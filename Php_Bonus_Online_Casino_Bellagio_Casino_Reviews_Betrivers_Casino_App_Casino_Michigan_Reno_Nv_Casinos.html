<p>Award-winning connectivity, security, iGaming data center, and cloud solutions provider Continent 8 Technologies is moving forward with its bold first-to-market expansion plans in North America. The leading provider has received the green light from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) to launch its first public cloud offering in Pennsylvania. The provider has already established a steady presence in the state with a series of points of presence and data centers.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Is Ready to Jump on the Bandwagon</p>
<p>Continent 8 will provide its Gaming Cloud solutions to suppliers, operators, and gamblers within the Keystone State, following the lead of New Jersey and Ontario, two regions that have already jumped the wagon.</p>
<p>What does the news mean for Pennsylvania’s iGaming suppliers and providers? For starters, they will get to cater to the growing demands for state-of-the-art cloud gaming solutions with Continent 8’s fully scalable and resilient IaaS platform that accepts multiple tenants. This is an important detail worth mentioning here. State laws require Gaming Cloud tenants to own a PGCB license, while the hardware that comprises the Gaming Cloud should be placed at primary and secondary locations provided by Continent 8. The Gaming Cloud will also enable users to host Virtual Machines as part of their infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Gaming Cloud comes with a self-service portal featuring provisioning based on templates, Edge devices with versatile options, a plethora of cybersecurity solutions, distributed denial-of-service security, and the ability to integrate with Continent 8’s Cloud Connect, Multiprotocol Label Switching, and Co-Location services.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania customers who use the Gaming Cloud will no longer need to worry about having to constantly buy new hardware or do upkeep for the infrastructure. They will also benefit from extra flexibility when paying for the exact resources they need.</p>
<p>Speaking about the PGCB approval, Continent 8’s managing director of Americas Nick Nally called it an important part of their “aggressive strategy” of providing their regulated cloud to several new states in the country, in the context of the growing demand for cloud solutions.</p>
<p>Chief product officer Justin Cosnett acknowledged the high competition in the market and expressed the company’s delight to be the first service provider able to offer a regulated public cloud solution to Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>Continent 8 is Live in 24 US States</p>
<p>Ever since Pennsylvania made online gambling legal in 2017, Continent 8 has used its PGCB interactive Service Provider authorization to keep expanding its services, catering to the ever-changing needs of customers. The provider also has close ties with industry regulators, part of the fast-paced market in North America. This helps it make sure that all of its solutions are entirely compliant with its requirements. As a result, customers can freely leverage the first-mover advantage in a variety of US states.</p>
<p>Launched more than two decades ago, Continent 8 is currently live in 80 connected locations spread across four continents as well as 24 US states. There, operators and providers enjoy safe co-location and public and private cloud solutions that allow them to capitalize on the quick-developing cloud market. Continent 8 also has big plans to launch new sites in the coming months, given its main goal to become the number one connectivity and hosting service provider on the North American continent. At the end of January, the provider was appointed Advanced Consulting Partner for Amazon.</p>
