    <h1>Casinos In Puerto Rico River Casino Philadelphia Durant Ok Casino Primm Nevada Casinos L Auberge Cas</h1>

<p>First time playing this site...Fresh of the boat some would say. So I went to withdraw $500. The next day I deposited $64 and clicked ‘Friday 50% bonus’ total $96. Played it out with $0.74 left over.</p>
<p>I then pressed cancel on my $500 withdraw, so then balance was $500.74. When I realized what I had done, I went to withdraw the $500, but it then said I withdraw was locked and I needed to playout $1138.4 before I was even eligible to make withdraws?????????????? Playout amount is over twice the amount of real money that didn’t even have a bonus added to it....</p>
