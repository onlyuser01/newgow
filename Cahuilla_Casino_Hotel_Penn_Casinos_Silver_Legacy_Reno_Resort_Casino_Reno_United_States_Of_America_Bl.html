<p>Sportradar, a leading provider of sports entertainment and integrity services, has teamed up with the Big Ten Network. The companies will relaunch B1G+, which will allow consumers to directly subscribe for televised events that the Big Ten Network backs.</p>
<p>This will come with some 1,500 live streams of Big Ten Olympic Sports and video on demand of basketball and football games that have already aired on linear channels. Sportradar is lending the partnership its OTT solutions which will allow Big Ten Network to exert better overall back and front-end OTT management across numerous devices and media, such as mobile, web, connected TV apps, and more.</p>
<p>A particular strength of this partnership is that B1G+ streams can cover non-televised live events that will be accessible via subscription services. There will be numerous game highlights as well as original programming, more coverage from postseason tournaments and events. B1G+ will offer coverage from over 800 women’s events across numerous sports, including ice hockey, golf, basketball, swimming, and more.</p>
<p>Delivering a Tailored Approach to Sports Events</p>
<p>The solution will provide consumers with the opportunity to personalize their viewing experience and dabble in extensive sports programming that features Olympic sports and women’s sports. Commenting on this opportunity, Sportradar US CEO Arne Rees said:</p>
<p>“Today’s sports audience expects an experience that is highly personalized and tailored to their unique interests. Using our technology and data-driven OTT solutions, which have been developed and refined over the last 15 years, the Big Ten Network now has the flexibility it needs to meet and exceed viewer demands. We look forward to working closely with the Big Ten Network and helping them deliver an innovative product to their fans now and in the future.”</p>
<p>Sportradar is an established company with a strong focus on personalized content predicated on big data. Sportradar’s solutions always seek to elicit stronger engagement from audiences as well as boost awareness for sports products.</p>
<p>Joining the conversation, Big Ten Network SVP of programming and digital media Michael Calderon said that B1G+ is designed to ensure that consumers can benefit from the best experience and content available on Big Ten. From archived footage to live events, Calderon was thankful for the opportunity to use the Sportradar data-driven platform for the refreshed version of B1G+.</p>
<p>“[…] We believe the refreshed B1G+ will serve as a destination for college sports fans across the country as they follow one of the nation’s premier collegiate conferences,” Calderon explained.</p>
<p>Sportradar has been a well-known face in the world of sports. The company recently attracted Michael Jordan to its board of directors, and the company successfully completed its initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ in September.</p>
