<p>The UFC star – who crossed over to professional boxing in August 2017 to fight Floyd Mayweather, perhaps the greatest boxer in the history of the sport – last fought in the Octagon in October 2018 against Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
<p>McGregor was the underdog entering the bout at +145. The line was right, as Conor lost in Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena by submission (neck crank). A post-fight brawl, however, marred the competition and led to the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) issuing temporary suspensions for both mixed martial arts fighters.</p>
<p>On Monday, Miami Beach police allege that the 30-year-old grabbed the phone of a 22-year-old man outside the Fontainebleau around 5 am. McGregor is said to have stomped on the phone several times with his foot, and then left with the broken device.</p>
<p>McGregor has been charged with strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief, which are both felonies.</p>
<p>McGregor Released</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the UFC fighter have been busy in recent years.</p>
<p>In November of 2017, McGregor jumped into the cage after his Ireland teammate Charlie Ward won in his debut against John Redmond. McGregor wasn’t authorized as a cornerman and therefore wasn’t allowed inside the fighting space. When stopped by a commissioner, McGregor slapped the official in the face and continued celebrating.</p>
<p>Last April, McGregor charged at a bus inside the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn that was transporting Nurmagomedov. McGregor hurled a dolly at the bus and shattered a window. He later pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, performed five days of community service, and attended anger management classes.</p>
<p>As for this week, his lawyers say the story is being blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>Conor McGregor was involved in a minor altercation involving a cell phone that resulted in a call to law enforcement. Mr. McGregor appreciates the response of law enforcement and pledges his full cooperation,” the statement read.</p>
<p>McGregor went to Instagram to address the situation. He captioned a photo, “Patience in this world is a virtue I continue to work on. I love my fans dearly. Thank you all.”</p>
<p>McGregor posted $12,500 bail late Monday and was released.</p>
<p>Suspensions Lifted</p>
<p>McGregor’s temporary ban issued by the NAC is scheduled to be expire on April 5. There are already rumblings in the MMA world that McGregor wants a rematch with “The Eagle.”</p>
<p>Nurmagomedov’s manager Javier Mendez says nothing is set in stone. He added that until McGregor can prove he’s serious about getting back to his earlier form, his fighter won’t be entertaining a rematch.</p>
<p>“Khabib is not about the money, I am. Khabib goes, ‘No coach. He doesn’t deserve it (a rematch),'” Mendez told BJPenn.com recently.</p>
<p>Conor could get a chance to prove his worthiness by way of Donald Cerrone. Though the fight hasn’t been confirmed, it’s been speculated for months.</p>
<p>Should McGregor and Nurmagomedov get back in the ring, as of now Conor would again be the heavy underdog. Odds on the hypothetical match have Khabib at 1/4, or implied odds of 80 percent. McGregor is at 3/1.</p>
