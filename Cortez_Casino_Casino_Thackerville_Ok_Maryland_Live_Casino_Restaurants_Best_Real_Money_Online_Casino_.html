<p>Unibet Is Working on It</p>
<p>The Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Netherlands’ gambling authority, will investigate Unibet over alleged bonus-related issues. According to the regulator, numerous customers have encountered problems concerning the operator’s bonus system.</p>
<p>Unibet, a subsidiary of Kindred Group, entered the Dutch market on July 11. Yet, only a day later, several customers have already voiced their disgruntlement with the operator’s bonuses. The issues vary but the KSA confirmed that Unibet is aware of them. The authority also said that the operator is currently working hard to patch the problems and provide players with uncompromised experiences.</p>
<p>Customers who experienced problems can contact Unibet’s help center on Unibet’s Dutch website and learn more about the situation.</p>
<p>Kindred Just Re-entered the Market</p>
<p>Unibet is a subsidiary of Kindred Group, a gambling company that operates several brands. Kindred Group was kicked out from the Netherlands after its market was re-regulated in October 2021. As a result, the company’s revenues experienced an immediate sharp decline.</p>
<p>Since the Netherlands is one of Kindred’s main markets, the operator quickly began a licensing process, hoping to re-enter the jurisdiction. Fortunately, Kindred’s application was approved in June, paving the way for its re-launch in the country. Still, it will likely take a while before the operator’s revenues rebound to their pre-exit levels.</p>
<p>Kindred Group is a company that takes player protection very seriously and is always working hard to protect its customers. In April, the company announced that only 3.3% of its total profits come from high-risk gamblers. Henrik Tjärnström, chief executive officer of Kindred, vowed to lower this number even further.</p>
<p>The KSA Continues to Fight for a Healthy Gambling Sector</p>
<p>The Netherlands has quickly cemented itself as one of the best gambling markets in Europe. The KSA has refrained from forcing strict deposit limit rules on operators but has been very proactive in punishing those who refuse to follow the rules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regulator has continued working hard against the black market and offshore operators that undermine the legalized alternative. Out of all European markets, the Netherlands has been one of the most successful in weeding out unlicensed operators so far. The regulator even told consumers that illegal gambling will soon disappear completely from the country.</p>
<p>Speaking about offshore operators, the KSA just reprimanded Gammix for operating in the country despite not having a license. The authority pointed out that several of Gammix’s websites are available to Dutch bettors. If the operator does not exit the market soon, it risks hefty fines.</p>
