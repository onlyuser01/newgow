    <h1>Casino Vicksburg Crazy Time Casino Goldie S Shoreline Casino Closest Casino To Me Elk Grove Casino P</h1>

<p>Hello, I provided them with all information required which included passport photos and a selfie with ID, photos of my bank card with covered CVV code as they advised on their website and proof of address. Despite me uploading the documents multiple times they kept rejecting my withdrawals and asking me to upload the same documents again. I still have access to the account and the balance remains just over 1000. Their withdrawal limit is 500 and they only allow one withdrawal at a time so I started with that but all withdrawals rejected despite sending the documents repeatedly. They have now stopped communicating with me entirely or informing me why I’m being rejected.</p>
<p>Initially I played with ‘bonus spins’ but I had met the wagering requirements which they confirmed with me. All the correspondence I have related only to verification documents being the issue, but I provided everything required multiple times. I can send you what was uploaded to their site if neeeded.</p>
<p>I had unauthorised transactions made on my banking which was traced back to the original deposit I made with them so have had to cancel my card. It seems they have been stealing small amounts at a time hoping it would go unnoticed which initially it did and then it progressed to larger amounts.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
