<p>The AI-powered safer gambling company will welcome Niamh Gallagher and Stephen Aupy, two experienced professionals</p>
<p>Mindway AI, an award-winning Danish software company that helps gambling operators identify at-risk players, has reinforced its team with two new additions. As announced on LinkedIn, the software specialist will welcome Niamh Gallagher as social media and marketing manager and Stephen Aupy as business development manager.</p>
<p>Both of the new appointees are seasoned gambling industry veterans who are also skilled in their respective positions.</p>
<p>Gallagher, for example, has worked with the iGaming B2B publisher and networking group EGR for more than six years. She served the company as head of event content and was eventually promoted to group head of content.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Mindway AI, Gallagher had a short stint as the head of marketing of USAbility. In that position, Gallagher was responsible for designing, owning and driving all aspects of the company’s marketing strategy. She will now continue her marketing efforts as Mindway AI’s social media and marketing manager.</p>
<p>Aupy, on the other hand, comes from ganban, a company that excels in self-exclusion tools, helping people moderate their gaming behavior. He joined gamban in 2018 and served the company as a business development manager before getting promoted to VP of strategic partnerships in 2019.</p>
<p>The New Hires Are Thrilled to Join Mindway AI</p>
<p>The new hires were welcomed on board. Speaking of their appointment, Mindway AI released the following statement:</p>
<p>We are so thrilled to build on the already strong foundations of the Mindway AI team and look forward to many future successes with Niamh and Stephen on board! Mindway AI statement</p>
<p>Gallagher shared her sentiments on joining the company, thanking her previous colleagues for their continued support. Speaking of her new position, Gallagher said that she cannot wait to begin.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to start this new journey and help to build on the already massive success of the team at Mindway AI. Thank you so much to Rasmus Kjaergaard and Paula Murphy for this opportunity. Let the fun begin! Niamh Gallagher, social media and marketing manager, Mindway AI</p>
<p>Aupy also released a statement on joining Mindway AI, saying that artificial intelligence is becoming more and more integral to our everyday lives. He said that he is excited to join the company as a business development manager and work alongside professionals such as Kjaergaard, Murphy and Gallagher. Aupy used the opportunity to promote his new company’s solutions:</p>
<p>I would urge any of my industry peers that would like to understand how both the GameScanner &amp; Gamalyze solutions can help protect your customer base and make your business more sustainable to please feel free to drop me a direct message to learn more. Stephen Aupy, business development manager, Mindway AI</p>
