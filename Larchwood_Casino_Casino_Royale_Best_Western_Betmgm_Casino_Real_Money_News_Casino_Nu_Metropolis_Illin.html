    <h1>Larchwood Casino Casino Royale Best Western Betmgm Casino Real Money News Casino Nu Metropolis Illin</h1>

<p>Dear Petronela,</p>
<p>I usually do the same kind of bank transfer and mostly I received it within a few hours or sometimes within half an hour. Never took time more than 6 hours.</p>
<p>However, for this particular withdrawal, they took 3 days and then mentioned that it is paid on the website but actually it was not paid. When I emailed them they explained to me that on their side it has been done but I didn't receive it. Then they told me that it is a part of a bank that is pending and they are in touch with the bank to resolve the issue (on 4th Jan 2023).</p>
<p>However, after that, they never update me about the status even after asking them. They just say it will be received shortly. Sometimes they say it is already paid so send your bank statement to verify. I have provided them with bank statements many times. But their customer support team is not well-trained and I think it is not systematic. So every new chat person asks for the details again and again and they can't understand what I am asking for.</p>
<p>I am getting frustrated since then because since then I made 2 more deposits of INR10,000 and INR3,000 on 6th January. Both deposits are rejected by them and told me that the money will be returned to my bank account in 3 working days. However, I haven't received that money yet. Also, I made many withdrawals from the 6th to today but out of them, almost 70% of withdrawals were rejected by them after a few hours. (only 2 out of 12 withdrawals were paid; the other was rejected and added to my player account.) It looks fishy now. Even today I made a deposit of 5000. On the website, it is mentioned that the processing time of the deposit is min 2 minutes and a maximum of 15 minutes but after 5 hours they reject it saying it will be refunded. Also, chat support is just a name; they never reply. So I have 7750 withdrawals + 10,000 + 3,000 + 5,000 deposits. the total amount of INR 25,750 is pending with either bank or them. The problem is they do not clarify my problems and do not accept that they are at fault or their system has some problem.</p>
<p>Due to this, I feel that they may be going to scam their customers shortly. I feel they are doing this intentionally because someone can understand that withdrawal may take time, but what about deposits? Is it possible that all the deposits are getting rejected? and even after six days, it is not returned? I'm playing for the last 3 years but this kind of issue never arise.</p>
