    <h1>Kansas Casinos Las Vegas Nevada Casino Roses Casino Pokerstars Casino Promo Code Harrahs Hotel And C</h1>

<p>The distinction puts the company neck-and-neck with some of the best titles in the igaming world. It offers a chance to prove the unique player-focused insight that went into the development of this innovative game.</p>
<p>Behold the Storied Dragon Fortress – Battle of the Castle Slot</p>
<p>Dragon Fortress – Battle of the Castle is a unique mash-up of arcade and slot. It was designed for players born in the eighties who grew up playing video games and visiting arcades at the weekend. NetGaming ran a fun promotion amongst the igaming community to coin their main character’s name. Colin the Conqueror, the dragon-slaying knight in shiny armor.</p>
<p>Since it launched, the game has been one of the most original titles in igaming. Compatible with all modern devices and operating systems, this 5-reel, 3-row and 243-ways game brings you a plethora of great features to explore. Unlimited Dragon Free Spins and an epic boss fight that pays the player regardless of whether Colin wins or loses is an attractive feature of this game. The entertainment value reaches its peak when Colin enters the dedicated boss fight round where he gets to slay the dragon.</p>
<p>Dragon Fortress is designed with a fresh and dynamic gaming background. It sees Colin climb the staircases of a castle where every level is filled with rewards – and a very hungry dragon waiting at the end. There are all sorts of great ways to boost your winnings along the way, including random wilds, wild reels, and multipliers up to 10x with more cash prizes. To add to these features, there are mini-games that the players can buy into or trigger naturally.</p>
<p>In a word, Dragon Fortress – Battle of the Castle is a uniquely-themed and developed game that has a lot to offer. The title is a truly unique addition to the array of igaming titles that have appeared in the industry over the past years.</p>
<p>More than Just Retro Graphics – Innovative Gameplay at the Core</p>
<p>Colin stands out in more than just the Retro Style category with innovative gameplay, smartly integrated mechanics, and a vivid theme. NetGaming CEO Pallavi Deshmukh was excited to see the game win this nomination:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be nominated for this award. The award category could not be more appropriate for Dragon Fortress – Battle of the Castle, and to be nominated along with some of the biggest names in the igaming industry is a testament to all the hard work our team has put in.</p>
<p>We wanted to capture the nostalgia of the eighties and craft a game that was unique in more than one way. Developing this game was no easy feat: we had to build multiple features, each with its own gameplay and triggers. We also had a lot of fun with the launch marketing campaign to name the game’s beloved hero, Colin the Conqueror. We are looking forward to attending the awards with our industry colleagues.”</p>
<p>NetGaming is looking forward to the CasinoBeats Developer Awards 2023 on May 25 to see Colin shower himself with even more accolades.</p>
