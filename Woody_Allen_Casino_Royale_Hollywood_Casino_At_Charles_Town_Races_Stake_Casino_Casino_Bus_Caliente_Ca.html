<p>Gustavo Cisneros at One Bit Tech commented that the company is pleased to join forces with Pragmatic. Moreover, he acknowledged that Pragmatic is already well known in the region. In conclusion, Cisneros predicted that Pragmatic’s innovative and popular portfolio is undoubtedly going to be well received by One Bit Tech’s partners.</p>

Before that, the company strengthened its leadership team by appointing Irina Cornides. More recently, Pragmatic announced that it expanded its Drops &amp; Wins program. As a result, the unique promotional platform that offered users significant monthly rewards will now run through February 9, 2023.</p>
