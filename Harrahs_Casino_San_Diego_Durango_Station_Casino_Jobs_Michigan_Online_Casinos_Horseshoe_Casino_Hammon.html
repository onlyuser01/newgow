<p>Pariplay onboarded AGS content to its Fusion platform and launched it with PlayAlberta.ca, the only licensed online gambling website in Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>Pariplay, a leading iGaming content aggregator, has inked a new agreement with American Gaming Systems (AGS), a provider of gaming solutions and titles for operators. As a result, AGS content has been onboarded to the aggregator’s Fusion platform and is now live in Alberta.</p>
<p>Pariplay Will Provide PlayAlberta with AGS Content</p>
<p>Under the agreement, AGS content is now live through PlayAlberta.ca in the Canadian province of Alberta. This notably makes AGS the first Fusion studio partner in the province.</p>
<p>The two parties will now leverage the Fusion platform to power PlayAlberta.ca with AGS’ in-house games. These include fan-favorite titles such as Capital Gains, Tiger Lord and Golden Wins that will launch in Canada, allowing local gamblers to enjoy premium gaming experiences.</p>
<p>The expansion of PlayAlberta.ca’s content offering was made possible by the partnership between Pariplay and NeoPollard Interactive, a leading provider of lucrative North American iLottery programs.</p>
<p>The Pariplay Fusion platform now offers more than 14,000 games from over 80 studios to the aggregator’s partners. In addition, Pariplay clients can enjoy a rich selection of robust back-office conversion and retention tools, helping them establish a loyal player base.</p>
<p>AGS Is Excited to Launch with Pariplay</p>
<p>AGS Interactive is very excited to make a foray into Alberta and become Pariplay Fusion’s first partnering studio in the province. Stuart Carr, AGS’ senior vice president, spoke about the agreement. He praised the fusion platform for its broad product offering and said that he is happy that AGS’ games will now be a part of that portfolio. Carr concluded that his team may expand the agreement with Pariplay and its Fusion platform and launch into other regulated jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>This launch provides us with a great platform for further expansion across the continent in tandem with Pariplay and Fusion. Stuart Carr, SVP, AGS</p>
<p>AGS, according to Carr, is ambitious about cementing itself as a leading supplier in North America. The launch with PlayAlberta is a thrilling opportunity for the company since it is the province’s only legal iGaming site.</p>
<p>Adrian Bailey, Pariplay’s managing director, also commented on the agreement. He lauded AGS as a reputable slots developer that is capable of engaging players across both the iGaming and land-based verticals.</p>
<p>To take its [AGS’] content live in Alberta through PlayAlberta.ca is a great moment and a first step in our important mission of delivering the widest range of third-party content to operators and their players in the province. Adrian Bailey, MD, Pariplay</p>
<p>Bailey concluded that he is looking forward to seeing customers’ reactions to the supplier’s innovative titles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pariplay recently welcomed Slotmill as its latest Ignite partner.</p>
