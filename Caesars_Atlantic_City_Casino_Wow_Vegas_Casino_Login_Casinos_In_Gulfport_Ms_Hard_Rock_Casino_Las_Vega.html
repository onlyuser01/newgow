<p>It’s time for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics. The team from Massachusetts leads the series 3-2, which means that they need to win just one more game to win the conference and get themselves a spot in the NBA Championship Game.</p>
<p>The big question is can they do it? Oddsmakers sure think so, making the Celtics odds-on favorite in Game 6. One of the main reasons is that the game is played on their turf. At TD Garden in Boston, this team went 28-13 in the regular season, while also winning five of the eight home games played in the postseason.</p>

<p>Last Chance for Miami Heat</p>
<p>The Heat started the Eastern Conference finals with a win at home. They were favored to win, and they did what they were expected to do. Unfortunately for them, in the next game, they got destroyed by the Celtics. The final score was 127-102 for the visiting team.</p>
<p>From there, the series moved to Boston. Once again, the Heat won the first time only to get destroyed in the following game. In Game 4, the Celtics beat them 102-82.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference finals came back to Miami on Wednesday evening. The home support didn’t help the Heat – the visitors won 93-80.</p>
<p>What this all means is that in order for Miami to stay in the race for the Eastern Conference title, the Heat needs to win on Friday. Oddsmakers, however, don’t think they’re going to pull it off.</p>
<p>In-Form Boston Celtics Looking for Third Straight Win</p>
<p>The Celtics are coming off back-to-back wins, in which their players did great both in the offense and defense. The one who stands out with his brilliant performances is Jayson Tatum.</p>
<p>In the previous game, the forward scored 22 points, while making 12 rebounds, and nine assists. He was even better in the game before, with 31 points, eight rebounds, and five assists.</p>
<p>Jaylen Brown is another player who’s been terrific so far in the conference finals. Boston’s guard has scored a total of 125 points in the five games with Miami.</p>
<p>Miami Heat vs Boston Celtics Game 6 Prediction</p>
<p>Boston’s key men have been in fantastic shape lately, and if they continue to play at the same level, their fans have nothing to worry about. Beating the Heat in Game 6 shouldn’t be much of a problem, especially considering that Friday’s game is played on the Celtics’ turf.</p>
<p>Picks: Boston Celtics to win and cover the spread; “under” should hit this time</p>
