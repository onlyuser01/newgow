<p>The Southwest plane had left Harry Reid International Airport early morning and was heading to Columbus, Ohio. At 6:33 a.m., a pilot suffered a medical emergency that included stomach pain and fainting, ABC News reported.</p>
<p>During the flight, someone told ground crew over the radio the pilot was stricken and “became incapacitated,” a monitored radio transmission from the plane revealed.</p>
<p>He is in the back of the aircraft right now with the flight attendants. But we need to get him on an ambulance immediately,” the flight crew announced in a radio broadcast, according to ABC.</p>
<p>A nurse on the flight helped to treat the ill pilot.</p>
<p>He was transported to a hospital upon landing in Las Vegas. His condition as of Thursday wasn’t immediately available. It’s unclear what caused his illness.</p>
<p>Off-Duty Pilot Saves Day</p>
<p>With the help of the unnamed off-duty pilot, the plane landed at Harry Reid Airport. That pilot worked for a different airline. The flight landed in Las Vegas safely at about 8 a.m. It was identified as Southwest Flight 6013.</p>
<p>The pilot reportedly entered the cockpit and assisted with radio communications while a second Southwest pilot flew the plane, the report said.</p>
<p>The Southwest plane was in the air for about 1 hour and 17 minutes, CNN reported citing data from FlightAware.com. The plane flew over southern Utah, north of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, before it was forced to return and land in Las Vegas, the Independent reported.</p>
<p>After landing, Southwest put on a different flight crew to fly the passengers later on Wednesday to Columbus, where the plane landed safely at John Glenn Columbus International Airport.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>Fifth Incapacitated Pilot</p>
<p>Wednesday’s incident marks the “fifth pilot incapacitation that I’m aware of in the past two weeks,” Josh Yoder, an airline pilot, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If the off-duty pilot wasn’t on the plane, a flight attendant reportedly could have assisted in the cockpit while the second pilot flew the plane.</p>
<p>“We commend the crew for their professionalism and appreciate our customers’ patience and understanding regarding the situation,” Southwest Airlines said in a statement quoted by Las Vegas TV station KVVU.</p>
