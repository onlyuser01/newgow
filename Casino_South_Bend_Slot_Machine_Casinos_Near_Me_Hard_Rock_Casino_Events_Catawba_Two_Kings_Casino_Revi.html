    <h1>Casino South Bend Slot Machine Casinos Near Me Hard Rock Casino Events Catawba Two Kings Casino Revi</h1>

<p>I agree that in your case, you have every right to be angry. On the other hand, this is the only act of unfairness we have come across with Izzi so far. Thus, the rating won't fall too low in that regard.</p>
<p>I'm sorry it ended like this. Please be assured once the casino wants its precious rating back, someone needs to address your complaint again.</p>
<p>Allow me to quote from "Casino complaint resolution":</p>
<p>What will be the consequences of your complaint?</p>
<p>Let's start by stating that not all complaints are justified. Therefore, if the circumstances and evidence show that the casino has not done anything that we consider to be unfair, the complaint will be closed and categorized as being 'rejected'. The same happens if you stop communicating with us after submitting your complaint.</p>
<p>If the complaint is justified and the casino has done something unfair, the ideal scenario is that we resolve the complaint to your liking. In this case, the complaint will be closed and categorized as being 'resolved'.</p>
<p>If the complaint is justified and we are unable to resolve it, it is closed and categorized as being 'unresolved'. This happens when the casino either does not respond to us or refuses to do what we consider to be fair in that specific situation. You will not get your desired outcome but the complaint will be saved in our system, the casino will be punished with a lower rating from us and our review of the casino will warn other players of what happened. What's more, if the casino wants to improve its rating in the future, it will be forced to address the complaint, so there is a chance that your complaint will be resolved at a later date.</p>
<p>At least there is still some chance for resolution.</p>
