<p>Authorities in Norway extended the exclusive rights of Norsk Rikstoto to offer gambling on horses for the next ten years, the operator announced in a press release Friday.</p>
<p>Problem Gambling Prevention Is Key</p>
<p>The Government justified the decision to extend the license for another decade via the operator’s efforts to ensure the implementation of public control measures and prevent the negative effects of gambling that have become a cause for the struggle of many Norwegians already.</p>
<p>“Norsk Rikstoto shows that they take the role of exclusive rights provider seriously, and that is good,” said Minister for Culture and Equality Anette Trettebergstuen, outlining that the major task for the government regarding the market is to implement a gambling policy that will ensure gambling is experienced without its negative sides.</p>
<p>“The Norwegian Parliament has implemented a number of measures to reduce the risk of gambling problems and gambling addiction,” Trettebergstuen continued, highlighting the aim of the authorities to ensure that sports and good causes will continue to reap benefits from the gambling industry profits.</p>
<p>Best-Suited for the Task</p>
<p>Following the license extension, Norsk Tipping and Norsk Rikstoto will remain as the exclusive providers of gambling on horse racing. The government considers the vertical one that requires particular public control due to its high prizes, high turnover and high risk of creating gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>Further, Norsk Rikstoto has established itself as a reliable medium between the gambling industry and organizations that promote equestrian sports, horse keeping and horse breeding in the country, passing some of its profits to support the industry.</p>
<p>Founded in 1982 Norsk Rikstoto made a significant move towards enhancing communication with its customers via a two-way integration deal with Agillic and Tealium earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Norwegian National Tote horse racing foundation turned to marketing automation to achieve a more personalized communication approach across all channels, inform customers on how to place bets and ensure that the responsible gambling message is received and integrated into the entire customer journey.</p>
<p>Upgrade of Betting Systems</p>
<p>Months before that, Norsk Rikstoto moved to enhance its betting system via an agreement with Global Tote under which the BetMakers Technology-owned supplier agreed to implement its Quantum Tote solution to replace Norsk Rikstoto’s pari-mutuel wagering system.</p>
<p>The dispute between Norway’s regulator, Lotteritilsynet, and Kindred Group-owned subsidiary Trannel, operating the Bingo, Mariacasino, Storspiller and Unibet brands was one of the central gambling industry topics in the year.</p>
