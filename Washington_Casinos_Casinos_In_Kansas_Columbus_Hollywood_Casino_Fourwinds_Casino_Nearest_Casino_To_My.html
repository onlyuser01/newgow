<p>Parimatch and its official partner from Italian Serie A Juventus launched a new digital campaign built around some of the most popular faces of the team at Allianz Stadium.</p>
<p>Experiences to Resonate and Inspire</p>
<p>The short video produced in collaboration with Ukrainian production house Electric Sheep Film features the names of Cristiano Ronaldo, Arthur Melo, Luiz Da Silva Danilo, Alvaro Morata, and Wojciech Szczesny, and is looking to increase brand awareness for Parimatch among football fans in Italy.</p>
<p>The football stars perform different types of kicks and saves during the video infused with the typical yellow color and logos of Parimatch to deliver what both parties promised in terms of “unparalleled entertainment experiences that resonate and inspire” by the time they teamed up and bring the brand closer to audiences.</p>
<p>“For the last 6 months, we have been watching the partnership of two strong brands providing great entertainment to millions of fans all over the world.” Ivan Liashenko, CMO, Parimatch</p>
<p>Juventus and the gambling company joined forces in September last year in a deal that named Parimatch official betting partner of the winner of 36 titles from the Italian top-flight league football club. The fusion of complementary energies has been strengthening ever since Liashenko outlined.</p>
<p>“The connection of outstanding football players representing one of the strongest clubs in the world with Parimatch’s energy and boldness is truly a sight to be seen.” Ivan Liashenko, CMO, Parimatch</p>
<p>No Restrictions for Creativity</p>
<p>Chief commercial officer at Parimatch Kateryna Amirkhamova added that the collaboration between Parimatch and Juventus for the new campaign is proof that even under extreme quarantine restrictions creativity can flourish.</p>
<p>“…we tried to convey each player’s emotions and charisma in the shades of our brand. I believe that Juventus and Parimatch make a great team, and the video encapsulates the synergy of our raw energies and power perfectly.” Kateryna Amirkhamova, CCO, Parimatch</p>
<p>The partnership deal between Parimatch and Juventus was only one of many for the gambling company looking to establish its presence on the global scene and especially on markets where it has operations.</p>
<p>The brand has presence in the English Premier League via Leicester City and Everton and is the official betting partner for the Spanish La Liga after an agreement with the top flight league was signed in October last year.</p>
<p>Besides football, Parimatch has brand ambassadors for a range of sports, including mixed martial arts fighter Connor McGregor and Brazilian eSports player Marcelo Augusto David known as Coldzera, after the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) pro teamed up with the brand last month.</p>
