    <h1>Casino En Ligne Parx Casino Shippensburg Pa Oyo Casino Hotels In Thackerville Ok Near Winstar Casino</h1>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>All withdrawals are subject to a 48 hour pending period before they are flushed from the casino account. During this time the withdrawal may be reversed. If the end of the pending period falls during a weekend, funds are available for reversal until the next business day after the 48 our pending period has ended, which was the case in this scenario.</p>
<p>I can see that the reversals were made using the same device and IP address that the player regularly plays on.</p>
<p>The chat rep advised the player they could view the reversal transactions inside their playcheck during a chat session on 1st August 2023.</p>
<p>Go into playcheck from inside your casino account and choose custom date range 20 jul 23 - 25 jul 23</p>
<p>Click "View" next to each session.</p>
<p>Click "Show detailed statement" at top.</p>
<p>Ensure you are viewing 100 records at a time on the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Every transaction that says "Transfer ECash to Casino Credits" is a reversal. You can search for this phrase using Ctrl + F then typing it into the search box or copying and pasting.</p>
<p>For example, in session 696976224 the first transaction (ID 22360) is a $200 reversal.</p>
<p>You can go through every session and every transaction and see all of the reversals.</p>
<p>Tomas - I would suggest to have the player email you screenshots of the playcheck after following the instructions above.</p>
<p>If the player is unable to do this, their only recourse is ecogra who we must show internal records to and are bound by their decision. However, looking at the playcheck and the backend, since the player has indeed reversed these funds this will be a waste of everyone's time.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
