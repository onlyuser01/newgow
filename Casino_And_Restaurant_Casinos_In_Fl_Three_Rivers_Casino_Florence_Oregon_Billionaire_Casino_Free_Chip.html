<p>The two parties will monetize their relationship while delivering new ways for bettors and fans to experience tennis.</p>
<p>Sports technology specialist Sportradar has signed a multi-year deal with Tennis Data Innovations (TDI), a joint venture of ATP and ATP Media. Under the deal, TDI will provide Sportradar with global data and streaming rights for betting, as well as media data rights, for all ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour events.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, this partnership’s main aim will be to drive commercial growth within the tennis sector and bolster fan engagement through the development of new betting and media products.</p>
<p>Starting in December this year, Sportradar’s ATP Service+ purpose-built suite of solutions will “offer new and dynamic ways for fans and bettors to engage with tennis.” To that end, Sportradar will leverage next-gen, value-add products and services that utilize previously unavailable deep data.</p>
<p>ATP Service+ also features improved streaming capabilities, enhancing live streams with in-play betting markets, personalized betting products, short-form video highlights and cutting-edge 3D animations.</p>
<p>The collaboration will also see Sportradar and TDI work on media products that go into in-depth analysis of games. The two parties will also use Sportradar’s OTT solution to stream live match coverage of the ATP Challenger Tour, via ATP’s Challenger TV.</p>
<p>That’s not all, however, as the two parties will also create a joint Tennis Innovation Lab that will seek to make further advancements in the sector. Finally, Sportradar will provide the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour with its Integrity Services, helping them prevent match-fixing and corruption.</p>
<p>A Truly Collaborative Partnership</p>
<p>TDI’s chief executive officer, David Lampitt, commented on the new deal, calling it a “landmark opportunity” to realize his group’s growth ambitions and take fan engagement to the next level. Lampitt is certain that the partnership with Sportradar will allow his team to bolster fan immersion, providing tennis aficionados with more entertaining experiences.</p>
<p>The partnership will be a catalyst for innovation to create unique growth opportunities across new global markets. Our aim is not only to deliver great enhancements for our existing fans but also attract a generation of new fans to the game. David Lampitt, CEO, TDI</p>
<p>Carsten Koerl, Sportradar’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, saying that Sportradar’s position as the leading sports tech company positions it to deliver against ATP’s ambitious plans.</p>
<p>This truly collaborative partnership will result, through the application of technologies, such as computer vision and AI, in the creation of engaging products and services as part of our ATP Service+ offering. Carsten Koerl, CEO, Sportradar</p>
<p>Koerl concluded that this will effectively allow the two parties to monetize their relationship while delivering new ways for bettors and fans to experience tennis.</p>
<p>A month ago, Sportradar secured a temporary license in Maine, further expanding its reach.</p>
