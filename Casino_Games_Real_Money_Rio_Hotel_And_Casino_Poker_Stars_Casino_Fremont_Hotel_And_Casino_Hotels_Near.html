<p>Vision NextGen to Bring Benefits for Stanleybet</p>
<p>The first performance-driven, retail, content and technology provider for betting operators, Vermantia announced that it inked a new deal with Stanleybet, a leading betting operator. Under the terms of the new supply agreement, Stanleybet received access to Vermantia’s Vision NextGen product.</p>
<p>Vision NextGen is a solution that fills a market gap, allowing the use of data templates in different sizes, shapes, formats and orientations. The digital signage solution supports multi-view or single view screens as well as video walls. Vision NextGen is easy to use and can be set up either on-site or remotely and controlled in real-time.</p>
<p>Currently, Stanleybet has an online ADM license in Italy. Thanks to the new supply agreement, the company will now be able to leverage Vermantia’s unique product. Moreover, Stanleybet gains access to functionalities such as “playout services for virtual games, increasingly over time, and IP streaming delivery through Vision NextGen, for their entire European operations.”</p>
<p>Besides Stanleybet, Vermantia completed another deal earlier this year back in June with Eurobet, a company that operates on the Italian market. Consequently, the leading operator gained access to Vermantia’s Virtual Greyhound Racing Product.</p>
<p>Vermantia’s Product to Revolutionize the Way Retail Shops Operate</p>
<p>Stanleybet’s CEO, Giovanni Garrisi, revealed that the company is pleased to add such a high-performing product. Additionally, he acknowledged that Vision NextGen will help Stanleybet enhance the opportunities which the company offers to its customers, as well as partners. According to Garrisi, the company is aware that it is challenging for Vermantia “to enter in new networks and markets across Europe.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to adopt within our international offer a high performing vertical product that, after the due integration process, will enhance the opportunities offered to our partners and customers.” Giovanni Garrisi, CEO at Stanleybet Group</p>
<p>He highlighted that Stanleybet believes the partnership will help speed up the company’s content delivery strategy, while at the same time providing benefits for its consumers and “reducing the time-to-market for new features and new products by several factors.” In conclusion, he added that undoubtedly, the quality of services, products and experiences for the users will remain excellent.</p>
<p>“We are proud to have our latest product earn the trust and become a useful day-to-day tool for our newest and valued partner, Stanleybet.” George Fotopoulos, COO at Vermantia</p>
<p>Vermantia’s COO, George Fotopoulos, added that the company is proud to see Stanleybet choose their latest product with confidence. He outlined that the long-term goal of the company is to establish successful deals in all European countries where Stanleybet operates. In conclusion, Fotopoulos stated that he believes that Vision NextGen will “revolutionize the way retail shops operate.”</p>
