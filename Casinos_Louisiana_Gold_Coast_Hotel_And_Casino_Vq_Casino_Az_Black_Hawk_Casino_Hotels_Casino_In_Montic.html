<p>Gunnar Nelson Plotting Another Submission Win</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Icelandic fighter is an absolute genius on the floor. He’s a 3rd-degree black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu who’s won the gold two times at the BJJ Pan American Championship. His record in mixed martial arts is 18-5-1, with two-thirds of his wins happening by submission.</p>
<p>He’s been fighting in the UFS for more than a decade, but in the last couple of years, Nelson hasn’t been too successful. HE did win his most recent fight – against Takashi Sato by unanimous decision – but before that, he was 1-3.</p>
<p>Two of those three losses happened by decision, while he also lost one by knockout in round 1 (vs. Santiago Ponzinibbio). Strike defense is actually one of his biggest weaknesses. In the UFC, he defends only 50% of the significant strikes his opponents threw at him. The reason why this should worry him ahead of UFC 286 is that Barberena lands 5.92 significant strikes per minute.</p>
<p>Bryan Barberena In Mood for Fighting</p>
<p>Bryan Barberena is the kind of fighter who never refuses a fight. He was offered to fight Nelson a month before UFC 286, and he gladly accepted. This may seem strange considering that the last time he fought was last December.</p>
<p>That’s when we saw him lose by submission to Rafael Dos Anjos in round 2 of a fight that saw Barberena get taken down four times. Speaking of takedowns, Bam Bam tends to suffer a lot of them. In fact, in the five fights before the Dos Anjos fight, he got taken down 22 times in total.</p>
<p>This is something that needs to worry him a lot ahead of the fight with Nelson, who’s a fighter that averages 1.86 takedowns and who’s got a TD accuracy of 60%.</p>
<p>Gunnar Nelson vs Bryan Barberena Prediction</p>
<p>Gunnar Nelson shouldn’t care much that his opponent isn’t Daniel Rodriguez. Sure, in the first part of the camp, he was training for D-Rod, but the good news for him is that Barberena isn’t much different. Both are brawlers who tend to hit a lot, but also get hit a lot. Most importantly for Nelson, both are very susceptible to takedowns.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s clear that Nelson’s path to victory is going to be to take Barberena down and finish him with a submission. Will he succeed? We think so, yeah.</p>
<p>Pick: Gunnar Nelson to win by submission</p>
