<p>Playstudios has announced the appointment of industry veteran Mickey Sonnino as its new global chief operating officer</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-located creator of the iconic Tetris mobile app and other popular mobile games has used the voice of founder and chief executive officer Andrew Pascal to make the announcement.</p>
<p>Sonnino to Manage Playstudios’ Global Operations</p>
<p>Sonnino will report directly to Pascal and join a global management team while setting up her new headquarter in Israel. She will be responsible for managing the operations of Playstudios’ facilities in the Middle East, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.</p>
<p>Pascal praised Sonnino’s “breadth and depth of experience in both gaming and consumer marketing”, expressing confidence in her ability to boost their operating performance and help the company become an even greater innovator in the industry. He emphasized that the new chief operating officer’s “background and sensibilities” have turned her into the ideal candidate for the position.</p>
<p>Sonnino has joined the developer of the groundbreaking playAWARDS loyalty after spending more than seven years with Playtika. There, she filled in important positions such as senior vice president of strategic communication, general manager of Slotomania, and vice president of marketing and monetization for Slotoman.</p>
<p>Before joining the pioneer in the games industry with over 34 million active users on a monthly basis, Sonnino also spent some time with Revlon, the manufacturer of skincare, color cosmetics, fragrances, and hair color products. Sonnino was a senior brand manager for Revlon’s New York and London facilities.</p>
<p>Prior to that, she also spent four years as senior brand manager for Bristol-Myers Squibb, an international biopharmaceutical company. Her resume also includes a position as a software developer for QXL.</p>
<p>Sonnino, Eager to Support Playstudios Dynamic Evolution</p>
<p>Discussing her new appointment, Sonnino spoke about the important role played by gaming at the crossing between media and entertainment. She also took the opportunity to praise the company’s unique position and capacity to grow at a fast pace.</p>
<p>Sonnino expressed excitement for being allowed to bring her contribution and use her expertise and guidance to steer Playstudios on the right track in its “dynamic stage in its evolution.”</p>
<p>Sonnino, who holds an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and a B.A. in computer science from the University in Tel Aviv University, further acknowledged the success of Playstudios’ playAWARDS platform.</p>
<p>She discussed the innovative player retention tool designed for the gaming industry that is part of the platform. Sonnino also mentioned the platform’s ability to give Rewards Partners access to a unique audience made of “highly motivated and unusually focused” players.</p>
<p>Last October, Playstudios acquired the leading mobile game developer Brainium for $70 million.</p>
