<p>Jammin’ Jars review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Set in the most disco greengrocers you’ve ever seen, Jammin’ Jars ensures you get your five fruit and veg a day even as you party under its disco-ball. With spotlights and dancefloor glow patterns in the background, it is a cheerful slot that Push Gaming have done their best to kit out with plenty of vaguely jam based features.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animations are clean and well rendered, with high def visuals and nicely drawn symbols. The physics of the falling fruit is nicely done and the win animations are quick and varied, making for a visual fruit-salad that is constantly changing.</p>
<p>You can see some nice winnings with just one Jar symbol if you manage to hit it few times in one spin</p>
<p>The music is a truly horrible funk-beat that is best muted immediately on startup. Unfortunately, there is no option to turn just the music off which means you will also miss out on the actually very good sound design for the game mechanics.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Jammin’ Jars is played on an eight by eight cascade-style grid. It offers quite a unique gameplay, which is different than what you might be used to from most popular slots.</p>
<p>Hitting 3 Jars symbols gives you the free spins bonus</p>
<p>On each spin, stacked tiles fall in from the top and are then removed from the game when they are part of a winning combination. This allows a cascade mechanism to kick in, bringing down more tiles from above to fill the empty spaces left by your win. If the new tiles trigger another win it all goes into your pile of winnings for that spin.</p>
<p>Accompanying this are a few well-designed features that complement the theme of the game and are nice variations on the usual set of features you might expect from a slot.</p>
<p>Variety is the spice of life, and it is nice to see games like Jammin’ Jars innovating with the slot machine format a bit.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are three bonus features.</p>
<p>The first is the Wild jam jar symbol which falls at random.</p>
<p>The jar also gains a multiplier each time it is part of a win. The second win with a given Wild symbol results in a double payout, the third in a triple and so on. The jar remains in place during the cascade.</p>
<p>If you are lucky you can win big when more Jar symbols show up and raise the multiplier after each winning</p>
<p>If you manage to land three Wild symbols in one spin (this includes any cascades you trigger) then you trigger the free spins bonus.</p>
<p>During free spins, when a Wild is part of a win it moves at random into an empty space left by the win before the cascade falls. The jar, once moved, remains in place during the cascade. During the next spin, it then moves to another adjacent space.</p>
<p>The result of combining multiple Wilds with cascades and constantly increasing multipliers mean that this bonus can result in absolutely massive wins if it goes well.</p>
<p>The third feature can be triggered when you win nothing on a spin. In this case, the game could add a random number of giant symbols all of the same kind but of varying sizes to the board. These act like every square they cover is one of the same fruit as the giant symbol.</p>
<p>No-win spin can turn into a winning one by chance with a special feature of Jammin' Jars</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The RTP for this game is a decent 96.83%. This is a little over the average of around 96%.</p>
<p>Wins tend to be very small from just combos of fruit. The big wins come from hitting the bonus features. As a result, the game can be quite high variance, a fact to bear in mind when working out your plan for bet sizing.</p>
<p>Full paytable of Jammin' Jars slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Jammin’ Jars is a fun, fast-paced ride that is worth getting on just for the novelty of it.</p>
<p>The variance means there can be long periods of not much happening but when it comes to life, Jammin’ Jars is a ton of fun and with a decent RTP to go with it, this is a slot we can really recommend.</p>
