<p>The United States’ top stock car racing organization – NASCAR – has increased the number of total races for the 2021 season and added a dirt track.</p>
<p>NASCAR Revamps 20210 Racing Schedule</p>
<p>NASCAR – the US-based stock car racing organization – is preparing for a big shake-up of its 2021 Cup Series season. The new schedule will focus on road racing and add six races on road courses, fewer oval tracks, and a dirt race.</p>
<p>It’s the first time since 1970 that the NASCAR circuit will test drivers in a dirt track. And, while some have been worried about declining interest in NASCAR viewership, the organization has pushed the number of races to 36, the highest number in the past 40 years.</p>
<p>NASCAR is adding the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, which will be a first for the circuit in this format. Road America has been a popular Xfinity series pit stop, but it’s now shifting to a more permanent part of the family.</p>
<p>Another debutant is none other than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, which has also been hosting mostly Xfinity races, but is now making a shift to NASCAR. Nashville Superspeedway will now be part of the circuit, a big shift from its third-tier Gander Truck design.</p>
<p>The big question is which track will become a dirt track? NASCAR has chosen to go with Bristol Motor Speedway, which will put all drivers to a challenge they have not quite experienced as part of a competitive season.</p>
<p>Darlington Raceway and Atlanta Motor Speedway will also host one event each and the traditional All-Star Race will now have to shift to Texas Motor Speedway. Yet, tradition is important for NASCAR, and Daytona will once again be the opening race.</p>
<p>However, with the worthwhile new additions, NASCAR had to think about dropping a few gems. Such are the races that take place at Chicagoland Speedway and Kentucky Speedway, which will be no more.</p>
