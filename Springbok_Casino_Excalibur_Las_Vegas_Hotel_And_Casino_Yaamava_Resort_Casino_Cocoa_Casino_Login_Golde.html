<p>The leading online casino and sports betting company in the US, Rush Street Interactive (RSI), announced that it added its online sportsbook services to BetRivers for customers in West Virginia. It was back in April last year when RSI first launched its online casino in the state under the brand BetRivers.</p>
<p>Now, the brand will offer a complete array of entertainment including online casino and sportsbook for customers from the Mountain State. The recent launch enables bettors, aged 21 and over to place a secure bet via BetRivers' mobile app available for Android and iOS. Sports bettors can also place bets online. Seeking to increase the convenience for its customer base, RSI is supporting the same wallet for the online casino and sportsbook.</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, RSI's CEO, commented in a press release on June 7, 2022. He said: "We are excited to expand our presence in West Virginia and offer residents more ways to win with the launch of our popular BetRivers sportsbook."</p>
<p>Schwartz acknowledged that RSI has experience in offering online sportsbook and online casino services. He pointed out that the company is "constantly striving to provide a more trusted betting experience by emphasizing usability, responsibility, and transparency."</p>
<p>Speaking about the market in West Virginia, Schwartz predicted that RSI's sportsbook will be well received by the players. He outlined that residents of the state are already familiar with the brand BetRivers and its high-quality products and customer service.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Schwartz said: "We are pleased that our integrated app will provide one convenient location for players in West Virginia to switch effortlessly between the casino and sportsbook using phones, tablets and computers to experience all that we have to offer, from spreads, money lines, parlays, single-game parlays, and player props to slots, tables games, and live dealer experiences."</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent launch, West Virginia customers can now access BetRivers' sportsbook features that offer high speed and reliability. Bettors in the state can place both pre-game and in-play bets on different sports leagues.</p>
<p>Additionally, BetRivers offers special bonuses and a unique loyalty program called "Refer a Friend." Customers who are interested in the loyalty program and refer a friend to sign up receive a special scratch card that gives them a guaranteed payout between $50 and $500.</p>
<p>Just like its online casino operations, RSI's entry into the online sports betting market of West Virginia was facilitated via a partnership with Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort.</p>
<p>By now, RSI offers real-money mobile and online services in more than a dozen US states. Besides the US, RSI also operates in the regulated markets of Ontario, Canada and Colombia.</p>
