    <h1>Wind Creek Online Casino Pa Casino Near Me Open Now Lincoln City Oregon Casino Stratosphere Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>CasinoIn used a breach of ethics method by declining my withdrawals for over a week in hope I will wager and lose my balance.</p>
<p>I have attempted to make 16 individual withdrawals between July 17 2023 and July 27 2023. All were denied.</p>
<p>I have contacted live chat support as well as emailed support a dozen times, and always got the same bogus excuse: "There is an issue with our payment system. We will keep you updated soon"</p>
<p>FACT: They did not have issues with their payment system. This is clearly a shady practice they use to delay withdrawals hoping that the player loses their balance. In fact, they even increased my bet limits without my ask on the game I play the most: Roulette.</p>
<p>I have tried making withdrawals for 10 days in a row. On Day 10, I played and lost my entire balance of $31,500. Surprisingly (sarcastic), I received an email on day 11 saying the payment system is now working.</p>
<p>I have contacted Casinoin directly and explained them the situation, asking for compensation of the money lost caused by their declined withdrawals with no basis. They have not replied.</p>
<p>I look forward in receiving Casino Guru's help to solve the matter.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
