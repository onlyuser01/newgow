<p>Today I want to explain my case</p>
<p>Today I want to explain my case. Unhappy with the resolution after having invested more than 9000 euros in this casino and being a celebrity.</p>
<p>I have won 50 euros in free spins and I have said then I withdraw and I indulge myself. It is always exciting to win but here comes the downturn. I request by chat to a celebrity agent that I do not want the withdrawal on a registered card because in that bank for my reasons I have it blocked and I request on which card I want the withdrawal. The agent asks me where I want it and that when I make the withdrawal I will notify him again. So I proceed and the agent tells me that the note passes.</p>
<p>Hours later I receive the withdrawal in the account that I had already alerted that I did not want. I complain to the casino and their response is sorry and in a few words you screw up because they do not give me any solution. I am very angry. Because it's only 50 euros. If there are 2,000, what do I do, go to court?</p>
<p>It seems surreal to me that a casino that pockets thousands of euros a month from these types of resolutions when they are not going for 50 euros and many of us, yes, the truth. Unfortunate so be careful where you do the withdrawals and very well assured that you have canceled the cards where you do not want them. Then they wash their hands and fuck the user. Danifr14</p>
