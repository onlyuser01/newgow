    <h1>Yebo Casino 4 Winds Casino New Buffalo Santa Ana Hotel And Casino Caesars Palace Las Vegas Hotel Cas</h1>

<p>King Billy Casino is one of the shortlisted candidates for the Casino Guru Awards in the Fairest General T&amp;C’s and the Most Effective Handling of Complaints category. We have sat down with the King Billy Casino for a quick catch up to get a better feeling of how they handle complaints and ensure overall fairness. Here is our interview with them.</p>
<p>Q: King Billy Casino, it’s good to see you return to the Casino Guru Awards. Let’s start you off with a hard one – what do you think makes you the best pick in the Most Effective Handling of Complaints category?</p>
<p>It is, indeed, a hard one, given the level of the competition! We like to think that we have a good chance to win, based on a couple of numbers. First of all, we take pride in our overall handling of complaints, with our spotless 83/83 resolved Casino Guru complaints over the several years of our collaboration. Second, to our knowledge, we may be the only casino to reinstate €80.000 winnings from a No Deposit Bonus (while it was within our right to decline) after an extensive and earnest dialogue with Casino Guru.</p>
<p>Q: Can you give us examples of things that your handling of the complaints process does better than that of competitors?</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, we do not monitor the way our competitors handle complaints. We have had several examples of players telling us that we have handled their complaint much better than this or that casino, which probably shows that we are, indeed, doing something better.</p>
<p>Q: Do you study competitors to improve your own processes, or do you rely on your judgement in resolving complaints solely?</p>
<p>In Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, there is a passage, which says that all happy families are alike, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Well, the same applies to complaints. Not two players and not two complaints are the same. So, we treat each case as unique and we rely entirely on our judgement to resolve it, satisfactorily, for fall.</p>
<p>Q: How is the process of complaint resolution different now and let’s say five years ago?</p>
<p>The proliferation of complaint platforms has led to a complaints boom, which is of course, positive for the player, in the sense that they will find justice. However, on the other hand, we are seeing a system overuse. If 1000 rupees, which is about 10 Euros, were not transferred within, let’s say, ten minutes to your account, it makes no sense to publish a complaint.</p>
<p>Q: What is the greatest challenge that remains to date for your team when solving complaints?</p>
<p>Without a doubt, fraud detection. Unfortunately, there is a very, very, small minority of people (we would not call them players) who try to abuse every system they can. Legitimacy of complaints is still our greatest challenge.</p>
<p>Q: Has the Casino Guru Awards made you more aware of the importance of maintaining a strong complaint handling process and have you been inspired to introduce changes to how you address this process?</p>
<p>To be honest, it is our relationship with Casino Guru, which has enormously helped us in better handling of complaints and introducing changes in handling them. The Casino Guru Awards come as a culmination of this unique relationship.</p>
<p>Q: What has motivated you to sign up for the format, and what do you hope to gain as a result of your participation and potentially winning the awards?</p>
<p>Well, we have always had a severe case of "Awardaphilia". During our 7 years of operations, we have amassed 28 awards, shortlists and distinctions, and we are always hungry for more. That’s the spirit of King Billy!</p>
