<p>Inter Miami vs. Sporting Kansas City is a 2023 MLS game that will take place at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, FL, on Saturday, September 9</p>
<p>Inter Miami is coming off a huge win over the reigning MLS champion Los Angeles FC, but the Herons are still far behind the MLS Playoff zone. To get into the top 9 in the Eastern Conference, they need to keep on winning. Thatâ€™s why beating Sporting Kansas City on Saturday, September 9, 2023, is a must for Lionel Messi &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Sporting KC Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Inter Miami +114 Draw +300 Sporting Kansas City +179</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 3 -175 Under 3 +135</p>

<p>Inter Miami Needs to Continue Winning in the MLS</p>
<p>Inter Miami is without a loss since Lionel Messi joined the club. They won the 2023 Leagues Cup and are 1-1-0 in the MLS in the Messi era. However, theyâ€™re still eight points behind the closest team from the playoff zone (DC United).</p>

<p>The good news for the Herons is that theyâ€™ve played two or more games fewer than all the teams currently sitting above them in the Eastern Conference standings. What this practically means is that they just need to continue winning to get to the top 9.</p>
<p>So, the big question is whether they can keep on winning. With Messi on the pitch, they look capable of beating any opponent in North America. However, there are some questions about the fitness of the 36-year-old. On the bright side, heâ€™ll have had almost an entire week to prepare for the Sporting KC game.</p>
<p>Sporting Kansas City Is Horrible on the Road</p>
<p>A thing thatâ€™s making Sporting KC players optimistic about their trip to Florida is that theyâ€™re in top shape since the resumption of the 2023 MLS. Theyâ€™re coming off two straight wins. First, they defeated the San Jose Earthquakes 3-0; then, they beat St. Louis City 2-1. Whatâ€™s interesting is that both of those games took place in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Sporting KC is 8-8-11 overall, but these guys are horrible on the road. Their away record in the 2023 MLS is 1-6-1. Plus, the last time the boys from Kansas City won an MLS game away from their home was on May 7, when they defeated the Seattle Sounders 2-1 in Washington State. The problem is that the Sounders arenâ€™t great on their turf, at least not as Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Sporting KC Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miami has the motivation, as well as the manpower to win Saturdayâ€™s game. Plus, considering that itâ€™s played on their turf, the Herons will also have their fans to cheer them on. Thatâ€™s why anything but a convincing win for Inter Miami would be a huge surprise in our eyes.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
