<p>The appointment complements the growth of the company's C-suite and Cruz brings more than two decades of experience</p>
<p>The leading sportsbook and casino platform provider, Digitain, announced Wednesday a new senior-level hire. The company confirmed that it strengthened its C-suite with the addition of Margarita Cruz, an experienced executive. Joining Digitain’s management team, she was appointed to the role of senior sales director.</p>
<p>The recent hire marks a strategic move for the company, given that Cruz brings more than two decades of experience. She has a track record after holding senior commercial and sales roles with companies operating in North and Latin America, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>As a part of Digitain companies’ senior leadership team, Cruz will leverage her experience and provide strategic guidance. Accumulating significant knowledge of sales strategies and international operations is going to help Digitain’s new senior sales director as she will oversee key processes related to the company’s growth and expansion. Moreover, Cruz has a deep understanding of the B2C and B2B iGaming verticals, which makes her a perfect addition to the growing team of experts at Digitain.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company selected the seasoned gaming executive, Grigor Asoyan, for the role of group deputy CEO of technology. The appointment dates back to April, marking a strategic hire for Digitain.</p>
<p>More recently, the company expanded its C-suite with the addition of Martin Martirosyan. Last month, Digitain hired the services of Martirosyan who was appointed as deputy CEO. He brought a unique experience to Digitain after being a part of major companies in the banking sector.</p>
