<p>Casino software developer and supplier Yggdrasil has announced the upcoming Splitz mechanic which will introduce over 200,000 paylines in future slot machine games. The first product to include the mechanic is Temple Stacks: Splitz which will arrive early in 2020.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Announces the Splitz Mechanic</p>
<p>Leading iGaming software provider Yggdrasil has pioneered the Splitz mechanic, a gameplay feature where each symbol holds an ‘infinite potential’. The company will pioneer the mechanic as early as January, 2020, hoping to achieve better player engagement and retention rate, Yggdrasil said in the official statement.</p>
<p>Splitz will revolve around the use of mystery symbols dropping into the reels and then splitting into multiple other symbols, all of this accompanied by flashy graphics and zappy tunes.</p>

<p>A total of 12 symbols can hit the reels for each available stack, boosting the theoretical return-to-player (RTP) rate for players significantly. Yggdrasil Head of Slots, Natalya Ovchinnikova, expressed her delight with the new mechanic, confirming the company’s commitment to innovation.</p>
<p>The games can feature up to over 200,000 paylines, turning many of Yggdrasil’s future games into a form of ‘Megaways slots’ developed by Blueprint Gaming and Big Time Gaming. The Splitz engine will create hundreds of thousands of possible payouts as well.</p>
<p>First Splitz Slot Name Announced</p>
<p>Yggdrasil is already working on a title incorporating the newly-released feature. Temple Stacks: Splitz will become the first game to include the mechanic and introduce it to a wider audience.</p>
<p>The game is advertised as an Aztec-themed adventure where players will get access to the whopping 248,000 paylines along with a total payout equal to 25,000x of the original stake of the player.</p>
<p>In pure theoretical returns, Yggdrasil has listed the RTP as 96.1% and medium-to-high variance, striking a balance between big payouts and the frequency of these payouts.</p>
<p>Just Days from the Big ADVENTures</p>
<p>Apart from Splitz, Yggdrasil is preparing to release a series of special promotions worth €300,000 ($333,820) to players. The Christmas special will run from December 16 through January 12, offering players an opportunity to land solid rewards. Subdivided into multiple tempting treats, Yggdrasil is offering players various promos, including:</p>
<p>‘Tis the Season where players can try their luck at popular Yggdrasil titles, such as Vikings Go Wild, Trolls Bridge, and others</p>

<p>Yggdrasil recently appointed former NetEnt COO Björn Krantz as head of the supplier’s global publishing and licensing business. Krantz and Yggdrasil CEO Fredrik Elmqvist have had a heart-to-heart outlining the company’s strategy to boost the B2B segment and keep adding new clients well in 2020.</p>
<p>Previously, Yggdrasil has launched a number of games that have been immediate success. Back in October, the company launched Lilith’s Inferno, a beautifully-animated game received well by fans.</p>
