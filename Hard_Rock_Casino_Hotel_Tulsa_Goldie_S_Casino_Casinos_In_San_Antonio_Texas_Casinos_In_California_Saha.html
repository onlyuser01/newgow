<p>No, it's not like that in Austria - once the spin is done you can press again. But there are also other laws. For example, you're not allowed to win more than 10,000 euros per spin. But you can still play for 10 euros.</p>
<p>Gambling and automatic spins have been banned. After 2 hours you have to take a 15 or 30 minute break. You can only play with us if you are registered.</p>
<p>Registration, then you get a card that you have to insert into the machine, then you can pay money onto the card, then you can play. After 2 hours, the system says a break of 15 or 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It's all good, I think - only the 10,000 euro I find a rip-off. As said, you have to press each spin extra.</p>
<p>Example - you play Book of Ra 10 euros per push. You get a free spin with the explorer. What happens now? The free spins start when you press it, and all free spins expire automatically. Weird even though it's automatically banned. As long as you are in free spins, all free spins count as 1 pusher.</p>
<p>So far so good - now comes the clou for the casino operators! If you get several extensions of the free spins and suddenly have a full picture with the researcher, that would be 50,000 euros. Now the system says - you only get 10-000 euros and all other free spins are gone because the whole thing only counts as a pusher.</p>
<p>Respect for so much mendacity in the system-again, work is only done for operators such as Novomatic and consorts.</p>
