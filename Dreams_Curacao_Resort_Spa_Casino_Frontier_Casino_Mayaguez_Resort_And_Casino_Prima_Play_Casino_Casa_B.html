<p>Dear Guru,</p>
<p>I am writing to report a deeply concerning issue I have encountered while attempting to withdraw funds from my account at Slots Gallery Casino. Despite successfully completing the verification process and providing all necessary documentation, the casino has continuously refused to process my withdrawals. I am reaching out to you, as I registered with Slots Gallery Casino using your platform, in the hopes that you can intervene and assist in resolving this matter promptly.</p>
<p>As evidence of my fully verified status, I have attached a screenshot of a conversation with a customer support representative from Slots Gallery Casino. In this exchange, the representative explicitly acknowledges that my account has been fully verified and reassures me to proceed with another withdrawal. However, to my utter dismay, the casino has since failed to honor their own commitment and has resorted to evasive tactics, takimg away ny verification and ask only for electricity bills and utility bills which i can not provide and denying my withdrawal requests without providing any valid reason. The bank statement and tax documents were enough amd was verified.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a tactic by the casino but It appears that Slots Gallery Casino is intentionally avoiding paying out. I implore you to investigate this matter thoroughly and intervene on my behalf to ensure the casino fulfills its obligations and honors their promise to process my withdrawals.</p>
<p>I have followed all the necessary steps and provided all required documents during the verification process. I am left feeling frustrated, deceived, and concerned about the legitimacy and integrity of Slots Gallery Casino. I believe that your intervention can help rectify this situation, hold the casino accountable for their actions, and facilitate the release of my funds.</p>
<p>I kindly request that you reach out to Slots Gallery Casino on my behalf, urgently addressing the unprocessed withdrawal despite my verification being completed and all requirements fulfilled, they removed my verification it appears that there is an attempt to delay or avoid the payment altogether. ( I will attach the screenshots )</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I sincerely hope that you can help me navigate this distressing situation swiftly and efficiently. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information</p>
