    <h1>Ocean City Maryland Casino Casino In Georgia Hotels Near Rocky Gap Casino Desert Diamond Casino Glen</h1>

<p>Dear Inmerion Casino,</p>
<p>After examining your website, it is clear that you present yourself as an anonymous casino, with no need to provide any personal information or KYC procedure. Yet, in your terms and conditions, you have a list of restricted countries and also a note that you can request a player to complete the KYC procedure anytime. We have discovered that if a player registers in your casino from such a restricted country, there is no IP block to prevent him from registering, no popup, and no message or warning. The player can register and play in your casino freely.</p>
<p>If a casino wants to prevent players from certain countries from playing in your casino, it should not allow them to register in the first place, and it should enforce this on a software level. The amount of players who read all the terms and conditions is minimal.</p>
<p>Whenever someone from a restricted country registers, these casinos allow them to create an account, but only let them know about the restriction when they want to make a withdrawal. As long as a player is losing, the casino is OK with it, but as soon as the player wins and wants to withdraw money, they use the 'restricted countries' rule to decline the withdrawal and block the player's account. If a player can access the casino's website, open the registration form, create an account, deposit, and play, it's understandable that they assume that they are allowed to play at this casino.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player even though they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules.</p>
