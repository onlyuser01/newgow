<p>Bulletproof Games has become the latest partner of Yggdrasil’s YG Masters and will access the operator’s GATI technology and proprietary mechanics.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s GigaBlox and MultiMax Mechanics</p>
<p>Yggdrasil proves to be one of the best companies on the iGaming market, as one more studio chose to join its YG Masters program. UK-based Bulletproof Games is the latest developer to become a YG partner and will access Yggdrasil’s proprietary GATI technology and mechanics.</p>
<p>This collaboration with YG Masters will allow the studio to create and deploy premium content over Yggdrasil’s vast network. In addition to GATI, Bulletproof Games will now be able to incorporate the operator’s very own mechanics, the popular GigaBlox and MultiMax, into its own titles. Yggdrasil and Bulletproof Games’ partnership will take the industry to new heights, with fresh, fun, and unique games.</p>
<p>Like all other YG Masters partners, Bulletproof Games will benefit from Yggdrasil’s revolutionary GATI (Game Adaptation Tools &amp; Interface) technology, a regulation-ready standardized toolkit allowing developers to distribute their products quickly over Yggdrasil’s entire network. This includes the operator’s collaborators located in various jurisdictions across the world. GATI gives studios the opportunity to grow quickly by increasing their reach and the quality of their games.</p>
<p>“Fantastic Studio”</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Bulletproof Games is led by an experienced team of game developers and already features an impressive portfolio full of entertaining and unique slot titles such as Tiki Runner, The Black Lotus, Dragon Lore, and Blackbeard.</p>
<p>“Bulletproof Games is a fantastic studio which is operated by a team with immense industry experience,” Stuart McCarthy, Head of Partner Programs at Yggdrasil, noted today. Joining YG Masters will allow the game provider to take its content “to the next level“, he added. McCarthy commended the partnership and said that Yggdrasil is excited about what the British studio will release first.</p>
<p>According to Bulletproof Games’ Chief Product Officer, Mike Bullock, the company believes in giving its players a “deeply captivating and entertaining experience” and said that the collaboration with YG Masters will allow them to “introduce unique content and rapidly grow”.</p>
