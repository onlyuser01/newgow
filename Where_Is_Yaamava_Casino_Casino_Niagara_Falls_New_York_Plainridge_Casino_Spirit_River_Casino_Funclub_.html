    <h1>Where Is Yaamava Casino Casino Niagara Falls New York Plainridge Casino Spirit River Casino Funclub</h1>

<p>Evolution continues to make waves in the regulated Live Casino iGaming market in New Jersey with the company introduce a brand new game locally</p>
<p>Enter Crazy Time, the award-winning game show by the company, which is now available in the Garden State and will bring a bit of Evolution magic to the local gaming scene. The title has already made its mark on Europe and is now going to try and steal audiences away from similar formats in the live casino vertical in the United States. Or rather compel players to examine the exciting format.</p>
<p>Growing Evolution’s Signature Portfolio with New Releases</p>
<p>The iGaming sector in the country has been expanding rapidly of late, and with this, there has been demand for more game shows and concepts that defy the traditional experience. Crazy Time is more or less based on titles such as The Price is Right and Wheel of Fortune.</p>
<p>What makes the game so fun and special is Evolution’s decision to layer it on with multiple smaller bonus games that will trigger Cash Hunt, Pachinko, Crazy Time Wheel Bonus, and Coin Flip, or essentially, it’s a game within a game, within a game, and so on.</p>
<p>The wheel also features a 25x multiplier which can really up the ante and add to the fun. Plus, there is a chance to win 10,000x the size of the player’s bet, which can quickly result in a massive payday.</p>
<p>As Evolution is already present on the market in New Jersey, there is no shortage of brands that will benefit from this title, including Caesars Palace Online Casino, BetRivers, DraftKings Casino, BetMGM Casino, and more.</p>
<p>Building a Strong Proposition with Crazy Time and High Production Values</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch in the market, Evolution America CEO Jacob Claesson argued that the game show was a particularly distinct product that marked a brand new chapter for the company. He explained:</p>
<p>Across the world, operators and players alike have praised Crazy Time’s incredibly high production values, its commitment to entertainment and depth of engagement, and the sheer fun and enjoyment it offers players. Evolution America CEO Jacob Claesson</p>
<p>Of course, Evolution is also planning smartly ahead as the company knows that the six iGaming states status-quo is unlikely to remain intact for much longer. In the wake of rapid sports gambling legislation, more lawmakers are becoming open to the idea of expanding into online gambling, as it would allow states to generate extra coin for their coffers.</p>
<p>Evolution recently expanded in West Virginia through a partnership with BetRivers, and the company is looking to deliver more excellent experiences in North America, as it strengthens local footprints.</p>
