<p>Inspired Entertainment and Churchill Dows Racetrack may have kept the lid on the Kentucky Derby for a while, but the companies have some good news – the event will be back on May 2 from 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. EDT and broadcast on NBC.</p>
<p>One minor detail, however, is that the first of the Triple Crown events will be a computer-simulated version of the real race, or virtual sports as they have become famous. The real event has been pushed back to September unfortunately.</p>
<p>Join us May 2nd for a Virtual #KyDerbyAtHome Party featuring the Triple Crown Showdown where the 13 Triple Crown winners will race one another in a computer simulation under the historic Twin Spires of Churchill Downs.</p>

<p>“The Kentucky Derby: Triple Crown Showdown” will offer an opportunity to horse racing fans to not miss on one of the milestones in horse racing, Inspired said on Friday.</p>
<p>Fans will enjoy photorealistic graphics, courtesy of Inspired’s ultra-realistic 3D CGI which will pit 13 historic Triple Crown victors from the past century in the ultimate race. This one is a Kentucky Derby that even Jody Demling himself couldn’t predict successfully.</p>
<p>The software has recreated the Twin Spires at Churchill Downs to the T, including the ambiance of the Derby Day.</p>
<p>When and Where to Watch the Virtual Kentucky Derby?</p>
<p>Date : May 2</p>
<p>: May 2 Time : 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. EDT</p>
<p>: 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. EDT TV: NBC</p>
<p>Looking at History</p>
<p>To put together a competitive list of horses, the software utilizes all available historic information about the shortlisted horses. Based on that information, Inspired’s solution will try to determine the most probable outcome for each participant.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Inspired President and Chief Operating Officer Brooks Pierce said that the company was excited to move this project forward. He similarly shared his enthusiasm to help the Kentucky Derby take place even if in another form.</p>
<p>“Churchill Downs is the world’s most legendary racetrack and the Kentucky Derby is the premier event in horse racing. We are honored to be a part of this special tradition and support Churchill Downs in this endeavor, as we work together to help fill the gap of live sports and bring people together for some relief during these difficult times.”</p>
<p>Fans will still be able to use the race’s official race. Meanwhile, both Churchill Downs and the Churchill Downs Foundation will make a donation. CDF will contribute $1 million towards the COVID-19 relief efforts.</p>
<p>Responding to the latest developments, Churchill Downs Racetrack president Kevin Flannery promised realistic graphics that will captivate the fans. Flannery also said that the company is happy to provide fans with a form of entertainment while contributing its own fair share in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Inspired Takes Care of Some of the Most Important Virtual Sports</p>
<p>Inspired is no amateur in creating on-point virtual sports races. Previously, the company set up the Virtual Grand National, offering some very accurate predictions of which horses are the most likely to qualify in the real world Grand National event.</p>
<p>In fact, the Grand National earlier this month pulled in some 4.8 million viewers, marking headlines and offering some relief for fans who didn’t get to enjoy the real event.</p>
<p>Pierce also commented that virtual sports has proven a palliative for fans to stay tuned to the sports they love. Simulations in multiple disciplines, not just horse racing, has helped sportsbooks stay afloat, and even diversify their revenue streams. Inspired offers 14 virtual races all of which can be easily integrated into the sportsbook.</p>
