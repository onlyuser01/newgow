<p>Grosvenor’s Merchant City Casino is getting a facelift which will cost the owner £3.5 million ($4.3 million) to refurbish the property. The Rank Group is looking to elevate the on-site experience of the Glasgow property by shaping it into what it calls will be a “world-class entertainment hub.”</p>
<p>Grosvenor to Refurbish Its Merchant City Property</p>
<p>Already topping the group’s performance scores, the Merchant City Casino is an important asset for the Grosvenor brand. The refurbishment will have to do with updating and upgrading the look and experience, turning the existing premises into a more modernistic interpretation of gaming. Still, Grosvenor will seek to preserve its authenticity and appeal to existing clientele.</p>
<p>Not all refurbishment details will be rushed out to the public, with a series of official meets &amp; greets gently revealing the future of the property. The first of these events is due on June 30 and will lay bare plans for a new restaurant and bar, an interior redesign, and get down to brass tacks with new menus as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on all these exciting and pending changes, Grosvenor Casino Merchant City general manager Debbie Johnston said:</p>
<p>Glasgow’s hospitality sector was hard hit during the pandemic, but Grosvenor Casino’s major investment in Merchant City shows there is real confidence in the city’s recovery. Grosvenor Casino Merchant City general manager Debbie Johnston</p>
<p>If food &amp; beverage is important so are the gaming floors which will be getting their fair share of the action. To get started, Grosvenor plans to introduce brand-new table games, install wall screens and focus on serving guests and players with what it describes as a premium area to enjoy sports, mixing the two gambling verticals together and gently padding them with the added fun from socializing and hobnobbing with other sports fans and gamblers.</p>
<p>New Sports Experiences, Jobs, and Tastes</p>
<p>While some properties have decided to batten down the hatches and cut down on expenses, Grosvenor believes that the refurbishment plan is what will ultimately help the property attract new and loyal customers, reenergize dormant ones, and generally continue to improve in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The venue expects the nightlife clientele to start turning up during and after the project is complete. Not only that but the property is looking forward to stimulating the economy and creating new jobs. At least 13 new positions should be created.</p>
<p>It’s all about getting the Grosvenor’s plan right, though. According to Johnston, visitors will have the opportunity to get a trifecta of fun experiences, including gaming, dining, and sports in a “vibrant atmosphere.” An official event is also scheduled for July 2. All of this and more in the company of fellow entertainers and a delectable selection of foods and drinks. More details will be forthcoming by the company.</p>
