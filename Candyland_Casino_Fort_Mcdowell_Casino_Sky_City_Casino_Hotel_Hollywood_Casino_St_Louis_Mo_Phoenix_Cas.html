<p>The award-winning iGaming platform and sportsbook solutions provider, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced it received a supplier license for the regulated market in Ontario, Canada. The announcement came Thursday and allows the company to now join forces with operators that offer services in the Canadian province.</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), which is the gambling regulator in the province, awarded GiG its license. Thanks to that, the company can now roll out its player account management (PAM) platform as well as its award-winning business-to-business sportsbook solution.</p>
<p>Claudio Caruana, GIG's general counsel, commented in a press release by saying: "In receiving the registration from the AGCO, we have reached another important milestone in our resolute commitment to supporting the iGaming industry for regulated markets, and we're delighted to be prepared to power new and potential partners in the province."</p>
<p>It was back in April this year when Ontario opened its legal online gambling market. While major industry giants have already secured access to the regulated market in the province, still, GiG acknowledged that the "registration marks an early entry." In that line of thought, the company cited H2 Gambling Data, which predicts the market in Ontario to grow to $2.02bn (â‚¬2bn) in gross gaming revenue (GGR) in the next three years.</p>
<p>The recent license by the AGCO reaffirms GiG's ongoing expansion. By now, the company has entered 22 regulated jurisdictions and it is expecting to receive approval for another four. With its market entry in Ontario, GiG said it is looking to become the go-to "technical supplier of choice" for online operators.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GiG expanded its reach in Spain, by joining forces with a new operator. Under the three-year agreement, the company agreed to provide its platform to power the online operations of an already well-established retail operator in the region. This marked another successful partnership for GiG which helped the company grow its presence in the region. Overall, the company has thirteen partnerships in Spain.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the new partnership in Spain, GiG also unveiled a collaboration with Caravel Entertainment Limited, a company that operates the famous "Moosh" brand in Portugal. As a result, GiG agreed to provide its platform and award-winning sportsbook for Caravel, further strengthening the company's growth strategy in the region.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, GiG revealed that the partnership with Caravel is for three years. However, the company did not rule out further extension of the collaboration for a longer period.</p>
