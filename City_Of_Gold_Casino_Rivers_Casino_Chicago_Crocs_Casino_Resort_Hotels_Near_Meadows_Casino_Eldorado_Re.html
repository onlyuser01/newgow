<p>Players will have a chance to win their way to the £3,300 WSOP Super Circuit Series London Main Event and the £21,200 Triton Super High Roller GGMillion$ Live</p>
<p>The world’s biggest online poker room, GGPoker, announced the launch of a series of online poker tournaments providing pathways for players to participate in live poker events in London.</p>
<p>Pathways to Live Poker Events</p>
<p>The Road to London series of satellites launched by GGPoker will offer participants a chance to win seats for two iconic live poker tournaments, the £3,300 WSOP Super Circuit Series London Main Event and the £21,200 Triton Super High Roller GGMillion$ Live, as well as the thrill of live poker action.</p>
<p>Commenting on the series launch, GGPoker’s head of marketing, UK &amp; Ireland, Angela Martin, was thrilled to announce the return of live poker events to London, adamant that Road to London would be “an unrivaled opportunity to participate in world-class tournaments and compete alongside the poker elite.”</p>
<p>We’re confident that GGPoker players will relish the chance to win their way into these incredible live events at a fraction of the cost, making poker dreams come true. Angela Martin, head of marketing for UK &amp; Ireland, GGPoker</p>
<p>Promising an electrifying experience for poker players, as well as the thrill of competitive live poker action on an international stage, the Road to London series will reward at least 200 players with seats to the WSOP Super Circuit London Main Event.</p>
<p>One More Hurdle to Overcome</p>
<p>Players who have earned their seats through the satellites will be free to participate in either an OnLive Day 1 tournament hosted at GGPoker or in one of three live Day 1s in London. The first OnLive Day 1 tournament is set to take place on July 2 and step qualifiers are already underway.</p>
<p>Scheduled to start on August 8, the £3,300 WSOP Super Circuit Series London Main Event will have a huge guaranteed prize pool of £3,000,000 ($3,840,000), besides the thrill of playing competitive poker with fellow players from around the world, including recent GGPoker partner, Brian ‘True Geordie’ Davis.</p>
<p>Commencing on July 27, the £21,200 Triton Super High Roller GGMillion$ Live will welcome some of the most popular poker players worldwide, promising to make it a truly exhilarating affair. Qualifier satellites for the tournament will run from June 24.</p>
<p>Both the £3,300 WSOP Super Circuit Series London Main Event and the £21,200 Triton Super High Roller GGMillion$ Live will take place at JW Marriott Grosvenor House in the heart of the capital.</p>
<p>GGPoker was at the center of a controversy recently after most of the high stakes players decided to boycott the games in protest of the latest changes to the poker room’s rake system.</p>
