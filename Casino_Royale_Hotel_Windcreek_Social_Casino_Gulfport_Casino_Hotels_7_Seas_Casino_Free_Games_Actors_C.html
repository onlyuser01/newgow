<p>Full Tilt Poker to Expand Casino Game Selection</p>

<p>One could easily be excused for thinking that Full Tilt Poker only offers poker to its players. After all, the word is right there in the site’s name. But in recent months, that’s been changing: just this January, the Full Tilt client has expanded to offer real-money roulette and blackjack to players in the poker room.</p>
<p>Now, those offerings are set to become a much bigger part of the Full Tilt experience. The Rational Group (parent company to both Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars) and online casino game developer Net Entertainment have announced that they are partnering to bring a wide selection of new games to the Full Tilt Poker interface.</p>
<p>“Net Entertainment has some of the best games in the industry and will deliver a lot of value to our business, not least on the mobile platform,” said Rational Group director of casino Sam Hobcraft. “We look forward to working with NetEnt to develop a truly innovative gaming experience for our customers.”</p>
<p>Net Entertainment Offers Slots, Casino Games</p>
<p>Net Entertainment provides software and casino games to numerous online casinos, including notables like Ladbrokes and Bet365. Their selection of games reportedly includes over 150 titles, ranging from table games to slots, video poker and scratch cards. Some of these games offer large progressive jackpots that span across the many casinos that use their software. Perhaps the most notable is Mega Fortune, which has awarded multimillion dollar jackpots on several occasions.</p>
<p>Net Entertainment’s expertise in mobile gaming might be of particular benefit of Full Tilt Poker. At the moment, Full Tilt offers Rush Poker – its fast-fold poker variant – through mobile apps, but does not have any other games natively available for phones or tablets.</p>
<p>This is the second major partnership announced by the Rational Group in order to expand the Full Tilt Poker brand. In January, they announced a deal with Leander Games that would add slot machines and the LeGa gaming platform under the Full Tilt brand name. This has allowed for Full Tilt Poker to develop a different business model than PokerStars, which has remained solely a poker brand.</p>
<p>Move Helps to Expand Reach of Both Companies</p>
<p>For Net Entertainment, the move marks a valuable expansion into the poker marketplace, as Full Tilt is one of the largest online poker rooms in the world – with fellow Rational Group poker brand PokerStars being by far the largest.</p>
<p>“Rational Group runs the largest online poker operation globally and we are very proud and excited about this partnership, which will allow us to be a first mover within their new casino channel venture,” said Björn Krantz of Net Entertainment. “Together with Rational Group, our games portfolio will reach a completely new player base, and we are confident that our games will be well received.”</p>
<p>According to some reports, this may only be the beginning of how Rational Group ultimately expands the Full Tilt brand. There is speculation that the company may be looking to add a sportsbook to its portfolio, and while it’s unclear how that would fit into their corporate structure, Full Tilt increasingly seems like a natural landing for such a product.</p>
