    <h1>River Casino Pittsburgh Pa Niagara Falls Casino Wind Creek Casino Montgomery Alabama Waterfront Cebu</h1>

<p>Hello Сasino guru team, I am facing a problem regarding the withdrawal of my balance on Casino-Z for almost 4 days now and sadly I have to open this complaint because I didn't receive any insight or any help at all and it's getting really unprofessional and frustrating to deal with.</p>
<p>I am a VIP player in this casino. My all-time deposits total about $100,000.</p>
<p>With large withdrawals, sometimes there were problems with withdrawals, transactions were rejected, or withdrawal methods disappeared.</p>
<p>Now back to the situation that happened a week ago.</p>
<p>Once again I made a deposit in this casino, and played different games, I was lucky to get x1000 winnings from the bet amount of 65 dollars. After this win, I played a little more, and after that I started to put requests for withdrawals, usually they are processed quickly, but this time they were constantly rejected, and there was a message that I had to withdraw using the same method that I made deposits. I made deposits in ltc and withdrawn accordingly to ltc wallet. As a result, they didn’t bring me anything and I went to bed, as it was late at night.</p>
<p>The next day, when I logged into my account, I saw that playing in slots became unavailable to me, and all methods of withdrawing funds from my account disappeared.</p>
<p>I contacted my VIP manager, she said that your game session is being checked and a request was sent to the provider. And from January 27 to this day there is no news, they only say that the check has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>I suspect that there is no validation and no request has been sent to the ISP. This is simply a reason not to pay out the player's winnings.</p>
<p>I kindly ask you to help understand this situation, and that this casino provides you with evidence that they really made a request to the provider, and also did not receive any response from him, as they claim.</p>
<p>I no longer have the strength to fight them.</p>
