<p>The New Hampshire Lottery, the regulator in charge of sports betting in the state, revealed that the combined betting handle by retail and mobile sports betting hit $97.2 million in January. Although this result didn’t mark a record, it was still the highest wagering handle reported for the last six months.</p>
<p>More importantly, the $97.2 million in combined sports betting handle translated to $12.3 million in GGR last month. This result, when compared to the $8.3 million reported for the last month of 2022, December, marked a significant increase. Additionally, a year-over-year comparison to the January 2022 result also marked a significant increase of nearly 54%.</p>
<p>Currently, online sports betting operations are taxed at 51% of sports betting revenue, while retail sports betting is subject to a 50% tax in New Hampshire. According to the latest report released by the New Hampshire Lottery, the $12.3 million in GGR resulted in a total of $5.6 million in proceeds for the state in January.</p>
<p>This result also marked an increase considering that a month earlier, in December, the state’s share was only $3.8 million. Similarly to GGR, the $5.6 million in proceeds for the state was the best result in the last six months.</p>
<p>Retail and Mobile Betting GGR Increases</p>
<p>Generally, mobile sports betting brings more proceeds when compared to retail betting activities and New Hampshire is no exception. The $97.2 million in betting handle reported last month breaks down to $75.2 million in mobile betting handle and $21.9 million in retail betting handle.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the GGR for both retail and mobile sports betting marked an increase. Back in December, the retail betting GGR was only $389,635, bringing the state $126,927 in proceeds. In contrast, GGR reported a month later, in January, was $4.3 million, marking the best result for the last six months. The $4.3 million in retail sports betting GGR translated to $1.9 million in proceeds for New Hampshire for January.</p>
<p>Mobile sports betting also enjoyed an outstanding performance last month. In total, the mobile betting handle of $75.2 million resulted in $8 million in GGR. This marked a strong result, considering that GGR has been around the $6 million mark in the last months. The share of New Hampshire from sports betting last month was $3,666,572, which came close to the December result which was $3,682,445.</p>
