    <h1>Casino Us Casino On Line Free Red Hawk Casino Photos W Casino Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayyam Casi</h1>

<p>This place is a scam, do not deposit money..when you deal with a customer service rep named Jay L. He is as dumb and uneducated as I've ever seen, he only knows how to say sorry for your experience like a robot. Cool casinos cannot differentiate the difference between cred and debit. When you want to withdraw your winnings, they will require a signature on a form as requested only if you've deposited via credit card. Then they will deny it and Jay L will say oh there the same thing, as every mind is suppose to assume all cards are the same, though they specifically only ask that if you've used credit that, that's what they require. This company will never stay in contact, they will recieve your documents and no one will identify they recieved them nor will they identify if there are missing properties. When you get denied they will not let you know you have been denied, funds will return to your cool cat account, where as for me my child who plays on my phone thought of the app as another game to play and spend the funds that should have been sent via check. They have my identity and personal information and will admit they haven't recieved anything. Please watch out for this scam this place will do as much as they can to keep you from collecting your winnings. And the guy Jay L is the last idiot you want to deal with because he will play stupid and apologies that theres nuthing they can do. The relation between customer and support is so far, dont count on winning, read the reviews, every platform shows one star. No one has nuthing nice to say about their business practices. They will scam you and steal your identity. Trust when I say you dont want to go through what I did. Lost my winnings, sure whatever, but i never knew what i was missing or that i was even denied till it was too late. Stay away from cool cat.</p>
