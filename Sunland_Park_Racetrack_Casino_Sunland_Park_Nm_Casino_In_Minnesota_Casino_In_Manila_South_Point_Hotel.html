<p>Submission King Charles Oliveira to Retain His Title?</p>
<p>Charles Oliveira is 31-8 in his professional career, with his most recent loss happening back in 2017. Since then, he’s won nine straight fights. His most recent bout saw him getting ahold of the vacant UFC Lightweight Championship belt.</p>
<p>It happened in May when he defeated Michael Chandler by technical knockout, which was his ninth win by this method. Most of Oliveira’s wins happened by submission. His career tally is 19 submission wins while in the UFC, he has 14 submission wins – the promotion record.</p>
<p>The champ is squaring off with a fighter whose specialty is punching, rather than grappling. Should this worry Oliveira? Considering that four of his eight losses happened knockout/technical knockout, the Brazilian fighter needs to be extra cautious on Saturday.</p>
<p>What’s giving him confidence is that he’s already taken down a number of UFC legends famous for their hard punches – Tony Ferguson, Nik Lentz, and others.</p>
<p>Dustin Poirier Wants to Slay Another UFC Giant</p>
<p>Although still in his early thirties, Poirier has been fighting in the UFC for a very long time. In fact, he’s made his promotional debut in 2011. Over the course of 10+ years, he’s fought some real giants of the sport. Some of them he beat, some defeated him.</p>
<p>One of the milestones of his career was set in April 2019 when he became the interim UFC Lightweight champ after beating Max Holloway. Unfortunately for Poirier, his reign didn’t last long. Just five months later, he lost the title to legendary Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
<p>He rebounded in the following fight, beating Dan Hooker in June 2020. Then, the time came for his second fight with Connor McGregor. The Irishman beat him in 2014, but in January, Poirier was the victor. The two then went toe-to-toe again in July and Poirier won once again.</p>
<p>The third fight with McGregor postponed Poirier’s title shot. He was supposed to fight Oliveira for the championship belt but decided to take care of McGregor first. Now that he’s ticked that item off his list, it’s time to fight for the title. Poirier looks ready to become the champ and the way to do it is to beat Oliveira by knockout.</p>
<p>Pick: Dustin Poirier to win by knockout</p>
