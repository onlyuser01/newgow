    <h1>Casinos Off The Strip In Vegas Choctaw Casino Pocola Ok Casino Near Nashville Tn Casino Mania Cherok</h1>

<p>hello it was my 1st deposit in this casino and on August 7th they put back the 30 euros of the deposit in my balance but as the account is closed I asked that they transfer my funds from my balance to my card with which I had made the deposit or by bank transfer but they asked me again for the kyc already approved on July 10 and July 21 as by chance... and so on their link I sent my passport and in step 1 and put my face in a circle in step 2 and today August 10 as by chance... they say the document must not be modified in any way and must be subjected to a good light. so it was the same document of my iphone when kyc were approve july 10 and july 21 the emails that my kyc was already approved on July 10 and July 21 obviously this casino does not want to pay my funds and so I redid this kyc verification today August 10 this time with my identity card instead of my passport but at my opinion they will still find an excuse thank you for being able to help me to oblige them to pay the funds of my balance of my closed account and that they stop finding pretexts as much as my kyc was already checked 2 times and that even 1 time is enough like for example 1xbet but I still agreed to redo the kyc verification on August 7th with modified passport excuse and bad light... and today August 10th with my identity card but I'm sure they will still find an excuse I send you my passport and 2 selfies for my good faith and their message (excuse passport not good light and modified...)and the 2 emails of july 10 and july 21 of my kyc ever approved... (in the 2nd chat with you because it's writed maximum attachment) in other chat here it's really a shame and a scam this casino moreover 3 weeks ago I filed a complaint with curacao egaming but nothing advanced (just received confirmation email that it was sent to them my request) and I also complained to certria@gaminglicences.com and info@gaminglicences.com and complaints@gaminglicences.com playercomplaints@mountberg.biz but here even after an acknowledgment of receipt as if it were ghost...best regards</p>
<p>hello I have just received another email that this time my identity card is not good because they still ask for the photo of the passport which had been refused before with the pretext of bad light and modified? while during the first 2 kyc of July 10 and July 21 it had been approved with this same passport photo each time they find a pretext and you have seen that the photo of emon passport was clearly visible as an attachment here is the screenshoot in french d their email as proof that they are looking for pretexts... thank you for your help best regards</p>
