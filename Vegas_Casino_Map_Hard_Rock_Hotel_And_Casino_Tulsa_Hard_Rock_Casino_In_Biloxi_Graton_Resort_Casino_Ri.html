    <h1>Vegas Casino Map Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Tulsa Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Graton Resort Casino Ri</h1>

<p>Dear Luca8889,</p>
<p>Thank you for your emails and the updates. Although it is a bit strange that the casino was able to process your withdrawals of 3,000 â‚¬ in one week, in accordance with its rules regarding VIP levels and limits in question, while it was not possible in another week, I am afraid there is no other option than to stay patient and continue requesting withdrawals as it has been done until now.</p>
<p>However, I dare to disagree with your claim that the problem is not the withdrawal methods. The casino informed us that the processing times of transactions made via bank transfer could cause delays, and why.</p>
<p>If 1 bank transfer takes a few business days to be completely processed by the casino, using another available alternative payment method could shorten the processing times per transaction = faster withdrawal. In addition, it also depends on the casino's payment provider(s)/processor(s) since it is common that the payments are not processed exclusively by online casinos, and they cannot influence the withdrawal process once they approve the withdrawals. Then, the process may be taken over by 3rd party.</p>
<p>We usually recommend players wait at least 14 days after requesting a withdrawal prior to submitting a complaint about a delayed withdrawal. In this case, it looks like the withdrawal process is taking longer because of the payment method used, and basically, the withdrawals are made regularly, without significant issues, constantly. Since the casino still pays your withdrawals (besides the 3 failed transactions), I cannot see a big problem there or anything that we could do to help you with.</p>
<p>Although the casino has not answered my questions above, and it is not clear what the reason for the previous unsuccessful transactions was, it looks like there is no option on how to speed up the process of withdrawal if you insist on using bank transfers only. Also, a few more questions arose, Luca8889.</p>
<p>If there is no activity on your account for a longer time, and you are only withdrawing your balance, are you sure you are still at the mentioned VIP level 3, and the higher withdrawal weekly limits still apply to your account?</p>
<p>What are the alternative payment methods available for you in your cashier? Is there a possibility you could use another payment method for withdrawals? For example, using an e-wallet or crypto (if it is allowed by the casino) may speed the withdrawal process up. Otherwise, it is likely you will have to accept the fact that the process of withdrawal will take longer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only way we could help you is to keep the complaint open and extend the timers by longer periods unless the entire remaining balance is withdrawn.</p>
