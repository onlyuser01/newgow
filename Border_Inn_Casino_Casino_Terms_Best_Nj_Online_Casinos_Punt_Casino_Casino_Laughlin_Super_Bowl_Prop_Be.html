<p>Super Bowl Prop Bets Get Silly, Cover Everything From Olympic Gold Medals to LeBron James Points</p>

<p>Super Bowl prop bets have been published at Las Vegas and online sportsbooks, and gamblers looking for the most exotic, perhaps absurd, betting opportunity on the big game are now in luck.</p>

<p>The Westgate SuperBook released its prop bet smorgasbord last night, with roughly 400 lines for the taking. While most are dependent on what actually happens in Super Bowl LII between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots, some are cross-sport propositions that are dependent on outside events.</p>
<p>For example, the Westgate is serving up odds on the number of points LeBron James will score on February 3 against the Houston Rockets versus the number of pass attempts Eagles quarterback Nick Foles will make during the February 4 Super Bowl. Foles is spotting James 6.5 points. Foles passed 33 times in the NFC Championship against the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Westgate gamblers can also bet on the number of gold medals the US will win during next month’s Winter Olympics against the total points scored by the Pats and Eagles in the first quarter. Because, who wasn’t looking for that line? The Westgate has it almost straight up, with Team USA a slight favorite in spotting the Super Bowl score -0.5.</p>
<p>As for the comical offerings, online sportsbook Bovada asks whether a player or coach will be arrested before kickoff (Yes +700, No -1500), and how many times President Trump will tweet on February 4 (Over 5 times -140, Under 5 even).</p>
<p>As for the actual spread, the Patriots remain the favorite, but the Eagles’ long odds have been shrinking. After opening as much as 6.5-point underdogs, the Westgate, Station Casinos, and Mirage now have New England spotting Philadelphia just 4.5 points. Caesars Palace has the line at five points, as does Wynn.</p>
<p>More ‘Serious’ Props</p>
<p>In addition to the rather “out there” betting opportunities, the Super Bowl prop bets do provide some added excitement and entertainment to the actual game.</p>
<p>At Caesars, bettors can take odds on whether an extra point kick will hit the goal post (crossbar, uprights, and support bar). “Yes” is the underdog at +330, and “No” about an 81 percent favorite at -420.</p>
<p>An over/under is up at the Westgate surrounding the jersey number of the first player to score a touchdown, with -110 odds on the number 32.5.</p>
<p>And Bovada has odds on whether a team will score in the first 2m30s of the game (Yes +500, No -800), and even the team to first call a timeout (even money).</p>
<p>MVP Odds</p>
<p>A bet that will attract plenty of action is the Super Bowl LII MVP. And it should come as no surprise that Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is the favorite at 4-5, or implied odds of nearly 56 percent.</p>
<p>Brady was named last year’s Super Bowl MVP when he led the Patriots to the largest comeback in Super Bowl history against the Atlanta Falcons. It marked the fourth time the great won the award.</p>
<p>Brady’s foe Foles is next at 3-1, followed by Patriots players Rob Gronkowski (12-1), Brandin Cooks (18-1), and Dion Lewis (20-1).</p>
