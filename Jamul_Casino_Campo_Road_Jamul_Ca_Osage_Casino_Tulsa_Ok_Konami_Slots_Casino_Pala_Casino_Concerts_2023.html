<p>Dear Wizebets,</p>
<p>I hope you can see yourself that these counter arguments have no basis nor merit.</p>
<p>1) Yes I did accept the cheer-up/personal bonus from the agent after repeatedly asking for my account to be closed. Due to my gambling issue, I would of course accept. I understand that I did not specifically mention the word addiction however I did state that I had an issue. Furthermore, the fact that I accepted the cheer up has nothing to do with your agent breaking your own terms and conditions.</p>
<p>2) You want to make your players comfortable then you should accept and grant their wishes to close their account when the tell you they have a problem.</p>
<p>3) The second time the closure request came in you finally acted. Actually I had requested my account to be closed 5 times. only after significant time had elapsed and I asked the 6th time, did the agent finally act.</p>
<p>4) The fact that I had a successful withdrawal has absolutely nothing to do with the situation. I had deposited 9000 and withdrew 2000. meaning I still suffered a 7000 euro loss.</p>
<p>5) "We respect players' decisions to close their accounts", this is absolutely not the case as I attempted to close my account 5 times and was only met with resistance. Meaning that you are simply lying here.</p>
<p>6) "3.7 Closure of your account: you may close your account at any time by contacting customer service, however, the below conditions apply." this is a term in your own terms and conditions and this was blatantly violated and I have suffered significant financial losses due to the violation of your won terms.</p>
<p>Although I appreciate your swift reply, I hope that you do not truely believe that your arguments have any basis whatsoever. Furthermore, the fact that you shall now train your staff is of zero use to me whatsoever.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bram Visser</p>
