<p>The period was favorable to the company and very favorable to its Amusement and Gaming &amp; Systems segments</p>
<p>Entertainment powerhouse Konami Group has posted its results for the first half of the fiscal year. The company reported its results for the six-month period ended September 30, marking a sharp increase in its Amusement and Gaming &amp; Systems segments.</p>
<p>The company’s overall revenue increased by 3.7% year-on-year to JPT 153.9 billion (roughly $1.02 billion). In the meantime, business profit skyrocketed by 38.3% to JPY 35.4 billion ($236.3 million).</p>
<p>Konami also reported an operating profit of JPY 35.4 billion ($236.3 million), which represents a staggering 39.6% year-on-year increase. Profit before income taxes, on the other hand, rose to JPY 37 billion ($247 million), while profit for the period increased to JPY 26.8 ($178.9 million), 35.2% up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Konami reported earnings per share of JPY 195.95.</p>
<p>The company also reported figures concerning its separate segments. The Digital Entertainment segment continued to comprise approximately two-thirds of the company’s total H1 revenue. It remained mostly stable at JPY 102.1 billion ($681 million), representing a YOY increase of 0.6%.</p>
<p>The Amusement segment was the biggest winner, recording a YOY change of 39.3%. The segment, which recorded revenue of JPY 7.2 billion in H1 FY2023, now posted JPY 10 billion ($66.7 million) in revenue.</p>
<p>The Gaming &amp; Systems segment also reported a significant YOY increase. These operations earned the company JPY 19.1 billion ($127 million) in H1 FY2024, up 11.6% YOY. The company’s Sports segment, meanwhile, increased by 6% to JPY 23.8 billion ($158.9 million).</p>
<p>Konami Publishes FY 2024 Guidance</p>
<p>Konami also published its full-year guidance, reporting its financial expectations for the fiscal year. Konami expects revenue to hit JPY 328 billion by the end of the year with a business profit of JPY 63 billion.</p>
<p>Revenue from the Digital Entertainment segment is expected to total JPY 216 billion. The Amusement sector, meanwhile, has a projected revenue of JPY 27 billion. The Gaming &amp; Systems vertical, on the other hand, should reach approximately JPY 39 billion. Finally, the Sports segment is expected to post revenue of JPY 49.5 billion.</p>
<p>The first half of the fiscal year saw Konami publish a number of new gaming and gambling titles. The second quarter of the year, for example, saw the company release a total of 10 new gaming cabinets. Nine of those were released in Japan with the exception of the DIMENSIONS 43×3 cabinet, which hit the North American market.</p>
