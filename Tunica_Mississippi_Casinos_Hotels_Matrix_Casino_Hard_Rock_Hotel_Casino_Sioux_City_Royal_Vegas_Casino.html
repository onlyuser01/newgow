    <h1>Tunica Mississippi Casinos Hotels Matrix Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Sioux City Royal Vegas Casino</h1>

<p>BetCity.nl has become the latest Dutch betting operator to join the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), reflecting on the brand’s commitment to safer and responsible gambling. Presently, all Netherlands-based online betting operators must sign up with an integrity monitor body.</p>
<p>The BetEnt brand has picked IBIA, whose members account for EUR 115 billion ($137 billion) of annual betting turnover and almost 50% of all regulated commercial online betting activity worldwide. The association actively combats corruption and represents the gambling sector at high-level policy discussion forums such as the IOC, UN, Council of Europe, and the European Commission.</p>
<p>The move comes after IBIA announced, citing H2 Gambling Capital data, that in 2022 turnover for online sports betting is estimated to be around EUR 2 billion ($2.26 billion) and to double by 2025 to EUR 4 billion ($4.53 billion).</p>
<p>Protecting the Sporting Community through Transparency</p>
<p>BetCity.nl head of operations Kylian Olierook commented on the partnership, noting that BetCity is proud to become a member of the IBIA and combat corruption to protect the integrity of sports while also protecting patrons at the same time. Olierook went on to note BetCity’s commitment to protecting both sports and the consumers through transparency and its collaboration with the IBIA.</p>
<p>IBIA expanded to the North American market earlier in February. Chief executive Khalid Ali remarked that the association will play a critical role in supporting and protecting the growth of the betting industry in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>He went on to say that more member announcements should be expected in the coming months from various US states and Ontario. The regulator is active across six continents and members undergo due diligence processes and must commit to responsible betting practices.</p>
<p>BetCity Remains a Responsible Member of Dutch Gambling</p>
<p>BetCity.nl, a BetEnt B.V. licensed sports betting brand, offers sports betting and the option of an online or live casino. It provides promotions and extra information regarding games and elaborate statistics that give users an edge when it comes to having a good time and being smarter all the more while going at it.</p>
<p>It also advocates for safe and responsible gaming and promotes the notion that knowing when to stop is a part of playing smartly. On December 15, 2021, BetCity’s responsible gaming team welcomed Iris den Boer and Milan Moser, who brought along their expertise from the gaming and banking sectors.</p>
<p>Before that, BetCity was also bolstered through the use of Kambi‘s technology after a multi-year agreement between the sports betting tech supplier and BetEnt and continues to strengthen its position. It was thanks to Kambi’s BetEnt sportsbook platform that BetCity.nl was able to launch its own forays into the Dutch betting market.</p>
