<p>Yolo Group, previously Coingaming Group, the operator behind the acclaimed Bitcasino and Sportsbet betting brands, has selected Oddin.gg as its iFrame solution provider. This marks a long process during which Yolo Group was looking to find a trusted partner that can help it elevate the esports betting experience across its flagship brands.</p>
<p>Enhancing the Esports Betting Experience</p>
<p>Thanks to Yolo Group’s interest in the sector, esports betting products are now available to millions of consumers who visit the Bitcasino and Sportsbet brands to browse for iGaming, sports betting and now esports betting solutions. Oddin.gg has been steadily expanding its footprint owing to its technical track record.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg has been able to achieve one of the best uptimes in the industry, making it a desired partner among betting agencies. The company has been a globally-recognized provider of odds solutions for the esports betting sector with Oddin recently pivoting towards the United States, where it expects big things.</p>
<p>The partnership between Oddin.gg and Yolo Group will allow them to focus on one of the busiest betting segments – live betting. Bitcasino director of casino Tauri Tiitsaar said:</p>
<p>“We’ve been monitoring available esports betting solutions to extend betting opportunities with the focus on engaging and entertaining content.” Bitcasino director of casino Tauri Tiitsaar</p>
<p>Tiitsaar said that Bitcasino has done its due diligence and was impressed with Oddin.gg’s products and design. Thanks to the company’s offer, Bitcasino will be able to offer esports-minded customers enhanced wagering on competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>Focus on Younger Generations of Consumers</p>
<p>Tiitsaar reaffirmed the company’s mission to continue attracting a young generation of players over the coming years who may find all they need at the website. “We cannot think of a better partner on that journey than Oddin.gg,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg managing director Marek Suchar welcomed the opportunity, speaking highly of Yolo Group as a partner:</p>
<p>“I am extremely excited that Yolo is joining us on this journey at the intriguing intersection of crypto, esports, and betting. With this deal, Oddin.gg has once again confirmed its place as the leading B2B esports end-to-end solution provider for companies venturing into esports betting.” Oddin.gg managing director Marek Suchar</p>
<p>This partnership is an opportunity for esports fans to continue to experience some of the best wagering products while at the same time familiarizing themselves with advanced products such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg’s product has been play-tested by numerous brands out there. The company landed its iFrame solution to Novusbet and BetBoom most recently.</p>
