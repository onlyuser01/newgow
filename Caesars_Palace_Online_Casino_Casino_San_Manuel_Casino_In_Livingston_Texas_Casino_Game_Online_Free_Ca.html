<p>Mystery Mission – To The Moon Gameplay &amp; Symbols</p>
<p>The game features top-tier graphics and a fitting soundtrack that sends players straight into the mood to explore the outer space. To score a win, players must match between three and six symbols on a line starting from left to right. The low-paying symbols are represented by rock-style icons colored in blue, green, purple, and orange and they reward players with 5x the initial bet for matching six of a kind. To score between 15x and 500x the stake, players must match a minimum of six robot arm, medallion, laser gun, Golden Martian, Robot, Mystery Martian, or Astronaut Hit symbols across the reels.</p>
<p>The game’s wild scatter is represented by the luminous moon symbol that substitutes all regular paying symbols and also acts as a scatter. Landing at least three moon symbols will trigger the bonus round where players can expect additional intergalactic riches. During the bonus round, players will see any landing mystery stacks filling the reels and being held in place for the remainder of the spins. Plus, each landing stack will bring an additional free spin. To score a win, players must land a minimum of three stacks during subsequent spins.</p>
<p>The Introduction of the Ante Bet</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s chief executive officer explained the new game “builds upon a fan favorite title” along with the huge win potential bright by the mystery stacks feature that is also part of the original game in the series. The company that signed an agreement with Sky Betting and Gaming in June decided to extend the reels and add an ante bet for the first in history.</p>
<p>Players are given the chance to switch on the Ante Bet at any time between different spins while still in the base game. The Ante Bet works by boosting the stake by 20% and attracting higher odds of landing a scatter symbol and engaging the Free Spins round.</p>
