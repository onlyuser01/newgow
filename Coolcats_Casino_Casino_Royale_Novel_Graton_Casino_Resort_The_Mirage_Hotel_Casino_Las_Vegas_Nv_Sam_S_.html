<p>The woman had bet $25 on the hand, plus the $1 progressive wager. The guest additionally placed a $5 side wager that won her an additional $25,000. In total, the Cal patron’s straight flush won $543,619.32.</p>

<p>Players on Winning Streak</p>
<p>The California table progressive win is only the latest in a series of headline-worthy jackpots hit recently in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Last week, Casino.org reported on a Harrah’s Las Vegas guest winning a $918,000 mega progressive jackpot playing Ultimate Texas Hold’em. That win came only days after a Las Vegas local won nearly $315,000 on a $5 bet playing video poker at the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The California Face Up Pai Gow Poker win came a little more than a month after another life-altering win happened in downtown Las Vegas. A guest in May at The D Casino won over $1.4 million on a progressive Wheel of Fortune slot.</p>
<p>Another Harrah’s Las Vegas guest won roughly $253,000 playing traditional Pai Gow Poker at the Strip casino in May.</p>
<p>Explainer: Face Up Pai Gow</p>
<p>Face Up Pai Gow Poker is a head-to-head game where players compete against the dealer or banker. In a progressive format, there is an optional add-on bet, typically $1, plus an Ace-High side bet.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional Pai Gow, Face Up is a commission-free game, meaning the house doesn’t take 5% of winnings. Here’s how the Face Up scheme is played.</p>
<p>Face Up Pai Gow Poker uses a single, standard 52-card deck, plus one joker. The dealer and player(s) each receive seven cards, with the dealer’s cards being dealt face up.</p>
<p>The goal is to assemble a five-card hand and a two-card hand that beats the dealer’s, or in the case of cardrooms, the player-designated banker. The five-card hand must always be of higher rank than the two-card hand.</p>
<p>Face Up Pai Gow is a relatively simple game to learn and play. It also comes with a small house edge of around just 1.8%.</p>
<p>But while many players assemble their best five-card hand and then simply use the two leftover cards as the two-card hand, that isn’t always the best strategy. Instead, it’s in the player’s best interest to consider how to make the best two-card hand that ranks just below the remaining five cards. The Face Up arrangement of the dealer’s cards makes it easier to decide how to build the two hands.</p>
<p>When the player wins both hands, they win even money on their bets. When the hands are split, it’s a push. If the dealer wins both, the player loses their bets.</p>
