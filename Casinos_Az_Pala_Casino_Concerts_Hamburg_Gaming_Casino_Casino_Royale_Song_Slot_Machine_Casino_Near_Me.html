    <h1>Casinos Az Pala Casino Concerts Hamburg Gaming Casino Casino Royale Song Slot Machine Casino Near Me</h1>

<p>I paste a text from another Casino opinion page about a user's experience:</p>
<p>"I ask you not to think about playing in this casino. After having reopened my account and they asked me to do so, it turns out that when I had 2000 euros deposited (I only play American roulette) I was lucky enough to bet €50 on double zero and it came out for what I got 1800 This was Thursday the 13th of this July.</p>
<p>Well, speaking with the manager named Caroline, she tells me that according to my agreement, the withdrawals would be in 3 or 4 days at most, leaving me to pay the 2000 that I withdrew, on Tuesday the 18th, which is today, or on Wednesday, July 19, which is tomorrow. .</p>
<p>She sends me an email today saying that between today the 18th and tomorrow the 19th they will pay me the 2000 and that she is waiting for me to tell her if the payment will be today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>What was my surprise when I just received an email from Manager SpitFire Casino saying that before approving my 2000 withdrawal they had noticed some irregularities in my play and winnings and that my account is under review.</p>
<p>This is something that some casinos use to avoid paying but it turns out that they cannot prove anything since there is no irregularity and thank goodness I made screens of all the biggest prizes, for example the one of €1800.</p>
<p>With this I make it clear that it is one of the worst casinos according to what can be read on various websites, for example Casino Guru, and that they are dedicated to scamming users with comments about irregularities that do not exist.</p>
<p>User in this casino: joberto.</p>
<p>I have screens of the prizes won in American roulette and I can send them if required</p>
<p>Date of experience: July 18, 2023"</p>
<p>It can be seen that this Casino systematically scams its users by not paying their winnings.</p>
