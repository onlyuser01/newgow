<p>Rizk Casino, a highly trusted and Malta Gaming Authority-licensed website, has revealed a new partnership with content supplier Swintt. The content alliance will focus on both the SwinttGames and SwinttPremium slots and portfolio which are now injected directly into Rizk’s game library.</p>
<p>Both partners focus on innovation with Rizk being known for its Wheel of Rizk bonus among other innovative and exciting marketing opportunities deployed over the years. For its part, Swintt will bring popular games and features such as the Aloha Spirit XtraLock and Tiki Respins bonus level. The SwinttPremium library offers players a chance to explore classic titles such as Seven Seven Pots and Pearls as well as access the Pearl and Mystery Bonus features.</p>
<p>Rizk Casino Gaming Operations Manager Laszlo Hornyak hailed this opportunity to expand the operator’s existing library of titles. Hornyak explained that Rizk is focused on ensuring that its library is filled with worthwhile and reliable titles by the best providers.</p>
<p>"The combination of SwinttGames and SwinttPremium provides the perfect balance and adds premium touch to our ever-expanding games lobby," Hornyak added.</p>
<p>Swintt CEO David Mann was similarly pleased with the deal and the opportunity it presented for both the company and Rizk Casino’s players. Swintt is definitely interested in expanding under the MGA banner further, Mann explained, and said that Rizk is a fitting partner.</p>
<p>"They are a hugely respected operator, and their platform is the perfect place for us to showcase our innovative approach to slot games to a new audience," Mann explained. Swintt has been actively building its presence in various markets.</p>
<p>The company established itself with Circus.nl in the Netherlands just a few weeks ago, and the supplier has also been pushing steadily to form alliances with some of the world’s biggest iGaming brands.</p>
<p>In a similar content alliance, Swintt negotiated a deal with Kindred Group, an operator of many prominent brands in the iGaming landscape. Meanwhile, the Rizk brand, owned by Betsson Group, has been driving steady forays into the regulated gambling market in Europe. Recently, Rizk launched in Serbia, recognizing the market as one of the biggest business opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>Rizk Casino is recognized in Casino Guru’s Safety Index, which has awarded a 9.9 out of 10 to the casino, which is a well-established and trusted brand in multiple jurisdictions covered by international and domestic licenses.</p>
