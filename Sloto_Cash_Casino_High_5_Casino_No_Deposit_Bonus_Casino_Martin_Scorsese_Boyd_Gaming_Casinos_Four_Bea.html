<p>UK Gambling Commission Executive Director Tim Miller has penned a new update in which he detailed the progress the regulator has made in moving forward with the Government’s Gambling Act Review. Miller said that the watchdog has already made some progress, particularly in the area that concerned White Labels, and a forthcoming approach to vulnerability is soon to be detailed as part of web content.</p>
<p>Miller spoke about the regulator’s commitment to building an evidence-based approach and focus on a strong research methodology. He also said that four consultations will be most likely published this month.</p>
<p>The four consultations have to do with age verification in gaming venues, remote games design, with the UKGC already working on slots with developers, direct marketing, and cross-selling opportunities, such as whether consumers want to receive such inducements in the first place, and not least – a closer look at the financial risk and vulnerability checks for remote operators.</p>
<p>The UKGC will also release two other important consultations, specifically to do with the Personal Management Licenses rules and Regulatory Panels procedures, as confirmed by Miller. All of these major consultations will take around 12 weeks before they are ended and a decision is made on how to move forward.</p>
<p>There will be more consultations coming forth after that as well, including Social Responsibly Inducements and Gambling Management Tools. In a word, the UKGC is trying to make good on its promise and work closely with the government to ensure that consumers are protected.</p>
<p>The White Paper promised to introduce sweeping reforms that significantly bolster consumer protection, but gambling hawks have seen the measures as insufficient and still allowing companies to "prey" on vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>"The Commission has a key role in advising the Government on amending aspects of the legislation and on implementation of these changes. It is important that we are clear on roles and responsibilities," Miller wrote, remaining optimistic about the role that the regulator can play in advising the government on what the best course of action is.</p>
<p>There has been no specific timeline for when particular decisions from the Gambling Act Review may be implemented. Ultimately, however, the goal of this process is to make gambling fairer, safer, and crime-free in the space of just several years, Miller concluded.</p>
