    <h1>Crazy Time Casino Live Bahamas Casino Casino Niagra Falls Ip Casino And Resort In Biloxi Online Casi</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>I do live in a basement suite I live in my moms basement suite and I still share her Wi-Fi with her but I am pretty certain that she did not open up an account in my name as for one she is not a avid gambler at all or in any means or terms of the word so I do not feel that she did that I asked her she said no and I believe her and the other person I live with I asked as well and he said no and I do believe him as well because he is not a gambler either and would have no reason to lie to me or do that. the only yes we do allow our guests to use our Wi-Fi if they so desire when they’re here.?asked my friends that have been here and they all have said no andI do believe then. somebody who was at my moms house and used her Wi-Fi maybe but I again really dont think any would, she is a retired lady and religious she doesn’t swear doesn’t steal doesn’t lie doesn’t cheat she’s very straight and narrow as well as all of her friends are so I do not believe thatanybody in my household created a account and if they did they are keeping it a secret from me, that doesn’t fault me for that because I was not the one who did it so why do I get accused but by all means delete my account and I would be OK with that but I do not feel that I should have to suffer consequences for something that I did not do or commit personally believe that this is all a scam and has all been forged in my name. from the day I opened up this account I have had nothing but issues with this Casino I have had games that double Dipz on spins as well as they have bingo that is not by chance or by luck in any means and usually when the game begins the other players or the box or whatever they used to state that there is somebody else playing along with you start out with a space that is filled before even the first call is made so they’re already giving themselves one space before I even see what is called. I have tried to discuss it with them and every single time I get called a liar and treated as if I am a criminal and I am just trying to make sure that it’s done fairly and everything is played fairly. They are most part rude and will never admit that maybe they could be a glitch in their system or even a little computer error something wrong that I’ve never once had then possibly admit that it could be something in terms of technical issues. I am wrong and they will not even consider the fact that they could be possibly at fault they fight me and fight me on it I have never ever been compensated for any of my losses that I have taken and there have been a number. I have caused them grief in the past because I chose to fight for justice and to fight for the fact that I was being taken advantage of. I fight fairly but aggressively because these pretentious customer service as they called them selves are completely rude ignorant and it’s so frustrating dealing with them for anything it is the worst experience in the world and I feel that they have take me as a troublemaker because I don’t just let it go and leave it alone I tend to argue my case and now they r paying me back for causing them grief. A person tends to get upset and angry and I probably said say a few things they shouldn’t have but in the end I did not open up more then one account. I do honestly believe that this is avvindictive choice on their part to single me. And now going to take my winnings from me to. Yes this is an assumption on my part I asked to cancel my account because I was tired of being ripped off they beg me to not close my account and to continue being a customer and even gave me a couple of free spins for doing so I have deposited money into my account numerous times I have have taken free spins. I won off of money I had deposited into my account it was not on a promotion so I was not breaking any terms in that I also played Theo all wagers agreements I did deposit before I won and I won that money through a deposit so I played the game fair and square and rightfully and there’s no reason why they should be saying I’ve reached any terms of agreement so yeah other than that I can’t really help you more than to say that I do have a account with their jet bingo which is a different platform same company but it’s a different name so therefore I am allowed to have a an account with both of them that isn’t wrong or against the rules so other than that that’s all I can say but I again will definitely reiterate that I do believe this is a personal vendetta and this is just a form of them trying to be vindictive and to make me suffer for standing up to them and not allowing them to take a vantageWithout a phone so I hope that helps you and out if you have anymore questions definitely feel free to get back to me either email or on here I will keep checking in to see how things are thank you have a great day</p>
