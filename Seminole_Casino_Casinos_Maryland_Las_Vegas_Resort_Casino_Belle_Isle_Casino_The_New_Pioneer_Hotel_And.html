<p>Paysafe is upping the ante and introducing a brand-new VIP program that will cover the Skrill USA payment option. The digital wallet and associated gambling transactions will be part of the new program that will empower high rollers in the United States to enjoy their favorite games of chance online.</p>
<p>Paysafe is launching the program on the PlayUp USA Sportsbook, but it’s planning to expand further as new operators and industry stakeholders show interest. The program will essentially enable players to enjoy some of the highest deposit limits available in the regulated gambling market in the United States.</p>
<p>A player will be able to increase their depositlimit several hundred times by simply joining the VIP program at PlayUp USA, expanding the opportunities for high rollers who want to transact their money quickly and without issues. However, the operator will exert the utmost care in screening who qualifies and who is eligible to apply for the program.</p>
<p>The introduction of high-stakes gambling online would mean more regulatory scrutiny and demands for tighter AML and KYC controls. Now that it’s up and running on PlayUp USA, Skrill is planning to ensure that the program can reach more players. To get there, it would need to extend to other operators across state borders which will make the product available to more brands, but also their customers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the program, Paysafe North America Head of iGaming Zak Cutler said that VIP customers do tend to opt for digital wallets when this is possible. Cutler argued that because of the forward-thinking approach demonstrated by Paysafe, Skrill USA is en route to becoming the intuitive pick for high rollers in the United States.</p>
<p>PlayUp USA Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Smith said that the partnership was an opportunity for the company to take even better care of its VIP customers. Thanks to Skrill USA, PlayUp would be able to onboard them even quicker while ensuring that due diligence protocols are kept intact.</p>
<p>"Having a platform like Skrill USA allows us to have very little friction in the deposit process with our VIPs but still be fully compliant with the regulatory standards that are in place," Smith added in a press statement.</p>
