    <h1>Casino Bingo Social Casinos Casinos Cerca De Mi Horshoe Casino Baltimore Penn Play Casino Home Casin</h1>

<p>Please don't mess with skill, in my opinion, since the cancel is gone, we might be on the right track and the money will be credited. Did your cancel go right or is it still there?</p>
<p>Exactly the same answer to me I probably need to see in skrill</p>
<p>They just answered me... live my May, eat clover!!!! the same and the same.</p>
<p>Anyway it's still under development and will be finished soon</p>
<p>In the mails, what do they tell you, is it progressing?</p>
<p>My friend, I'm running out of patience, I hope the money comes to all of us and we get the heck out of it...</p>
<p>In all transactions he has (withdrawals/deposits) he has a code with numbers and numbers. They are not invalid, they are the codes of the movement you make (so I think).</p>
<p>Gkara22, do they answer you in the chat?? is the cancel available or has it disappeared? also in your transactions, was the account written correctly or was it giving you invalid letters and numbers??? let's see brothers and sisters!!</p>
<p>Exactly what you say, it writes invalid letters and numbers to me too, they don't answer me in the chat!!!</p>
<p>And me on the 25th of the month, yes, as I mentioned above, a while ago, he disappeared, but no one is answering the chat!! Also a question if you enter the transactions in the withdrawal information do they write your account normally?? It shows me invalid letters and numbers</p>
<p>I just now went into the casino account in transactions and the cancel is gone.....and you the same???</p>
<p>We drank him dudes!!!!! I am told to wait 2 more working days. Finally you will be paid with skrill or sepa Sotiris????? what do they say to you brother?</p>
