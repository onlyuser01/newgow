<p>Hall of Fame NFL quarterback Dan Marino has signed an exclusive partnership with Pixiu Gaming, an established North American developer of iGaming and Keno experiences. The partnership will see the company use Marino’s image and likeness and help create exciting new slot games that will seek to appeal to US casino players who remember Marino’s notable track record with the Miami Dolphins. The news was shared by GameOn, a marketing agency.</p>
<p>He spent 17 seasons with the team and made history before retiring in 2000. Now, the man is back in Pixiu’s upcoming range of slots which will seek to introduce players to fresh and innovative features and hit markets across North America in the second quarter of 2023. Pixiu is readying up to launch the products in both Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>The profits realized by the slots will also go towards helping the Dan Marino Foundation, a not-for-profit the NFL legend helped set up in order to help individuals with developmental challenges and autism and help them achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>Five percent of the profits from the new slots will be forwarded to the Foundation. Marino commented on the partnership, congratulating Pixiu’s development nous and expertise and adding:</p>
<p>We were very impressed with Pixiu’s focus on the same core values we have. We welcome their generous offer to donate to my Foundation and are excited to see the positive impact we can achieve from the partnership.</p>
<p>Pixiu Gaming’s Tony Plaskow said that he was a huge fan of the NFL and he saw Marino as a great partner. He also thanked the quarterback for the opportunity to help the Foundation as Plaskow said it was a meaningful and important undertaking that Pixiu wanted to support. All that remains is for the launch that will happen around mid-2023.</p>
<p>Marino also holds numerous NFL records, including 40 single-season and career passing ones. He has the most completions at 4,967 and he has been able to score the most passing yards in the sport’s history, at 61,361. Not only that, but he also holds the most touchdown passes at 420. Pixiu is confident that his likeness will help the company leverage its innovative slot experience while committing to the good causes spearheaded by the Dan Marino Foundation across the world.</p>
