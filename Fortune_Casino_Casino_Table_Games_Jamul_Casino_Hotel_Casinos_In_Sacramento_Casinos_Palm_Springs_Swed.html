<p>The new license expands further the presence of the company on the Old Continent and enables its games to reach new audiences</p>
<p>The fast-growing iGaming content provider, Hacksaw Gaming, announced it expanded further its European footprint after securing a new business-to-business (B2B) license. On Monday, the company confirmed that the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA), approved its B2B gaming license.</p>
<p>This license enabled Hacksaw Gaming to deliver its content to gambling operators licensed within the market in the country. As a result, famous games such as Hand of Anubis, Dork Unit, Mines, as well as Wanted Dead or a Wild will be arriving to new operators.</p>
<p>Besides expanding further the company’s presence in Sweden, the new license boosts its European footprint as well. The latest announcement comes after only recently, Hacksaw expanded further its Swedish footprint via a partnership with Glitnor Group.</p>
<p>Last month, the iGaming content provider joined forces with the Group, allowing it to deliver its portfolio of content for players of the brands LuckyCasino and HappyCasino. Now, the new license will enable Hacksaw to continue to grow in the country and reach new audiences.</p>
<p>The Company Is Thrilled to Expand Further in Sweden</p>
<p>Securing the license comes at a strategic time for the market in the country. This is because new regulations were implemented on March 1, 2023, requiring all online casino game suppliers to have a license. Ultimately, the new Swedish regulation seeks to boost the channelization of the legal markets, and protect the integrity of the industry, as well as the consumers.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be among the first providers to obtain a full Swedish B2B gaming license, allowing us to build from a position of strength in the fast-growing market.“ Marcus Cordes, CEO of Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming’s CEO, shared his excitement saying that the company was able to act quickly within the market which helped it gain a head-start. Additionally, he said that Hacksaw is excited to be one of the first iGaming providers to secure a complete B2B gaming license in Sweden.</p>
<p>Cordes predicted that the collaboration will help the company continue to grow within the market. Finally, he said that thanks to the B2B license, Hacksaw will be able to team up with new gambling operators and engage with new audiences.</p>
<p>“The purpose of the license requirement for gaming software is to discourage illegal gambling.“ Swedish Gambling Authority</p>
<p>The SGA added that the new licenses seek to repeal and combat illegal gambling operators. The Authority also noted that illegal gambling operators must not be able to team up with companies such as suppliers of iGaming content that deliver software or solutions for licensed gambling operators in Sweden.</p>
