    <h1>Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino Montbleu Resort Casino Spa Dream Casino No Deposit Bonus Code Ca</h1>

<p>on wednesday the 19th my account was fully verified during a phone call with the vip manager of the casino. Later that evening i tried to withdraw 250 euro via BTC. This was processed a day later but the amount didn't show up in my wallet for the next few days, the casino kept promissing it would be there by the end of the day, in the end the amount was send back to the gaming account and i contacted support again telling them it was back to the account and they ensured some techinical issue happened and i could try again and withdrawal would be done with high priority and would be send asap. Again this failed and again i was promissed a lot like "high prioirty" "today it will be there" etc. etc. on wednesday i wrote an online negative review about the casino as they fail to communicate and process the withdrawal, on thursday the second attempt also failed and i was given the feedback on the review that i should use a different withdrawal method than btc so i withdraw the money via bank wire, later that day i was called by the casino manager and he litterally tolled me that "if i would not take the negative review offline the finance department would think twice about sending me the money". This is pure blackmail even worse, the negative review is fully justified. Normal process time of a withdrawal at the casino is within 24 hours, its been 3 days now and its still not processed leaving me to believe they are not processing my withdrawal because of the negative feedback. The casino does not want to talk to me on the support chat anymore and also does not reply to my emails send every day since.</p>
