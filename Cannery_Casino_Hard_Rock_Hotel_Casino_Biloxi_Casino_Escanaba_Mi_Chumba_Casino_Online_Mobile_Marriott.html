<p>International Game Technology (IGT) is busy in a number of gaming verticals but especially looks to be the king of lotteries. It has already signed several new lottery deals this year in various countries, and just added one more.</p>
<p>As Singapore’s gaming industry undergoes a transformation, the rules of what is and isn’t acceptable have been clarified. Just days later, IGT announced the signing of an expanded partnership with land-based sports betting and lottery operator Singapore Pools.</p>
<p>IGT announced yesterday that IGT Global Services Limited will partner with Singapore’s lottery operator, Singapore Pools. The subsidiary will deploy a new central system, as well as its Aurora Navigator, Data Connector, and Aurora Anywhere products. This deal continues a relationship that IGT has had with Singapore Pools since 1986.</p>
<p>Rapid Expansion of Lottery Ops</p>
<p>IGT has inked several arrangements recently. This past February, it received a 20-year extension from the Rhode Island Lottery. Then, earlier this month, IGT signed a lottery deal with La Lotería Nacional (LOTENAL), Mexico’s National Lottery.</p>
<p>IGT will offer LOTENAL a full range of services, including instant ticket distribution and lottery game transactions. The partnership includes the continuous development of new B2B channels, installation, repair, and maintenance of its entire lottery terminal base, as well as other enhancements.</p>
<p>IGT, through its IGT Global Solutions Corporation, IGT México Lottery, S. de R.L. de C.V., and IGT SME, S. de R.L. de C.V. subsidiaries, will provide an integrated draw-based system and instant ticket central, lottery terminals, and a communications network as part of the contract. The subsidiaries will also offer ongoing marketing services like research and game planning, and services such as a trading advisory for sports betting, odds setting and risk management.</p>
<p>Sadusky Takes the Bull by the Horns</p>
<p>Vincent Sadusky has only led IGT since January, relieving former CEO Marco Sala. Since then, however, he has been on a mission and doesn’t appear to be slowing down.</p>
<p>Sadusky, who has been a part of IGT’s board of directors since 2009, made clear his objectives for the company in a recent financial update. He explained that he is unraveling a strategy that includes growth, innovation, and optimization for 2022, propelled by the company’s “accelerated recovery” from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The new boss added that IGT has a “robust pipeline” in place to support research and development for its Digital &amp; Betting unit. This, he explains, is where the company is witnessing most of its growth. Sadusky wants to make sure it has all the resources it needs to keep that momentum going.</p>
