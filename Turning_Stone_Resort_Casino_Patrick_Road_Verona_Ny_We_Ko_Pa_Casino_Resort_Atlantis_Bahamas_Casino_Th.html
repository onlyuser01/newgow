<p>Dear emil45,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I wonder if there even is a term you didn't breach while playing in this casino. Perhaps, that you all were of a legal age to play in a casino, but that's about it.</p>
<p>First of all, the only person who should have had access to this account is the account owner, and no one else.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the payment method used to make deposits and withdrawals must be issued in the name of the account owner. I have been dealing with player complaints for almost four years now, but four different people depositing into one account and playing all together is really something different.</p>
<p>But let's continue - by using the same payment method to deposit or withdraw from two completely different accounts you basically asked for blocked accounts, or at least accusations of creating multiple accounts.</p>
<p>And lastly, you even confess to bonus hunting which is closely monitored and prohibited by all online casinos. Very impressive, I must admit.</p>
<p>Guys, you are young and I am sure that there are better activities other than online gambling in which you all can participate together without risking anything.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but there is no chance that we (or anyone else in my honest opinion) could help you here, after breaching so many basic rules of online gambling. We always try our best to help each player and look at their issue from their perspective, but in this case, our hands are tied.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
