<p>Sagstuen's appointment as acting CEO is effective from September 1, and she will remain in the role until Norsk hires a permanent director</p>
<p>The Norwegian government-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, announced it has started the process of appointing a new chief executive officer (CEO). The company confirmed Monday that starting from September 1, 2023, Tonje Sagstuen will take over the role of acting CEO, until a permanent appointment is announced.</p>
<p>Sagstuen is a famous handball player from Norway, as well as an Olympic medalist. Most notably, she received silver medals during the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Throughout her extensive sports career, Sagstuen has participated in more than 210 games for the country’s national team.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Sagstuen has been a part of Norsk Tipping. She currently holds a director role with a focus on social responsibility, society and other community initiatives. This new appointment comes on the heels of the announced departure of the company’s outgoing CEO, Lars Buer Eriksen. Judging by the latest announcement, he will leave Norsk Tipping, effective from August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Although Eriksen held the role of CEO for less than a year, he played an important role in the development of different social initiatives, as well as gambling policies. He joined Norsk Tipping back in September last year, after its CEO at the time, Åsne Havenelid, decided to step down due to personal reasons.</p>
<p>Upon announcing his departure, Eriksen said: “In one year, I have become very happy with Norsk Tipping’s social mission and our employees. Overseeing a strong and future-oriented Norwegian railways is exciting and something I have chosen to accept.”</p>
<p>The Government-Owned Gambling Operator Seeks New CEO</p>
<p>Sylvia Brustad, Norsk’s chairman, explained that Norsk has already started the process for the replacement of Eriksen. She explained that an extensive search will take place to ensure that the company finds the best manager that can help it continue growing. Finally, Brustad thanked Sagstuen for agreeing to take the role of acting CEO until a permanent management director is appointed.</p>
<p>“I am happy that Tonje has agreed to lead the company until a new managing director can take over.“ Sylvia Brustad, chairman of Norsk Tipping AS</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government-owned gambling operator revealed that it implemented a new safer gambling policy. Back in June, Norsk said that it overhauled the loss limits for young adults, aged 20 and less. Thanks to this policy, a cap for the maximum loss limit for those age groups was set at NOK 2,000 ($181).</p>
