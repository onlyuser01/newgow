    <h1>Danville Casino Pioneer Gambling Hall And Casino Sacramento Casinos Casa Blanca Hotel Casino L Auber</h1>

<p>Galaxy Gaming, a B2B provider of casino games and technology has added another industry heavyweight to its leadership team. The one joining the company is Steph Nel, an experienced long-time industry worker, who will be working as Galaxy Gaming’s senior vice president of worldwide sales.</p>
<p>Nel Has Decades of Experience</p>
<p>In his new position, Nel will head the sales team and help Galaxy Gaming expand its reach across the globe. He is well-equipped for the job thanks to his extensive experience in the sector. It should be noted that the new appointee has worked in the gaming sector for over two decades.</p>
<p>Nel’s expertise comes from having worked in various positions for multiple companies across several continents. He started his career in Africa as a humble dealer for Tsogo Sun Monte Casino before becoming a table inspector at Gold Reef City Casino. Sever years later, Nel was named as TCS John Huxley’s business development manager and helped the company roll out table products.</p>
<p>After almost six years at TCS John Huxley, Nel left the company and had a short stint as AxesNetwork’s VP of sales for Africa. Nel was promoted to the position of a chief commercial officer after a year but left the company soon after.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Galaxy Gaming, the new appointee worked for TCSJOHNHUXLEY, a leading manufacturer and supplier of end-to-end live gaming solutions and services. As a part of the company, Nel began as a senior business development manager. He was later promoted to general manager for the Americas and eventually became the company’s managing director for the region.</p>
<p>The New Appointee Is a Great Addition to Galaxy’s Team</p>
<p>Nel’s career has seen him work for numerous companies across three continents (Africa, Europe and North America). His experience makes him well-suited to lead Galaxy Gaming’s global sales strategy.</p>
<p>Thanks to his diligence, Nel recently received the prestigious Emerging Leaders of Gaming 40 Under 40 award. The award, given by the Global Gaming Business Magazine, celebrates young industry workers that are making a change.</p>
<p>Nel spoke about his new position, saying that he is glad to be joining Galaxy Gaming and its team.</p>
<p>I look forward to advancing Galaxy’s market growth with the support of their strong reputation of best-in-class service, a robust customer-focused sales team, and impressive portfolio of world-famous and innovative table games and solutions. Steph Nel, SVP worldwide sales, Galaxy Gaming</p>
<p>Todd Cravens, Galaxy Gaming’s president and chief executive, welcomed Nel to the company. He praised Nel’s experience and skills and said that he will be a great addition to the team.</p>
<p>Steph Nel is a seasoned gaming professional with a strong background in table games and a proven track record as a sales leader. We’re delighted to have him join our team. Todd Cravens, CEO, Galaxy Gaming</p>
<p>A month ago Galaxy Gaming launched a new digital arm called Galaxy Gaming Digital.</p>
