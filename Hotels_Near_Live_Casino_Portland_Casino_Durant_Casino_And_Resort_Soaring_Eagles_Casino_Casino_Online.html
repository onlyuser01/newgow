<p>FanDuel launches mobile operations in Indiana</p>
<p>Blue Chip Casino is the company’s partner in the state</p>
<p>FanDuel continues to expand mobile betting offer across the U.S.</p>
<p>Daily fantasy and sportsbook platform FanDuel has launched its mobile betting platform in Indiana today, Tuesday, October 22.</p>
<p>FanDuel Opens Mobile Operations in Indiana Today</p>
<p>FanDuel has been given the go-ahead to introduce its mobile sports betting platform in Indiana starting today, October 22. The company has teamed up with the Blue Chip Casino for the purpose.</p>
<p>The Michigan-based casino will host one of the most popular mobile betting solutions in the U.S. only two months after the state approved remote sports betting on September 1. While, retail operations started right away, vetting and giving green light for mobile betting took a while.</p>
<p>In fact, FanDuel will be only the 3rd mobile betting platform to do so. BetRivers.com was launched on October 3 as a joint project between Rush Street Interactive (RSI), the popular content provider, and Lick Casino.</p>
<p>Just a day after that, DraftKings – one of the main competitors for FanDuel – introduced its own platform on October 4. The race for dominance in the mobile betting industry has been ongoing.</p>

<p>– The Greenbrier New Jersey – Meadowlands Racetrack</p>
<p>– Meadowlands Racetrack Iowa – Diamond Jo (pending)</p>
<p>– Diamond Jo (pending) New York – Tioga Downs</p>
<p>FanDuel has expanded into Pennsylvania in July with Valley Forge and it arrived in West Virginia late in August with The Greenbrier. The Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) operator has been similarly interested in tie more high-profile partnerships that help it consolidate its position as a trusted authority on the U.S. betting landscape.</p>
<p>Similarly, FanDuel operates the Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey. Presently, FanDuel is anticipating a launch in Iowa with Boyd’s Diamond Jo. New York has also recently passed sports betting laws, but FanDuel – and all other operators – are limited to retail betting. FanDuel operates in Tioga Downs in the Empire States.</p>
<p>FanDuel and the NFL</p>
<p>FanDuel recently signed a deal with NFL franchise The Indianapolis Colts. The partnership will see the fantasy betting platform and the team partner for the 2019/2020 Season. As part of the deal, the entities will focus on coming up with new ways to drive fan engagement, including:</p>
<p>Digital</p>
<p>Radio</p>
<p>TV Advertising</p>
<p>Promotions</p>
<p>Pat McAfee, formerly of the Colts, will now be featured in various FanDuel Group’s initiatives, including the “More Ways to Win” TV Show. In addition, McAfee will appear on FanDuel podcasts, help create branded content to distribute on social media and more all throughout the NFL season.</p>
<p>Indiana posted great sports betting results in September, bringing in nearly $35 million in sports betting handle and estimated $8.5 million in revenue. The Chicago area generated the greatest results, with over 40% of the revenue going to two casinos located in the area.</p>
<p>Now that more mobile sports betting options are available, Indiana is preparing to post an even stronger October handle. Lawmakers do not oblige sports fans to register in person before they can make their wagers.</p>
