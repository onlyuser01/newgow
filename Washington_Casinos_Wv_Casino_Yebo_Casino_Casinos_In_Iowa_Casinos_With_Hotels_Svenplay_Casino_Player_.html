    <h1>Washington Casinos Wv Casino Yebo Casino Casinos In Iowa Casinos With Hotels Svenplay Casino Player</h1>

<p>Hello. The Sven-play Casino is abusing my rights and withholding my winnings illegally. During verification, they requested a screenshot of my transfers to Neteller account. This screenshot also show previous translations to me from my friend. Casino officials decided that it was illegal, they blocked my account and took away the winnings. I wrote to the casino several times, but they refuse to cooperate. That's why I'm asking you for help.</p>
<p>These transfers from my friend are part of my personal funds. For the game and used personal funds. My friend has nothing to do with gambling. At the end of September, I borrowed money to my friend. It was a loan. On the day of the Sven-play casino game, my friend gave me the money back in parts. That's my money. I can prove this with a screenshot from Neteller, where it is clear that I am sending him my own money at the end of September. I know the rules of the casino very well and would not use other people's money to play. I also attach correspondence with my friend to the complaint, which shows that he is going to pay me back the debt on October 14th. The day I played at the casino. There he wrote that he could not return all the money to me and would return it in parts. I'm sure that's enough to prove my integrity. I don't like the casino manipulating the facts in its favor. They use only part of the facts that are beneficial to them and refuse to consider other evidence on my part. I believe that these actions can be assessed as fraud and abuse of rights.</p>
<p>I demand that the casino return my deposits and winnings. I'm asking you to help me. Thank you in advance.</p>
