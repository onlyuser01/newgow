<p>Play’n GO has announced that the company’s performance in December 2023 has surpassed any other month in history</p>
<p>The leading supplier of casino entertainment responsible for creating premium business-to-business online slots, Play’n GO, has proclaimed the month of December 2023 as the highest-performing month in all of its history.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has reached a record number in terms of rounds played, daily active players, as well as gross gambling revenue. Here is a breakdown of the factors that helped the company reach the impressive toll.</p>
<p>Blockbuster Game Releases and Breakout Performances</p>
<p>A series of Blockbuster releases including Gargantoonz in November and the fantastic breakout performance of the studio’s iconic Piggy Blitz recorded in the US where the title was ranked first in New Jersey compared to all new releases are the primary reasons for the record figures.</p>
<p>Other similarly popular titles released by Play’n GO over the past months are Raging Rex 3 and Legacy of Dynasties, two games that keep building upon the studio’s original franchises.</p>
<p>The standout numbers are a clear reflection of the company’s success in regulated markets worldwide and rapidly follows its previous one-day record set for the largest number of rounds played on November 1 (250 million rounds).</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also strengthened its foothold in the entertainment world by announcing the launch of Play’n GO Music at the start of December 2023 while also becoming one of MoneyGram Haas F1 Team’s sponsors.</p>
<p>The Swedish gaming giant’s fresh music division will see it work together with a series of artists for the development of audio for upcoming games, marking a pioneering move in the industry.</p>
<p>Play’n GO: “Can’t Wait to See What 2024 Brings”</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive officer and co-founder, Johan Törnqvist, took the opportunity to explain that while they have been around for two decades, they are “only just getting started” while expressing eagerness to see what 2024 has in store for them.</p>
<p>Törnqvist also commented on their ongoing growth plans, saying he was “immensely proud of the entire team today” while also using the opportunity to emphasize they can keep growing and breaking their own records.</p>
<p>The CEO called December “a great month” for the company that did not happen by chance. He explained that it took hard work and innovation across all business areas which is often not visible to observers.</p>
<p>Törnqvist added that it was “brilliant to see great financial results that confirm we’re on a great path towards a sustainable and thriving business for many years to come.”</p>
<p>During the same record-breaking month, Play’n GO announced its growth on Italian soil via a new William Hill agreement.</p>
