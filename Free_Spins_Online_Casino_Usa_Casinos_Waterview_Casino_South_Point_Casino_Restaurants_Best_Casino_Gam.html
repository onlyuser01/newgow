    <h1>Free Spins Online Casino Usa Casinos Waterview Casino South Point Casino Restaurants Best Casino Gam</h1>

<p>Thank you for your email, Flowe1119. I have checked the T&amp;Cs, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„2.13. With regards to deposits and withdrawals of funds into and from your Account, you acknowledge that you shall only use such payment methods and other financial instruments that are valid and issued by lawful institutions and that legally belong to you solely. The use of financial instruments whose ownership is shared with other individuals, is not tolerated and may result in voiding of winnings and closure of accounts"</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during the account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If your name is not the same as the name on the bank statement and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use such a payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
