<p>Manchester City vs Manchester United is the 2023 FA Cup Final, which is on the program on Saturday, June 3</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Manchester City as a -200 favorite in the 2023 FA Cup Final. However, Manchester United mustnâ€™t be underestimated as the Red Devils are incredibly hungry for trophies. Itâ€™s been six years since they won silverware the last time. Maybe their trophy drought ends on Saturday?</p>

<p>Manchester City Going for the Treble</p>
<p>Manchester City has already won the English Premier League, and Pep Guardiolaâ€™s boys have made it to the final of the 2023 Champions League. They take on Inter Milan next Saturday, while this weekend, theyâ€™re locking horns with Manchester United in the 2023 FA Cup Final. Whatâ€™s interesting is that Guardiolaâ€™s men are favored to win both of those games.</p>
<p>The main reason is that the Citizens have an incredibly strong roster in 2023. Theyâ€™re strong in all aspects of the game, but especially in the offense. Itâ€™s no surprise because theyâ€™ve got Erling Haaland as their number 9. This guyâ€™s been nothing short of incredible since joining Man City, scoring 52 goals in 50 games in all competitions.</p>
<p>Knowing this, itâ€™s kind of strange that he hasnâ€™t scored a single goal since May 14. Maybe that changes on Saturday?</p>
<p>Manchester United Going All-In on Saturday</p>
<p>The Champions League is the No. 1 priority for Manchester City as thatâ€™s the only trophy these guys havenâ€™t won. When it comes to their city rivals, the Red Devils only have the FA Cup Final to think about. Itâ€™s their final game of the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Erik ten Hag gives one of the great rev-up speeches and Old Trafford is BOUNCING ðŸŽ¤</p>
<p>'When I talk about support, there is still one game to go!'</p>
<p>Manchester United fans, soak it in.#OptusSport pic.twitter.com/jxCtPpYa3D â€” Optus Sport (@OptusSport) May 28, 2023</p>
<p>Erik Ten Hagâ€™s boys have huge motivation to win this game as it would be their first trophy since 2017. Unfortunately for them, not all of Man Unitedâ€™s key men will get to play on Saturday. The thing is that a couple of them are sidelined due to injuries.</p>
<p>Anthony Martial, Phil Jones, Lisandro Martinez, Marcel Sabitzer, and Donny van de Beek are all listed as injured. Plus, Anthony remains doubtful for Saturdayâ€™s game.</p>
<p>2023 FA Cup Final Prediction</p>
<p>It would be crazy not to think of Manchester City as the favorite to win the 2023 FA Cup. The Sky Blues will win Saturdayâ€™s Manchester Derby, but we do think the Red Devils will give them a run for their money. Itâ€™s going to be a fun game to watch, but itâ€™s Pep Guardiolaâ€™s team thatâ€™s going to get ahold of the trophy.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
