<p>Los Angeles Lakers Going to Utah for Their 41st Win of the Season</p>
<p>The Lakers are 40-38 (.513) this season and are sitting in the No. 8 position in the West at the moment. They got three wins more than the closest team outside the Play-Ins zone (Dallas Mavericks), as well as one game fewer.</p>
<p>What this basically means is that if the Lakers win in Salt Lake City this evening, they will secure their place in the postseason. In fact, they’ll even create a chance for themselves to get to the Top 6, thus getting to the NBA Playoffs directly.</p>
<p>It would be great if they could achieve this, but doing so won’t be easy as they got some really tough opponents to face in the remainder of the season. One of those is Jazz, a team that’s desperate to win to stay in the race for the postseason.</p>
<p>Utah Jazz Need to Start Winning Again</p>
<p>The boys from Utah are 36-42 (0.468) at the moment, with two wins fewer than the team from the No. 10 position (Oklahoma City Thunder). To get to that spot and book a place in the postseason, they need to win at least another three games.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, their form just isn’t good. The Jazz are 1-6 in their last seven games, with their only win happening against one of the worst teams in the 2022-23 NBA, the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>They did come very close to winning their most recent game. It happened on the second day of the month when the Brooklyn Nets beat them by just one point.</p>
<p>Lakers vs. Jazz Prediction</p>
<p>This is a super-important game for both teams Jazz, which is why you can be 100% certain all of the players will give their utmost on the court. In such cases, it’s usually the team with the better players that wins. So, which team is better?</p>
<p>Even though the Jazz defeated the Lakers in each of their last three meetings, we do think the LA franchise is better. Considering that LeBron James and Anthony Davis are cleared to play tonight, the Lakers are bound to put on a great show this evening. They’re going to win, but it’s probably going to be a very close game.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Lakers to win, but not cover the 8-point spread</p>
