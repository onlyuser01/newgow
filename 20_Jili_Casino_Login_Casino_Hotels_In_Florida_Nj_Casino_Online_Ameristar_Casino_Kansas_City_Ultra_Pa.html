I wasn’t able to enter that responsible gaming method I have emailed them countless times at least 20 or 3010 of these emails have been priority to me we doing the funds back inside been asking to enact the responsible gaming method of a cooling off 7 to 10 day. Seven days I have written jump city gaming the owner of the site I have written the embidsen I’ve written the gaming commission regulates them all to no avail this is a very dangerous situation whereas if other players face the same fate is nothing but theft they have never ever replied to me since the gaming since they asked about a payment card and since I told him I am I able to this must be dealt with this saint must be taken to justice is a very very dangerous slope that this site has made players victimized of very dangerous because without people like you informing inform players people will just continue giving their funds and never being paid please help</p>
