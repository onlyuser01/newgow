    <h1>Best Online Casino Bonus Free Casino No Deposit Bitplay Casino Casino Party Rizk Casino Amusnet doub</h1>

<p>Amusnet has further expanded into the regulated iGaming market in Italy. The company, which is a prominent supplier of iGaming and casino products, has struck a new partnership with Microgame, which is in turn a company specializing in B2B technology for the sector, and has been a prominent bidder in the interactive casino market.</p>
<p>The tie-up allows Amusnet to considerably strengthen its own position in the market and tap into Microgame’s reliable platform to sustain momentum in the country. Microgame brings a range of 360-degree software and technology to empower companies and help them deliver outstanding experiences. In fact, the company already provides more than 50 business customers with top-notch services.</p>
<p>Amusnet Branch Director for Italy Polina Nedyalkova welcomed the opportunity to see her company expand in the market:</p>
<p>"Italy is at the focus of Amusnet as part of our strategy to expand into regulated markets. We are pleased to have extended our reach through our partnership with Microgame."</p>
<p>Amusnet for its part has plenty of worthwhile casino games to bring to bear, including 40 Super Hot, 20 Golden Coins, Shining Crown, and Amazons’ Battle. The partnership is touted as a mutually-beneficial move that will significantly strengthen the two companies’ perspectives in the market and help them amplify their respective offers.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Microgame CEO Marco Castaldo who was pleased to see another prominent partner team up with his firm and venture into the lucrative and competitive Italian iGaming landscape.</p>
<p>"Our casino, which has always been the largest in Italy, continues to grow and enrich itself with new specialities," Castaldo said, adding that Amusnet would significantly strengthen the gaming offer available by the casino. All in all, Microgame can now benefit from a more competitive and comprehensive offering moving forward.</p>
<p>Amusnet has already been shopping around in Italy, strengthening its local footprint by signing up for individual activations and partnerships with operators. One recent opportunity was realized with NetBet Italy, a prominent domestic operator which signed a content alliance with the operator to provide it with a range of games and experiences.</p>
<p>Presently, Amusnet is a company with a formidable presence in the iGaming landscape. It has created more than 240 captivating slots and engaging table games. Similarly, Amusnet offers live casino games and is currently working with more than 500 operators worldwide, across 30 licensed jurisdictions. Amusnet was formerly known as EGT Interactive before rebranding in 2022.</p>
