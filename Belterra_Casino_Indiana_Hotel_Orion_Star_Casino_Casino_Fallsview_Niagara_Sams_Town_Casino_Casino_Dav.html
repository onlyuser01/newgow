<p>Betsson Group has formed a new content alliance with Games Global, expanding on the companies' existing collaboration, and now adding live casino titles. As a result, Betsson Group will benefit from Games Global’s dedicated portfolio developed and deployed by OnAir Entertainment, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release shared with the publication.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment is an established company in the development of innovative live casino products which range from traditional live casino classics to out-of-the-box game shows. Both companies have welcomed this chance, as they see the value in continuing to push content together.</p>
<p>Games Global CRO Julie Allison welcomed the chance to once again reaffirm the strong rapport between Betsson Group and Games Global, a commitment that boils down to offering players the best possible experience which will now expand to live casino offerings.</p>
<p>"Together, we are crafting an experience that not only excites players but also sets a new standard for industry collaboration and support," Allison noted.</p>
<p>Betsson Group Live Casino Manager Chellyanne Cassar was similarly pleased with the chance to see OnAir Entertainment’s products grow with Betsson Group and bring fresh and exciting experiences to the company’s players. OnAir Entertainment’s live casino portfolio will most certainly contribute to Betsson Group’s own ambition to be seen and recognized as the home of innovative live casino products, Cassar noted.</p>
<p>Betsson Group has been very keen to scale its global alliance and work with established companies from all over the world. In a similar push over the summer, the company expanded its existing relationship with Light &amp; Wonder to benefit from the latter’s OPENGAMING System (OGS) solution and prop up its own library of titles across multiple operators.</p>
<p>Betsson Group also added content from R. Franco Digital earlier this year, seeking to further strengthen its content library with games such as Witches South, Vacuum Buster, Cyborg 30L, and many others.</p>
<p>The latest partnership with OnAir Entertainment and Games Global is similarly important, as it has expanded the available live casino offer with titles such as Travel Fever, a game show, and also traditional options, such as Auto Roulette, Blackjack, Roulette, and more.</p>
<p>Travel Fever is still in the works, but once it’s released Betsson Group will be among the first to get it and add it to its live casino libraries, giving the group a first-mover advantage.</p>
