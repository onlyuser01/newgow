    <h1>Whiskey Pete S Hotel Casino Vee Quiva Casino Casino In St Ignace Michigan Chumba Lite Fun Casino Slo</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>I signed up with 21 dukes casino and received free sign-up spins I wagered R39 000 with the free spins and end up with R1400 that I could withdraw... After the wager, I spoke to Charles at live support and I asked if the next step is a deposit which it was and I had to get verified. So, I started with my documents, first was my ID, next was proof of residence, and lastly my bank card. My ID got approved, and I could not tell if the other two documents got uploaded because it keeps showing that I need to upload these documents. I uploaded it probably 3 or 4 times. Still the same.</p>
<p>I contacted live support and was told that he could not tell me if it was uploaded to my account and he gave me the following email to find out. email - securi足ty@足21d足uke足s.com. I sent an email on the 13th of November with all my documents again and asked if they did receive them. Later I logged into my account to see if it has been approved, no reply to my email though. My proof of residence was rejected, which is very strange to me because it is from our local municipality. I searched then for contact details for 21dukes and came across another email address I sent an email to the first email address and the second one, which is support@21dukes.com.</p>
<p>The second email was sent on the 14th. No reply from them. So on the 15th, I wanted to log in to my account so I could speak to live support and my account has been disabled. I have sent 2 more emails and also no reply at all.</p>
<p>I would like to know what is going on, and why they don't reply to my emails, reject my documents, and disable my account.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
