    <h1>Cherry Jackpot Casino Casino Castle Paris Casino Parking Casino Yaamava Virgin Casino Online Nj SIS</h1>

<p>SIS has signed a new round-the-clock racing content partnership with BetConstruct, bringing input from global races to the leading global provider</p>
<p>The company is bringing its Live Racing Content to give BetConstruct the edge the platform deserves in offering some of the most entertaining content in the segment.</p>
<p>BetConstruct and SIS Bring More Value to Partners</p>
<p>BetConstruct’s partners will also stand to benefit as Sports Information Services will provide them with high-quality content from the entire world of racing, covering virtually all prominent meetups and events.</p>
<p>SIS is also happy with the opportunity as it will allow the company to further strengthen its footprint with some of the industry’s biggest and most prominent platforms.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new partnership, SIS will be able to provide BetConstruct and its extensive network of partners with an outstanding value, featuring more than 35,000 horse races and 38,000 greyhound events. The company covers 170 racecourses located on five continents.</p>
<p>SIS also brings an end-to-end solution, which means that partners get on-screen graphics, various betting triggers, markets, prices, data, and commentary, among others. SIS commercial manager for the United Kingdom and Europe Andy Kelly welcomed the new opportunity.</p>
<p>Kelly welcomed the global reach that BetConstruct has as a company and said that it is a significant step forward for SIS to be teaming up with a prominent international brand. He added:</p>
<p>It has also been a pleasure working with the BetConstruct team and I am looking forward to a long and successful partnership. SIS commercial manager for the United Kingdom and Europe Andy Kelly</p>
<p>SIS Spreads Its Presence Globally</p>
<p>Previously, the company partnered with MST to help it deliver its products in Romania where MST is working with Excelbet and its fleet of 360 retail locations. The company also launched its esports product in a second state in the United States earlier this month, with the game suite going live in Colorado.</p>
<p>Speaking of esports, SIS offers more than 180,000 events every year thanks to its Competitive Gaming product, which is certified by ESIC and features many opportunities to place a wager on the outcome of competitive video gaming.</p>
