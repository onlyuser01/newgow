<p>It’s time for Week 9 of the 2022 NFL season, and both the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs are 5-2 right now. Both teams have been playing superb football lately, but there’s one big difference between these two.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Kansas City Chiefs are putting all their hopes into their offense. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Titans’ strongest weapon this season is their defense.</p>

<p>Tennessee Titans Looking for Their Sixth Straight Win</p>
<p>After losing two straight games at the start of the 2022 NFL season, the Titans went into a beast mode. They’re currently surging on a 5-game win streak, with wins over the following teams:</p>
<p>24-22 against the Las Vegas Raiders (at home)</p>
<p>24-17 against the Indianapolis Colts (on the road)</p>
<p>21-17 against the Washington Commanders (on the road)</p>
<p>19-10 against the Indianapolis Colts (at home)</p>
<p>17-10 against the Houston Texans (on the road)</p>
<p>As you can see for yourself, the most points the Titans conceded during their superb run is 22, which happened against the Raiders. What’s interesting is that none of those teams is great passing-wise in 2022.</p>
<p>They did, however, play against one team that’s fantastic at passing – Buffalo Bills – and we saw them get thrashed 41-7 by the boys from Upstate New York.</p>
<p>Is this something that should worry the Titans ahead of their trip to Arrowhead? We think it should as the Chiefs are at least equally as good as the Titans in terms of passing.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs Have the Most Powerful Offense in the World</p>
<p>With 31.9 points per game, the Kansas City Chiefs have the most productive offense in the league. They’ve been relying on QB Patrick Mahomes’ long passes to bring them points, allowing the KC defense to be sloppy from time to time.</p>
<p>This goes especially for games against teams that are superb rushing-wise, such as their next opponent, the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>Does all this mean Tennessee’s RB Derrick Henry will wreak havoc on the Kansas City defense on Sunday evening? We sure think so, but we honestly doubt King Henry’s output will be enough to bring his team another win.</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are just way superior in the offense for the Tennessee Titans to hope for anything in Week 9. Mahomes and his deep receiving group are going to rip the Titans secondary apart. Sure, the Titans too have some amazing weapons in their offensive arsenal, but they probably won’t score enough points to get a win.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
