<p>Gaming CFOs Mostly Upbeat, Strong Dollar Could Pinch Suppliers</p>

<p>Casino industry chief financial officers (CFOs) are mostly optimistic, but a strong dollar could be a drag on other gaming companies, says a sell-side analyst.</p>

<p>In a report to clients today, Roth Capital analyst Edward Engel noted recent conversations with financial bosses of casino operators were constructive and could augur well for capital return plans in 2023.</p>
<p>Not only are gaming dividends/buy-backs at decade highs, but based on our conversations operators are pressing on with CapEx initiatives,” wrote the analyst. “We believe this creates a supportive backdrop for 2023 slot sales/placements, as well as casino floor investments like cashless gaming and tech that better captures player data/analytics.”</p>
<p>Share repurchase programs are the capital return effort of choice in the industry, as only a scant amount of casino operators restored and grew dividends following the start of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>As for demand trends, those remain sturdy, particularly on the Las Vegas Strip. Engel added North American gross gaming revenue (GGR) in August likely tracked 1% to 2% ahead of the year earlier period.</p>
<p>Supplier Recovery Is Notable</p>
<p>Among the lessons learned by casino operators amid multi-month shutdowns in 2020 is that efficiencies and margins matter. An obvious result of that is a renewed emphasis on higher margin gaming offerings – namely slot machines.</p>
<p>Now, a potentially lengthy slot upgrade cycle is underway, with possible benefits in store for suppliers such as Everi (NYSE:EVRI), Inspired Entertainment (NASDAQ:INSE), and PlayAGS (NYSE:AGS). Engel has “buy” ratings on that trio, as well as Bragg Gaming Group (NASDAQ:BRAG).</p>
<p>“Gaming suppliers have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels, where industry unit sales and installed bases have either recovered or exceeded 2019. In 2Q22, industry unit sales reached 95% of 2Q19 levels, vs a 90% recovery in 1Q22,” said the analyst. “Meanwhile, the North American installed base is +2% on a two-year basis, as new casino openings and a reacclerating replacement cycle grow the market. With CFOs remaining confident ahead of a strong pipeline of upcoming new openings/expansions, we expect further growth for gaming suppliers in 2023.”</p>
<p>Last month, Inspired Entertainment offered $10 a share in cash for AGS, valuing the target at $370 million. Those discussions ultimately fell apart.</p>
<p>Strong Dollar Headwinds</p>
<p>Thanks to five interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, with more on the way, the US dollar is clobbering other major currencies this year, and that’s a drag on companies that convert sales in greenbacks back to the currencies of their home countries.</p>
<p>As Engel points Bragg (euro) and Inspired (British pound) are among the gaming companies contending with exchange rate hurdles. He lowered his price target on Inspired to $16 from $19.</p>
<p>“Global iGaming operators reported mixed 2Q22 results; however, B2B suppliers grew alongside newly regulated markets like the US. Specifically, companies like BRAG and INSE delivered double-digit iGaming growth as they chip away market share from industry leaders. That said, FX headwinds in Europe offset some growth in 2H22 and 2023,” concluded the analyst.</p>
