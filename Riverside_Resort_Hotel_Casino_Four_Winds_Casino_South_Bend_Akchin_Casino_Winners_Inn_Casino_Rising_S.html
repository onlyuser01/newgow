    <h1>Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Four Winds Casino South Bend Akchin Casino Winners Inn Casino Rising S</h1>

<p>I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„3. REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT CREATION</p>
<p>3.1. You must register an account ("Account") with us before you can participate in any real money casino or poker games. You must be at least 18 years old in order to register an Account. We reserve the right to disable your Account and request sufficient proof of age in order to ensure that you are of legal age to access the service. If satisfactory proof of age is not provided we further reserve the right to permanently close your Account.</p>
<p>3.2. You are permitted to open only one Account. Only one account is allowed per household. Multiple accounts held by the same individual are subject to immediate closure and at our sole discretion we reserve the right to consider any balance in duplicate accounts forfeit. Furthermore you shall not permit another person to access the Website or Software via your Account without the express written permission of Ignitioncasino.eu."</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players:</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
