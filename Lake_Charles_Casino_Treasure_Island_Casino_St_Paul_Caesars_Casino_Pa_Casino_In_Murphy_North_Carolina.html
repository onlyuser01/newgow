<p>Washington Commanders vs. Dallas Cowboys is a 2023 NFL Thanksgiving game, which is taking place at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, TX, on Thursday, November 23</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys odds for the Week 12 TNF game suggest Mike McCarthy’s boys are going to destroy the visitors from the capital. Not only are the Cowboys in good form, but the Commanders are not. Dallas won four of their last five games, while Washington only has won once in the last five gameweeks.</p>
<p>What’s giving Washington fans some confidence is that their boys obliterated their NFC East rivals 26-6 the last time they met.</p>

<p>Spread Odds Washington Commanders -110 Dallas Cowboys -110</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Washington Commanders +430 Dallas Cowboys -600</p>

<p>Dallas Cowboys Determined to Keep on Winning</p>
<p>The Cowboys are 7-32 on the season, which puts them in third place in the NFC. However, they’re second in their conference. It’s the Philadelphia Eagles who sit top of the NFC East. Mike McCarthy and his men would like to overtake that spot, but that won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Actually, even booking a wild card playoff spot could prove challenging. Why? Because their schedule is to get ugly real soon. The thing is that in December, they’ll play against some real heavyweights – the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>It’s gonna be hard to win even one of those four games. That’s why it’s of utmost importance for Dallas to collect wins against easier opponents like Washington.</p>
<p>What’s Going on With Sam Howell?</p>
<p>After a kind of rough start to the season, Washington’s second-year quarterback Sam Howell did pretty well in October. He continued playing well in November, but then he had a disastrous performance against the New York Giants last weekend.</p>
<p>We saw him throw for one touchdown while getting three of his passes intercepted. Further, he also got sacked four times by the Giants’ defense. The result was that his team ended up losing 31-19 despite entering the game as an 8-point favorite.</p>
<p>The Commanders really needed a win in that game in order to stay in the competition for a wild card entry to the postseason. They’re currently 4-7 with some really tough matchups coming their way. In five of their six remaining games of the 2023 NFL season, they’re taking on a team that’s currently over .500.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders vs. Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>The Commanders know that getting to the playoffs is a mission impossible for them at this point. That’s why they probably won’t be too fired up in the Thursday Night football game. They also don’t have much confidence after the disappointing loss to the Giants in the previous round.</p>
<p>Everything’s almost the opposite when it comes to the Cowboys. These guys are super-motivated to win, and they’ve got the confidence to pull it off. But even if all that wasn’t true, they’d still be favored to win the Thanksgiving game. Why? Because they simply have a much better roster than the Commanders.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread</p>
