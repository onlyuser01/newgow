<p>TrueLab and Yggdrasil have introduced their third game for the YG Masters program. Viking Runes takes players on a thrilling journey in the lives of the Vikings.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Takes You on a Raid with TrueLab’s Viking Runes</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and TrueLab have teamed up for another dedicated slot adventure taking you to the world of Vikings and introducing you to their customs of pillaging, plundering, and raiding distant lands. Whether you are a Loki or an Odin player, Viking Runes has been designed to guarantee a maximum amount of fun, built to fit the YG Masters original distribution network.</p>
<p>This is the third title TrueLab and Yggdrasil have collaborated on through the YG Masters program. The platform allows operators to access a pre-configured product that meets local regulation and comes with a cutting-edge implementation solution that makes it ready to play, all courtesy of the GATI technology underpinning the entire platform.</p>
<p>TrueLab chief business development officer Vasily Polynov has welcomed the opportunity for yet another fruitful partnership between TrueLab and Yggdrasil, arguing that Viking Runes comes with a “staggering win potential, triggerable features on every cascade and an immersive landscape.”</p>
<p>A Journey in the Day of the Vikings: Features and Payouts</p>
<p>The cluster pay mechanics adds a few twists to the experience and the potential to win the whopping 25,000x calculated on your base bet. All you need is six or more identical symbols in the cluster drop.</p>
<p>To make things even better, Yggdrasil and TrueLab let you score multiple winnings if you hit the right symbols in the clusters. Moreover, clusters are removed in cascading fashion to lead to even more potential winnings.</p>
<p>Should you bring Lighting Wilds on the reels on any of the spins, you can fill in for a missing symbol and even get Runic Shuffle to swap symbol positions randomly for a shot at another win.</p>
<p>More features enhance the player experience with Viking Runes making good use of Spell of Ancestors to transform all paying symbols into the Red Rune, which could unlock some of the juiciest prizes in the game.</p>
<p>Trigger Viking Sorcery, and you will get up to nine Lighting Wilds neatly stacked up on your reels. This can be triggered once per cascade. Should you get five or more cascades on a single spin, you will enter the Free Spins mode, which comes with more Lighting Wilds and progressive multipliers, leading to some potentially big rewards.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, head of partner programs Stuart McCarthy, welcomed the addition of Viking Runes to the YG Masters’ family. He lauded the cascading wins imbuing the experience for consumers and the thrilling theme that “adds a fantastic new dynamic to the portfolio.” Previously, Yggdrasil and TrueLab partnered for the ‘Christmas Tree’ festive slot.</p>
