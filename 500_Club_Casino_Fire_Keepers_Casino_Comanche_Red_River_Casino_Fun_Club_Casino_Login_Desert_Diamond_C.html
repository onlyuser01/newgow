<p>Can Daniil Medvedev Stage an Upset in New York?</p>
<p>Daniil Medvedev has made it to the final of the 2023 US Open after beating one of the top pre-tournament favorites, Carlos Alcaraz. He did it in four sets after nearly three and a half hours on the court.</p>

<p>Before that, he defeated Andrey Rublev in three sets but still had to spend just under three hours on the court under an open roof. He complained about this, saying that it’s made him exhausted.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s a big question of whether he’s too jaded to do anything against Djokovic in the final. Whether he is or not, his destiny isn’t really in his hands. It’s all about how Djokovic performs on Sunday.</p>
<p>Djokovic Making Another Statement Toward the GOAT Status</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic is the man who’s won more Grand Slam tournaments than anyone else in history. He’s also won three US Open tournaments and has a chance to even the record of his archrival Rafael Nadal if he wins on Sunday. On top of that, he’s getting to the No. 1 spot in the ATP Rankings regardless of what happens in the 2023 US Open final.</p>
<p>Knowing how good he is, it’s no surprise that bookies think of him as the favorite to win in Sunday’s match. However, he’s got some bad memories from the US Open. Last year, he was denied entry to America on the grounds of refusing to get vaccinated. A year before, he lost 3-0 to Medvedev in the final, and in 2020, the Serbian got defaulted after hitting a lineswoman with the ball.</p>
<p>In fact, the last good memory he has of this tournament is when he won it in 2018. It’s been five years since he’s won the US Open the last time, is that too long a wait for the GOAT?</p>
<p>Medvedev vs. Djokovic Prediction</p>
<p>Medvedev did beat Djokovic the last time they met in the US Open, but we’re almost 100% certain the same won’t happen again. On September 10, it’s Djokovic who’s going to triumph. It’s just that in 2023, he’s the best player in the world, and Medvedev is nowhere near him.</p>
<p>Pick: Novak Djokovic to win</p>
