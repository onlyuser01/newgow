<p>The platform is further elevated by a selection of live dealer games provided by Visionary Gaming. Players will similarly discover tight KYC and AML policies in place, adding to the overall safety of the site.</p>
<p>Red Dog Casino puts a big emphasis on player protection and transparency. US players will find this casino to be a spot-on option if they are looking for safe and reliable gameplay and would not mind topping that up with a strong bonus to get them on their feet.</p>
<p>There is a lot that this iGaming platform has to offer you. The casino has a substantial player base of over 2,500 active players around the clock with numerous bonuses, great RTPs, and an immersive mobile experience. Let’s find out more.</p>
<p>Red Dog Casino Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>Promotions and bonuses play a big part in the offer you will find at Red Dog Casino. The operator is fully dedicated to providing outstanding promos that will get you going from the start and help you build up your bankroll.</p>
<p>Red Dog Casino similarly extends numerous promotions that focus on seasonal and daily incentives that will fit the time of the year and give you thematic power-ups to improve your experience. Let’s take a look at what bonuses are available.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>The welcome bonus at Red Dog Casino is designed to offer a quick gameplay boost. You deposit $10 in USD or $20 in Bitcoin to claim a massive 225% bonus that applies to your first FIVE deposits.</p>
<p>This makes for a massive $12,250 in total bonus money or $2,450 in deposit money for each individual deposit you make. You have to enter the WAGGINTAILS bonus code to activate the bonus.</p>
<p>The playthrough requirement here is 35x which is pretty good, although a bit higher than the 30x that is usually associated with a deposit bonus most of the time. This aside, the maximum bet per round you can make is $10, and that makes the bonus so much more flexible to play through.</p>
<p>No Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>For those of you who are just starting out, Red Dog Casino will provide you with a $40 no deposit bonus that will prove a great way to top up your bankroll when you are only just finding your bearings.</p>
<p>To get this bonus, remember to punch in FREERED as your bonus code and just like that, the casino will provide you with a great starter’s bonus. Bonus codes play a big part in the way the rewards system works at Red Dog Casino so make sure not to miss out on those.</p>
<p>New Game Bonus, 24/7 Bonus, and More</p>
<p>There is a constant stream of new bonuses to explore, which makes the casino so much more fun to play at. You will never have a dull moment with Red Dog Casino’s offer of freebies that come as bonus cash, free spins, and deposit top-ups based on the payment option you use.</p>
<p>The casino seems to give a bit of an edge to Neosurf and Bitcoin users – make sure to always check out the bonus details to see if certain payment methods grant you larger bonuses. There are more promos to scope out and you can do so on the dedicated casino page at your own leisure.</p>
