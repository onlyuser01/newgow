<p>GeoComply has been selected by A5 as a partner to help the latter provide the necessary anti-cheat and anti-fraud solutions for one of its clients, namely the World Poker Tour (WPT). Specifically, the partnership covers the online poker arm of the company, WPT Global.</p>
<p>WPT Global is an online poker site that launched in May 2022 and has been expanding its global reach over the past year. The company boasts some 15,000 active daily users on average, with peak times around big tournaments and events easily doubling these numbers.</p>
<p>The site already operates in more than 50 countries and is looking to expand further. A5 has been an important part of this expansion, as the company has worked hard to ensure that players are protected from cheaters. To this end, A5 has deployed an array of solutions that utilize data science and machine learning to deliver results.</p>
<p>As a further step towards the strengthening of the online poker room’s platform, A5 has turned to GeoComply which will, in turn, help A5 and WPT Global protect the website from bot groups and other fraudulent activities. GeoComply will also deploy its geo-fencing solutions designed specifically to prevent players from accessing WPT Global from geolocations that are currently prohibited under the website’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>GeoComply has been particularly successful in protecting newly-regulated and launched markets in North America, ensuring that individuals from unauthorized locations may not connect bet, play, or gamble at a website in breach of its gambling license. GeoComply VP Sales and Customer Experience Mark Blunden was particularly happy with the new opportunity, and said:</p>
<p>"We are delighted to support and protect A5 Labs as it rolls out its operations around the world. Our technology has been road tested in North America’s highly regulated markets and will provide A5 Labs with the protection it needs across the globe."</p>
<p>The new collaboration was naturally welcomed by A5 Labs Head of Security John Andress. Andress said that WPT Global is now embarking on the ambitious task of eliminating all sorts of cheating from its platform, as the online portal is experiencing a time of rapid growth across the board.</p>
<p>"Investing in GeoComply’s market-leading technology will keep us one step ahead of the cheats no matter where they are based," Andress explained, as a nod to the company.</p>
