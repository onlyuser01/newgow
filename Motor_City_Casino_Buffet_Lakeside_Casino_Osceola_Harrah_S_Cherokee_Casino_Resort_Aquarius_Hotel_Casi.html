<p>The state of Colorado is lifting casino restrictions in Black Hawk, Cripple Creek and Central City casinos and introducing new games and higher betting limits.</p>
<p>Colorado’s Casino Welcome Higher Betting Limits</p>
<p>Colorado is preparing to lift a ream of restrictions that have to do with casino gambling operations. Starting from Saturday, May 1 the state will enjoy per-basis betting limits set by the gambling establishments in the three casino towns, to name Black Hawk, Cripple Creek, and Central City.</p>
<p>This is made possible by Amendment 77 which was voted on during the November 2020 ballot and allowed Colorado’s residents to decide on whether they want gambling and betting limits lifted and more games added at casino floors across the Centennial State.</p>
<p>Passing with overwhelming support, the Amendment is now set to give Colorado a much-needed boost following the COVID-19 pandemic, which bit into the state’s economy and opened а wide budget deficit.</p>
<p>Casinos in all three cities are now planning to add new games that will allow customers to experience new forms of entertainment and hopefully attract new crowds. “Lifting the betting limits and adding the full complement of casino games brings a whole new dynamic to the City of Black Hawk,” said city mayor David Spellman.</p>
<p>The addition of new games should prove tempting for Denver metro area customers who have been coming out to Black Hawk in greater numbers, commented the mayor. The changes will impact the variety of games and create a more vibrant and beneficial overall industry.</p>
<p>Originally only blackjack, slot machines, and poker were allowed when the three casino towns received the state’s approval to run gambling businesses in 1991, but they have since expanded to feature roulette and craps games.</p>
<p>New Games Arriving in Colorado</p>
<p>The most recent actualization of the gambling framework allows the cities to further add numerous baccarat titles, versions of pai gow poker, keno, and some more exclusive gaming titles, such as Five Treasures and Big Six Wheel.</p>
<p>Baccarat should prove a huge hit with customer bases as the game will be a new experience for them. Not only that, but with the addition of more viable games and products, Colorado residents won’t have a reason to travel to Las Vegas and get the type of gaming they have been looking for all along.</p>
<p>Colorado definitely has an inherent interest in keeping as much gambling revenue as possible within the state’s borders. The state’s casinos have generated an estimated $18 billion in revenue since they launched in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Incentivizing customers to stay in Colorado or even visit from elsewhere through the addition of new games and liberalizing the existing sector is a good way to make sure this number continues to grow steadily.</p>
