<p>OnAir Entertainment and MrQ have inked a new partnership to offer live casino gaming and create innovation-driven solutions</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment, the global innovator of choice for tailored live casino gaming with 200 years of collective experience, has announced a new agreement with MrQ, known as the quickest-developing online casino in the UK.</p>
<p>The Agreement Marks an Important Milestone for Both Parties</p>
<p>The fresh partnership will support both companies in their endeavor to completely change the current face of the iGaming industry while relying on a series of innovative solutions.</p>
<p>MrQ will mix its customer-focused options with OnAir Entertainment’s rich experience in creating fully customized environments for players. This way, both parties expect to generate unparalleled gaming experiences that will exceed players’ expectations.</p>
<p>Besides a series of iconic classic games of Roulette and Blackjack, MrQ customers will get access to highly-acclaimed OnAir Entertainment titles, including Card Matchup and Nexus Roulette.</p>
<p>MrQ’s gaming operations manager, Aaron Braund, explained that their company was constantly interested in improving players’ experiences by providing “the very best in gaming content.”</p>
<p>Braund also mentioned the shared passion for technology and quality customer experiences of both companies, which simplified their decision to embark on the new journey alongside OnAir Entertainment.</p>
<p>As a result of the new agreement, Braund further added that they anticipate even more growth in their live casino vertical while looking forward to “a prosperous partnership.”</p>
<p>At the same time, James Jones, OnAir Entertainment’s chief commercial officer, expressed similar enthusiasm and thrills regarding the collaboration that mixes the power of their immersive games with their new partner’s commitment to “revolutionizing the online gaming landscape.”</p>
<p>Jones further explained they were looking forward to pushing the boundaries of the current standards in the online gaming industry as well as players’ experiences to whole new levels.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment, Led by Senior Industry Pros</p>
<p>The 2020-founded company is currently led by a collective of senior pros in the casino industry with long expertise in live casinos. Their fast growth rates helped the studio with headquarters in Malta to reach new European markets by expanding in Latvia and Romania.</p>
<p>With the help of an unrivaled market and customer reach with the help of their Games Global platform, OnAir Entertainment is determined to become the leader of the industry in the live casino space while continuing to inspire customers and engage players. The company reiterated its global expansion plans via localized content in March.</p>
<p>MrQ Offers Unique Entertainment</p>
<p>MrQ was launched in August 2018 by Lindar Media with the purpose of breathing fresh life into the online bingo universe. Now, the platform is aimed at providing casino players with exactly what they are looking for: zero-nonsense entertainment and a clear focus on fair gaming experiences.</p>
<p>With their no-wagering requirements, cash winnings, and quick withdrawals, the casino has attracted a large number of players in the UK.</p>
<p>Its future plans are based on its creed to always look “for ways to change the game, creating better experiences” for players while using the spiciest technology possible.</p>
<p>Last November, MrQ and Push Gaming announced they secured an agreement that would allow the operator to gain full access to the supplier’s award-winning titles.</p>
