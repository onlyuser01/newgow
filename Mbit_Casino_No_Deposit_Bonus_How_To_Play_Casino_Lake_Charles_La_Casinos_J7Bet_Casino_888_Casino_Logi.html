<p>Dear Εγη,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked with a live chat agent. Please see below the transcript:</p>
<p>"Hi, I found this in your T&amp;Cs https://www.betchaser.com/terms-conditions:</p>
<p>With the first request for a withdrawal the User must enter valid passport or Personal ID details, exactly as it appears on the document, in the language of the country that issued (or in the case of foreign documents – in English)."</p>
<p>If a document is in Greek, I need to translate it to English? Thank you</p>
<p>Hello. Thank you for contacting me.</p>
<p>Excuse me, all the document is in Greek , there is no English version of the details ?</p>
<p>Geek only :(</p>
<p>Please hold on a moment</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting , unfortunately it's not acceptable , it should be in English as well</p>
<p>and it can be translated or translated and verified? What would be accepted?</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting , please be informed that if it's a formal translation it can be accepted</p>
<p>formal translation, meaning Apostille too or notary only?</p>
<p>Please upload it with a formal translation and it will be checked by the relevant team.</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mike for your help"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you need to translate the documents and upload them to verify your account. Please let us know if this advice was helpful or we need to intervene. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
