<p>Are you ready to go back in time and live the mesmerizing pinup diner experience in the ‘50s? Keep an eye on DragonGaming’s freshest release, American Diner. The new video slot with five spinning reels on three rows has been designed with this exact theme in mind. It doesn’t get any more American than this in the new game created by the same talented team that made its first game 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Celebrate the ‘50s With American Diner!</p>
<p>American Diner is packed with celebratory symbols and design elements that throw the 1950s decade into the spotlight. The symbols range from jukeboxes, roller skates, Cadillac cars, and coffee machines as high-paying symbols and the standard A, K, Q, and J cards as low-paying symbols designed with diner food themes. To win, players must match the themed symbols across the ten available paylines. The paylines pay from left to right.</p>
<p>The waitress, which is also the wild symbol, and the bonus symbol attract bigger wins, so make sure to keep a close eye on them. A maximum of three bonus symbols popping on the reels bring players the opportunity to get their hands on an expanding walking wild with a cool multiplier. The expanding walking wild feature can be triggered at a random time when it can spawn an expanding wild in the form of a waitress carrying a diner order on the leftmost reel. Every time a new re-spin occurs, the same waitress is seen majestically roller skating onto the next reel. At the same time, the multiplier is seen incrementally going up. The game also features a scatter symbol in the form of the neon bonus sign.</p>
