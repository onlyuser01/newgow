    <h1>Harrah S Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Oklahoma Casino Map M Resort And Casino Free Casino Games No Dep</h1>

<p>I had a phone conversation yesterday with Ducky Luck support - they are adamant that I played through all of my money - I think their tactic was to reverse one withdrawal and also take my play balance and then put it back to explain that I played through all of my money. - I do have to say, those are good tactics!</p>
<p>I did follow up to them with this email...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$2500 was wired to my credit union in WA State on 04/18, which I received</p>
<p>$500 withdrawal has never been paid out to me</p>
<p>Another $2500 was requested as a withdrawal</p>
<p>I got an email that I had reversed the $2500 withdrawal, which I did not, and could not as it was in a state of "Completed"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I contacted support and I re-requested the $2500 withdrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I am waiting for the $500 and the $2500 withdrawals.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a VIP host sent me an email that they provided $1000 free chips in my account (I will forward that email)</p>
<p>While waiting for my withdrawals, I played the $1000 up to $3250, but the next morning my play balance was only $750</p>
<p>I reached out to support and the $2500 was put back into my play balance</p>
<p>Now I am still waiting for the $500 and the $2500 withdrawals</p>
<p>Although I met the wagering requirements for the $3250 form the $1000 free coins, I purposely played the $’s to zero, as I knew I would have to stress about getting those $’s out as well as the $500 and $2500, and I just want my money so I can have closure to this nightmare</p>
<p>I called support to check on my $500 and $2500 withdrawals, and was told by Drake, a VIP host, that I had $8000 in approved withdrawals - $500, $2500, $2500, and $2500</p>
<p>What those $’s are….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$500 – still owed to me</p>
<p>$2500 – still owed to me</p>
<p>$2500 – MAYBE Ducky Luck added back the withdrawal that they reversed, but I already re-requested that withdrawal</p>
<p>$2500 – MAYBE the money taken from my play balance and then added back to my play balance</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I am back waiting for the $500 and the $2500 withdrawals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that Ducky Luck will not wire again to my WA credit union, but I need them reversed so I can request paper checks mailed to my WY home. Only $2500 that was taken from my play balance and then added back to my play balance was played through. This has NOTHING to do with my original $500 and $2500 withdrawal requests. If I had access to my daily balances, you would see that $5000 - my $2500 withdrawal owed to me AND the $2500 that was taken and then added back to my play balance was NOT played through - ONLY the $3250 that I won from the $1000 free coins.</p>
<p>I will not let this go as I am 100% correct - and your system has been changing my withdrawals and play balance without my permission. This is 100% unethical... JustJeanna Jeanna Boscia</p>
