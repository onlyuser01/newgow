<p>Porfirio Duarte-Herrera, 42, broke out of Southern Desert Correctional Center on Friday, where he was held since being convicted for the 2007 murder of a man at the Luxor.</p>
<p>To force open his cell window, he spilled acid on the area near the window casing, KLAS, a local TV station, reported. He then climbed out through the open window. He left a cardboard dummy in the cell to mislead guards.</p>
<p>Duarte-Herrera then made his way over a barbed-wire fence, KLAS revealed. Eventually, he fled from Indian Springs, Nev., the prison’s location, and made his way some 45 miles to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Someone in the area recognized him. His photo and description had been widely disseminated by the media.</p>

<p>Officers stopped Duarte-Herrera after he had bought a bus ticket to Mexico, US Marshal for Nevada Gary Schofield told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>It is believed that he was wearing a black baseball cap, blue shirt, and blue shorts for part of the way. He had a blue backpack with him and was carrying a coat he had sewed in a class at the prison, according to KLAS.</p>
<p>Even though he escaped on Friday, prison guards only realized Duarte-Herrara was missing as of Tuesday morning. Then, on Tuesday evening, the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) confirmed he escaped from the penitentiary on Friday evening.</p>
<p>News of the escape and the reporting apparently infuriated Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D). He wants those responsible to “be held accountable.”</p>
<p>So far, it is unclear if prison guards were lax in guarding him, and there’s been no word on if he had any help in his escape.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, before his capture, federal officials upped the reward for his arrest from $5,000 to $30,000.</p>
<p>Duarte-Herrera is an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, the Washington Times reported.</p>
<p>Murder Plot</p>
<p>Duarte-Herrera has been incarcerated at the prison since 2010, He was convicted for the murder of Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio at the Luxor casino. Antonio was killed after a pipe bomb exploded on the Luxor Hotel &amp; Casino’s parking garage roof.</p>
<p>Duarte-Herrera and a second defendant, Omar Rueda-Denvers, were convicted of murder by use of a deadly weapon and attempted murder by use of a deadly weapon in connection with the incident.</p>
<p>Duarte-Herrera was sentenced to life in prison without any options for parole.</p>

<p>The bomb was hidden in a coffee cup that was placed on top of the victim’s car, the Las Vegas Sun said. The bomb had a motion-activated trigger that was activated when Dorantes Antonio picked up the cup, authorities revealed. He was unaware the explosive device was inside.</p>
<p>Dorantes Antonio’s right hand was seriously injured from the explosion. A piece of metal also got lodged in his head, the Sun reported. His then-girlfriend, Caren Chali, was standing near the car at the time, but wasn’t hurt in the explosion.</p>
<p>Chali was Rueda-Denvers’ former girlfriend. The two had a daughter together, reports said. Rueda-Denvers was jealous of the new relationship between her and Dorantes Antonio, prosecutors revealed during the trial.</p>
<p>Prosecutors sought the death penalty for the two defendants. But both got life sentences without any chance of parole.</p>
<p>In 2019, a federal judge granted Rueda-Denvers a new trial because of improper court procedures. In a retrial last year, he was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and other charges.</p>
