<p>Lottery ticket retailer Jackpocket officially announced its participation in 2022’s Gift Responsibly Campaign. The project aims to raise awareness regarding the risks of gifting lottery tickets to minors, rallying community organizations and lotteries worldwide behind its cause. Jackpocket is a long-time supporter of the campaign and is well-regarded for its responsible gaming efforts.</p>
<p>The Campaign Seeks To Prevent Youth Gambling</p>
<p>This year’s Gift Responsibly Campaign was possible thanks to the efforts of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and the McGill University-based International Center for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors. 2022’s campaign received support from hundreds of organizations helping educate communities on the dangers of gifting lottery tickets to children and the associated risks of youth gambling.</p>
<p>2022’s campaign has enjoyed significant participation from American, Canadian, and European Lotteries and dozens of non-lottery organizations worldwide. Many partners have pledged to contribute with radio and TV ads, digital media content, and in-store signage to spread the initiative’s powerful message.</p>
<p>According to the campaign organizers, youth gambling has become a significant and growing public health issue, which is why the participation of such high-profile organizations was vital to ensure their warnings reached as many people as possible. Jackpocket is the pioneer official third-party lottery ticket app in the USA, so its contribution will be a substantial boon to the cause. NCPG Executive Director Keith Whyte lauded the company’s enduring support and used the opportunity to reiterate the campaign’s motto.</p>
<p>We applaud Jackpocket’s commitment to raising awareness about risks of youth gambling. Our message is a simple one: lottery tickets are never appropriate gifts for children. Keith Whyte, NCPG Executive Director</p>
<p>The NCPG bases its warnings on several studies on the impact of lottery tickets on children. The worrying results indicated that early exposure could result in problem gambling tendencies later in life, and said exposure could be seemingly innocuous, like gifting your child a scratch ticket.</p>
<p>Jackpocket Is a Strong Proponent of Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>Jackpocket has earned a reputation for its stalwart commitment to player protection. The company was the first third-party lottery retailer to receive NCPG’s responsible gambling certification due to its focus on implementing features promoting responsible play. Users can set daily deposit and spend limits, use self-exclusion options, and easily access safe gaming information and assistance.</p>
<p>Jackpocket founder and CEO Peter Sullivan reaffirmed the company’s stance on problem gambling, promoting a safe and sustainable business model benefiting players and operators alike.</p>
<p>We are proud to stand with the NCPG in raising awareness that lottery tickets and scratch-offs are appropriate gifts for adults only. Peter Sullivan, Jackpocket founder and CEO</p>
<p>Sullivan noted that while the campaign only lasted throughout the holiday season, its message applied year-round. The company has a foothold in 13 states after its most recent expansion, making its voice a vital part of conveying the campaign’s message.</p>
