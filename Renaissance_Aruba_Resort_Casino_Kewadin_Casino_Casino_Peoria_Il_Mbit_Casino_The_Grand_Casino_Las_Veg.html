<p>One Year after the Pandemic Hit, Las Vegas Is Ready to Start Its Recovery</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there hasn’t been an industry that did not feel the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the world, the pandemic hit the hardest. Last year, the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19 led to the temporary closure of the hotels and casinos. Although some operators kept their employees on furlough, others have chosen to lay off a part of their workforce.</p>
<p>Now, more than a year since the pandemic started, it seems that the gambling industry is about to start its recovery. Evidence that confirms this is that more people can find jobs as card dealers in casinos. Furthermore, more people are interested in enrolling in dealer schools.</p>
<p>Although there is an uptick in the interest toward a career as a card dealer, the Silver State remains cautious until more casino employees receive COVID-19 vaccines. The casino venues are allowed to operate, but currently, a 50% capacity restriction is in place.</p>
<p>More People Enrolling in Card Dealer Schools</p>
<p>According to David Noll, managing director of the CEG Dealer School in Las Vegas, who spoke with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, during the pandemic, his business found jobs for more than 140 dealers. Furthermore, he acknowledged that for most of them, this was “their very first job“. Besides new employees, Noll indicated that some of the students that are enrolling in school have previously worked in hotel-casinos taking positions such as housekeepers, dishwashers, and other helping staff.</p>
<p>While some of the students have decided to make a move, changing their careers, others are building on their experience. According to Noll, many students are looking to boost their competitiveness by learning more games. An example that he gave is that blackjack-only dealers are seeing that they can be more competitive by learning more games.</p>
<p>Crescent School of Gaming and Bartending owner, Ricky Richard, spoke to the Las Vegas Review-Journal and said that his students are successfully hired in casinos in Clark County. Furthermore, he added that this is “the most fast and furious recovery” he has ever seen. Richard acknowledged that currently, there is a strong demand for card dealers.</p>
