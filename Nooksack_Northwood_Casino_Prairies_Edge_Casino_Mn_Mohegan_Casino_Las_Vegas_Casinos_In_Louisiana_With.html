<p>The Super Bowl’s ad spots have been desired airtime, but one that costs more than a pretty penny. At the cost of around$6 million for a 30-second spot, there aren’t many companies who are convinced that this is the best way to spend their money on marketing. DraftKings, though, wants to believe, and they remain the sole betting agency that has ponied up the money for an ad spot.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl LVI set for February 13 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, will feature a DraftKings segment, and the company will be the only sports betting operator in the United States to have decided to buy airtime during the Big Game.</p>
<p>DraftKings has not been timid in seeking to add more customers. The company spent $1.2 billion in 2021 alone on various marketing strategies, from free bets to various promo contests, and is now prepared to cough up $6.5 million for its 30-second segment in February.</p>
<p>Whether this gambit pays off is a matter of careful market research, although the best way to determine that is to take historical data. DraftKings has also been preparing for this year’s airtime based on past experience. It previously launched two 15-second ads during Super Bowl LV. Apparently, DraftKings believes that consolidating the segments into one this time around may be better.</p>
<p>Bringing Third-Party Expertise in Creating the Latest Ad</p>
<p>The new ad will be aired during the first quarter and has been produced with the help of VaynerMedia, a creative agency. This means that DraftKings has decided to tap into third-party expertise instead of relying on just its own marketing team.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is always a cause for celebration. While truly nerve-biting games have been a rare sight these last years, there is still a lot to do and see at the Super Bowl. If not watching the DraftKings ad, then you may get to enjoy the company of Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, and others at half-time.</p>
<p>With a lot of pocket cash to spend on advertising, DraftKings is going to be looking forward to the marketing impact its ad would have. In the meantime, media and sports betting are edging closer together.</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated launched the SI Sportsbook in Colorado last year, positioning the media as both a source of sports insights and news and an active player in the betting space. The New York Times confirmed the acquisition of The Athletic earlier in January, with the media ensuring that it’s looking to have its toes in sports gambling and sports coverage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it will be a busy weekend ahead for NFL sports fans and bettors as the Rams will meet the Buccaneers, the Bengals will go up against the Titans, and the 49ers will face off with the Packers.</p>
