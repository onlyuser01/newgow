<p>The leading provider of top iGaming content has prepared a captivating fishing adventure slot with scatters, free spins, multipliers, and instant cash prizes.

<p>Join the Underwater Ancient Egypt Kingdom</p>
<p>The game is packed with vividly colored graphics and bright design elements found in an animated backdrop that introduces players to the underwater kingdom. Here, players will come across pyramids and different riches.</p>
<p>The game’s soundtrack completed the beautiful Egyptian theme for a fully immersive mood and gameplay atmosphere.</p>
<p>The developer also paid a lot of attention when designing the 13 available game symbols. The basic symbols are represented by card values, scarabs, cheetahs, eagles, and Eye of Horus symbols. These symbols pay once they land on any location on the reels.</p>
<p>The game also features Scatters responsible for triggering the activate Free Spins round when a minimum of three lands on the reels, and a Collector symbol that scoops up values of all fish money symbols while ushering in more free spins.</p>
<p>The game also displays Money symbols that bring players various cash prizes and Remover symbols that work as expected by removing the lowest value currency available for fish money symbols.</p>
<p>Massive 20000x Win Potential</p>
<p>To win, players must create matching combos of symbols across the ten available paylines. Landing a minimum of four Fish symbols will attract instant cash prizes.</p>
<p>Players can also consult the section above the board and see all the multipliers they can climb for each new fish they land during a new spin. In total, there are 15 fish dispersed across all reels, with a massive 2000x multiplier potential.</p>
<p>The Malta-based provider that has been developing top games since 2015 also allows players to land a minimum of three scatters to enter the free spins round. More scatter symbols will award additional free spins.</p>
<p>During the free spins round, players can exclusively collect the fish symbols with the help of a Pharaoh symbol. At least four Pharaoh symbols are needed to unlock a retrigger round.</p>
<p>The Cleopatra symbol works by removing the lowest fish prize from the progressive meter and giving players an additional spin. Landing a pair of Cleopatra symbols during a single spin eliminates the two lowest symbols while awarding three more spins.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Pragmatic Play expanded its presence in the Swiss market with the help of Grand Casino Bern. Last December, the company announced similar growth deals for Brazil with the help of JK Bet and BetBastet partnerships.</p>
