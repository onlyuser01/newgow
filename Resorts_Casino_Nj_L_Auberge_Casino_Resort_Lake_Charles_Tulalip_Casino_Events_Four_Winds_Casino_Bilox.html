<p>Stats Perform, a sports content giant, and LaLiga, the Spanish topflight soccer league, have announced an extension to their partnership. This new long-term collaboration will seek to bring more worthwhile experiences to sports fans and bettors who are interested in leveraging quality live streams and official data to make decisions and engage with their favorite sport. The deal will be active until 2028.</p>
<p>Partnership to Serve Fans, Bettors, and LaLiga</p>
<p>Under the terms of this new partnership, Stats Perform can exclusively collect and manage live official data along with player statistics for all 800 LaLiga matches each season. This will help both companies as Stats Perform has an inherent interest in data and LaLiga will further benefit by having its brand popularized.</p>
<p>LaLiga’s data will be used with global broadcasts, publishers, sportsbooks, fantasy providers, and others to amplify the league’s standing. Stats Perform sees in this move a confirmation of the power of its data platform Opta, which is a go-to option for men’s and women’s professional football scores and player stats. Opta already works with four out of the big leagues, Stats Perform notes.</p>
<p>Stats Perform CCO Alex Rice welcomed the opportunity and said that the new deal demonstrated LaLiga’s commitment to further growing its global appeal with fans and audiences. Rice added:</p>
<p>We’re delighted and proud to be able to continue to bring such a high level of sports entertainment to our global media and betting partners and their customers. Stats Perform CCO Alex Rice</p>
<p>LaLiga director of audiovisual Melcior Sole was similarly thrilled to see this new partnership form. “Stats Perform’s unrivaled collection expertise, distribution, and famous Opta brand means quality experiences for LaLiga fans and bettors,” Sole explained. He further praised Stats Perform’s focus on innovation and AI and said that thanks to the company’s solutions, LaLiga could connect with global audiences in new ways.</p>
<p>Stats Perform was most recently named an official partner to the Rugby League World Cup, serving as a data provider. The company also expanded its partnership with the Polish PKO BP Ekstraklasa as the data provider continues to grow its footprint across Europe.</p>
