    <h1>Hard Rock Casino In Tampa Florida Baccarat Casino Game Twin River Casino Rhode Island Stations Casin</h1>

<p>Hi and thank you for your help! I'm so devastated by all this.</p>
<p>I've attached the message from Tortuga agent Alexis, which was sent around a month after my withdrawal issue.</p>
<p>There were no red flags about their site until I wasn't getting the withdrawal &amp; I began going to 'chat' to find out why it's taking so long. Even the female chat rep said it was weird. Right after my conversation with her my account was blocked due to 'self exclusion'?!.</p>
<p>So what they're saying is I opened an account, deposited $225 and when I won $1114.80 and tried to withdraw I couldn't. In other words I simply gave them $225 then after I won I wanted my account blocked by self exclusion???? Nobody answered my questions, I was getting only automatic replies ... I finally got a reply from Ross/rep on Jan 16, 2023:</p>

<p>I never ever said I had gambling issues , I simply made reference to the many people that go to these sites to win money. For me it was Christmas, I was alone &amp; only thing I could think of to do for leisure/enjoyment. I don't even know how I got their advertisement! I surely didn't go looking to gamble!</p>
<p>Ross is saying, they can't help me Jan 16, then Alexis is saying on Jan 20 that there were issues with deposit into my account &amp; their financial department would deal with it and contact me soon.</p>
<p>I'm a 68 year old single senior lady with disabilities, I don't go anywhere due to those disabilities I opened the account that day for leisure &amp; would've never gone back ... I just want them to keep their promise. Their ratings are good, I thought they were trust worthy?! I deposited with the promise of them paying me my winnings!!</p>
<p>Please help me, I'm so exhausted with this.</p>
<p>at this point, they're not even replying to my emails.</p>
<p>It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from ... I'm so devastated. PLEASE HELP ME!!</p>
<p>I am so appreciative for your help in this matter. Thank you.</p>
