<p>Starting this summer, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City plans to offer chartered flights for high-end clientele.</p>

<p>In a press release, the casino announced the service would start on July 16. Ultimate Jet Charters will operate the service, using a 30-seat Dornier 328 jet.</p>
<p>We are confident that Hard Rock Air is going to take our VIP guest experience to new heights and offer a convenient, seamless getaway that is unmatched in the market,” Hard Rock Atlantic City President Joe Lupo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cities served initially by the charter service are Farmingdale, NY; White Plains, NY; Scranton, PA; Latrobe, PA; Norfolk, VA; Richmond, VA; Baltimore; and Cincinnati.</p>
<p>The service includes complimentary airport parking as well as in-flight beverage and snack service. Patrons also will receive overnight accommodations at the casino and round-trip transportation to Atlantic City International Airport.</p>
<p>Joining the Fray</p>
<p>Hard Rock isn’t the first casino to offer chartered flights for its big money bettors, or whales, as they’re commonly known.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment, for example, offers chartered flights to Atlantic City, as well as Laughlin, NV; Reno; Lake Tahoe; Biloxi, MS; and Tunica, MS through its Caesars Rewards Air program.</p>
<p>Other companies, like Sun Country Airlines, offer their commercial airline fleet for chartered flights to casinos as well.</p>
<p>Hard Rock a Top Atlantic City Casino</p>
<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City opened three years ago after Hard Rock International purchased the old Trump Taj Mahal casino from investor and businessman Carl Icahn for $50 million in 2017.</p>
<p>The gaming company, owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida, then invested more than $500 million into the resort to overhaul it.</p>
<p>Then last month, Hard Rock officials announced they’re spending another $20 million to upgrade more than 90 suites at the hotel. Hard Rock added new flat-screen televisions and LED lighting in the Celebrity and Roxy Suites.</p>
<p>The investment also added a Starbucks Coffee to the boardwalk side of the casino, and the casino updated the beach bar to add more than 1,000 beach chairs.</p>
<p>The reason why Hard Rock is making these moves is that it’s become one of the top casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>According to figures from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, Hard Rock reported a casino win of $35.2 million in April, second only to the Borgata’s $38.5 million. For the year-to-date, the casino has taken in $116.2 million, again second to only the Borgata’s $160.3 million.</p>
<p>Hard Rock, according to state data, has 2,186 slot machines and 149 table games.</p>
