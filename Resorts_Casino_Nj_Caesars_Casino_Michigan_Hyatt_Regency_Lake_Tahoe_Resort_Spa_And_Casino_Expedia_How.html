<p>Baking Bonanza review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>Baking Bonanza is all about putting together delicious desserts, presenting you with an array of tasty treats to cook up as you play.</p>
<p>The game uses a bingo-style system to allow you to choose your own recipes (win conditions) and to collect the necessary ingredients (symbols).</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the Great British Bakeoff or you just enjoy a little bit of homemade confectionary, this might scratch your itchy sweet-tooth.</p>
<p>You can continue spinning even after you achieve a winning combination</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The slot is beautifully designed with a central appearance that owes much to the decor of English high-street tea rooms. The pastel coloured background and bright cakes, rendered in a clean dessert menu style, make for a charming atmosphere.</p>
<p>The tone of the slot is controlled by an excellent soundscape that starts with a jolly theme tune and ambient cooking noises, and works its way down to the detailed sounds which make up the win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>The animations are fairly simple, but they enhance the detailed and varied artwork, and work nicely with the sounds. Overall, this slot has a wonderfully designed front-end.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Baking Bonanza uses the Slingo system. This is a cross between slots and bingo. Players select a series of "recipes," each of which is made up of a series of "ingredients." Each recipe has a different payout, which is based on how difficult the combination of ingredients is to get.</p>
<p>The ingredients make up the symbols on the reels. A player collects ingredients when they appear on the five slots of the single reels.</p>
<p>Collecting all the ingredients for a recipe leads to a payout. The player receives five spins for their first wager. After that, they can either reset the reels, or continue, paying an additional amount for each subsequent spin.</p>
<p>The wager amount is adjusted by the software to ensure a uniform RTP.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Because of the unusual game format, Baking Bonanza doesn’t have a Bonus system nor does it make use of Wilds.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.47%, comfortably over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€1.00 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. The player can increase volatility somewhat by choosing higher paying recipes, which can make the game somewhat more suitable for our slot strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Baking Bonanza is a very pretty slot. It is stylish and executes its theme perfectly. Animations, art, and music are all on point.</p>
<p>The unusual gameplay won’t appeal to everyone, but if you’re looking for a little variety in your slot experience, it can’t hurt to roll in some Slingo-based offerings.</p>
<p>The RTP is solid, though we’d prefer a higher volatility game for strategic reasons, but if you’re not too worried about that, this is a good slot in most other ways.</p>
