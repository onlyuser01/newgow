    <h1>Mgm Hotel Casino Harrah S Casino San Diego Plainridge Park Casino Stagecoach Hotel And Casino Bellag</h1>

<p>Dear Administration of kasinoguru!</p>
<p>I`m a citizen of Ukraine.</p>
<p>To withdraw money Winbet demands from me the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government (front and back). This is completely against the terms and conditions of Winbet Company and the laws of Bulgaria and Ukraine. Below you will find all necessary information and arguments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I registered on Winbet site in August 2018. My screen name is sarkor and my username is korskor. From that time I successfully passed the verification process on Winbet several times. And during these processes Winbet never asked me Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government (front and back). Also since August 2018 I ordered many times different withdrawals and all of them have been paid out successfully from Winbet side (some examples are attached). The last withdrawal was processed by Winbet on 19.12.2021 (check the screen 2). And Winbet processed this withdrawal request without asking me for any Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government (front and back).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I registered on Winbet I accepted all the terms and conditions of Winbet. And in these terms and conditions there are no any mentions and tags that the players of different nationalities except Bulgarian have to have the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government. Check the screen 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If for registration and placing bets the client has to have the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government Winbet has to notify the client of such changes in the terms and conditions. Check the screen 4. But there is no such punkt of obliged to have the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government in the terms and conditions of Winbet at all. And there are no any changes in these terms also. And there is no notification about it from Winbet to me. Also it means that I couldn't place bets and play roulette on Winbet without accepting and agreeing that all the clients of different nationalities except Bulgarian have to have the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government. However, I placed bets, gambled on live roulette on Winbet, and successfully withdraw winnings without such Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government. It means that the clients of different nationalities except Bulgarian are not required to have the Document for permanent/temporary residence - issued by the Bulgarian government for placing bets and gambling on Winbet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clients of Winbet comply with the regulations of the state of which they are a citizen and of the state on the territory of which is the IP address from which the registration for participation in online betting was made. Check the screen 5. As I mentioned, my citizenship is Ukrainian. In Ukraine the gambling law was officially approved. You can check it from the official Ukrainian resource - https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/768-20 . So as a person registered on Winbet I have all legal rights to gamble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The situation when Winbet doesn<code>t want to pay out my legal winnings is continuous since the December of 2021 (check the screen 6). My last appeal to Winbet was on May 13, 2022 via live chat. And from this time I didn</code>t receive any official reply from Winbet via email. Also Winbet blocked my account and doesn`t want to contact with me at all. The last official notification from them was on the 10th of May 2022 that they have accepted my request and from this time there is no more any notifications from Winbet.</p>

<p>Dear administration of kasinoguru! Kindly help me to resolve the problems with receiving my legal winnings from Winbet (615 euro at this moment). This situation is continuous since the December of 2021! Winbet has to unblock my account and to pay out all my winnings according to the terms and conditions of Winbet and the laws of Bulgaria and Ukraine.</p>
