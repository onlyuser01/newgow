<p>Gaming and betting technology supplier Betby announced a change within its executive team as former Chief Sportsbook Officer, Sergey Tsukanov, assumed the role of Chief Product Officer.</p>
<p>New Challenges Ahead</p>
<p>The appointment of Tsukanov as Chief Product Officer for Betby will see the company’s former sportsbook executive extend his position and influence within the business, assuming the responsibility to provide oversight for Betby’s Risk Management and Trading functions.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new role within the business, Tsukanov expressed how excited he felt at the opportunity “to take new challenges and drive even greater success” for the company he had been working for in the past few years.</p>
<p>“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve in an expanded capacity and look forward to working with everyone to build on our past successes and drive future growth,” he said.</p>
<p>As Chief Product Officer, Tsukanov will be based at one of the company’s offices – in Riga, Latvia – and will be expected to leverage his industry experience and help the business to pursue its strategy and achieve its objectives.</p>
<p>Tsukanov joined Malta-headquartered Betby in July 2008 as Head of Sportsbook and spent more than four years perfecting the role before being promoted to Chief Sportsbook Officer now.</p>
<p>Trial and Error in His Early Career</p>
<p>Tsukanov, who holds an Engineer Diploma in Applied Mathematics from the Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Informatics, now part of the Moscow University of Technology, began his career in February 2010, when he assumed the role of Live Trader with betting operator Liga Stavok.</p>
<p>Based in the Russian capital, Moscow, Tsukanov stayed in the role until October 2016, gaining more than six years of betting industry experience with the leading Russian bookmaker.</p>
<p>After ten months on the sidelines, his career resumed in August 2017 with the sports betting affiliate FortunaLive, where he assumed the role of Head of Trading but stayed with the company for just four months.</p>
<p>After the short stay with Ukrainian-based FortunaLive, Tsukanov remained unemployed for eight months and in search of his next career move, until he finally joined Betby in 2018 where his career began to flourish.</p>
<p>In January, Betby opened a new office in Montenegro to expand its geographical footprint and operational capabilities. Located in Budva, the modern facility marked the tech supplier’s second European office, besides its headquarters in Sliema, Malta, and has the capacity to expand further and meet future scaling personnel needs of the business.</p>
<p>The development also marked an encouraging start to the new year for the company which managed to double its headcount to more than 80 people in 2022.</p>
