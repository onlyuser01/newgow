    <h1>The Mirage Hotel Casino Best Casino Bonus Maryland Live Casino In Arundel Mills Casinos Bossier City</h1>

<p>Online sports betting and casino gaming brand MaximBet announced that its sportsbook has gone live in its second US jurisdiction, Indiana, in partnership with Kambi Group and White Hat Gaming.</p>
<p>Unwavering Commitment to Fans</p>
<p>The launch in Indiana is expected to be the first in a series of rapid launches for the emerging gaming brand in several additional markets including Iowa, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Daniel Graetzer, founder and chief executive officer of MaximBet, outlined the “unwavering commitment” of the brand to present its fans with “the greatest sports betting experience in the world” paired with “premium content” and within a “world-class betting environment,” adamant that the brand will quickly bring its “unique value proposition to players throughout the country.”</p>
<p>“To begin now just as the NFL season is revving up and with NHL, NBA and college basketball action right around the corner, we couldn’t be more excited about our future,” Graetzer concluded.</p>
<p>The launch in Indiana is the first to feature the expansive sports betting service and user experience technology, a product of MaximBet’s exclusive partnerships with Kambi Group and White Hat Gaming.</p>
<p>Leveraging Sports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>From Kambi, MaximBet’s sportsbook will leverage betting solutions, compliance, risk management, and sports integrity expertise, attracting bettors with features such as microbetting, BetBuilder, thousands of markets, and the tech supplier’s parlay product, Teaser+.</p>
<p>Thrilled to go live with MaximBet in Indiana, Kambi chief executive officer and co-founder Kristian Nylén pointed to the brand’s ambition “to become a leading sports betting brand and deliver an engaging experience” to its players, emphasizing that MaximBet’s “customer-first mentality” makes the launch in The Hawkeye State “an exciting opportunity for both parties as well as bettors.”</p>
<p>iGaming Platform and PAM Technology</p>
<p>From White Hat Gaming, MaximBet gains access to its iGaming platform and PAM solution and will benefit from its proprietary technology such as first-to-market traveling wallet and in-house cashier.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, White Hat Gaming chief executive officer Phil Gelvan underlined that the company’s “ability to help manage the PAM technology will enable MaximBet to continue focusing on their aggressive growth plans over the next year,” adamant that what united both partners from the beginning was their “shared vision of delivering a best-in-class gaming experience.”</p>
<p>To connect with players in Indiana, MaximBet is offering a first-time deposit match up to a $250 bonus and “Super Freaky Odds Boosts” daily and will soon announce opportunities to earn tickets to Maxim parties, brand merchandise and other exclusive events.</p>
