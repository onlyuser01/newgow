<p>The Wildos review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Wildos has a Wild West theme.</p>
<p>The game follows a group of three bandits that have found themselves locked up in a dusty old Western town. Your job is to bust them out by landing explosive Scatters on the reels and trigger a Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>Fans of Western slots like Wild Chapo, Dead or Alive 2, and Money Train 3 will find plenty to enjoy here.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Step into the Wild West when you take The Wildos slot from Thunderkick for a spin. The Wild West tends to be depicted in one of two ways in slot games. You either get the more intense and violent West, as seen in slots like Tombstone RIP and Wanted: Dead or a Wild, or a more cartoonish approach like Wild Chapo 2. The Wildos slot falls into the latter category. The titular characters are three mischievous bandits that have been locked up in jail on the side of the reels.</p>
<p>Each of them makes an appearance in the game, with the symbols being animated to help add some extra charm. The soundtrack is a slow Spaghetti-Western-style tune, the type that you would expect to be played in the final showdown as both cowboys run their fingers over the butt of their revolvers.</p>
<p>It’s a fun design from Thunderkick, and it’s one that looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>
<p>Big win in The Wildos slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay for The Wildos keeps things simple. The slot uses a 5x3 set-up with 15 fixed paylines active on every spin.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are formed by matching three or more symbols across a payline, starting on the left-most reel. Players can check the payline using the slot’s paytable at any time.</p>
<p>The controls for the game are found on the side and beneath the reels. The spin button is in the bottom corner, with the option to change the stake and play autospin to the left of it.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wildos has a Multiplier Wild symbol that can land on the central three reels. Not only does it substitute for other symbols to help make winning combos, but it will also have a Multiplier value of up to x5 attached. This Multiplier is applied to any wins it is a part of. If more than one Multiplier lands, they are multiplied together.</p>
<p>The main feature is the Bonus Game. This is launched when players land three or more Scatter symbols. This rewards eight free spins. Any time a Wild lands, it sticks to the reels during the spins. The Wild door will swing home on every winning spin and reveal a random Multiplier. All Wilds are collected beneath the middle three reels, and if players fill up one of the meters, three additional spins are added.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The maximum win available in The Wildos is 6,250x the player’s stake. The slot has an RTP of 96.15%, putting it slightly above the industry average.</p>
<p>It is considered highly volatile by Thunderkick, which is something we always like to see and we recommend in our slot strategy.</p>
<p>Paytable for the highest paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Clicking the stake option beneath the reels will raise a selection of stakes. The minimum bet is $0.10, and the maximum is $100.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Wildos sees Thunderkick make great use of a popular theme and bonus features. The combination of Sticky Wilds and Free Spins is always fun, and the game’s design helps to elevate this. The bonus round can get really fun once you start filling the reels with Wilds, with the Multipliers quickly adding up.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a fun, highly volatile slot we recommend for a spin.</p>
