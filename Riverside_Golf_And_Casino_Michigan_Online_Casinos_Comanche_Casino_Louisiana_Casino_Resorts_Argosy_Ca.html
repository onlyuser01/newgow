    <h1>Riverside Golf And Casino Michigan Online Casinos Comanche Casino Louisiana Casino Resorts Argosy Ca</h1>

<p>This casino either has no understanding of how Interac e-transfers work, or they are purposely making the verification process impossible.</p>
<p>I spent an hour with chat ( I have the transcript) trying to explain that when a withdrawal is made via Interac etransfer it simply goes to the account the prior deposit was made. I submitted screenshots of my online banking, the actual deposit shown on my account, and the reciept with the exact time, day, and tracking number of my last deposit. The agent insisted that I need a 20 digit ID banking number that needed to be submitted, even though there is obviously no place to put one when making a withdrawal and any Canadian who uses Interac knows that's not a thing and doesn't exist. To make matters worse the KYC department followed up now asking for a picture of my bank card, front and back with expiry ect as if it was a credit card. I didn't use my credit card, I used online banking via Interac etransfer. They either have no idea what they are doing, or this is a scam.</p>
<p>I'll be happy to send the rest of my photo ID and documents when it's clear these folks know what an etransfer via Interac actually is and how it works. This was unsettling and upsetting. I'm sending the chat session as an attachment and am copying and the latest KYC email I've received. I am actually afraid to send anymore documents to this casino because I'm concerned they don't know what they are doing or worse.</p>
<p>I am unable to upload any attachments for some reason. Please advise how I can send you the relevant information. Thank you for your time.</p>
