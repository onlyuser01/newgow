<p>Drake, the globally-recognized rapper and famous high-stakes bettor, did not surprise anyone after placing a hefty wager on the Jake Paul versus Nate Diaz boxing fight that took place this weekend. Last week, a fan page on Twitter of the famous rapper released what is believed to be his betting slip from Stake.com, revealing that he placed a $250,000 bet on Diaz.</p>
<p>As the underdog, the odds for Diaz were +340 compared to the -440 odds for Paul, the YouTube influencer turned boxer. The screenshot of the betting slip included a short message stating: “Jake is a dog but I can never bet against a Diaz brother. That’s just how I was raised.”</p>
<p>During the face-off before the fight, an actual brawl broke out. As with most fighters, there were lots of hand gestures and calls. Shouts from the audience were heard as well but at some point, security guards started to push each other, resulting in a brawl in the middle of the stage. This included some fists flying before the brawl was stopped and each of the fighters was escorted by their security off the stage.</p>
<p>Considering the hefty $250,000 bet, Drake’s estimated payout was $1 million and that would’ve happened unless Paul won the fight, which he did. Fighting against Diaz, the YouTuber-turned-boxer won by a unanimous decision on Saturday night. Points in his favor were as follows: 97-92, 98-91, 98-91.</p>
<p>The Famous Rapper Continues to Bet Big</p>
<p>While Drake had a good plan, this time, he didn’t have the correct guess. Still, the famous rapper and music icon is known to have placed even bigger bets in the past. Back in June, Drake banked $800,000 after placing a wager on the Denver Nuggets to beat the Miami Heat in the NBA Championship.</p>
<p>On the other hand, last year, Drake placed another hefty bet on a fight with the participation of Paul last year. At the time, the famous high-stakes bettor put some $430,000 on a fight between Paul and Tommy Fury, Tyson Fury’s cousin. Similarly to the most recent wager, he lost that bet too.</p>
