    <h1>Boulder Station Casino Mystic Lake Hotel And Casino Playlive Casino Pa Casinos Off The Strip In Vega</h1>

<p>Good day, I made a deposit in this casino for the first time on 09/03. As the casino is new and I don't trust new casinos, I deposited only €4 via bank transfer. The money never made it to my play account.</p>
<p>First, they strung me along telling me to wait 24 hours as it can take up to 24 hours, then after I reached out 24 hours later, they told me to wait 5 days. I have never heard of a casino before where it takes up to 5 days for the deposit to be credited to the play account.</p>
<p>I have money to be gambled and when I make a deposit, I know why and what for, thankfully it's not a lot of money as I made only a minimal deposit suspecting that this casino might be crap. But I surely won't gift this casino €4! Even though it's a small amount, I insist on getting it back because it's the principle that counts! We are all not playing with play money and deposit real money, and this casino just keeps funds, which I see as scam and that's my only issue. I want my money back, I don't care if it's only €4, I won't give these fraudsters any money.</p>
