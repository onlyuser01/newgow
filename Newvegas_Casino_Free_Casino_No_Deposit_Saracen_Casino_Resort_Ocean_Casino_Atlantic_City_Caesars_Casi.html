<p>What makes Aristocrat Gaming’s NFL-themed slots special is the fact that players can choose their favorite NFL team to play with</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming continues the rollout of its NFL-themed slot games. Yesterday, the leading slot machine and casino game manufacturer released its new NFL Super Bowl Link.</p>
<p>The new title is a class 3 game on Aristocrat Gaming’s popular MarsX Portrait cabinet and comes just in time for the real-life Super Bowl. Described as a high-volatility game with average feature frequency, the NFL Super Bowl Link will engage fans with some NFL action ahead of the big game.</p>
<p>What makes Aristocrat Gaming’s NFL-themed slots special is the fact that players can choose their favorite NFL team to play with, adding an important level of personalization. Reflecting the company’s commitment to providing fans with high-quality sports-themed products, the new NFL Super Bowl Link allows players to pick any of the 32 teams in the National Football League.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game boasts an SSP jackpot starting at $10,000, as well as an SAP jackpot starting at $1,000 and $5,000.</p>
<p>NFL Super Bowl Link’s gameplay is further diversified by a variety of engaging features, such as the Wild Card Bonus. For reference, this mechanic allows players to win five free games with cash-on-reel, wild stacks and a chance to trigger the game’s Hold &amp; Spin feature.</p>
<p>For reference, the Super Bowl Hold &amp; Spin awards cash-on-reels football prizes of 5x to 100x the bet, or the Mini, Minor or Major jackpots. In the meantime, the Super Bowl Ultimate Hold &amp; Spin feature awards cash-on-reels football prizes of 50x to 100x the bet, or the Minor or Major jackpots.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Is Suing a Developer Who Might Have Stolen Important Files</p>
<p>The launch of the new NFL Super Bowl Link comes just as Aristocrat filed legal claims against one of its game design directors. Dinh Toan Tran, who designs games for the company, just found himself in hot water as Aristocrat understood that he had allegedly downloaded thousands of confidential files.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Dinh Toan Tran might have downloaded as many as 6,800 files, which Aristocrat is now seeking to recover.</p>
