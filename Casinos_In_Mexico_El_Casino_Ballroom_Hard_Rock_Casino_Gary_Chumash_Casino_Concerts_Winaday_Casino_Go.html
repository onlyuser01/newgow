<p>Gordon Moody, a foremost charity dedicated to tackling problem gambling in the United Kingdom, will feature in a BBC production broadcast on TV, radio and online on Thursday, April 6. The production focuses on Gordon Moody’s efforts to help treat women patients who experience and suffer from gambling-related harm at a time when the stakes for the industry are increasing, and lawmakers, treatment specialists, and consumers are garnering unique insight into the issue and how to move past it.</p>
<p>Today’s broadcast is based on BBC’s visit to Gordon Moody’s women’sresidential treatment center. The center was opened in 2021 and was designed specifically for the needs of women. The innovative facility has been going strong for two years now, bringing the right treatment to the people who need it. The facility offers a safe environment in which women who have been severely affected by gambling can make a meaningful impact in their recovery journey.</p>
<p>This facility was launched at a time when the number of women-sufferers with gambling addiction is at an all-time high in the United Kingdom. Gordon Moody focuses on connecting patients with people who have recovered and shared their lived experiences. The charity argues that women gamblers need a different approach to treatment as they tend to be able to function in society while struggling with their addiction.</p>
<p>Short-term interventions may not be sufficient, cautions Gordon Moody. The upcoming BBC broadcasts today focus on familiarizing audiences with the ex-service users who have completed the program in the past year.</p>
<p>"Raising awareness of our services is vital to ensure that we can help people access the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place," Gordon Moody said commenting on the BBC filming. Casino Guru and Gordon Moody have signed a partnership in December to work on a free Safer Gambling Course.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates about the BBC’s broadcasts and Gordon Moody’s work in the industry.</p>
