    <h1>Boulder Station Casino Lake Tahoe Casino Casinos In Jackson Mississippi Texas Online Casino Delano C</h1>

<p>The new channel, launched by ARC and its recently-acquired subsidiary, is called ARC Media International (AMI) and is centered on broadcasts of live racing content.</p>
<p>AMI and Vermantia Leverage CAP to Launch a New Channel</p>
<p>The content on AMI will include flat and national hunt races broadcast live from ARC’s sixteen racecourses, as well as from a selection of independent tracks. The channel’s live content is expected to feature as many as 700 annual fixtures from famous tracks, including Ascot, Doncaster and Lingfield Park.</p>
<p>Vermantia’s Complex Automated Production (CAP) service, a unique proprietary solution that automates complex actions in a remote way, will be employed in the operations of the AMI channel. As reported by Vermantia, its in-house system blends rich racing and betting information that is communicated to customers through appealing graphics. Fans are further engaged by live racing commentators and analysts that provide tips to the passionate viewers and bettors.</p>
<p>ARC and Vermantia wasted no time rolling out the channel in many major sports betting markets. The service is already live across many notable operators in Europe, the United States and South Africa. Thanks to the aforementioned CAP service, the channel can be quickly implemented into any retail sportsbook in the world.</p>
<p>AMI Is a Great Tote Betting Service</p>
<p>Menelaos Ladopoulos, the chief technology officer of Vermantia, commented on the agreement. He noted that his team is committed to producing best-in-class technology and is glad to provide operators with a comprehensive racing service for Tote betting.</p>
<p>We are always in line with the growing demand from the market for premium quality and fast-paced racing, which is powered with a fully automated service and zero-hassle for the operator, making it the most complete offering of its kind worldwide. Menelaos Ladopoulos, CTO, Vermantia</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mark Kingston, Arena Racing Company’s director of media and technology, said that the AMI channel seeks to be a premium betting channel at an international level. He noted that the new service is a well-rounded blend of quality racing content, reliable betting data, fresh design and cutting-edge automation tech.</p>
<p>Its success has been seen from the beginning, being already adopted by multiple influential operators in the US, Europe, and South Africa. Mark Kingston, director of media and tech, ARC</p>
<p>True to Kingston’s words, the channel is already available with certain operators, which have so far been content by the service. One of these satisfied customers is Woodbine Entertainment, which praised the channel for its flawlessness.</p>
