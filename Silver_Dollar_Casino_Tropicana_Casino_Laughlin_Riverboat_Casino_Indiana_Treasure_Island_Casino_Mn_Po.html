    <h1>Silver Dollar Casino Tropicana Casino Laughlin Riverboat Casino Indiana Treasure Island Casino Mn Po</h1>

<p>Dear lominha172,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>I have checked the casino’s Terms and Conditions and this is what I found:</p>
<p>9.2 Betsamigo holds the right to not process a payment if the Account Holder’s identity, age and place of residence and proof of funds have not been sufficiently verified.</p>
<p>56.10.1 (...) Verification process will require from players to provide documents such as, but not limited to, identity cards, bank cards, bank statements, source of wealth, source of funds, and utility bills. In case of false personal data provided by the players, the withdrawal can be refused and the user account can be terminated. The player will be informed thereof by email. In some cases the Company can request Selfie with ID, Selfie with ID and special sign, or even call or video call. When any documents are requested, the Account Holder must upload such documentation on their Betsamigo Account (My Profile &gt; Documents). When requesting documents for an account verification, any pending withdrawals will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Could you please advise which documents you have already provided and when exactly did you send the last one? Have you provided all the required documents as soon as possible and in the correct format?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
