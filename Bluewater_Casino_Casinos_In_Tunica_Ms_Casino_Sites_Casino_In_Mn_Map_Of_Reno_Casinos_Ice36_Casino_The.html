    <h1>Bluewater Casino Casinos In Tunica Ms Casino Sites Casino In Mn Map Of Reno Casinos Ice36 Casino The</h1>

<p>Good afternoon Mr Adam</p>
<p>They sent me an email explaining how to verify the bonuses in my account, but as I told the Gentlemen I did not use the bonus as I read the terms before joining or depositing at the Casino, I have screenshots of the deposits I made, which gentlemen could verify that they are only the values that I deposited assets without any type of bonus, once again I repeat, I did not use bonuses my winnings were legal and legitimate, so much so that on the same day the support of the ICE36 casino sent me an email congratulating me and asking me to send a photo of myself for them to use in promotional campaigns, I just want what is rightfully mine my real earnings in real money and verified account, I have screenshots of everything I need to prove it, just ask that they help me to receive my money, because I am going through a very difficult situation in my personal life, I am unemployed and I have children, my ticket in Casinos is not for adventures or robes, and for financial necessity ira, I always control my losses and I am aware of the risks, but in my current situation I have no options.</p>
<p>For this reason I want and demand that my winnings were legal and legitimate, the biggest proof of which was the email that the Casino sent me on the day of the winnings.</p>
<p>I had made a deposit on the same day and lost the total, but I didn't complain, because I knew the risks.</p>
<p>Whatever you need proof of, Sir Adam, I'll be at your disposal.</p>
<p>I ask that if we cannot resolve my case here, please guide me, as I will take legal action that fits me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for the attention and affection that Casino Guru is giving me and helping me.</p>
<p>In particular Mr. Adam for his attention and dedication to my case.</p>
<p>I'm available for whatever needs proof, I just want what's mine by legal right, nothing more.</p>
