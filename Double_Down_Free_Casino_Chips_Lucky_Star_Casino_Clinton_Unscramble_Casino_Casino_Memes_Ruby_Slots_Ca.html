<p>The company's generous donation is set to play a pivotal role in establishing the Resources for Indigenous STEM Education (RISE) Fund</p>
<p>Leading gaming provider Aristocrat Gaming has taken a decisive stride towards bolstering the future workforce of the gaming industry through a substantial contribution of $500,000 to the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES).</p>
<p>AISES and Aristocrat Collaborate to Bridge Indigenous Communities with STEM in Gaming</p>
<p>Designed to amplify opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers for Indigenous students and professionals, the initiative seeks to equip participants with the tools and programs essential for their integration into the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Expressing her gratitude for Aristocrat’s commitment, Sarah EchoHawk, AISES president, noted, “We are honored by the relationship with Aristocrat Gaming and our mutual commitment to propel more Indigenous people to STEM education and careers. The company’s efforts are extraordinary—by sharing our collective story and engaging the gaming industry, we hope to enact real change in Indigenous STEM representation.”</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s significant involvement goes beyond financial support. The infusion of funds will also nurture scholarships, internships, and various avenues for professional growth, fostering a more inclusive and diverse landscape within the industry. This initiative takes on heightened significance considering the growing prevalence of digital payment solutions like PayPal and Skrill in the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Bolsters AISES Conference with Additional $30,000</p>
<p>At present, AISES champions the academic pursuits of 20 students enrolled in Casino Gaming programs across the United States through its scholarship initiative. Aristocrat’s considerable contribution will further fortify this support network. In addition to the initial donation, Aristocrat Gaming intends to contribute an extra $30,000 to facilitate the annual AISES conference events.</p>
<p>James Starr, president of VGT, an Aristocrat Gaming subsidiary, shared: “As a valued partner of ours for over six years, we are elated to further our relationship with AISES to intentionally invest in the gaming industry’s future workforce, helping to open up access to STEM education and career opportunities for Indigenous peoples.”</p>
<p>This announcement closely follows a recent report spotlighting a record-breaking $40.9 billion in tribal gaming revenue for FY2022. This underscores the escalating importance of cultivating a diversified and inclusive sector, not only for its economic implications but also for the potential to uplift communities. The collaboration between AISES and Aristocrat Gaming stands as a momentous stride toward realizing this aspiration.</p>
<p>Other recent developments saw NeoGames shareholders overwhelmingly vote in favor of Aristocrat Leisure Limited’s proposed acquisition of NeoGames S.A., announced in May, with more than 99% supporting the deal. The $1.2 billion acquisition will involve NeoGames transferring its statutory seat from Luxembourg to the Cayman Islands and merging with a subsidiary of Aristocrat.</p>
