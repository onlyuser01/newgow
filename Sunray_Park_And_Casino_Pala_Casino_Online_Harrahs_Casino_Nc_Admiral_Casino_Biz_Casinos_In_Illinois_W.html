<p>Française des Jeux, France’s national lottery operator, has released a new payment solution in collaboration with the French Confederation of Tobacconists. The so-called Nirio solution will help French families pay their bills at designated outlets.</p>
<p>Nirio Is Fast, Confidential and Efficient</p>
<p>Nirio allows people in France to pay for their monthly needs, including water, electricity, gas, rent and such at all of the authorized payment hubs. According to the lottery operator, players will be able to use the Nirio app to scan their bills or fines. The application will subsequently generate a QR code that players can later use to pay. After presenting the QR code at one of the authorized payment outlets, customers can pay their bills in cash or by using a bank card. They will receive a receipt that confirms their payment.</p>
<p>The new solution effectively eliminates the hassle of carrying a batch of invoices around and allows French citizens to keep all of their bills’ information in one place. In addition, FDJ has pointed out that over six million households in France are reluctant to use direct debit to pay their bills. The new quality of life solution will offer such people a viable and intuitive alternative.</p>
<p>FDJ Wants to Provide People with an Intuitive Payment Solution</p>
<p>Raphaël Botbol, the director of strategy, innovation and new activities at Française des Jeux, believes that bill payments should be people-centric. According to him, Nirio is a great, practical and quick way for certain people to pay their bills. The solution, the director said, targets primarily people who live far away from urbanized areas or do not wish to pay digitally.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 FDJ partners have applied to accept Nirio as a payment solution. The French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority has so far approved over half of these applications. One of the most notable Nirio partners yet is Seqens, a social housing company. As a result, Seqens customers can already use Nirio to pay their rent at the designated payment centers.</p>
<p>FDJ is one of the leaders when it comes to gambling in France. The company, which dominates the lottery space, recently announced its intentions to expand into other verticals as well. The French juggernaut plans to acquire the horse racing specialist ZEturf. The negotiations with the latter company, however, are still in their early stage.</p>
<p>As a lottery and gaming company, FDJ acknowledges the need to be socially responsible as well. As a result, the company recently launched the fifth edition of its Mission Patrimoine, an initiative that raises money for the restoration of important historical buildings. On the same note, FDJ teamed up with Foundation du Patrimoine to donate money for the restoration of YMCA Paris.</p>
