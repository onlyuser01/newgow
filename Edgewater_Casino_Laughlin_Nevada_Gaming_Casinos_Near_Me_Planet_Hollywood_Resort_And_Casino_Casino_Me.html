<p>The World Poker Tour announced that they have signed a syndication deal across different TV channels in all the states to help them spread their product to even more viewers, starting from WPT Series XII.</p>
<p>TV poker is the entertainment for the public</p>
<p>Poker is so popular nowadays that millions around the world understand it is not only a contest where each player measures personal skills against the others, but also that it is a hugely entertaining event with high stakes and massive doses of adrenaline pumping in the heads, and this popularity has been achieved mainly through the TV.</p>
<p>The agreement signed on January 14 includes 22 markets across all regions and will allow WPT product to reach to 15 million more homes in the US that can view WPT programming, with the total number of households in the country being able to watch WPT events reaching 102 million.</p>
<p>“The World Poker Tour continues to expand its reach, and we are thrilled to be syndicating some of the most popular seasons of the WPT in markets across the U.S.”, Loc Sondheim, Director of Ad Sales and Distribution for WPT.</p>
<p>Despite that WPT is now in Series XVIII, airing of poker contents along the syndication deal started on January 6 with the Series XII Bicycle Casino’s Legends of Poker, giving viewers a real chance to get acquainted with past events and players and re-experience the thrill.</p>
<p>TV is just one of the means to make poker popular</p>
<p>Televising poker content is not the sole initiative WPT has undertaken to popularize their events throughout the states and make them even more enticing to the public, as they have licensing agreements with Zynga Poker for the game in the social network and a stake in an online poker operator, ClubWPT, who became popular with the recent announcement that they will add $1 million to the prize of any WPT Main Tour event qualifier who wins the event, with all this on top of their history of partnership with 888 and partypoker on several live tournaments in the past.</p>
<p>As the popularity of online poker in the US continues to grow with the number of states pushing for its legalization getting higher and higher, it emphasizes significant opportunities to expand on poker programming contents and and make it even more popular among the public, positioning every televised event as the utmost exciting experience for the viewers and thus further improving on the overall image of the game.</p>
