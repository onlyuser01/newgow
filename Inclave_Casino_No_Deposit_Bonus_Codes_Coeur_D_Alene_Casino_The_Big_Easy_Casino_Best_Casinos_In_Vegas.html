    <h1>Inclave Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Coeur D Alene Casino The Big Easy Casino Best Casinos In Vegas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had my Chipstars account suspended for 6 months and then banned due to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>However, it was possible for me to reopen my account before the 6 months had elapsed.</p>
<p>The following is stated on Chipstars' website:</p>
<p>Games &amp; More BV is dedicated to giving our players a safe and enjoyable gaming experience. If you opt for self-exclusion, your gaming account with Games &amp; More BV will be immediately self-excluded for the selected period. This implies that you won't be able to login, deposit or play with Games &amp; More BV while self-excluded. Please be aware that you will not be eligible to reactivate your account until your chosen self-exclusion period has ended.</p>
<p>According to their own terms and conditions, it should not be possible to reopen an account before the exclusion period has ended.</p>
<p>Having lost money again, I subsequently got myself banned due to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Just a few days later, I was able to reopen my account.</p>
<p>Both the customer chat support as well as my VIP Manager reopened my account despite there being a ban for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I can prove all of this. I have screenshots. I also have screenshots of myself telling my VIP Manager that I have a gambling addiction and want to reopen my account. My account was reactivated within minutes.</p>
<p>Chipstars is thus seriously contravening player safety if a player with a gambling addiction is unable to permanently suspend their account.</p>
<p>I even wrote to the chat and the VIP Manager, asking why they had reopened my account despite the ban for gambling addiction. Their response was that they had credited me with a â‚¬10 bonus. Just imagine that.</p>
<p>No casino has neglected player safety as extremely as Chipstars so far. I've documented everything and have proof of it, and so I'm demanding a refund for my deposits after my ban. The 6-month ban should never have been lifted.</p>
<p>Both the VIP Manager and the Chat Support openly admit that they reopened my account despite a gambling addiction ban and assert to me that this does not violate any policies.</p>
<p>This not only contravenes the policies of the licensing authorities, but it is also morally reprehensible to allow a person with a gambling addiction to continue to play, knowing full well that this person is a gambler and therefore cannot control themselves.</p>
