    <h1>Bellagio Casino New Casino In Chandler Presque Isle Downs Casino Stellaris Casino Aruba 007 Royal Ca</h1>

<p>24kcasino.com is acting shady and outright scamming with my rewards store purchase, 1 BTC, plus added difficulties and rude ignorance towards me to get my account balance of €20,000 paid out on top of that.</p>
<p>I played over 1000,000 loyalty points and redeemed with that their reward store prize: one physical bitcoin sent to my home address.</p>
<p>After making the claim for the prize, instead of congratulating/confirming the reward anyway which a follow-up email or such, they credited my account with only €50 and after that stayed silent even though I sent inquiries about how am I going to receive the reward.</p>
<p>After some days more they removed the 1 BTC for 1000,000 loyalty points reward from their reward store.</p>
<p>If I knew they cheat like this with the false claim of having such a reward option, I wouldn't have used my 1000,000 points for the useless €50, but instead of some other reward, or I wouldn't have played for so many points at all and lost thousands of euros to accumulate the points.</p>
<p>Even though this obviously seems 100% scam in which they used serious scale misleading as a weapon to hurt their customer like this - this isn't all!</p>
<p>After my several contact attempts, they finally replied, but only making up some new "rules" afterward (surprise, surprise), stories that my points would now suddenly be somehow only 5% worth because I played table games. (pathetic) But the funniest thing is that I didn't even play table games at all. I played video poker. (pathetic times one hundred)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it's clear to anyone in their right mind that they are making up stories to avoid sending the reward for which I did a lot of playing, put time, effort, and above all lost lots of money before reaching there.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I hit one royal flush in the last meters before reaching 1000,000 loyalty points. My balance went over €20,000 and now they are only willing to pay me €3,000 right away and won't promise that I could get anything else in any timely manner, more exactly they leave the timetable totally open and unknown to me. They refuse to tell me anything about when I could even possibly receive the rest of my balance. They asked me to request the payout in smaller installments. They avoid answering straight to my any straight question.</p>
<p>24kcasino made a major scale step to a huge scam at the expense of their loyal customer. This is a serious case. I would really need help, thank you.</p>
<p>If 24kcasino denies that I ever had 1000,000 points, or that they ever had such a 1 BTC for 1000,000 points reward, or that I ever successfully bought the aforementioned reward, I have everything recorded in photos and videos starting from the actual moment of purchase and even before. I also have screenshots of their reward terms and conditions, everything recorded at the moment of my playing, and at the moment of the reward claim. I can send all this later to Casino Guru during this case if needed.</p>
<p>One more important point, I have proof also that I claim without a problem other rewards with my points, which I also accumulated only by playing video poker. That is a proof on top of everything that indeed the points counted just as much full as any to claim rewards, not only some ridiculous 5% how they try to stage their scam of non-payment with this particular bigger reward.</p>
<p>It's obvious that they try to avoid paying. 24kcasino needs to understand that they can't do this. If they do, the consequences to their business are massive. In that case, they are out - totally out of business to the curb if this scam plays on like this from their side. Outrageous.</p>
