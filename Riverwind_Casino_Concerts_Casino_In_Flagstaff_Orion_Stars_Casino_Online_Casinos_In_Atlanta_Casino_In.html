<p>Juventus and Inter meet in the semifinal of the Italian Cup. The first game of the 2023 Coppa Italia doubleheader is on the program on Tuesday, April 4, at Allianz Stadium in Turin</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Juventus and Inter played in the Italian Serie A, and the boys from Turin won 1-0. It was a continuation of Inter’s poor form which started in late February. Juve, on the other hand, have been playing very well in all competitions. Are we going to see them record another win as bookies suggest with their Coppa Italia odds? Or maybe Inter will cause a sensation?</p>

<p>Juventus Wanna Keep Steamrolling Their Opponents</p>
<p>The guys in black-and-white have been brilliant in 2023 in all competitions they’re taking part in. They’ve reached the quarterfinal stage of the Europa League where they’ll take on Sporting CP. In the Italian Serie A, they’re seventh, but it’s because the federation took away 15 points from them. If it hadn’t happened, they’d be second in the standings.</p>
<p>They can’t win the Italian league, but they can win the Italian cup. In fact, they’re the No. 1 favorites to do so. This goes especially if they beat Inter Milan, considering that the other semifinal is Cremonese vs. Fiorentina.</p>
<p>So, can they beat Inter? They sure do have the manpower to do so. Most of their key men are fit and ready for Tuesday’s game, with only a couple of players struggling with fitness (e.g., Leonardo Bonucci and Paul Pogba).</p>
<p>Inter Hate Playing in Turin</p>
<p>Inter Milan have beaten Juventus on the road only once in their last 15 trips to Turin. The last time they played at Allianz Stadium, they lost 2-0. But it’s not just about away games – Inter generally have a bad history with Juventus.</p>
<p>The last time they played against this team, they lost 1-0 at home. It happened on March 19, with the only goal of the game being the work of Filip Kostic. What’s interesting is that Inter players were the ones to keep the ball in possession for more than two-thirds of the time. They also had more than two times more goal attempts than the opposition.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s clear that their biggest problem is their offense. That’s kind of surprising considering that they got Lautaro Martinez, Edin Dzeko, and Romelu Lukaku in the attacking department.</p>
<p>Juventus vs Inter Coppa Italia Prediction</p>
<p>We haven’t seen too many goals in the last couple of duels between Juventus and Inter Milan. However, we think that might change. The Coppa Italia duel on Tuesday is supposed to be a real thriller, with plenty of goals on both ends. We do, however, think Juve will score more than Inter.</p>
<p>Pick: Juventus to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
