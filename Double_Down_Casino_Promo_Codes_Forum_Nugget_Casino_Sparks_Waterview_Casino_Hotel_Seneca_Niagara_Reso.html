<p>Upon arriving on the scene, police officers from the San Jacinto County Sheriff’s Office saw 300 people that tried to flee by going into the nearby woods</p>
<p>Cock fighting is an activity that is illegal across the United States. Depending on the state, individuals caught organizing, participating or viewing such illegal cockfights are subject to different penalties that can include jail time, hefty fines or both. In one operation against illegal cock fighting in Texas, nearly 20 individuals were arrested and close to 100 live birds were seized.</p>
<p>The incident dates back to last month when the San Jacinto County Sheriff’s Office responded to an incident call about animal cruelty. Police were dispatched to 100 Maxine Road, Cleveland, San Jacinto County with two patrol Deputies and one patrol Sergeant arriving at the scene to find between 250 and 300 individuals watching and/or participating in a large-scale illegal cockfighting operation.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of law enforcement, all individuals dispersed, running into the surrounding woods. The suspects left approximately 100 vehicles on the scene. First responders were able to detain 19 individuals involved in the illegal cock fighting operation. Out of the 19 individuals arrested, 18 were charged with misdemeanors over viewing the illegal cock fights. On the other hand, one person was charged with felony over his participation in the cruel activity and one person was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance that was less than 1 gram.</p>
<p>According to the Sheriff’s Office, a total of 96 live birds were seized from different cages, vehicles and transport boxes on the crime scene. While dead birds were found as well, police also uncovered cock fighting paraphernalia, which included razor-sharp miniature knife objects that are attached to the feet of the birds. Those objects, called gaffs, aim at stabbing or slash-cutting opposing roosters during fights.</p>
<p>“Animal Cruelty will NOT be tolerated in San Jacinto County,“ reads a statement released by the San Jacinto County Sheriff’s Office</p>
<p>Police Seized Cash and Firearms</p>
<p>Additional cock fighting paraphernalia uncovered included steroids, cages, drugs and vitamins, along with cages and custom trailers fit for transporting live birds. Upon uncovering the illegal operation, law enforcement towed 75 vehicles from the scene. Some 43 vehicles were seized along with four custom trailers that were equipped to transport birds.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the police uncovered large sums of cash and firearms during the recent operation. Overall, $22,096 was sized from the 19 people arrested. One of the people involved had some $6,000 in cash. “The subjects with the larger amounts of cash were found to be the registered owners of vehicles that were seized which also contained cock fighting paraphernalia,” explained the Sheriff’s Office. During the raid, five fully loaded semi-automatic pistols were seized from the vehicles on site. Out of the 19 arrested individuals, seven were believed to be undocumented aliens.</p>
