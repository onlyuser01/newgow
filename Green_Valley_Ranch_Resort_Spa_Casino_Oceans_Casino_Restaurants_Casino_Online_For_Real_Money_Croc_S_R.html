<p>3 Oaks Gaming welcomed the new hire to the company, saying that Vashukevich is sure to make a difference and help the distributor grow</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming, a fast-growing distributor of online gambling content, has expanded its team with a new head of account management. The one joining the company is none other than the experienced Victoria Vashukevich who boasts years of experience in the sector.</p>
<p>Vashukevich will serve the company from its headquarters on the Isle of Man. She has previously worked in development roles at various other European companies and will bring this expertise to the 3 Oaks team.</p>
<p>Vashukevich’s Experience Will Benefit 3 Oaks</p>
<p>Vashukevich’s career started at Raiffeisen Bank Aval, where she served as project manager for almost four years. In October 2011, she joined the financial platform TRDATA as a customer relations director – a position she occupied for five years.</p>
<p>Between 2018 and 2019, Vashukevich had a short stint as a business development executive at Spotware Systems. She eventually joined Beetroot’s global business development team but left after a little more than a year.</p>
<p>In 2021, Vashukevich joined the progressive game studio Booongo Gaming as a global account manager. She was eventually promoted to head of account management – a position she still occupies to this day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the appointee’s new position at 3 Oaks Gaming will see her oversee account management for the iGaming distributor’s client base. 3 Oaks’ customer base has been growing quickly as more and more companies now seek the distributor’s services.</p>
<p>MD Damian Welcomed the New Hire</p>
<p>The addition of Vashukevich as head of account management attests to the company’s intention to reinforce its Isle of Man office with more experienced professionals. Sebastian Damian, the company’s managing director, said that the company is “entering really exciting times” which is why expanding the team is a priority.</p>
<p>To continue down this path, expanding our team with quality people and personnel is at the forefront of what we want to do. Hiring the right people at 3 Oaks is paramount for the business to succeed. Sebastian Damian, MD, 3 Oaks Gaming</p>
<p>Damian added that Vashukevich is an important addition to the team who is sure to make a huge difference. He concluded that he is looking forward to working with her.</p>
<p>Vashukevich also spoke about her new position, saying that she is thrilled to join the 3 Oaks Gaming team. The hire praised the company for its fast growth and said that she is looking forward to leading the account management team into a new era.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, 3 Oaks Gaming signed an agreement with PIN-UP Ukraine, agreeing to supply the operator with casino games.</p>
