<p>The leading sportsbook and casino platform provider for the online gambling sector, Digitain, announced a senior-level promotion, strengthening its leadership team. On Wednesday, the company confirmed it appointed Grigor Asoyan to the role of Group Deputy CEO of Technology.</p>
<p>Digitain said that the appointment is effective immediately and marks the next important step for Asoyan's journey. In fact, the promotion comes as no surprise, considering his 10 years of experience with the company.</p>
<p>Before being appointed to the role of Group Deputy CEO of Technology, Asoyan held the position of Chief Technology Officer. But throughout his extensive career in the company, he also held other senior-level roles within the technology vertical.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 5, 2023, Asoyan shared his excitement saying that he is delighted to assume the new role with Digitain. He added: "Digitain has been a great brand to be part of over the last ten years and has experienced growth in all areas of its operations across multiple global markets."</p>
<p>Asoyan acknowledged that he is looking forward to the challenges of the new role. Keeping in mind the continuous growth of the company, it is likely that he will play a strategic role in its future expansion.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Digitain's new Group Deputy CEO of Technology said: "We have been and will continue to focus on new experiences, innovations, and the latest digital technologies for all our partners and customers to ensure we continue empowering your success within the iGaming supply chain."</p>
<p>Vardges Vardanyan, Digitain's Founder, was also excited about the recent promotion, outlining that in the last 10 years, Asoyan has proven his leadership skills and dedication to the business. In conclusion, the company's Founder noted: "As we expand our global reach in new and existing markets, his contribution to technology and solutions will further consolidate our market position as a leading iGaming provider."</p>
<p>The news about the promotion came after recently, Digitain secured important recognition for the gambling industry. Back in February, the company was selected as the best Sports Betting Platform at the Annual charity-centered International Gaming Awards (IGA).</p>
<p>The event, organized and run by Clever Duck Media, a leading media company, took place early in February at the famous 5-Star Savoy Hotel, recognizing companies within the iGaming industry for their achievements and innovations.</p>
<p>As a popular event for the iGaming vertical, the IGA awards enjoy attendance from some of the most popular land-based and online gambling operators in the world.</p>
