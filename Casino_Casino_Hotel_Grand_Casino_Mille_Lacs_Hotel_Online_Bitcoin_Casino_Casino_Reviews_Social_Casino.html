<p>With a wealth of gambling industry experience, Farahi is expected to facilitate healthcare services integration into the industry</p>
<p>Kindbridge, the mental health care provider for distressed and disordered gamblers, announced the appointment of the former president of the Colorado Gaming Association, David Jacques Farahi, as executive chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Help Build State-Level Relationships</p>
<p>The appointment of Farahi is expected to further Kindbridge’s expansion in the US by bringing his knowledge of the gambling industry, governmental and regulatory relations, to help it build relationships at the state level and provide more comprehensive care services for gamblers.</p>
<p>Daniel Umfleet, founder and chief executive officer of Kindbridge, expressed his excitement to have Farahi on board, pointing to his credentials that made him a perfect fit for the role and full confidence that this appointment would be key to fulfilling the company’s mission.</p>
<p>“His expertise and leadership will be instrumental in advancing our mission to provide the highest quality behavioral health services to those in need,” Umfleet said.</p>
<p>From his previous roles as a chief operating officer of Monarch Casino &amp; Resort and executive chairman of slot analytics provider, Quick Custom Intelligence, Farahi brings a wealth of gambling industry knowledge and experience to the position.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to join the Kindbridge team and to be a part of their mission to improve the lives of people struggling with gambling and gaming disorders,” Farahi said, eager to start leveraging his gaming and healthcare industry experience “to help Kindbridge continue to innovate and provide the highest quality care for its patients.”</p>
<p>Leverage a Data-Driven Approach</p>
<p>Throughout his professional career, Farahi keenly demonstrated his ability to deliver guest experience improvements via a data-driven approach, as well as a wide range of skills in government relations, investor relations, and healthcare.</p>
<p>Currently licensed in dozens of US gaming jurisdictions, Kindbridge will be relying on his expertise in these areas to further its mission and advance consumer protections nationwide by embedding mental health services into the casino industry’s player journey.</p>
<p>Farahi also has legislative experience, having served as president of the Colorado Gaming Association from 2015 to 2021, where he was instrumental in the legislative agenda of the industry in Colorado, including three statewide ballot initiatives.</p>
<p>His other public and professional involvements include being a trustee of the Saint Joseph Hospital Foundation since 2020, a trustee of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and a member of the Young President’s Organization.</p>
<p>Last year, Kindbridge announced a ground-breaking mental health program in partnership with the NFL Players Association’s Professional Athletes Foundation aimed at improving the mental health resilience of players and providing vital mental health education.</p>
