    <h1>Casino Minneapolis Freeplay Casino Two Kings Casino Kansas City Casinos Va Casino BetMGM Becomes Las</h1>

<p>The joint venture of MGM Resorts International and GVC Holdings, BetMGM, announced Thursday a partnership deal with the National Football League (NFL) franchise Las Vegas Raiders. Under the terms of the partnership deal, BetMGM is now an Official Sports Betting Partner of the professional football team.</p>
<p>Extending Existing Partnership</p>
<p>The new deal is an extension of an existing multi-year partnership between MGM Resorts and the Raiders signed in January 2020, and as an official sports betting partner of the Raiders, BetMGM will gain access to fans of the NFL franchise to inform them about the BetMGM app. State residents who are willing to bet online should first register in-person by visiting any MGM Resorts sports book in the Sin City.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled that BetMGM is the first Official Sports Betting Partner of The Las Vegas Raiders. This new partnership complements what is already a wonderful and rewarding relationship with MGM Resorts and the Raiders and we look forward to introducing Raiders fans to the excitement of sports betting with BetMGM.” Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>MGM Presence at Allegiant Stadium</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is a founding partner of the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium, which features premier branding for the casino and hospitality operator with in-stadium signage and an MGM Resorts VIP entrance on the west side of the building. A private MGM Club offering Raiders’ fans exclusive game-viewing experience with bar services, luxury lounge and upgraded seating completes the presence of the Las Vegas casino company at the stadium.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to add BetMGM to the MGM Resorts partnership portfolio. The addition of BetMGM will open new levels of engagement for Raiders fans and guests of Allegiant Stadium.” Marc Badain, President, Las Vegas Raiders</p>
<p>September 21 the Allegiant Stadium which announced earlier in the month its intention to eliminate cash payments, will feature its first-ever regular season game and MGM Resorts is going to be the presenting sponsor of the Raiders.</p>
<p>“All of us at MGM Resorts are proud to welcome the Raiders and the NFL to Las Vegas. We look forward to providing Raiders fans a world-class sports betting and entertainment experience, both in our BetMGM Sportsbooks and digitally, through the BetMGM mobile app.” Bill Hornbuckle, CEO and President, MGM Resorts International</p>
<p>Responsible Gambling Initiative</p>
<p>Alongside their partnership, MGM and the Raiders collaborated in some outreach programs for the benefit of the communities in Southern Nevada, with responsible gaming remaining a key focus. Seeking to achieve positive, transparent and proactive conversations with players about how to gamble responsibly, an industry-leading program developed by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, GameSense, was introduced.</p>
<p>Each MGM property features an M life Rewards desk with trained staff, GameSense Advisors, available for personal interactions with players. Guests can also utilize at the desks interactive touch screens and educational materials.</p>
