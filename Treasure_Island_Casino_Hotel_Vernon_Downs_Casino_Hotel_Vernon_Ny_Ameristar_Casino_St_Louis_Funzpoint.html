<p>Money Train review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Players will get a ride into the Wild West with this slot.</p>
<p>Set in a rugged town in the blazing sun, Money Train has an immediately adventurous mood.</p>
<p>The characters lurking in the reels have a mysterious look about them, as if they have secrets to share with the player. Some of the characters lean into stereotypes that belong firmly in the world of fiction, however.</p>
<p>Overall, players will enjoy getting a ticket for this journey into the Old West.</p>
<p>Big win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The reels arrive dramatically on a rattling train car. The engine and other cars are animated with intriguing detail. Players will likely keep noticing new elements of the design each time they play.</p>
<p>As the game begins the shutters of the train car clatter up. Surrounded by rusty machinery, the reels seem part of a game players might find at a Wild West carnival.</p>
<p>A windmill slowly turns in the background, adding depth to the scene. The delicacy of the metalwork on the train enhances the realism world as well.</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a bouncing rhythm befitting a train journey. However, the jolly tone wears after some time and players may wish to leave it off.</p>
<p>The front end of this game impressively captures fun details that players will love.</p>
