<p>The trio were identified as Joseph J. Lodge, 18, Robert J. Diaz-Mendoza, 29, and Karla G. Ortega, 20. Each was being held in the Tehama County Jail, according to the Tehama County Sheriff’s Office. Bail for each suspect is $133K.</p>
<p>The carjacking took place last Saturday at the Corning, Calif. casino. The unnamed victim was in his car when the two male suspects ordered him to exit the vehicle.</p>
<p>They hopped in and drove the car away from the parking lot. The victim didn’t appear to suffer any injuries.</p>
<p>The stolen car was eventually located in Glenn County.</p>
<p>When the trio was apprehended for carjacking and being felons in possession of a firearm, they had in their possession another vehicle that was stolen in Chico. Calif., authorities said.</p>
<p>Deputies said they also found in their possession the firearm used in the Rollings Hills Casino carjacking.</p>
<p>At the time they were booked in the Tehama County Jail, each suspect allegedly had methamphetamine (meth) and/or fentanyl in their possession. Each was charged with bringing a controlled substance into the jail.</p>
<p>If convicted, the suspects could each face many years in prison.</p>
