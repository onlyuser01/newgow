<p>Shadow Esports has revealed the Esports Live Ticker, a new solution by the company that is designed to help various platforms to bolster their esports coverage and keep audiences in the moment and up to date with the latest developments in the esports scene across a few games and verticals.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports Powers the Esports Live Ticker</p>
<p>The Esports Live Ticker is based on Bayes Esports technology which is powering it and will offer a scoreboard for free. This will give audiences a quick breakdown of the current state of individual games with more information available to companies.</p>
<p>The new solution should help media platforms really benefit from providing their readers and users with in-depth statistics that are updated in real-time and provides maximum value to esports aficionados. To access the in-depth data, media publishers would need to access one of the premium options, which comes with strong incentives for the players.</p>
<p>Shadow Esports head of new business Bonny Leyser welcomed the arrival and launch of the Esports Live Ticker, arguing that the time is right to pursue such projects given how prominent competitive video gaming has become. Leyser added:</p>
<p>Our Esports Live Tricker allows more media outlets to create engaging esports content and reach out to a new audience that is increasingly straying away from more traditional sports. Shadow Esports head of new business Bonny Leyser</p>
<p>According to Leyser, the Esports Live Tricker will be a powerful tool in the arsenal of media publishers who are seeking to retain first-time visitors and convert them into loyal followers. Media companies that cover esports are increasingly seeing the value in providing such a breakdown of competitive gaming events, as the interest in esports betting is growing proportionately.</p>
<p>The news comes just as Entain has announced that it has relaunched Unikrn, one of the most prominent esports betting brands, and is now planning to expand into further markets over the coming months and years. Entain purchased Unikrn last year for a sum total of Â£50 million and kept the project under tight wraps before relaunching. As to Bayes Esports, the company recently became an authorized supplier in New Jersey and Colorado.</p>
