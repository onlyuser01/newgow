    <h1>Casino In Branson Mo Hollywood Casino Tunica Parkwest Casino 580 Pit Boss Casino Coeur D Alene Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Jaime Correa and first of all I would like to thank you for the service offered by Casino Gur√∫ to fight against injustices in the sector.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago I opened an account at 888starz.bet where I deposited approximately 10,000 USDT (it is a website that works with cryptocurrencies). In a short time I lost everything and decided to put in approximately 5,000 USDT more, which I also lost. However, I made some low-amount withdrawals to transfer from one bookmaker to another and the security department demanded a photo of my ID and my credit card (covering some numbers). The verification was approved and the withdrawal was successful.</p>
<p>At this point, I did not stop receiving emails from the VIP department to keep depositing and offering me different bonuses (I understand that it was very lucrative for them). Under these conditions, I decided to deposit 1,500 USDT more which turned into 35,000 USDT within a few weeks. When I went to withdraw part of my winnings they were rejected and they asked me to contact the security department.</p>
<p>The security department asked me again for a selfie photo with my ID and my email inbox (where the conversations with the department in question came out). I had to send about 8 different images because they all had a problem from their point of view. Once the photographs were approved, they informed me, two days later, that they accused me of FRAUD and, as it goes against their terms and conditions, they would proceed to cancel all bets and close my account.</p>
<p>I consider this to be one more excuse for not paying my earnings. In fact, there are many people in the same situation as I have been able to read in different forums. Also, they only let me withdraw the 1,500 USDT from the last deposit.</p>
<p>In fact, at the start of the verification I recorded this video where I shared my fear that something dishonest would be done to me (as I had seen on Trustpilot).</p>
<p>After verification, when my funds were withdrawn, I recorded this other video .</p>
<p>In the last email from the security department, where they inform me of the cancellation of all my bets, I am also told that all the answers I make in relation to this issue will be ignored. Consequently, I have filed a complaint with the National Police and opened different complaints such as CasinoMeister or AskGamblers.</p>
<p>As they accuse me of fraud, and it goes against the terms and conditions, AskGamblers informed me that they could not help me since they cannot mediate in the terms and conditions that I have previously accepted.</p>
<p>CasinoMeister has not given me an answer yet.</p>
<p>Following the advice of AskGamblers, I have also opened a dispute with the Master License of 888Starz (Antillephone) but I have not read positive things about their mediations.</p>
<p>I worry that this will come to nothing and that all my effort and money has been wasted. For this reason I will not stop until justice is done and I would love to have your help.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, I am at your disposal,</p>
<p>James.</p>
