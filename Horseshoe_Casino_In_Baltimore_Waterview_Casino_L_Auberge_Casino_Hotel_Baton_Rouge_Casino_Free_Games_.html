<p>Thunderkick, the up-and-coming studio and developer of innovative iGaming content, has stolen another regional march by expanding into Latin America</p>
<p>The company is now bringing its robust portfolio of games in the region through a partnership with Rush Street Interactive, and the company’s Rushbet brand that operates in Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico Becomes Gateway for Thunderkick LatAm Expansion</p>
<p>Players in Mexico will access a wide variety of games provided by Thunderkick to the operator, bringing titles such as Midas Golden Touch, Carnival Queen, and the player-favorite Esqueleto Explosivo 2 into focus and at the library.</p>
<p>The partnership with Rushbet is important to both the operator and the supplier. Rushbet, for its part, is one of the most prominent online casino and sportsbook brands in the Mexican market. The company won silverware from 2021’s SBC Latinoamérica Awards and offers the largest library of casino games in the region.</p>
<p>Thunderkick is similarly happy to continue with what is part of its global expansion, as the company has been doubling down on growth in key regulated markets. Recently, the supplier teamed up with Jumpman Gaming in the United Kingdom and Interwetten in Germany, demonstrating its unfaltering commitment to expanding its reach and pull in regulated markets.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Thunderkick head of sales Fredrik Ekholm welcomed the opportunity to see the company expand in Latin America with a prominent brand such as Rushbet, which he called the exciting and renowned operator, adding:</p>
<p>Not only is the LatAm market a key focus for us, but this partnership will also see more players than ever enjoying our fantastic collection of games. We’re excited to see what Rushbet’s player base thinks. Thunderkick head of sales Fredrik Ekholm</p>
<p>Rushbet Welcomes Arrival of Trusted and Player-Favorite Supplier</p>
<p>Rushbet RSI CEO Richard Schwartz was similarly excited to welcome this fresh opportunity. He spoke highly of Thunderkick’s offer, which featured a selection of high-performing slots and was delighted to see them brought to Rushbet’s shopping windows.</p>
<p>“Their approach to slot-making is refreshing and we fully expect our players to enjoy the entertaining games,” Schwartz said and added that Rushbet remains committed to expanding in the Latin American region, something that is now going to be easier with Thunderkick’s help.</p>
<p>Thunderkick recently expanded its reach in Sweden with Bethard and Fastbet, continuing to grow its presence.</p>
