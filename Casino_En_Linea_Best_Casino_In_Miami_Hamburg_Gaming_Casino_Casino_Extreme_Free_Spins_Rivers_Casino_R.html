<p>Betfred has much in common with the league, which is why this partnership has been so successful</p>
<p>Leading betting operator Betfred has announced an extension of its partnership with the Super League, the top-flight rugby league in Europe and the United Kingdom. As a result, the gambling company will continue to serve as a sponsor for another three years.</p>
<p>The operator first joined forces with the league in 2017. Eventually, the two parties expanded the deal to also cover men’s and women’s wheelchair rugby, the English national team and the Challenge Cup.</p>
<p>The current deal extension will see Betfred increase its sponsorship by 25% and include a unique new full-size pitch covering for the Wheelchair Rugby League. The pitch will be used for the first time during the upcoming Wheelchair Super League Grand Final in Manchester and then at the World Cup final between England and France in Leeds next month.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Betfred and the Rugby Football League will continue to promote safer gambling across the world of rugby. The renewal of the partnership between Betfred and the Super League also takes into account the principles of the recently proposed Sports Sponsorship Code.</p>
<p>This Is One of Betfred’s Most Significant Partnerships</p>
<p>Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commercial commented on the partnership, praising its significance to the rugby sector. Jones noted that Betfred has much in common with the league, which is why this partnership has been so successful.</p>
<p>The MD also thanked Betfred for its support during the pandemic and the operator’s increased support of the sector. Thanks to the operator’s unwavering backing, the league has now re-emerged stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Jones concluded:</p>
<p>This deal is surely unique in including a bespoke pitch-covering which provides such exciting opportunities for Wheelchair Rugby League to continue its growth since last year’s World Cup triumph. It is another tangible example of Betfred’s support of all levels of Rugby League. Rhodri Jones, MD, RL Commercial</p>
<p>Betfred’s chairman, Fred Done, said that his company’s partnership with the Rugby League is one of its most successful ones.</p>
<p>The sport has been working tirelessly to become one of the most inclusive in the world and it is important that this includes the Men’s, Women’s and Wheelchair versions of the game, so I am delighted to be able to provide the new pitch covering for Wheelchair Rugby League to help with this. Fred Done, founder &amp; chair, Betfred</p>
<p>Done concluded that he is looking forward to continuing his work with the league.</p>
