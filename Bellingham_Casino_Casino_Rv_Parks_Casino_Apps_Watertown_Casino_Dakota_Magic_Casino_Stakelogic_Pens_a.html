<p>The critically-acclaimed slot games developer Stakelogic is pressing hard on the European market. To further its expansion, the name behind some of the best new slot games has inked a new deal with the Danske Spil – a popular Danish online casino.</p>
<p>Danske Spil to Receive Stakelogic’s Full Suite of Offerings</p>
<p>Through this agreement, Danske Spil will get access to all of Stakelogic’s slot games, providing its fans with the hottest titles in slots. Danish bettors will be able to play some of the highest-rated slot games, such as Apes of Doom, Black Gold 2 Megaways, and Joker Drop.</p>
<p>Danske Spil will also get access to chosen titles from Greenlogic Partner Program – an initiative run by Stakelogic where it supplies game logic and back-office integration for boutique software developers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to the deal, Danske Spil players will be able to enjoy the Super Stake mode that allows them to gain various game boons for boosting their starting stake. Some of the games which will have this high-risk, high-reward system will be Extreme Megaways, Jade Of The Jungle, and Lucky Gold.</p>
<p>The Parties Are Optimistic about the Future</p>
<p>Both Danske Spil and Stakelogic are content to work together and bring a plethora of exciting new slots titles to fans of the Danish casino.</p>
<p>Christian Bækgaard, the head of product for Danske Spil, has expressed his delight in being able to work alongside Stakelogic. He said that the whole casino’s team is thrilled to be able to host the developer’s full suite of slots. In his words, the new deal will provide Danske Spil players with “an even greater choice of gaming options” and will further cement the casino as a leading Danish brand.</p>
<p>Olga Bajela, the chief commercial officer of Stakelogic, said that moving forward and not staying still is a fundamental pillar in the company’s philosophy. For Bajela, the partnership with Danske Spil attests that Stakelogic is moving forward and also reinforces the company’s commitment to ensuring that players across Europe have the chance to try its exciting collection of slot games. Bajela added:</p>
<p>“Danske Spil are one of the best-known casino brands in Denmark and now that we’ve teamed up with them, players from the country will get to experience the full range of innovative gameplay features our slots provide, including Super Stake, Dual Reels and the popular Popwins mechanic.”</p>
<p>Stakelogic is not only the name behind some of the hot in-demand slots titles but also a steadily growing brand that has been focused on targeting the European market. The company has an existing partnership deal with the Ukrainian giant Parimatch. Additionally, just a few days ago, the slot games developer expanded to the Italian market through a deal with Betsson’s StarCasino brand.</p>
