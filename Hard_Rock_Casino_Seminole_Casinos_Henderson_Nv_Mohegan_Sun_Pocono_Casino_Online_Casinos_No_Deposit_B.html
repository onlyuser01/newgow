    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Seminole Casinos Henderson Nv Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino Online Casinos No Deposit B</h1>

<p>I had been grinding Jammin Jars2 for a couple of months and thousands and thousands of spins later I had nearly completed Level 4 with just a couple of discs to go. I still would have to carry on to trigger the mega jar. I log in today and find this game had been removed. This was their answer and pointed me to the terms and conditions.</p>

<p>4.1 Access to our Website is permitted on a temporary basis, and we reserve the right to withdraw, suspend or amend any aspect or feature of the Website without notice.

<p>Surely the line in brackets is in breach of their own terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Can this be a complaint?. How can this be fair?. Can anything be done about it?</p>
<p>I feel so cheated as to me it is just theft from Ladbrokes having spent all that money and not being allowed to complete the game.</p>
