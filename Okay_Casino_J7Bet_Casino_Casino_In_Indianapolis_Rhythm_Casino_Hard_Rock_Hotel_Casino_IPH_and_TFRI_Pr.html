<p>Ireland’s Institute of Public Health (IPH) and TobaccoFree Research Institute Ireland (TFRI) have published the “Children and gambling – evidence to inform regulation and responses in Ireland” report. The study provides evidence of underage gambling in the country, highlighting its extent. The report also investigates the relationship between gambling harm and socio-demographic background and probes into the effects of various gambling verticals.</p>
<p>One of the main outcomes of the study shows that, concerningly, around 22.9% of 16-year-olds had gambled at least once in the last 12 months. Boys were almost twice as likely to have gambled, with 28.2% confirming to have done so. Around 17.9% of girls had also played at least once in that time frame.</p>
<p>Underage players tended to live in families with lower educational attainment and would often have lower academic performances themselves. In addition, they are likely to have parents who are less aware of their whereabouts and are regular consumers of social media. In addition, such players are likely to drink, smoke or use cannabis, with some of them having a record of having been in trouble with the police.</p>
<p>Notably, many of these underage gamblers would engage in gambling at least once a month.</p>
<p>Other Interesting Findings</p>
<p>The most popular gambling vertical among underage players was sports betting at 60.7%, followed by lotteries at 51.8%. Another 41.3% said they’d engage in card or dice games, while 36.9% would play slots.</p>
<p>As if the data wasn’t concerning enough, the study shows that 10.3% of the 16-year-olds who gambled did so excessively. Furthermore, 5.6% of underage gamblers fit the criteria for problem gambling.</p>
<p>Boys were much more likely to experience excessive gambling and problem gambling, the study says. For reference, 14.1% of the boys were categorized as excessive gamblers against 4.5% of the girls, while 7.5% of the boys were considered problem gamblers against 2.8% of the girls.</p>
<p>Experts Are Concerned</p>
<p>The study was addressed by Dr Helen McAvoy, director of policy at the IPH. She said that the report highlights the importance of intervention, pointing out that many of the young players “run into difficulty.”</p>
<p>She added that the gambling rates among this demographic are in line with the average in Europe and noted that a public health approach is needed.</p>
<p>James Browne, Minister for State with responsibility for Law Reform and Youth Justice, also commented on the matter, calling the results “deeply troubling.” He echoed McAvoy’s words, saying that the matter must be addressed.</p>
