<p>Dear Basel,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://emojino.com/terms-of-use:</p>

<p>You are aware that the right to access and use the Website and any products there offered, may be considered illegal in certain countries.
