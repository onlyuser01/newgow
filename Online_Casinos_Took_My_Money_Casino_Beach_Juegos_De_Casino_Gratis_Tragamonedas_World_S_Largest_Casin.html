    <h1>Online Casinos Took My Money Casino Beach Juegos De Casino Gratis Tragamonedas World S Largest Casin</h1>

<p>Black Lotus has the following term:</p>
<p>6.2 Match Bonus offers greater than 100% are subject to a maximum withdrawal amount of $1,000 and need to be wagered through 60X. The remaining balance will be voided.</p>
<p>The issue with this, is if you deposit $1,000 and use a bonus multiplier, it is impossible to win, with the maximum return being your initial deposit.</p>
<p>Such a term should not be allowed, as it gives players that deposit lower amounts a different implied return than for players who deposit $1,000 (no possible return). There should be no such discrimination allowed to penalize a player depositing more money.</p>
<p>Having not seen the inconspicuous line of text quoted above, I deposited $1,000 and met all other playthrough requirements (60x with a 4.55x bonus) (I was forced to wager $273,000) on slots and made a profit of $14,821.</p>
<p>Since this bonus should have not been allowed to be on my account in good faith, as it gave me literally 0% chance to win, it should be retroactively removed. I was never down even $1 at any point (I have all of the playthrough history), I should get to keep the entirety of my winnings less the bonus.</p>
<p>Additionally, the above term should be removed or revised from the website, as this is a large discrimination between different types of players (high stakes versus low states), and dramatically changes the odds that a player would receive. A casino's bonus should never limit a player into receiving no profit, even under the best circumstances, and instead should be issued in good faith.</p>
<p>The Company initially allowed me to withdraw all $15,821. I spoke with two representatives who gave no indication that there might be an issue. This withdraw was pending for 48 hours and was "processed" before an admin reversed the transaction and sent me $1,000 via BTC (which was my initial deposit). The rest of my funds have been confiscated. This is not an acceptable outcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Seth</p>
