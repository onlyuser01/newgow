<p>Bastet and Cats review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on Egyptian mythology, especially the cat-like goddess Bastet.</p>
<p>Players arrive in a warm desert to see pyramids, sand and palms. With the guidance of a plucky goddess with cat ears, they’ll set their sights on gleaming treasures.</p>
<p>This game definitely adds a modern twist to ancient Egyptian mythology, but those looking for an exotic escape may welcome the fantasy.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a mystical Middle Eastern melody with slow drum beats and flutes. Players will have no doubt they are in a time and place far away. The mournful track seems somewhat at odds with the cheerful animations, but it is so relaxing that players will probably opt to leave it on.</p>
<p>The hostess of the game, Bastet, seems more like a teen in a costume than an immortal goddess. She seems to be a hybrid of kitten and Bratz Doll, animated in the style of a Pixar film. Nonetheless, her friendly face and swaying tail make the game a welcoming place to be. When players win, Bastet does a dance for joy, making it clear that she is on the players’ side.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will see glowing-eyed cats, scarab beetles, panthers, mummies and Bastet herself. Each one is animated with impressive detail and players will enjoy the enchanting art style.</p>
<p>The backdrop is breathtaking with its rolling sands, pyramids in the distance and moody orange sky. The heat of the desert is easy to feel and players will enjoy the immersive sensation.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Bastet and Cats is a five reel, four row slot with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>The Gamble feature is offered after each spin and allows players to risk their winnings to go straight into the Free Spins feature, or to buy directly into the feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When 5 or more Scatters land, players will either receive a random coin prize or a random number of free spins.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations will vanish to make way for new symbols. During each cascade a win multiplier increases. Cascades take place in both the base game and during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95%, decisively below our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, low volatility Egyptian mythology-themed slot.</p>
<p>With its unattractive volatility and depressing RTP, this game is simply not a wise choice.</p>
<p>The charms this theme has are not able to redeem this subpar option.</p>
