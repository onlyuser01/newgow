    <h1>Jack Party Casino Lake Charles Golden Nugget Casino Casino Poconos Pennsylvania Casino And Restauran</h1>

<p>Supplier of iGaming and betting software NuxGame has signed a new partnership with Platipus Gaming, a dedicated developer of content for the industry. Through this new partnership, NuxGame partners will have access to Platipus’ series of innovative content and titles.</p>
<p>Platipus Gaming Now Part of NuxGame’s Offer</p>
<p>Platipus Gaming has specialized in the development of crypto-friendly games along with standard iGaming propositions. The studio has been around since 2014 and operates out of the United Kingdom. It develops and crafts beautifully-animated and mobile-friendly games on HTMl5.</p>
<p>The company has been able to expand into other parts of the experience as well, including table games, over the last years. As a result, the studio offers more than 80 slot and table games, translated into 18 languages, and works with a number of FIAT and mainstream cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new partnership, NuxGame will be able to continue building up a portfolio of content partners that can be implemented immediately with any partner operator. NuxGame has been working hard to ensure that its offer is stronger each month.</p>
<p>The company previously arranged a similar partnership with Ezugi and it joined QTech Games, to give its offer a further boost. NuxGame also has a partnership with Smartico.ai enabling the company to deploy an intuitive CRM automation platform for added efficiency and reliability.</p>
<p>Platipus Confident to Reach New Audiences with NuxGame</p>

Forming these agreements with other distinguished brands is a core pillar of our growth strategy, and we couldn’t be more excited to see where this collaboration will take us.
