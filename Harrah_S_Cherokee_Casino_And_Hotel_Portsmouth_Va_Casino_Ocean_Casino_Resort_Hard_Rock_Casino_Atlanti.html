<p>30 Spicy Fruits is a video slot coming from EGT. The slot has a simple design with stacked symbols and a free spins bonus round where players can score up to 30 free spins. Playing the slot can be a real enjoyment thanks to the frequent wins on the screen and the potential for bigger payouts in the bonus round. Like in most other EGT slots players have a chance to score one of the four attached jackpots.</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>As you can already guess from the slot name 30 Spicy Fruits comes with a fruit theme. The game also has a classic tone thanks to the Bars and Sevens symbols, while the spiciness comes from the Red Hot Chili Wild symbol. The symbols in the slot are well designed, with a few modern animations added to make it appealing to the eye.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>One detail which is common to all EGT slots is the fast gameplay. What makes the gameplay interesting in 30 Spicy Fruits are the stacked symbols. Thanks to this players can score a full screen of matching symbols and without a doubt a big payout.</p>
<p>If you like to spice up your gameplay, you can raise the volatility with the standard gamble function.</p>
<p>It's easy to hit multiple winlines with stacked symbols</p>
<p>Bet size, RTP and variance</p>
<p>30 Spicy Fruits is a fixed 30 payline slot, so the bet size can range anywhere from $0.30 up to $150 per spin.</p>
<p>The top payout combination comes from the Wild symbol, awarding a payout of 33 times the total stake for landing 5 of them on a winning payline. But players have a chance to land a full screen of Wilds with a top payout of 990 times the total stake in a single spin.</p>
<p>The slot comes with an RTP value of 95% and a medium to high variance, which could be well combined with our preferred strategies.</p>

<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>Like we mentioned earlier, all of the game symbols can land stacked across the reels. This includes the Wild and Scatter symbols, which can result in a full screen of Wilds and a big payout.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can land as a stacked symbol only on reels 2, 3 and 4. You will need to land 7, 8 or 9 Scatters on these central reels in order to trigger the free spins bonus. The player will get 7, 15 or 30 free spins accordingly which can be re-triggered on any spin, providing that another set of 7 or more scatters hit the reels.</p>
<p>The jackpot game in 30 Spicy Fruits can be triggered randomly on any given spin. When this happens the player will need to choose from 12 cards on the screen and match 3 of them. The card suit which is matched corresponds to one of the four jackpots.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>30 Spicy Fruits is a simple but attractive video slot coming from the EGT portfolio, offering higher than average variance. We could recommend this slot, if the RTP was little bit higher.</p>
<p>With its modern 30 payline design and attractive free spins bonus 30 Spicy Fruits can award payouts of up to 990 times the total stake per spin. If thatâ€™s not enough, with some luck on your side, you can trigger the jackpot game and win one of the four attached jackpots.</p>
