<p>Peat is excited to join Rank Group at such an pivotal point for the gambling company and its digital division</p>
<p>Rank Group, a UK-based gambling company, has expanded its team with a new managing director of its Rank Interactive division. The one up to the task is the experienced Andrew Peat who will take up the role later in 2023.</p>
<p>Peat is no stranger to the betting industry and is currently a sportsbook director at the leading operator William Hill. He has served in this position since 2018, helping the brand expand its presence in the UK.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Peat occupied directorial positions at other non-gambling companies. He served as the commercial director of Dixons Carphone Group, following a stint as the commercial propositions director of the tech startup Ctrlio.</p>
<p>As managing director of Rank Group, Peat will be responsible for the development and execution of the company’s UK-facing digital strategy. He will support the rest of the team from the company’s office in Gibraltar and will work directly under Jon Martin.</p>
<p>Martin, for reference, is Rank Group’s newly-appointed chief operating officer, who will be joining the company this summer.</p>
<p>Martin Looks Forward to Welcoming Peat on Board</p>
<p>Andrew Peat commented on his new position, noting that he is joining Rank Group at a pivotal time for its digital business. The decision to join, he said, was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Peat praised everything the company has built in the last few years. He lauded Rank’s own proprietary technology and its Interactive team of engaged professionals.</p>
<p>My ambition to deliver an exceptional cross-channel experience for Rank customers in both gaming and sports is clearly shared by the team and I am looking forward to getting started. Andrew Peat, MD, Rank Interactive</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jon Martin welcomed Peat to the company. He said that the addition of such an experienced worker is “great news” for the company.</p>
<p>Securing an operator of Andrew’s caliber is great news for Rank. His experience in sports and gaming, along with his track record in delivering cross-channel improvements at one of the biggest sportsbook brands in the UK bodes well for the important job he will soon be undertaking in Gibraltar. Jon Martin, COO, Rank Interactive</p>
<p>Martin explained that the appointment of Peat will help Rank Interactive capitalize on the momentum it currently has. The future COO said that he is looking forward to working with Peat once he joins the company later this year.</p>
<p>In January, Rank Group published its interim H1 results, highlighting the impact of high costs and slow recovery. The company’s slowdown was attributed to a contraction in the UK market.</p>
