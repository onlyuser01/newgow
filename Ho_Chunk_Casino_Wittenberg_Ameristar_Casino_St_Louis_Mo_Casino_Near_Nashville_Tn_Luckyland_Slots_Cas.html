    <h1>Ho Chunk Casino Wittenberg Ameristar Casino St Louis Mo Casino Near Nashville Tn Luckyland Slots Cas</h1>

<p>PLEASE HELP!!! BEFORE COMPLAINTING IN THE COMMISSIONER!!! I want to tell what I am suffering with bet365, my user is; rositahuelva, it's been more than 10 years since I joined bet365 and I never had a problem, I spent years without playing anything, and about two months ago I started to deposit 10 euros from time to time to have a kitchen and play roulette, about 400 euros, I am unemployed, which is a lot of money for me, I put that money in to try my luck and it turns out that I have not played the money nor can I withdraw it nor have I access to my account for ONE MONTH!!!, I went to get in a month ago and it turns out that I couldn't, they didn't even notify me, I had to write to see what was happening and then they asked me to send a certificate of ownership, ID, cards with which I deposit, and the income fund with which I financed my gaming account, EVERYTHING SENT I sent the unemployment that unemployment paid me, my cards with which I deposit my ID, each and every one of the things that they asked me for, after weeks and weeks telling me that it is being verified by the corresponding department and closing the chat in I live without giving them solutions of any kind without saying goodbye even yesterday I told them that I am going to report them to the police station, and attention!!! Do you know what's new so you don't give me money? They tell me that they can't give me my money if I don't send away the old cards with which I deposited 8 years ago!!!!! It turns out that I used Bankia at the time and according to them I have to send them a strajetas expired years ago and some bank accounts from years ago that I neither use nor have saved or anything, and even so they tell me to look for my life and to call a bank that It doesn't even exist anymore so that I can send a copy of the cards I used, I have spoken with the game organization and they tell me that they don't ask for cards older than 5 years, used on the page, that there is a limit, but bet365 yes, everything to not give me my sad 400 euros, which for me are a lot, and one of them has told me that he is going to open an incident to claim my money because it is absurd but very absurd that they ask you for a card from more than 8 years ago to open your account again but very absurd, the only thing I see here is that many people will get tired of these procedures and it is a way for them to keep the agent's money that they get bored, but you take it clear with me, because I have already communicated my case to the press, youtube, and I hope that the way you have to proceed with people will even come out on television, one month!!!! It took me a month for my account to open. I asked them for my money and they closed the account. I don't care about their account anymore. I don't even want to play with them. I will never deposit at bet365 again and they tell me no, I won't be able to withdraw otherwise I send a card from more than 8 years ago that I do not have that bank nor does that bank exist and it is even a real shame! Let bet365 know that you are being denounced as of today, and that I am going to fight for what is fair and for my money and if this can be of use to someone, please read it.</p>
