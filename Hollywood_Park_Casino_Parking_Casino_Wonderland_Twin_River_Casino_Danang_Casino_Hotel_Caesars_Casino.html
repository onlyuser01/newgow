    <h1>Hollywood Park Casino Parking Casino Wonderland Twin River Casino Danang Casino Hotel Caesars Casino</h1>

<p>I decided to gamble with Mr. Green casino through its website given its high rating. On 2/10/23, I deposited 25 USD with a matching bonus of the same amount. While I was playing, I started the verification process, during which I sent my required documents via several emails to id@mrgreen.com. On 8/10/23, I received an email from atencionalcliente@mrgreen.es which theoretically confirmed the completion of my verification. However, I also received text messages asking me to send my documents for verification within a maximum period of 5 days. Since the messages contained a link that led nowhere, I decided to ignore them, especially since the confirmation of my verification had been emailed to me. During those days, I earned a total of 2107.95 USD, of which 402.87 USD was from the bonus. When a withdrawal is made, the bonus disappears, leaving 1705.08 USD of real money, which I proceeded to withdraw upon confirmation of my account verification. It's important to note that one can only withdraw when they have a verified account. Coincidentally, this was on the same day as the text message's deadline. Just a few hours ago, I received a text message stating that my account was blocked and asking me to send the documents if I wanted it to be unblocked. I have not received any email requesting additional documents. I am theorizing that they must have issues with their database as they contradict themselves between affirming they have all the documents and stating otherwise. I would like my account to be unblocked and my withdrawn money to be granted.</p>
<p>I managed to upload all the screenshots that I could, the rest are here:</p>
