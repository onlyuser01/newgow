<p>BetMGM is gearing up for the football season, bringing new opportunities to sports bettors interested in placing a wager on one of the biggest sports events on the calendar</p>
<p>The operator is determined to create new experiences for players, offering 50% live odds boosts as one of the many promos to get fans going. The renewed app was also welcomed by BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt who was happy to see one of the leading apps in the United States make it even more exciting for fans to participate and enjoy sports betting.</p>
<p>BetMGM Committed to Making the NFL More Enjoyable</p>
<p>“We developed our sports betting platform to offer various ways for sports fans to engage. The next version of the BetMGM app is a step forward in the sports betting experience,” Greenblatt said. The launch of the improved app also comes with the free Survivor Pool which features a $100,000 prize for the winner.</p>
<p>This campaign allows users to pick one team for free every week and see how many points they score based on said team’s performance. The same team cannot be picked twice during a season. Fans need not worry about their traveling during the NFL season, as they will be able to access their apps and accounts in those states that have licensed and regulated sports betting online where BetMGM is available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BetMGM is also forging ahead with the 8-Bit Barry Game which includes the company’s celebrity ambassador, Barry Sanders. Players will be able to pick various moves for Sanders and earn rewards based on his performance. That includes parlay boost tokens, odds boost tokens, insurance tokens, and much more.</p>
<p>Bringing Parlays, Live Odds Boosts, and More</p>
<p>Accepting the challenge from other brands, BetMGM is also running through with the Same-Game Parlay+, which will give players even more betting options and the opportunity to enjoy more entertaining bet types across the board.</p>
<p>BetMGM will also leverage its 50% live odds boost tokens to bettors in the home states of teams that the company has partnerships with, including the Baltimore Ravens, the Denver Broncos, the Detroit Lions, the Arizona Cardinals, the New York Jets, and the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>All of this comes with the sportsbook’s customary welcome bonuses and free bonuses that will complement the experience for the NFL season.</p>
