    <h1>Horseshoe Casino In Las Vegas Casino San Francisco Casino In Sacramento Choctaw Casinos Resorts Choc</h1>

<p>So I deposited €25 into this casino and even though I didn’t want it was unknowingly given a €25 deposit bonus. With this money I then gambled my way all the way up to €3111.09. Whilst I had issue with this casino in terms of verification and there lack of communication and customer support I finally got the verification sorted. Now the bonus was €25 and the way this casino works is it gave me a certain amount of points to gamble to, the target was 750. And that is what I reached. I met the bonus and the casino had been giving me these points as I was gambling €50,€25,€100, even more valuable bets. Because I had done what the casino required and I had no active bonus which they require to be complete to make a withdrawal. I decided to remove my winnings. Earlier today I then get an email from the casino saying I breached there bonus policy and they voided my withdrawal and winning and gave me €150 as compensation. I don’t know what kind of joke this is to them. Like that’s gonna compensate €3000. They explained the bonus policy to me afterwards. But how come whenever I was gambling the money from my real money balance would always go down but never the bonus balance. Therefore I was gambling with my own money the whole time and I got that €3111 with my own money not the bonus money. I have asked for a better reason and for them to explain to me how that is a breach of policy and that I would be happy to get back the €3111 and do the bonus how they’d like even though as I was gambling they were giving me points for the bonus and how did the computer not pick up on this so called breach? Happily wager what they want for this stupid €25. Imagine losing €3000 because of a €25 bet you didn’t want and didn’t use. Casino guru this is a serious situation and your help is much needed. Ye have an influence here and I will bring this to the required authorities.</p>
