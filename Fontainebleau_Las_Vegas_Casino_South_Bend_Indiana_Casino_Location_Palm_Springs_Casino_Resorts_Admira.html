    <h1>Fontainebleau Las Vegas Casino South Bend Indiana Casino Location Palm Springs Casino Resorts Admira</h1>

<p>Rushbet mx sent me an email with a bonus worth $100.00 Mexican pesos, since at some point I registered with them.</p>
<p>That same day I started playing it just as a form of entertainment without expecting earnings, what a surprise that I released</p>
<p>the bonus satisfactorily fulfilling the terms that Rush requests, and that I have read in detail,</p>
<p>I kept playing until I considered a considerable $3,000 Mexican pesos for withdrawal.</p>
<p>Since I had real money in my balance, I prepared to request the withdrawal for the first time. and according to its terms an initial deposit is not necessary, in any case if it had been the case, I would not have any problem. Provide the interbank key</p>
<p>from my personal bbva account as they request. They immediately sent me a message to verify my identity with just the Ine.</p>
<p>During this period I was visiting my son's house, in another state, and I did not have the physical document at hand, and a photo of the screen was easy for me, since I had never requested a similar procedure.</p>
<p>The withdrawal request was canceled and I was notified,</p>
<p>like the automatic verification was failed.</p>
<p>I accept and acknowledge up to this point, being guilty for not waiting for my car identification to be brought to me.</p>
<p>After what happened, I read the terms and conditions where it is indicated that the validation can be done again and they offer service alternatives. I took my cell phone to take the picture and a selfie, and I prepared myself in case it was a live validation... at first they asked me to recognize the device by email or phone number and I did it without problem.</p>
<p>I contacted live chat support for validation support and they asked me to wait 1 hour. More than 24 hours have passed and still no response.</p>
<p>Days later I receive an email indicating that my account was permanently closed and that I could not dispose of the amount due to legal, legal and other breaches.</p>
<p>All based on 1 criteria. I could accept it without problem, acknowledging my mistake. However, the email they sent me details false accusations against me.</p>
<p>false information and procedures that were never allowed to me, since if that had been the case, without any problem I would have successfully validated it with all disposition. I am not committing any crime as they accuse me, based on this I have been branded as fraudulent and mocking perhaps without intentions of third parties to whom I speak.</p>
<p>I can understand that it was initially my mistake, but they have NOT given me a chance to remedy it.</p>
<p>His verdict that includes defamation and accusations that are totally false have marked me with damage to my honor, my integrity and dignity as a human being.</p>
<p>Without affirming it, but based on comments and based on what I am not allowed to, I suspect that what the bookmaker really did not want is to pay the $3,000 pesos since I did not invest at all, and I am considered a non-potential customer, and it's a loss to them.</p>
<p>There are testimonials that indicate something similar but do nothing about it, so it is easy for the casino to create this scenario since they do not receive a response other than simply ignore.</p>
<p>I am accused of fraud and having different accounts for the misuse of benefits like this, and even financial crimes.</p>
<p>I asked them more than once for the opportunity to validate my identity, and was denied.</p>
<p>I accept their terms and conditions, however they are not.</p>
<p>I let them know the disposition that I had on the subject and I was denied and they only tried to intimidate me.</p>
<p>I don't know much about issues like this, but it is an injustice.</p>
<p>I do not intend to take monetary advantage, or similar ... it is not the intention, I just want to be respected and paid what my account had in real money</p>
<p>that they release the bonus, that they respect that part. and that they give me the opportunity to prove to them that their accusations are false.</p>
<p>I do not consider myself a person with gambling problems, the activity was carried out only as a means of entertainment and it did not affect anyone,</p>
<p>I am an honest and ethical citizen. and for this reason I do not like to remain silent. I attach the evidence and I remain at your disposal, any request please let me know, I trust that you will support me and I will respect any decision made.</p>
<p>thanks in advance, regards</p>
