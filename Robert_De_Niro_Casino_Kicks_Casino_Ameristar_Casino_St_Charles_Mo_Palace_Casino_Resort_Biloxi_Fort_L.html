<p>AC Milan’s Only Chance to Salvage the Season</p>
<p>AC Milan are the reigning champions of the Italian Serie A, but it’s almost 100% certain they won’t retain the title. The point gap between them and the table leaders Napoli is just too large, not to mention that there are a couple of teams in-between them. AC Milan are also out of Coppa Italia, after getting knocked out by Torino a month ago.</p>
<p>What this practically means is that their only chance of salvaging the 2022-23 season is to do well in the Champions League. The trouble is that their recent form suggests they’re going to get demolished by Tottenham.</p>
<p>This team has been in horrible form for weeks, the main reason for which is that several of their key men are out with injuries. Some of them have returned to the squad, but some are still sidelined, including their first-choice goalkeeper Mike Maignan.</p>
<p>In his absence, Ciprian Tatarusanu has been between the posts. With him as their goalie, AC Milan are conceding over 2 goals per game in 2023.</p>
<p>Tottenham Coach Antonio Conte Might Return on Tuesday</p>
<p>Antonio Conte ended up in the hospital last week due to problems with his gallbladder. Because of that, he had to miss the game with Manchester City, which his team ended up winning 1-0. Although they didn’t put on a vintage performance that evening, they did grab all three points.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, however, he could make his comeback. With him by the sidelines, the Spurs are likely to play better. But can they beat AC Milan in Italy? Their away record suggests they can pull it off. The last time they played on the road in the Champions League, they defeated Marseille 2-1.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are great in the offense, which is why we expect to witness a real spectacle on Tuesday. We think there will be at least a goal on each end, but we’re not sure who’s going to win. Actually, we believe that the most likely outcome of this game is a draw.</p>
<p>Picks: AC Milan and Tottenham to draw; both teams to score</p>
