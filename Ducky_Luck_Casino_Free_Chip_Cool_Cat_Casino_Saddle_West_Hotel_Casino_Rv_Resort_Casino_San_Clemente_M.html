<p>A recent press release by online payments giant Paysafe revealed a new partnership with online bookmaker ClutchBet. The operator is a subsidiary of Australia’s BlueBet Holdings, a mobile sportsbook with a worldwide presence. The deal will strengthen Paysafe’s presence in Iowa and give ClutchBet access to an upgraded suite of digital payment solutions like Paysafecash and the Skrill USA digital wallet.</p>
<p>Clients Will Have Access to Seamless Payment Solutions</p>
<p>According to Paysafe’s press release, the deal with ClutchBet is part of a multi-state partnership that aims to promote the online payment company’s solutions in Iowa. This move will simultaneously improve the user experience for ClutchBet customers, allowing a fast, reliable deposit and withdrawal process. Zak Cutler, Paysafe’s president of global gaming, expressed delight in supporting BlueBet’s foray into the US market, emphasizing that the new payment options would be a great boon to the operator.</p>
<p>We…look forward to ensuring the brand’s customers, including VIP players, enjoy a fast and frictionless payments experience. Zak Cutler, president of global gaming at Paysafe</p>
<p>Cutler noted that both companies shared a player-centric approach and drew attention to Paysafe’s various services. These include the Skrill USA digital wallet, which allows players to make quick deposits directly from their bank accounts. High-rollers will also be able to enroll in the Skrill VIP player program. Members enjoy higher transaction limits and retain the ability to make automated instant deposits 24/7, transfer winnings directly to their linked bank accounts, or convert their funds into cryptocurrency. Betting with cash is also an option thanks to ClutchBet’s integration with Paysafecash, allowing clients to pay at select in-store retailers across the USA.</p>
<p>ClutchBet Hopes the Deal Will Ease Its Entry into the USA</p>
<p>The Paysafe partnership will also be a substantial boon to BlueBet’s efforts to establish itself in the North American market. The operator’s US-focused ClutchBet brand launched last month, just before the 2022 NFL season, allowing players to wager on several North American sports leagues and many international sports. Outside of Iowa, the operator has received regulatory approval to operate in Colorado, Indiana, and Louisiana and plans to extend the Paysafe partnership to these states.</p>
<p>Jake Francis, BlueBet USA’s SVP of operations, was hopeful that the agreement with Paysafe would benefit both companies. He used the opportunity to draw attention to the substantial quality of life improvements customers would be able to enjoy.</p>
<p>The Skrill USA electronic wallet revamp will immediately benefit a player database that has cried out for instant withdrawals and flexible limits for far too long. Jake Francis, SVP of operations at BlueBet USA</p>
<p>ClutchBet is a newcomer to the USA sports betting scene and will face difficulties carving a niche in this highly competitive industry, so partnering with a market-leading payment provider like Paysafe is a step in the right direction. BlueBet’s experience in delivering a quality mobile experience and its customizable technology platform will be paramount to its future success.</p>
