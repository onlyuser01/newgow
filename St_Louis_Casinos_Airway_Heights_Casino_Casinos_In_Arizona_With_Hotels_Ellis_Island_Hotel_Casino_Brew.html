    <h1>St Louis Casinos Airway Heights Casino Casinos In Arizona With Hotels Ellis Island Hotel Casino Brew</h1>

<p>Kambi Group has signed a new partnership in the Netherland, seeking to elevate its own status in the country and provide 711.nl, one of the fastest growing local sportsbook and gaming operators, with its own brand of spot-on sports betting products and services.</p>
<p>Among those is the Complete sportsbook solution, an established and market leading option for many companies around the world, and most recently Svenska Spel, the former Swedish monopoly. This will be supplemented by the addition of the Bet Builder tool, as well as Kambi Group’s cutting edge AI trading products.</p>
<p>Although 711 has a firm focus on the online casino vertical, the expansion of the regulated sports betting market has not gone unnoticed by the company, which has sought out to strengthen its presence in the world of sports through partnerships with Excelsior Rotterdam, FC Emmen and Telstar, all of which are part of the Dutch soccer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Welcoming the news 711 COO Gilles de Backers said that the brand has already enjoyed a strong reception with locals and added that the building of a robust sports betting product was a next step and a natural evolution of the brand’s growth.</p>
<p>"By partnering with a leading sportsbook provider like Kambi, we are excited to be in a position to provide our growing customer base with a best-in-class product and exciting sports betting experiences," de Backers added.</p>
<p>Kambi CEO and Co-founder Kristian Nylén was pleased with the opportunity to deploy his company’s signature technology with 711. He said that it was an important milestone as it marked 711’s first entry into the sports betting landscape, and Kambi was well-poised to ensure that this went smoothly, offering its established technology – the basis of the operator’s success.</p>
<p>As to Kambi’s overall ambitions for the European market, they have been overt. Kambi is determined to build across the board, bringing value as it goes along. Regulated European markets have been among the immediate focuses of the company, but the company has similarly launched its sportsbook product with Svenska Spel in Sweden.</p>
<p>Kambi was also instrumental in the delivery of sportsbook technology for BetMGM as part of the latter’s rollout in the United Kingdom, which is aligned with the operator’s international strategy that includes overseas markets.</p>
