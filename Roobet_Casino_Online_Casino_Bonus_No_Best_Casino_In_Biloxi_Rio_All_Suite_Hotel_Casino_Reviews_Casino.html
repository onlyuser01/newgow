<p>Innovative, next-evolution marketplace for sports betting that gives bettors proven tools for selling and buying active sports bets WagerWire and sports betting platform Wagr have inked a new partnership. The two companies are determined to use their synergy and focus their social-centric ethos to grow and educate a better-educated community of sports bettors.</p>
<p>Together to Offer a Differentiated Experience for Users</p>
<p>WaerWire’s chief executive officer Zach Doctor spoke about their ongoing plans to keep “building the greatest next-generation online betting experience” while developing an active and engaged sports bettor community that is smarter and more empowered.</p>
<p>The company also presented the first installment in a series of important findings from a study that ended in August. The study showcased the feelings and behaviors of sports bettors along with people who plan on becoming bettors, revealing that as many as 43% of non-bettors feel like they do not know enough about what it means to bet on sports. The results also showed that 41% of non-bettors did not know enough about online betting. The numbers highlighted the necessity for more efficient betting education in engaged bettor communities belonging to both companies that have signed the new partnership deal.</p>
<p>Doctor called Wagr an “ideal operator to partner with,” further explaining the way the two companies will manage to bring their core value propositions together and create “the ultimate bettor experience.”</p>
<p>Harnessing the Electric Energy of Sports Fans</p>
<p>Eliana Eskinazi, Wagr’s chief operating officer and co-founder described Tennessee’s sports fans’ energy as “electric.” She further explained why, as a local operator, the company was interested in harnessing this energy using online and in-person experiences. While eager to provide its players and the overall community the “best-in-class experience,” Eskinazi said Wagr was prepared to join hands with WagerWire’s “highly engaged online community” to expand its foothold in Tennessee and other parts of the US.</p>
<p>WagerWire is a company that provides seamless tracking of sports bets in real-time to show bettors the exact value of their bets. The company completed its seed investment round in July 2022 with the help of investors like Roger Ehtrebberg, founding partner of seed-stage venture firm IA Ventures and member of the Miami Marlins advisory board and ownership group, together with National Basketball Association All-Star Richard Jefferson, and 305 ventures, SimpleBet &amp; Betr’s founder Joey Levy’s venture company, to name a few.</p>
