While FanDuel has initiated the process to appoint its new CEO, King agreed to remain with the company for that time. With that in mind, Flutter did acknowledge that King’s departure may “affect the timing of any potential US listing“.</p>
<p>Leading FanDuel Was a Privilege, Says King</p>
<p>Commenting on the subject, King said that leading FanDuel for the last 4 years has been a privilege. Furthermore, he acknowledged that this was an incredibly exciting period for the company. King stressed that FanDuel is currently positioned well for its next chapter of growth. Furthermore, he added that now is the time for him to “take on new opportunities“.</p>

<p>Flutter’s CEO Peter Jackson Thanked King for the Hard Work and Dedication</p>
