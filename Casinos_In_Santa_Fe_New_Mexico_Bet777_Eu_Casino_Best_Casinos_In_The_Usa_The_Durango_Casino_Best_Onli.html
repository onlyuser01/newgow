<p>NOVOMATIC, a leading European operator and gambling tech supplier, has received player protection certifications from the Global Gambling Guidance Group (G4). The latter body certified NOVOMATIC in two of its core markets, namely Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC Certified in Spain and Italy</p>
<p>The certifications are a testament to NOVOMATIC’s ongoing commitment to responsible gambling. As a major player in the sector, the company recognizes the importance of long-term sustainability and has already earned certifications in various other markets, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC prides itself on being the first Austrian company to receive international recognition for its safer gambling policies. The G4 certification is considered to be the strictest in the field of player protection, the company pointed out, which is why NOVOMATIC is proud of its achievement. Furthermore, the majority of the company’s revenues also have G4 certification, further distinguishing the group from its competitors.</p>
<p>The G4 standards are updated every three years in accordance with the latest scientific data from all business areas in the gambling industry. Companies applying for a certificate follow certain guidelines, such as teaching employees to prevent problem gambling, protecting young people from harm, marketing gambling responsibly and providing customers with education and safer gambling tools, among other requirements.</p>

<p>Ynze Remmers, lead auditor at G4, noted that the accreditation program seeks to make the industry more responsible and urge operators to protect customers from harm. He praised NOVOMATIC for successfully passing all requirements in its core markets and prioritizing harm minimization.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Johannes Gratzl, a member of NOVOMATIC’s executive board, said that the successful certification was a great milestone for its team. He noted that this proves that his company prioritizes player and youth protection at all times and is happy to see its strategy work.</p>
<p>Ryszard Presch, another board member, added:</p>
<p>As an operator of international casinos and a globally exporting technology supplier, compliance with the strictest Responsible Gaming standards and our commitment to social responsibility are an essential part of our corporate strategy. Ryszard Presch, executive board member, NOVOMATIC</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, NOVOMATIC closed an acquisition deal with HBG Group, cementing its position as one of the biggest concessionaires in Italy. After operating gambling in the country for 15 years, the company is now a true powerhouse in the sector.</p>
