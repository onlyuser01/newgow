<p>Global provider of sports betting data and services Sportradar entered into a multi-year strategic partnership in the US with the sports betting brand Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI), TwinSpires.</p>
<p>Access to Sportradar’s Betting Services</p>
<p>The 5-year deal will allow the online sports betting brand which CDI launched in Michigan in January 2021 to utilize Sportradar’s pre-match and live betting services, as well as content solutions across a wide range of sports in the US.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be partnering with Sportradar to bring our players the most engaging sports betting products to wager on. As our business continues to grow, we are making significant steps in the number of sports, leagues and live events our players are able to access, view lines and place wagers on.” Ian Williams, President, Online Division, CDI</p>
<p>Sportradar’s products and services will further expand TwinSpire’s content offering and help the sports betting brand to offer its customers to take advantage of a number of in-play betting opportunities and other sports wagering markets.</p>
<p>“Sportradar is excited to be working with TwinSpires as it continues to expand within the US sports betting market. TwinSpires has a great opportunity ahead of itself, so we look forward to joining them on this journey and helping them deliver a high-quality betting experience that customers can rely on.” Neale Deeley, Managing Director, US Betting, Sportradar</p>
<p>Sportradar Continues with Sports Betting Partnerships</p>
<p>The deal with the sports betting arm of CDI is the latest in a series of business partnerships aimed at strengthening Sportradar’s sports betting products and services as March proved to be a busy month for the data and technology supplier.</p>
<p>In the wake of information that Sportradar is about to go public via a merger with the special purpose acquisition company Horizon Acquisition Corp. II, the data and integrity company boosted its sports betting product offering by the addition of the marketing personalization platform Fresh Eight.</p>
<p>The acquisition opened opportunities for Sportradar to offer dynamic creative optimization (DCO) personalization and allow its bookmaker partners to “fully optimize their media investments” while having full control over sports betting content integration across their platforms.</p>
<p>By the end of March, Sportradar took steps to enhance its full-service product suite after an agreement with Synergy Sports to acquire the video and data analytics business was reached.</p>
<p>With its global leadership position in the field of data and video analytics for college and professional sports, as well as expertise in automated sports technology applications, Synergy Sports presents an opportunity for Sportradar to further expand its existing partnerships with key sports organizations, among which the NBA, MLB, and the NCAA.</p>
