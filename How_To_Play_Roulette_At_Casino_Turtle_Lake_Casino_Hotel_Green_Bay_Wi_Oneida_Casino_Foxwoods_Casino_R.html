<p>SG and Oneida get go-ahead to launch joint-venture in NYS</p>
<p>NY legislators still discussing sports betting law</p>
<p>The session ends on June 19</p>
<p>Oneida Indian Nation and Scientific Games are moving forth with a sports betting venture partnership in New York State, after successfully securing a license from the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC)</p>
<p>SG and Oneida to Launch Sports Betting Joint-Venture in NY State</p>
<p>Renowned casino software developer Scientific Games and tribal gaming company Oneida Indian Nation have obtained the go-ahead from the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) to pursue sports betting operations in New York State as part of a joint-venture.</p>
<p>Following an early announcement this year, SG will be bringing the OpenBet solution to Oneida’s properties located in New York, including:</p>
<p>Turning Stone Resort</p>
<p>Yellow Brick Road</p>
<p>Point Place</p>
<p>All casinos are popular gaming destinations that will benefit from state-of-the-art player management software, dynamic pre-game and live data feeds provided by Don Best Spots, a Scientific Games-owned platform providing online betting odds.</p>
<p>Before SG and Oneida can launch their sports betting platform, they will have to await a final approval from NYS, which is still debating the roll-out of its sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Blues in New York – A Perilous Passage for A 6113</p>
<p>Legislation in New York has been moving at a good pace recently.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Gary Pretlow has been among the most vociferous supporters of online sports betting in the state. The Empire State voted in favor of the current legislation dubbed A 6113 and passed by the Committee on Racing and Wagering on Wednesday, May 29.</p>
<p>Long time coming but today I presented our Sports Betting bill to my committee for vote. It passed 8-3 and will move onto the Codes Committee for consideration. pic.twitter.com/uZjsUnf2AX — J Gary Pretlow (@JGPretlow) May 29, 2019</p>
<p>A similar push has been undertaken by a known friend of sports betting with Sen. Joseph Addabbo, recently clearing the New York Senate Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee.</p>
<p>Both Pretlow and Addabbo aren’t picking up serious fights on a legislative level, as the recent passages were mostly a formality. The real opposition comes from Democrat Carl Heastie who is also the Speaker of the Assembly, and more importantly Gov. Andrew Cuomo whose reservations about sports betting are a well-established fact. However, Cuomo has given signs that mobile betting may be coming to NYS sooner than expected.</p>
<p>The Partners Happy with the Progress</p>
<p>Oneida and SG’s joint-venture’s success still hinges on the fact whether New York legislators pass the bill. Oneida Indian Nation spokesperson, Ray Halbritter, had this to add in light of the recent approval issued by NIGC:</p>
<p>We are proud that we will be among the first Indian nations nationally to offer sports betting, and we appreciate NIGC’s review and approval of our partnership with Scientific Games.</p>
<p>Halbritter elaborated that a partnership between SG Digital and SG would give guests an unmatched sports betting experience in the still virgin New York State.</p>
<p>SG Digital CEO Jordan Levin also commented the latest developments, saying “We’re making great strides in preparing for the New York market to go live with sports betting, and we’re honoured to work with the Oneida Indian Nation to activate our proven sports betting solution.”</p>
<p>With all key players aligning themselves to break into the New York sports betting landscape, locals can expect an up-to-scratch betting solution. The NYS Gaming Commission is already in the process of drafting rules for retail sports betting, though without a clear-cut legislative framework, no further actions can be taken.</p>
<p>Legislators have until June 19 to decide on a sports betting framework which can be signed by the governor.</p>
