    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Las Vegas Twelve Tribes Casino Washington Online Casino Games That Pay Real M</h1>

<p>Dear jmsteek,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino's General T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"1.1 Creating Your Account: To use the services, You first will need to create an account with ACR. In creation of Your Account, You will be asked to provide such personal information as ACR may require to know its customers, including, but not limited to Your first and last name, address, a valid email address to which You have access, Your birth date, and a valid telephone number. You shall ensure and are obligated to provide accurate and truthful information in creating Your account and shall keep such Account information current. In the event that You have any questions about creating Your Account or updating information, please contact support@americascardroom.eu. You may only have one account with ACR and shall only use the Service using such single account. Playing poker through multiple accounts, concurrently or not, with or without the account owner’s consent, is a violation of the Terms and Conditions of Use for any person involved in such activity."</p>
<p>Please understand that the vast majority of casinos prohibit players from opening more than one account. You even admitted that the last account was blocked due to a suspicion of multiple accounts, yet you went and created another one knowing well what could happen.</p>
<p>I am afraid that we are not able to help in this case. I can only recommend that you refrain from opening more than one account in each casino.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
