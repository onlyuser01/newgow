<p>Evoplay continues to grow its content footprint with the company signing a partnership with Gaming Innovation Group (GiG). Thanks to this new partnership, GiG will have direct access to Evoplay’s impressive portfolio of titles and take it across numerous operators powered by the company.</p>
<p>Evoplay Games Now Available with GiG Player Bases</p>
<p>GiG was founded in 2012 and has been one of the most prominent choices for iGaming and interactive wagering since then. The company provides extensive solutions, services, and products in the segment, helping build an advanced offer for customers.</p>
<p>The new partnership will see 62 games from Evoplay’s portfolio join GiG’s platform and be made available to a number of partner companies. Evoplay provides 52 immersive slot experiences along with 10 entertainment instant games. This will significantly improve the number of available titles and genres that GiG’s player base can enjoy as a result.</p>
<p>Evoplay has designed some excellent games, such as Temple of Dead, Fruit Super Nova 100, Gold of Sirens, Ellen’s Fortune, Cycle of Luck and so many more. All of these games are in fact regulation-ready and good to launch in jurisdictions licensed by the MGA.</p>
<p>Evoplay is looking to significantly increase its market reach. Commenting on this latest opportunity, Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi said that this relationship with GiG would enable the company to significantly expand its footprint across Europe.</p>
<p>“It’s been an amazing journey for our team so far this year, and in many ways, we’re only just getting started,” he added. Evoplay was proud to deliver some of the best content in regulated markets, Malakchi concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Martin Collins, director of sales and business development at GIG welcomed the partnership in a similarly optimistic vibe. She said that GiG was thrilled to be adding Evoplay and praised the company’s established track record in providing excellent iGaming products.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic for our business to establish such a long-term, fruitful partnership with the development studio, and we look forward to seeing it bear fruit in the near future,” Attard concluded in her turn.</p>
