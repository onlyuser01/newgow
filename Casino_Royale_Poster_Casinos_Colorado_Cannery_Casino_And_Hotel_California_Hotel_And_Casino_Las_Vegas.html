<p>Betfred Loses £1.7 Million Software Glitch Jackpot Case</p>

<p>A gambler denied a £1.7 million ($2.3 million) payout because of a technical glitch has won a three-year legal battle for a jackpot that didn’t really exist. A London High Court judge on Wednesday ruled that Betfred Casino’s terms and conditions failed to protect the company from liability, as it had argued.</p>

<p>Andrew Green, 54, of Lincolnshire, was playing Frankie Dettori’s Magic Seven Blackjack at Betfred in 2018 when he believed he hit the seven-figure jackpot.</p>
<p>The Playtech-built game is a blackjack variation that uses a progressive-slot side-game element to award big prizes linked across the entire Playtech network.</p>
<p>Green was officially congratulated by Betfred staff. He immediately extended his overdraft and spent £2,500 celebrating. But four days later, Betfred got in touch to explain the game had suffered a software malfunction and “no legitimate jackpot win occurred.”</p>
<p>£60,000 Refused</p>
<p>Company officials said a glitch had stopped the game from resetting properly. Had Green continued to play, his money would have kept growing exponentially, they claimed.</p>
<p>Green, a single parent who has previously suffered four heart attacks, said he felt like his “insides had been ripped out” by the news.</p>
<p>He was offered a £60,000 ($82,000) settlement from Betfred with a non-disclosure agreement. But he turned it down and sued instead for £1.7 million, plus interest.</p>
<p>Usually, casino game glitches favor the operator, as a malfunction “voids all pays and plays.” Recent attempts by players to sue for phantom jackpots have not gone well for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>As such, Betfred argued that it was covered under its terms and conditions. But, while extensive, these failed to stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Mrs. Justice Foster ruled that the language of some of the clauses was “inadequate,” and “not transparent or fair and Betfred was not entitled to rely upon them.”</p>
<p>“The last three years have felt like hell on earth. I think Betfred have treated me abysmally. But it’s not about Betfred today – I’m just ecstatic to have eventually won my case. Along with my family, I have been through some very low times and become very down,” said Green.</p>
<p>“My physical health has also suffered badly, and I sometimes wished I’d never won this money because it was just making my life a misery. But today, I feel like the world has been lifted off my shoulders and I feel so incredibly happy and relieved – for me, my family, and my legal team.”</p>
<p>Betfred Backs Down</p>
<p>Betfred’s lawyers said they would appeal. But the company appeared to back down in a statement to the BBC on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Mr. Green won the jackpot three times whilst playing a game provided by one of our third-party suppliers,” said a Betfred spokesperson. “The supplier reported a software problem to us and advised that we should withhold payment.</p>
<p>“However, we will abide by the court’s decision and not appeal. We would like to apologize to Mr. Green for the delay in receiving his money.”</p>
