<p>1X2 Network, a leading iGaming supplier of popular online casino games, announced that it has been cleared for launch in the state of Michigan. According to the company, it has been formally granted a full supplier’s license by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the state’s gambling regulator.</p>
<p>The company described its entry into the Great Lakes State as a “key milestone” in its expansion in the United States and the Americas as a whole.</p>
<p>Thanks to the approval, 1X2 Network will be able to launch games from its proprietary game studios in the state. This includes content from Iron Dog Studio, Prospect Gaming and AD LUNAM, allowing local operators to enhance their product offerings.</p>
<p>As a result, players in Michigan will get to try out games such as 1 Million Megaways BC and 1 Million Fortunes Megaways. In addition, gamblers will also be able to give Iron Dog Studio’s Strike Series of Hold and Win titles a shot.</p>
<p>In 2022, 1X2 Network successfully launched its content in the Canadian province of Ontario. The content of its in-house studios resonated with Canadian gamblers, proving to be a hit among NA audiences.</p>
<p>1X2 Network is Excited to Grow in North America</p>
<p>In addition to established games, players in Michigan will also get to play AD LUNAM’s inaugural game Maverick via the 1X2 Network. The AD LUNAM brand launched Maverick in February amid growing demand for crash gaming content.</p>
<p>1X2 Network noted that Maverick is “one of its first forays” into crash and multiplier gaming.</p>
<p>1X2 Network’s chief executive officer, Kevin Reid, commented on the new deal, expressing his pride to bring the company’s content to the United States. He praised Michigan as a visionary state because it was one of the first states to “fully appreciate the powerful opportunities for regulated iGaming.”</p>
<p>Reid concluded that his team trusts in the regulation of gaming and is excited to grow its presence in North America.</p>
<p>We share Michigan’s belief in the sector’s future being in regulation, and we welcome the challenge to strengthen our position in the USA amongst such exciting competition. Kevin Reid, CEO, 1X2 Network</p>
<p>In other news, 1X2 Network recently agreed to provide Hub88 with some of its best games.</p>
