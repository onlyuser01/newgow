    <h1>Prairie Band Casino And Resort Casino In Evansville Indiana Mi Casinos Resort And Casino Near Me Coc</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have two withdrawal orders. The first one is for 200, which I'd like to have transferred to my bank account, and the second is for 70 Euros, which I initially wanted on my Mastercard. I wanted to play some more, so I cancelled the 70 Euros. Then, it was supposed to be immediately credited to my player's account. However, that didn't happen. I contacted the support team, and they said that it could take a bit longer. So, I waited - for about two hours.</p>
<p>It still wasn't there. Now, they are accusing me of having gambled away the 70 Euros. This is not true because the money was not credited to my account.</p>
<p>I would like to know what can be done about it.</p>
