<p>Valentin Moldavsky vs Linton Vassell is one of the most interesting matchups of Bellator 292, an MMA event taking place this Friday at Sap Center in San Jose, California</p>
<p>Bellator 292: Nurmagomedov vs Henderson is stacked with amazing fights. The main event, though, seems a bit mismatched as Usman Nurmagomedov is priced at -2000. This is why we’ve decided to preview another fight from the Bellator 292 main card – Valentin Moldavsky vs Linton Vassell.</p>

<p>Valentin Moldavsky Is Hungry for Wins</p>
<p>Moldavsky is 11-2-1 in his professional career, and one of those 11 wins was against his next opponent, Linton Vassell. It happened in March 2019 when we saw Moldavsky beat him by a unanimous decision.</p>
<p>The Russian fighter definitely has what it takes to be considered the betting favorite, but there’s one thing that needs to worry him. He is without a single win in almost two years. The last time Moldavsky won a fight was in June 2021 when he beat Timothy Johnson by unanimous decision and won the interim Bellator Heavyweight title.</p>
<p>He then lost to Ryan Bader by unanimous decision, thus losing the Bellator Heavyweight World Championship to the American. Next came the fight with Steve Mowry, which was supposed to serve as a sort of title eliminator, but the fight was declared no contest after just 54 seconds after Moldavsky poked his rival in the eye by accident.</p>
<p>Fedor Emelianenko’s protégé has a chance to get back to his winning ways this coming Friday when he’s taking on Linton Vassell. Can he pull it off?</p>
<p>Moldavsky is a former world champion in Combat Sambo, who’s great when it comes to striking. He also has great stamina, the evidence being that nine of his fights went to the final bell, two of which were five-rounders.</p>
<p>Linton Vassell Plotting Revenge</p>
<p>Linton Vassell is 31-8-1 overall with four straight wins, three of which happened by TKO. The last time he lost a fight was against Moldavsky in Vassell’s first heavyweight fight after almost a decade. Since then, however, he’s bulked up but he’s still fast and agile.</p>
<p>Vassell moves great inside the ring and tends to land a lot of strikes in every fight. He’s also great on the floor, the evidence being that he’s got eight wins by submission in his portfolio. The big question is whether he can do the same to Moldavsky? We don’t think so.</p>
<p>Valentin Moldavsky vs Linton Vassell Prediction</p>
<p>Linton Vassell is a great finisher, but Valentin Moldavsky has never lost a fight inside the distance. We don’t think Vassell will finish him on Friday. Instead, we think Moldavsky will win by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Valentin Moldavsky to win by decision</p>
