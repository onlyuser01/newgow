    <h1>Wetumpka Al Casino Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Las Vegas Reviews Winaday Casino Casinos In Mi</h1>

<p>On the 1st of December, I requested 5 withdrawals in large amounts. On the same day, I was asked to send an email to security@1win.xyz, which I did. Subsequently, they requested the necessary documentation for account verification. I complied, and they asked for 14 days to verify the account. Today, the 16th of December, I've yet to receive any response from the platform via email. The customer service - via calls, live chat, or Telegram - has been terrible and questionable. During live chats, they leave the conversation midway; on Telegram, they delete the delivered messages; over the phone, they hang up on you. I have sent new emails as requested during the chats, and have done everything as per their guidance. But up until now, they don't seem interested in resolving the issue. Instead, they keep asking me to wait and send a new email, creating an infinite loop because every new email resets the 14-day deadline.</p>
<p>I have screenshots of everything I've mentioned here, as well as call recordings. Today, for example, a representative stated that everything would be resolved by today, or at most, by tomorrow. Through live chat, however, they asked for a new email. Their responses are inconsistent, with everyone providing different information. I have a screenshot of the live chat conversation from yesterday, 15th December, where the operator declared that everything would be sorted out within a few hours - but still, nothing has happened.</p>
<p>I'm available at the platform's disposal to provide clarification and make an attempt to resolve this situation. I'm also available for media and press if they are interested in understanding this case in detail, considering that the platform is infringing on several articles of the federal constitution here in Brazil, one of which involves unlawful ownership of assets, as has been the case with me.</p>
