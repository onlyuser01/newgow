<p>Superbet Group has appointed a new Chief Executive Officer in the face of Jimmy Maymann who will officially step into the position on January 15, 2024, when the outgoing incumbent, Johnny Hartnett, officially leaves the company, various media outlets reported.</p>
<p>Maymann is an internal hire, and the current Deputy Chairman of Superbet, who has accumulated significant experience as part of the company. In celebrating the appointment of the new executive, Superbet Group released a statement in which the company celebrated the accomplishments of Hartnett who has steered the company on a path to profitability and business expansion over the past four and a half years.</p>
<p>Maymann comes fully prepared, bringing a wealth of experience of his own, having helped grow more than 10 companies in his time and led some promising start-ups to fruition. Maymann was also CEO at The Huffington Post and designed and oversaw its expansion strategy in 15 international markets.</p>
<p>Maymann is taking this new position confident in the future success of the company under his stewardship. "I am delighted to take on the role of CEO and offer my expertise and passion," Maymann added.</p>
<p>"Superbet has tremendous potential in terms of business scalability and expansion into international markets, all within a solid framework of trust between the Group, its customers and market stakeholders," he continued.</p>
<p>Harnett also shared his thoughts on his departure and said that he had been thankful for the opportunity to help transform Superbet Group into the behemoth it is today. He thanked all his colleagues for working hard on making the company resilient and ready for the next phase of its growth under Maymannâ€™s leadership.</p>
<p>His appointment at the helm of the company comes only six months after Maymann was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Board in May. Meanwhile, Superbet has spared no effort and has been building its offer by teaming up with a number of companies from across the iGaming and betting space, including Comtrade and Pragmatic Play.</p>
