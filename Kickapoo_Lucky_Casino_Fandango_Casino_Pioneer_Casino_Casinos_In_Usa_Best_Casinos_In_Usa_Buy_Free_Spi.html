    <h1>Kickapoo Lucky Casino Fandango Casino Pioneer Casino Casinos In Usa Best Casinos In Usa Buy Free Spi</h1>

<p>For some time now, more and more providers have come up with the idea that you can buy your free spins on certain slots. Mostly with a value of 100 times your stake, which means that if you play for 1 euro you can buy free spins for 100 euro.</p>
<p>Streamers like to use this method, and one likes to be blinded by the so-called successes of the streamers.</p>
<p>Now is the time to clarify whether it makes sense or not.</p>
<p>Clearly-NO !!!!!!!</p>
<p>It's easy to say no-let's get to the why.</p>
<p>If you buy free spins for 100 euros now you are foregoing 100 spins yourself. If you don't buy free spins now, but press the push button 100 times - or automatically go to 100 games that you don't make a profit? The chances of achieving free spins are also possible here in the 100 games. You don't have to buy any free spins. But when you buy free spins, you automatically give away 100 euros, and you take the opportunity to win with 100 spins.</p>
<p>And who now thinks the chances of cashing in big increase just because you buy free spins, you are wrong.</p>
<p>I looked at it and bought ebi pragmatiplay in the Wild West Gold slot or something like that 4 times free spins for 100 euros each. I had 1000 euros on the account.</p>
<p>Got the same picture with the 3 scatters 4 times for the purchase and 4 times I got nothing - if you win less than 10 times your stake - you get a total of 10 euros from the game</p>
<p>So remember, being able to buy free spins is 90% more beneficial to the casino than the player.</p>
<p>And before someone with a streamer win so much. Maybe - but I can't judge it that way - because I don't watch a streamer live. So I don't know what you will lose or gain beforehand.</p>
<p>And I don't give anything to the YouTube videos - I look at them, but it's more about how the games are.</p>
<p>But I have my own opinion about streamers.</p>
<p>They have completely different conditions, at least many of you.</p>
<p>And I can't take Knossi the Streamer seriously, for example. Now it's all about the streamer but not the person.</p>
<p>Knossi says yes every time - don't play, keep your hands off it! Which I think is absolutely great. But then every time like that because he gets into free spins, or makes a slightly higher profit, is questionable for me. Because in principle he is giving people to understand that it's great and what else do I know. I think he is moving on very thin ice with his action.</p>
<p>But as I said, that's not personal against Knossi, because I don't know him personally, just the way he is on the streams.</p>
