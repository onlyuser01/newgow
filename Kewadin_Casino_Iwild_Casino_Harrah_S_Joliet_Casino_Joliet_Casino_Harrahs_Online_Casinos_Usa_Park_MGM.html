<p>Former Las Vegas Raiders cornerback Damon Arnette was booked on several charges Friday evening after he allegedly drew a gun at a valet at the Park MGM, located on the Las Vegas Strip. The 5:45 pm incident stemmed from him trying to claim a car without having a ticket, TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Arnette, 25, was arrested on multiple counts. They include assault with a deadly weapon, carrying or concealing a gun without a permit, possession of marijuana or cannabis, and possession of a class one or two-level controlled substance, according to Clark County Detention Center records quoted by KLAS, a local TV station. He was held overnight at the detention center and was released Saturday after posting bail.</p>
<p>Another man connected to the incident, Markell Surrell, 20, was arrested for allegedly carrying or concealing a weapon without a permit. He, too, made bail. Both men were given court dates of March 29.</p>
<p>Released Again from Pro Contract</p>
<p>Because of the incident, Arnette was released from his reserve/futures contract by the Kansas City Chiefs, CBS News reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>It is not the first time he was let go by a pro team. In November, Arnette was cut by the Las Vegas Raiders. That was prompted by him being seen in a TikTok video allegedly threatening someone while brandishing three firearms.</p>
<p>Aria Valet Worker Claims Attack</p>
<p>In a still earlier incident, a valet worker at the Aria Resort &amp; Casino sued Arnette in June. Arnette allegedly attacked Sonny Flores the prior month. Flores claimed he suffered mental stress, anguish, pain, and suffering from the attack, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Arnette allegedly spit at Flores, poked him in the chest, and was verbally abusive.</p>
<p>The incident began when Arnette tried to retrieve a car without a ticket. He was allegedly intoxicated at the time. The suit also includes ten unnamed people in Arnette’s entourage who allegedly joined in the abuse.</p>
<p>Arnette denied the lawsuit’s allegations. But in December Flores filed a motion to drop the case.</p>
<p>In 2020, Arnette was involved in still another controversy. It stemmed from a car accident in Henderson, Nev. He allegedly fled the scene. He is being sued by the woman in the other car, Yaneth Coromoto Casique, who suffered injuries, TMZ said.</p>
<p>She suffered injuries to her head, shoulder, neck, and back, the Review-Journal said. Arnette was cited for failure to stop at the scene of a crash and improper lane change, Municipal Court records quoted by the Review-Journal said. Arnette reportedly pleaded guilty and paid a $1,140 fine.</p>
