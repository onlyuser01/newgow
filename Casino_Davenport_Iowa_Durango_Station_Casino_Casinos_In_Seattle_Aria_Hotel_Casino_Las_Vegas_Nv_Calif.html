<p>Aztec Gems review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This Aztec-themed slot is jam packed full of jewels.</p>
<p>Set against a dark and eerie jungle, the golden reels seem to glow. Each symbol is a different vividly hued gem. Players will feel like explorers facing a mythical trial every spin. They’ll want to walk away with every treasure.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is haunting, as if players have found themselves in a magical location. The atmosphere brings to mind classic adventure films such as Indiana Jones or Romancing the Stone.</p>
<p>The rendering of Aztec symbols definitely has a cinematic quality rather than an archeological one. However, players will find themselves entranced by this South American world created by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Win in the Aztec Gems slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack sets an epic tone with drumbeats and birdcalls. Players may enjoy the increasing tension the music adds.</p>
<p>The animation of the gems is captivating with bright colours and sparkly depth. They look like tempting candies on their reels and have a pleasing variety.</p>
<p>The golden frames that set off each symbol are adorned with Aztec engravings. This adds a lot of the thematic aesthetic.</p>
<p>The glimpse of jungle that can be seen behind the reels is dark with leaves gently swaying in the breeze. Softly glowing in the air suggests fireflies, or magic. Because the reel is front and centre, though, players will have to stay curious about the true nature of their exotic setting.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Aztec Gems is a three reel, three row slot, with five win lines.</p>
<p>This game also has a fourth reel, in which one item is randomly selected each spin. The item chosen serves as the win Multiplier for that spin, and applies to any win lines that the player lands.</p>
