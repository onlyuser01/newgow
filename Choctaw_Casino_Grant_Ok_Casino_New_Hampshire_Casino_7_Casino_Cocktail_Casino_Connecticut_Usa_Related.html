<p>Seeking to expand gambling in New York, the state confirmed plans for three downstate casinos earlier this year. The competition is fierce, given that only three licenses are planned but two of them are likely to be secured by existing racinos. This means that it is quite likely major gambling industry players to compete for the single license remaining.</p>
<p>Now, a recent report released by the New York Post reveals that Related Companies revised its plans for a new massive casino mega-complex at Hudson Yards in New York. The project has a price tag of $10 billion, according to Related’s CEO, Jeff Blau. It is expected to feature a luxury hotel with 1,700 rooms within a “resort” tower. This would complement the nearby Javits Center and is expected to help attract more visitors.</p>
<p>More importantly, the project is expected to offer casino gambling with the globally-recognized Wynn named as the operator. The proposed skyscraper project is expected to offer up to 250,000 square feet of gaming floor that will house craps, poker, roulette, as well as blackjack games. Additional amenities the project will include would be retail outlets, as well as fine dining options.</p>
<p>In addition, Related pitched a plan for a 2 million-square-foot office tower that would use a part of the 6.5-acre Hudson Yards located between 11th and 12th Aves. in New York. Still, according to Blau, the “centerpiece” of the billion-dollar project would be the Wynn-branded tower, offering supreme entertainment and hospitality options.</p>
<p>“It will be one of the most incredible tall buildings in New York City.“ Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies</p>
<p>The Company Faces Competition</p>
<p>Although Related undoubtedly has an ambitious plan for a downstate casino, competition is certainly not backing out. Only recently, Toom Reeg, Caesars Entertainment’s CEO, spoke about the company’s New York bid for a Times Square casino.</p>
<p>In an interview for News 12, Reeg discussed for the first time publicly the company’s plans for the Caesars Palace Times Square venue. He revealed that the project would include a 52-story skyscraper and will offer a gaming area of 250,000 square feet. Additionally, Caesars Palace Times Square would offer 950 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>But it’s not only Caesars that aims to secure a license in New York. Las Vegas Sands, another major industry player, said last week that it secured a 99-year lease approval from Nassau County. This marked an important step in the company’s plan for a $5 billion-dollar casino project near the Nassau Coliseum located in Uniondale.</p>
