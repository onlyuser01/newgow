<p>According to CEO Ruf, Aberdeen is the perfect location for MERKUR’s first casino in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>MERKUR Casino has opened its first property in the United Kingdom, marking an important milestone for the company. The new casino is located in the Scottish city of Aberdeen and will provide a lot of entertainment to local players.</p>
<p>The casino was officially opened by Irina Ruf, MERKUR Casino’s chief executive officer. She was accompanied at the event by MERKUR UK general manager Sascha Blodau and the COO of MERKUR Casino UK, Mark Schertle.</p>
<p>In addition to the high-profile MERKUR representatives, the grand opening was attended by local businesspeople, dignitaries and gambling industry workers. The opening also welcomed the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, a Celtic rock band from Scotland. The world-class singer Chris Ashton also attended the opening of the MERKUR Casino Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Casino guests can expect to find a variety of gaming tables and machines. The MERKUR Casino Aberdeen boasts four tables for roulette, two tables for blackjack, a table for three card poker and two electronic roulettes. In addition, the venue has a terminal that comprises 20 of the latest B1 Jackpot Machines from leading suppliers in a single machine.</p>
<p>Aberdeen Is a Perfect Location for MERKUR Casino’s Foray into the UK</p>
<p>Irina Ruf commented on the opening, saying that the opening of MERKUR’s first casino in the United Kingdom marks a new chapter for the company. She noted that MERKUR is known for its dedication to excellence. The company already provides bingo and slots to companies on the UK’s high streets. However, MERKUR will now be able to take things a step further and offer its best-in-class casino experiences to local players.</p>
<p>Ruf said that purchasing a license in Aberdeen was a no-brainer for her team and that the move represents a “natural progression” for the company.</p>
<p>When the opportunity arose to purchase a license in Aberdeen it was a natural progression to move into the sector and launch our first UK casino. Irina Ruf, CEO, MERKUR Casino</p>
<p>According to CEO Ruf, Aberdeen is the perfect location for MERKUR’s first casino in the United Kingdom. She described the city as one with a thriving night-time economy and a Purple Flag status that attests to the safety and vibrancy of its streets at night.</p>
<p>We hope to add to that vibrancy with best-in-breed gaming entertainment and promote the safety and well-being of visitors and residents alike. Irina Ruf, CEO, MERKUR Casino</p>
<p>Last year, Merkur eSolutions, a B2B division of the Gauselmann Group, opened a new office in Malta.</p>
