    <h1>Casino Castle Login Who Owns Hard Rock Casino Betsson Casino Grosvenor Casino Casino Near By RocketP</h1>

<p>100% CERTAIN LIVE ROULETTE SOFTWARE AT ROCKETPLAY WAS 'RIGGED.'</p>
<p>Is it still after I raised the alarm bells HERE and at ROCKETPLAY? ...Don't know.</p>
<p>My bets:</p>
<p>Two from 3 columns of The Roulette table was selected with $400 bet placed for each.</p>
<p>$800 total bet for this game was the biggest bet yet by far since I started.</p>
<p>Expect net return on total game win is $400 (3:1). Sadly it was not paid...</p>
<p>The RIGGED GAME: On a WIN, $800 TOTAL BET was returned but WITHOUT the $400 PROFIT?!</p>
<p>My bets for the game and its replay was deleted from GAME HISTORY.</p>
<p>It was as if NO bets were made by me for that game.</p>
<p>However it can clearly be observed that since I started playing (and many games after this game) I wagered in EVERY SINGLE GAME.</p>
<p>The first time this happened, I thought it was a glitch and checked the game history.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the replay of my bets and the game.</p>
<p>I then relayed all this to LIVE CHAT.</p>
<p>They took quite a while to check out my concerns.</p>
<p>Eventually they came back to me and conveyed they did not know what game I was refering to.</p>
<p>There was NO RECORD of a game where I placed 2X$400bet on 2 columns with a win on number 9.</p>
<p>They even told me to go check it for myself in GAME HISTORY?!</p>
<p>Forgetting that I had already told them that I was just there and replayed my bets and the game.</p>
<p>Put simply they play dumb stone walled me AFTER my spin replay bets in the game had been DELETED!</p>
<p>Either an ALGORYTHM is in place by The Software Provider to execute such bets automatically in such a situation OR staff are micro managing players whose were applying a winning strategy seems to be unsurmountable?</p>
<p>This would imply that Software Providers and casinos collude to rig games with these algorythmic countermeasures in the programming in the advent that a player is TOO LUCKY... This is in addition to odds ALREADY being in favour of the house.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then collusion may also involve regulators and inspectors such as ECOGRA and CURALCO...</p>
<p>Cos if they did their role diligently and competently without conflictof interesdt, this rigging shouldnt be happening. Software such as GAME HISTORY shouldnt be able to be doctored by casinos!</p>
<p>to be continued...</p>
