<p>Fortune may favor the brave, but sometimes fortune makes absolutely no sense. The story of a US veteran who won $2 million, though, is well worth celebrating</p>
<p>Raymond Roberts Sr. managed to win the sizable prize across six tickets with the exact same numbers and for the same lottery draw.</p>
<p>The lucky man fetched a total of more than $2 million in the “Lucky for Life” multi-state lottery game which offers winners 20-year payments for their winnings. The game has been particularly popular around the United States, but it’s Roberts Sr. who claimed the massive reward this time.</p>
<p>The “Lucky Number” format is popular because of its low-cost entry and straightforward gameplay. Essentially, a participant pays $2 per ticket and then picks six numbers between 1 and 48, along with a lucky ball number from 1 to 18. This means that the winner managed to flip a $12 investment into a $2 million payday. Roberts Jr. got the five numbers right, but he missed the lucky ball.</p>
<p>Good Fortune Foretold and Massive Payday</p>
<p>The Massachusetts resident shared that he had a good feeling about the numbers and decided to replicate them across several tickets. All of the numbers held some significance to him, helping guide his picks.</p>
<p>The man bought the tickets from a liquor store in Fall River, which means that the retailer will also get a tidy $5,000 bonus for selling the winning ones. Roberts Jr. has decided to receive lump payments for his first five tickets or around $390,000 for each after tax. He has thus been paid $1.95 million. The sixth ticket, the winner decided to keep it as an annuity. It will be paid out in installments of $25,000 before tax over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>But while the man’s win may seem almost too good to be true, there are a few things about the nature of the victory. For one, Robert Jr. has been using the exact same numbers for more than two decades.</p>
<p>The winner has already made up his mind on what he is going to spend his winnings with the first purchase coming his way being a new motorbike.</p>
