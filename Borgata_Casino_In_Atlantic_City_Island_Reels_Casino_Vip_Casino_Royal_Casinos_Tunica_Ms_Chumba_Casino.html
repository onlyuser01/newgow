    <h1>Borgata Casino In Atlantic City Island Reels Casino Vip Casino Royal Casinos Tunica Ms Chumba Casino</h1>

<p>Hello i 'm french , and my english is not really good so i prefer to use google traductor to explain my story with this scammers .</p>
<p>Hello, I want to post these thieves so that others don't get fooled too, this is the first time it's happened to me and generally I'm careful not to go anywhere, but not on this one unfortunately . So to sum up, I go to the "purple casino" site where I deposit 100 euros with an attractive 200% welcome bonus offer. Already 1st surprise, after having deposited I do not have the 200 euros in +. I said to myself that maybe I had forgotten to tick the box, but it seemed very curious to me since I was sure I had done it, in short I wanted to go ask for it in the live chat, but the 2nd surprise , they do not have any ! Very curious again, and at this moment, I feel the sleeve arrived at 1000 km. I send an email or I have no response in 2 days. I decide to play the 100 eu, I go up to 200 eu and decide to cashout. 5 days later, a brief message to tell me that it is canceled and that it is necessary to cashout 250 euros minimum lol. Ok, I play and manage to reach this amount, I cash out so 250 eu, but it's been 13 days that it's been pending, nothing happens, I've sent messages by email, no one answers such point that I wonder if this email address exists. So AVOID THIS SCAMMER SITE, unless you love giving your money to thieves. They never deserve 5.1/10 , 0/10 is the real number Peace.</p>
