<p>The Saudi Arabian Football Federation has struck a milestone partnership with Sportradar Integrity Services, becoming the latest sports organization to support the company’s efforts in ensuring global integrity in soccer and beyond. Together, the two organizations have launched a dedicated integrity mobile SAFF branded app which will help educate consumers and athletes about the dangers of match-fixing and manipulation.</p>
<p>SAFF Launches Dedicated Integrity and Reporting App</p>
<p>The app is also used as a way to flag such offenses by the public and officials who may alert authorities to any integrity concerns they have. SAFF assures that the signals will be reviewed privately and those who signal will be able to submit their alerts safely. Presently, the app is already free to download from the Google Play and App Store, and is available in both English and Arabic.</p>
<p>SAFF general secretary Ibrahim Alkassim welcomed this partnership and said that safeguarding the integrity of the sport was a key priority for the organization. Alkassim said:</p>
<p>“Safeguarding the integrity of Saudi Arabian football is one of the biggest priorities at SAFF and, in looking to achieve this, we are delighted to be working with Sportradar Integrity Services who are the clear leaders in the particular field of sports integrity.” SAFF general secretary Ibrahim Alkassim</p>
<p>Alkassim added that the partnership between the federation and Sportradar’s Universal Fraud Detection System put the organization in a position where it can ensure that integrity is upheld and where education and prevention can be focused on as key tenets of the experience.</p>
<p>The executive assured that stakeholders will be properly educated and informed on the risks of match-fixing, and hopefully help reduce the number of such instances. SAFF is also hosting webinars that will focus on these educational activities with teams, players, and officials, as well as the federation’s own staff involved in those seminars.</p>
<p>Education and Prevent Just as Important for Fighting the Issue</p>
<p>The SAFF Integrity Unit has already been acting strongly against potential match manipulation in the sport. The federation has spared no effort in hiring the right specialists to ensure that sport is kept clean from nefarious machinations. Signals submitted through the SAFF app will be reviewed by the Integrity Unit which is equipped with the expertise and knowledge to address each signal rapidly and reliably.</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by the managing director for Sportradar Integrity Services, Andreas Krannich, who said that the company was happy to be teaming up with SAFF in ensuring that integrity-related issues are tackled. Krannich confirmed that he was looking forward to working with SAFF in the next years and deploying Sportradar’s integrity program.</p>
