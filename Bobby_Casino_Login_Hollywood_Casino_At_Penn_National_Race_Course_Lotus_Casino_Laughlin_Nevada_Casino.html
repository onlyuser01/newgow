<p>A subsidiary of the Gauselmann Group, Merkur eSolutions, recently opened a new office in Malta, the German-based gambling group announced in a press release.</p>
<p>Celebrating New Home in Malta</p>
<p>Merkur eSolutions Malta opened its new office in the Plaza Business Center in Sliema on October 5, inviting representatives of the Malta Gaming Authority, service providers, industry stakeholders, and other various interest groups, including the iGaming Academy, Finductive, to join the company’s employees and Gauselmann Group executives at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>During his speech at the ceremony, Thomas Bone, chief executive officer of Merkur Online Divisions commented on the roots of the Gauselmann Group, the future direction of the group’s business and the future of the online business-to-business (B2B) market, emphasizing the group’s intention to continue to invest in Malta.</p>
<p>Bone outlined that, by establishing Merkur eSolutions, the group “created the bridge between the stationary and online gaming worlds” and strengthened its offering with a first-class omnichannel proposition, stressing that “integrated offers are the future.”</p>
<p>“Our new office in Malta creates the perfect framework to successfully expand this strategy further,” Bone added before expressing his special thanks to the managing director of Merkur eSolutions Malta, Jeremy Camilleri, for the leading role he has played during the preparation phase for opening the new office and for maintaining the group’s high standards.</p>
<p>Spread across 650 square meters, the new office is designed in compliance with the latest health and safety standards. It will become home for other Gauselmann Group subsidiaries and associated companies, including Bede Gaming Malta, Solis Ortus Service, Cashpoint Solutions Malta, Edict Malta, BLC Systems, and Solar Operations, creating a united atmosphere for the employees under the umbrella of Merkur eSolutions Malta.</p>
<p>The Merkur eSolutions brand unites all B2B propositions of Merkur Online Divisions, offering their business partners the popular Merkur online games, technology platform, state-of-the-art eWallet payment solutions, as well as innovative devices for the stationary market under one bundle.</p>
<p>UK Investment Plan Underway</p>
<p>The opening of the office in Malta took place independently of the developments of the group’s land-based division, Merkur Slots, in the UK, where it has opened 13 new low-stake gaming centers as part of the group’s nationwide £10 million ($11.3 million) investment plan.</p>
<p>Merkur Slots opened new gaming venues worth around £200,000 ($226,000) each in Sunderland, Stockton-on-Tees, Streatham, Dover, Brierly Hill, Bradford, Aberdeen, Blackpool, Crawley, Kidderminster, Rayners Lane, Taunton, as well as the latest opening which took place less than a week ago in Spalding, Lincolnshire.</p>
