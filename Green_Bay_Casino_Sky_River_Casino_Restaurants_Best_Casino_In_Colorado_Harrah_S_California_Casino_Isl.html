    <h1>Green Bay Casino Sky River Casino Restaurants Best Casino In Colorado Harrah S California Casino Isl</h1>

<p>Can you provide documentation? Looking at my records it shows that was all processed simultaneously. And only one was redeemed. I'm starting to think you provide the codes to new gamblers so they will use them and then you can deny their winnings. Hypothetically if I redeemed a free spin bonus and won or loss not sure yet if that matters. The next day I open my email to find another free spin code to use . Being a new player I assume it was sent intentionally to me. The code came directly from the casino not found on some other site. It wasn't something I went looking for. It was delivered to me from the casino. Why would any individual not think that it would be a good thing to use. The cashier accepts it and nothing is mentioned untilyo the funds are attempted to be withdrawn. Not at any other phase. A person would think that every person who was aware of the attempted withdrawal and definitely the one handling the deposit would know your rules and advise the player. Nobody ever reads the terms and conditions and if you want to fall back onto them why doesn't your employees or computer system follow the terms and conditions? Instead you entice the players to forfeit their winnings. If I am wrong please explain why your system is set up this way and why your employees aren't following your own guidelines?</p>
