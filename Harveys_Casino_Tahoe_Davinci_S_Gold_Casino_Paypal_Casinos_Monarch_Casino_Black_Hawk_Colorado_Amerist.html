    <h1>Harveys Casino Tahoe Davinci S Gold Casino Paypal Casinos Monarch Casino Black Hawk Colorado Amerist</h1>

<p>Hello, Anja and Krist√≠na!</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have to inform Anja that she broke the rules of casino. That`s why we have to reset to zero you balance.</p>
<p>According to conditions of Slottica Casino:</p>
<p>29.5. Persistent misuse of bonuses</p>
<p>The bonus is considered to be a kind of present and encouragement to the players and does not imply any commercial gain or profit by safe wagering of bonus.</p>
<p>As a part of providing protection against all kinds of fraudulent schemes Slottica reserves the right to check the payment and gaming activity of customers at any time. And in case of identifying persistent misuse of bonuses Slottica has the right to take measures providing for either disabling the possibility of receiving bonuses in the future, or obtaining compensation for losses incurred.</p>
<p>In order to avoid questionable interpretation of the rules, we give several examples of a dishonest games. The full list of abuse is not limited by the descriptions provided below.</p>
<p>Example 1: The gamer makes many bets with the minimum expected win in order to get more bets and to wager the bonus as soon as possible. For example, making bets on all numbers in roulette, or on black / red and any other identical bets. This can be considered as persistent misuse of the bonus and lead to additional verification and possible block of an account.</p>
<p>Example 2: The gamer makes high bets to get money on his / her balance quickly and then decreases bets radically (in 2 or more times) in order to wager the bonus with less risks with an increased balance. Such situations will also be subject to verification and may lead to the account closure.</p>
<p>Each rate going to bonus wagering should not exceed 20% of the bonus amount. If the rate is 20% or more, such a rate will not count, and the status of the bonus wagering will be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Any combination which has any of the elements of the examples mentioned above, and leads to a potential persistent misuse of the bonus policy may be an occasion for additional verification.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that a confirmed phone number is obligatory for confirming the identity and is a guarantee for receiving the bonuses; in the case if these conditions are not fulfilled, the client may be suspended from the bonus policy of the Site.</p>
<p>Slottica reserves the right to change the Terms of its bonus policy any time. The client takes responsibility to keep abreast of the most relevant information regarding this issue.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to postpone any game rounds, including free spins or bonus games. In case of the discovery of deferred rounds, the casino reserves the right to block the player's account and confiscate all funds.</p>
<p>and you broke that rule that we can see right here: http://prntscr.com/rbeooh</p>
<p>Please, check the rules before playing!</p>
<p>I hope that you wont meet that situation again and will enjoy time in Slottica in future!</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Slottica Casino</p>
