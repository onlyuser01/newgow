    <h1>Grand Eagle Casino Hotels Near Mountaineer Casino Caesars Casino Atlantic City Admiral Casino Biz Ca</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>after playing for some time at this casino (BLACKJACK LIVE), at the provider betconstruct, my bets are no longer accepted on the lowest value tables.</p>
<p>I asked the casino and they replied that it had been blocked on those tables because it had opened more than one window. As I was sure this was a lie, I asked for proof ... They never gave it to me!</p>
<p>After insisting for some time, they already claimed that I had been blocked by the risk department because I placed several bets on the same table, that is, I didn't just play in a box !!!</p>
<p>The casino allows us to play in several boxes at the same time, at the same table ... But the risk department thought it couldn't. Everyone plays in more than one box, and I've never seen anyone blocked by something the casino says in its rules can be done.</p>
<p>In other words, in the rules we can play in more than one box, but if the risk department thinks we can't, this rule is no longer a rule!</p>
<p>Are we playing?</p>
<p>I only see one thing, because I'm winning they blocked me ... I always played this provider in several boxes at the same time at the same table, I was never blocked ... the difference is that this time I was winning and the others I was losing .</p>
<p>In addition, I was ready for 24 hours asking them to verify my account in order to make a withdrawal, they had the documents accepted for hours and hours ... they never let me make withdrawals, when I lose everything, after 1min, they approve my account.</p>
<p>more than suspect is a lack of respect !!!!!!!</p>
<p>Score zero at this casino ... prosecutors of who is winning.</p>
