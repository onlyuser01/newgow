    <h1>Doubledown Casino Code Share Betsson Casino Pala Casino Concerts 2023 Ip Casino Biloxi Ms Punt Casin</h1>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We are sorry for such an unpleasant situation. However, we are here to clarify things out for you as well.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to emphasize that you contacted our support with the problem that your funds were written off from your bonus balance in the amount of 370 EUR. You were explained in the chat that the situation happened for the reason that you canceled the bonus yourself. If the bonus is canceled, your bonus funds will also be written off.</p>
<p>Secondly, you never mentioned in the chat that you had technical problems on the site. In case of any complaints about the technical work, our support responds quickly and professionally. If you complain to us personally regarding the technical issues, your problem is considered in detail and looking for a solution. However, we see that you did not provide any visual evidence, neither to us personally nor in your complaint. Also, you never mentioned the technical aspect in the chat to our support. From our side, we rely on the information in the system, where it is clearly checked that the bonus was canceled by you.</p>
<p>We are sorry that you lost your winnings, but remember that you may choose whether to use the bonuses on our site or not. And in case you activate the bonus, you must fulfill certain conditions that are mentioned on our site. That is why the support manager said that unfortunately the funds cannot be refunded in your case.</p>
<p>I understand how frustrating this must have been for you. But you also need to understand that there are certain rules that players must follow.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Savarona casino team</p>
