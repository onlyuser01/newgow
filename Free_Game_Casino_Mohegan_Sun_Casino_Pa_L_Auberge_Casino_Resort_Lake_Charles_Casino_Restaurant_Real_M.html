<p>EPIC Risk Management Pro Sport Advisory Board (PSAB) has grown its expertise with the addition of three new members who will now be able to offer further insight into gambling-related harm in their respective sport.</p>
<p>As such, the PSAB now welcomes the arrival of Chicago Fire FC Head of Player Care and Well-being RachaelJankowsky, NextPlayU Co-founder and Chief Learning Officer Dr Meg Popovic, and Professional Game Match Officials Limited Managing Director Mike Riley.</p>
<p>The new additions join what is a ten-people-strong PSAB this year tasked with helping further advance understanding of gambling-related harm in sport and how it can be prevented and treated.</p>
<p>"The approach that EPIC has taken around problem gambling in the sports world is unprecedented in its relevance, thoroughness, and professional character," said Jankowsky welcoming her appointment. She hailed EPIC’s dedication to driving results through an evidence-based approach and extensive research into the issue.</p>
<p>Jankowsky was also pleased that EPIC put emphasis on lived experiences as one of the best ways to further education and raise awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>She noted that gambling has become more prevalent in the United States and that demanded organizations take the matter seriously and train their athletes, helping them become aware of the dangers gambling may pose to their well-being and the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>Jankowsky was confident that she would be able to help EPIC have a greater impact on the lives of pro athletes through the collaborative work of the PSAB. The appointment was also welcomed by Dr Popovic who was similarly pleased to take on this new responsibility as part of EPIC’s strong team.</p>
<p>"I have huge respect for the individuals involved, as their personal character, lived experiences, and professional track records demonstrate capability and care for people and organizations," Dr Popovic noted.</p>
<p>The news was similarly hailed by Riley who said that integrity is the highest standard any sport could aspire to. He was pleased with the opportunity to support EPIC’s seminal work as part of the Pro Sports Advisory Board.</p>
<p>"EPIC’s mission to promote safer gambling, to provide education and training and to work with key stakeholders to lead effective governance are key pillars in safeguarding the integrity in elite sport," Riley further added.</p>
<p>Not least, EPIC Risk Management Director of Sports Partnerships Ben McGregor was similarly pleased to see the three new members join. McGregor argued that the organization was grateful to them for agreeing to impart their expertise and knowledge to the Board and help the organization continue on its mission to safeguard professional sports – and esports – athletes from the dangers of gambling and gambling-related harm.</p>
