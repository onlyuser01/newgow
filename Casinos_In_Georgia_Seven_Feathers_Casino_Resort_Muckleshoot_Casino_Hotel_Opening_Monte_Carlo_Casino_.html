    <h1>Casinos In Georgia Seven Feathers Casino Resort Muckleshoot Casino Hotel Opening Monte Carlo Casino</h1>

<p>BetMGM continues to expand its lineup of prominent sports figures as brand ambassadors. The latest addition of talent features Chris Johnson, a former Arizona Cardinals and Tennessee Titans running back.</p>
<p>A known face in the NFL and sports, Johnson joins a number of other ambassadors whom BetMGM has brought on board to promote its name and boost awareness for its products.</p>
<p>As a result, BetMGM will launch a number of social media initiatives, marketing campaigns, and promotions featuring Johnson’s likeness, as well as host fan events. Commenting on the opportunity to be joining the team, Johnson had this to add:</p>
<p>“I’m excited to join the BetMGM team and to have a new platform to engage with CJ2K fans around the country. BetMGM is at the forefront of the excitement surrounding sports betting and is a perfect fit for me to get involved in this rapidly growing industry.” BetMGM ambassador Chris Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson’s Legacy Is a Testimony to BetMGM</p>
<p>Johnson has been one of the most prominent players in the ten seasons he participated in. He has been dubbed “CJ2K” because he rushed 2,006 yards for the Titans, a landmark achievement in the sport, and he is one of the eight players in the National Football League to have ever achieved this distinction in the history of the sport.</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost welcomed Johnson on board and thanked him for having him with the company. Fans, Prevost argued, were aware of Johnson and his status in pro football.</p>
<p>The executive was happy to see BetMGM strengthen its ties with Arizona and Tennessee fan bases and sports bettors and argued that Johnson would play a pivotal role in that further engagement and expansion in the states and the NFL.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been appointing as many new ambassadors as new markets it has entered in more or less. The sports betting operator added NBA legend Kevin Garnett back in October to represent the brand with basketball fans. In September, the company added MMA journalist Ariel Helwani as part of its lineup to continue and build close ties in the various realms of the athletic experience.</p>
