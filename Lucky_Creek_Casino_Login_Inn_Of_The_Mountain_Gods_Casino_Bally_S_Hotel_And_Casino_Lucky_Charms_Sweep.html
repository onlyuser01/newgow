<p>RubyPlay continues to expand its global presence by launching its in-demand content in new regulated iGaming markets</p>
<p>RubyPlay, a gaming studio that seeks to create the most entertaining and innovative slot games possible, has acquired a new license. The developer reported that it has successfully secured approval from the Oficiul National pentru Jocuri de Noroc (ONJN) to launch its content in Romania.</p>
<p>As a result, the slots innovator will be able to roll out its content in the Eastern European country, powering local operators with its exciting products. The move is in line with the company’s overall expansion strategy that has seen it make forays into a variety of regulated markets all over the world.</p>
<p>According to RubyPlay, the launch in Romania will provide the supplier with significant opportunities to maintain its growth trajectory. The company’s portfolio will now be available to local players, further boosting RubyPlay’s brand awareness, while allowing Romanian customers to enjoy hit gambling titles such as Diamond Explosion 7s, Royal Griffin and Shake Shake Money Tree.</p>
<p>RubyPlay’s Content Is “Highly Relevant”</p>
<p>RubyPlay’s chief executive officer, Trevor Ginsberg, commented on the newly-secured license. He said that his team is very pleased with the development and is excited to launch RubyPlay’s titles in Romania. Ginsberg added that he cannot wait to welcome new players and introduce them to world-class gaming experiences.</p>
<p>We firmly believe our games are a strong fit for the market, particularly as the top performing games in Romania feature jackpots and hold and respin mechanics, both of which are incorporated within many of our own titles. Trevor Ginsberg, CEO, RubyPlay</p>
<p>Dr Eyal Loz, RubyPlay’s chief product officer, also commented on the matter, saying that the Romanian license is “another important milestone for the company.” RubyPlay is certain in the strength of its products and will now look to sign agreements with operators in the region.</p>
<p>We know our content is highly relevant to operators and players in the region, and I’m sure we will achieve strong brand recognition in the coming months. Dr Eyal Loz, CPO, RubyPlay</p>
<p>RubyPlay is currently undergoing a period of intensive commercial growth. The announcement about the Romanian launch follows several major deals the company signed with influential gambling companies.</p>
<p>Around a week ago, for example, RubyPlay minted a partnership agreement with LeoVegas, agreeing to supply the operator with slot games. In early March, on the other hand, the supplier penned an agreement with PokerStars, further growing its presence in the iGaming vertical. Earlier this year, the company developed bespoke content for Holland Casino Online.</p>
