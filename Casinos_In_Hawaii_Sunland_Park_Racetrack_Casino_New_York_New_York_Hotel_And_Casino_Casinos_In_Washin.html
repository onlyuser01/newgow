<p>The winner of the previous three editions of Wimbledon – Novak Djokovic – is just two wins away from defending his title. The Serbian superstar has reached the semifinal of the 2022 Gentlemen’s Singles, where he’s going to face off with the highest-ranked British player Cameron Norrie.</p>
<p>Knowing that Djokovic is one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, it’s no surprise that bookmakers see him as a strong favorite to win on Friday. However, his form hasn’t been great since he came to England, dropping four sets so far. That said, the big question here is whether Norrie can snatch a set or two (or even three!) from the GOAT candidate?</p>

<p>Djokovic Needs to Up His Form</p>
<p>Even though he remains the #1 favorite to win the 2022 Wimbledon, Djokovic hasn’t been very impressive thus far. In Round 1, he dropped one set against Soonwoo Kwon, who was a +3300 underdog before the start of the match.</p>
<p>Djokovic did well in the following two matches, beating Thanasi Kokkinakis and Miomir Kecmanovic, both in straight sets. Next came the duel with Tim Van Rijthoven, in which Djokovic dropped another set.</p>
<p>However, his toughest challenge so far happened in the 2022 Wimbledon quarterfinal against Jannik Sinner. The young Italian got himself an early lead, getting to 2-0 in sets after one hour and 35 minutes of play. Djokovic then asked for a pause to compose himself, which proved to be the right thing to do – he went on to win the next three sets, losing just seven games along the way.</p>
<p>He did make an impressive comeback on Tuesday, but the fact that he went down 2-0 against a player who is 15 years his junior has raised some eyebrows. Tennis fans are now wondering whether Novack actually has what it takes to defend his title.</p>
<p>All-England Club Crowd to Cheer Norrie On</p>
<p>The year 2016 was when a British player last played in the final of Wimbledon. Six years later, Cameron Norrie has a chance to end the wait. It’s needless to say that the crowd at All-England Club will be rooting for him, but the question is whether that will be enough to slay such a tennis giant as Djokovic.</p>
<p>Well, Norrie will certainly try. So far at the 2022 Wimbledon, the 26-year-old Brit has been pretty good, winning three of his matches in straight sets. The trouble is that he still hasn’t faced such a high-ranked player as Djokovic.</p>
<p>In fact, Norrie’s opponents thus far were Pablo Andujar-Alba (ATP 100), Jaume Munar (ATP 71), Steve Johnson (ATP 32), Tommy Paul (ATP 32), and David Goffin (ATP 58).</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic vs Cameron Norrie Prediction</p>
<p>Djokovic might not be in the best form of his life at the moment, but he sure has the skillset needed to defeat Norrie. The British player will have his fans to cheer him on, but that probably isn’t going to help him much. Instead, we should see an easy win for the Serbian.</p>
<p>Pick: Novak Djokovic to win 3-0</p>
