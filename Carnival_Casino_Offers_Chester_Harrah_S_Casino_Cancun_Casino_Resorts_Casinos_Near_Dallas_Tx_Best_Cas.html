<p>New Hampshire Strikes Big with Mobile Betting</p>
<p>New Hampshire is reaping the benefits of a fresh online sports betting industry. Just a week has passed, but as of January 6, the 16,200 registered players generated a total of $3.4 million in stakes in the seven-day period since the industry’s official launch.</p>
<p>This constitutes a small victory for New Hampshire, which managed to secure a mobile betting shortly before the New Year’s and is now reaping the benefits thereof. NH Governor Chris Sununu did the honors and placed the first bet himself to inaugurate the launch of the industry.</p>
<p>At the time, Gov. Sununu jocosely said that the decision to launch the industry was “the right bet” for New Hampshire. Gov. Sununu was also among the officials to comment on the latest results sports betting has generated for the state.</p>
<p>The New Hampshire Lottery was satisfied with the results, and director Charlie McIntyre confirmed that the regulator’s expectations have been met in full. He further added:</p>
<p>“We look forward to building on our success, while offering our players a completely new way to experience the thrill of winning.”</p>
<p>The state is also getting closer to what could be potentially a big chunk of money. Thanks to NH exclusivity deal with DraftKings, the state will claim 50% of the sportsbook’s profits. A retail extension of the online operations is expected later this year.</p>
<p>Sports betting was legalized in New Hampshire with the backing of Gov. Sununu who signed House Bill 480 into law back in July, 2019, paving the way for NH to tap into a multi-billion industry. At the time, Gov. Sununu said that the sports betting industry will bolster important public spending needs.</p>
<p>New Hampshire has also established the Council for Responsible Gambling which will focus on preventing problem gambling taking hold in the state.</p>
