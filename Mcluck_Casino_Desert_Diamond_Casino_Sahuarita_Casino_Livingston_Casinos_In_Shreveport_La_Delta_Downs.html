<p>In a study conducted by Telsey Group Advisory – a research firm headquartered in New York City – casino resorts missed out on $150 million due to Sin City travelers booking through the online booking service.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Airbnb has seen explosive growth in Las Vegas and the recent Google search trends suggest this will only continue in the near-term,” Telsey analyst Brian McGill said in a recent note. The Las Vegas Review-Journal first reported the findings. “This is a major problem during periods of peak demand that seems to have impacted the rates.”</p>
<p>McGill referenced the Super Bowl weekend and CES annual trade show as two examples of peak periods.</p>
<p>According to Airbnb, there are around 6,500 rental units in Nevada, and most of them are in the southern region of the state. A search for the first week of June for a party of four in Las Vegas turned up more than 1,000 options.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is home to more than 149,000 hotel rooms. They were occupied at a rate of 88.2 percent last year.</p>
<p>Booking Las Vegas</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) released its 2018 Visitor Profile last week, and in it revealed some surprising statistics. The average nightly rate for a guestroom last year was $113.66, which is about the same as 2017.</p>
<p>Sixty-two percent of all guests who handled their own booking used the internet to reserve their rooms. Twenty-one percent went directly through the casino resort’s website, while 41 percent used a third-party site.</p>
<p>Just 15 percent used a telephone to make their Las Vegas reservations.</p>
<p>Ted Newkirk, the founder of Access Vegas – a website featuring tourism information for visitors – told the RJ that Airbnb is an alternative for those who have become disgruntled with higher resort fees, the elimination of free parking, and other added costs.</p>
<p>“Airbnb is a winner for the drive-in customer who is tired of nickel-and-diming. They avoid resort and parking fees, they can ride-share to the Strip or park at one of the free garages, grab supplies at a local store and eat in local restaurants. The combination of those savings really adds up,” Newkirk explained.</p>
<p>Airbnb Extravagances</p>
<p>Among the listings for a weeklong stay in Las Vegas in early June are several first-rate properties available for occupancy.</p>
<p>A 4,000-square-foot penthouse overlooking the Las Vegas Strip featuring two bedrooms, and 2.5-baths is listed for $1,003 per night. For the week including cleaning and service fees, the booking will cost $8,269. The residency features an “over-the-edge” outdoor jacuzzi with views of the gambling mecca.</p>
<p>For those in need of more space, a tropical retreat located five minutes from the Strip offers more than 6,000 square feet of living space, 120″ projection television, 52-foot-long pool, and five bedrooms that can accommodate as many as 16 guests.</p>
