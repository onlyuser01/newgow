<p>Online gambling operator Kindred Group is going to present the group’s latest financial targets at a special event hosted by the company in London on September 14, which will also be available online as a video recording on the group’s website later the same day.</p>
<p>Kindred Group presents Its Strategy and Long-term Priorities for the Coming Years</p>
<p>Kindred Group CEO Henrik Tjärnström and other top executives are going to make a presentation on the group’s business strategy for the next few years and the expected financial results for the period until 2025 during the Capital Markets Day event organized by the group in London.</p>
<p>The key priorities in Kindred Group’s strategy for the long term include market share development with significant focus on the Netherlands, strategic investments and development of the market in North America.</p>
<p>Tjärnström elaborated on these long-term strategic priorities: “We have been a driving force in the transformation of the industry and understood early on the requirements to succeed in a locally regulated and complex environment. We now have critical building blocks in place, and I am fully confident in the direction we are taking.”</p>
<p>For the period from 2021 to 2026, Kindred’s core markets, which are Europe and Australia, are expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. Therefore, Kindred is expecting a growing market share in these regions as the group has already established itself as a go-to entertainment provider.</p>
<p>Kindred got its gaming license for the Netherlands just a couple of months ago in June 2022. The newly launched market has surpassed the expectations of the group, which is on its way to reaching a market share of 15% by the end of the year. As a result, Kindred has made it a key priority to further focus on market growth in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>North America is the other important market where the company expects growth. However, the main focus in that region will be improving the customer experience as it has already become a mature gaming market.</p>
<p>Financial Targets for the Period Until 2025</p>
<p>Kindred Group has announced updated revenue expectations of GBP 1.6 billion ($1.8 billion) for 2025. The Netherlands is expected to become one of the major contributors. However, the target is built upon Kindred Group’s varying portfolio of markets, which are in different stages of development – from newly launched such as the Netherland to already matured territories such as North America.</p>
<p>Based on the expectations for growing revenue, the stability of the core markets, and the group’s constant optimization of costs, Kindred has announced its expectation for underlying EBITDA to be 21-22% in 2025.</p>
<p>Another strategic goal the executives of Kindred Group will be announced during their presentation will be the share of the revenue from gross winnings in regulated markets, which is expected to grow to 90% in 2025. The gross winnings revenue, which the group reached during the first half of 2022, was 78%.</p>
