<p>Last July, premier digital gaming operator PointsBet added live dealer games to its New Jersey casino offerings. Now it is time for its Michigan iGaming platform to benefit from the same expansion. The operator announced it would be bringing its immersive live dealer alternatives to the Great Lakes state.</p>
<p>Michigan Players to Enjoy Live Games by Evolution</p>
<p>The operator has partnered up with top-tier casino software developer Evolution to provide Michigan residents and visitors with the opportunity to access quality live dealer games. The selection of live casino games will cover popular blackjack, baccarat, and roulette titles, including European Roulette, Infinite Blackjack, or Auto Roulette.</p>
<p>Evolution will be streaming its live dealer games out of special broadcast studios based in various jurisdictions throughout all of Michigan. Professional croupiers and dealers will be spinning the roulette wheels, dealing cards, and taking bets to live, in real-time, straight on players’ mobile devices.</p>
<p>PointsBet vice president Aaron O’Sullivan recognized the American market’s growing appetite for digital gambling, thus explaining the company’s decision to expand its portfolio in the state of Michigan. Closely following its Live Your Bet Life campaign motto, PointsBet promises to deliver a fully immersive and authentic casino experience via its smooth, quick, and easy-to-navigate iGaming platform.</p>
<p>The campaign throws the focus on the company’s advanced technology infrastructure considered to be the best in the industry, along with its excellent in-game betting options and clever sports betting strategies. The brand promises to cater to the needs of players and bettors of all levels of experience.</p>
<p>Impressive Expansion оf the Available Games</p>
<p>PointsBet has brought its digital gambling platforms to Michigan in May, four months after launching its sports betting services there. The company also runs operations in West Virginia, Colorado, New Jersey, Indiana, and Iowa. The operator has recently received a license to provide sports betting services to customers in Virginia. PointsBet is currently waiting to be given the green light to begin operation in New York and Maryland.</p>
<p>Outside US borders, PointsBet offers its quality services to passionate bettors in Canada, Ireland, and Australia. The company is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the operator announced it would partner up with the University of Maryland and create a special platform dedicated to students, as well as work together for upcoming philanthropic events. This is a historic partnership between a Big Ten school and a sporting betting operator.</p>
