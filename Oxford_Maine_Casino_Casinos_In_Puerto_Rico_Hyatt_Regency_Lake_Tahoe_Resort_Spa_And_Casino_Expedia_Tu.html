    <h1>Oxford Maine Casino Casinos In Puerto Rico Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa And Casino Expedia Tu</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was in a hotel at the beginning of December (but already in Germany), but not at home. In the hotel itself I had access to WLAN. From there I made a deposit at Wunderwins and in the end the clock stood at 5900 €.</p>
<p>Now, after more than 10 days after I hear nothing from the casino, the payout has been rejected, with the following reason:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are writing to you regarding your withdrawal request of €5,900.00. Unfortunately, we had to decline your withdrawal due to a violation of our terms and conditions, as you were playing with hidden IP addresses or using a VPN.</p>
<p>As a result, your withdrawal request was rejected and the winnings were canceled. Your original deposit has been returned to your balance. You are welcome to submit a new withdrawal request.</p>
<p>The fact is, I did not use a VPN or a hidden IP. It was just the hotel wifi I was playing with. I also have some proof that I was there (booking confirmation of the hotel, payment receipts, etc.)</p>
<p>My original deposit has been returnee and I am able to withdrawal it. For me, this is a contradiction and shows that the casino is simply looking for a reason not to pay out.</p>
