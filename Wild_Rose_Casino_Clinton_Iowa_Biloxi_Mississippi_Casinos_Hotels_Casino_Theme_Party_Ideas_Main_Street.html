    <h1>Wild Rose Casino Clinton Iowa Biloxi Mississippi Casinos Hotels Casino Theme Party Ideas Main Street</h1>

<p>I also had a problem with them, first time I deposited and withdrew there was no problem. The amount was 800 euro, after I deposited a large sum again and managed to climb up to 1300, I then got an email stating that Revolut wasn’t allowed to be withdrawn to. After long communication about the matter and telling them that that’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from an online casino, they processed the 1300. I deposited again a large sum and managed to go up to 3700 the same problem occurred again were they came with the same nonsense about my bank account not being allowed. After debating for a long time they wired the 3700 euro. I deposited 500 euro again after and lost that, I then deposited another large sum and climbed up to 2400, first time I got an email stating I only gambled 100 out of 500 deposit while I lost quite a lot in the process so I didn’t actually believe them but okay. After managing after a great struggle to reach 4400 the same bull crap was used again about my bank account not being allowed, for days the scum kept putting back my balance. For 3 days in total, I was desperate as Revolut is my only bank account and I couldn’t make a Dutch one. From that 4400 I managed to climb to 8500 euro total balance and again requested a withdrawal hoping they would just let me go. And again they kept putting back my balance every time. I then spoke to a live agent named Chris who said to me that there were "technical issues" which prevented them from wiring the money to me, I knew he was lying because his colleagues kept telling me previously that my bank was not "allowed"! Chris told me to request a new withdrawal and that he would put it on the highest priority. Which again was another lie. I placed a wager and loss limit directly after speaking to Chris, 12 hours later my funds were still in my account and not approved. Their Responsible Gambling tools like wager and loss limit which I had put on 10 euro each didn’t work. Playboom/Playboom24 will on purpose drive you crazy when you win a big amount, they will do anything to make you lose your balance as their responsible gambling tools don’t work at all. Don’t deposit a penny here, learn from my mistake to put my trust in them. For 4/5 days they refused to pay me out to the same bank account I used 3 times. Making up excuses. It’s easy for them to make money by doing this. I hope this story will keep people from registering and depositing. Online casinos like these need to die a quick death. After my balance was gone they suddenly sent me an email saying "we will make an exception" these scums knew exactly what they were doing.</p>
