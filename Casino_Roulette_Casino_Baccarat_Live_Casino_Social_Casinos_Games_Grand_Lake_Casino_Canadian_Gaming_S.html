<p>The upcoming Canadian Gaming Summit will feature a number of interesting panels, discussions, and opportunities to establish business collaborations and network. One of the highlights of the event will be the upcoming KeynoteFireside Chat which will see the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority VP of Corporate Affairs Patricia Cook and VP of Human Resources DesireeGervais talk about SIGA’s entry into the digital gaming market and the pioneering approach that the organization has used to establish revenue-sharing models and regulatory agreements.</p>
<p>The "First Nations partnerships: the SIGA model in action" keynote panel will be part of the Leadership &amp; Growth conference track and will take place as part of the event which starts on Tuesday, June 13. The panel itself will be on during the second full core day on Thursday, June 15.</p>
<p>The Canadian Gaming Summit is hosted at the Metro Toronto Convention Center in Toronto, Ontario. Over the past 25 years, SIGA has been able to extend its clout in gambling, with SIGA now operating seven land-based casinos and always seeking ways to innovate. The launch of the company’s online gambling and sports betting website, PlayNow.com, has been a pivotal moment in SIGA’s history and its ability to compete with the commercial gaming sector.</p>
<p>Cook and Gervais will speak about how their organization was able to "perfect" the Gaming Framework Agreement and make it so that SIGA could legally run digital gaming enterprises in the Saskatchewan province of Canada. The panel will seek to explain the success story but also encourage other First Nations to replicate this model and introduce it to their respective provinces, too. The company has been able to achieve an innovative financial model that has increased its growth and established SIGA as a respected pillar of the community.</p>
<p>SBC CEO &amp; Founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity to see Gervais and Cook be a part of the keynote panel and talk about new business models, evolving ways of leveraging one’s brand, and not least - giving back to the community. Dedicating resources to innovation and leadership is an important part of what should drive and inspire other Canadian organizations, something that SIGA’s example would undoubtedly do.</p>
