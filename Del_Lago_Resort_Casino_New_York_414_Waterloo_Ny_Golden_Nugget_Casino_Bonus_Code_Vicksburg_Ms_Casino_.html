<p>How can I join?</p>
<p>To be able to join the tournament, you must be a registered member of Casino Guru. Each player gets a fixed number of spins upon entering the competition, which can be used anytime throughout the tournament. Once the player uses up all of these spins, no additional spins are possible to be obtained and the player must wait for the end of the tournament to learn the results. Registration and participation in the tournament is completely free.</p>
<p>What is the winning prize?</p>
<p>We play for a prize pool of $100 in Amazon Vouchers (or equivalent in a currency that you prefer). The prize pool is divided between top 3 players with the highest scores at the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>The prizes will awarded to the winning players in the following order:</p>
<p>1st place: $50 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>2nd place: $30 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>3rd place: $20 Amazon Voucher</p>
<p>How to win?</p>
<p>The goal is to simply use your fixed number of spins assigned upon registration to spin the reels of the selected title. You collect points for every winning combination or winning multiplier you land.</p>
<p>You can see your score on the left side of the screen, together with the leaderboard and your current position. When you have no spins left, you must wait until the tournament is over to learn the results. At the end of the tournament, all scores are evaluated and the top 3 players with the highest overall scores will receive a portion of the prize fund according to their ranking.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
