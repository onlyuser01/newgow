<p>Novomatic’s Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, Greentube, has managed to notch up a further successful partnership in North America with the company launching its dedicated portfolio in Michigan. The partnership includes BetMGM, and the launch was facilitated via Entain Gaming Group’s platform.</p>
<p>Michigan Becomes Latest iGaming Jurisdiction for Greentube</p>
<p>This makes for a second such collaboration between BetMGM and Greentube with the companies previously introducing their products together in the regulated iGaming market in New Jersey. Following a similar example from their Garden State entry, Greentube is now launching with Mighty Emperor, Mighty Sevens, Diamond Cash, and Mighty Elephant among other games.</p>
<p>Greentube has an impressive portfolio of video slots, table games, reloaded slots, social casino gaming, video bingo, and more. The company makes integration between platforms easy and straightforward thanks to its underpinning omnichannel technology.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that launching for a second time with BetMGM is a major milestone for it as it seeks to expand in the state. Commenting on this opportunity and success, Greentube commercial director David Bolas said:</p>
<p>The US and Michigan in particular are key territories for Greentube. It’s another very important step for us in the context of the wider US market and preparations for launching in Pennsylvania are already underway. Greentube commercial director David Bolas</p>
<p>Bolas clearly hinted that Greentube’s ambitions for the North American market hardly stop at Michigan. The company has been visible in the North American market. At the beginning of the month, Greentube confirmed that it had secured a license to supply its games in the Ontario market.</p>
<p>In an interview with Greentube CFO and CGO Michael Bauer in July, we found out more about the company’s ambitions for the US market. Bauer said that it was crucial for the company to bid it time and move methodically. This gambit has clearly paid off as Greentube is unlikely to relent in its pursuit of a greater foothold in the US market.</p>
