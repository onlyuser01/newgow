<p>Under a partnership extension, Unibet became the Official Sportsbook Partner of the NFL team Philadelphia Eagles. The operator builds upon a business partnership that was inked with the team back in November 2019.</p>
<p>Unibet Extends Partnership with Philadelphia Eagles, Add Sports Betting</p>
<p>The Kindred Group brand Unibet announced the extending of its partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles yesterday. Besides being an Official Casino Partner of the team, Unibet now is an Official Sportsbook Partner. The partnership between the two entities dates back to November 2019 during the last NFL season when Unibet inked the agreement to become an Official Casino Partner.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this season, the NFL changed the rules, allowing Official Sportsbook Partnership designations. Seeing this as an excellent opportunity, Unibet did not wait and expanded its existing partnership with the team.</p>
<p>The Senior Vice President of Revenue and Strategy at Philadelphia Eagles, Catherine Carlson said that the team is excited to grow its partnership with Unibet through new opportunities and initiatives. Furthermore, she stressed that working in collaboration with Unibet has been rewarding over the past year. In conclusion, Carlson said that the team is looking forward to the successful future of the collaboration with Unibet.</p>
<p>A Very Successful Working Partnership</p>
<p>In a statement, Arnas Janickas, VP Marketing US, Kindred Group said that the company is excited to build upon a “very successful working partnership”. Furthermore, he outlined that with the extended collaboration between Unibet and the Philadelphia Eagles, sports fans are going to feel unique and innovative experiences that will last for a long time.</p>
<p>Besides the Philadelphia Eagles, the changing of the rules by the NFL allowed multiple other partnerships to be inked. Back in July, the Denver Super Bowl Champion, the Broncos inked a partnership with BetMGM. Under the agreement, BetMGM became the NFL team’s official sports betting partner.</p>
<p>A similar partnership was signed by PointsBet and the Indianapolis Colts last month. Under the partnership agreement, the global sportsbook operator became an official sports betting partner of the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
