<p>The lading game distributor, QTech Games, announced Wednesday it hired the services of Martin Trang. By joining the company, Trang was appointed as its new chief marketing officer (CMO).</p>
<p>Industry Expert Martin Trang Joins QTech Games</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid QTech Games’ ongoing global expansion. Ultimately, having Trang as CMO, the company seeks to boost its expansion further and capture new market opportunities. Overall, Trang brings more than two decades of experience in the sales and marketing sectors within the iGaming vertical. This will help QTech games diversify its business and at the same time deliver strong results when it comes to marketing strategy, a channel that is increasingly important within the growing gaming industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Trang said that it is exciting to join QTech Games for this full-time position. He explained that the company stands out with unique games that feature flexible technology. What’s more, Trang added that QTech Games has a growing presence in important markets beyond Asia. Combining those two advantages, according to the new CMO, creates unique opportunities for the company.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to be joining such an established and progressive company full-time. Implementing the correct strategy for its “two keystones” model has been pivotal to QTech Games’ sustained success.“ Martin Trang, chief marketing officer at QTech Games</p>
<p>Trang added that QTech Games isn’t only an Asian-facing aggregator but also a “true international distributor of digital entertainment that’s continuing to attract clients from all over the world.” Finally, he predicted further growth for the company and capitalization on new markets.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Strengthen Its Team</p>
<p>Before joining QTech Games, Trang gained more than two decades of experience within the industry. He brings a wealth of knowledge in sales, business development, and product management after holding senior-level positions with leading global companies.</p>
<p>“Following on from Daniel Long’s recent appointment at CCO, we’re thrilled that Martin has agreed to now join us in a permanent, full-time capacity at CMO,“ reads a statement by QTech Games’ Board</p>
<p>Earlier this month, QTech Games hired Daniel Long as its new CCO. Now, following the new senior-level hire, the company’s Board revealed that it is thrilling to expand its team and add an industry expert such as Trang. The company’s Board added that Trang’s appointment comes ahead of a planned strategic expansion set for next year. Last but not least, QTech Games noted: “We’re confident these appointments will assist us in achieving our goals, chiefly powered by clear tactical focus around the customer experience, innovation tech and, of course, our own brand and its resilient values.”</p>
