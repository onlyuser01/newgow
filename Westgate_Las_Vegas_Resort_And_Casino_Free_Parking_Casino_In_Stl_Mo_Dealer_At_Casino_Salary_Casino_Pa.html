<p>After what appeared to be initial hesitation, Kindred Group has finally acquired a license from the Dutch Gambling Authority, Kansspelautoriteit, and can launch on the highly coveted market from today onwards. However, the actual rollout of Unibet.nl may need to wait a few days. The move market-entry marks the end of the company’s transformative journey after the company had to miss the initial launch date in November and returns with renewed strengths today.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Kindred Group will be authorized to service the Dutch market and provide gambling products as per its license under the Remote Gambling Act. This marks an important milestone for the company as it has been able to ensure entry into its 20th local market, an important overall step for the company.</p>
<p>"The Netherlands is a large and important European market and one that we look forward to operating in with a local license," commented Kindred Group Chief Executive Officer Henrik Tjärnström.</p>
<p>Tjärnström continued by adding how important entering individual markets have become for the company. Kindred Group worked hard to make this launch a reality, the executive explained. He also added that moving forward, the company will be entirely focusing on providing a fair and sustainable experience.</p>
<p>Dutch regulators have been particularly demanding from local licensees, asking them to comply with a ream of regulatory measures and norms. The Dutch Gaming Authority even issued a few warningsin private and argued that stakeholders need to step up their game when it comes to advertising practices.</p>
<p>Having entered the market a bit later, Kindred Group will have the opportunity to learn from these developments. Company Chief Commercial officer Anne-Jaap Snijders said that Kindred Group was happy to bring its flagship brand, Unibet.</p>
<p>Snijders also mentioned the "Unibet Impact" program designed to bolster safe and responsible online gambling. The Netherlands is a turning point for the company. Kindred confirmed that it will be hosting a Capital Markets Day on September 14 in London and a big focus of this event will be on its strategic and long-term goals for the Dutch gaming market.</p>
<p>Kindred Group had a few spats with the Dutch Gaming Authority over the years over "rogue operations," but the company and the regulator have put this behind them now and will work together on bringing one of the best portfolios of gaming products to consumers in the Netherlands.</p>
