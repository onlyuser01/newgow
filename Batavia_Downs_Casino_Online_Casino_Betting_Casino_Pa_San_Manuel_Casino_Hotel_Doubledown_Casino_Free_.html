<p>The request for proposal process is expected to start next year with the successful bidder tasked to develop a centralized self-exclusion system that caters to Ontario's online gambling operators and players</p>
<p>iGaming Ontario (iGO), the government agency that acts as a subsidiary of the gambling regulator in Ontario, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), and responsible for managing online gambling activities, announced its plans for the development of a centralized self-exclusion solution. The subsidiary confirmed that it intends to build a safer iGaming market that ensures exciting experiences for all players in Ontario and supports self-exclusion options.</p>
<p>As a result, iGO said that it plans to initiate a request for proposals (RFP) next year. The goal of the process is the development of a “centralized self-exclusion solution that will enable a player to self-exclude from all Ontario regulated iGaming operators in a single registration process,” explains a statement released by the iGaming regulator.</p>
<p>The new system is expected to be suitable for all licensed gambling operators in the province, including Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation’s online gambling website. The successful bidder of the RFP will be tasked with the development of the new self-exclusion system. Besides integrating with all gambling operators in Ontario, the new system must provide players across the province with options for self-exclusion registration, as well as reinstatement and renewal.</p>
<p>The new system is expected to be an innovative and secure cloud-based SaaS solution that complies with the existing regulatory framework. At the same time, the solution is expected to maintain “the trust and confidence of a wide range of stakeholders,” the iGO confirmed. The company that successfully passes the bidding process will enter into a multi-year agreement with iGO to develop and deliver this technology.</p>
<p>The RFP is expected to start early in 2024. Companies that are interested can apply on MERX. Currently, iGO has not confirmed when the successful bidder will be announced.</p>
<p>An Innovative, Secure and Robust Self-Exclusion System</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after earlier this year iGO’s executive director, Martha Otton, hinted at plans for a centralized self-exclusion solution. The confirmation of the system comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of the launch of the regulated gambling market in Ontario.</p>
<p>According to iGO, the newly centralized self-exclusion system is expected to be supportive and player-focused. Moreover, the centralized system needs to ensure the secure storing of player data while at the same time offering enough information for players and iGaming operators.</p>
<p>The iGO said that the new system needs to offer processes that are practical and manageable for the licensed operators. Another requirement of the system is the implementation of effective policies that protect the players.</p>
