<p>It’s a sign of the operator’s continued commitment to integrity and its focus on gaining trust. This is the second membership for the Association this year.</p>
<p>Joining over 40 Other Companies</p>
<p>Simplebet offers micro-betting products and is a globally recognized specialist in its niche. Joining the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) means it will be subjected to the same industry-recognized standards for integrity as more than 40 other companies, along with north of 100 sports betting brands part of IBIA, totaling more than $135 billion in combined betting handle annually.</p>
<p>Integrity and trust are non-negotiable at Simplebet, so we are excited to be partnering with the IBIA, who are the world’s leading independent integrity monitor. Melissa Davis, executive vice president of business affairs and general counsel, Simplebet</p>
<p>Joining efforts with IBIA also means joining around 50% of all regulated commercial betting done by current members of IBIA.</p>
<p>IBIA welcomed Simplebet amid its ranks very warmly. “I am very pleased to welcome Simplebet to IBIA; its membership highlights the operator’s commitment to protecting the integrity of betting and related sporting events,” said Khalid Ali – the chief executive of IBIA.</p>
<p>The addition of Simplebet adds to IBIA’s North American presence and continues its expansion into the US especially.</p>
<p>JACK Entertainment’s sports betting brand betJACK also joined IBIA recently, being the first one to do so for 2023. BetJACK operates in Ohio’s recently regulated sports betting market, and has both land-based as well as online operations. Ohio’s new market has been gaining strong popularity, especially after GeoComply’s data showed it surpassed New York’s sports betting market launch.</p>
<p>Micro-Betting Picking Up Speed</p>
<p>Micro-betting has also been gaining popularity lately, with Caesars Entertainment partnering with Simplebet just last month. The multi-year partnership will see Simplebet offer its products to the operator’s sportsbook, meaning Caesars sportsbook clients throughout the country will be able to now place micro bets on minute happenings in matches. Bet365 and DraftKings are also in with Simplebet.</p>
<p>The news came hot on the heels of news that Simplebet will make micro-betting available to more than 2,500 NCAAB games for the season, which itself is great news, as more than 30 states already have sports betting – college basketball included – legalized. The success of Major League Baseball for 2022 bodes well for the near future of Simplebet.</p>
<p>Although Simplebet’s micro-betting products recorded around $262 million in placed bets for the MLB season, it was noteworthy that micro-betting activity increased further even after the season concluded. Maybe Jake Paul was onto something with the launch of Betr after all, although his offering is unique in the sense that it also serves as a platform for sports content.</p>
