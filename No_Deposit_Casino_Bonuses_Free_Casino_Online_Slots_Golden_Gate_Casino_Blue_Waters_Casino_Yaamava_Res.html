<p>William Hill determined to boost US footprint with NBA partnership</p>
<p>NBA endorses the deal pointing out that WH is an accomplished global sportsbook</p>
<p>William Hill is relocating most of its efforts from the United Kingdom in the USA</p>
<p>British bookmaker William Hill has become the latest sports betting partner of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>
<p>William Hill Joins NBA as Official Sports Betting Partner</p>
<p>William Hill has become the official National Basketball Association (NBA) sports betting partner in the United States, the company has revealed. As per the specific agreement, William Hill will be able to use official NBA betting data to provide sports fans and bettors with odds and lines in the country and beyond.</p>
<p>The British bookmaking company will similarly use NBA branding across multiple platforms, including its mobile and desktop sportsbooks and social channels. NBA has agreed to display William Hill promotional materials across the league‚Äôs social media channels, the official website and the dedicate NBA app.</p>
<p>üèÄ William Hill is now a Proud Partner and an Authorized Sports Betting Operator of the @NBA! üèÄ ‚Äî William Hill US (@WilliamHillUS) October 2, 2019</p>
<p>While integrity fees are now a thing of the past, the company and the sporting organization said that they would look to strengthen integrity across the board. Here‚Äôs what William HILL US VP for Strategy and Business Development Dan Shapiro said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are proud of this creative partnership that benefits our customers and our partners nationwide while promoting legalized wagering on NBA events. The NBA has been a leader in recognizing the benefits of a legal sports betting market.‚Äù</p>
<p>Shapiro expects that this is only the beginning of a longer overall partnership with the NBA, which will translate into similar deals with other leagues.</p>
<p>NBA‚Äôs Scott Kaufman-Ross, an SVP and Head of Fantasy and Gaming within the organization, reminded that William Hill is a sportsbook with a global outreach and intact reputation. In addition, he expressed the NBA‚Äôs enthusiasm to be teaming up with the bookmaker:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are delighted to partner with William Hill as they grow their business throughout the US and are excited to work together to provide a world-class experience to our fans.‚Äù</p>
<p>William Hill‚Äôs US Ambitions</p>
<p>William Hill previously signed a contract with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the company‚Äôs the first official betting partner of the league as well.</p>
<p>For a while now, the British bookmaker has been pushing actively across the United States. The company already has operations in Nevada, Iowa, Mississippi, New Jersey and others. Similarly, the operator is hoping that the United States will make up for some difficulties back at home.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, a new limit on FOBTs has forced the company‚Äôs hand to close 700 betting shops and lay off as many as 4,500 employees. Employee layoffs haven‚Äôt been enacted yet, as the company is looking for a way to re-train existing staff, possibly even relocate if need is.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Asher, William Hill CEO for the United States, has repeatedly expressed his support of the expansion in the country. Not only that, but William Hill is hoping to generate 45% of its total revenue in the United States, a formidable amount.</p>
<p>The NBA has gone from being a staunch opponent to sports betting to inking several deals with renown gaming companies, such as FanDuel and The Stars Group. The Stars Group is currently being bought by Flutter Entertainment.</p>
