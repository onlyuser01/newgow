    <h1>Casino Royale Where Filmed Casino Free Spins No Deposit Delaware Online Casino Del Sol Casino Tucson</h1>

<p>The true winners will be the NJ customers who will now have access to a platform that will give them safe and enjoyable gambling experiences</p>
<p>Several days after the review of its strategic alternatives, Kindred, a global gambling holding consisting of several brands, has launched its proprietary tech platform in the state of New Jersey. The platform will leverage a rich set of analytics and data to make the customer experience better and safer.</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s in-house Kindred Platform is now live in the United States after securing the necessary regulatory approvals. The company’s proprietary gaming platform was greenlit by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) earlier this year, allowing it to launch the solution in the Garden State.</p>
<p>The foray into New Jersey represents a major development for the company, which seeks to solidify its NA presence and roll out the platform across its US footprint.</p>
<p>According to the gambling giant, the new platform will provide an “enhanced customer experience with customizable and personalized content and products.” In addition to that, the platform will sport improved analytics and flexibility, Kindred said.</p>
<p>The tech platform, which has just begun its rollout in America, is an integral part of Kindred’s business in other markets, such as Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>The Real Winners Will Be the NJ Customers</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s chief executive officer, Henrik Tjärnström, commented on the launch of the Kindred Platform in New Jersey, saying that he is very proud of his team’s hard work. However, the true winners will be the customers in New Jersey, Tjärnström said, as they will now have access to a platform that will give them safer and more enjoyable gambling experiences.</p>
<p>Kindred will now proceed to roll out the tech platform across the company’s business in the United States, launching it in every state where it operates. A launch in Pennsylvania is planned for H2 2023.</p>
<p>We are now preparing to roll out the tech platform to all the states we operate in. Our aim is to migrate Pennsylvania to the Kindred platform during the second half of the year. Henrik Tjärnström, CEO, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Kindred Continues to Safely Expand</p>
<p>In other news, Kindred just secured an agreement with Booming Games, a developer of iGaming titles. The latter company agreed to supply the operator’s gambling brands with its full portfolio of slots.</p>
<p>As a result, customers of Bingo.com, Maria Casino and Unibet in Belgium, the UK and Malta are now able to enjoy dozens of new games.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kindred continues its Journey Toward Zero, seeking to minimize its profits from problem players.</p>
