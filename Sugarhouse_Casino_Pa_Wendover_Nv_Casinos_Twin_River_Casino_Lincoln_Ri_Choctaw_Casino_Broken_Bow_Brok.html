    <h1>Sugarhouse Casino Pa Wendover Nv Casinos Twin River Casino Lincoln Ri Choctaw Casino Broken Bow Brok</h1>

<p>Hello, how about more than 10 days ago I had some winnings at WINPOT CASINO, so I chose to withdraw at the beginning because it was the first time I had withdrawn, they asked me for several documents beforehand, I understand that since they want to confirm that it is the owner of the account who receives the money, I sent everything they asked me, they gave me a period of 24 to 72 hours, which I had to wait approximately 5 days to have a concrete answer since the matter was crossed Saturday and Sunday and after 5 days they contacted me to request information of a card and an authorization letter signed by the holder of that card since they had lent me the card but the funds were mine, it was something that seemed somewhat exaggerated to me due to the fact that to deposit you can deposit without so much requirement but At the time of withdrawing, if they get a little stricter, in short, I sent everything that they requested in relation to that card so that they could corroborate that in reality the funds were mine, hard or It took approximately 5 days for them to verify those documents until they finally told me that my withdrawal had already been authorized because I only had to wait 24 to 72 more hours for the funds to arrive on my card. After that I receive an email where They say that my bank account was blocked and they could not process the transfer or that I had possibly reached my limit of funds, to which I called the customer service area of my bank so they tell me that my account at no time It has been blocked and my account had no limit to receive transfers, so I went and told the technical area of WINPOT CASINO that, so it's been more than three days and they tell me that they are about to process the deposit that doesn't take long. get my money and I don't really see any other excuse why my withdrawal is not expedited</p>
