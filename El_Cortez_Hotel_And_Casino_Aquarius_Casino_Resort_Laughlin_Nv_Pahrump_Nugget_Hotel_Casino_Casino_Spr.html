<p>We’re now going to preview the MNF game, dissecting the NFL odds, and sharing our top betting picks along the way</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos are 3-5 in the 2023 NFL season, which makes them one of the worst teams in the league. However, they’ve shown that they can play well against big favorites. Two weeks ago, for example, they defeated the defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>Can they produce another miracle? The Broncos vs. Bills odds suggest that they stand no chance against Sean McDermott and his boys. However, given that the Bills haven’t been in great shape lately, maybe we could see the visitors from Colorado make the game way more interesting than what the odds make us think.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Buffalo Bills Odds</p>
<p>Denver Broncos Odds Denver Broncos +7.5 -110 Buffalo Bills -7.5 -110</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Denver Broncos +285 Buffalo Bills -365</p>
<p>Points Total Odds Over 47 -110 Under 47 -110</p>

<p>Denver Broncos Feel Good About Their Future Following Win Over Kansas</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Broncos defeated the Chiefs 24-9. It was one of Russell Wilson’s best games since making Denver his home last year. The legendary quarterback went 12-for-19 passes for 114 passing yards and three touchdowns, with zero interceptions. As if that wasn’t enough, he also made eight carries for 30 rushing yards.</p>
<p>Denver’s offense was sublime in that game, but it’s their defense that deserves applause. They were able to keep the NFL’s most dangerous offense to just 9 points. That’s the lowest number of points Kansas scored in more than two years.</p>

<p>The Broncos defense forced Patrick Mahomes to throw two interceptions while recording no TDs. That’s something that hasn’t happened to the reigning NFL MVP since the 2020 season.</p>
<p>Sean Payton’s men did great against the Chiefs, but can they produce the same level of performance against the Buffalo Bills? Well, they’ve had an extra week to prepare for this game due to a bye, while the Bills are coming off a loss in a very intense game last Sunday.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills are Back Home Where They’re 100% in 2023</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills lost to the Cincinnati Bengals 24-18 last weekend at Paycor Stadium in Cincy. They weren’t too bad, but the hosts were just better. That’s not much of a surprise given that Sean McDermott’s men prefer playing on their turf.</p>
<p>These guys are 5-4 overall with all four of their losses happening away from Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, NY. This includes one London game (vs. Jacksonville Jaguars), in which the Bills were labeled as the home team.</p>
<p>When it comes to the games they’ve played at their stadium in the 2023 season, they have all wins. They’re 4-0 at home, with wins over the Las Vegas Raiders, Miami Dolphins, New York Giants, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
<p>They did win all of their home games this season, but only in two of those did they cover the point spread. Will they be able to cover it this time when the Broncos are coming to town?</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Buffalo Bills MNF Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills are a much better team than the Broncos, so even if the game wasn’t played at Highmark Stadium, we’d still back them. At Highmark Stadium, we think there’s no way the Broncos can beat them. However, we do suspect that the Bills might struggle to cover the spread, which is set to 7.5 points.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win but not cover the spread</p>
