    <h1>Online Casinos Games Casino Hotel Rooms Casino Royale Offers Seneca Allegany Casino Hotel Casino Slo</h1>

<p>Hello. The problem arose on September 25. I requested a withdrawal. At the moment, my account is fully verified (I have uploaded an identity document, as well as confirmation of the payment method). After 24 hours they denied me the withdrawal and asked me to send a selfie with a document. I have completed this application. The casino did not give a response for 3 days (although when uploading the document it is indicated that the processing time of the document is up to 24 hours). In support, they told me that my photo would not be accepted, it supposedly had some kind of filters and they asked me for a new photo. I took a new photo with a digital camera. He also refused and was asked to take 3 selfies from different angles. I did all this on September 27th. The casino stopped giving information again. And just a week later, on October 5, they wrote to me that the photo on my document was invalid and they needed a new one. Although this photo was taken more than 2 months ago. And those 3 selfies were rejected without explanation, the site also said that the account was blocked. I uploaded a photo of the document, but still no response. In the support chat they answer me that my account is under study and the terms are not called. I think the Casino decided to take my money. I am extremely upset that the site accepted my deposit in a split second and I have not been able to receive a payment for a month. At the same time, the casino requested a large amount of personal data. I also spend a lot of time on these complaints and contact the site support.</p>
