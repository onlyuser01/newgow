<p>Jokaroom</p>
<p>Tonight I just paid for several spins on Temple Tumble and on Tower Tumble but the spins never actually happened, in effect they took my money and didn’t give me what I paid for.</p>
<p>This happens very often on these games and also TNT Tumble. After I press spin, the slots empty of the previous game then nothing happens for a little bit before up on the screen comes "waiting for connection" and then "partner cashier error 522". At first the money looks like it hasn’t been taken out but once I close the game to go to the home screen the money is missing.</p>
<p>I’ve overlooked this for a while now but it happens far too much and I’ve lost more dollars than I can accurately recall over the duration of playing at this casino and I’m fed up. So I made a complaint about it tonight and the resolution I received was 10 free spins on Tower Tumble worth a total of $1.00 AUD.</p>
<p>This has been happening to $8.00 spins at times and I brought it to their attention back then but was told I needed to clear my cache and cookies which I did. That had no effect though and the problem kept happening. I was doing well at the time though and so just thought I’d ignore it for the time being to see if things improved.</p>
<p>They did not and so when it happened for several spins in a row when I was playing with only the small amount I had available to me tonight, I sent them a message again as it is tantamount to stealing even if accidental. I hoped they would reverse it but I was left very disappointed.</p>
