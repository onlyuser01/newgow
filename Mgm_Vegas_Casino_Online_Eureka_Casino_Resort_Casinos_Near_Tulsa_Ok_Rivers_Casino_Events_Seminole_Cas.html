<p>Sportradar, an international data and technology company focusing on the business of sports, has been picked by the National Hockey League to assist the latter with the organization’s international streaming service. Thanks to this new partnership, Sportradar will use its expertise in sports and big data to help enhance and refresh the existing NHL.tv which is a subscription service that fans based outside of the United States and Canada may use to keep track of the sports action in real-time and never miss an opportunity to place a bet or share a big moment from the sport.</p>
<p>This direct-to-consumer solution will now benefit further from Sportradar’s own dedicated over-the-top (OTT) technology which will make it easier for the NHL to manage the workflow of its platform and ensure better results and experiences for subscribers. To help make management and execution easier, Sportradar will grant the NHL access to both the backend and frontend applications developed by the data specialist.</p>

NHL Senior EVP for Digital Media &amp; Strategic Planning Stephen McArdle said that international NHL fans are "extremely" savvy, and they deserve to have access to the same products and insight that North American fan bases do.</p>
<p>"Sportradar’s refresh of NHL.TV for certain international markets will help provide fans around the world with a more personalized and enhanced experience with the game, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with Sportradar to deliver a best-in-class international direct-to-consumer platform," McArdle added.</p>
