    <h1>Casino Near Me With Slots Machine Casino In Bristol Va The Gardens Casino North Star Mohican Casino</h1>

<p>I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to tell you about a problem I'm having with my Windetta casino account.</p>
<p>My registration details and the document I've provided, including a Polish bank statement, show that I legally live and work in Poland.</p>
<p>Recently, my account was closed because of my supposed residency in Ukraine. Here is the email I received from the casino:</p>
<p>"Dear Kateryna V<strong><em>*</em></strong>*,</p>
<p>The Windetta Casino Risk Department has thoroughly reviewed your login PLAYER1362071.</p>
<p>Account PLAYER1362071 - did not pass the casino security check.</p>
<p>A detailed check of your account revealed a violation of the project rules, namely:</p>
<p>2.7. When it comes to gambling laws, they vary from country to country. Below is a list of countries where online gambling is prohibited and therefore you cannot create an account: UK, USA, France, Netherlands, Ukraine (including temporarily occupied territories), Curacao, Aruba, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, Saba. , Dutch West Indies, Statia, Singapore, Republic of Moldova.</p>
<p>Upon verification, it turned out that you are a resident of a prohibited country - Ukraine. Your country is on the restricted list and therefore we cannot accept or serve users from that region.</p>
<p>Due to a violation of the project rules, your balance has been canceled and your PLAYER1362071 account has been closed without the right to reopen.</p>
<p>The casino is not responsible for your opening a new account or any losses you may incur after opening a new account. We reserve the right to close an account created in violation of these rules at any time.</p>
<p>This decision is final and cannot be revised."</p>
<p>As you can see, Poland, the country I played from is NOT on the list of the prohibited countries. But, the casino people treat me as if I played from Ukraine, which is an absurd. Is it done in order not to pay my legitimate winnings?</p>
<p>My account balance is 563 EUR, which I won fairly through my gameplay. I've heard that my winnings might be taken away due to this residency mix-up.</p>
<p>I kindly request that you review my case and reopen my account. I believe it's important for Windetta casino to honor the terms and conditions I followed when I first joined. A quick and fair solution would mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>I understand there are rules to follow, but they should be based on accurate information. The documents I've provided prove that I'm living and playing from Poland.</p>
<p>If you need more information from me, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm looking forward to a quick response and a solution that's fair for both of us.</p>
