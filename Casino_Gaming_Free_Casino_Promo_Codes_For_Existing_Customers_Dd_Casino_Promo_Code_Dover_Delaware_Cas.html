<p>Poker Tournament by The Venetian Announced</p>
<p>The Venetian in Las Vegas has announced a poker tournament which will take place on Friday and Saturday this week. This is the first operator in Las Vegas to introduce poker tournaments after the end of the COVID-19 saga. The tournament has a buy-in set for $250 and the starting times for both Friday and Saturday are 11:10 am. Participants who want to join must be 21 years or older and need to carry a valid ID in order to collect winnings. The winners can choose between receiving payment in cash or casino chips.</p>
<p>The tournament will be limited to a maximum of 80 players. A minimum of 32 players are required to start the tournament. In the event of not reaching this number, the tournament will be changed to individual $250 No Limit Hold’em five player max single table winner take all tournament.</p>

<p>Insight on the Tournament</p>
<p>The maximum number of participants in the tournament is set to 80. If the max number of players sign up for the tournament, they will be divided into sixteen tables of five players per table. This will be Round One of the tournament. From the buy-in of $250, $25 is held as an entry fee, while $15 is held as staff-related fees. In other words, the prize pool gets $210 out of every $250 buy-in. Players start with 10,000 chips in Round One. Winners who beat everyone on their table in Round One go to Round Two.</p>
<p>Round Two will feature four tables with four players per each table. All of those players will start with 20,000 chips. The winner at each table from Round Two continues to Round Three. The final round of the tournament will meet the best four out of 80 players. All players who reach this phase will begin with 30,000 chips. The tournament ends when one player has all of the chips in the game.</p>
<p>In the event that there are at least 48 participants, the final two players from each round two or 8 players in total will receive a monetary prize. The prizes will be determined by the Tournament Director. In case there are less than 48 players, only the best four players will receive a prize. The prize money will be announced and will depend on the number of players signed for each event.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Casinos Operate Under Strict Social Distancing and Enhanced Cleaning Protocols</p>
<p>Besides the Venetian, only a few other operators have their poker rooms open. The other two operators who offer poker rooms in Las Vegas are the Golden Nugget, the South Point, and the Orleans. Although the shutdown of operations due to COVID-19 is no longer in effect, casino operators who would like to resume or have already resumed business have to follow strict social distancing and sanitation protocols.</p>
<p>Part of those restrictive measures is limiting the gaming venues to only 50% of capacity. Hand sanitizers will be available for the visitors, casino employees will need to wear PPE such as mask or face shields. In addition, all operators will implement frequent sanitation of high traffic areas. The cleaning equipment is also going to be disinfected at regular intervals.</p>
