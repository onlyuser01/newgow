    <h1>Casino Mine Ranch Dreams Casino No Deposit Casino Lisboa Fond Du Luth Casino Sunscape Cura ao Resort</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply, I really appreciate that. I would like to start off by saying that I am a sick person, I suffer from diabetes, so I appreciate that you will take my request fully first</p>
<p>I registered at 5GRINGOS Casino on August 4th, 2023</p>
<p>I deposited via my mobile phone with the online banking app, which I can prove</p>
<p>I played using my best friend's IP address because I don't have a good internet connection on my cell phone</p>
<p>I deposited €50 with 150% bonus up to €75</p>
<p>I played with my real money first</p>
<p>and i won with real money what i can prove is 200€ which i wanted to cash out first and then changed my mind to continue playing</p>
<p>I canceled the €75 bonus and was allowed to withdraw the money for real money, which I can prove is €200</p>
<p>As I said, I changed my mind and continued to play with this €200</p>
<p>First I wanted to withdraw 200€ yes but after this withdrawal request the casino started to treat me unfairly and to act fraudulently</p>
<p>it directly has problems with the payout</p>
<p>Given First the live chat staff said it's a technical error Happened we apologize for that</p>
<p>I should try to pay out the money again so said so done</p>
<p>exactly Where they wanted to pay me the money should I suddenly verify myself up to this point no verification was necessary</p>
<p>I ran out of patience, I canceled the €200 that was being paid out in my account and was lucky enough to win €1,000</p>
<p>I then decided to do so and decided to patiently withdraw the €1,000 and wait for verification</p>
<p>First I verified my identity and it was approved</p>
<p>second I verified my address it was also approved</p>
<p>Third, I was asked to upload a bank statement from 06/01/2023 to 08/08/2023 I did that</p>
<p>I uploaded the file as a PDF</p>
<p>I downloaded the file in my online banking app as a PDF FILE and uploaded the file as a PDF under my account during verification, just like I was asked to do</p>
<p>I reported it to the live chat they told me not to worry</p>
<p>i will get my payout soon</p>
<p>and the document will be verified and approved in no time</p>
<p>Please wait for confirmation from the finance department</p>
<p>The live chat checked my account beforehand and everything was ok. I received confirmation that I was allowed to play</p>
<p>I always ask in live chat beforehand if I can play with them just for my own safety I am registered on several casino sites under this license and administration my data and documents are the same I can show you several emails showing my email address where I have deposited and withdrawn and am registered</p>
<p>I can show you bank statements where I have won funds and lost funds under this license and administration with the same account number and bank connection of the casino</p>
<p>I would like to say that at the same time there was also a payout of €1000 in my account at 7Signs Casino</p>
<p>which I've been lucky enough to win in many different slots</p>
<p>I got the emails of 2 times 500€ to confirm the payout</p>
<p>I have also opened a 2 complaint so that the topic does not get confused</p>
<p>I deposited with 5 gringos in the same day and deposited with 7Signs in the same day</p>
<p>€50 at 5 GRINGOS CASINO</p>
<p>€50 at 7SIGNS CASINO</p>
<p>After I was blocked at 5GRINGOS on the grounds that I violated the terms and conditions, which I didn't do, I was blocked at their partner casino 7SIGNS at the same time</p>
<p>7 SIGNS could not tell me why I was blocked</p>
<p>and why i can no longer access their services i got all the conversations from live chat where even the staff were shocked why my account got banned</p>
<p>I would like to mention that I also have 1000€ in the payout at 7SIGNS</p>
<p>When I asked in live chat what would happen to my withdrawals, 7Signs Casino told me to verify myself first in order to be able to receive my withdrawal NO REASON WITHOUT REASON</p>
<p>when i asked how to verify because my account was blocked without any information and without a reason they said i should wait for an email from the tax authority for verification i have not received any email yet</p>
<p>Apart from that, no verification at 7SIGNS was necessary either. I received confirmation from several employees that I would receive the first payout on August 11th, 2023 and that no verification is currently necessary AND EXACTLY ON August 11th, 2023, both accounts were blocked</p>
