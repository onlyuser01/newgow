    <h1>Nyc Casinos Funzpoints Casino Real Money Casino Food Casino Sign Up Bonus Honolulu Casino BitWin Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I received a 200 EUR bonus at Bitwin. I used this bonus to play and managed to win 2250 EUR after reaching the wagering requirement.</p>
<p>However, the withdrawal of my winnings was denied because, according to Bitwin, I exceeded the "Maximum Bet" limit.</p>
<p>I played the games 'JetX' and 'Book of Sun'. The problem, according to Bitwin, was that in JetX, I made three bets of 5 EUR each, totalling 15 EUR. The bonus conditions are unclear to me, they do not state that I cannot place three individual bets of 5 EUR each - Bitwin counts these as 15 EUR. As far as I'm concerned, these are three separate bets since I've never had any issues when doing similar on other sites, for instance, in the game 'Aviator' where I also placed two 5 EUR bets. Since these are three separate bets, it was not clear to me that this was not allowed.</p>
<p>Even when I asked in the chat during the bonus, I was simply told that the manager would be informed. The manager subsequently gave the 'ok' - not only to this issue, but also another one. Initially, it was claimed that the maximum payout of the bonus was 200 EUR.</p>
<p>In the terms and conditions it only states, "the maximum bet while wagering is 5 EUR". It also states that "the max bet limit includes bets doubling after a game round has been completed and bonus rounds". There's nothing therein about situations like JetX. That's why I only played with 5 EUR per bet. It's like a sports betting bonus being canceled because a person has placed three bets simultaneously. You won't find any information on this in the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>A brief note:</p>
<p>I did not win anything in the game JetX, my winnings came entirely from the game 'Book of Sun'.</p>
<p>I implore you to look into this matter and let me know your viewpoint. The game JetX simply involves three jets taking off, each of which, in my opinion, is its own separate game, as the jets independently crash or don't. I have been playing casino games for quite some time, and I am usually well-versed with the terms of bonus conditions. I have never had any issues with withdrawal whenever I've won something.</p>
