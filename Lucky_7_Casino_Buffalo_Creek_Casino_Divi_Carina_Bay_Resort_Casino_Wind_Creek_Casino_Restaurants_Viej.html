    <h1>Lucky 7 Casino Buffalo Creek Casino Divi Carina Bay Resort Casino Wind Creek Casino Restaurants Viej</h1>

<p>You can’t win if you don’t play is a mantra that many gamblers tell themselves to continue to gamble. Without any doubt, jackpots are hard to hit, but given that enough players are interested, it appears that jackpots can also drop frequently. This is precisely the case for the Mega Millions jackpot that dropped twice within a week. It was last Friday, April 14, when one lucky winner that purchased a ticket in New York hit the staggering $483 million jackpot.</p>
<p>Now, immediately after the big win, the jackpot from the popular game dropped once again. During the drawing on Tuesday night, a single ticket sold in New York matched all numbers correctly. The lucky winner guessed the white balls 7, 9, 15, 19 and 25, as well as the gold Mega Ball 4, hitting the base Mega Millions jackpot of approximately $20 million (or $10.5 million in cash).</p>
<p>But Tuesday’s drawing didn’t bring a single big prize. Smaller prizes were also handed out as four lucky gamblers matched five white balls. Each of the winners secured a second-tier prize of $1 million. Additionally, 27 winners guessed four white balls and the gold Mega Ball. From that total, seven secured a $20,000 prize via the game’s Megaplier, while the rest of the lucky players received $10,000.</p>
<p>Jackpot Deja Vu</p>
<p>There are lucky few that are able to hit a jackpot, taking home tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet, although hitting the jackpot is quite difficult, given the odds, the recent wins don’t come as a huge surprise, given that the same thing has happened before.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, on January 13, 2023, which happened to be Friday, a winning ticket purchased in Lebanon, Maine, hit the $1.35 billion-dollar jackpot from Mega Millions. Then, not even a week later, just like what happened recently, another base-level jackpot dropped. On January 17, 2023, days after the $1.35 billion-dollar jackpot win, a lucky player from New York hit the base-level Mega Millions jackpot of approximately $20 million.</p>
