    <h1>New Casino In Vegas Doubleu Casino Free Chips Facebook Yellow Brick Road Casino Chittenango Paddy Po</h1>

<p>The provider of popular content for the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced a new partnership. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it joined forces with SA Esportes, a leading operator in the Brazilian market. Under the terms of the new deal, the company agreed to supply the Brazilian operator with content from its three verticals: Virtual Sports, Live Casino and Slots content.</p>
<p>The new deal expands further Pragmatic Play's growing portfolio of partners and at the same time delivers popular games for SA Esportes' customers. Per the terms of the new collaboration, clients of the operator will access football, greyhound and horse racing products, as well as other Virtual Sports products including Force 1 from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deal brings award-winning games such as Gates of Olympus and Sugar Rush for customers of the operator. SA Esportes' clients will also gain access to leading Live Casino games from Pragmatic Play such as Mega Wheel and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, as well as recently released slot hits including Big Bass - Keeping it Reel and Sword of Ares.</p>
<p>A representative for SA Esportes commented on the topic saying in a statement saying: "The variety of content featured in Pragmatic Playâ€™s portfolio is truly unmatched in the iGaming landscape, and we will be privileged to be able to offer their products to our customers." Finally, the representative noted: "We expect them to be impressed by the sheer variety of content that will be available to them, and expect to see a significant boost to our metrics as a consequence."</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's Vice President of Latin American Operations, Victor Arias, added: "We're delighted to take three of our most prominent verticals with another up-and-coming Brazilian operator." He outlined that the company continues to grow its footprint in the region and that new collaboration provides a further boost. In conclusion, Arias said that Pragmatic Play hopes to reach new audiences in Brazil via the new deal with SA Esportes.</p>
<p>The collaboration with SA Esportes comes on the heels of another deal announced by Pragmatic Play recently. Earlier this week, the company inked a content partnership with the leading UK operator MrQ. The content deal helps expand the reach of Pragmatic's products and provided a nice boost for MrQ's offering.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in February, Pragmatic announced the launch of its cowboy-themed adventure title called Wild West Duels. The new slot reaffirms the company's ongoing goal to grow its portfolio by up to eight games a month.</p>
