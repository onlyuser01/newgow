    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Casinos En Austin Texas Casino Oregon Avantegarde Casino Hol</h1>

<p>Under the terms of the new partnership, SIS will provide bet365 with a brand new game, Lotto365, designed to strengthen the operator’s presence in the online lottery vertical and elevate the player experience.</p>
<p>SIS and bet365 Embrace Lottery Segment Together</p>
<p>SIS makes for a perfect choice, as the company has been able to develop multiple lottery products in the past and is bringing that expertise to Lotto365 to provide players with exclusive live draws and boost bet365’s entire lottery offers in the process.</p>
<p>Lotto365 is drawing a winner every five minutes 23 hours a day. The product is developed, streamed, and maintained by SIS’s dedicated studio in Milton Keynes. Players stand to win up to £100,000 on their £1 bet if the player gets five numbers out of 36 successful.</p>
<p>Lotto365 will launch in English, but it will gradually expand into other languages so that players in different jurisdictions have access to outstanding options. The results of the draws will also be available on the 49s.co.uk website. The partnership was welcomed by executives from both companies. SIS head of product proposition Jessica Mills said:</p>
<p>We are very pleased to be partnering with bet365 to deliver this exciting new project. Our 49’s Product team have worked very hard to support the creation and development of Lotto365. SIS head of product proposition Jessica Mills</p>
<p>Lotto365 Is Testament to SIS’ Product Quality</p>
<p>Mills further hailed the launch of the Lotto365 product, arguing that it’s proof that his company’s reputation and heritage have stood the test of time. The 49’s product portfolio offered by SIS is an outstanding product that will continue to thrive, Mills said.</p>
<p>A bet365 spokesperson also welcome the opportunity to deliver this new experience to players and praised Lotto365 for all that it brings: “It’s a key product for many bettors within the bet365 group, and this new offering will be highly appealing,” bet365 spokesperson.</p>
