<p>Stakelogic Live has expanded its reach in the regulated Belgian iGaming market. The company, which is the live casino offshoot of Stakelogic, a provider of table and slot games for online casinos, has signed a new partnership with Versailles Casino, a prominent local operator.</p>
<p>This will ensure that Stakelogic Live is better represented on the market and give the supplier a strong foothold as it seeks to promote its products and establish them with top-performing brands in the region. The current tie-up focuses on two games, specifically, to name Auto Roulette and Auto Roulette Classic.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Versailles Casino will be able to add variety and quality to its offer, the company informs in a press release shared via email. Stakelogic Live is confident that Belgian players will be able to significantly benefit from these new experiences and make the most of them.</p>
<p>The games are readily available to both mobile and desktop consumers and they are set to truly elevate the experience for all participants. The opportunity was welcomed by Stakelogic Sales Manager Danila Dzehs who was thrilled at the opportunity to see Auto Roulette launched with Versailles Casino.</p>
<p>Dzehs hailed the game as a must-have for any operator and said that it’s important for all iGaming companies to feature the product. It’s a way for operators to take the classic roulette table experience to what Dzehs described as "the next level."</p>
<p>Dzehs further added that Stakelogic is fully committed to shaping up as a regional leader and is determined to continue growing n Europe and beyond. The partnership with Versailles Casino in Belgium is a continuation of this ambition.</p>
<p>Versailles Casino CEO Ludovic Lefevre was similarly excited with the new partnership and said that the deal was a great opportunity for the brand to innovate its platform and add more worthwhile games that can help drive results for the company forward.</p>
<p>Both Auto Roulette and Auto Roulette Classic are able to bring around the type of thrilling content that will no doubt elevate the level of gameplay.</p>
<p>"Our players love live casino which is why we are always looking to add more quality providers to our portfolio," Lefevre said, adding that Stakelogic Live is the type of live casino specialist that will definitely have a strong impact on the casino’s overall performance and success.</p>
<p>Just recently, Stakelogic expanded with BetShop into the Greek iGaming market. The company also took decisive strides in the Dutch and Italian markets last year.</p>
