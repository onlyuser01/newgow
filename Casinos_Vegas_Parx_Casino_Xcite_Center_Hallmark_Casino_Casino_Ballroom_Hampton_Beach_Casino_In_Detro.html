<p>Responsible Wagering Australia, a body representing some of Australia's biggest sports betting companies, including PointsBet, Ladbrokes, and Sportsbet among others, has appointed Kai Cantwell as Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>His appointment follows his previous work as a policy adviser, and he steps into the new position at a time when sports betting regulation is changing across the country. Cantwell’s experience, which spans more than ten years working with various government institutions, will prove invaluable to Responsible Wagering Australia in the coming months, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>
<p>Cantwell has already helped create important pillars of the gambling industry on a national level, including the successful implementation of a national consumer protection framework targeting online gambling. In his new role, Cantwell will seek to advocate for regulated sports betting businesses in the country and help them navigate the intensifying debate surrounding gambling regulation.</p>
<p>He is due to step into the position on April 17. The industry faces unique challenges, Responsible Wagering Australia sources claim cited by the media, and Cantwell is the person who seems to be best prepared to enact changes that will help the gambling industry, which currently generates $2bn in taxes and supports 32,000 jobs, remain sustainable in the long-term and amid intensifying regulatory pressure. The total economic contribution is estimated at $6bn, however.</p>
<p>Among the challenges that Responsible Wagering Australia would have to meet are such issues as point of consumption tax increase, new advertisement rules, and responsible gambling framework changes. There are also several parliamentary hearings that the gambling industry would have to go through.</p>
<p>The appointment was hailed by Responsible Wagering Australia Chairman Nick Minchin who welcomed the arrival of Cantwell, pointing out the unique qualities that make him suitable for the role:</p>
<p>"His deep understanding of social policy, sports, wagering and Government position him perfectly to lead RWA and its members as we continue to promote socially responsible wagering and advocate for the highest standards in the sector."</p>
<p>Cantwell was no less excited to be joining the organizaiton in his new position and seek to bring around positive change across the board. He confirmed that he was excited to be working with Responsible Wagering Australia in this new capacity and with the sporting and racing bodies within it.</p>
<p>Cantwell confirmed that he will seek to enhance the organization’s understanding of responsible gambling through research, data, and insights so that effective measures may be passed to the ultimate benefit of consumers.</p>
