<p>Modestas Bukauskas Resurgence Has Already Started</p>
<p>Born and raised in Lithuania, the Baltic Gladiator started his MMA career in England. After fighting (and winning) four bouts in lower-ranked promotions, he joined Cage Warriors in 2016. Over the next three years, he built himself an impressive portfolio with six wins and two losses (both of which happened at the start of his CW career).</p>
<p>It was 2019 when he became the Cage Warriors Light Heavyweight champion, the title he defended once the same year. Bukauskas vacated the title a year later so that he could join the UFC. He went to America with huge ambitions, which amplified after he demolished his opponent Andreas Michalidis on his debut – for which Bukauskas received the Performance of the Night bonus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s where his UFC success stopped. He went on to lose the next three fights, which led to Dana White &amp; Co. decide not to renew his contract. In his final UFC fight, Bukauskas suffered a leg injury, for which he had to take a year-long hiatus to recover.</p>

<p>Then, on November 4, 2022, he made his comeback. He fought Lee Chadwick at Cage Warriors 145, winning the fight by unanimous decision. It was his 12th career win, as well as the second that happened after the final bell. He also has two wins by submission, as well as eight by knockout.</p>
<p>Punching and kicking are his strongest weapons, which isn’t surprising knowing that he’s got a background in kickboxing. Actually, before becoming a professional MMA fighter, he was a four-time kickboxing champ of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Chuck Campbell Is Another Kickboxing Expert</p>
<p>Campbell is 5-1-1 in his professional MMA career with two wins by KO/TKO and three by decision. His only loss so far happened after the fight went the distance. It was a split decision loss to Tyree Fortune at Bellator 233.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he started his MMA journey as a Bellator fighter but is now looking to get to the Cage Warriors throne. Does he have it in him to get there?</p>
<p>Same as Bukauskas, Campbell too is a kickboxing expert who used to practice this sport for years before switching to MMA. He’s fast, tall, and has a long reach, which makes him hard to hit. However, if there’s a man who can get to him, it’s Bukauskas.</p>
<p>Further, the Team Europe fighter has way more weapons in his arsenal than Campbell. The American just isn’t great on the floor, nor is his takedown defense anything special.</p>
<p>Modestas Bukauskas vs Chuck Campbell Prediction</p>
<p>Campbell might be a decent fighter, but he’s nowhere near Bukauskas’ level. The Baltic Gladiator is a Cage Warriors legend, which is why we feel as if the CW promoters have matched him up with an easier opponent on purpose. It’s not an exaggeration to say that everything in Cage Warriors would love to see Bukauskas reign the Light Heavyweight division once again.</p>
