    <h1>Mrgreen Casino Casino Royale Film Cast Best Casino Biloxi Michigan Casinos Map Bay 101 Casino Swift</h1>

<p>There was a welcome offer of 100% deposit bonus up to £50. I deposited £100 and therefore got £50 bonus funds. I played with my £50 and turned it into a good amount maybe around £2000. Then I completed the 30x WR of the bonus money (£50) which is £1500, by playing slots allowed to be played for the wager. All was good up to here and it said I completed it and everything was ok and transferred the remaining allowance which had been moved from the "bonus balance" to "real money balance" I had £1262 left after wagering the required WR and so I requested a withdrawal and it went through. All photos are attached showing the withdrawal being processed. This happened yesterday.</p>
<p>Today when I check back on the casino, there are no pending transactions and the pending withdrawal disappears. I check back an hour later and I receive an email saying your withdrawal has been declined. I check on the Casino and see that pending withdrawal is not £1262 anymore but £150. I’ve messaged them via their chat and sent them multiple emails but they haven’t responded.</p>
<p>Please can you get them involved I think they just don’t want to pay it out. It’s not fair from them at all.</p>
<p>If you need further information please let me know I will be happy to provide as long as you deal with these scummy casinos.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
