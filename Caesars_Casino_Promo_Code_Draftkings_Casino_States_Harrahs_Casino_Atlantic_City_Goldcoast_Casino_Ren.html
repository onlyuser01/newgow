<p>Push Gaming, a supplier of igaming content for the online gambling industry, has teamed up with Coolbet, a global casino and betting operator with extensive market reach. As a result, Push Gaming will integrate its portfolio of games with the operator and offer players in multiple regions access to some signature-style games developed by Push.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s Titles Become Part of Coolbet</p>
<p>Those include options such as Nightfall, Fat Banker, Big Bamboo, and Jammin’ Jars to name a few. Coolbet’s reach includes established igaming markets such as Estonia, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada. Push Gaming is hoping that this alliance will help the company strengthen its presence in leading European and North American gaming markets.</p>
<p>Push Gaming is also deploying its dedicated RGS platform to further bolster Coolbet’s gaming capabilities. Push will introduce its games with all local players opting for the Coolbet brand and offer them tailored solutions fully-optimized for the needs of each individual market. Commenting on this partnership, Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey said:</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure to partner with Coolbet, this deal comes at an exciting time as we continue to work on providing the industry with our most varied and high-quality releases to date.” Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey</p>
<p>Coolbet is praised as a strong option for Push Gaming, citing the operator’s roots in the Latin American and Canadian markets. This, Hickey says, should provide Push Gaming with an entry into new and highly-desirable market options.</p>
<p>New and Appreciated Opportunities for Both Companies</p>
<p>Coolbet head of casino and games Patrik Backlund has been equally excited at the opportunity to expand the operator’s existing lineup of games and products through the Push Gaming deal. He added:</p>
<p>“Push’s vast portfolio of fan-favorite titles will both engage and excite our players and we look forward to seeing the reception its extensive slot offering will receive.” Coolbet head of casino and games Patrik Backlund</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s products have already been introduced to a number of prominent brands across Europe, including Entain, 32Red, LeoVegas, Casumo, Betsson, Svenska Spel, and numerous others. Push Gaming previously revealed a partnership with NetBet, with the companies focusing on strengthening their European footprint through this alliance.</p>
