<p>Benfica Is (Almost) Impossible to Beat in Lisbon</p>
<p>After beating Club Brugge 2-0 on the road, Benfica now just need not to lose heavily on Tuesday and they’ll book the ticket to the quarterfinal of the Champions League. But the chances they will lose look slim. It’s because the game is played on their turf, Estadio da Luz in the capital of Portugal.</p>
<p>At home, Benfica are without a loss in competitive games since May 2022. Further, during that period, we saw them draw just two games. One was a 1-1 draw with the French heavyweights PSG in October. The other one was a 2-2 draw with Sporting CP, another Portuguese side competing in Europe (UEFA Europa League) this season.</p>
<p>They do have some injury problems right now, but the thing about Benfica is that this team has a very long bench.</p>
<p>Club Brugge Got Nothing to Lose</p>
<p>Reaching the 2022-23 Champions League Round of 16 is already a huge achievement for Club Brugge. In fact, it’s the furthest they’ve ever gone in this competition. Obviously, they would love to get to the quarterfinal, but for that, they need to score at least two goals in Portugal.</p>
<p>The reason why this should worry them is that they haven’t been in much of a goal-scoring mood lately. For instance, the last time they scored more than two goals in a game was in October 2022.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that they scored over 2.5 goals only once in the Champions League. It happened last September when they beat Porto 4-0 in Portugal.</p>
<p>Benfica vs Club Brugge Prediction</p>
<p>Club Brugge have no other option but to attack with all they got on Tuesday. Sure, they might score, but this sort of strategy will make room for Benfica’s counterattacks. As a result, we should see a very exciting game, probably with a lot of goals on both ends. Nevertheless, given how good Benfica’s players have been at home, it’s only logical to assume they’re going to win again.</p>
<p>Pick: Benfica to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
