    <h1>Myrtle Beach Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Hotels Best Western Plus Casino Royale Isle Of Capri Casino Hot</h1>

<p>BETER continues to build up across the entire realm of the iGaming and betting experience, with the company forging a new pivotal alliance with content distribution platform SoftGamings. Thanks to this new partnership, SoftGamings will be able to provide partner operators with a list of BETER Live casino games, which is what the partnership covers exclusively.</p>
<p>BETER has been able to deliver cutting-edge casino, esports, and sports betting experiences, and the company is now doubling down on its growth in the live casino vertical.</p>
<p>As a result, Soft2Gamings operators will have access to a number of titles, including the latest release, Gravity Blackjack, Sic Bo, Andar Bahar, and not least Baccarat. All of these games are powered and developed internally by BETER Live and they are set up to allow players to have the best possible experience.</p>
<p>BETER Live stands to benefit from the alliance because it’s another opportunity for the company to launch with new audiences and expand its clout in the iGaming sector, even though it faces stiff competition in the live casino vertical. Commenting on the opportunity, though, BETER Live Director Anna Vikmane was more than happy.</p>
<p>"I am very excited to start working with SoftGamings," Vikmane assured. She added that partner operators will be able to benefit from the finest titles available on BETER Live’s library and argued that it will undoubtedly help strengthen and raise awareness for the live casino portfolio that the company has been working so hard to develop and promote.</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by BETER CRO Yori Arami who said that BETER and SoftGamings had a lot in common and that they both shared the same ideal and outlook for the iGaming industry. Partnering with a gaming aggregator such as SoftGamings, explained Arami, would undoubtedly help boost the live casino’s reach.</p>
<p>Not least, there was SoftGamings Head of Partnerships Anna Lalina who added that the company was very happy to be teaming up with BETER Live just as well and that the aggregator and its team were looking forward to the myriad opportunities that the two companies would be able to explore together.</p>
<p>BETER recently signed a partnership with another content aggregator, WeAreCasino. The company also signed another prominent partnership with Bayes Esports and its BODEX platform, expanding further in the esports vertical.</p>
