<p>B2B betting content and production services provider Sports Information Services has inked a deal with the Polish bookmaker Betfan that has seen the latter adopt the SIS Competitive Gaming esports solution.</p>
<p>Betfan Implements SIS Competitive Gaming</p>
<p>As per the agreement, SIS will supply live stream commentary, data, and imagery with betting triggers for Betfan’s platform. Moreover, SIS will provide top betting prices for more than 40,000 annual live sports events.</p>
<p>The Polish gambling operator’s managing director, Grzegorz Kiczko, spoke on the deal and revealed that Betfan’s team is thrilled to add SIS Competitive Gaming to its offering. Kiczko mentioned that the considerable growth in popularity of esports and esports betting only adds to the value of this deal.</p>
<p>Kiczko added that the launch has been a great success and SIS Competitive Gaming is already driving engagement from Betfan’s pre-existing customers and also attracting new bettors to the platform. According to the managing director, the operator has seen an almost immediate increase in revenues.</p>
<p>The Immediate Success Attests to SIS’ Dedication to Quality</p>
<p>Sports Information Services is just as excited by the partnership’s quick success. The company’s digital sales manager, Anze Gantar, spoke on the matter. He mentioned that SIS is delighted to have launched SIS Competitive Gaming with Betfan. According to Gantar, this partnership is a “testament to the relatively high margin esports products SIS can offer to operators, who are eager to boost their sportsbook offering with profitable esports events.”</p>
<p>Gantar continued by elaborating that SIS Competitive Gaming is designed to appeal to existing sports bettors by providing them with a format that is familiar but also boosts their engagement.</p>
<p>“From the initial success we’ve seen, it’s clear that Betfan’s customers are really engaging with the fast-paced action that allows for multiple betting opportunities,” Gantar pointed out.</p>
<p>The SIS Competitive Gaming solution has proven its worth on the market and has been integrated by several of SIS’ partners. Seeing the success of its esports content, SIS has been working to keep up with the high demand while still ensuring high standards.</p>
<p>SIS has had an eventful year as it managed to grow its business through various partnerships with operators across the world. At the beginning of October, the B2B supplier improved its relations with Australia-based racing-oriented sportsbook data provider RACELAB GLOBAL thanks to its high investment in the firm. SIS managed to launch a subsidiary in the United States, improving its global reach. The company also penned a deal with Marshalls, boosting its influence in South Africa.</p>
