<p>Scientific Games’ position in the lottery industry has been unassailable with the company coming through time and again. The latest consolidation move comes with Scientific Games’ decision to deploy its Wave point-of-sale technology throughout the Atlantic Lottery’s retail network giving local players and as many as 3,000 locations access to an advanced lottery experience.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Boosts Atlantic Lottery Retail Offer</p>
<p>The Atlantic Lottery already operates in several provinces, including Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Labrador and Newfoundland, and will now be targeted by the new technology rollout. The Atlantic Lottery has embarked on an ambitious project to quickly catch up with its operations and modernize its offering, bringing players some of the best possible options available to players.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest deal, VP of channels for Atlantic Lottery Joey Cormier said that the company was excited to introduce this new tech, hailing it as an important evolution for the organization:</p>
<p>We are delighted to have advanced terminals for our retailers, and we are aligning with rapidly moving modernization trends taking place at retail. VP of channels for Atlantic Lottery Joey Cormier</p>
<p>Scientific Games also makes a perfect partner to build upon the existing technological offer, as the company has been a trusted partner to the lottery for many years now. A modular central gaming system by Scientific Games was introduced back in 2017 and the pair have been building up rapidly.</p>
<p>Scientific Games further offers the lottery a digital lottery system and player subscription services, along with the Scratch ‘N Win games. The new terminals deployed by Scientific Games will further make the retail customer experience easier and more rewarding while adjusting the cabinets to the needs of the particular retail environments, the press release noted.</p>
<p>Ensuring the Longevity and Sustainability of the Lottery</p>
<p>Scientific Games was equally thrilled to welcome this new partnership and opportunity. SG president of Americas &amp; global instant products, John Schulz, said that advanced retail point-of-sale technology is now crucial as workforce challenges and consumer convenience are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>“We will see retail technology, including self-service, have an increasingly important role in driving lottery performance,” Schulz noted. According to him, the new technology deployed will help boost the lottery’s ability to adapt to changing demands and customer preferences, making sure that The Atlantic Lottery remains relevant, sustainable and on a path to robust growth.</p>
