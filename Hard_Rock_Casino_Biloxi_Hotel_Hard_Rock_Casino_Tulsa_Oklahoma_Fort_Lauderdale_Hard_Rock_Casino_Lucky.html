    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Biloxi Hotel Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Fort Lauderdale Hard Rock Casino Lucky</h1>

<p>Salsa Technology has announced a new step forward in the Brazilian iGaming market. The company has expanded its third-party content reach by tying the knot with Weebet, a Brazilian iGaming company specializing in stats and the development of sports software.</p>
<p>Weebet also powers a range of online casino brands, which will now enable Salsa Gator, the aggregation solution by Salsa Technology, to introduce its library of games to websites powered by the Brazilian company. This means that a number of prominent brands will benefit from Salsa’s content and product offering.</p>
<p>Among those are prominent names such as Betei.bet, Alfasports.net, and Mjsports.com, the company informed in a press release. Salsa will introduce a range of solutions along, including its Video Bingo games, which include prominent titles such as Halloween Groove and Jogo dos Bichos Praia, which have been adapted for the needs of local player bases.</p>
<p>Salsa Gator proves a powerful solution that combines products by more than 70 third-party suppliers, including brands such as Betsoft, 7Mojos, Habanero, and others. Welcoming the news, Salsa Technology head of Marketing &amp; Sales Eliane Nunes argued that Weebet shares the same core principles as Salsa Technology.</p>
<p>The localized content offered by Salsa Technology and its Salsa Gator solution will strike home with Weebet casinos and their audiences, and help further expand market reach, boosting the overall operational footprint.</p>
<p>Weebet CEO Lenildo Nogueira was equally pleased with the opportunity to work with Salsa Technology. He called the partnership a privilege and said that there are distinct and multiple synergies to speak of when considering the partnership.</p>
<p>The fact Salsa is joining, Nogueira explained, would give the company’s business in Latin America a significant boost and benefits. Salsa Technology, in the meantime, has been working on strengthening its core team. The company appointed André Filipe Neves as its new Chief Operating Officer last year.</p>
