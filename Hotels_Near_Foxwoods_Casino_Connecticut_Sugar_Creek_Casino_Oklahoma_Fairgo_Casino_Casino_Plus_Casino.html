<p>The GamblingNews Awards are back yet another month, with AvatarUX’s ReefPop grabbing headlines as the Best New Slot for March</p>
<p>The GamblingNews team has screened and reviewed dozens of slots in March with the help of Casinolytics data to conclude that AvatarUX’s under-the-sea-themed game was the hottest new take in the vertical. ReefPop is an innovative game featuring AvatarUX’s signature PopWins mechanic.</p>
<p>Commenting on the occasion of the award, AvatarUX CEO Nicola Longmuir hailed the achievement and said it was indicative of the hard work that has gone into making ReefPop, and AvatarUX’s games in general, player-favorite, and distinct options:</p>
<p>“Thank you GamblingNews for the award for Best New Slot of the Month. It’s fantastic to see a boutique studio in the industry, such as ourselves, being recognized for truly breaking the mold in casino game development. The award is testament to all the hard work from our very dedicated team at AvatarUX and we look forward to launching ReefPop and the rest of our exceptional portfolio in new markets including North America in the coming months.” AvatarUX CEO Nicola Longmuir</p>
<p>The game offers high variance and a win potential of x10000 the player stake, along with a 96% average RTP. Released on March 10, and compatible with a variety of platforms and browsers, the game offers 262,144 ways to win.</p>
<p>ReefPop will see players become a part of a war that has a plucky army of fish caught on the one side against an invading throng of crabs on the other. The slot is marked by a fast pace of play and allows players to enjoy the PopWinsä feature, which makes it so that every time you win, the reels expand, and increase your chances of securing another winning combination.</p>
<p>The game comes with Unlimited Free Spins, which means that every time you win during a free spin round, the clock resets and you start fresh. ReefPop also comes with a special Golden Shark symbol which is multiplied by the number of the other Golden Shark symbols to produce some excellent value. The multipliers are a lot of fun and so are the free spins feature which are set to 3.</p>
<p>To make things even better, AvatarUX’s ReefPop features a Gambling Wheel, which will add more opportunities to win. Players may gamble their Free Spins, which could lead to greater multipliers as well. There is a lot going on under the sea’s surface in ReefPop by AvatarUX.</p>
