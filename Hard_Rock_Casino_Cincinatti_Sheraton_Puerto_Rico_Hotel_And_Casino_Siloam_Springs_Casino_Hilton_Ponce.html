    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Cincinatti Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel And Casino Siloam Springs Casino Hilton Ponce</h1>

<p>Hi Veronika,</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Payment Method (WPM)</p>
<p>The only and also my preferable WPM which worked in the past was NaudaPay. (see attachments)</p>
<p>Since I have had problems with 0X. bet before and thanks to your intervention 0X.bet finally paid me</p>
<p>15 K in July. As you can see in the statements, finally some succeeded in the months after.</p>
<p>Assistance from Customer Support</p>
<p>The most suitable payment method is NaudaPay. But without any explanation, they started refunding all my withdrawals. So I complained about that and asked 0X.bet why this happened. Then the VIP manager said I had to try a different method like Astro Pay. I protested but finally made an account at Astro Pay. Before I could use this WPM I had to make a deposit first. So I deposited a minimum of Eu 20. After that, I tried to make a withdrawal through AstroPay but they let me wager again for Eu 400!!! I said that was unfair as I was trying to cash out 10K for over 6 weeks at that moment. But of course, there was no help on that and I lost Eu 400,- so my balance was Eu 9620. But after losing it should have been possible to withdraw through AstroPay, but guess what? They removed the WPM AstroPay button from my display (see attachment) . After this happened I complained about this and they said there was an issue because of the Curacao government. It looked like they were fooling me of course. All trust was gone. Then the VIP manager said I had to make an eZeeWallet account as this besides the Bitcoin option, was this the only WPM left. I had to make a deposit again, so I made an account at eZeeWallet. Strange was that the deposit through eZeeWallet was directly from my bank instead of my eZeeWallet balance !! That should not be possible and I think eZeeWallet is a Casbit corp or something. Strange thinks happen over there. Eventually, I didn't want to start with eZeeWallet as the Trustpilot reviews are horrible with the same issues under customers who want their money back. I also found out that any withdrawal from eZeeWallet to your bank account costs you 2% with a minimum of Eu 10,-!!! So Eu 9600,- would cost me Eu 192,- !! I have tried to withdraw Eu 100,- , but I am still waiting what happens.</p>
<p>Today I noticed that a payout of Eu 100,- succeeded through NaudaPay!! But I cannot find out which withdrawal was paid out. As something went okay, I have directly made new withdrawals through NaudaPay with a total of 9,6K. There are also new WPMs now available VISA and Mastercard.</p>
<p>Please let me know everything is clear and that all attachments are readable as I can't see them.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>
