    <h1>Potawatomi Casino Hotel Galaxy World Casino Online Games Casino Aria Vegas Casino Casino Bus Trips N</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have to file a complaint here again.</p>
<p>Because of the actually good reviews I had registered at the megaslot casino. To be on the safe side, I verified myself with my identity card and a bank statement, and the documents were approved straight away. Deposited 80 euros and wanted to withdraw 101 euros. A small win. Now I had uploaded two screenshots from my Skrill account as I had done at another N1 Casino and there were no problems. So long story short: My payout was rejected on the grounds that the e-mail address at Skrill was different from the one I used to register at megaslot. Got a huge shock because I've never had problems with it in an online casino. I also deposited via Skrill, at the latest there should have been a hint. Well, I used to have another DSL provider and left this email with Skrill. After a lot of back and forth chatting, megaslot Casino is now giving me huge trouble, even though I've uploaded all the requested Skrill documents and you can see that it's my account. Now the status is that they are telling me that all the documents are there, but that they are having trouble withdrawing my money because it is a different email address than the one I have at the casino. You would have to check something now and I should be patient. So very strange for me. Now where is the problem supposed to be? As I said, I have never had any problems at other casinos with the fact that I now use a different e-mail at Skrill than the one I use to register at the casino. If I had known that now I would of course have changed my Skrillmail already. Can you tell me something or help me get my money? I took pictures of the chat process again and sent an email today and told the casino that I found this very dubious. Do not think that I get my money because of their behavioral tactics.</p>
<p>Many greetings</p>
<p>Annette</p>
