<p>The Miami Dolphins are welcoming the New England Patriots at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens in Week 1 of the 2022 NFL. The game is played on Sunday, September 11 at 1:00 p.m. local time. The hosts are seen as odds-on favorites in the eyes of the bookmakers, who expect them to get their fourth straight win over this opponent.</p>
<p>Are oddsmakers right to think of Miami as the betting favorite? That’s the question we’re going to try to answer in our Patriots vs Dolphins preview.</p>

<p>Can Bill Belichick Outsmart the Opposition?</p>
<p>One may argue that in 2022, the Dolphins are a team that has more superstars on the roster than the Patriots. If you compare the two teams player-by-player, you’ll probably get to the conclusion that the Dolphins are (slightly) better.</p>
<p>However, the Patriots do have a better coach. Bill Belichick is the man in question, a 70-year-old who has won eight Super Bowls with the Pats. All of those Lombardi Trophy wins came with Tom Brady in the quarterback position. However, since his departure to Tampa, Belichick has been more focused on the defense.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn’t mean the Pats’ new QB isn’t good. Mac Jones is coming off an impressive rookie season. Still, we don’t think he’s going to be in the spotlight in Week 1. Instead, the Pats’ defense players are the ones who hold the key to beating the Dolphins.</p>
<p>The thing is that Miami has a new coach, who previously worked as an offensive assistant. The man in question is 39-year-old Mike McDaniel who replaced defensive-minded Brian Flores. Knowing this, it’s only logical to assume that the Dolphins are going to put a lot of emphasis on their offense in 2022.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins Have High Hopes for 2022 Season</p>
<p>Last season, the Dolphins went 9-8, which wasn’t enough to get them to the postseason. It’s been six years since they made the playoffs last time, but we could see them pull it off in 2022. The thing is that Miami’s key players are no longer young and experienced, the best example being their quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
<p>Drafted in 2020 as a potential new NFL superstar, the Hawaiian is ready to take his career to the next level in his third year with the Dolphins. Luckily for him, he’ll have a wide receiver to help him achieve his goal.</p>
<p>The man in question is Tyreek Hill, a former receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs. Nicknamed Cheetah, Hill is famous for his speed, which seems to be exactly what Miami’s offense needs.</p>
<p>New England Patriots vs Miami Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>Miami’s strongest weapon in 2022 is their offense. However, we believe that Belichick’s boys have what it takes to handle them. The last time they played against the Dolphins, they conceded 33 points, but we think they’re going to do better this time. And their good defensive game should be enough to bring them a victory.</p>
<p>Picks: New England Patriots to win; under 41 points</p>
