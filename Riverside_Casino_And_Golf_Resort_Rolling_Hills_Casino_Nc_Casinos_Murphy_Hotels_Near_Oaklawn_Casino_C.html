    <h1>Riverside Casino And Golf Resort Rolling Hills Casino Nc Casinos Murphy Hotels Near Oaklawn Casino C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I will address your questions and hopefully, the case will be clarified.</p>
<p>The player can change Astropay withdrawal details for future payouts, however, since the transaction has been processed it cannot be changed for this specific withdrawal. Imagine if you send a bank transfer, if the transfer was completed there is no way to change the recipient's bank account. The recipient will then be the bank account that you originally selected.</p>
<p>In this case, the system could verify the same method was used for the withdrawal (AstroPay), and the withdrawal was processed to the account the user selected upon requesting the withdrawal. Kindly note that as per the terms and conditions on our site, the user shall only use financial instruments that are valid and lawfully belong to them.</p>
<p>I understand the customer is confirming they have used a method that does not belong to them, in which case, the account will be put under review as per standard procedure, as this is a breach of the terms. We can only assume it was the user's intention to withdraw to this specific account.</p>
<p>I would like to again mention that since the transaction was completed, we cannot reclaim the funds. Once the withdrawal is paid out, the funds are held in the customer's account.</p>
<p>We trust that with your experience you will understand this process.</p>
