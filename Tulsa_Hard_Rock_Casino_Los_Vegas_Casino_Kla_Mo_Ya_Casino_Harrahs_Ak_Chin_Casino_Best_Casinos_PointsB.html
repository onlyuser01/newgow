<p>In a first of its kind agreement, betting firm PointsBet has landed a partnership deal with the University of Colorado and their NCAA franchise, the Colorado Buffaloes.</p>
<p>PointsBet Signs Landmark Deal with University of Colorado</p>
<p>PointsBet has landed a five-year partnership with The University of Colorado, the home institution for the NCAA franchise the Colorado Buffaloes, marking a ground-breaking agreement between a sportsbook and an educational institution. PointsBet is similarly the first operator in the United States to have struck a partnership with a Power Five Conference collegiate sports team.</p>
<p>As per the agreement, PointsBet’s brand name will appear in Folsom Field, the Buffaloes home arena and PointsBet signage will also be inscribed into the basketball and volleyball stadiums at the CU Events Centers.</p>
<p>Similar to promotions between major sports leagues and sports betting firms, PointsBet will be part of original online activations, game day promotions, and television and radio broadcast marketing efforts.</p>
<p>PointsBet is cleverly exploring a new angle to broaden its audience and pique the interest of youngsters. While the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is averse to gambling partnerships during main competitions, such as March Madness, there is no rule that explicitly forbids advertising during conferences.</p>
<p>Conferences are independent. For example, the NCAA announced earlier this year that it would consider not holding collegiate sports events until after the COVID-19 pandemic has been dealt with.</p>
<p>However, conferences are still underway, although not everyone has taken part, and the Big Ten and Pac-12 have decided not to hold the regular season. The University, though, has had no trouble with signing a partnership with a gaming firm.</p>
<p>According to the University of Colorado, the signage was a good opportunity to reduce some of the stress put on athletic departments due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>A Chance to Help Beleagured Athletics Departments</p>
<p>PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken said that the deal was another step towards PointsBet’s expansion as a recognizable name on the US sports betting market. He further added:</p>
<p>“As a tech company at heart that is proud to call the state of Colorado home, we are thrilled to announce this partnership as part of our ongoing quest to become synonymous with Colorado sports betting.”</p>
<p>Aitken further noted that it was an honor to partner with the Colorado Buffaloes and that the company was committed to boosting both sports betting knowledge, but more importantly, boosting responsible gambling awareness, both essential to a long-term success.</p>
<p>University of Colorado head of athletics, Rick George, was similarly pleased with the decision to bring PointsBet on board and help the department through the difficult patch. He had this to add:</p>
<p>“We are impressed with their commitment to raising awareness around responsible gaming. And we’re particularly excited whenever we can partner with sponsors who call Colorado home.”</p>
<p>PointsBet already has a string of important partnerships as well. The company signed an important deal with NBA’s Denver Nuggets’ parent company, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment. The sportsbook is also sponsoring NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and Colorado Mammoth, an NFL franchise. Last but not least, PointsBet is also a partner to the Major League Soccer team, Colorado Rapids.</p>
<p>PointsBet has been one of the most proactive gambling firms as well. The company has active partnerships with the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Tigers.</p>
