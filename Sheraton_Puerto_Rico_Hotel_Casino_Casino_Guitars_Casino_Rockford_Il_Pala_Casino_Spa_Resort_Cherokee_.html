<p>Taco Bell World Series Stolen Base Promo Returns, MGM Joins Party With Limited Live Money Betting Offering</p>

<p>Taco Bell is bringing back its “Steal a Base, Steal a Taco” promotion for the 2019 World Series, and this year, MGM Resorts International is joining the effort by offering a corresponding, real money wagering program in three states.</p>

<p>“Steal a Base, Steal a Taco,” which is in its seventh year, rewards participants that are registered on Taco Bell’s website or mobile app with a free Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco after the first thievery of a base in a World Series game. The normal price of that particular taco is $1.49, according to Fast Food Menu Prices.</p>
<p>This year, MGM will offer bettors at its retail sportsbooks in Mississippi, Nevada and New Jersey, as well as online gamblers in NJ, a chance to wager real capital on what player they think will steal the first base in the World Series.</p>
<p>BetMGM will post prop bets on October 14, before the end of the League Championship Series, offering a list of active players from the four remaining playoff teams,” according to a statement. “BetMGM oddsmakers will use historical data and their odds-making process to post real odds, which will be updated as the Postseason progresses.”</p>
<p>The World Series is scheduled to start on Oct. 22.</p>
<p>Wait Could Be Brief</p>
<p>Fans hungry for a free taco and bettors awaiting the results of their wagers may not have to wait long, because of the remaining four playoff teams, at least two are somewhat prolific pilferers of bases. The St. Louis Cardinals and the Washington Nationals, the teams competing in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), each stole 116 bases during the 2019 regular season, according to Baseball Reference data.</p>
<p>The Nationals lead that best-of-seven series 2-0. Base thievery dips among the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees, the teams vying for the American League championship. The Astros and the Yankees stole just 67 and 55 bases, respectively, during the regular season.</p>
<p>Neither team has a player that ranked among the top 10 in stolen bases in the American League this year. In the National League, Trea Turner and Victor Robles of the Nationals, and Kolten Wong of the Cardinals were among the top 10 in swiped bases during the regular season.</p>
<p>Another Restaurant Deal</p>
<p>The partnership with Taco Bell is MGM’s second restaurant deal in as many months. In September, the largest operator on the Las Vegas Strip said it was joining forces with sports bar giant Buffalo Wild Wings to bring digital wagering options to that company’s locations throughout the US.</p>
<p>The initial concept in the MGM/Buffalo Wild Wings association is a free predicative football game known as “Picks and Props.” That deal could expand as more states where the two companies operate permit sports betting.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the agreement with California-based Taco Bell weren’t disclosed. The fast-food chain is a unit of YUM Brands, Inc., which also owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains.</p>
