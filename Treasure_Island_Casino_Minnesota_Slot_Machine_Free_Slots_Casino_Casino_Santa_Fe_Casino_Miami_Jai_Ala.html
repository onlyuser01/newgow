<p>The city's tourism and economic growth plan will be boosted by the grant from the Massachusetts Gaming Mitigation Fund, a new report suggests</p>
<p>Legal land-based gambling as well as sports wagering activities help raise tax revenue for states that offer such options. While there are always supporters and opponents of legal gambling, one major benefit of the activity is precisely the tax revenue and the fact that legal gambling helps reduce the share of the black market. Still, land-based casinos can bring much more benefits than tax revenue, considering that such locations can provide economic stimulus for counties or cities.</p>
<p>Now, as reported by The Republican, a new grant will help boost the tourism profile and stimulate the economic profile of Holyoke, Massachusetts. In 2019, the city secured a $200,000 grant that contributed toward its tourism plan, providing much-needed support. The current growth plan for tourism in Holyoke seeks to boost visitation to the city for certain events.</p>
<p>Per the plan, a shuttle will help transport MGM Springfield casino visitors to the city, allowing them to enjoy different annual events. This, in turn, is expected to have a positive effect on the overall visitation of Holyoke and see local businesses grow further.</p>
<p>To engage with its plan, the city secured a $200,000 grant from the Massachusetts Gaming Mitigation Fund. Securing the grant was contingent on acceptance from the City Council. Greenlight about the state grant came Tuesday, allowing the city to progress with its ambitious tourism and economic stimulus plan.</p>
<p>The Grant Is Expected to Have Long-Term Impact</p>
<p>Aaron Vega, the director of Holyoke’s Office of Planning and Economic Development, acknowledged the importance of the new $200,000 grant for the city. He explained: “We’re going to capitalize on the fact that more people are coming to Western Massachusetts due to the casino.” Moreover, he pointed to the city’s potential in offering a wide variety of food options saying: “One of our big focuses is cultural diversity, especially when it comes to our restaurants.”</p>
<p>According to Vega, the funding won’t benefit only short-term initiatives but play a key role in long-term processes. Ultimately, the city’s plan will seek to make it more appealing, attracting tourism and investment as well. He spoke about the different areas that will benefit from the funding saying that the city’s website, Explore Holyoke, will benefit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Vega noted that the grant will fuel different historic tourism initiatives, that are expected to attract new visitors and guests. Different art projects would also receive a boost from the latest grant from the Massachusetts Gaming Mitigation Fund.</p>
