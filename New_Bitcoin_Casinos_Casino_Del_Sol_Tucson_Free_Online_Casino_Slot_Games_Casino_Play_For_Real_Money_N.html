    <h1>New Bitcoin Casinos Casino Del Sol Tucson Free Online Casino Slot Games Casino Play For Real Money N</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern.</p>
<p>I came to you when I needed your help once before, you helped resolve the issue for me, I am hoping you can resolve this major issue for me again. I am a VIP customer since september 2018 at jokaroom casino. I have been a loyal, consistent member that has deposited over 100 thousand of raw money. I have invested 2 years to build up my VIP status and trust with this casino and now it's saying they are no longer in operation. I spoke with my vip host yesterday during my cashback, he said nothing, i spoke with customer service about the casino being up for maintenance for 45 minutes (being lied to) now it has been 20 hours and it still states "joka room casino is no longer in operation. I tried to contact the email given on this message and no reply. I also did my own research as the sister site of this casino, pokiepops has also shut down. Ironically I also found out the same management and owners have opened a new casino named "KING Jonnie". Now as you can imagine, I have had 2 years with this casino deposited over 100 thousand dollars, became an elite VIP member, had agreements with management and then all of a sudden, everything is gone. Something is very suspicious here and I am hoping you can help me resolve this, I want one of two things, either I want to be paid a lump sum that is reasonable, for destroying all the hard work and time ive invested to become such an elite VIP all the money ive given this casino for them to just breach their own contract by shutting down without notice or they can find a way to carry over my VIP status at their new casino where they are the same management. I hope to hear back from you soon as this is a very stressful time for me as I really did not deserve such treatment and lies.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards</p>
<p>Troy</p>
