<p>The new agreement with RSI is in line with Delaware’s visionary approach when it comes to online gaming</p>
<p>The Delaware Lottery announced the launch of its first online sportsbook in addition to relaunching its three online casinos. The new move completes the lottery’s transition to Rush Street Interactive’s BetRivers brand.</p>
<p>The recent transition ended 888’s 10-year tenure as the Delaware Lottery’s partner, resulting in a new age for iGaming in the state. The three online casinos in the state, namely Delaware Park, Bally’s Dover Casino and Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino, have thus been updated with many new games.</p>
<p>Eligible consumers across the state can access the three online casinos on their phones, mobile devices and computers and try out what the renewed BetRivers-powered sites have to offer. For reference, the Delaware Park and Harrington Casino &amp; Raceway sites can be accessed by BetRivers’ multi-state application. Fans can also engage with the BetRivers sportsbook and place bets on a variety of professional and collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, RSI will power the Delaware Lottery’s gaming offerings for 5 years. This period can potentially be extended by the lottery operator.</p>
<p>The new agreement with RSI is in line with Delaware’s visionary approach when it comes to online gaming. Delaware was the first state to launch online casino gambling in 2013 and remains one of the few states where iGaming is regulated to this day.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Excited to Join Forces</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s chief executive officer, Richard Schwartz, commented on the “historic and much-anticipated launch,” saying that his team is thrilled to bring its award-winning product to the First State.</p>
<p>With our extensive offering of gaming content, wide range of deposit and withdrawal methods, real-time cash-out approvals, and best-in-class customer service, Delaware customers are going to love the convenience of wagering on their favorite sports, slots, and table games from anywhere in the state. Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>Schwartz added that his team is “honored” to collaborate with the Delaware Lottery and said that the deal is a testament to RSI’s success.</p>
<p>Helene Keeley, the Delaware Lottery director, also commented on the launch, saying that RSI is a perfect fit for the lottery. She praised RSI for its successes in other jurisdictions, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey and lauded its commitment to responsible gaming, quality products, breadth of gaming content and customer service.</p>
<p>We have no doubt that Delawareans will enjoy the ability to play their favorite slot titles on their mobile phones, as well as back their favorite teams. Together RSI and the Delaware Lottery are devoted to successfully delivering best-in-class products and services to our customers. Helene Keeley, director, Delaware Lottery</p>
<p>In other news, the transition to RSI caused a temporary online poker blackout a few days ago.</p>
