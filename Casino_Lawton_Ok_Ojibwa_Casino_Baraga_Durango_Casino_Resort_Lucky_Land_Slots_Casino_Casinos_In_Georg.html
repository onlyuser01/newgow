<p>Miami Dolphins (#7) vs Buffalo Bills (#2) is Sunday’s first Wild Card game. It’s taking place at Highmark Stadium where the Bills are 6-0 against the Dolphins since 2016</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills went 13-3 in the regular season. They finished just behind the Kansas City Chiefs, thus failing to get a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Nevertheless, they should be happy with the challenge they have in the Wild Card Playoffs. This Sunday, they’re playing on their turf against an opponent that’s 1-5 since November.</p>
<p>They should have an easy job, right? To learn whether an upset might happen, make sure to read our Dolphins vs Bills Wild Card preview!</p>

<p>Injury-Plagued Dolphins Praying for a Miracle</p>
<p>Miami’s starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has been out since Week 16 with a concussion. It’s still unclear whether he could return in the Wild Card round, but we honestly doubt it. Still, even with him in the role of the signal-caller, the Dolphins’ passing game might not be too great.</p>
<p>On ESPN just now, @AdamSchefter said he thinks Miami is hoping Tua Tagovailoa will be able to start Sunday against the Bills. They want to see how he progresses this week. — Tyler Dunne (@TyDunne) January 9, 2023</p>
<p>The thing is that with Tua missing several weeks of training, he probably won’t be in top shape on Sunday. As if that wasn’t enough of a problem, the Dolphins also have some issues on the receiving end. The Pro-Bowler WR who’s recorded 1,710 receiving yards and eight touchdowns (7 receiving TDs and one rushing TD) this season, is struggling with an ankle injury.</p>
<p>Although he’s likely to play, he probably won’t be at his best. Unfortunately for the Dolphins, it’s a similar situation when it comes to their second-best WR Jaylen Waddle who’s carrying a shoulder injury.</p>
<p>A Seemingly Easy Job for the Buffalo Bills</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are brilliant on their turf. They finished the regular season with a 7-1 record at Highmark Stadium, with their only loss happening to the Minnesota Vikings in overtime.</p>
<p>They also have a fantastic record against the Dolphins, especially in the games played in upstate New York. In fact, they’re 6-0 at home in the last six Dolphins at Bills duels. One of those wins happened in Round 15 when they beat Miami 32-29.</p>
<p>It was a close game – certainly more intense than what most people had expected – but the Bills still managed to do well in crucial moments of the game.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The last time these two played, Tagovailoa went 17/30 for 234 yards and two TDs which were scored by Hill and Waddle. And even that wasn’t enough for the Dolphins to win.</p>
<p>This time, all three aforementioned players are struggling with fitness, and we just can’t expect to see them play at the same level as in Week 15. Instead, the Bills are going to steamroll them on Sunday, covering the spread with ease.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
