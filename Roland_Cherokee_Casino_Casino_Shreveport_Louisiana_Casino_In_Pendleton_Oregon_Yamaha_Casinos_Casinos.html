    <h1>Roland Cherokee Casino Casino Shreveport Louisiana Casino In Pendleton Oregon Yamaha Casinos Casinos</h1>

<p>Dear Shruthi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please specify how many days ago was your withdrawal requested and which payment method you have opted for? Is there any supporting evidence such as a screenshot of your requested withdrawal? If yes, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Additionally, could you please confirm that the disputed amount is correct?</p>
<p>It’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account, especially wire transfers. That’s why we advise players to be patient and wait at least 14 days after requesting their withdrawals before they submit a complaint. Assuming that you have completed KYC verification successfully and had your withdrawals approved, I truly believe it’s only a matter of time before you’ll receive them. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
