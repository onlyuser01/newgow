<p>Betting company Betway and PSG.LGD’s Dota 2 continue to collaborate in esports as the companies have renewed their partnership.</p>
<p>Betway and PSG.LGD Extend Partnership in Esports</p>
<p>Betway and PSG.LGD continue to build on a successful relationship with the sportsbook now joining PSG as an official betting partner. PSG.LGD’s sizable presence in esports has driven strong support for the club from soccer and gaming fans, with the franchise seeking new ways of engaging with crowds.</p>
<p>Betway, a sportsbook with deep ties in the esports segment, is a natural pick for PSG. Betway operations and marketing director Paul Adkins was happy to extend the company’s partnership with PSG.LGD’s high-performing Dota 2 team.</p>
<p>This comes at an important time for PSG as the team is battling at the Singapore Major, the first Dota Pro Circuit event leading up to The International later this year. The team has reached the Group Stage where the competition thickens.</p>
<p>PSG.LGD has repeatedly landed in the top spots of The International, finishing as runner-ups in 2018 and 3rd in 2019. The 2020 event had to be postponed due to the global pandemic.</p>
<p>Building on a Strong Relationship</p>
<p>“Our relationship has gone from strength to strength and it’s been a very successful sponsorship for us. We’re now very excited to be able to take it to the next level,” Adkins added. PSG has called the partnership one of the most significant to date in the esports sector.</p>
<p>PSG.LGD director of brand diversification Fabien Allègre has said that the brand is thrilled to be building up on this relationship with Betway, which has supported the esports ecosystem and PSG’s own efforts in it.</p>
<p>“Through our existing relationship, Betway has proven itself to be an organisation that really understands the gaming community, and together we are looking forward to innovating and delivering truly unique and exclusive experiences to our fans together,” Allègre said.</p>
<p>The PSG partnership is one of many this year. The company previously extended its partnership with Berlin International Gaming (BIG) and launched the Betway Squad initiative in Brazil.</p>
