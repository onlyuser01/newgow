<p>Delasport, an online casino and sports betting solution company, is expanding its global reach. The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) granted the company two licenses, which gives it greater reach and more flexibility.</p>
<p>Delasport specializes in online sports betting and iGaming solutions for operators. According to a press release, the company has been granted two B2B licenses by the MGA, a Class 1 license for iGaming and a Class 2 license for sports betting.</p>
<p>Delasport has the licenses to offer a player account management solution (PAM) and a casino platform for operators. It also offers sports betting solutions. This is available via a turnkey solution or a plug-and-play iFrame option.</p>
<p>Oren Cohen Shwartz, CEO of the company, stated that in 2022, the company will enter newly regulated markets all over the world to support its partners' expansion strategy.</p>
<p>Delasport is on a roll these days. The most recent achievement was the acquisition in Romania of a Class 2 license, which allows Delasport to offer both sports betting solutions and iGaming. This was in August last year.</p>
<p>Gaming Labs International awarded the company GLI-19 and GLI-33.3 certifications three months later. The first covers interactive gaming systems, while the second addresses event wagering systems. Both of these are very important achievements. They will allow the company to access markets in North America and South America more easily, something Delasport is currently working on.</p>
<p>While it was closing the deal for its MGA license, Delasport was busy with another initiative. It entered into a new partnership agreement with TV Global Enterprises, the parent company of Latin America's Betcris iGaming brand.</p>
<p>They announced their partnership on Tuesday of last week. Delasport will offer solutions for TVGE via a complete turnkey solution that greatly enhances the operator's product portfolio.</p>
<p>JD Duarte, CEO of TV Global Enterprises, stated, "This deal will allow us to advance the development of strategic alliances where we participate in great new projects with great new partners. It was not an easy decision. We took our time to find the best technology partner and we found it."</p>
<p>The new partnership could offer Delasport additional benefits, as well. Betcris last year announced that it was expanding beyond Latin America, and that it had opened an office in Poland. The company is now focused on the European market, as well as global expansion.</p>
