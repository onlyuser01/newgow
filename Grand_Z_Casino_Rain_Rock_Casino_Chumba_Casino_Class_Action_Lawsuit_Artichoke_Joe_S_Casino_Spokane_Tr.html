<p>Sandy's Racing &amp; Gaming, the newest gaming and entertainment location for Eastern Kentucky opened its doors to visitors last week. The new gaming and entertainment facility represents a $75 million investment by Revolutionary Racing and brings a wide range of amenities.</p>
<p>Visitors to Sandy's Racing &amp; Gaming can enjoy a state-of-the-art BetMGM Race &amp; Sportsbook, as well as nearly 700 historical horse racing machines. The new 5,200 square-foot sportsbook offers three cinema-sized screens along with dozens of leather recliners. Ultimately, the sportsbook promises supreme sports betting entertainment.</p>
<p>Further amenities include two stages for performances, as well as a craft-focused kitchen with a variety of dining options featuring meat sourced locally from AW Meat House in Argillite. The premium entertainment facility is located at 10699 US 60 in Ashland, and it is open between 9 am and 4 am from Sunday through Thursday and 9 am and 6 am on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear attended the celebratory grand opening ceremony that took place Thursday. In a statement, he explained: "Sandy's Racing &amp; Gaming is bringing top-tier racing, gaming and entertainment to Northeastern Kentucky, along with hundreds of new jobs for the people who call Boyd County and the surrounding region home." Finally, Governor Beshear said: "Congratulations to Revolutionary Racing and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for creating this exciting destination."</p>
<p>Larry Lucas, Revolutionary Racing Kentucky's Chairman, shared the excitement of the Governor. "Last year, we promised to bring a first-class facility to Boyd County. Today, we can say â€“ promises made, promises kept," he explained.</p>
<p>The opening of the new gaming and entertainment facility comes after last summer, the gambling regulator in Kentucky, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, granted the final horse racing license for the state. At the time, Revolutionary Racing Kentucky secured the license, which was the ninth for the state, enabling it to proceed with the multi-million-dollar investment. During the construction phase, the project employed some 300 union workers. Approximately 90% of all supplies and materials used in the project were made in the United States.</p>
<p>Sandy's Racing &amp; Gaming will be the only venue in Kentucky to offer an equestrian center and a quarter horse racetrack. Those amenities will be positioned behind the venue, using some 182 acres of land. According to Revolutionary Racing Kentucky, the construction of the horse racetrack is expected to start next year with the first races expected at some point in 2025.</p>
