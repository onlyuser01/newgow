<p>Scientific Games (SG), the leading gaming technology and services provider, solidified its leadership position as a responsible gaming company by achieving the World Lottery Association’s (WLA) Responsible Gaming Framework Certificate of Alignment for its operations on five continents.</p>
<p>SG Achieves WLA’s Responsible Gaming Framework Certificate of Alignment</p>
<p>To achieve the certification, Scientific Games had to continuously improve its responsible gambling practices globally for digital, as well as retail products and services. Moreover, the company went through extensive auditing before receiving the WLA certification.</p>
<p>It was back in 2012 when the WLA invited SG industry experts to help create a responsible gaming framework. Consequently, the company was one of the first to be certified by the WLA as a responsible gambling supplier for its European instant games in 2015. Afterward, SG was recertified multiple times within all of its products.</p>
<p>The Company Keeps Focus On Growing Responsible Gambling Initiatives</p>
<p>Continuing the responsible gambling efforts, SG created the Healthy Play program in 2020. The innovative program helps promote healthy play by educating the players. Moreover, SG boosted responsible gambling efforts by creating Lottery employee responsible gaming training that aims to raise awareness of responsible play. The training was created in multiple languages and included customized content.</p>
<p>More recently, SG created a digital magazine for lotteries called the Healthy Play Guide. The magazine features responsible gambling tools as well as the Healthy Play program. This year, SG is expected to introduce a new website customizable for individual lotteries dubbed Healthy Play. Lottery stakeholders will be able to access the innovative website with the help of a QR code.</p>
<p>WLA: SG Is a Responsible Gaming Leader</p>
<p>Scientific Games Lottery’s VP of responsible gaming, Carla Schaefer, revealed that the company is honored to receive the Responsible Gaming Certification from the WLA. She explained that SG aims at providing its customers with the best practices and tools that help them market lottery “products in healthy and responsible ways.” In conclusion, Schaefer said that SG’s Healthy Play program helps promote responsible play while at the same time lotteries educate their players and establish trust.</p>
<p>“Scientific Games is honored to receive WLA’s Responsible Gaming Certification, which recognizes our ongoing commitment to Healthy Play across our global lottery organization.” Carla Schaefer, VP of responsible gaming for Scientific Games Lottery</p>
<p>WLA’s senior corporate social responsibility manager, Mélissa Azam, added that SG has undoubtedly established itself as a responsible gaming leader. She outlined that SG’s Healthy Play program “provides lotteries with real tools to support their own responsible gaming programs, demonstrates Scientific Games integration of the WLA Responsible Gaming Principles throughout the organization, and its investment in the future of the lottery industry.” In conclusion, Azam congratulated SG for their ongoing commitment to responsible gambling and said that the WLA is proud to support the company’s responsible gaming certification.</p>
