<p>Alice in Vegasland review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Alice in Vegasland is an Alice in Wonderland slot developed by Wizard Games. The slot reimagines the iconic story of Alice in Wonderland taking place in a modern-day Las Vegas setting.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wizard Games has kept things nice and simple with the design of the Alice in Vegasland slot game. The action takes place above the Vegas Strip skyline, with the reel borders glistening like a Las Vegas casino sign.</p>
<p>Alice, along with other characters like the Red Queen, The White Rabbit, and the Cheshire Cat all make appearances as symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>While the design for the game is fine, it does very little to stand out from the crowd. Instead of doing anything particularly innovative with Alice in her new setting, the game remains fairly static and simply places Alice-themed symbols on a Vegas-themed reel set.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game for Alice in Wonderland keeps things simple. The slot uses five reels and three rows, with ten active paylines on every spin. The game is controlled by using the button that is placed around the spin icon on the right-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>The paytable is opened by clicking the burger icon under the spin button, while autospin is activated by clicking the button on the opposite end.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Alice in Vegasland uses common features found in ‘Book of’ slots like Book of Ra and Book of Dead. The Free Spins bonus is launched when players land three or more Book Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>At the start of the round, a symbol is selected to become an expanding symbol. This will then expand to fill the reels whenever it lands.</p>
<p>Rabbit Bonus spins with Sticky Wild symbols</p>
<p>The other bonus is the Rabbit Bonus Spins. This is launched when you land three or more Rabbit Bonus symbols. During the round, any Wilds that land will stick to the reels. Two or three Wilds on the same reel will then join to become a giant locked Wild symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Alice in Vegasland has a fairly standard maths model. The RTP is a strong 96.24%, putting it above the industry average, which is something we recommend looking for in our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Alice In Vegasland slot</p>
<p>The maximum win in the game is 3,143x your stake, and the slot is highly volatile.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Alice in Vegasland is essentially a ‘Book of’ slot in everything but name. The Expanded Symbols and Free Spins combination has been a hit with players for years, and the Rabbit Bonus Spins is a welcome addition to the mix. The slot’s maximum win is nothing too special, though, and there are plenty of ‘Book of’ games that serve up better winning potential and more interesting designs. On the whole, the slot is solid enough, but it is not likely to live long in the memory.</p>
