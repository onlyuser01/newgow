    <h1>Casinos In Cleveland Ohio Towneplace Suites By Marriott Tampa Casino Area Macau Casinos Hyatt Regenc</h1>

<p>On January 12, 2023, I played the NETENT Starburst slot game around 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>After loading up, I started with a balance of 250 euros, which within a few minutes escalated to 1079€. This led me to end my session, closing the slot via the finish button. However, the balance did not revert to my account, which continuously displayed a balance of 250€. All of these were non-withdrawable, as if I had never played that slot. Upon checking the transaction history, the recently closed session did not show up. Neither in credits nor deductions, only the recent deposit was recorded. I tried to enter another provider's slot with the 250€, which indeed allowed me to play with 250€. I didn't gamble a single penny and quickly exited, attempting to re-enter the previously closed slot. Yet, I continuously encountered an error, which blocked access to every other NETENT slot.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have the complete recording from making the deposit to exiting the slot and all above mentioned actions. Therefore, I have the session code and all related data (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR3_BbIogaY). Entering it on the ADM website, this is what appeared:</p>
<p>Right to Participate: N5DCC25CAF6C60VT</p>
<p>Session: M5DCC2418C9150IJ on 12/01/2024</p>
<p>Licensor: GENIUS SRL</p>
<p>Bet Amount: € 250,00</p>
<p>Played on the date: 12/01/2024 at: 17:33:23</p>
<p>Right to Participate: Collected</p>
<p>I reached out to customer service via chat, and the operator, very kindly, told me it was an issue with the provider, and the balance would be credited back shortly. However, 25 days have passed, and the balance still doesn't appear. Also, I haven't encountered any issues with NETENT on any other site. The game proceeded smoothly, and closure wasn't an issue either.</p>
<p>The strange thing, compared to many anomalies you've described, is the presence of the 250€ deposit on my account which I'm free to use on any slot. It’s as if the NETENT session never happened.</p>
<p>After about a week, the slot became accessible again, but my balance did not return. I can clearly see that I played successfully on January 12, and even won. The history shows it all.</p>
<p>I've contacted customer service multiple times but they keep deferring and failing to provide any information. Currently, the site has been under maintenance for the past 16 days, stating that they cannot review my case until the technical maintenance is completed.</p>
<p>I've tried sending certified emails to ADM but they get sent but not delivered, I'm at a loss for what to do next.</p>
