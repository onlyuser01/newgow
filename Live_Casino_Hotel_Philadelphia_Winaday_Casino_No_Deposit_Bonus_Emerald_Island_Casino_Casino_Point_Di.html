<p>The program will have one exception to the substitution option, which is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation</p>
<p>The British Columbia Lottery Corporation, a Canadian Crown gambling company, has unveiled a new program that allows employees to select their holidays. Under the new program, the BCLC will allow its workers to substitute up to six holidays for other days of the year.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new program, workers will be able to set their holidays for dates that have personal, cultural or religious significance to them. The announcement is in line with British Columbia’s multiculturalism week and demonstrates the BCLC’s desire to promote diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>In addition to allowing its employees to pick their holidays, the BCLC will continue to implement inclusive policies that make its workers feel appreciated and welcomed. The company is guided by dedicated employee resource groups and is seeking to promote a “safe, equitable and barrier-free environment.”</p>
<p>However, the BCLC noted that there will be one exception to the substitution option, which is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. The company said that this holiday aligns with the message it is trying to send, which is why it must be observed by all of its employees.</p>
<p>For reference, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, also known as Orange Shirt Day, takes place on September 30 each year and celebrates the legacy of the Canadian Indian residential school system.</p>
<p>The Corporation Is Proud to Promote Inclusivity</p>
<p>Sandy Austin, the BCLC’s chief people officer, commented on the new changes. She pointed out that her company is an employer that recognizes there cannot be a “one size first all” approach when it comes to holidays. Since the gambling company wanted to promote inclusivity, it opted to provide its employees with an extra level of personalization when it comes to their days off.</p>
<p>This is another important step to build inclusive, equitable and safe workplaces and communities and we’re encouraging other employers to reach out to us to learn more. Sandy Austin, chief people officer, BCLC</p>
<p>Madhavee Inamdar, BCLC’s manager of diversity, inclusion and belonging, also commented on the new program, praising it for acknowledging the individual values and beliefs of the company’s employees.</p>
<p>We are incredibly fortunate to have such a diverse workforce and are honoring that diversity and reaffirming our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture at BCLC where all employees feel that they are seen, valued and belong. Madhavee Inamdar, manager of diversity, inclusion and belonging, BCLC</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the BCLC joined forces with Evolution to launch VIP games for high rollers.</p>
