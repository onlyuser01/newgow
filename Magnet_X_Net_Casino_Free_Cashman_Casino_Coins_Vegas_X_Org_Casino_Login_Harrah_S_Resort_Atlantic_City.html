<p>The following problem I paid 25 €, should get through only 20 ¬ 50 free spins ... I had to take 4-5 attempts, so my request has come to a conclusion and I then received my 50 free spins, in Tractor Beam ... So I had from my deposit still a balance balance of 7 ¬ I have not, I did not need any benefit, since I have received my free spins in Tractor Beam ... So I should use my free spins, no remaining balance of mine Deposit 25 € where still 7 € would be left, not dissolve in the air correct? But later I realized that differently. I played my 50 free spins and scored almost a good 50 € this can relate to my partner, she has seen everything. So now I thought € 50 is short from the free spins in the balance. Komisch waited a while updated several times, then hopes from the profit that will be credited to me, the account in real money, is indeed my profit. No, nothing happened, so I would have to force down the balance sheet with winning credits. Then I just wrote with support in chat and email dispute to no solution and agreement, over 1 hour or even even. In the later course of the evening I thought okay 7 € are still playing with it, how should it come to my account in real money what I would have deposited, the rest 7 € just disappeared. Since I put my time and patience in there, I decided to see this as a scam and bring it to the ad ...</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a mess like you're fooled and ripped off. Ugh hell</p>
<p>I give them a chance with their own proposal so I'm willing to compromise, but since no one commented on it, I decided to sue my lawyer for 5000 € and he takes apart wazamba, that's a promise. I will not let me rip off.</p>
