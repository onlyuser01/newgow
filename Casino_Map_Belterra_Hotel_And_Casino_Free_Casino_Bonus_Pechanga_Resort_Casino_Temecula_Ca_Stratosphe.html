<p>Aristocrat is further expanding its foothold in the US market, with news of its brand-new Lightning Dollar Link slot machine being installed in the Californian Pechanga Resort Casino, making sure the process gets lots of attention. The new machines combine elements of some fan favorites and seem to be generating a lot of interest from casino owners and players alike.</p>
<p>High Limit Area Gets New Slots</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming announced its Lightning Dollar Link machine in California’s Pechanga Resort Casino, making it one of the very first casinos to have it installed in the US. The Lightning Dollar Link machines were apparently installed in the casino’s high limit area, according to a news release, provided by Aristocrat, also available on the PR Newswire website.</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez – Vice President of slot operations at Pachanga Resort Casino welcomed the new slot machines and said he thinks that casino players “will really like it and have fun while playing it,” and complimented Aristocrat developers and designers by saying “they’ve done it again”, referring to the Lightning Dollar Link machines.</p>
<p>The new slot machines have an enhanced Hold &amp; Spin feature, which will give players the chance to win a progressive jackpot at three times the size of a single symbol. Games also have higher line counts and bet options inspired by the company’s Dragon Link machine, making lower denomination players able to choose between a 50-line or 100-line game, and $5-denomination players will be able to play in the 5-line or 10-line configuration. The Free Games feature will award players with free games if three or more scattered symbols are displayed. There is much more fun hidden within the machine’s “choice of five-to-100-line configurations” as the news release put it.</p>
<p>The news slots are said to combine elements from fan-favorite games such as Dragon Link, Lightning Link, Dollar Storm, and Buffalo Link, and their promotion at Pachanga is part of the ‘Live Like an Aristocrat’ marketing campaign. It will see members of the Pachanga Club play the new slots for a chance to win $2,000 in Pechanga Club dollars during the promotional period from September 26 through October 9.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming Growing Fast in US</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s biggest project in the US for the past five years was announced early this year in May, and it was already following positive news of the company strengthening its US foothold. If that wasn’t enough of a sign to indicate how serious the company was about its US presence, then its growing list of acquisitions should do it. And who can argue that it was a great strategy when the Aristocrat’s FY2021 H1 results made for great projections for the company’s future? In June we saw Aristocrat launching the $1 million jackpot at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood and Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tampa, Florida. This was just the minimum amount players could win, and was released exclusively for Seminole players in Hollywood and Tampa, Florida. Within the same month, Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment it would be launching Aristocrat machines in Connecticut as well.</p>
<p>Of course, Aristocrat isn’t aiming only at US expansion, as its Roxor Gaming acquisition might have already indicated. The fan-favorite Dragon Link machine was also installed in Manila, at the Solaire Resort &amp; Casino. Further expansion into the entire Asian continent is par for the course, as Trevor Croker, chief executive officer, and managing director said the company is entering H2 of 2022 with “excellent fundamentals,” meaning expecting more exciting news from Aristocrat is all but guaranteed.</p>
