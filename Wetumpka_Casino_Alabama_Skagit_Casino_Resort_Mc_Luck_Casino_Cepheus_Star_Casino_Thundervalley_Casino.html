<p>The new partnership will grant the company access to official in-game data from GRID, allowing it to develop esports-tailored integrity solutions</p>
<p>The leading sports integrity services provider, US Integrity, unveiled details regarding a new partnership. On Thursday the company said that it joined forces with the leading game data platform, GRID. Ultimately, the new deal seeks to help US Integrity expand within the esports integrity vertical by tapping into official in-game data from GRID.</p>
<p>Currently, US Integrity is globally recognized for its leading integrity and education solutions, as well as technology. The company leverages direct-from-the-source data, which enables it to deliver a complex product that fights against match-fixing, fraud, game manipulation, as well as other tampering attempts.</p>
<p>As a leader within the integrity vertical, US Integrity has partnerships with some of the biggest professional sports leagues such as MLB, PGA Tour and UFC. Additionally, the company has a strong presence in collegiate sports and is the preferred provider of many US-facing sports betting operators.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the new deal with GRID, the company seeks to develop esports-tailored integrity solutions within its platform. This will expand US Integrity’s portfolio with esports monitoring capabilities that will seek to help flag suspicious activities, integrity threats and other fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>By using official in-game data from GRID, US Integrity will deliver not only monitoring capabilities but also bring other solutions that cater to the esports vertical. The new deal and the company’s expansion come at a strategic moment when esports betting continues to gain traction in the US.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Moritz Maurer, GRID’s CEO, shared his excitement about the recent collaboration. He pointed out that the two companies “share a vision for a data-driven integrity approach in esports.” Finally, Maurer explained: “Combining our expertise we aim to ensure the integrity of the match, the source, and the bet in any esports title and introduce more scalable frameworks for the industry as a whole.”</p>
<p>“Via their successful partnerships with rights holders, and cutting-edge technology, we see GRID as a natural industry leader and an excellent collaborator in the endeavor to establish new integrity frameworks in esports.“ Scott Sadin, COO at US Integrity</p>
<p>Scott Sadin, US Integrity’s COO, spoke about the complexity of integrity. He explained that integrity doesn’t only involve combatting match-fixing but is also connected to policies and procedures and even education. According to Sadin, those are the essential elements of a framework that can be sustainable in the long term for any ecosystem.</p>
<p>Addressing the deal with GRID, he said that US Integrity will benefit from its official esports data. Finally, Sadin explained that GRID was identified as the perfect partner given its strong presence in esports.</p>
