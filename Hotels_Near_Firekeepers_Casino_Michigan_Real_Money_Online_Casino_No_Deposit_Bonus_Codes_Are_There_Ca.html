    <h1>Hotels Near Firekeepers Casino Michigan Real Money Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Are There Ca</h1>

<p>The incident unfolded around 11:50 p.m., just moments before the city welcomed the new year</p>
<p>Marc Webley, a 38-year-old man with a notorious past in Edinburgh’s gangland scene, was shot dead outside the Anchor Inn in Granton, Edinburgh, UK. Webley, known for his tumultuous relationship with Jane Parks, the UK’s youngest EuroMillions winner, met a tragic end in what authorities believe to be a targeted attack.</p>
<p>Gunshots Mistaken for Fireworks Unveil Marc Webley’s Violent End</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses reported hearing gunshots in the area, initially mistaking them for fireworks. Police responded to the scene and discovered Webley lifeless, with another man, 39, in serious but stable condition, reported the New York Post.</p>
<p>Webley’s history was marred by a notorious 11-year prison sentence for the attempted murder of a rival gang member in 2005. Last year, he was acquitted of two attempted murders after allegedly ramming his car into another vehicle with occupants inside. The shooting on New Year’s Eve adds another chapter to his troubled past.</p>
<p>Jane Parks, who had won £1 million ($1.3 million) in the EuroMillions lottery at the age of 17, expressed her grief on social media. Parks and Webley had an on-and-off relationship for about a year, with Parks sharing heartfelt sentiments about the time they spent together.</p>
<p>She posted on her Instagram: “I can’t believe I’m writing this. If I could cuddle you again and tell you everything is going to be OK, I would give anything to do it, Marc.”</p>
<p>Parks, now 28, had distanced herself from Webley, evident from her social media posts in December hinting at a breakup. Despite their differences, the tragic news deeply affected Parks, leaving her devastated.</p>
<p>Road Closures and Chaos Follow Gang Violence Twist in Anchor Inn Shooting</p>
<p>Authorities confirmed road closures around the Anchor Inn, and investigations are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the altercation. Locals described the chaotic scene just before the bells, as emergency services rushed to the area.</p>
<p>Webley’s death took a sinister turn as reports surfaced of his involvement in gang violence. Prior to the incident, he posted provocative videos on social media, seemingly challenging his adversaries to confront him at the Anchor Inn.</p>
<p>In other news, a 45-year-old man, identified as J.L., was arrested in Las Vegas after allegedly firing a handgun from an MGM Signature Towers balcony near the Strip. The incident, described as an “isolated” event, occurred in the early morning hours on December 31. Although no injuries were reported, the suspect faces 74 criminal charges, including discharging a weapon in a prohibited area. Due to medical reasons, the alleged shooter did not appear in court on Monday.</p>
