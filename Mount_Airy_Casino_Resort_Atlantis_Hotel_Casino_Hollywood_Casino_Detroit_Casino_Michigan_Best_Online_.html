<p>A Las Vegas tourist remained in jail with bail set at $500,000 on accusations of forcing a woman to have sex in public in front of one of the casinos on the Las Vegas strip.</p>
<p>Gambling without Violence</p>
<p>Samuel Garee Jr, a 45-year-old resident of Salem, Oregon, reportedly tore off a piece of a woman’s ear, while forcing her to have sex near a bust stop on the Vas Vegas Strip and is facing charges with sex assault resulting in substantial bodily harm, kidnapping and battery.</p>
<p>Around 1:30 after midnight on Tuesday, an employee of the Strat Hotel and Casino on the Strip called the police and informed them that a man and a woman were attempting to have sex in public and the woman was injured. Police officers found the woman with several injuries, including missing a part of her ear.</p>
<p>Garee, who told the police he was in Vegas to celebrate the birth of his grandchild and stayed in another hotel on the Strip, insisted that he had no memory of the incident but video surveillance confirmed the sex act on him. Further, several witnesses told the police that they saw him punch the woman in the face.</p>
<p>The victim was taken to a hospital and when police went there to speak with her, she told the officers she had just met Garee and accompanied him to the casino as he seemed a nice person but she was adamant she had no intention of having sex with him. Doctors told the police she had several facial fractures, cuts and a piece of her ear was missing.</p>
<p>Garee remained in the Clark County Detention Center following a court appearance late this week in which Judge Holly Stoberski set his bail at half-a-million dollars. If he is found guilty, he could face a lengthy jail sentence.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Remembers</p>
<p>In March, Lawrence David Shaw, a Texas resident, who sexually assaulted a woman back in 1996 in a Las Vegas gaming parlor but escaped charges then, was identified thanks to a DNA test, got arrested and would stand trial 25 years after his actions.</p>
<p>Much like Garee, Shaw had told the police he had poor memories of the incident at King 8 Hotel and Casino on West Tropicana Avenue but sternly denied he ever had any physical relationship with the alleged victim.</p>
<p>However, a blood sample found on the victim and processed in 2019 contained Shaw’s DNA and the victim decided to press charges as Shaw’s actions traumatized her and were the reason for her divorce.</p>
