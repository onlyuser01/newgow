<p>Portsmouth, Va. TV station WAVY reported that Rudy Feuerschutz of Chesapeake received the ban after playing blackjack last month at the Virginia gaming property. A casino employee told him he had committed loan sharking, the man revealed.</p>
<p>But he told WAVY that he didn’t commit loan sharking. He did confirm he loaned $500 to a friend while in the gaming property on two different instances, WAVY reported.</p>
<p>I think it is all hearsay,” Feuerschutz told WAVY. “I lent a friend of mine $500 twice at the table on a double-down hand, which he paid me back that night.”</p>
<p>He claimed didn’t charge any interest on the loans. Loan sharking would indicate that the lender charged the borrower high interest.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino didn’t explain to WAVY why the player was banned. Nor did it confirm the ban.</p>
<p>“Like most large-scale entertainment venues, we are committed to prioritizing a standard of conduct that preserves our guest experience,” Kelli Webb, a casino spokesperson, told WAVY about the incident.</p>
<p>Feuerschutz said he appealed the ban. But the appeal was rejected, WAVY reported.</p>

<p>Two Atlantic City teens were apprehended after a robbery and car theft occurred at the Tropicana Atlantic City last month. On August 22, the two teens allegedly assaulted a woman and stole her purse, according to Atlantic City radio station WPG.</p>
<p>The teens found the woman’s keys in her purse and then allegedly stole her car from the casino’s parking garage, according to police. The car was found on Trenton Avenue in Atlantic City the following day.</p>
<p>Several individuals watched as police waited for the car to get towed. Among those watching were the two suspects, police said. They were identified based on a surveillance photo from the casino. Both are 16 years of age. Neither was identified. Each was charged with conspiracy, robbery, simple assault, and theft, WPG reported.</p>
<p>They were both booked at the Essex County Juvenile Detention Facility.</p>
