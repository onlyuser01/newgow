<p>Suncatcher Gigablox review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Suncatcher Gigablox is themed around a variety of gems.</p>
<p>Players will enter a sci-fi world of floating jewels in vivid shades of violet, mint green, yellow, red, and fuschia pink. If they can navigate this mysterious realm, they might just snag some of the priceless stones.</p>
<p>Suncatcher Gigablox will suit players who enjoy gem-themed slots, and those in the mood for a mystical vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The understated soundtrack is played in a minor key, giving the game a sombre atmosphere. The reels spin with slick mechanical sounds that bring to mind a spaceship preparing to take off. This adds to the slot's futuristic feel.</p>
<p>The rainbow of gems is animated in an ethereal cartoon style, with light seeming to illuminate them from behind. The facets twinkle, giving each of the vivid colors an appealing shine.</p>
<p>The most coveted gem symbol contains some of each color, making it the undisputed star of the reels. Players will be immediately struck by the artistic animation of this alluring stone.</p>
<p>The reels are framed with a minimalist line of light that gleams in different hues as well. Beyond the reels, everything is dark, allowing the stones to stand out. This also seems to suggest the jewels might be hovering in space, catching the rays of a distant sun.</p>
<p>Suncatcher Gigablox’s bright colors and dreamy soundtrack suggest an ‘80s influence, and some players might have fun remembering retro sci-fi adventure narratives.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and graphics create an eye-catching world of precious gems.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Suncatcher Gigablox is a five reel, three row slot with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The Gigablox feature means that during each spin, a random number of reels can connect together to create a Colossal Gigablox. This is an extra large symbol that creates more possible wins.</p>
<p>The pace of the gameplay is smooth and swift, ensuring players will stay engaged.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols and is optimized to pay the highest prize available. For example, if a Wild symbol would pay out more by substituting for a different symbol, then it would substitute for that symbol.</p>
<p>Every Wild symbol covers its entire reel by expanding and gives players a respin during which Wilds remain sticky. Players can continue these respins for as long as Wild symbols last.</p>
<p>If players cover all reels with Wild symbols, a prize of 500x their total bet is awarded.</p>
<p>Players can opt to turn on the Golden Bet feature which doubles their bet and provides x3 or more the chance of landing Wild symbols during the base spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96%, exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€500 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Suncatcher Gigablox is low-medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this average RTP, low-medium volatility gem-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the RTP is decent, the low-medium volatility will leave mathematically -minded players of Suncatcher Gigablox less than awestruck.</p>
<p>The graphics are well-executed, and some players who prefer lower volatility may still have plenty of fun giving this slot a try.</p>
