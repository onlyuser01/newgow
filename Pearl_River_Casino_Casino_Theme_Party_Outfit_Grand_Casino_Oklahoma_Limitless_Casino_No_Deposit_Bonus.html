    <h1>Pearl River Casino Casino Theme Party Outfit Grand Casino Oklahoma Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>I have been a customer of Luckey Creek for a few years....I have spent thousands on gaming with you guys. I am going to be leaving this gaming portal as your customer service to answering customers is terrible. I would like to say that you can keep my 100 dollars that you took from my account and then did not deposit to the site. After complaining and asking for help your live chat never had any answers and every operator asks for the same stuff but never gets back to the customer. It's a joke. I have sent emails with proof the money came out of my account and the transfer that was accepted with a confirmation of #437 I spent hours on the phone on the 15th only to do it all over again on the 16....your support team HAS NEVER REPLIED .......But you know what is funny? your VIP team always sending emails trying to get people to spend more money....So you can send out emails trying to encourage more gaming but support does not help when you need assistance. I will be spending my money at Jackpot city from now on. You can go right ahead and process that money to my account I will spend that in 2 bets and you will not see me on lucky creek again. Because I know instead of refunding my money you will put it on my account so I game with it...I will do that and then I will be gone I hate giving my money to hungry companies that have no care in the world for their customers except to entice them through email to spend money daily I get a email daily but no reply from support.....This will also be a google review and I'm sure other people have this same issue and I want them to read that.</p>
