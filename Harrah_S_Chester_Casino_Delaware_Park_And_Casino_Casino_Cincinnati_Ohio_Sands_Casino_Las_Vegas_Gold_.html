    <h1>Harrah S Chester Casino Delaware Park And Casino Casino Cincinnati Ohio Sands Casino Las Vegas Gold</h1>

<p>I'm a player with gambling addiction problems, on 26/05/2021 I asked for self-exclusion from several casinos, including casino intense, and as a consequence I would also be self-excluded from all partner casinos of this casino.</p>
<p>On 19-08-21 I registered and opened an account at playzax casino, partner casino of intense casino, where I was self-excluded, so they could never have accepted my registration, I used the same email, the same address, the same phone and even the same username as at the partner casino, before making a deposit I spoke to customer support to ask what deposit and withdrawal methods they had available, and they still didn't stop me from making the deposits. deposits made during the day between 14h:36m and 22h, totaling €1,620, causing a disgrace in my life and putting me in a very complicated financial situation, all because they didn't stop me as they should have done, respecting the principle of the game responsible, and knowing that I am a person out of control and with gambling addiction issues that's why I asked for self-exclusion.</p>
<p>The casino just closed my account the next day claiming that the account and deposits were made overnight when the responsible staff was not there, but that's not true the account and deposits were made during the day and no one stopped me, when they closed my account it was too late for another €1620 had already been deposited by me, I now ask for the value of the deposits back as I could never have opened an account at the casino as it was auto-excluded</p>
