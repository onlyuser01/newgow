    <h1>Grand Falls Casino Taj Mahal Casino Casinos In Indiana Northern Quest Casino Concerts 4 Winds Casino</h1>

<p>I earnestly implore you to help me; this casino is fraudulent. They have been messing with me for a week. On November 25th, 2023, I deposited 95 dollars and won more or less 250 dollars at the casino. I want to clarify that I only played at the casino and did not use any bonuses. I attempted a withdrawal but was told to wait for a few hours. More than a day passed and they cancelled my withdrawal claiming technical glitches, and I lost the money. On November 27, I made another deposit, won around 160 dollars, and again couldn't withdraw my winnings. I was told to undergo verification. I was in the hospital at the time, so I could only complete the verification process around December 14. I had lost the money by then, but the support team promptly told me everything was okay and my account was verified, promising no further problems. I deposited money twice more and won a significant amount of 160,000 rubles on my fourth attempt. When I tried to withdraw the amount on December 18, 2023, the operator told me to wait for a few hours, yet two days have already passed. The casino itself cancels my withdrawals every 24 hours and immediately reassures me that everything is fine. When I try to withdraw the funds again, I'm told to wait and they cancel the withdrawal after 24 hours. I will attach screenshots of the conversation in which it's clear that before making a deposit, I clarified several times with the support team whether my account was in order, and I was assured that there would be no issues with my account. Now their support service simply does not respond to me, leading me to believe they are scammers. How did they get such a high rating? I desperately ask for your assistance. I will attach all the evidence, and you can see for yourself that the support service repeatedly confirmed that my account was verified and in good condition.</p>
