<p>Pragmatic Play, a company of great renown in the iGaming sector, has announced that it is expanding its local presence in the Slovakian gaming market through a partnership with Niké, a well-established local brand, one of the highest-rated casino brands on the Casino Guru Safety Index.</p>
<p>A prominent local player Niké will now benefit from a range of titles delivered by the supplier, the press release detailed. Among the games that will be available in the operator’s library are such titles as Gates of Olympus, SugarRush, Tundra’s Fortune, Cash Chips and more.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides has welcomed this new opportunity and said that she was excited to see her company strengthen its presence in another regulated market through a major operator such as Niké.</p>
<p>"We look forward to a great partnership with Niké as it continues to strengthen its offering as a top operator in the market," she added. Pragmatic Play has been on a tear of late, with the company releasing a festive version of its Big Bass slot game, and the supplier also adding Timber Stacks as another worthwhile option to its library.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play also announced an expansion move into Brazil with Betmais earlier this month and has been generally determined to continue expanding and moving forward in exciting new iGaming markets.</p>
<p>As to Niké, a spokesperson for the casino said that adding Pragmatic Play to the operator’s library of titles was indeed a smart and important move that allowed the brand to consolidate its presence locally and also increase the player satisfaction players get out of visiting the website.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has also recently worked on other similar partnerships across Europe, with the company successfully signing a content partnership with Napoleon in Belgium and GAMRFIRST in Switzerland, leaving its mark on two prominent local brands and excellent markets.</p>
