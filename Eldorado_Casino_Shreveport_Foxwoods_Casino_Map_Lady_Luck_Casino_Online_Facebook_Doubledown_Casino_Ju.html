<p>The leading supplier of table, slot and interactive products and services, powering the global gambling sector, AGS, continues to expand its footprint in North America. The company announced on Wednesday that it secured a major approval, allowing its growing portfolio of electronic gaming machines (EGMs), as well as table products to reach new casino operators in two US states, Missouri and Colorado.</p>
<p>AGS acknowledged that the entry into the two states represents a major milestone in its expansion strategy. Moreover, the company highlighted that the entry in Missouri and Colorado complements its ongoing goal to become a leading supplier of technology, games and services to casino operators across North America.</p>
<p>The latest entry comes after AGS recently confirmed the launch of Spectra UR43, its latest portrait upright cabinet that features the fan-favorite Triple Coin Treasures game series. The aforementioned games have already proven their popularity in different regulated gambling markets across North America.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the new market entry, players in Missouri and Colorado will soon be able to access the thrilling games as well. The launch of Spectra UR43 took the gambling sector by storm. The cabinet quickly proved its popularity and was in fact recognized by the Eilers &amp; Krejcik Game Performance survey, a statement released by AGS reveals.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest launch, players in Missouri will be able to access Triple Coin Treasures games at Argosy Casino Hotel &amp; Spa, Bally's Kansas City Casino, River City Casino Hotel, Hollywood Casino St. Louis, Horseshoe St. Louis, Harrah's Kansas City and Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City. On the other hand, several casinos in Colorado will also bring the thrilling games for their players. Those include Century Casino &amp; Hotel Central City, Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk and Golden Nugget Cripple Creek.</p>
<p>Mark DeDeaux, AGS' Senior Vice President and General Manager, was excited about the company's latest achievement. "Getting licensed in these two important jurisdictions is a meaningful piece of AGS' overall growth strategy, in combination with the investments we have made in hiring top talent within R&amp;D and expanding our game studios worldwide," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, DeDeaux pointed out: "We are pleased to be able to offer our high-performing, chart-topping new products to customers in both the Colorado and Missouri markets."</p>
<p>Only recently, AGS confirmed it strengthened its C-suite with the appointment of Bob Blair as Deputy General Counsel. The senior-level hire was announced last month and saw Blair, who is an expert with solid experience in corporate legal affairs, strengthen the company's team.</p>
