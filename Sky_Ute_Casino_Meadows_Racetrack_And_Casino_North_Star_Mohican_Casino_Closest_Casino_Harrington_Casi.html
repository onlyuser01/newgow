<p>Fresh off the back of winning the prestigious EGR B2B Award for Best Live Casino Supplier, Vivo Gaming continues to innovate, improve its offering and move into new markets at pace.</p>
<p>To find out more, we spoke to Neil Howells, CCO at Vivo Gaming about its next steps and highly anticipated new products.</p>
<p>Could you tell us about how Vivo Gaming's offering has evolved over the past two years and how that appeals to a modern audience?</p>
<p>The last two years have seen Vivo Gaming open multiple state-of-the-art studios in strategic locations worldwide. Localization is an aspect of the business that we take extremely seriously, tailoring the games and how they are presented specifically to the audiences in these regions.</p>
<p>As well as that, we have ensured that our games are not only compatible on desktops, but across mobile devices. This is key to appealing to a global audience.</p>
<p>While our main offering continues to be live dealer content and innovative offshoots from that, we have expanded effectively with several RNG providers, offering a host of different products. Joining the Vivo Gaming family as a partner or client means you get more than our live dealer products, but a whole suite of third-party providers that form part of the same integration. You don’t just get live dealer casinos, but hundreds of slots, table games, and virtual sports.</p>
<p>Are there untapped markets Vivo Gaming is currently working to break into? What challenges and opportunities does this pose?</p>
<p>South Asia and South American markets have all the hallmarks of markets that Vivo Gaming targets. There is high demand for a fresh offering that optimizes the player experience and the infrastructure to facilitate this is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>As well as that, the disposable income that players have to hand is growing at pace in both these regions and regulation is becoming far more hospitable in large swathes of these landscapes.</p>
<p>Of course, there will always be challenges when entering new markets, and significant investment into more resources and energy is called for. On top of that, no two markets are alike and those thinking of utilizing the copy and paste approach are automatically setting themselves up for failure. Localisation is the only viable approach.</p>
<p>For example, in the Spanish-speaking world, we are well on our way to rolling out Spanish-speaking dealer tables and Live Bingo, which will fit in perfectly with the South American market.</p>
<p>What is Vivo Gaming doing to elevate the player experience in the Asian market?</p>
<p>Historically, players in Asian countries prefer fast-paced games with a lively studio environment and a high degree of interactivity. With this in mind, we are launching a speed baccarat game and promotional tools to meet these demands to keep the players engaged and satisfied constantly.</p>
<p>Our Promotional Tournament Tool engages customers with prizes, displaying boosters and the potential of big wins. It also lets them know in real-time when they are close to the top spot of a leader board. Operators will be able to ensure their customers have an engaging experience by integrating features such as unlimited players, a countdown timer, player rankings, and real-time communication.</p>
<p>What are the latest innovations in Live Casino that users are reacting to?</p>
<p>Our intuitive Chroma Key solution is one of our latest innovations in Live Casino. By placing a solid color background behind our dealer, they can be transported to any location in the world using Chroma Key technology. Additionally, any animation, brand, logo or video imaginable can be added to the screen, boosting the studio design and interactivity.</p>
<p>On top of that, our new CMS Lobby boasts a unique interactive lobby with a live thumbnail, allowing players to intuitively navigate the system. This unique live casino addition also allows for a fully interactive inter-player chat on both desktop and mobile in landscape and portrait modes.</p>
<p>Of course, we are constantly working on new ways to wow our clients and their customers, but we don’t want to give away too much just yet.</p>
