<p>The State of New South Wales in Australia is unflinching in its determination to introduce cashless technology across the stateâ€™s pubs and casinos. To get there, small steps are necessary with the first one in this direction undertaken by the Independent Panel on Gaming Reform, which has issued public invitations to venues and technology providers to become among the first to trial the new technology.</p>
<p>Although feared by some businesses and even snubbed by customers, the consensus is that cashless gaming would help patch up a lot of the problems that New South Wales has experienced in the past years, including money laundering, and an increasing number of problem gamblers. Now, the Independent Panel on Gaming Reform is confident that it can coax innovation-driven businesses to leap forward. The goal of the trial is, as the regulator puts it:</p>
<p>"The trials will assess how these cashless gaming solutions operate in real-world conditions in clubs and hotels. The impact of these technologies will be identified, monitored and assessed by an independent researcher."</p>
<p>The candidates will need to meet a number of criteria that are set out by the Independent Panel and are important to ensure that the technology will have the best chance of showcasing its strength, such as combatting money laundering and enhancing harm minimization.</p>
<p>Another equally important matter and a thorn in the rollout of the technology is fear about privacy protections and data security. This issue has been raised by lawmakers, companies, and even consumers, with some clubs fearing that it would alienate their customer base and make them believe they are "criminals."</p>
<p>All applications must be submitted by October 13, the official statement by the NSW Gaming and LiquorCommission states. Overall, the plan is to ensure a future in which cashless gaming becomes the norm. There are several ways that this technology can indeed have a positive impact on existing operations.</p>
<p>Cashless gaming would make it much easier for companies to in theory track how much their consumer spend and protect them. Those who oppose this statement though argue that online gaming, such as betting on sports, is also cashless in its nature but people do become addicted and suffer financial loss.</p>
<p>The NSW however remains committed to pursuing this course of action and installing a future which will see the gambling industry turn more heavily to cashless gaming tech. The state has been doing more in the past months to ensure that responsible gambling standards are upheld across its network of pubs and clubs for the most part but has also taken action against the Star Casino in the state.</p>
