<p>StarGames.de has expanded its local presence in the regulated German market by teaming up with Hannover 96, a prominent soccer club</p>
<p>The partnership with the Greentube Group brand will last for the 2023/2024 season and StarGames.de will serve as sponsor and team presenter. The logo of the operator will also be featured on the training and warm-up kits for the soccer club, as well as displayed in the Heinz von Heiden Arena.</p>
<p>Boosting Brand Awareness with Hannover 96</p>
<p>The partnership marks an important milestone for the operator which will have its brand awareness boosted thanks to its tie-up with the second-division team. This collaboration is also demonstrating a meaningful way to build sponsorships between gambling operators in the regulated market and sports clubs.</p>
<p>The club itself draws a massive crowd, with more than 30,900 fans attending on average, making it the third largest club in terms of fan presence during live games in Bundesliga 2, the second-tier division of the German soccer championship.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, StarGames brand manager László Pados said that his company was excited to have this opportunity, arguing that the clubs share many similarities when it comes to their long-term goals and ethos:</p>
<p>Commitment, passion, and fair play are values that are important not only to Hannover 96, but also to us as fundamental cornerstones for our company and brand. StarGames brand manager László Pados</p>
<p>Launching New Fan Experiences Across the Board</p>
<p>StarGames will also work closely with Hannover 96 to promote various prize draws and other activations designed to boost the level of fun and engagement for fans. StarGames marketing manager Andreas Jansch already has some ideas about how this can happen.</p>
<p>“This partnership provides us with an exciting opportunity to reach the many 96 fans and demonstrate our enthusiasm for outstanding achievement, both on and off the pitch,” Jansch said.</p>
<p>The marketing agency Sportfive which has helped negotiate the partnership was similarly pleased with the achievement, arguing that Hannover 96 and StarGames.de will achieve high visibility. The partnership comes at an interesting time for industry regulation not just in Germany, but in most mature gambling markets.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, for example, is raising an issue with partnerships between sports teams and gambling entities, with the tendencies pointing to their elimination.</p>
