<p>Tiger Woods Masters Odds Shorten Following Strong Performance at Honda Classic</p>

<p>Following a strong performance at The Honda Classic where Woods finished 12th with rounds of 70-71-69-70, oddsmakers are shortening Tiger’s line as his game seemingly progresses to better form. At 16/1, only Dustin Johnson (7/1), Jordan Spieth (9/1), Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, and Jason Day (12/1) have shorter odds.</p>
<p>Woods hasn’t won a major since the 2008 US Open. It’s also been more than four years since his last PGA Tour victory. But bettors, who flock to print tickets with Woods on long odds, have forced handicappers to shrink his line.</p>
<p>Woods’ 16/1 Masters odds are shorter than Justin Rose (18/1), the winner of the 2013 US Open who finished runner-up last year in Augusta.</p>
<p>Tiger’s also shorter than Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson, who have combined won the major five times (Phil in 2004, 2006, 2010; Bubba in 2012, 2014). The SuperBook has both lefties at 25/1. Defending champion Sergio Garcia is even longer at 50/1.</p>
<p>“I thought I played well this week, I really did,” Woods said on Sunday. “I had control. I’m pleased with the progress I made and I gave myself a chance.”</p>
<p>Prior to his Honda Classic showing, the SuperBook’s Masters odds on Woods were at 25/1. Thomas, who won in a playoff on Sunday, saw his green jacket line shorten from 15/1 to 12/1.</p>
<p>Tiger Rebound</p>
<p>It’s been a struggle for Tiger Woods in recent years. Last May, the 14-time major champion was arrested for DUI near his Jupiter, Florida, mansion. No alcohol was found in his system, but the golfer was determined to be intoxicated from a dangerous mix of medications.</p>
<p>After undergoing rehab, his first official PGA Tour event in 2018 came at the Farmers Insurance Open last month. He made the weekend and finished T23 at -3. But excitement surrounding Tiger’s comeback was derailed earlier this month at the Genesis Open after Woods shot 72-76 to miss the cut by three shots.</p>
<p>His 12th-place finish this past weekend is his best finish in an official PGA Tour event since the Wyndham Championship in August 2015 where he finished 10th.</p>
<p>Tiger Delivers</p>
<p>Before the first round of The Honda Classic, the SuperBook had Woods at 60/1 to win the tournament. The Westgate of course won on all those wagers, but lost when it came to whether he would make the cut. The casino had Tiger playing the weekend at even money, and “No” at -120.</p>
<p>A top 20 finish also paid out for bettors who continued to have faith. Woods was at “Yes +350,” “No -450,” meaning every $100 bet netted $350.</p>
<p>Woods hasn’t announced his next tournament, but he’ll presumably play at the Arnold Palmer Invitational next month. Tiger has won at Bay Hill a record eight times, including four consecutive years from 2000 to 2003.</p>
