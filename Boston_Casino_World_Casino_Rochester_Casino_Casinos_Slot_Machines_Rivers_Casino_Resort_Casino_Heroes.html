    <h1>Boston Casino World Casino Rochester Casino Casinos Slot Machines Rivers Casino Resort Casino Heroes</h1>

<p>Thank you very much, Kalbim, for your reply and for forwarding all the relevant communication. I have checked Speedy Casino Responsible Gaming section, and this is what I found https://www.speedycasino.com/en/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>"Self-exclusion</p>
<p>We provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by the player themselves by clicking here when you are logged on to your account, or by contacting support@speedycasino.com. A self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or indefinitely.</p>
<p>Prior to confirming your self-exclusion request, you will be provided with information regarding the consequences of self-exclusion. Should you decide to self-exclude, we encourage you to consider extending your self-exclusion to other remote gambling operators where you have an active account. Any undetermined bets at the time of your self-exclusion will be settled in the normal way, according to the normal timescales and, if subsequently applicable, winnings will be paid out. Any self-exclusion cannot be undone during the agreed period of self-exclusion and your account will not be reactivated under any circumstances during the exclusion period.</p>
<p>To reopen your account after the self-exclusion has expired, a written request must be submitted to support@speedycasino.com after which we will help you return to the website with our standard procedure.</p>
<p>For additional information about how we treat self-exclusion, such as potential closure of other accounts on sites managed and operated by the license holder, please visit the Terms and Conditions section. As per our license obligations, if you state that you have gambling problems, you will automatically be excluded from other websites managed or operated by us. This will occur no later than 24 hours after your initial self-exclusion request has been received by us. During the period of self-exclusion, it will NOT be possible to reopen the account and any requests to do so will automatically be rejected. You will also be removed from all marketing material.</p>
<p>We also recommend installing software that allows you to block your internet access to gambling websites. Filtering Systems can be found in the last section of this page."</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you have created an account with Casino Heroes with the same email address and personal information as the one with Speedy Casino? Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. Thank you in advance.</p>
