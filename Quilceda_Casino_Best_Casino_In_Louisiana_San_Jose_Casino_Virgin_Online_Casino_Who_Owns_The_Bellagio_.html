    <h1>Quilceda Casino Best Casino In Louisiana San Jose Casino Virgin Online Casino Who Owns The Bellagio</h1>

<p>Manufacturer of slot machines and casino management systems Konami announced its Las Vegas-based subsidiary agreed for a joint integration with supplier of sports betting technology Bet.Works.</p>
<p>Casino Loyalty Programs</p>
<p>Konami Gaming and the sports betting platform provider agreed to integrate interfaces of Bet.Works with Konami’s SYNKROS casino management system to facilitate operations at land-based gaming facilities related to casino loyalty programs.</p>
<p>“The result of this joint integration is truly a turn-key solution for casinos to extend their loyalty experience in and throughout the sports betting module. The supportive networks between SYNKROS and Bet.Works make an array of interactions more seamless and automated for players and operators.” Marc Brody, SVP, Business Development, Bet.Works</p>
<p>The integration will provide casinos with the option to easily validate age eligibility and automate the process of enrollment for online and mobile sign-ups into their loyalty programs, as well as seamlessly award loyalty points for wagers placed online, via mobile, at point-of-sale (POS), or at a betting kiosk.</p>
<p>“At its core, SYNKROS is designed to empower casinos to grow and leverage the latest top technology available, through its robust, dependable, and scalable architecture. When we can work together to create more convenience for the player, more growth opportunities for the operator, and more technology advancements for the industry, then everyone benefits.” Tom Jingoli, Executive VP and COO, Konami Gaming</p>
<p>Integrations Exceeded Expectations</p>
<p>These leading conveniences to the sports betting experience, as Konami calls them in the official press release, already debuted at Elite Casino Resorts and its ELITE Sportsbook, as well as across Riverside Casino &amp; Golf Resort, Grand Falls Casino &amp; Golf Resort and Rhythm City Casino Resort in Iowa.</p>
<p>“As a multi-site, multi-channel operator, we believe a consistent and convenient loyalty experience is especially important. The interface between Konami and Bet.Works allows us to achieve this aspect while expanding our entertainment offering.” Karlyn Ollendick, COO, Elite Casino Resorts</p>
<p>The integration solution engineered between Konami Gaming and Bally’s betting technology supplier Bet.Works demonstrated its potential in the field, being deployed at locations operated by Elite Casinos, which has been a SYNKROS customer for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>“Player response and adoption has exceeded expectations, and we’re anticipating continued growth as SYNKROS and Bet.Works continue to work together to drive engagement and rewards through ELITE Sportsbook.” Karlyn Ollendick, COO, Elite Casino Resorts</p>
