<p>AT&amp;T Sports Net has teamed up with VSiN to boost sports betting coverage in the Pittsburgh area in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Sports and VSiN Have Teamed for More Sports Betting Coverage</p>
<p>VSiN and AT&amp;T Sports Net have teamed up to distribute more sports betting content to subscribers in Pittsburgh as the broadcaster feels confident that interest in tailored products will only grow.</p>
<p>Calling the business opportunity credible and actionable, AT&amp;T is prepared to ramp up its engagement with the sector. VSiN’s dedicated product, Follow the Money, will now air on AT&amp;T Sports Net across the Pittsburgh territory targeted by the programming and be available every day at 3 pm ET.</p>
<p>With interest in sports betting surging and state residents placing $3.5 billion in total betting handle in 2020, behind only New Jersey and Nevada, media companies are keen to get hold a share of the market in the Keystone State and beyond.</p>
<p>Super Bowl LV remote betting last Sunday hit record levels, with the American Gaming Association (AGA) forecasting that one-third of the total bets staked on the Big Game would come from mobile consumers.</p>
<p>The early estimate wasn’t enough to avoid mishaps along the way, with FanDuel, DraftKings, and BetMGM reporting outages which, in some cases, stretched both before and during the game, stirring sports fans’ indignation on-site and at home.</p>
<p>With the dust now settled, March Madness is the next big ticket on the sports betting calendar and VSiN comes just on time to provide Pittsburgh-area residents with top-notch sports betting news, analyses and insights into the subtler aspects of the business.</p>
<p>Combining Industry Insight with Pop Culture</p>
<p>Follow the Money is hosted by Paul Howard and Mitch Moss out of Circa Resort and Casino where VSiN runs a dedicated studio. The show focuses on both the more analytical part of the betting experience but similarly offers a leisurely breakdown of the major American leagues and developments.</p>
<p>Anecdotes, casual palaver and deep dives with various guests flesh out sports contest and make those watching feel more engaged. Guests from all realms of sports and the gambling industry are often welcome to share their own stories, with sportsbook executives, professional athletes, and media experts all flocking to Circa Resort and Casino to exchange opinions.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with AT&amp;T Pittsburgh to further expand VSiN’s distribution footprint in one of the fastest growing sports betting markets in the country,” said VSiN CEO and founder Brian Musburger.</p>
<p>Burger is happy to see his organization further build on existing partnerships with the regional sports network as well. More importantly, the new tie-up goes to show that interest in sports wagering is mounting. Previously, VSiN signed a partnership with BetMGM aimed at bringing more relevant sports betting coverage online.</p>
