<p>The long-anticipated White Paper was finally published on Thursday, April 27. The 300-page paper touched on various aspects of the gambling industry in the United Kingdom and outlined a path to improving standards across the board to the benefit of the consumer. Yet, those who have been advocating for a safer gambling industry in the build-up to the publication, and for years before that, have now spoken up, arguing that the gambling reform in the United Kingdom can set out to achieve and do more.</p>
<p>To be precise, the White Paper is only a consultation which means that it will seek evidence and input before the country’s regulatory gambling framework is overhauled to reflect those changes. Yet, there are still some concerns that the White Paper and any ensuing changes may not go far enough, as confirmed by several charities and consumer-focused organizations that have welcomed the publication but pointed out to what they see as shortcomings of the paper.</p>
<p>Gambling with Lives calls for immediate action to reduce gambling-related suicide</p>
<p>Ban all gambling advertisement</p>
<p>Trigger checks at £100 monthly losses</p>
<p>The most poignant criticism comes from Gambling with Lives, an organization that has long criticized the lack of action and the fact that gambling addiction pushes people to dark ends, including suicide. The organization supports families bereaved by gambling-related suicide and has pitched several ways to improve the consultation.</p>
<p>According to Gambling with Lives, affordability checks should start at £100 monthly losses and all gambling advertising should be suspended altogether. The organization claims that up to 1.4m people are addicted to gambling and that another 500 people die at their own hands in the United Kingdom because of gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>Gambling with Lives Co-founder Charles Ritchie MBE said that the organization’s proposals must be taken seriously as they are the only real way to reduce deaths caused by gambling. "We welcome the government finally acting, but nothing has changed yet. We desperately need the Gambling Commission to enact these reforms and not drag their feet," Gambling with Lives Strategy Director Will Prochaska said.</p>
<p>Epic Risk Management says more emphasis should be put on prevention</p>
<p>Using the statutory levy funds efficiently</p>
<p>Prevention should be a focus</p>
<p>Another organization to speak up on the matter is EPIC Risk Management, which has been helping protect consumers by launching collaborative projects with established organizations from within the sector. EPIC has already confirmed that it is looking to work with the UK Gambling Commission and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in order to assist the two in building a robust framework focused on consumer protection.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management CEO Paul Buck, though, cautions that the White Paper is just a consultation and with that, it could take two or three years more before any real measures are introduced. The process should lead to the creation of a safer gambling industry in the country.</p>
<p>"We particularly welcome the suggestion of differentiation of stakes on online slots for under 25s and provide further safeguards for the youngest members of society once they are legally allowed to bet – it is a step in the right direction," Buck noted, but he is also pointing out some important aspects of the White Paper that need to be addressed effectively.</p>
<p>One is how the money raised through a new statutory levy* would be distributed. Buck argues that the success of the levy would depend on whether those funds are directed in the most effective way possible and sent to organizations that create the most impact.</p>
<p>Another matter is whether the White Paper is missing out on "prevention." He argues that while treatment and research are crucial, it would be a "false economy" to overlook the importance of prevention front and center. EPIC is well-versed in helping prevent gambling-related harm, and the organization has been working with various stakeholders to amass sufficient expertise on the matter that can now be put to good use during the period of consultation.</p>
<p>Regardless, Buck and EPIC said that there are plenty of details to iron out before the UK can achieve its end goal of forging a safer gambling industry for all.</p>
<p>*The statutory levy refers to a new tax on gambling companies’ revenues that would be distributed to treat gambling disorders and advance research and understanding of problem gambling in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>GambleAware welcomes the idea of a statutory levy</p>
<p>Supports the introduction of statutory levy</p>
<p>Timely implementation important</p>
<p>Do more to protect children online</p>
<p>GambleAware has welcomed the arrival of the Gambling White Paper, describing it as a step in the right direction. The organizaiton said that it was encouraging to see clear commitments to making the gambling industry a safer place, as well as build a sustainable and transparent model that offers strong consumer protections.</p>
<p>"This is a substantial package of measures. In particular, we whole-heartedly support the introduction of a statutory levy on the gambling industry to ensure sustainable and transparent funding for research, education, and treatment," said GambleAware CEO Zoë Osmond.</p>
<p>Osmond explained that the White Paper has been delayed several times over already and that what’s next is for consultations and implementation to happen swiftly. She reminded that the right regulation would be needed to protect consumers and argued that 45% of all 11-17-year-olds are currently exposed to gambling products on social media every week, citing research GambleAware conducted.</p>
<p>Exposure to gambling at such an early age could influence children’s participation in gambling at later stages of life. Osmond also described gambling harm as a serious public health issue that led to greater social and health inequalities. GambleAware would continue to play a part in the collective efforts alongside the government to make the industry a safer place.</p>
<p>NHS clinic doctor says White Paper falls short</p>
<p>White Paper needs to do more about "mobile Las Vegas"</p>
<p>In an OP article for The Guardian, a prominent media outlet in the United Kingdom, Dr Matt Gaskell argues that the Gambling White Paper fails to address certain aspects of what leads to addiction.</p>
<p>He claims that people will suffer as the government "delays" the implementation of changes because of unnecessary consultations. In Gaskells’ opinion, there is already enough evidence provided to the government to mandate an immediate action rather than undergo more delays during which in his words, gambling companies would continue to make huge profits as people suffer and die.</p>
<p>"Affordability checks will only kick in if someone loses £1,000 in 24 hours and are still being consulted on," writes Gaskell in the OP. He blasts this suggestion as a UK household’s disposable income a month is only around £500. He notes that most of the people who check in at the clinic start with sports and bingo but are then pushed into online casino games – something he argues the White Paper has failed to address.</p>
<p>According to Gaskell some of the changes make sense and must be implemented without delay, such as the introduction of a £2 per spin and the reduction of the speed of play.</p>
<p>"The white paper acknowledges that gambling is harmful to health and must be regulated, but the government seems to struggle to understand that gambling harm and addiction is not the product of a minority of flawed, weak, vulnerable people," Gaskell further adds. He similarly argues that the "responsible gambling" campaigns and messaging are not efficient and need to be national public health campaigns instead.</p>
<p>"When the fun stops, stop" and "take time to think," Gaskell says, are no more than empty gestures.</p>
