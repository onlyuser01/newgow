<p>Premium online and mobile casino games supplier and aggregator iSoftBet has signed a new content agreement with the Scandinavian betting operator Coolbet.</p>
<p>Coolbet Inks a Deal with iSoftBet</p>
<p>The deal will see iSoftBet providing its new partner with a wide variety of exciting slot game offerings. Some of them include iSoftBet’s most popular picks, such as Golden Buffalo Double Up, Moriarty Megaways, and Wild Hammer Megaways.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Coolbet will integrate iSoftBet’s aggregation services, which include over 8,000 titles, developed by 85 different studios.</p>
<p>Coolbet’s head of casino and games, Patrik Backlund, spoke about the important content partnership. He is happy to welcome iSoftBet as the operator’s partner and to offer its pioneering slot products to the various Coolbet audiences across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Coolbet is currently available in several North European countries, as well as some outside countries in other continents. Those include Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Peru.</p>
<p>Backlund continued by saying that the globally recognized state-of-the-art Megaways products of iSoftBet will be a great addition to Coolbet’s offerings. He believes that their imaginative themes are something that truly sets them apart from other slots games and is thrilled to have them on Coolbet’s platform. Backlund concluded that he’s excited to work with iSoftBet and see “what the future has in store” for them.</p>
<p>ISoftBet’s Vision of Reaching New Markets</p>
<p>ISoftBet’s head of business development, Lars Kollind, is also looking forward to partnering with Coolbet. Kollind mentioned that the betting operator is one of the brands that best illustrate iSoftBet’s own core values and as such is a great choice of a partner.</p>
<p>“Coolbet has built its reputation as an up-and-coming operator and we can’t wait to see how the relationship between our brands materializes,” Kollind said.</p>
<p>ISoftBet is a reputable industry powerhouse with numerous partnerships across the 20 regions where it’s active. The company has been doubling down on its efforts to expand its presence with several deals that have opened new markets to it.</p>
<p>In summer 2021, iSoftBet received a supplier license for the Greek market, allowing the aggregator to provide its offerings to the local casinos and operators. In August, iSoftBet signed a monumental deal with Universal Soft that saw the betting products provider expand to several countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru.</p>
<p>ISoftBet has signed other content partnerships this year, some of which include LeoVegas in Italy, Jokerstar in Germany, Sellatuparley in Latin America and DoradoBet in Peru.</p>
