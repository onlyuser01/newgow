<p>Betfred, a British gambling company, has successfully expanded its agreement with the English Rugby League. The deal will see the operator as the main partner of the league’s men’s, women’s and wheelchair national teams.</p>
<p>Betfred Extends Rugby Deal</p>
<p>The deal extension will cover the next two years of professional rugby and will come with an immediate effect. Notably, the agreement will cover the 2022 Rugby League World Cup, one of the most important events in professional rugby. The tournament is scheduled for this fall and will take place in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The renewed partnership will begin on June 18. It comes right in time for the faceoff between England’s men and the Combined Nations All Stars. The event will take place at the Halliwell Jones Stadium and will also see England’s women play against the French. On the following day, England’s wheelchair team will play against France at the Manchester Basketball Centre.</p>
<p>Betfred has long supported the sport. In fact, the company’s commitment dates to 2017. At first, the operator served as the title sponsor of the Super League. With time, the operator grew its investment in professional rugby and it now has agreements with the Championship, League 1 and the Women’s Super League.</p>
<p>Betfred’s decision to expand its deal with the men’s, women’s and wheelchair teams attests to its long-term commitment to the Rugby League and professional rugby as a whole.</p>
<p>Rimmer Is Happy to Have Betfred Around</p>
<p>The owner and chief executive officer of Betfred, Fred Done, said that his company is happy with the successful partnership it has built with the Rugby League. He is glad to see how far this partnership has come since 2017. Because of that, Done feels that it is only natural to deepen this commitment and continue supporting the three England teams in the league.</p>
<p>Rugby League is such an inclusive sport and it’s a great honor for us to be involved at all levels, as we look forward to the country getting behind England Rugby League. Fred Done, CEO, Betfred</p>
<p>Ralph Rimmer, CEO of the Rugby Football League, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He thanked Betfred for being such an “outstanding sponsor” for the last five years. Rimmer shared that he was glad to have Betfred around during the turbulent pandemic times and is glad to be able to continue working with the operator.</p>
<p>They are a proud English company with roots in the north, and let’s hope we can celebrate the partnership with England teams reaching all three World Cup Finals in Manchester on the weekend of 18-19 November. Ralph Rimmer, CEO, Rugby Football League</p>
<p>A month ago, Betfred was involved in legal trouble for not paying out a player’s prize. The company was eventually forced to pay out $3 million to the person whose winnings it withheld.</p>
