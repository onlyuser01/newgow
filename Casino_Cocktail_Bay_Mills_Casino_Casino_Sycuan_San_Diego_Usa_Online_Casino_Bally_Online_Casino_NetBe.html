<p>NetBet, one of the most prominent iGaming casino and sports brands in Italy, has further strengthened its content portfolio in the country by striking a new alliance with ESA Gaming. The alliance is intended to significantly bolster the company’s market presence through the addition of new forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has been working hard on deploying a portfolio that focuses on lightweight gaming that has an added value for operators running their business in regions that lack the best gaming infrastructure but also while emphasizing on gamification and engagement.</p>
<p>As a result, ESA Gaming has come up with the EasySwipe game library which is a 360-degree solution bringing advanced and worthwhile gaming solutions that will now be incorporated with NetBet Italy’s own portfolio of titles and presented as part of the company’s available titles.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has developed a number of signature games that are collectively welcomed by gaming audiences all across Europe, and well beyond. Titles such as Joker Poker, Egyptian Reels, and Fruit Staxx have along established their presence in the iGaming space and have become known and preferred titles owing to immersive gameplay and captivating themes.</p>
<p>NetBet Italy PR Manager Claudia Georgevici has welcomed this opportunity and said that the operator was indeed excited to have the opportunity to add to what is already shaping up to be a robust portfolio. She added:</p>
<p>We are delighted to collaborate with ESA Gaming and introduce their thrilling games to our Italian players.</p>
<p>Georgevici was similarly convinced that the games added by ESA Gaming through the EasySwipeportfolio will find a strong reception among the operator’s player bases. The partnership was similarly hailed by ESA Gaming Head of Marketing Thomas Smallwood who noted that this was the latest expansion with a prominent company and a testimony to the hard work that has gone in-house to make outstanding products.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has been growing its presence with well-known and established operators beyond NetBet Italy. The company recently signed another content alliance with Videoslots, a prominent and respected operator of casino gaming products.</p>
