    <h1>Winstar Online Casino Login Buffalo Casino Games War Horse Casino New Las Vegas Casino Casino Joe Pe</h1>

<p>Dear Jörg,</p>
<p>we have checked your case once again. Let us address it step by step and you will find the requested game logs attached.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your account came to our attention after you have claimed our limited edition "Bear" bonus 20 times in a row without any intention of playing your funds, only withdrawing winnings from free spins. As per terms and conditions, the deposit needs to be wagered at least twice. Even we do have full right to confiscate any winnings from bonus abuse, we notified you about the rules and after you have wagered the needed amount, all your winnings were paid (2020.42 EUR altogether). Any story about pokies2go not paying out or seeking reasons not to pay out is false as we even paid you out after the first bonus abuse attempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.Regarding disputed winnings of 641.13€ you will find the requested game log attached. We have checked with the Wazdan game provider regarding the volatility of your game session ( Wazdan offers 3 volatility levels and they have confirmed you were playing on the highest volatility level - Black Hawk Deluxe game). Right after the win, you have changed bet and volatility level to a lower one (Twin Joker). The game log will confirm our statement and it is a direct breach of the terms and conditions you have agreed upon signing up:</p>
<p>9.8. If a player or a group of players abuses casino bonuses, Pokies2go has the right to confiscate winnings from them and to close the player accounts. Abusive behavior towards bonuses and / or bonus abuse means:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>i) A player places bets and / or stakes in the amount of the maximum allowable bonus per bonus condition in order to increase the variance and increase the balance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ii) The player lowers the stake and / or stake size after a large win and changes the game to a game with less volatility. "</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also please note that as per T&amp;C: 9.14. Bonuses offered by pokies2go.com are solely intended for genuine recreation of players only. Bonus/Promotional abuse will not be tolerated. Player betting patterns and activity are constantly monitored and in case of bonus abuse, pokies2go.com reserves the right at its sole and exclusive discretion to cancel, suspend or terminate any player account found guilty of bonus/promotional abuse as well as void/revoke any pending gaming activity and refund the original deposit, or in cases of serious and intentional abuses such decision being made on sole and exclusive discretion of Pokies2go.com to confiscate that deposit and all winnings made from it. pokies2go.com can also decide at its own discretion to ban any player from participating in pokies2go.com promotions for a definite or indefinite period of time as decided by pokies2go.com management.</p>
<p>As you clearly broke terms and conditions, we consider this case to be closed. Please note we have 0 tolerance for bonus abusers who represent a direct threat to our casino and all legitimate players. If the Casino Guru dispute team has any more questions, we will gladly answer, but the decision is final.</p>
<p>PS - disputed deposit starts at 21.02.2021 08:07:19 our system time (CSV attached with full data alongside screenshot for easier understanding of data provided). Full game log was sent to the player and to kristina.s@casino.guru . Let us know if you need it delivered anywhere else.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
