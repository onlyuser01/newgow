    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Location Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel Altantic City Casinos Top R</h1>

<p>Dear Евтим,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding the Application form. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„Play smart!</p>
<p>Winbet, in turn, gives its players the opportunity to restrict access to their account at www.winbet.bg , and for this purpose it is necessary to fill out an application for deactivation.</p>
<p>An application for deactivation can be obtained by contacting our staff member by chat or email support@winbet.com .</p>
<p>You can deactivate your account for one of the following periods: 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, or indefinite.</p>
<p>The application you will receive from our associate must be printed and hand-filled and signed by the account owner. After completing the application, you can submit it via your registered email to support@winbet.com. The photo must be clear and legible. The file must have a .jpg / .png extension and must not exceed 6 MB.</p>
<p>The term for consideration of the application is up to 30 calendar days from the date of sending.</p>
<p>If you apply for deactivation and re-access your account within these 30 calendar days, the deactivation application will be automatically canceled and you will not be able to request a new one within the next 30 days.</p>
<p>After your application has been reviewed by our staff, you will receive a confirmation email.</p>
<p>When completing the application, if you select one of the above periods, your account will be deactivated for that period, and you will not be able to activate your account before it expires. At the end of the period, your account will be automatically activated.</p>
<p>If you select the "indefinite time" option or do not select any of the fields listed in the declaration, your account will be deactivated without a deadline. To activate it in such cases, you need to contact us via online chat, phone +359 700 50 800 or email support@winbet.com , and you need to state that you want to activate the account. Our staff may require you to provide personal information or an identity document in order to establish your identity."</p>
<p>I have checked the forwarded Application and can confirm that you've requested "indefinite time period" and stated clearly that the reason for it is gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The Application has been signed on the 5th of April 2022. Could you please advise when you deposited funds into your account afterward?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
