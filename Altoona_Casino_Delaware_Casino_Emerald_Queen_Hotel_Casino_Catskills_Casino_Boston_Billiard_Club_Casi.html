<p>Nevada’s gaming regulator reported a 3.1% decline in gambling revenue while sports betting climbed up by 5.5%. This is the second time in a row that Nevada lost GGR in the gambling segment.</p>
<p>Gambling Revenue Collapses throughout Most of Nevada for November</p>
<p>Sports betting in Nevada continues to climb up consistently, even though November brought a slight hit to overall gaming revenue. Meanwhile, for the nth time, sportsbooks managed to book a record total handle.</p>
<p>Yet, a 3.1% decline in overall gambling revenue was sufficient to prompt the Gaming Control Board (GCB) to grumble about its fortunes and register a dip in performance. That had been the second month in a row gross gaming revenue (GGR) in the state shrunk as opposed to pursuing growth as a good state would do.</p>
<p>The dip affected The Las Vegas Strip and its familiar dwellers, with revenue plunging to $517.9 million out of a total $937.4 million collected from participants. Different regions posted different stories, but perhaps none more dispiriting than South Lake Tahoe, where revenue dropped by 19% to $13.8 million.</p>
<p>Conversely, Reno only saw a modest 1.3% decline to $50.3 million, but the city has always been a sort of an escapist Las Vegas heaven for those who aren’t as fond of the constantly huffing and puffing desert gambling Mecca.</p>
<p>Yet, for Southern Nevada, and specifically Mesquite and Clark County, things did look up, with gambling revenue inching up modestly.</p>
<p>Sports Betting in Nevada for November Climbs Up</p>
<p>Despite strong headwinds, the Silver State had its reasons to be content with certain developments. For starters, sports fans rallied to wager $614.1 million on football and basketball, with a few other games in the bag.</p>
<p>Moreover, these numbers constituted a 5.5% overall increase, plus it was a new record. The second-best number posted by Nevada sportsbooks sits at $597.7 million last March, with collegiate basketballs dominating headlines.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall performance throughout the year – and specifically the first 11 months – sports betting wagers amounted to $4.7 billion, or a 6.7% increased compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Interest in sports has been consolidating, but other popular segments had crashed. Baccarat revenue slipped at a heady rate stopping at $77.5 million or 22.7% decline. There was none of the appreciation James Bond would have had for Baccarat in November, not in Nevada at least, with the total wagered falling to $557 million or a 30.8% decrease.</p>
<p>Table games as a whole took a modest but palpable 3.5% hit. Meanwhile, slots managed to notch up a 1.3% increase. Having long been the backbone of many gaming industries, slot machines didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>In fact, over the past 24 months, slots only took two small hits, but have been growing like clockwork with what is an almost negligible but reassuring pace.</p>
