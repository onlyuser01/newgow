    <h1>Caesars Casino Atlantic City Prairies Edge Casino Mn Rivers Casino Ny Vegas Gems Sweepstakes Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Alvaro,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.joocasino.com/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"Users from the following countries and their territories ("Restricted Countries") are not allowed to deposit and play real money games: United States of America, United Kingdom, Spain, France and its overseas territories (Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, Mayotte, St. Martin, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, New Caledonia), Israel, Netherlands, Dutch West Indies, Curacao, Lithuania, Gibraltar, Jersey. The Casino cannot guarantee successful processing of withdrawals or refunds in the event that player breaches this Restricted Countries policy."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Alvaro, I would like to ask you to confirm, that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account. Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. Have you accumulated any winnings or you’ve lost your deposit?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards, Petronela</p>
