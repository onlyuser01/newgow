    <h1>Online Casino Best Casino Los Angeles Casino Aztar Maximillion Casino Louisiana Casino Resorts Parip</h1>

<p>Pariplay is happy to expand its relationship with Caesars Entertainment following their fruitful New Jersey-facing deal</p>
<p>The dynamic iGaming innovator and aggregator Pariplay has negotiated a deal to provide Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino’s Ontario business with content. The former company, a NeoGames subsidiary, will power Caesars with games from its proprietary Wizard Games studio.</p>
<p>As agreed, Wizard Games content is now available with Caesars in Ontario. As a result, Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino players in Ontario can now enjoy a vast variety of content, including many hits, such as Gods of Kemet, Spirit of Mustang and Wolf riches among others.</p>
<p>Under the agreement between Caesars and Pariplay, more content will be integrated into the operator’s platform in the future. The additional content will hit the market in the next few months and will also include games from third-party providers.</p>
<p>The integration follows a similar New Jersey-oriented agreement the two companies signed earlier this year. It is in line with Pariplay’s goal to expand its presence in North America.</p>
<p>Pariplay is an ambitious aggregator that hopes to maintain and expand its presence while delivering premium content to operators. Its Pariplay Fusion platform currently encompasses more than 14,000 games from over a hundred suppliers. The Fusion platform also offers a selection of back-office conversion and retention tools, such as Fusion Tournaments, Raffle Rocket and Spin that Wheel.</p>
<p>Pariplay Is Glad to Expand Its Relationship with Caesars</p>
<p>Representatives of the companies involved in the deal commented on the agreement with Caesars Digital’s SVP of iGaming, Matthew Sunderland, praising Pariplay for its impressive collection of content. He said that Caesars is excited to share these games with players in Ontario. Sunderland concluded that the integration is sure to benefit Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Wizard Games’ managing director, Joey Hortado, said that his team feels privileged to stand at the vanguard of Pariplay’s integrations and make a foray into a new region. Hortado is certain that his studio’s games will resonate with players across North America and said that he is looking forward to hearing the reactions of Ontarian players.</p>
<p>Lastly, Shivan Patel, VP of North America for Pariplay, said that his company will continue its strides in the NA region.</p>
<p>We continue to make progress in the North American market and this launch marks the latest significant achievement, as we strive to offer a content portfolio that is honed to the preferences of players in the region. Shivan Patel, VP of NA, Pariplay</p>
<p>Patel noted that the New Jersey partnership with Caesars has already demonstrated the reliability of the operator as a partner.</p>
