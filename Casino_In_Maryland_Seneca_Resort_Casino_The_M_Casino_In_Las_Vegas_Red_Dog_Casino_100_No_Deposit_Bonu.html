    <h1>Casino In Maryland Seneca Resort Casino The M Casino In Las Vegas Red Dog Casino 100 No Deposit Bonu</h1>

<p>I initiated a withdrawal of €5,000 on 30th October, and since then I've not heard anything from the casino.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to file another case, but I'm tired of waiting. I've done everything within my power to get any information, but beyond the copy&amp;paste messages from customer service, I'm left in the dark.</p>
<p>I've been told the "relevant department" is working on my case and yes, I've experienced this problem before. I held out hope that this time I'd be fortunate—after all, other users on this forum had larger withdrawals processed in just 3 days !! But with me, nothing nada!!</p>
<p>I believe they don't want to payout the sum of €5,000. I didn't use a bonus, I turned a €25 deposit into €5,000, as well as making significant other deposits over time!</p>
<p>I'm lodging this complaint so that other players can see how I'm being treated.</p>
<p>Casino Guru, please assist me as you did last time. I'm disappointed, frustrated, and feel abandoned. Saturday, the support staff shamelessly lied to me, promising an email to Christophfrick3@gmail.com–my username on the site is Barneygumble1337–but NOTHING COMES.</p>
<p>I'm left with no information, only false promises from the support staff. I've heard their copy&amp;paste script so often that I could probably work there as a side job....</p>
<p>This is a sad tale, particularly as it keeps happening to me. Am I the only one experiencing this?</p>
<p>I am desperate, and I am seeking aid. Casino Guru, you guys are amazing!</p>
<p>Attached is further proof that no action has been taken to support me. As of 30th October, the status is indicated as "PENDING", which I can only understand as "We're not doing anything", how else should I interpret it...</p>
<p>I'm so grateful for all the help you provide to people like me and others, you guys deserve a massive shout out, you are amazing, please keep going!</p>
<p>I had to insert the screenshot within the text as I couldn't upload attachments.</p>
<p>All the best for your day,</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Barney</p>
