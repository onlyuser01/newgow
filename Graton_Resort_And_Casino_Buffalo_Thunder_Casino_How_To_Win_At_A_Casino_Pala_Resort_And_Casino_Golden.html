    <h1>Graton Resort And Casino Buffalo Thunder Casino How To Win At A Casino Pala Resort And Casino Golden</h1>

<p>Following its decision to elect Matthew Kelemen as its business development director for North America in order to reinforce its regional presence, innovative iGaming content provider and aggregator Pariplay Ltd continues to make waves. The Aspire Global brand has closed a distribution deal that will see its content made available via Sportingtech’s Quantum platform.</p>
<p>Large Portfolio Offered to Wide Operator Network</p>
<p>Sportingtech, a full-service betting and gaming platform provider, will gain access to Pariplay’s Fusion suite, including content from more than 70 high-profile industry suppliers with an established reputation and sizable gaming portfolios.</p>
<p>Pariplay brings a distinct variety of over 12,000 iGaming titles that are readily available to its partners through the Fusion aggregation platform. The company also delivers on advanced back-office solutions that boost retention, enhance player value, and deliver on a variety of engagement tools such as tournaments and raffles.</p>
<p>Pariplay is committed to building up its presence in the European and Latin American iGaming markets. The company already has a strong foothold in those regions and enjoys a wide operator network that has been established by the platform provider.</p>
<p>Mutual Satisfaction on Both Sides of the Aisle</p>
<p>Pariplay VP of sales Andrew Maclean commented that the deal “makes perfect sense” as he went on to praise Quantum, which, according to him, is a top-notch platform with a strong presence in key regions, which will allow for the continual growth of Fusion.</p>
<p>Sportingtech CEO Ivo Doroteia also commented on the deal, noting that Pariplay’s content portfolio will strengthen its own offering with even more value for its partners. Quantum covers over 65 sports across 1,000 betting markets, while at the same time offering a casino portfolio of more than 9000 games by harnessing scalable, modular software tailored to suit various markets.</p>
<p>Aspire Global, the parent brand that owns Pariplay, has been fully focused on the B2B segment, resulting in stronger financial performance. The company acquired the game aggregator in 2019 and has used it to steer its transition towards the business-to-business sector, leaving business-to-customer partnerships in the past.</p>
<p>The addition of Pariplay and BtoBet and the present bidding for NeoGames have allowed Aspire Global to gain access to tier-one gaming operators over the past three years. Aspire recently landed its full-stack platform to WIN Group, to boost the esports betting platform’s foray into new verticals of the iGaming experience.</p>
