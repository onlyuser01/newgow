<p>Diamonds of Egypt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Diamonds of Egypt is an Ancient-Egyptian-themed slot from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The gameâ€™s story is based around a female adventurer that is on the quest for the titular diamonds that are lost deep in the Egyptian desert.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Aesthetically, Diamonds of Egypt sticks to a very generic design. The reels are placed in the middle of the desert, with some hazy sand floating around as you play. The pyramids and the sphinx are in the background, appearing as symbols on the reels. Other symbols include a ring, a goblet, and a new female explorer character.</p>
<p>The soundtrack also sticks closely to what you would expect from an Egyptian slot, making little effort to differentiate itself from other titles in the genre. The graphics style is similar to that which Pragmatic Play used in Kingdom of the Dead, another slot with a similar theme released around the same month.</p>
<p>Big win in the Diamonds of Egypt slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Diamonds of Egypt sticks to a fairly conventional set-up found in most top online slots. It has five reels, each with three symbols. Winning combinations are formed when symbols land across adjacent reels, allowing for 243 ways to win.</p>
<p>The control panel is found under the reels, with players being able to use the autospin option if they want to let the game do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are just a few bonus features on offer in Diamonds of Egypt. The first thing you should be aware of is the Multiplier Wild symbol. This only appears on reel three, and it always carries a multiplier of x5.</p>
<p>Landing a standard Wild on any spin can trigger the Jackpot Bonus Game. There are four jackpots available: Mini, Minor, Major, and Grand. These pay out 10x, 100x, 20x, and 1,000x your stake, respectively. To win the jackpots, you will need to match three pots with their respective names in a bonus round.</p>
<p>The other bonus is the Free Spins round. This triggers when you land three or more Scatter symbols. Players are given eight spins. During the round, all of the lower-paying symbols are removed from the grid. Three or more Scatters on adjacent reels, starting on the leftmost reel, will trigger eight more spins.</p>
<p>Diamonds of Egypt has the x5 multiplier Wild symbol on the middle reel</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Diamonds of Egypt slot serves up a maximum win of 2,500x your stake. This is won in the free spins, and the game will immediately end if won. This is not a huge amount compared to some other titles in the genre.</p>
<p>However, the RTP in the game is impressive, coming in at 96.49%, which is above average and would fit in with our slot strategy. The slot has been given 4/5 for volatility from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The slot has some strange betting options. You can adjust the coin size, bet level, and total bet by clicking on the +/- buttons around the spin button. The minimum bet is $0.88, and the maximum is $140.80.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Diamonds of Egypt slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Egyptian-themed slots are everywhere, so it takes a lot to make one stand out. Unfortunately, Diamonds of Egypt does very little to achieve that. It has a fairly standard design, and the bonus features can all be found in other, more engaging slots. The jackpot prize of 1,000x is fairly underwhelming, and the maximum win of 2,500x is not spectacular. On the whole, this is a slot that will almost definitely be forgotten in the sands of time.</p>
