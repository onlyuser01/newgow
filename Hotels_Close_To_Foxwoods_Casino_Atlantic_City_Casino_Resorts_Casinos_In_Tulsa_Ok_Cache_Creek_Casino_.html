<p>People who stop on one of the Vegas Strip’s pedestrian bridges for any reason will risk misdemeanor charges, a $1,000 fine and up to six months in prison</p>
<p>The recent F1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix 2023 saw the Las Vegas government introduce a variety of tourist and citizen-unfriendly measures. While some were only temporary solutions to protect the racers, some seem to be here to stay.</p>
<p>In November, local lawmakers introduced a measure that would ban pedestrians from stopping on the Vegas Strip’s multiple pedestrian bridges. While no one believed the measure would pass, the Clark County Commission voted in favor of the restriction.</p>
<p>As a result, people who stop on one of the Vegas Strip’s pedestrian bridges for any reason, risk misdemeanor charges, a $1,000 fine and up to six months in prison. This doesn’t only apply to the bridges themselves but to the vicinity of the stairways, escalators and elevators as well.</p>
<p>The original measure applied to all people standing still but thankfully, an amendment fixed the rule so that people waiting for the elevators and escalators do not risk charges.</p>
<p>The argument in favor of the measure is that big events often cause congestion of people that can expose people to the dangers of terrorism and prevent authorities and emergency personnel from accessing and crossing the bridges easily.</p>
<p>The police, for example, have trouble crossing the pedestrian bridges to maintain order during such events, which is why proponents of the measure believe that it is necessary.</p>
<p>However, during most of the year, the measure will prevent water sellers and artists from doing business on the bridges. It would also prevent people from taking photos of the Strip.</p>
<p>Once a reality, the restriction will be communicated to pedestrians via signs at the affected sites.</p>
<p>The Measure Will Result in Litigation, Opponents Believe</p>
<p>As one can imagine, a lot of people are unhappy with the measure, which they believe is unconstitutional. According to Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, no one who supports the First Amendment should support this measure.</p>
<p>Haseebullah added that if the measure passes, it will surely result in litigation. He slammed the “buzzwords” which seek to make the measure appeal less restrictive than it actually is. Despite that, the Clark County Commission was far more inclined to accept the narrative that this measure would protect the safety of pedestrians.</p>
<p>However, the commission has no start date for the new regulation as of yet.</p>
