<p>Home Favorites Face Tough Challenges in Top Week 7 NFL Matchups</p>

<p>The top games on the Week 7 NFL slate all feature home favorites, but none of them have been given easy assignments, as capable visiting teams are coming in with plenty to play for.</p>

<p>That starts with an early game in Green Bay, where the 5-1 Packers are 4.5-point favorites over the visiting Oakland Raiders (3-2), according to DraftKings Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Mahomes Injury Opens Door for Oakland</p>
<p>The Raiders may not have come into the season with a lot of hype, but they’ve won two straight, including a 24-21 victory over the Bears last Sunday. And with an injury to Pat Mahomes potentially leaving the Chiefs vulnerable, Oakland might be primed to play themselves back into the AFC West race – or at least set themselves up as a leading wild card contender.</p>
<p>Of course, to do that, they’ll first have to find a way to slow down Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, something Raiders head coach Jon Gruden admits is no easy task.</p>
<p>“His magnificent scrambling, creating offense is uncommon,” Gruden told reporters on Wednesday. “It’s just unbearable to watch. I hate watching this guy: he’s fun to watch, but he’s really not fun to watch when you got to play against him.”</p>
<p>In late afternoon action, the Baltimore Ravens (4-2) travel to Seattle (5-1), with the Seahawks rated as a three-point favorite. The Ravens should be bolstered a bit by the addition of cornerback Marcus Peters, who was acquired from the Los Angeles Rams earlier in the week. Peters has graded out as one of the best corners in the league over the past few seasons, and Ravens head coach John Harbaugh is excited to get him on the field against an explosive Seahawks offense.</p>
<p>“He’s looked great. He’ll play a lot,” Harbaugh told reporters. “Our coaches have done a great job of getting him up to speed.”</p>
<p>Week 7 Schedule Features Key NFC Matchups</p>
<p>Also in the late afternoon slot, the New Orleans Saints (5-1) will head into Chicago as four-point underdogs against the Bears (3-2). The Saints have remained near the top of the NFL standings despite losing star quarterback Drew Brees, while the Bears have also been surprisingly good without starting QB Mitch Trubisky since losing him in Week 4.</p>
<p>While Trubisky is likely to be back in the lineup this week, Brees isn’t expected back until at least the Saints’ bye in Week 9 – though that’s not for lack of effort on his part.</p>
<p>Knowing Drew, you have to understand, he’s one of those upbeat, optimistic guys that is going to do everything during that 24-hour day that helps him to come back as fast as he can when he’s ready,” Saints coach Sean Payton told Brett Favre in an interview earlier this week.</p>
<p>Finally, the nightcap features the Dallas Cowboys hosting the Philadelphia Eagles in a battle of 3-3 NFC East teams. Right now, that mark is good enough for a share of the divisional lead, meaning both teams will be looking to pick up a critical win to go out in front of the pack as the season nears its midpoint.</p>
<p>Dallas is on a three-game losing streak – including a loss to the previously winless Jets last week – but still come into the matchup as a 2.5-point favorite over the Eagles.</p>
