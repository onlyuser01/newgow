    <h1>Bettendorf Casino Station Casinos Careers Michigan Online Casinos Casinos Near Colorado Springs Casi</h1>

<p>I used Spinup Casino welcome offer back in 2019 and actually forgot I had money still deposited there.</p>
<p>The T&amp;C I agreed to in 2019 have suddenly changed, and since Spinup doesn't keep track of or has a valid from date in their T&amp;C, they seem to just keep adding more demands for you to withdraw or restrict your money. They dont either send a confirmation when you depsoit or register, so you know what "legal" demands you are bound by, so you have to already at sign up suspect that they might be unfair. But if I had known this, I would never have deposited. I only did because they were recommended by a danish gambling/slot site, who are NOT recommending them anymore (wonder why?)</p>
<p>I made a quite small deposit, but the wagering demands were 20/40x. As a player you are not able to see your wagering process/status. You will have to contact the live support every time and trust, that they give you the honest answer (throughout my playing time, these status updates were very unlikely to be true, as they seem to rise at one point after I had played on slot machines for 2 hours. Dont think they expected me to keep track with screenshots)</p>
<p>I stayes through and played through around 2000EUR, and ended up with a little over 500EUR. I have then gotten different answers to what the withdrawal process is and what I can and cannot do.</p>
<p>At first, a "Steve Manager" told me that I should just write them an email with my bank info, and some other personel documentation and I would be able to get all the money in my account.</p>
<p>Later a new employee (Couldnt keep track in the end), told me that the bonus amount (80 something EUR) were locked to the account, and if you withdraw, they are forfeited, EVEN after you have done 20/40x wagering demands. This was not part of the T&amp;C in 2019 when I signed up, but they do not have a changelog at spinup, so you are able to see the progress of or former T&amp;C documentation.</p>
<p>I have even gotten hold of an employee that told me that I was only able to withdraw 10% of the amount - Again not part of the agreed upon terms.</p>
<p>I figured some of theese employees just might not know the rules, so I just filed a request for withdrawal of 450 EUR (I already deducted the 80 something bonus). Have not heard from them at all, but logged into my account just to find that status of my request was canceled and my balance was only 19.63EUR. I have gotten a confirmation of my request, but not one when they cancelled or WHY?</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with getting through to these people and figure out what is even permitted of them to do? I have not broken any of their bonus regulations, and they have told me that I have met the wagering requirements MONTHS ago.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
