<p>Powerball Jackpot Hits $700M, Lottery Game’s Fifth-Largest Prize Ever</p>

<p>The Powerball jackpot for Wednesday night’s drawing is an estimated $700 million, which is the lottery game’s fifth-largest all-time prize. Powerball began in April 1992.</p>

<p>No ticket matched Powerball’s five white balls and red Powerball during Monday night’s drawing. The last time a ticket hit all six numbers was on August 3, when a player in Pennsylvania snagged the $206.9 million jackpot.</p>
<p>The estimated $700 million jackpot for the Wednesday, October 26 drawing comes after 35 drawings went without a ticket successfully matching all six winning numbers. Despite the winless streak, the jackpot odds for each ticket tomorrow remain a dismal one in 292.2 million.</p>
<p>If a ticket hits the jackpot on Wednesday, the lucky winner(s) will have a pre-tax lump cash option of $335.7 million. Along with cracking Powerball’s five largest jackpots ever, the $700 million prize ranks as the eighth-largest lottery jackpot in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Play Surges</p>
<p>Interest in Powerball and Mega Millions increases greatly when the jackpot climbs to such unfathomable heights. And when more players purchase $2 Powerball tickets, more six-number combinations are covered for the draw. That slightly shortens the odds of at least one ticket hitting the six balls drawn from the Powerball machines.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s drawing has already greatly exceeded sales expectations. The Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), which facilitates Powerball, initially projected the October 26 Powerball jackpot to be approximately $680 million. Because of strong sales, MUSL officials have increased the projected bounty to $700 million.</p>
<p>Each ticket has nine ways to win. On Monday night, more than 1.2 million tickets won a prize.</p>
<p>The majority — 675,217 winning tickets — simply matched the red Powerball to double their $2 bet. But 161,702 of those tickets had the optional $1 add-on Power Play that quadrupled their prize after the Power Play turned up 4x during the drawing.</p>
<p>The top prize won Monday night was a winning ticket sold in Texas that matched all five white balls to win $1 million. Other notable wins include 32 tickets that matched four white balls and the red Powerball for $50K wins. Ten other tickets also matched four white balls and the Powerball, but additionally purchased the $1 Power Play to take their wins to $200K each.</p>
<p>Five Powerball jackpots have been won this year.</p>
<p>2022 Drawing Date — Jackpot Won — Winners</p>
<p>January 5 — $632.6M — 2 (California, Wisconsin) February 14 — $185.3M — 1 (Connecticut) April 27 — $473.1M — 1 (Arizona) June 29 — $366.7M — 1 (Vermont) August 3 — $206.9M — 1 (Pennsylvania)</p>
<p>Top-10 Lottery Jackpots</p>
<p>The current Powerball jackpot has already solidified its position on the top-10 lottery jackpot list in US history. The richest lottery prize ever won came in January 2016 when three winners in California, Florida, and Tennessee shared a more than $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot.</p>
<p>The largest single win in US lottery history came via Mega Millions in October 2018 when a player in South Carolina was the lone winner of a $1.537 billion jackpot.</p>
<p>At $700 million, Wednesday’s Powerball jackpot is still less than halfway to becoming the largest lottery prize ever won in the US.</p>
