    <h1>Blue Chip Casino Hotel Horseshoe Casino Tunica Ms Branson Missouri Casinos San Manuel Casino San Ber</h1>

<p>Both the Carolina Panthers and the New York Giants have problems with injuries, particularly on offense. The Panthers will once again be without their best player, running back Christian McCaffrey.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Giants, it’s even worse. They will miss Saquon Barkley, Kadarius Toney, Kenny Golladay and Andrew Thomas in Week 7.</p>
<p>Does this mean the Giants are in trouble? It seems so, at least according to the betting odds, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>Sam Darnold Needs to Step Up</p>
<p>When McCaffrey’s on the team, the Panthers’ strongest weapon is their rushing game. Now that he’s not around, Carolina’s QB will need to step up with his passing.</p>
<p>And he really needs to up his game. Sam Darnold is the man responsible for five of Carolina’s previous six turnovers, all of which happened in the previous two weeks.</p>
<p>He was dreadful in those two games, with a completion rate of 56.76 against the Eagles and 41.46 against the Vikings.</p>
<p>The game against the Vikings was one of Darnold’s worst in his NFL career, at least when stats are concerned. However, we did see him making some impressive moves in key moments of the game. In fact, it was Darnold who threw a touchdown pass in the last minute of the regulation time, which helped his team take the game to overtime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Panthers, they ended up conceding a touchdown a couple of minutes later. Nevertheless, that’s something that’s surely giving them hope ahead of the Week 7 game. After all, Darnold and the boys will play against a much worse defense than last weekend.</p>
<p>Big Problems for the Giants All-Around</p>
<p>With 177 points conceded, the Giants are the worst team in the NFC when defending is concerned. What’s worse is that they conceded 102 in the previous two games.</p>
<p>Sure, they did face two very tough offenses – the Rams and the Cowboys. However, the fact is that their defense is among the worst in the league.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not the defense that should worry them ahead of Week 7. It’s their offense that has some really big problems at the moment.</p>
<p>The thing is that several of their key men will have to miss the next game. This includes Barkley and Golladay, who also missed the Week 6 games.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Giants, those two aren’t the only injured offensive players. In the game against the Rams, two crucial Giants players picked up an injury. One of those is Andrew Thomas, who’s probably their best tackle in 2021. The other one is WR Kadarius Toney.</p>
<p>Without those guys on the field, it seems impossible that the Giants are going to do much against the Panthers. That’s why betting on Carolina seems like the right solution.</p>
<p>Pick: Carolina Panthers to win; under should hit.</p>
