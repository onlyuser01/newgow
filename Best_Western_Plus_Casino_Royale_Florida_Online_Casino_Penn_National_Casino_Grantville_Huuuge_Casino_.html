    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale Florida Online Casino Penn National Casino Grantville Huuuge Casino</h1>

<p>The company cannot wait to welcome Nebraskan players and will therefore launch a temporary casino until its new property opens</p>
<p>Gambling giant Caesars Entertainment is preparing to foray into Nebraska with a new Harrah’s casino. The company, which announced its plans in 2021, has now shared an official visualization of the property.</p>
<p>The Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino will mark Caesars’ entry in the state. It is made possible by the company’s agreement with Columbus Exposition and Racing and will be the home of Nebraska’s longest thoroughbred racetrack.</p>
<p>The racetrack, however, will not be the only notable feature of Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino. The venue, as its title implies, will also feature a large 28,000-square-foot casino and sportsbook area. Local players can expect to find a rich selection of over 500 slots, as well as 14 gaming tables.</p>
<p>In terms of dining, Caesars’ new property will feature a bar called Wishbones, named after a beloved, now closed, event district in the city. The property will also be home to The Brew Brothers, an award-winning restaurant, popular for its fantastic beer and gourmet food. Lastly, visitors will also be able to visit a Marriot Fairfield Inn and Townplace Suites, which will be built next to the casino and will provide traveling players with a place to stay the night.</p>
<p>Caesars hopes to open Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Caesars Cannot Wait to Welcome Nebraskans</p>
<p>The operator is excited about the property’s upcoming launch. According to Joe Morris, the company’s senior vice president of racing, horse racing is an integral part of the Cornhusker State. Caesars will support locals’ passion for the sport by launching an “all-new, one-mile racetrack for the community to enjoy.”</p>
<p>During a recent event at the Elks Country Club, Caesars not only presented renderings of the casino but also saw executives talk about the company’s vision. According to Todd Connelly, Caesars Entertainment’s regional president, the construction of the new property represents a major milestone for the operator.</p>
<p>Connelly thanked all of Caesars’ partners and local community members who attended the event and said that he is looking forward to welcoming locals to Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>During the event, the Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino team also donated $5,000 to the new Columbus FIeldhouse as a sign of goodwill.</p>
<p>Nebraskans Will Get to Play Earlier than They Think</p>
<p>Although the new property is set to open in early 2024, locals will get to play with Caesars sooner as the company will open a temporary casino at AG Park. This property is scheduled to open in late spring this year and will feature 200+ slots and will be home to an expansive simulcast offering for horse racing.</p>
<p>Caesars noted that the temporary location will be part of its Caesars Rewards loyalty program, allowing loyal customers to collect points and redeem various prizes.</p>
