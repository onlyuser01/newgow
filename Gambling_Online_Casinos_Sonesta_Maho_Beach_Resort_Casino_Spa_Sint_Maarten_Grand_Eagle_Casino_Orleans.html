<p>Additional comments from the player</p>
<p>As you can see in terms of how players with gambling problems are ignored at springbok</p>
<p>ÔÑçKianaHello üòÉ You are now connected with Kiana üçÄ How may I assist you today?</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>is there a supervisor on duty I last spoke to Kwesie</p>
<p>ÔÑçKiana</p>
<p>I can certainly check on that for you.</p>
<p>May I ask the reason for you request so that I can relay the information?</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>yes illegal practices and procedures with players that have gambling addictions</p>
<p>and allowing them to deposit and not taking actions</p>
<p>still there</p>
<p>ÔÑçKiana</p>
<p>Yes I am still here</p>
<p>Please allow me a moment.</p>
<p>I will now transfer you to my superior</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Hi, welcome to Casino Support. My name is Kwesi and I'm happy to help you today.</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Hi Kwesi we spoke the other day I emailed you feedback and will forward the exclusion forms in a short while</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Yes we spoke yesterday</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>were you infact serious with regards to the email response turn around time</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Yes I was</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>2 to 3 days</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Yes Craig</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>and Im guessing new players who deposit do not get verified or monitored immediately</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>No, this rule is for everyone</p>
<p>From new players to VIP</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Im just trying to understand if I had R15000 there is a 99% chance I would of played it all out thats generally issues with gambling addicts</p>
<p>ok so thank you for confirming false information</p>
<p>because according to your websites terms and conditions</p>
<p>Springbok Casino monitors all casino games at all times. As a result, Springbok Casino has the ability to track and review each hand/roll/slot pull/spin for each player and game offered.</p>
<p>had this happened you would of picked up on deposits and the crazy amount of bonuses I claimed and tried to contact me to verify my details this wasnt done,</p>
<p>secondly, If you responded or any agent responded and took action that would mean I probably would of only lost R150 as that was the exact amount when I emailed</p>
<p>without taking action on my request I ended up spending over R600</p>
<p>given the fact that I made sure I emailed both casinos and as you say 2 to 3 days</p>
<p>All disputes should be forwarded to Springbok Casino by e-mail within one (1) hour of the disputed event.</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Our live chat service is the only way for immediate response, so sorry that you this happened to you</p>
<p>Emails takes 2 -3 business days</p>
<p>Sunday and Saturday are not included</p>
<p>Today is the second day</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>gambling addiction account closure requests must be actioned immediately</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Yes, once made aware. We were not aware until you came into chats</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>and as this was not done I expect a full refund as this casino did not follow protocal which is implemented by the gaming board</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>So sorry but we cannot refund this</p>
<p>As stated in our previous conversation</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Springbok Casino protects its players by encouraging responsible gaming and ensuring that casino action is enjoyed as pure entertainment. To further these aims Springbok Casino has implemented mechanisms and structures to help players who have problems controlling their gaming:</p>
<p>did springbok take action and locking my account on saturday where in your terms does it state 2 to 3 days</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>In our general terms and conditions, I would have to advise you to go over them completely before playing</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>and why is thunderbolt sending me offers still as I got an offer this morning</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>As these were agreed upon sign up</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>still failing to follow the correct protocal</p>
<p>Daily / Monthly deposit limits:</p>
<p>Players can contact Springbok Casino any time and set daily or monthly deposit limits.</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>You will have to send back the self exclusion form so that we're able to completely exclude you, as stated yesterday, your account is currently close though</p>
<p>Yes they can, via chats</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>so if I emailed you please set daily limits to R50 and waited 3 days for a response That means I would have lost not sure what the daily deposit amount is at the casino before actioning this</p>
<p>My argument is not regrding wheres my bonus I cant login everyday basic queries thats fine regarding 2 to 3 days</p>
<p>NOT when it comes to locking accounts due to gambling addiction</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>This is why we do advise you to our live chat service for immediate response</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>NO REGARDLESS HOW IT WAS DONE IT SHOULD OF BEEN ACTIONED</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Unfortunately that is not the case Craig</p>
<p>This is the procedure</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Thats not an excuse as if I went on the website and aw 2 to 3 days maybe you could use that excuse,</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>So sorry that you feel this way Craig</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>by not following protocol and the correct procedures and refusing the refund based on the fact that my account was not locked immediately who has a stronger case</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>Unfortunately a refund is not an option</p>
<p>ÔÑÑMe</p>
<p>Thats fine I just needed this confirmed on chat so I can update the gaming board on what you say is email turn around time and not taking action immedietly and the website saying within 1 hour</p>
<p>ÔÑçKwesi</p>
<p>I understand Craig.</p>
<p>May I assist you with anything else?</p>
