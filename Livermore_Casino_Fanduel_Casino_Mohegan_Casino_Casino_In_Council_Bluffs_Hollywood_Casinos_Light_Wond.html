    <h1>Livermore Casino Fanduel Casino Mohegan Casino Casino In Council Bluffs Hollywood Casinos Light Wond</h1>

<p>As Light &amp; Wonder continues to double down on its digital offering, it needs more experienced and trusted iGaming veterans to help steer the company towards success. This is where former CTO Steve Beason comes in. The returning industry heavyweight will assist Light &amp; Wonder in its pursuit of better market positioning and share, as he will serve as president of digital and sports betting.</p>
<p>Benefiting from Beason’s Industry-Related Experience</p>
<p>He is a long-time company insider who worked as its chief technology officer and president between 2005 and 2016. During his stint, Light &amp; Wonder managed to rebrand and systematically expand its portfolio of products along with the underpinning technology that has been behind much of the company’s success.</p>
<p>He did a short stint at Inspired Entertainment since stepping down from then-Scientific Games in 2016 and worked there as CTO, bringing some of that valuable knowledge over there. He has held another important position as VP of software at GTECH and served as CTO at The Hong Kong Jockey Club.</p>
<p>Despite his time spent with various companies and decided to move away from Light &amp; Wonder in 2016, Beason still has tons to offer and his past in the firm must have motivated him to keep helping it push the boundaries of its iLottery and sports betting markets.</p>
<p>Understandably, his return has been welcomed by Light &amp; Wonder CEO Patrick McHugh who was pleased with Beason’s decision to rejoin the team and further strengthen the technical offer of the company at a time when it’s pursuing rapid expansion.</p>
<p>McHugh argued that Beason will add immediate value to a range of important pivots at Light &amp; Wonder, including operations, content, technology, and services. He continued:</p>
<p>Under Steve’s leadership, as we continue to accelerate growth, our digital product innovation will enhance each of our existing product lines, expanding play and promotion of lottery games. Light &amp; Wonder CEO Patrick McHugh</p>
<p>Always Welcoming to New Opportunities and Innovation</p>
<p>The chief executive also talked about the broader success of the company and its most recent expansion moves. He noted that Hungary, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Denmark remain some of the most important and successful business developments where the company is delivering lottery instant games, sports betting products for retail and digital, and has further expanded the opportunities for the lottery business and consumer experiences.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has continued to grow rapidly in other segments as well. The company is assisting PlayStar Casino with its New Jersey launch. In May, Light &amp; Wonder made a bold prediction about its EBITDA reaching $1.4 billion and it introduced Konami games to its OpenGaming platform.</p>
