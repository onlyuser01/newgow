<p>Betway, the Super Group-owned betting brand, has expanded its partnership with Trustly, an advanced payment processor company that facilitates payments using global account-to-account (A2A) transactions.</p>
<p>Trustly Seeks to Innovate the Way Gamblers Deposit and Withdraw</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership, Super Group will now leverage the payment processor across its variety of brands in the United Kingdom where the partnership is focused. This reflects a broader adoption of FinTech solutions by gambling companies.</p>
<p>Recently, PayNearMe released a report that focused exclusively on the US market and found out that players are far more likely to spend more time betting or gaming if they are provided with the opportunity to deposit and withdraw with preferred and trusted gaming options.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Betway marketing and operations director Paul Adkins said that the company is chuffed to have added Trustly’s product offer. He added:</p>
<p>As open banking is becoming more popular in this country, we wanted to find a partner whose banking solutions offered our customers a seamless experience, which is important for us as one of the UK’s leading operators. Betway marketing and operations director Paul Adkins</p>
<p>Adkins confirmed that by teaming up with Trustly, the company was aiming to ensure that the banking experience players enjoyed was the best possible option. Trustly’s status in the gambling industry has been growing and the company has even powered some pay-and-play casinos which automate the registration process for players.</p>
<p>Gambling Companies Acknowledge Benefits of Trustly</p>
<p>Trustly is similarly happy to partner up with one of the most prominent players in the UK gambling market. Commenting on this link-up, Trustly VP of gaming Vasilije Lekovic offered nothing but praise about Betway’s stature in UK gambling.</p>
<p>Betway is one of the leading sports betting brands in the UK that continues introducing innovative solutions and services to its offering and we’re certain that our product will add a lot of value to their loyal customer base in this market.</p>
<p>Trustly has been similarly moving to establish itself on the UK market by teaming up with Premier League soccer club West Ham United. Trustly wants to become a go-to payment option for gamblers, sports fans, and retail consumers in the UK.</p>
<p>The company noted that there has been a perceptible shift away from traditional payment options such as bank cards and towards account-to-account payments. This trend is only going to accelerate over the coming months, Lekovic assured.</p>
<p>Lekovic believes that Trustly is in a pivot position to actually lead the adoption of this technology, as its mobile banking app uses biometric verification and is equipped with the security and convenience features to make it a preferred choice.</p>
