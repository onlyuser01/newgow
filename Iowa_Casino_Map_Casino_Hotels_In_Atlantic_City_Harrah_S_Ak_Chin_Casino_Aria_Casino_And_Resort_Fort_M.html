<p>Getting closer to the day when the lockdown will be lifted, Station Casinos will take a cautionary approach to return back to business.</p>
<p>Station Casinos Will Re-open Without an Action Plan</p>
<p>Station Casinos’ operations in Las Vegas, Nevada will not be in a hurry to re-open all of their venues. The properties that are expected to open for visitors soon are: Santa Fe, Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch, Wildfire, Sunset Station, Boulder Station and Palace Station.</p>
<p>While the company still needs to go through an assessment of the damages caused by the two-month lockdown, the venues at Fiesta Henderson, Texas Station and Palms may experience a delay before coming back to business.</p>
<p>Station Casinos’ is known to have around 14,000 employees, many of which are on temporary furlough. Even so, the company said previously that the part-time and full-time employees are to receive payment through May 16. In addition, dental and medical care were extended through September 30.</p>
<p>In a letter to Station’s employees, CEO Frank Fertitta III expressed his concern about the upcoming events. He said: “When we are permitted to reopen, we don’t know what business will look like, other than knowing that business levels will be lower as a result of this unprecedented crisis.” He continued that this has been the most difficult time that the company has seen so far.</p>
<p>Fertitta also noted that a part of the company’s workforce will be affected which can result in unemployment but did not share further details. He did not miss to mention his high hopes about the near future:</p>
<p>We are hopeful though that Las Vegas will rebound swiftly and allow us to rehire many of our values team members when we emerge on the other side of this crisis.“</p>
<p>Nevada Prepares to Come Back to Business</p>
<p>Ever since the lockdown order from March 17, many businesses suffered great losses and lots of employees were put on furlough. The gambling industry took a great hit by the novel coronavirus as well. While no report can accurately reflect the losses, if one had to guess, it would be in the hundreds of millions of lost revenues.</p>
<p>With some bitter aftertaste, business will have to try and recover from the lockdown and shake off the COVID-19 impact. The lockdown is expected to end around mid-May, as announced by Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. In ‘phase one’ of the governor’s plan, businesses such as restaurants, churches, movie theaters will re-open. Further details as to will casinos be allowed to operate are yet to be released.</p>
<p>Fertitta reassured employees that Station Casinos will assist them with obtaining unemployment benefits as well as seek help from the federal government.</p>
<p>He also expressed his hopes that Las Vegas’ returning to normal business activity would be quick, allowing Station Casinos to re-hire the majority of those who may be affected by upcoming layoffs.</p>
