<p>Patrons Left Disappointed as Gateway Casinos Close Unexpectedly</p>
<p>The Facebook statement posted on Sunday read: “All Gateway Ontario sites will close due to a system-wide malfunction until further notice.” No further information was provided on the nature of the malfunction or when the casinos would resume operations.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. on Sunday, a sudden closure of multiple locations occurred, including Casino Rama in Orillia, the Cascades Casino in Chatham, and nearby Gateway Casinos in Sarnia, London, Woodstock, and Clinton, as well as the Playtime Casino in Hanover. The duration of the closure remains unknown and the facilities will be closed until further notice.</p>
<p>The closure has left many patrons disappointed, as the Casino Rama was one of the most popular gaming destinations in Canada. The Casino Rama Resort’s hotel and Weirs restaurant, however, would remain open despite the shutdown, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Employees Left in the Dark as Gateway Casinos Remain Closed</p>
<p>The sudden shutdown of all Gateway Casinos and Entertainment properties has also raised concerns among employees. The company has not released any further statements regarding the situation, leaving many to wonder about the cause of the system-wide malfunction and the timeline for the resumption of operations.</p>
<p>Casino Rama opened its doors on July 31, 1996, and it has been continuously operating 24/7 until the pandemic shutdown in 2020.</p>
<p>Gateway Casinos and Entertainment, which operates the Casino Rama, is a major Canadian gaming and entertainment operator. It has its headquarters in Burnaby, British Columbia. With a current count of 23 casinos spread across Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, it has grown significantly since its inception.</p>
<p>The company is currently owned by The Catalyst Capital Group Inc., a private equity investment firm that started in 2002. Gateway Casinos &amp; Entertainment Limited is one of the largest and most successful casino and entertainment companies in Western Canada, employing over 3,000 employees and operating 12 facilities, a remarkable increase from its humble beginnings with only 2 facilities and 150 employees back in 1992.</p>
