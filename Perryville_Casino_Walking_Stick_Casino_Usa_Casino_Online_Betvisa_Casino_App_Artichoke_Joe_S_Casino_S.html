<p>As a world leader in the gambling industry with an unrivalled track record of success in Poker, Playtech was a natural choice as our new network provider. AdmiralBet managing director Paolo Marchi</p>
<p>Marchi spoke about the dynamic changes in the poker ecosystem over the past year and the clear commitment AdmiralBet has shown to poker. Now, though, with the help of Playtech and its iPoker solution, brands can come together and build a robust vertical.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Playtech VP of interactive gaming Marat Koss who said that AdmiralBet.it addition was an important step forward for everyone in the sector. Koss commented:</p>
<p>The past few years have seen great changes in the Poker sector, and while these have included undeniable challenges, Playtech has continued to invest in both enhancing our Poker product and extending our network. Playtech VP of interactive gaming Marat Koss</p>
<p>Koss added that AdmiralBet is an established leader in Italy and the company is stoked to have the opportunity to build on the existing poker ecosystem together. Playtech has seen strong growth in its operational results, allowing it to focus more actively more holistically on its entire offer.</p>
