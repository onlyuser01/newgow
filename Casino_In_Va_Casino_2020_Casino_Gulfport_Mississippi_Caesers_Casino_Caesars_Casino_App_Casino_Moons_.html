    <h1>Casino In Va Casino 2020 Casino Gulfport Mississippi Caesers Casino Caesars Casino App Casino Moons</h1>

<p>The casino is called Casinomoons Well on October 10th 2022 I deposited 25$ twice so $50 in total that's what I've been playing on. I know if you play the free spins or the promotions that if you go to withdrawal it won't let you cause they were bonuses. But that's not the case. I was playing with the money I deposited and got up to $2000 and something I started to play live blackjack won and lost. I decided at around $1150.00 I was gonna withdrawal. So that's what I did. It put the winnings into the pending section. A couple days later I asked the help person if the day I thought was right for receiving the deposit they agreed that yes that day I thought I would of got it was correct. So I continued to wait till that day. I checked it was still not received so I went to ask them once more then at that time I received an email from casinomoons about my withdrawal getting rejected and they where keeping my winnings and trying to say the reason why I wasn't gonna get it is because my account was bonus abuse. I have the whole conversation screen shoted and the info about withdraw and free spins and every move I did while playing that casino. After I did the withdrawal yes I did play free spins after the withdrawal was already done maybe they got that mixed up or something then thought I was using the free spins for my winnings or something but I can prove that the withdrawal was before I played any free spins. I have more screen shots if you want to see conversation just let me know or email me at j***420@gmail.com thanks for your time and for looking over my message thanks Jason lance</p>
