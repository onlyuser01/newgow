<p>Design Works Gaming has extended its partnership with BetMGM with the supplier entering in the state of Michigan where it will continue to offer iGaming support for the prominent US-facing brand.</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming Launches with BetMGM in Michigan</p>
<p>The Wolverine State has become the second jurisdiction after New Jersey in which Design Works Gaming has deployed its products and the developer intends to continue building upon its momentum at a time when the United States is flirting with the idea of expanding its iGaming regulation even further.</p>
<p>While still done on a state-by-state basis, BetMGM and Design Works Gaming are in a good position to build up together. As a result, BetMGM will now have access to Design Works Gaming’s popular titles and premium content, to name Piggy Payouts, Bank Buster LuckyTap and Test Your Strength Lucky Tap, among many others.</p>
<p>Design Works Gaming has been rapidly making a name for itself, with its titles being some of the most popular options on BetMGM. Commenting on this new opportunity, DWG CEO Troy Zurawski said:</p>
<p>After the success we’ve seen with our games in New Jersey, our team is brimming with excitement to finally be live in Michigan and to debut with the largest operator in the state.</p>
<p>Zurawski noted that it has been only a few short months since Design Game Works made its debut in New Jersey with BetMGM, and that both companies are already seeing some impressive results. “The BetMGM team has been incredible to work with and the collaboration efforts surrounding bespoke games are truly exciting,” Zurawski concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Design Works Gaming has been able to secure four licenses to operate as a legitimate iGaming supplier in the United States. Besides New Jersey and Michigan, the company is also represented in Connecticut and Pennsylvania.</p>
