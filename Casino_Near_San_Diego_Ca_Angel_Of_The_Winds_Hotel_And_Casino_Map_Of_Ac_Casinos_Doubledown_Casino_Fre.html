<p>GGPoker and AffPapa have announced a new landmark partnership which will bring one of the biggest networks of affiliates and one of the world’s most respected online card rooms closer together, allowing players to enjoy a taste of high-quality poker experience, the companies said in a press release shared with Casino Guru News via email.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, GGPoker has quickly become one of the leading poker solutions out there, but it similarly brings online casino and live casino games to its players. The GGPoker software was built from the grounds up, the companies explained in a press release, allowing the poker brand to quickly gain recognition and launch on both mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>Presently, GGPoker brings iGaming and poker aficionados a host of excellent benefits, including a multi-licensed offer with permits to operate by the UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority, secure and easy deposits, a cutting-edge app to make access even easier and so much more.</p>
<p>GGPoker will definitely benefit from the tie-up as it allows it to gain further exposure and reach new audiences, locals, and affiliate companies that can help the poker brand build up all of its verticals. GGPoker Senior Affiliate Manager Aaron Peters welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>"GGPoker is the world’s biggest poker room, with everyone’s favorite poker games hosted on the best software in the industry. We are thrilled to partner with AffPapa and leverage the AffPapa platform to reach out to new and existing poker players. Poker is a great game that absolutely everyone can enjoy, whatever their skill level, and we can’t wait for AffPapa to help us grow poker worldwide."</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan who said that GGPoker is a respected and prominent brand. She added that GGPoker shares AffPapa’s values which makes the partnership a good opportunity for both. AffPapa-registered affiliates can now seek to work with GGPoker and its own Affiliate Program, the press release summed up.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been in the news a lot recently. The company has teamed up with BONS and MuchBetter as recently as this month.</p>
