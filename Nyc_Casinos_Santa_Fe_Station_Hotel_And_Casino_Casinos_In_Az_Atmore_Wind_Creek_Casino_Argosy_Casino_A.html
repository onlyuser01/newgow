    <h1>Nyc Casinos Santa Fe Station Hotel And Casino Casinos In Az Atmore Wind Creek Casino Argosy Casino A</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’ve been playing at Bizzo for the last day or so and have had some good consistent wins and also some nice VIP bonuses. I decided to activate them and made sure to read the terms and conditions first. All good. The terms say $8NZD max with active bonus. I play to that and had a big win. I checked my email tonight and saw that in one of their emails that the max bet is $6.5NZD. I asked support straightaway she said no it’s fine you’ve played it fine it should be around 5 euros and the equals about $8NZD. She stopped responding so I started a new chat, this next agent has told me that the terms in the bonus email is the "unless stated otherwise in special terms" in the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>firstly these emails are generated when the bonus is given -I never read them usually because they’re like spam and secondly when I’m playing at the casino I dont check my email before playing a bonus but I was prudent to read the terms! I’m now being told I’ve technically broken the rules and that there’s chance my winnings could remain untouched but also they can’t promise me anything.</p>
<p>it would be so disheartening for that to happen. I’ve really enjoyed paying here. Everything has been fast and seamless up until this point.</p>
