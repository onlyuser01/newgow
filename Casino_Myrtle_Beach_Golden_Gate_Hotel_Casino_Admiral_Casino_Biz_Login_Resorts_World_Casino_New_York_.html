    <h1>Casino Myrtle Beach Golden Gate Hotel Casino Admiral Casino Biz Login Resorts World Casino New York</h1>

<p>Curacao-licensed Cola Group is boosting its iGaming division, Cola.bet, by investing $14.5 million allocated for the further expansion of the division. The move comes on the back of Cola.bet’s securing a license to join Nigeria, one of the largest gambling markets in Africa, and grows the company footprint in the region, with Zambia, Kenya, and Ethiopia already covered under existing licenses.</p>
<p>Building a Product That Recognizes Market Nuances</p>
<p>With a host of operating permits under its belt, Cola.bet is looking to secure entries in pivotal markets across Europe, Latin America and Africa. The company’s efforts so far have been successful as confirmed by company COO Dinu Bors:</p>
<p>“Cola.bet delivers an exceptional customer-first experience and the launch augments our global ambitions within the iGaming space.”</p>
<p>Bors spoke highly of Cola.bet’s technological lineage, arguing that Cola.bet continues to deliver on strong products that guarantee instant access to numerous markets for any interested B2B partner. More innovative features are planned down the pipeline, Bors reassured.</p>
<p>He was joined by company CMO Dana Varnytska who highlighted Cola.bet’s commitment to building localized programs that successfully identify player preference and market nuances. Varnytska explained that Cola.bet allows players to benefit from bespoke promotions and highly competitive odds for all listed events.</p>
<p>A Highly-Customizable IGaming and Betting Experience</p>
<p>Cola.bet is proud to provide a platform that is easy to customize as per each market needs. The company utilizes local payment methods to empower customers and provide them with a selection of options for sports events, casino games, and esports products. Through Cola Group, the division is able to gain insight into regional trends and deliver on those.</p>
<p>The company’s Curacao license has allowed it to stay competitive in a global market. Cola.bet and its sublicenses comply with local regulatory measures and ensure compliance whereby players from unauthorized countries are not accepted.</p>
<p>Cola.bet puts an equal focus on responsible gambling and delivers on consumer-focused tools and solutions that make it simple for participants to introduce safeguards that protect them from harm’s way. Cola.bet is proud to be holding a Curacao license as it seeks to gather further momentum in international markets.</p>
