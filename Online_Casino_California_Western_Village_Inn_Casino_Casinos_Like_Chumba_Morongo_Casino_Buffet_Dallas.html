<p>International online betting and gaming brand Betway announced today it has reached an agreement to become the title sponsor of South Africa’s T20 Challenge cricket tournament.</p>
<p>Betway T20 Challenge</p>
<p>The Betway T20 Challenge tournament will add to the portfolio of cricket events in South Africa the headquartered in Malta global gaming group supports. Betway is already a title sponsor of all Proteas Tests and One-Day International series which take place in the country.</p>
<p>“We are extremely happy to be announcing our title sponsorship of the Betway T20 Challenge. It enforces our strong commitment to cricket in South Africa and we look forward to being part of this exciting tournament.” Paul Adkins, Marketing and Operations Director, Betway</p>
<p>The agreement between Betway and Cricket South Africa (CSA) includes a rebranding of the 10-day tournament set to take place February 19-28 as Betway T20 Challenge.</p>
<p>“They are already part of our family with their association with Test and ODI cricket and this new agreement just reinforces our partnership with them.” Pholetsi Moseki, Acting CEO, CSA</p>
<p>Win-Win Situation for Everyone</p>
<p>The tournament, which was initiated last year as a replacement for the cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak white-ball Mzansi Super League, is set to feature all white-ball cricket talent South Africa has to offer, allowing audiences across the world to enjoy the competitive action.</p>
<p>“I have no doubt that the Betway T20 Challenge will prove to be a huge hit. We have all our Proteas playing and they are mixed amongst some of the finest cricketers in the country, so it is a win-win situation for everyone.” Pholetsi Moseki, Acting CEO, CSA</p>
<p>Betway’s presence in South Africa as part of the international expansion efforts of the global gaming group marked a strategic partnership with Golden Bridge in April last year, via the regional licensed brand Headsquare.</p>
<p>Recently, the Malta-headquartered sports betting and iGaming operator affirmed its position in another jurisdiction, Brazil, after extending the agreement with one of the most popular esports outfits in the country, the Made in Brazil (MIBR) professional Counter Strike: Global Offense (CS:GO) team.</p>
<p>Under the title sponsorship deal with MIBR, Betway’s logo will feature on the team’s jerseys and social media channels for a fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>MIBR is not the only esports outfit featuring Betway as its title sponsor, as in September 2020, the gaming operator entered into a 1-year agreement with leading DOTA 2 outfit, Peruvian team Beastcoast, to expand its esports portfolio and affirm its commitment to the sport.</p>
