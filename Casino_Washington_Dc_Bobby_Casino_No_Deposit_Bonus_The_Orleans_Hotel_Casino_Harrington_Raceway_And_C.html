    <h1>Casino Washington Dc Bobby Casino No Deposit Bonus The Orleans Hotel Casino Harrington Raceway And C</h1>

<p>Just a week after agreeing to promote AGA's safer gambling campaign, SportsGrid vowed to support another initiative of the Association</p>
<p>The multimedia content and technology company, SportsGrid, confirmed support for the American Gaming Association’s (AGA) Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering. Vowing to support the code, the company revealed that its multimedia content platform will align with the requirements that ensure a responsibility standard for the marketing and advertising of sports betting activities.</p>
<p>Joining the AGA for this initiative, SportsGrid becomes the latest company to support responsible gaming by adhering to a code that seeks to set a new standard for advertising. Additionally, the efforts will also help encourage more bettors to make informed decisions by promoting responsible gaming messaging.</p>
<p>“It’s incumbent upon all stakeholders involved in the marketing of sports wagering—including sportsbooks, media, leagues and teams, and more—to put responsibility first.“ Casey Clark, SVP at AGA</p>
<p>Casey Clark, AGA’s SVP, explained that it is incredibly important for stakeholders within the sector to understand that responsibility is paramount. According to him, the support of companies such as SportsGrid will undoubtedly help raise more awareness and contribute toward responsible advertising.</p>
<p>AGA’s Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering was first released back in 2019. The Association explained that the code helped raise the bar for advertising within the sports betting sector by self-imposing restrictions such as marketing language or target audiences. With the help of AGA members, the Code has gone through important updates and improvements.</p>
<p>The Company Recently Agreed to Promote AGA’s Responsible Gambling Campaign</p>
<p>Adam Kaplan, SportsGrid’s chief operating officer, acknowledged that the company is delighted to show support for AGA’s initiative. He explained: “SportsGrid’s management is committed to supporting the Code across the marketing and advertising of sports wagering on the company’s multimedia platform to promote sound individual decision making by consumers.”</p>
<p>“The AGA’s responsible marketing code sets important standards for the industry to embrace, and SportsGrid is pleased to endorse this initiative.“ Adam Kaplan, chief operating officer at SportsGrid</p>
<p>The latest announcement by SportsGrid comes after only recently, the company agreed to support AGA’s Have A Game Plan Campaign. Last week, SportsGrid confirmed it will promote the Association’s responsible gambling campaign. At the time, the company confirmed that it will use its app, website, multimedia platform and live programming to help spread the word about AGA’s campaign, encouraging more people to engage in responsible betting entertainment.</p>
