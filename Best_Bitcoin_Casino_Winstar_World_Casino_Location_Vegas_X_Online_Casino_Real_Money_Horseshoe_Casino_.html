    <h1>Best Bitcoin Casino Winstar World Casino Location Vegas X Online Casino Real Money Horseshoe Casino</h1>

<p>The leading North American B2B technology provider of real money internet gaming solutions, GAN Limited, announced the launch of its online sports betting and iGaming services for the largest casino in Michigan. Announced Monday, the company introduced its services to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan, the tribe that owns and operates the largest casino in the state: Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort.</p>
<p>The new collaboration will see GAN deploy its GameSTACK enterprise software platform for Soaring Eagle's on-property technical infrastructure. To ensure the success of its product, the company collaborated with Apple iOS, Android apps and Soaring Eagle regarding the design of the sports betting and iGaming front-end web application.</p>
<p>Additionally, the recent launch will see GAN deploy its patented iBridge Framework. Thanks to this, the leading technology provider will seek to monetize Soaring Eagle's vast patron database. Moreover, later this year, the patented framework will help the venue leverage its retail loyalty program.</p>
<p>GAN explained that the deal includes its marketing solution. The company's team of dedicated marketing services specialists will collaborate with Soaring Eagle's counterpart. Ultimately, by joining forces, the two teams will seek to increase player retention and the acquisition of online users.</p>
<p>In a press release on Monday, Soaring Eagle's CEO, Melinda Coffin, revealed that the venue is excited to join forces with GAN. She added that Soaring Eagle will now leverage the company's proven technology "in the State of Michigan to support our iGaming and online sports betting now operational on PlayEagle.com."</p>
<p>Coffin explained: "GAN's enterprise software and marketing expertise will help drive improved adoption and retention of our online offering for current and future players and we look forward to seeing the newly-launched online business complement our established retail gaming business in the coming years."</p>
<p>Currently, Soaring Eagle is the largest casino in Michigan. The venue's 210,000 square-foot casino floor features the biggest variety of table games such as roulette, craps, blackjack and many more.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that the casino floor has thousands of the latest slot machines that offer popular games and even progressives. Visitors of the Soaring Eagle can enjoy the best bingo action in the Midwest as well. The venue also has a poker room, which is currently listed as closed.</p>
<p>GAN's president and CEO, Dermot S. Smurfit, added that the company is thankful for Soaring Eagle's trust in its B2B platform. He explained that the recent launch brings GAN's best B2B services designed especially for Tribal operators. Smurfit outlined that the company's digital marketing services combined with its technology platform have already proved to be a success in other major iGaming markets such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>According to him, the market in Michigan has been growing continuously since its launch. In conclusion, Smurfit said GAN is confident that Soaring Eagle will leverage its strong brand, significant database and capitalize on a major share of the online gambling market in Michigan.</p>
<p>The recent launch at Soaring Eagle marks the fourth successful collaboration for GAN in Michigan. On the other hand, the company's portfolio continues to grow. By now, GAN has ten real money online gambling technology deals in place around the US.</p>
