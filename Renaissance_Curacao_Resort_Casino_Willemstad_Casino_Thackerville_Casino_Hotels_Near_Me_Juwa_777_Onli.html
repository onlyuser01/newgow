<p>British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) will get a further boost for its PlayNow.com brand through OpenBet, a global leader in betting solutions</p>
<p>The present alliance represents an extension of the deal between the two companies, making the PlayNow.com product available to the Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>OpenBet Helps BCLC’s Gaming Brand Launch in Saskatchewan</p>
<p>As a result, PlayNow.com is now live in the Saskatchewan province in Canada, a launch facilitated by OpenBet’s Player Account Management platform and sports betting technology.</p>
<p>BCLC is also tending to PlayNow.com with a number of third-party suppliers to offer more fulfilling and worthwhile gaming and sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>OpenBet is also leveraged as a solution that can help PlayNow.com better the player channelization in the regulated market, as the platform is known to outperform black market operations.</p>
<p>OpenBet CCO Cathryn Lai welcomed the opportunity to be collaborating with BCLC and help it expand into Saskatchewan. Lai noted:</p>
<p>Congratulations to SIGA and BCLC on bringing regulated sports betting and iGaming to Saskatchewan. Now, players have an opportunity to enjoy best-in-class betting entertainment in a safe and secure environment through the renowned PlayNow brand. OpenBet CCO Cathryn Lai</p>
<p>She continued by explaining the significance of this partnership and added that was an expansion into a fifth province for OpenBet, with activities already set up in Manitoba, Quebec, Atlantic Canada, British Columbia, and now Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Lai further praised the collaboration with BCLC arguing that it has been a fundamental part of the company’s success in the Canadian market. As to BCLC, company COO Dan Beebe was similarly pleased with the opportunity.</p>
<p>He hailed the significance of this new expansion with OpenBet and lauded the company’s technology platform which will now be able to bring the PlayNow.com brand beyond the confines of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Boosting Channelization in the Regulated Market</p>
<p>“We have enjoyed significant growth in Manitoba in recent years, and believe we are well positioned to enjoy similar success in Saskatchewan with a similar model,” Beebe explained. SIGA CEO and president Zane Hansen similarly welcomed the opportunity and said that introducing a regulated online gambling platform in the province is a huge boon to the local gaming community.</p>
<p>He further hailed PlayNow.com’s track record and the underpinning products by OpenBet and BCLC. All of this would help provide local players in the province with a dependable iGaming product.</p>
