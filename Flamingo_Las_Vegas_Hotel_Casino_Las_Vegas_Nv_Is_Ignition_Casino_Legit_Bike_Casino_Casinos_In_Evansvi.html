    <h1>Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Is Ignition Casino Legit Bike Casino Casinos In Evansvi</h1>

<p>I began the withdrawal process on 29 November and provided all the required banking information for a wire transfer. Additionally which I’ve never experienced before, it also asked my birth country and town.</p>
<p>I then received an email saying that they’d noticed my birth country was different than my registered address and if I could provide proof of legal residency.</p>
<p>It was annoying and tedious, but this was a first. However, I did manage to forward the necessary information, directly from the Australian dept of home affairs website (VEVO), regarding my permanent resident visa. It verified that I currently hold permanent resident status indefinitely. In Australia you don’t need a visa or passport unless you’re travelling.</p>
<p>The information I forwarded to them was exactly what you’d provide to an employer or govt agency if they were after the same kind of evidence.</p>
<p>After some back and forth, because they’d asked for my passport (I haven’t had one in years, and my most previous one was stolen), I explained this to them and offered to provide a police incident report number regarding the theft.</p>
<p>I thought that it was resolved because the last email I received was a request for the screenshot of my credit card used for deposit, front and back. I provided this, and they haven’t replied since even though I’ve tried to email them for confirmation of receipt.</p>
<p>So just about an hour ago, I went back on my online account with ABigCandy to see if their live chat could enlighten me or give me an update on my status. I was really disappointed though when I realised that my withdrawal wasn’t even being processed, the entire amount was still there (initially when I’d started the withdrawal it displayed a balance of $2.64, because I’d put in a withdrawal request for $640.00) and the withdrawal was being processed/verified. Now, it was back to $642.64, as if I’d never even attempted to initiate the withdrawal in the first place. I was able to talk to live chat and explained my situation to her, and she asked whether I’d provided my proof of legal residency and I told her I had, and that I had most recently received the email requesting my bank card screenshot (front &amp; back), but had not heard anything back since. She asked if I’d provided my legal residency proof prior to my withdrawal being denied!!??</p>
<p>It was literally the first time I’d heard that my withdrawal was denied, and I was obviously really stressed out and disappointed, considering I’ve had to really go above and beyond to gather all the necessary information to give them &amp; that I’d exchanged about 20+ emails with both their customer service and payment department. I was advised by the live chat agent to attempt my withdrawal again, but also that their payment department wasn’t available over the weekend. I had a feeling that this might be the case (that’s why I’ve been doing everything in my power to get this withdrawal processed since Wednesday).</p>
<p>Anyway, I have provided all the necessary information and documentation for verification purposes and now I just want what’s rightfully mine. Instead I’ve been mislead and basically ignored. The fact that I have a bank account and a govt issued proof of age card should’ve been more than enough proof regarding my legal residence status (these are all things you can’t obtain if you’re not a legal citizen/permanent resident here), but I did what was asked and managed to provide the visa proof they requested. I honestly don’t know what else I can do to redeem my winnings. Also, I’m sure it’ll be no surprise to you, that they didn’t give me any kind of issues the many times I deposited money. If they don’t want to pay my winnings out to me, can I somehow redeem my deposits? Obviously if I’m not eligible to withdraw the funds, it stands to read that I shouldn’t have been eligible to deposit them either (after all it was from the same account). Anyone else up for a class action suit, lol?</p>
