    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Resort Dc Casino Casinos Biloxi Mississippi Durango Casino Jobs Casino At Dania Wir</h1>

<p>Dear Xotin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked Responsible Gaming section on the website, and this is what I found https://www.wirwetten.com/en/help/general/responsibility:</p>
<p>„ Self exclusion</p>
<p>You have the possibility to exclude yourself from gambling. This can be done in your "Personal account". Simply choose the time range for which you would like to be excluded and confirm you decision."</p>
<p>"An account holder has the possibility to close its account in his/her personal account section. Any funds in the account will be remitted to the account holder.</p>
<p>If an existing Wir Wetten account should be closed by Wir Wetten, any obligations already entered will be honored. If an account holder wants to recover funds from an already closed, locked or excluded account, he has to contact the customer support.</p>
<p>If an account has been closed due to fraud or problem gambling, an individual is not allowed to register for a new account. Wir Wetten will not be liable, if an individual succeeds in reopening a new account, not for any damages caused by this individual. Wir Wetten reserves the right to close an account opened in breach of this rule at any point."</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
