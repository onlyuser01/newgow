    <h1>Muckleshoot Casino Resort Ho Chunk Casino Black River Falls Choctaw Casino Wind Creek Montgomery Cas</h1>

<p>Hello. I think the Hotline casino is being unfair. They requested a photo of my bank card for verification. I couldn't provide the card immediately because I lost it. I ordered a card from the bank, but it's been made for a while.</p>
<p>A week after the request, I received an email saying my account was blocked because I didn't provide a card for a week. I explained all the circumstances to the casino. I repeat, I lost my card before requesting a casino, I immediately ordered a new card from the bank. I think that an important reason. As evidence, I attached an application to create a new card that I filed to the bank. I asked the casino to give me extra time.</p>
<p>On October 19, I received a new bank card and sent it to the casino. A few days later I received an answer. "Your documents have been accepted and verified by the Security Service."</p>
<p>I tried to sign in to my account, but it was still blocked. I contacted support and ask them to unlock account. Casino officials said my account would remain locked and my funds confiscated.</p>
<p>Obviously, the casino is changing its mind and doesn't want to pay my winnings. As my review is complete, I ask the casino to withdraw my funds immediately in the amount of EUR 460.</p>
