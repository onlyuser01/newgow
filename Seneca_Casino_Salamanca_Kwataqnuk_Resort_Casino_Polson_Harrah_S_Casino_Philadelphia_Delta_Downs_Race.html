    <h1>Seneca Casino Salamanca Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Polson Harrah S Casino Philadelphia Delta Downs Race</h1>

<p>After making a payment with a credit card and paypal that I don't own (I was with a friend and we used his card and his Paypal), I won 17,700 euros playing a Gioco Digitale slot. After several days of discussion in chat, the customer service made me remove the payment methods that were not mine and made me add (through a new payment) a credit card in my name to be able to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>Since then I have only been able to withdraw 100 EURO out of the 17,700 of my winnings because every time I try a larger amount, the withdrawal is refused without any reason or communication from the casino. From there I open a report in the chat, every day, where I am told that I will be contacted within 24-48 hours but this NEVER happens.</p>
<p>After ten days with my winnings blocked on the site without the possibility of withdrawal, today I receive an email from customer service that reads as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello XXXXX,</p>
<p>thanks for contacting us.</p>
<p>We inform you that, following a new regulation concerning the Italian legislation on remote gaming, from now on it will be possible to withdraw only on the payment methods through which the deposit was previously made.</p>
<p>Requested withdrawals will be automatically processed via the deposit methods used, for an amount equal to the amount of the deposit. Once this amount is exceeded, you can choose the desired withdrawal method.</p>
<p>Therefore you have to withdraw 270.00 euros with PayPal and 78.00 euros with the XXXX final card.</p>
<hr />
<p>the problem is that the methods they indicated are the same methods that they themselves made me remove because they are not owned by me. I clearly reported the matter to customer service and the whole ballet of non-existent assistance is repeated, postponing it every day for 24-48 hours and then starting all over again, hoping that I will replay my winnings.</p>
