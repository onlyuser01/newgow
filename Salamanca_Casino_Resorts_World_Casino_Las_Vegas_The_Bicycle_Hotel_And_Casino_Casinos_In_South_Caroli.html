<p>Rock Bottom review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Rock Bottom has a crime noir theme.</p>
<p>Players will step into a shadowy world where gangsters rule the streets, and femme fatales are a deadly force. With a shot of whiskey, and a few dirty tricks, players might make it through the night.</p>
<p>This slot is a great pick for fans of noir fiction and graphic novels such as Sin City.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The moody soundtrack is infused with rock chords that give it a cool vintage feel. Players may find themselves swaying to the rhythm and feeling ready to stay up all night chasing mysterious criminals.</p>
<p>The animation is primarily black and white, with pops of color for emphasis. This aesthetic seems like a respectful nod to the style of Sin City and other noir graphic novels.</p>
<p>A variety of memorable characters appear on the reels, including a tough-looking femme fatale, and a clown that brings to mind the Joker from the Batman universe. A mob boss in sunglasses, and an eccentrically dressed pimp also make appearances. There is no doubt that every individual in Rock Bottom’s world has a dark backstory.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, towering city buildings can be seen, their windows glowing in the dark. A movie theater board glows faintly in the corner, adding to the cinematic vibes.</p>
<p>Overall, Rock Bottom’s soundtrack and aesthetic create a gritty world of drama and crime.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Rock Bottom has a 3-4-4-4-3 reel structure.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels. Winning combinations are calculated from the leftmost reel towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>The maximum payout of Rock Bottom is 19690x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for the highest winning combination possible.</p>
<p>The xSplit symbol appears on reels 2-4 and has the ability to divide itself, as well as character symbols in its row. When the xSplit symbol divides itself, it becomes two Wild symbols.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can appear on any of the reels, and when players land at least 3, the Bonus Mode is triggered. The version of the Bonus triggered is decided by the number of triggering Scatters. During both versions, players will progress through 5 stages, receiving a range of multiplier bonuses. There are enhanced bonuses if the feature was triggered by 5 or more Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Players can opt to increase their bet by 50% to guarantee a Scatter symbol on reel 2.</p>
<p>Players who reach a win of more than 1969x their bet will trigger the xCap, giving them the option to select a random multiplier to be applied to their winnings.</p>
