<p>Dazzle Me Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a whimsical jewel theme.</p>
<p>In a world of glitter, players will discover a golden reel full of gems cut into adorable shapes. Some are heart-shaped rubies, others shamrock-shaped emeralds.</p>
<p>Players in the mood for a classic vibe and an uplifting mood will love this game.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A tune shimmering with chimes plays in the background. Players might feel as though they are being welcomed into fairyland as the ethereal notes play. The reels land with a gentle shuffle that makes them feel authentic.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is an enchanting wallpaper of sparkles. This creates the feeling that the player is surrounded by magic dust and adds to the enchanting atmosphere.</p>
<p>Among the jewel symbols are golden bells that will remind players of classic slot machines. Most eye-catching, though, are the gems themselves, animated cheerful hues of purple, green, blue and red.</p>
<p>Overall, the sound and graphics work together to create a mood-lifting world of treats.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Dazzle Me Megaways uses the Megaways system, randomising the number of symbols that appear in the reels each spin.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins using the Any Way Wins system. This means that payouts are triggered by landing matching symbols in adjacent reels going from left to right.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish to make way for fresh symbols to fall into their positions.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for every symbol except the Free Spins symbol.</p>
<p>The Dazzling Wild Reels feature is triggered at random while in the base game. Up to 3 reels are chosen randomly to be made up entirely of Wild symbols for initial spins. However, during cascades, other symbols may also appear on these reels.</p>
<p>When players land 4 or more Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels, the Free Spins feature is triggered. Players begin with 8 free spins and every additional Free Spins symbol awards 4 additional free spins.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, players will see at least one Dazzling Wild Reel during each spin. While in the feature, only Wild symbols will appear on the Dazzling Reels during spins and cascades.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.1%, about our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less optimal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, medium volatility jewel-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though its strategy profile is average, this game elevates itself with pretty animation and a joyful style.</p>
<p>These qualities make it fun to play and it comes as no surprise that this slot is high in popularity.</p>
