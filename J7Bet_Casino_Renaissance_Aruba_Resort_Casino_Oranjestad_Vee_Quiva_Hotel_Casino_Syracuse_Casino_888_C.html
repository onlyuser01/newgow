    <h1>J7Bet Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino Oranjestad Vee Quiva Hotel Casino Syracuse Casino 888 C</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>It is with great regret and concern that I am writing to you regarding my outstanding winnings and the inexplicable account closure at X1 Casino. It seems that these actions have been taken due to my winning activities, which is incredibly frustrating for me. The way I have been treated as a player is extremely disrespectful and inappropriate. Sadly, there are some casinos which do not hesitate to treat their players poorly and potentially even cheat them.</p>
<p>This matter involves winnings of 8,000 Euros, of which 4,000 Euros have already been transferred to my account. The remaining 4,000 Euros have not been paid to me despite assurances from X1 Casino until the start of December 2023. In view of this situation, I am turning to you in the hope of receiving support.</p>
<p>Despite repeated written requests to forward my outstanding winnings to be processed by the finance department, I have not yet received any response. Moreover, I have made several attempts to contact my VIP advisor. Unfortunately, she only responded once, assuring me that the remaining 4,000 Euros will be transferred by the beginning of December. Since this payment has not been made, I contacted her again, but suddenly, she is no longer responding to my inquiries.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that the casino informed me on November 17, 2023,:</p>
<p>"VIP Stakes/X1</p>

<p>Hi Pepe,</p>
<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I just got an update regarding your pending balance in your X1 account, it will be processed within this month.</p>
<p>Wishing you a great day ahead."</p>
<p>I have noticed that the chat staff always responded promptly before I won. However, after I won, it seems as though they are avoiding communication with me.</p>
<p>I kindly ask you for your assistance and resolution to this problem. It is extremely frustrating and disappointing that despite multiple attempts and assurances, I am still waiting for my outstanding winnings.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Pepe</p>
