<p>Erik ten Hag’s debut at the helm of Manchester United started disastrously with a 2-1 loss to Brighton at Old Trafford. Fast-forward a week and the Red Devils need to do all they can to bounce back with a win. Unfortunately for them, it’s not going to be easy as on Saturday, August 13, they’re playing against Brentford on the road.</p>
<p>The good news for Man United is that they defeated Brentford in both games last season. The bad news is that morale is high in Brentford’s locker room at the moment, following a decent performance in round 1 when they drew with Leicester City on the road.</p>

<p>The Bees are Looking Good</p>
<p>Brentford’s squad for the 2022-23 season looks pretty decent as the club’s managed to keep the core of the team intact while also signing a couple of new players. During the summer transfer period, they strengthened their defense by bringing in experienced central defender Ben Mee from Burnley. They also signed enthusiastic youngster Aaron Hickey from Bologna, a player whose preferred position is left-back.</p>
<p>These guys did well against Leicester City, but it was Brentford’s favorites Josh Dasilva and Ivan Toney who scored the goals in round 1. These guys have been in the club for many years, turning themselves into crucial parts of the team over time.</p>
<p>A Must Win for Manchester United</p>
<p>The Red Devils were supposed to have an easy job in round 1, but a massive upset happened. Brighton beat them in Manchester 2-1. The worst thing is that even the one goal scored by Manchester Utd wasn’t the work of their players – Brighton’s midfielder Alexis Mac Allister scored an own-goal.</p>
<p>It was the first game with Erik ten Hag as the boss of Man United, and it’s now up to him to prove he’s the right man for the job. He did make a couple of controversial decisions on his debut, most notably, keeping outcast Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench until the second half.</p>
<p>CR7, who’s looking for a way out of Man United, didn’t do much in that game, but this time, we’re certain he’s going to do better. The same, actually, goes for all of the Red Devils, who just mustn’t drop points again.</p>
<p>Brentford vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>The Red Devils have no other option before them but to go to Brentford and try and get a win. They need to get to the winning track ASAP because their schedule is going to get much tougher in near future. For instance, their opponent in Matchweek 3 is Liverpool. They can’t count on points in that game, but they are definitely capable of getting all three against Brentford.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester United to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
