<p>FSB is focusing on accelerating growth in the UK, Europe and Africa, considering markets in the US cost-prohibitive</p>
<p>Global gaming and betting solutions supplier FSB is changing its focus in 2023 by de-prioritizing operations in the US and concentrating on markets in the UK, Ireland, Europe and Africa, but will continue efforts in Ontario.</p>
<p>Interim CEO to Lead the Way</p>
<p>FSB announced the changes for the upcoming year in an update of the company’s strategy which also includes new leadership – Adam Smith will be appointed to role of Interim Chief Executive Officer after CEO David McDowell stepped down to take a role on the Board.</p>
<p>Smith, who will be responsible for the updated strategy implementation at the London-based gambling tech company, expressed what “a great honor” for him is to lead the company into 2023 as the business is moving into its next chapter.</p>
<p>“The strength of our world-class technology and the talent of our people means there is a huge opportunity ahead for the organization,” Smith said, looking forward to commencing work with “this driven, determined leadership team” that he has no doubt will bring success to the company in its core markets in the near future.</p>
<p>FSB has decided to change its operational focus and de-prioritize markets in North America after a hugely successful year in the UK, Europe and Africa, where the gambling tech supplier has entered into significant partnerships with key operators.</p>
<p>“Our end-of-year strategic review has allowed us to further sharpen our laser focus when it comes to delivering for existing and new partners across our core markets in 2023 and we continue to work closely with our private equity partners Clairvest and share with them a huge sense of positivity for the year ahead,” Smith added.</p>
<p>‘Bedrock’ of Operations</p>
<p>FSB now considers its non-US markets as the “bedrock” of its operations and in 2023 will be focusing on growth acceleration by maximizing revenue with existing customers and exploring new opportunities to expand the reach of its platform and solutions.</p>
<p>“2022 has been a successful year for FSB across our core markets with new partnerships forged and existing customers enjoying strong growth and new market expansion,” said FSB’s chief revenue officer Ian Freeman, feeling privileged to be part of that success.</p>
<p>Hailing the company’s “exceptional operational teams” across these markets, Freeman outlined that FSB’s primary goal is to make sure that its “resources are aligned to support the best market conditions and the revenue opportunities” ahead, and hence, FSB will be de-prioritizing its investment in the cost-prohibitive US market in the short- to medium term.</p>
<p>After an active year in the US, securing license approvals in Nevada and South Dakota, FSB is moving those markets to the back burner. A third North American market where the tech supplier has obtained regulatory approval, Ontario, will maintain the company’s committed focus, with plans for two additional launches underway.</p>
