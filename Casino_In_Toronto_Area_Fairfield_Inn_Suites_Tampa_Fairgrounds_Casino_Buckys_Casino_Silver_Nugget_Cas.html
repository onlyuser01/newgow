<p>Information about Christmas-themed casino games</p>
<p>If you celebrate Christmas, you might be used to playing board games with friends and family during the festive season. But with the advent of the online era, we also spend a lot of the Christmas break online. It's therefore no surprise that Christmas-themed casino games have become a popular favorite.</p>
<p>Featuring traditional Xmas characters, from Frosty the Snowman to old Saint Nick himself, the games bring us festive cheer and help us get in the mood for 'the most wonderful time of the year' (at least, according to Andy Williams).</p>
<p>But what if we want to only find the best Christmas casino games offered by the finest online casinos? That's what this page is here for, to point you in the right direction of the best possible festive playing time and make sure you'll be having a wonderful Christmastime*.</p>
<p>*OK, that's enough old Christmas song references. We promise.</p>
<p>What are Christmas casino games?</p>
<p>Let's start off with a slight correction. When we say 'Christmas casino games', we should strictly be saying 'Christmas slots', as these make up most of the festive titles you'll find online.</p>
<p>These Xmas slots all share one defining feature: they're based on Christmas-themed storylines and characters – or a related theme, like a snowball fight with characters wearing Santa hats.</p>
<p>These games also often have one or more of the following distinctive features, which are now almost clichés:</p>
<p>A name about something Christmas-related, like Santa Spins or a Christmas pun</p>
<p>Festive, often cheesy, background music, featuring sleigh bells</p>
<p>Christmas-based reels, with snowman, Santa, and Christmas tree icons</p>
<p>Seasonal bonus features, like a stocking full of prizes.</p>
<p>For players wanting to get into the festive mood, Christmas slots are a great way to have fun while trying to win prizes. You don't have to play for money, either: all the games you see on this page are available for free play, so you can pick one you like and just play for the fun of it. We also have lots of other free games available, if you want a change from the Christmas theme.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>The best Christmas slots</p>
<p>When you open this page, you'll see a list of Christmas-based games that you can try out just by clicking the 'Play' icon when you hover over the game. The games are created especially with a Christmas theme in mind, so as you are trying a few different ones, you'll be able to see the creativity that developers have put into them as they try to create a festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you are not sure where to get started, there are a few notable titles that you can give a try first:</p>
<p>Many Christmas slots based on Santa Claus, which makes sense seeing as he is the classic bearer of gifts. Santa Spins, Santa's Gift Rush, and Ho Ho Ho are all examples of popular games based on the jolly, bearded one.</p>
<p>Some games here are simply Christmas editions of popular slot games. Ramses Book by Gamomat is one of those. Taking the classic Egyptian theme that inspired the original game and sprinkling it with Christmas flavors (a rare mix, we know) the developers do a good job of creating a slot that runs smoothly. The game's excellent free spins feature is still in place, which helps it generate a high RTP (Return to Player). Netent's Fruit Shop and Joker Madness by Spinomenal are other popular slots that get the festive treatment.</p>
<p>Christmas games that aren't slots are rare, but Spinomenal have released a festive version of their European Roulette game. That said, it appears that the only alteration they've made in honor of Christmas is to have snow falling in the background. The game is still the same as the original, so we don't really see the point. Still, it's great if you like snow!</p>
<p>How to find the best Xmas slots casinos</p>
<p>Finding a great Xmas slot doesn't mean that much if the casino you play it on sucks. Bad casinos can ruin your playing experience by holding onto your winnings, giving you bad customer service, or even having frequent technical problems.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has devised a rating and filter system that assesses the key performance indicators of all the casinos on our database, and to steer you away from those bad sites.</p>
<p>To find the best Christmas slots casinos possible, go to the Xmas slot game that you'd like to play on and click on 'Play in Casino'. This will take you down to a list of sites that offer the game.</p>
<p>From here, you'll be able to see the Safety Index of the casino, ranging from very low to highest, as well as the types of games it has. Obviously, we advise you to stick to the most reputable casino sites.</p>
<p>To find out more about the casino, click on the 'Quick info' option to draw up a detailed information box. This will show you how we arrived at our decision, with facts and warnings about the site and its important features. You can also click on 'Read Review' and see the casino's Safety Index out of 10, as well as a more detailed analysis.</p>
<p>The Safety Index is made up of a range of objective factors that we believe make a good casino. The following aspects are a few important examples.</p>
<p>Casino size and revenue Size doesn't always matter, but with casinos, it can tell us if they have the revenue to pay out big wins. Often, huge casinos with high revenue levels have no problem paying out if you land a jackpot: this may not always be the case with smaller sites that have to watch what they pay out. Blacklists Casinos that perform badly end up on blacklists. If a particular site appears on one, we'll let you know so that you can make a safe and informed decision. Terms and conditions T&amp;Cs may be in small print, but they tell you a lot about a casino. If they're fair, you're probably in good hands. Our team read through all the finer details for you and will let you know if there's anything alarming. Responsible gambling tools Any casino worth its salt will have tools available to help keep players gambling safely, including self-exclusion options and access to gambling addiction treatment. We've built this factor into our scoring system, so that the sites that do well with this score better. The aim is to make finding a safe casino as easy as possible for you with the help of our tools. Best of luck with your search!</p>
