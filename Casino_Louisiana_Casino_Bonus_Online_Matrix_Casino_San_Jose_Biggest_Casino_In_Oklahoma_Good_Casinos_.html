    <h1>Casino Louisiana Casino Bonus Online Matrix Casino San Jose Biggest Casino In Oklahoma Good Casinos</h1>

<p>Hi all! I want to share with you the problem of the incompetence of this bookmaker! this completely sucks, initially I want to tell you that these are scammers who deliberately delay payments, Iâ€™ll explain why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On November 24, they asked me for documents to withdraw funds, they did not send instructions on where I should send these documents. On their website I found instructions that documents should be sent to the email address "verify.uk@betway.com", I sent them there. They do not send any response about whether my documents were received!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Monday, November 27, I asked the support service about the results of the check, they told me that they had not received any documents from me, although I sent them everything on the same day that they asked me to (if necessary, I can provide all the screenshots ). They asked me to send them the documents again to the address: "verify.uk@betway.com" and I did it (I can also provide screenshots). The support service representative notified that the documents had been uploaded and that the results of the verification should be awaited. Their website states that verification takes 24 hours. As a result, I waited 4 days and they sent me a letter saying that I needed to upload the documents again to a completely different address, although before that their employee assured me that the documents had been successfully received!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In total, they are deliberately delaying my winnings, I provided them with documents twice!</p>
<p>I am looking for justice from you and I hope that you will help solve this problem! This bookmaker is completely incompetent and he does not value his reputation at all!</p>
<p>To confirm my words, I can provide screenshots for everything!</p>
