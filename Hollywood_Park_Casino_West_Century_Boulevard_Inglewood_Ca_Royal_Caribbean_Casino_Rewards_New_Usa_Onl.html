<p>As per the latest results released by the American Gaming Association, the United States has seen a total of $13 billion wagered in 2019 with the bulk of all bets focusing on three states.</p>
<p>Nevada, New Jersey and Pennsylvania Claim the Bulk of Sports Handle in 2019</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) revealed the 2019 sports betting results, reporting that $13 billion had been staked legally on sports in the United States during the period. This is over a 50% increase from 2018 when Americans wagered $6.6 billion, the association specified.</p>
<p>A total of 14 states offered legal sports betting options – although not necessarily all options – through December 31, 2019, and certain states launched their betting product for the first time, AGA said.</p>
<p>Nevada is no longer the Mecca of sports betting, AGA’s results reveal, as 59% of the total stakes were placed outside the Silver State. The major boost in betting activities has come after the May 2018 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to delegate the responsibility of regulating sports betting down to each individual state.</p>
<p>NEW: 2019 sports betting numbers are in. Bettors nationwide legally wagered $13 billion in the first full calendar year since the Supreme Court invalidated PASPA, close to double the nearly $6.6 billion handle in 2018. pic.twitter.com/5X8fxm079P — American Gaming Association (@AmericanGaming) February 5, 2020</p>
<p>With PASPA formally defeated, this has occasioned a significant increase in sports betting across the United States. Homing in on Nevada, AGA explained that the online segment remains the busiest with seven out of every $10 wagered on the Internet.</p>
<p>Nevada isn’t yet losing its clout as the busiest state when it comes to sports betting and the total numbers went to support that claim with the Silver State claiming $5.3 billion over the year, followed by New Jersey – the state that helped defeat PASPA – with $4.6 billion and third – Pennsylvania for $1.5 billion in total sports betting handle in 2019.</p>
<p>Minnesota Posting Decent Results</p>
<p>Not all data has been included in AGA’s report however. For example, New Hampshire only launched sports betting in December 30, 2019 and New Mexico and New York don’t actually share their results publicly as per request of the tribes.</p>
<p>Conversely, Mississippi and Oregon results were included – even though the states don’t share this information as well. MI, which is shaping up to be one of the largest betting states as well, collected $369 million in 2019 and Oregon contributed the modest $45 million to the total.</p>
<p>As of 2020, there are six states that are preparing to legalize their sports betting products, pushing the total number of states where it is legal to make a sports bet to 20 in 2020.</p>
<p>As a result of legalizing sports betting, estimated $152 million has been contributed to states’ coffers.</p>
