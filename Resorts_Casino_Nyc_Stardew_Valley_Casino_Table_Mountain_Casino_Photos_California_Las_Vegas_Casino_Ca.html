<p>Hi all! I want to share with you a good book if you are interested in poker. It's called "Poker for Experienced Players". Unfortunately, I can’t upload the file here, but I’ll tell you where to download it for free. On poker.ru you can find it by its name. Here is part of the introduction.</p>
<p>Texas Hold'em and other poker modifications are intellectual games in which you can win using a strategy based on mathematical calculations, tactics, and psychology. Successful playing of the game requires the study of theory. A trained user gains an advantage over rivals.</p>
<p>How to study strategy</p>
<p>Standard methods do not provide maximum profit, but they allow you to understand the basics of the strategy. It is necessary to continue in-depth training, which will allow finding optimal solutions in any game situation.</p>
<p>Need to study:</p>
<p>● Psychology - this allows you to organize training, find the right approach to game sessions, set goals, achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>● Bankroll management - by competently managing poker capital, a poker player avoids bankruptcy, ensures the implementation of the mathematical expectation.</p>
<p>● Tactics - tricks and bluffs to mislead opponents, to remain unpredictable. A tactically active participant in the distribution earns more than a user with a template behavior in the auction.</p>
<p>● Mathematics - being able to calculate probabilities, pot odds, a poker player can determine situations that are beneficial for investing in a bank.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is impossible to learn a profitable game quickly. Even experienced players who have made a career continue to learn, improve their skills and gain experience by analyzing their own game history and identifying mistakes.</p>
<p>I hope the info will be useful.</p>
