    <h1>A Big Candy Casino No Deposit Bonus Mgm Casino Vegas Turtle Creek Casino Hotel St Croix Casino Danbu</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my winnings are not paid out here.</p>
<p>I played without a bonus.</p>
<p>In order to receive the payout, I had to identify myself.</p>
<p>I immediately uploaded all the required documents.</p>
<p>My payout has been cancelled.</p>
<p>the email says, not the reason.</p>
<p>The email says the payout has been canceled and I would receive a separate email detailing the reason.</p>
<p>such email never arrived.</p>
<p>the game then went back and forth 6 times, every day.</p>
<p>An email never came to my request</p>
<p>I was always put off.</p>
<p>my case was forwarded etc.</p>
<p>After a few days I got an email.</p>
<p>the legitimation was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I need to send a screenshot of my deposit.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Then it was canceled again, I'm supposed to take the screenshots on a pc, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the name.</p>
<p>so did I.</p>
<p>then it was canceled again.</p>
<p>After what felt like 100 requests, I was told that the screenshot was not sufficient because there was no name on the transaction list.</p>
<p>so I got from my cell phone</p>
<p>photographed my paysave account several times.</p>
<p>and the same also in the computer.</p>
<p>because there is no name on the paysave deposit list, the payment cannot be made.</p>
<p>what should I do? Rewrite the paysave program????</p>
<p>After several days of fighting, the amount has still not been paid to me.</p>
<p>Since I won't receive the money anyway, I kept playing.</p>
<p>The course of the game was suddenly completely different. No matter how many times I played, no matter what the stakes, it was impossible to win anything.</p>
<p>it was all downhill.</p>
<p>with a euro bet.</p>
<p>even if it sounds unimaginable, it was no longer possible to win!!!</p>
<ol>
<li>20% cashback is advertised on the site.</li>
</ol>
<p>After more than 7 emails, I received a cashout of 20 euros.</p>
<p>with a deposit of more than 1000 euros.</p>
<p>for all other deposits, similar cases.</p>
<p>you have to run after them until you get a cashout.</p>
<p>I received another cashout after several emails, but it was canceled without giving a reason.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make a profit at this casino.</p>
<p>and if you win a fraction of your bet times, it doesn't pay out.</p>
<p>new reasons are always invented</p>
<p>because they speculate that the profit will then be played down anyway.</p>
<p>I wonder if a player who won with paysave has ever received a payout.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one who deposited at this casino via paysave.</p>
<p>so if you deposit with paysave, you can't get a withdrawal.</p>
<p>because the name is not displayed in the transaction list.</p>
<p>I made a screenshot of all steps.</p>
<p>I even sent the confirmation email about the paysave deposit as a screenshot.</p>
<p>It all came to nothing.</p>
<p>That such fraudsters are allowed to legally operate online casinos is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>The main thing is that everyone dutifully pays their taxes.</p>
<p>I will email a complaint to all the sites I can find.</p>
<p>also to the headquarters of the casinos.</p>
<p>post on all sites what scammers they are.</p>
<p>all my fellow players are warning that this site is a scam casino.</p>
<p>I have played at several casinos</p>
<p>but I've never been ripped off so obviously.</p>
