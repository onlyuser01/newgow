    <h1>Hotel Near Foxwoods Casino Iwild Casino Best Online Casino Usa Casino Philadelphia Tulalip Casino Ne</h1>

<p>The newly built casino resort in downtown Las Vegas, Circa, is creating 1,500 jobs during times when the Sin City has been massively impacted by the coronavirus and unemployment is skyrocketing. The casino property that is set to greet its first guest October 28, has already hired 1,100 workers and is ideally looking for 400 more.</p>
<p>The gaming and hospitality industry in Nevada was among the most affected by the casino properties’ shutdown ordered by Governor Steve Sisolak in mid-March, looking to curb the further spread of the deadly coronavirus infection. The properties reopened June 4, but demand for their services has been low due to exposure to air traffic and slump in global tourism, and pre-closure levels are far from being reached.</p>
<p>People Leaving Las Vegas</p>
<p>Consequently, a lot of people lost their jobs and in their desperation that they could not find another, left Las Vegas, a main concern for Circa’s owner Derek Stevens questioning whether enough people remained to allow a proper selection of personnel for his new casino resort.</p>
<p>Despite that by mid-September the downtown property managed to hire about 1,100 people for positions ranging from casino dealers to cocktail servers and lifeguards, Stevens felt Circa was running behind schedule in terms of acquiring its personnel, as the initial goal was to add about 400 more.</p>
<p>The new Las Vegas property will comprise of 1,350 slot machines, 49 table games, 777 hotel rooms with 60 suites inside the 35-storey hotel tower, 6 restaurants and 5 bars, and a 5th floor three-tiered Stadium Swim Aquatheater with 6 pools. A huge three-level sports book will feature 1,000 seats for viewers, VSiN sports betting television studio and radio booths for up to 3 broadcast teams at a time. The sports book will also have a Circa-branded football contest.</p>
<p>Optimism Prevails</p>
<p>Derek Stevens does not hide his optimism that Las Vegas will bounce back stronger from the current crisis, and his property providing jobs, excitement and good news for local people makes him feel quite excited.</p>
<p>“We’re getting to the point where the excitement level as well as the stress level are both starting to kick into high gear. We’ve been prepared, but there are always last-minute things that are a little bit in flux.” Derek Stevens, Owner, Circa</p>
<p>Steven’s property is not the only one that is preparing to open doors during times when safety restrictions are weighing down on demand for entertainment. The $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas which is still under construction on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip is scheduled to open next summer and hire nearly 6,000 people.</p>
<p>Both new properties are expected to make a difference in the economic recovery of Las Vegas, certain to drive new visitations to the Sin City, according to the President and CEO of the Nevada Resorts Association, Virginia Valentine.</p>
