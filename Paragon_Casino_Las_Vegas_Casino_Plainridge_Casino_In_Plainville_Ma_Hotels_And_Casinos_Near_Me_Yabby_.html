<p>Real Madrid Coming to Finland as Odds-On Favorite</p>
<p>Los Blancos are coming to Helsinki as huge favorites in bookies’ eyes. No surprise there as this team is the champion of the Champions League, the most elite competition in club soccer. They were superb last season and their squad for the 2022-23 season looks even stronger.</p>
<p>During the summer transfer window, Los Blancos signed two pretty decent players. Antonio Rudiger (central defender) arrived from Chelsea, while Aurelien Tchouameni (midfielder) signed from AS Monaco. Plus, several Real Madrid players have returned from a loan, most notably Brazilian midfielder Reiner who played for Borussia Dortmund last season.</p>
<p>Some of these guys might get a chance to play on Wednesday evening. But even in coach Carlo Ancelotti doesn’t put them on the pitch, Los Blancos should still be able to put on a decent performance.</p>
<p>Can Eintracht Frankfurt Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt won the Europa League a few months ago by beating Glasgow Rangers in the final. Before that, they defeated several big teams, including West Ham and Barcelona. Can they do the same against Real Madrid?</p>
<p>One thing going in their favor is that their players are fit and ready for the game, considering that the German Bundesliga has already started. What’s not going in their favor is that their form isn’t great. At least not judging by what we saw from them in their first game of the season – Bayern Munich destroyed them 6-1 in the Bundesliga opener.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Eintracht Frankfurt Prediction</p>
<p>Real Madrid players are just way better than Eintracht Frankfurt. That said, anything but a win in the 90 minutes would be a huge surprise. Still, you can be certain that the Germans are going to fight back and try to score a goal of two. That said, a spectacle is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Picks: Real Madrid to win; over 3.5 goals</p>
