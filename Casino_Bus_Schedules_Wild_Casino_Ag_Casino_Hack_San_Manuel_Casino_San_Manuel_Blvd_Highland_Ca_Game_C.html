    <h1>Casino Bus Schedules Wild Casino Ag Casino Hack San Manuel Casino San Manuel Blvd Highland Ca Game C</h1>

<p>Hi, on 28th of july i've made an account in suprabets and deposited 600€ after i placed a bet on 2 teams with most of that money, however one game wasn't played and the 2nd one won so i only profited about 40€</p>
<p>After that i went to play some blackjack (single player blackjack) and wagered a good amount of money however i ended up losing quite a bit, then got back to where i started from and stopped.</p>
<p>After that i played roulette in live casino and profited 100-150€ (can't exactly remember)</p>
<p>I then bet on an esports game (On heroic, whos the top 1 team in counter strike currently and was playing in a 1m prizepool tournament) and ended up winning 1100-1200€, after that i tried to make a withdrawal but it told me that i needed to verify my account first before i can do that, so i uploaded my documents (ID proof and address proof, i submitted my id card and bank statement that includes my address)</p>
<p>After that i played a bit more live roulette to win about 100€ more to get to exactly 2k € balance and i managed to do that, after that i went to sleep since i had to wait for my verification to be finished before i can withdraw.</p>
<p>The next day my account was verified (All documents i submitted showed as 'verified') and i could make a withdrawal, i assumed it would receive it instantly (as it says skrill deposits/withdrawals are instant) but i didn't, support told me i had to wait up to 24 hours so i did.</p>
<p>The next day (30th) my withdrawal was declined and the message said that my account was under review.</p>
<p>I messaged support about it and they said that i had to wait up to 24 hours again to get a response so i did and i did not get any response for 24 hours so today i messaged support about it with this message:</p>
<p>"Hello, i made a withdrawal 2 days ago which was rejected yesterday, i was told that it was because my account is under review, I then emailed info@suprabets.com asking about why that is the case and that my account was verified and the reply i just got an automatic reply back saying that i need to verify my account and that it can take up to 24 hours but i've literally already verified my account 3 days ago (and it says verified for all documents i submitted) please give me an update."</p>
<p>The reply i got from them was that i needed to email them, basically ignoring my question or giving me any meaningful answer but to my surprise literally less than 2 minutes after that message i got a reply to my email, which says:</p>
<p>"Dear player,</p>
<p>Your account has been flagged for violating our terms and conditions point 11.5</p>
<p>In accordance with our terms we will close your account</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>SB team"</p>
<p>When i saw this message i was beyond shocked, especially after i could not login to my account anymore. How could i have possible violated any terms/conditions when i've barely played on the site? 11.5 in their terms of conditions says this:</p>
<p>11.5 For the purposes of this paragraph 11:</p>
<p>I then checked paragraph 11 and it says:</p>
<ol>
<li>COLLUSION, CHEATING, FRAUD AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</li>
</ol>
<p>which is beyond ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>How could i have possible cheated/comitted any fraud when my gameplay was perfectly normal? i played single player blackjack (and in a very normal way, just did 15-30€ bets for the most part) and live roulette (again my gameplay was perfectly normal, i bet on quite a lot of numbers but more on some of them that i felt were gonna hit)</p>
<p>And in sports betting, I bet on 3 teams in total, one game was canceled, one (that was in a 2 way combo) won, where i only won about 40€ and then on map 2 and 3 on Heroic vs Themongolz (Won the most from that and it was the biggest game of them all, 1m prizepool tournament, top 1 team playing vs top 20 team) That is literally all.</p>
<p>And to answer any obvious questions (to hopefully speed this up):</p>
<p>1) I have never had an account on this site before (in fact i never even heard about it until a week ago, found it advertised on a site that shows odds for different games, sports, esports) and i saw that it has a good rating here in casino.guru so i decided to register after seeing that it has instant deposits/withdrawals for a couple payment methods and quite a lot of playable games in casino and also a lot of markets in sports.</p>
<p>2) I never took any bonus when i registered and i don't in any site since the rollover / terms &amp; conditions for these bonuses are usually quite unfair (at least for me)</p>
<p>3) I was fully cooperating with them, sent my documents to verify myself when they asked (as i know this is a common procedure) patiently waited the 24 hours when support told me that's how long it can take to get an answer.</p>
<p>I really hope this can get solved as fast as possible, the last time i had a problem with another casino and made a complaint here, it ended up getting solved, however it took a while (as the casino replied quite slowly) I really hope this gets solved asap.</p>
