<p>The deal will allow PENN to broadly engage hockey fans, develop compelling integrations and uniquely leverage NHL programming</p>
<p>PENN Entertainment unveiled a major new partnership deal with the National Hockey League (NHL). Under the deal, PENN’s ESPN BET brand in the United States and theScore Bet brand in Ontario will serve as official sports betting partners of the league.</p>
<p>As the NHL’s official partners, ESPN BET and theScore Bet will receive access to NHL IP rights, as well as a number of media and marketing integrations across league programming. The two brands will be promoted across the NHL, cementing them as powerhouses in their respective markets.</p>
<p>PENN’s entitlements will begin immediately, according to the official release, and span the NHL regular season, Stanley Cup Playoffs, 2024 NHL Winter Classic, 2024 NHL Stadium Series and 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the collaboration will include certain integrity-related initiatives.</p>
<p>PENN’s ESPN BET hit the market two weeks ago, quickly cementing itself as a leading brand across 17 states. The brand pairs ESPN’s brand reach with PENN Entertainment’s gambling experience to deliver an outstanding experience to sports bettors.</p>
<p>An Exciting Opportunity for Both PENN and the NHL</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the deal, with Jason Jazayeri, the NHL’s vice president of business development, saying that it will see the league as one of ESPN BET’s first partners.</p>
<p>From day one we’ve said our media rights deal with ESPN and The Walt Disney Company has been a big win for our fans and our League, and this new collaboration is further testament to the value of our partnership. Jason Jazayeri, VP of business development, NHL</p>
<p>Jazayeri added that the NHL is “younger, faster and more exciting than ever.” He believes that these qualities will help it deliver thrilling, yet safe, gaming experiences to fans alongside ESPN BET and theScore Bet.</p>
<p>Aubrey Levy, Penn Interactive’s senior vice president of marketing and content, also commented on the partnership, saying that the ESPN BET launch was one of the company’s most exciting recent developments. Levy is glad to celebrate this launch with a partnership with the NHL and further expand the brand.</p>
<p>Becoming an official partner allows us to more broadly engage hockey fans, develop compelling integrations and uniquely leverage NHL programming. This is also a key partnership for theScore Bet in Ontario, where the popularity of hockey is unmatched. Aubrey Levy, SVP of marketing and content, Penn Interactive</p>
<p>Speaking of PENN, the company just held a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of its new hotel in Columbus.</p>
