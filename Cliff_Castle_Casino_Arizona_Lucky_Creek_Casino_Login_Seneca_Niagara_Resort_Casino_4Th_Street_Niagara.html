<p>Genius Sports, a provider of official data, broadcasts and tech to the sports betting industry has become the official data partner of the Australian Professional Leagues (APL). The agreement will see the supplier help protect the sports ecosystem from harm and fraud.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Pens a Data and Integrity Agreement</p>
<p>Under the deal with the APL, Genius Sports will become the exclusive official data partner of the Isuzu UTE A-League Men (ALM) and the Liberty A-League Women (ALW) for the 2022-23 season. The agreement will see Genius Sports leverage its predictive algorithms and sports odds to identify and report suspicious betting behavior. This monitoring system will provide the leagues with a much-needed fraud prevention scheme. In addition, Genius Sports will provide the ALM and ALW with educational services.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Australian leagues will provide Genius Sports with the exclusive right to capture, manage and distribute official data from all A-Leagues matches. As a result, the provider will be able to power its partnering sports betting operators across the world with official data from the ALM and ALW.</p>
<p>The A-Leagues also plan to deploy Genius Sports’ optical tracking system in several venues at a later date. More news will be announced as the season progresses.</p>
<p>The APL Welcomed Genius Sports as Its Partner</p>
<p>Michael Tange, director of strategy and digital for the Australian Professional Leagues, spoke about the new agreement. He lauded Genius Sports as an undisputed global leader in data and integrity services. Because of that, Tange said, the APL team is looking forward to building a strong relationship with the provider. He concluded that Genius Sports’ data capabilities are sure to help the APL excel at what it does.</p>

<p>John Curzon, Genius Sports’ head of Australasia – Sportech, also shared his thoughts. He noted that Australian soccer is growing rapidly with more and more people following the scene by the day.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be partnering with the A-Leagues at this critical stage of its global expansion, connecting Australian football with millions of fans around the world as their exclusive official data partner. John Curzon, head of Australasia – Sportech</p>
<p>Genius Sports is also the official data and integrity partner to many of the world’s top sports leagues. The company has existing agreements with the United States National Football League and the English Premier League, among others.</p>
<p>A week ago, Genius Sports was able to finally solve its legal dispute with Sportradar, a sports tech company.</p>
