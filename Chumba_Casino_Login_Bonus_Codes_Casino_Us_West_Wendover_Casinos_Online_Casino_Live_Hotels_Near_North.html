<p>Evolution, the acclaimed supplier and developer of the world’s finest live casino content, has debuted a new live game show, Funky Time. The game is set in a 70s disco theme and offers players a gripping, exciting and immersive experience that has become the signature style for the company and the way it creates products.</p>
<p>Funky Time is now touted as the biggest new game show since the release of Crazy Time, another Evolution original. The new game will feature a live presenter who will "celebrate the iconic disco era" and stream from a studio that has been fitted to give off a notable retro ambience, with funky beats, and dancefloor moves – the works.</p>
<p>Central to the game is the DigiWheel money wheel that will offer random multipliers every round with players winning on numbers, letters, or bonus games. The wheel offers various ways to access awards, with the words PLAY, FUNK and TIME written on different segments of the wheel itself. There are four unique bonus games, which are a throwback to some of the biggest hits in disco music and culture.</p>
<p>The bonus levels include "Stayin’ Alive," "Disco," "VIPDisco," and "Bar." These games come with guaranteed multipliers which is a great way to enjoy the game, safe in the knowledge that some extra payouts may be on the way. Similar to MONOPOLY Live, Evolution features a unique animated character for this new game as well.</p>
<p>Mr Funky will be joining the virtual dance floor to help collect more multipliers. Commenting on this fresh release, Evolution CPO Todd Haushalter was excited to introduce the game to fans and the industry. Haushalter has always been personally involved with the releases and their introduction and Evolution has taken meticulous care to ensure that each new release improves on industry standards.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that Funky Time will achieve similar success," Haushalter said, referring to previous game show releases by the company, including Dream Catcher. "When I first saw the DigiWheel, a big vertical revolving wheel with an electronic LED centre, I knew there was a great game show to be built around it," the executive added.</p>
<p>He hailed the company for the efforts put into crafting this new game and revealed that more than 100 people were involved to make sure that Funky Time goes live and hits the mark. The game, he argues, is a completely different thing from what players have experienced so far.</p>
<p>Evolution recently launched its Live Craps game in Michigan, after the product made successful debuts in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
