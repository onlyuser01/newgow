<p>Blair, known for his exceptional legal acumen, brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the AGS leadership team</p>
<p>AGS, a prominent supplier of slot machines, table games, and interactive gaming solutions to the global casino industry, has announced the appointment of Robert “Bob” Blair as deputy general counsel. This strategic move comes as AGS continues to seize numerous growth opportunities on the horizon.</p>
<p>Bob Blair Joins AGS to Propel Legal Strategy</p>
<p>Rob Ziems, AGS chief legal officer and secretary, expressed his enthusiasm for the addition of Blair to the team, highlighting his extensive background in corporate legal affairs and patent matters. Ziems affirmed that Blair’s expertise will be pivotal in safeguarding and advancing AGS’ business and brand amidst an evolving industry landscape.</p>
<p>Blair’s impressive legal journey spans over two decades. Prior to joining AGS, he held integral roles at Aruze Gaming America, Inc. Most notably, Blair served as global general counsel, global deputy general counsel, and global senior IP counsel within Aruze’s legal structure. His experience extended to overseeing significant transitions within the company, including the transfer of electronic table game assets to Interblock and the pending acquisition of slot operations by Play Synergy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Blair’s professional history boasts engagements as a US patent attorney at EIP, an international patent-focused law firm, and as vice president of patents at Unwired Planet. His contributions were also felt at International Game Technology, where he served as associate general counsel of intellectual property for a substantial period.</p>
<p>AGS Bolsters Legal Team Amid Global Expansion and Growth</p>
<p>In his capacity as deputy general counsel, Blair’s responsibilities will encompass a diverse range of legal matters. These include collaborating with the executive team to ensure adherence to compliance and governance standards. His appointment underlines AGS’ commitment to enhancing its legal foundation and positioning itself optimally for sustained growth.</p>
<p>AGS’s decision to appoint Blair comes at a time of global expansion for the company. As indicated in its Q2 report, AGS successfully extended its presence to 29 US states, four Canadian provinces, and one international jurisdiction outside of North America. This expansion aligns with AGS’ strategic goals of broadening customer reach, particularly among larger corporate clients.</p>
<p>AGS’ chief legal officer Robert Ziems, who Blair will answer to, has not been part of AGS that long either. The company appointed him in February this year, leveraging his 24 years of experience within the sector to enhance the company’s legal and compliance efforts, particularly in Latin America. AGS‘ recent collaboration with DraftKings, expanding online game content offerings, further underscores the company’s forward-looking strategies. With the addition of Robert Blair, AGS stands poised to navigate complex legal landscapes while pursuing its growth trajectory.</p>
