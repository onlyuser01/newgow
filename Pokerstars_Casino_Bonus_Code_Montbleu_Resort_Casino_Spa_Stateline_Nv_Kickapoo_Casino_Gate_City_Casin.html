    <h1>Pokerstars Casino Bonus Code Montbleu Resort Casino Spa Stateline Nv Kickapoo Casino Gate City Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Fatinhoo89,</p>
<p>After thoroughly examining the evidence provided by both the casino and yourself, it appears that the second payment was indeed sent to a different recipient.</p>
<p>You can verify this on your own by checking the casino's company name, which is "Tilaros Limited," and the IBAN that begins with "CY," indicating Cyprus. However, you made the transaction to "Naudapay Limited," with an IBAN that starts with "GB," indicating Great Britain.</p>
<p>The casino has confirmed that they do not have such a bank account. I kindly request that you review your transaction history in your bank and search for the given IBAN. It is possible that you may be familiar with the account holder.</p>
<p>Additionally, it seems that the transaction was declined at the casino's end and they never received the funds. The reason the transaction attempt was recorded in your casino account is that you deposited through a pop-up window in which you logged into your bank and likely selected a different recipient.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, based on the evidence provided by both parties, it is clear that the mistake was made on your side.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you did not comply with my request to provide full bank statements in their original format, instead sending only edited screenshots.</p>
<p>I apologize, but the complaint will be rejected once again. There is nothing more we can do to assist or resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
