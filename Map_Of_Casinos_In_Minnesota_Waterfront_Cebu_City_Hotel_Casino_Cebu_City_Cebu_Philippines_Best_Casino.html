<p>888 Holdings, the parent company of a variety of gambling brands, has reinforced its leadership team with the addition of Anna Barsby. The new appointee will serve as the operator’s new chief product and technology officer.</p>
<p>Barsby Joins 888 as CPTO</p>
<p>Barsby brings in years of experience. She is currently a non-executive director at Cumberland Building Society and also the founder and managing partner of the management consultancy Tessiant. Prior to her current occupations, Barsby worked for a variety of companies, occupying various leadership and tech-related positions.</p>
<p>As noted by 888, Barsby is a “digital expert with a huge breadth of experience in digital transformation and integration.” The company lauded her experience, praising her outstanding track record of leading transformative projects for companies such as Halfords and Morrisons. 888 Holdings noted that Barsby was able to help significantly boost these brands, greatly expanding their market share.</p>
<p>As a part of 888, the new hire will be responsible for overseeing the tech integration in the wake of 888’s acquisition of William Hill this year. Barsby will be tasked with making said integration as beneficial as possible while improving customer experience.</p>
<p>888 Holdings Wants to Finalize the William Hill Integration</p>
<p>Itai Pazner, 888 Holdings’ chief executive officer, welcomed the new appointee to the company. He emphasized that Barsby has all the skills needed to help the company grow and evolve. Pazner reasserted that the new chief product and technology officer will play an integral part in the key area of technology integration as part of the combination with William Hill. The CEO concluded that the new hire’s experience makes her an important asset for growing the company.</p>
<p>Her significant experience and expertise will be invaluable as we seek to unlock the significant potential of our two highly complementary businesses, and we very much look forward to working with her. Itai Pazner, CEO, 888 Holdings</p>
<p>Pazner recently spoke about 888’s current position and the company’s outstanding debts. While the CEO never regretted the William Hill acquisition, the strategic move still strained 888 Holdings’ finance. In addition, the company’s debts left it vulnerable to the macroeconomic situation and the higher rates set by banks across the globe. Despite the setbacks, 888 remains bullish on paying back around a quarter of the money it owes within the next few weeks or months. Pazner is certain that 888’s potential “remains exciting” and that a bright future awaits the company.</p>
<p>Following Pazner’s statement, 888 Holdings updated its expansion strategy for the US market, highlighting the importance of the iGaming vertical.</p>
