<p>Evolution’s Ezugi announced on Thursday that it received studio and security certificates from the UK Gambling Commission for 11 of its games. As a result, the highly-popular games are now fully certified and ready to launch in the UK market.</p>
<p>11 Ezugi Games Are Now Fully Certified from the GC in the UK</p>
<p>The GC approval marks an important step for Ezugi that expands further its licensing and operating market. The highly-popular titles that received approval target a broad audience of consumers and operators. The company explained that the titles aim to be attractive for people who are into “traditional and well-known casino games” as well as “those who are looking for more localized offerings.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to mark such a significant milestone and look forward to providing our best games to UK players,” reads a statement released by Ezugi</p>
<p>Those titles include the well-known Baccarat, Roulette, Auto-Roulette, Blackjack, and Unlimited Blackjack. The users will also be able to enjoy the top-performing Dragon Tiger, Teen Patti, Bet on Teen Patti, Lucky 7, as well as Ezugi’s most recent title Cricket War.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Ezugi has been a part of Evolution since 2018. The recent licensing in the UK market complements ongoing growth for the company across Europe. Last year, the company expanded its presence significantly in Italy by inking a strategic deal with Sisal, the gaming lottery giant. Moreover, Ezugi inked another key deal for the Italian market by joining forces with BLOX.</p>
<p>The Licensing Marks a Significant Step for the Company in the UK</p>
<p>Ezugi’s business development director, Pang Goh, acknowledged that licensing the 11 games marks an important step for the company. He said that collecting the certificates from the GC complements Ezugi’s ongoing strategy to “reach the absolute highest industry standards.”</p>
<p>“This is a very significant step for Ezugi and its growth.” Pang Goh, business development director at Ezugi</p>
<p>Goh explained that the company’s license is acquired under Evolution Malta Limited but Ezugi is pleased to have its best games certified. According to him, Ezugi’s localized and innovative game content will be well received by the UK operators. Moreover, he acknowledged that those titles will bring benefits for the operators.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to this next chapter and to provide our best performing games to UK players,” Pang Goh, business development director at Ezugi</p>
<p>In conclusion, Goh outlined that Ezugi is looking forward to the next chapter of its growth in the UK market by providing its best games to customers in the country. Undoubtedly, the recent licensing will help Ezugi continue growing its presence in the UK and Europe.</p>
