    <h1>Movies In Red Rock Casino Kiowa Casino Hotel Casino In Cherokee North Carolina Casino Heist Fingerpr</h1>

<p>This casino is an absolute joke . It’s so corrupt I could be sick. Blatant scams and ethics violations, rude customer support , rigged games and they refuse to comp or refund or even accept any responsibilities and just continue to place blame every and anywhere they can point to instead of just being upfront and honest . First issue I was playing live poker won a few games in a row no issue . I go to begin a new game and all of a sudden I’m unable to join a game and site keeps freezing .. I close every app including browser .. clear history and cache and attempt it 20+ more tries before finally giving up and then because I couldn’t get in the game I wanted to play they forced me into playing slots .. upon playing I hit a bonus round to spin this wheel for a prize .. I hit 70x and it just sat there on the 70 for 45 sec-1min and then flashes and now it’s only at 9x and it hurries up and pays out the weak ass prize when it was clearly obvious I landed on 70 and the 9 wasn’t any where in sight but just poof it switches up the amount followed by me not being able to get another winning spin before they drained the rest of my balance I had.. then I tried dealing with customer service what a joke that was .. they refused to award me my actual winnings or even refund or comp for the money lost or the inconvenience I had to deal with so I warned them if they don’t I was closing my account and would be coming here to expose them and deter as many people as possible away from these scam artist crooks</p>
