<p>North Wales Live reported that after the medical tribunal panel concluded that Dr Aled Jones had gained adequate insight into his conviction, he was reinstated to the medical register following an 18-month suspension.</p>
<p>Medical Tribunal Panel Lifts Suspension of Dr Jones After Extensive Remediation</p>
<p>The medical tribunal panel acknowledged that Dr Jones had received two job offers, and if he accepted either, he would work under supervision. They determined that Dr Jones had undergone extensive remediation, making it improbable that he would re-offend. Consequently, the panel lifted his suspension with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Dr Jones voluntarily worked on Covid wards during the pandemic and worked as a vaccinator in Cardiff with his salary paid into a joint account with his father. He also did more than 600 hours of voluntary shifts for renal transplants. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he drove an ambulance across the Ukrainian border to deliver medical aid. During his tribunal, Dr Jones said he hoped that his charitable work had paid his debt to society and the profession.</p>
<p>Former Doctor’s Addiction to In-Play Betting Causes Significant Losses and Professional Consequences</p>
<p>Dr. Jones had developed an addiction that had previously caused him to lose GBP800,000 ($982,716). He made his first bet at university when he gambled on a World Cup accumulator. He recalled a particularly dark moment when he gambled GBP10,000 ($12,284) on the US Open tennis final between Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro. His addiction later saw him betting on sports he did not enjoy watching, such as volleyball. He would bet in-play, which he described as a “real buzz”. He later sought counseling for his addiction and repaid the money he had stolen from the NHS.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Dr Jones expressed his conviction that he would not revert to his previous criminal behavior and assured the panel that he could not fathom becoming a dishonest individual again. Although he acknowledged that he could not undo the serious harm he had inflicted on the profession and the public’s trust, he made sincere efforts to atone and rehabilitate himself. However, the hospital where he previously worked, Cardiff and Vale University health board, refuted claims that they had offered him a job.</p>
