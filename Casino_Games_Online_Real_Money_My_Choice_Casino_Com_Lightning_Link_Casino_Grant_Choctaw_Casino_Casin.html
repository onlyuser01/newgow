<p>Relax Gaming, a popular iGaming content developer and aggregator, has penned a new partnership deal with Octopus Global, a UK-based iGaming solutions startup. Under the agreement, Octopus Global will join Relax Gaming as the latest Powered By studio partner.</p>
<p>Octopus Becomes a Powered By Partner</p>
<p>Octopus Gaming is one of the newest names in iGaming. The company was founded in October 2022 but has big ambitions to become a leading force in iGaming. Octopus developed its own remote gaming server (RGS) that has all the boons of a robust and modern architecture while still providing a flexible end-to-end gaming solution.</p>
<p>While Octopus Global is a fairly new entity, it serves as the host to the full portfolio of Rogue, a veteran iGaming developer. Thanks to this, the startup is able to offer player-favorite iGaming releases such as Happily Ever After, Rave Up and Wildfire West. Rogue’s experienced team is also behind Octopus’ RGS.</p>
<p>The games developed by Rogue are loved for the distinct mechanics that make them truly unique. Proprietary functions such as Wildfire, Destiny and Rainblox Reels help players experience an unparalleled thrill while boosting their chances to win big prizes.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Was a Primary Partner for the Startup</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s director of casino, spoke about the new deal. She said that Relax Gaming is thrilled to have Octopus join the list of Powered By Relax partners. Hannah said that Octopus’ ambitions and integration speed are nothing short of impressive.</p>
<p>It’s clear to us that they have a big future ahead of them. We’ve been particularly impressed with the speed of integration, Octopus technology and of course their fantastic portfolio of Rogue games. Shelley Hannah, director of casino, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Octopus Global’s chief commercial officer, John Parsonage, said that he has personally worked with Relax Gaming for many years. Thanks to that, he is well aware of the aggregator’s excellent team and technology, which is why he wanted them as a primary partner of Octopus Global. He explained that Relax’s distribution capabilities will complement Octopus Global’s content well.</p>
<p>The extensive reach and distribution opportunities provided by Relax complement the advanced tech and innovative slot content provided by that of Octopus Global. This partnership enables us to provide unique Rogue games content to operators in key regulated markets worldwide. John Parsonage, CCO, Octopus Global</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is one of the biggest names in iGaming content. The company is famed as one of the best suppliers in the industry, which is further attested by the numerous award it has received at various industry fairs.</p>
<p>A week ago, Relax unveiled a new agreement with Gran Madrid, agreeing to supply it with products. A day earlier, the company launched Hot Rod Racers, an exciting new slot game.</p>
