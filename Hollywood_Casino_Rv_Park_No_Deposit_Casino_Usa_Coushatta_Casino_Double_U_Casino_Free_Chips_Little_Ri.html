    <h1>Hollywood Casino Rv Park No Deposit Casino Usa Coushatta Casino Double U Casino Free Chips Little Ri</h1>

<p>The fast-growing iGaming company founded in 2008, ComeOn Group, confirmed a new strategic appointment, strengthening its senior management team. The company unveiled last week that it selected Owen Parry for the role of Head of Customer Engagement. While previously, he led ComeOn's proposition team, in his new role, will oversee the customer engagement function for the company. Additionally, he will be in charge of the company's portfolio of markets, as well as brands.</p>
<p>Appointing Parry to the role of Head of Customer Engagement complements ComeOn's plan for the growth of its sportsbook and bringing personalized services along with real-time CRM. Ultimately, those solutions deliver thrilling, unique and at the same time safe experiences for the players.</p>
<p>Sherwin Jarvand, ComeOn Group's Chief Data Officer, shared his excitement about the latest appointment in a statement saying: "We are very proud to promote from within again for a key role in ComeOn’s future." Finally, he pointed out: "Offering a best-in-class player engagement across all our customer’s touch points is always at the front of our minds and with Owen leading this area now, we are in safe hands to take this strategic goal to the next level."</p>
<p>The latest appointment comes on the heels of another important recent announcement from ComeOn. Late in May, the company confirmed it expanded its offering in the Netherlands via ComeOn.nl with the addition of Live Casino games from the famous iGaming developer, Pragmatic Play. The collaboration saw the iGaming provider strengthen ComeOn's offering in the country, delivering thrilling products that have proven their popularity around the globe.</p>
<p>Before that, in April, ComeOn confirmed it secured ISO 27001 certification, recognizing its leading Information Security Management System. The aforementioned certification is a testament to the efforts of companies that seek to ensure the protection of customer data and improve user experiences.</p>
<p>Strengthening its C-suite is a part of ComeOn's People Strategy. In fact, the ambitious plan seeks to identify internal talent, ensuring a successful career path through internal promotions. Parry's promotion is one such strategic move and follows other recent appointments announced in the last six months.</p>
<p>Another internal promotion that follows ComeOn's People Strategy is the one of Matthew Cawston who was selected for the role of Director of Marketing Operations. Similarly, the company recently selected Robert Rothman for the role of Director of Performance Marketing, further strengthening its senior-level management.</p>
