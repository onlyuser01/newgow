<p>Sportradar has become the exclusive betting data collector and supplier of the Union of European Football Associations or UEFA. The sports data company won a public tender, proving it can deliver on the best product, courtesy of a global focus on the integrity of sports and the ability to collate big data for the needs of various leagues, teams, and tournaments.</p>
<p>As a result of its latest partnership, Sportradar will have access to 1,500 matches played in the 2021/2022 season through the 2023/2024 season. Among those are games from UEFA Euros 2024, UEFA Women’s League, and UEFA Nations League, giving Sportradar a big spread of events it can provide actionable data about.</p>
<p>Sportradar a Second-to-None Choice for UEFA</p>
<p>Sportradar CEO Carsten Koerl was confident in his company’s ability to deliver on the expected quality of product, arguing that Sportradar is one of the best-known and most successful data collectors when it comes to soccer matches.</p>
<p>Sportradar has been forging its reputation and legacy as a big tech company that can leverage the information it collects to cater to a number of stakeholders’ needs. Koerl was adamant about what Sportradar’s capabilities were:</p>
<p>“We’re the only organization with the technological capabilities and unique resources to truly support the growth of one of the biggest federations in global sport.” Sportradar CEO Carsten Koerl</p>
<p>Koral added that soccer remained the leading sport worldwide and that Sportradar was capable to meet UEFA’s expectations. Through Sportradar’s expertise, UEFA will be able to bolster its engagement and channels of communication with the betting industry.</p>
<p>Sportradar will also operate in its own ballpark by continuing to exercise one of its main focuses, which is protecting the integrity of the game. The company has a dedicated Intelligence and Investigative Services division which has been fighting tooth and nail to clamp down on fraud on all levels of sports.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s Focus on Integrity to Help UEFA with Betting</p>
<p>Sportradar has repeatedly targeted and flagged second division leagues along with the biggest events out there. Expanding its scope of operation, Sportradar chose to make its fraud detection system free giving interested parties the tools necessary to improve integrity and continue to deliver on spotless competitions.</p>
<p>The company was similarly awarded the Data Standards Kitemark, an accreditation issued by the International Betting Integrity Association’s (IBIA), which testifies to the company’s quality assurance standards and processes. UEFA marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein has welcomed the news of Sportradar joining the ranks of the organization.</p>
<p>As UEFA made sports betting brand bwin its first official betting operator, the union is looking to better understand how betting can influence and impact UEFA’s offer for the better without detracting from the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>“The combination of the two partnerships allows UEFA to engage more openly with the sports betting sector, giving greater access to market intelligence and support from both a sports integrity and a commercial perspective,” Epstein concluded.</p>
