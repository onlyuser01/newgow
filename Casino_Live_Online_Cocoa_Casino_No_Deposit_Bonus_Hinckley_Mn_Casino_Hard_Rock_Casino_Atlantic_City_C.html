<p>Thai Blossoms Slot Machine Review</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms is set in the lush green kingdom of Thailand where you will see scenic villages and richly adorned elephants, wildflowers, and so much more come together to bring you a slot game that pays out 96.24% on average and creates a compelling experience. The game is not just about its crisp graphics, as Betsoft is usually known for.</p>
<p>In fact, Thai Blossoms slot is building a great underpinning theme and executing it nicely. You may win 922x off your bet, enjoy Free Spins and Sticky Wilds that stack, and so much more. We have taken a close look at what is one of the best slot games you will find that features nature, animals, and the kingdom’s breathtaking scenery!</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms Theme and Setting: Dive into the Exotic</p>
<p>The theme and setting of Thai Blossoms doesn’t claim to be outstanding but we think it is. You are introduced to the Thai outdoors, where the occasional traditional houses are huddling amongst the lush greenery, and against a backdrop of towering mountains, streams crisscrossing neat earthy paths, and more. There are neat elements of the design here such as fireflies and leaves dropping, as the reels spin with finesse.</p>
<p>In terms of symbols, there are tropical fruit and letters which serve the purposes of high and low-paying elements respectively, and help you further immerse yourself in the setting of this outstanding slot. We really enjoy the soft clink and chiming of the reels as they spin and clank into place, and there are some of the locals to welcome you, including an exotic-looking lady with a flower in her head.</p>
<p>Each of the symbols comes across on the reels is meant to add to the authenticity of the overall experience, with a cracked coconut, a bunch of letters, and all sorts of nice and salivating fruit available.</p>
<p>There is an Elephant who will trumpet its trunk if you get him on the reels, even if you don’t trigger anything particular with him, which we find nice as well! All in all, Betsoft delivers on the setting and overall feel with Thai Blossoms slot machine.</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms is here to help you have fun while playing. This starts with the available symbols, which will spread across 100 possible paylines. Players get to win between 32 and 16 for five of A, K, Q, J, and 10. Some of the higher paying symbols here, the passion fruit and coconuts will offer 100-48, depending on which one you get and if you get five of those.</p>
<p>There is also a special Buy Feature Symbol that is not part of the grid but rather sits by it and you can enter the level any time you wish. Mind that this feature may not always be available in all jurisdictions, but this is okay. The Scatter Symbol is an elephant as we already mentioned, and the free spins you can get will vary, with the maximum being 20. Oh, and the exotic flower is actually a wild symbol and the exotic-looking lady is simply a high-paying symbol that can reward a 400 payout for five of a kind.</p>
<p>Besides this, there isn’t too much else to see in terms of symbols here, but we enjoy how things are kept nice and on point to bring you the most worthwhile gameplay moments.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations: Quaint and Scenic</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms has built a game that will reward you with great graphics, and subtle tunes that add incrementally to the experience. Players get to enjoy an experience that stays with them long after they stop spinning the reels. Everything about the design is set to make sure that you are having a great experience with subtle and smooth gameplay that is further accentuated by the visual strokes Betsoft uses adroitly to make it worth your while.</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms Gameplay: Set the Bet and Spin!</p>
<p>There isn’t anything complicated about Thai Blossoms. The game invites you to set your bets and spin the reels quickly and easily. Players will enjoy a quick journey around the reels, with bets available to adjust through the minus and plus symbols, and an auto spin and quick spin options readily available.</p>
<p>The spin button is prominent and easy to trigger. You can also set and preload a bunch of rounds just like that and have a great time. Navigation is easy even if you are playing on mobile, allowing you to take the Thai Blossoms slot with you on the go.</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms Features: Free Spins &amp; Bonus Buy</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms is just a little vanilla when it comes to its overall variety of game features, but this doesn’t detract from the game’s charm. There are two main features you can benefit from here.</p>
<p>Free Spins: You can claim up to 20 free spins triggered with the Gilded Elephant, making it easy for you to enjoy some extra freebies along the way and have fun while at it. Players need three Scatter Symbols to join the stampede and have a blast!</p>
<p>Bonus Buy: Bonus Buy is another way for you to access a little more a little sooner when playing Thai Blossoms. The Bonus Buy feature may not be available in all markets, but it will surely prove a great boon to have when looking to play and max out your value from the game!</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Revel in Thailand’s Scenery!</p>
<p>Thai Blossoms will make you fall in love with the Thai scenery, and maybe even tempt you to travel there. Don’t rush off packing your suitcases though, as you need not hurry as there is a fantastic slot game to try first. With medium volatility, a maximum 922x payout, and a 96.24% payout percentage you are looking at a seriously cool and rewarding game.</p>
