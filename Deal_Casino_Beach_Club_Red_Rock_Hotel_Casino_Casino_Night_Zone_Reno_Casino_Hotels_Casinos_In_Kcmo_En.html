<p>New Jersey became the center stage for another gaming sector company’s debut last week after the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) granted Enteractive with a service license, the global leader in player reactivation and retention announced in a press release.</p>
<p>Preparing Conversion Campaigns</p>
<p>Following the decision by the DGE, Enteractive, which ranks in the top 4 global revenue generators for the iGaming industry and has more than 12 years of player reactivation experience, will soon launch conversion campaigns in the state, targeting both existing and new clients.</p>
<p>“This license confirming our operations in New Jersey marks our landfall in the US, and we’re extremely excited and eager to progress our US activities for our operator partners. As we grow and expand into new states and US markets, we look forward to finding a second home on US soil for our business.” Mikael Hansson, CEO, Enteractive</p>
<p>The service license allows Enteractive’s personalized CRM with two-way conversations available as for sports betting, so for casino players, to be deployed starting from April 2021 and the reactivation and retention specialist said it already began preparations for an existing US client, while other gaming operators also expressed interest in its services.</p>
<p>“Entering a new market such as the US demands 20:20 visibility on keeping players safe and enjoying iGaming entertainment responsibly. Without the players, our industry is nothing, so we must ensure they remain the focus of our activities with a sustainable approach.” Mikael Hansson, CEO, Enteractive</p>
<p>Following the license approval, the company’s (Re)Activation Cloud platform launched in 2017 to offer integration between selected player databases and the option to call players directly, will help Enteractive showcase its capabilities and seamlessly scalable services.</p>
<p>Platform Call Capabilities and Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>The platform supports expandable call campaign efforts for any jurisdiction around the world, utilizing an API software interface to connect teams at Enteractive with any operator’s client database with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Besides reactivation call campaigns, Enteractive’s platform capabilities allow it to act as the first line of protection in terms of problem gambling as every call made to a player has responsible gaming at its core.</p>
<p>Enteractive has been recently awarded for the third time in a row certification for its responsible gambling practices by Global Gambling Guidance Group (G4), to mark another milestone for the company for its efforts to put responsible gambling at the center of its revenue generation activities for partner operators.</p>
