<p>One of the biggest international developers of gaming technologies, NOVOMATIC AG Group, announced it was recently recognized with a prestigious award. The company confirmed that its innovative NOVOVISION Casino Management System (CMS) secured a win at the 2023 European Casino Awards, an event that distinguishes leading products and operators within the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>This year's edition of the event, organized by Datateam Business Media, the publisher of Casino International, coincided with the ICE London 2023 and took place early in February at the Grand Connaught Rooms in London's Covent Garden. Overall, European Casino Awards recognized leading operators within the casino industry in 21 different categories such as industry achievement, products, and more.</p>
<p>Participating in the event, NOVOMATIC's NOVOVISION CMS was designated as the winner within the Best CMS/Software Product category. The leading system from NOVOMATIC Biometric Systems (NBS) was recognized for its innovative technology that delivers revolutionary efficiencies to casino management. Moreover, the solution offers multiple features that make it appealing to casino operators.</p>
<p>In a statement, NBS' Sales Director, Jens Einhaus, shared his excitement saying: "We are absolutely thrilled with this award." He pointed out that the award complements the commitment and efforts of the company's team to develop a solution that differentiates itself by delivering unique features. In conclusion, Einhaus said: "Operator feedback at ICE was excellent, and we see huge international potential for the further growth of our market share."</p>
<p>The latest award further complements the growth of NOVOMATIC. As a leading international software and gaming technologies developer, currently, the company has approximately 21,900 employees around the globe. Additionally, NOVOMATIC has a rich history spanning decades and by now its leading electronic gaming and other solutions are available in 100 countries around the world. What's more, NOVOMATIC currently operates approximately 212,000 video lottery terminals and gaming terminals.</p>
<p>NOVOVISION securing recognition from the European Casino Awards comes as no surprise, considering that it offers extensive features as well as customization options for casino operators. The CMS helps operators ensure compliance with the regulations and at the same time brings convenient tools.</p>
<p>"The NOVOVISION system provides a powerful toolset that allows operators to streamline their processes, increase operational security and maximize the convenience for their guests with the most secure and innovative cashless experience on the market," explains NOVOMATIC.</p>
<p>Companies and operators that use the solution can benefit from accessing analysis options, as well as automation possibilities that operate in line with requirements such as social responsibility and other obligations. Around the world, some 1,300 cash machines, 3,000 betting terminals, as well as 40,000 gaming machines already leverage the leading solution.</p>
