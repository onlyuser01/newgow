    <h1>Rio All Suites Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nv Nc Casinos Murphy Paysbig Potawatomi Bingo Casino Treas</h1>

<p>I am a player who has been playing for a long time and when I lose there is no problem but a couple of weeks ago I made a deposit with crypto coins, which was valid and everything, days later I played slots and won the amount of $4000 usd which is found in my account, when trying to withdraw them, the withdrawal is rejected. And I write to the help email which they answer me that I have to verify a digital card which I used for months and it has nothing to do with the last deposit since it was made with crypto currencies, despite that I send the required information, the first The person who attended me asked me only for the digits and shared the steps to get the digits from Apple Pay, which I sent them the full digits as well as the expiration date and then another person answered me that by the way they are rude and tactless , which will send them the account statement in PDF where the complete card numbers came from, which is impossible because the account statement only shows the digits of the physical card.</p>
<p>Being a virtual card that belongs to a physical one, it does not have its own account statement, the account statement provided by the bank is about the physical one.</p>
<p>There are already more than 10 emails sending information and trying to see how they could help me and they only answer the same thing like robots.</p>
<p>It has lousy customer service.</p>
