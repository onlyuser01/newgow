<p>Elys Game Technology expanded its presence further in Italy. The company announced a deal with Playtech which will bring the developer’s content to its trusted brand Newgioco.</p>
<p>Elys Game Technology Expands Italian Presence via Playtech Agreement</p>
<p>Interactive gaming and sports betting technology company, Elys Game Technology, inked a new content distribution agreement on Monday with the leading gambling software development company Playtech. Under the terms of the collaboration, the Newgioco brand, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elys Game Technology, will integrate and launch digital igaming content from the gaming software developer for the Italian market.</p>
<p>This further expands Elys’ online and mobile casino offering which now hits 31 providers once Playtech is added. Those providers offer some 1,300 slots and 100 live dealer and table games for customers in Italy.</p>
<p>It was back in November 2020 when Newgioco rebranded to Elys Game Technology. The company was already well-known within the Italian and European markets but it was looking to grow globally, which is why it chose to rebrand.</p>
<p>Besides a strong presence in Italy, Elys Game Technology has also entered the US sports betting market. In fact, it was back in September this year when Elys received its first US sports wagering license in DC. Currently, the company is also listed on the NASDAQ.</p>
