<p>Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino believes the future of cyber security lies in the exchange of information and expertise</p>
<p>The European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) announced that Belgian online gambling operator Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino has joined the association’s newly-established expert group on cyber security.</p>
<p>Collaboration on Cyber Security Matters</p>
<p>By joining EGBA’s cyber security expert group, Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino became the first operator not a member of the association to collaborate with the industry’s body on cyber security matters.</p>
<p>Maarten Haijer, Secretary General of EGBA, was excited to welcome “the newest participant to EGBA’s industry group on cyber security” and its Belgian market expertise, highlighting the group as “a valuable platform for operators to share practical information and solutions about the latest cyber security threats and vulnerabilities,” as well as “contribute to a more joined-up industry approach.”</p>
<p>Haijer also used the occasion to turn to other operators which may have an interest in joining the group, asking them to contact EGBA “if they wish to be considered for participation to the group.”</p>
<p>Launched last year by EGBA, the cyber security group seeks to promote among its members the highest standards in cyber security by providing a forum for operators to share information and expertise, together identify the latest online security threats and provide resolutions to potential vulnerabilities to prevent cyber incidents and encourage the implementation of the industry’s best practices.</p>
<p>On behalf of Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino, executive director Tom De Clercq outlined one of the company’s strategic priorities is to provide “a trusted and safe environment” to its players, and that critical to that business objective is to ensure that customer data is secure.</p>
<p>“Today’s increasingly complex and interconnected online gambling environment requires a coordinated response to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks,” De Clercq continued, stressing that the reason for Napoleon to join the cyber security group is “to exchange best practices and help drive initiatives within the industry” that will address online threats and ensure “a safe, secure, and protected entertainment environment to players.”</p>
<p>Comprising cyber security experts from EGBA members, among which some of Europe’s leading online gambling operators, the group operates by a Memorandum of Understanding and is open for participation to all online gambling operators in Europe who are willing to comply with EGBA’s principles aimed at maintaining the highest cyber security standards.</p>
<p>Player Protection from Gambling Harm</p>
<p>Besides protecting player data, EGBA is committed to protecting players from developing gambling harm, and last month came up with a proposal to the European Committee for Standardization, which called for the creation of standard markers for gambling harm.</p>
<p>After a month of contemplation, the Committee for Standardization (CEN) approved the proposal and gave EGBA the green light to begin the development process of these markers.</p>
