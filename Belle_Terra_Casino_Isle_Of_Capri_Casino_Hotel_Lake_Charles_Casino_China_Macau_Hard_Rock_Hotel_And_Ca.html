    <h1>Belle Terra Casino Isle Of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles Casino China Macau Hard Rock Hotel And Ca</h1>

<p>FSB, an award-winning sports betting and iGaming platform provider, has reinforced its team with the addition of the experienced Kenneth Paterson. Paterson will be joining the company as its new global delivery director and will help it cement itself as a Tier 1 supplier.</p>
<p>Paterson’s Valuable Expertise Will Help the Company</p>
<p>Paterson is a seasoned gambling and tech worker with years of experience behind his back. He has previously worked as GVC’s chief enterprise architect for five years. Following that, he joined KiK Interactive as director of architecture where he remained for two years. His most recent experience was as the director of operations and later chief information officer for The New Lottery Company.</p>
<p>As a part of FSB, Paterson will use his experience to coordinate technical procedures and infrastructures. His responsibility will be to make sure everything is executed smoothly and on time. Thus, Paterson will take charge of the company’s Tier 1 delivery projects and manage key SLA requirements for existing clients.</p>
<p>As per FSB’s official statement, it is increasingly important to deliver to its international client base as the company continues to scale across multiple continents. To that end, Paterson will be of invaluable help to the company.</p>
<p>The New Appointee Was “The Clear Choice”</p>
<p>Paterson commented on his new position. He lauded FSB’s recent transformation into a Tier 1 supplier and praised it for pulling that off within a year. Because of that, Paterson noted, it was hardly surprising that FSB managed to score a major EGR award at last month’s event.</p>
<p>Speaking about his new responsibilities, this is what the appointee had to say:</p>
<p>My job now is to build on the vast experience I accrued at GVC and put technical procedures in place to make sure FSB continues to deliver for their rapidly increasing global client base. Kenneth Paterson, global delivery director, FSB</p>
<p>Paterson added that he can’t wait to get started.</p>
<p>Dave McDowell, FSB’s chief executive officer, welcomed Paterson on board. He praised him as “yet another outstanding hire” that joins the company’s growing global tech team. McDowell also said that Paterson was “the clear choice“ for the role.</p>
<p>As we continue to scale across multiple continents, it was clear we needed to recruit a major industry figure to enable us to continue to put delivery at the very top of our focus. Dave McDowell, CEO, FSB</p>
<p>Paterson is not the first ex-GVC employee to join FSB’s team. Earlier, the award-winning company added Keith Laidlaw as a board advisor.</p>
