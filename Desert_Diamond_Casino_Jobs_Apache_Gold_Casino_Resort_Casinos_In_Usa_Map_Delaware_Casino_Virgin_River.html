    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino Jobs Apache Gold Casino Resort Casinos In Usa Map Delaware Casino Virgin River</h1>

<p>Hello there my name is Jovan Smiljanic, my user name on Viperspin is jovansmiljanic1996@outlook.com. I have started playing on Viper spin just a bit over a year now and overall experience for me personally hasent been bad until today. After 33k deposited by me in just a bit over a year and consistant weekly deposits and no withdrawls for over 6 months I finally after depositing hit a big win. From 180 deposite i managed to make about 10k, now with my limit a week being only 4200. Check out this what they did to me. So they have a rule where if you end up winning big and end up reaching weekly limit you have to wait till 7 full days to be able to request a withdrawal. (Talking in Australian time) So on Tuesday last week 19th of 12 2023 at 19:19:00 I made a withdrawal of 2500,than I ended up winning more and i made another withdrawal request on Wednesday mornig 20th of 12 2023, which combined now had a maximum value of 4200 a week i can take out leaving my balance still on over 5k at this stage after performing withdrawals. Thursday around 2pm I had money in my Australian bank account not 2 separate transaction but one transaction of 4200. So now this week I waited for Tuesday on 21:33:11 26th of 12 2023amount 2500 and than I waited for Wednesday 05:56:35 on 27th of 12 2023, which if anybody normal with human sense can calcuate that i have made sure to wait 7 days between the withdrawals, so than I wake up morning today WEDNESDAY in australia right now as i am typing this is 3:28 pm and LAST WEEK at this time my withdrawals have already been done and I was paid, by tomorrow THURSDAY 2pm here in Australia which is in about 23HOURS from me typing this which is when I LAST WEEK AT THIS TIME ALREADY HAD THE MONEY PAID IN MY BANK ACCOUNT , BUT THIS TIME THEY CANCELLED MY WITHDRAWING REQUESTS AFTER I HAVE SPOKEN TO ONLINE SUPPORT MAKING SURE I WAS ABLE TO PERFORM THE REQUEST, ONCE HE CHECKED IT AND CONFIRMED SINCE I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA FOR ME TO MAKE WITHDRAWALS ONLINE STUFF HAS TO CHANGE MY LOCATION WHICH IS WHAT HE DID. THAN I WENT TO EMAILS AND EMAILED SUPPORT ASKING THEM TO PLEASE PROCESS MY REQUEST SO THAT I CAN RECIEVE MONEY IN TIME FOR NEW YEARS WHEN I GET TO HAVE MY DAUGHTER SINCE 5 MONTHS AGO CAUSE I HAD WORK INJURY. THEY WENT AND CANCELLED MY REQUEST CLAIMING I EXCEEDED WEEKLY LIMITS WHICH IS ABSOLUTE LIE. I DO HAVE SCREENSHOTS OF EVERYTHING NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY I AM ABLE TO MAKE WITHDRAWAL ON 29UTC TIME WHICH HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME WHEN I SENT THEM A SCREENSHOT OF ME RECIVING FUNDS ON 21ST OF DECEMBER AUSTRALIAN TIME LAST WEEK. SO WHT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY ARE MAKING YOU STRESS AND WORRY AND ANGRY SO THAT YOU KEEP GAMBLING AS YOU NEED TO GO THRU WITHDRAWING PROCESS AGAIN BUT NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME TO WAIT FOR OVER 8 DAYS SINCE 29UTC IN AUSTRALIA IS 30. AS SOON AS I GET MY FUNDS IF I DO END UP GETTING THEM THEY ARE LOOSING A REGULAR CUSTOMER AND I AM GONNA TAKE MY BUSSINESS ELSE WERE. AND THE LEVEL OF RUDNESS THEY DISPLAY WHEN WRONG AND IN NEED OF MAKING THINGS RIGHT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICOLUS. MY HISTORY FOR ACC IS DEPOSITS: 33.593 AND CASH OUT IS : 18.300 AND I FINALLY GET A GOOD RUN AND THIS "ONLINE CASINO" DOESNT WANT TO PAY ME OR GETS TO MAKE RULES DEPENDING ON WHAT SUITS THEM. PLEASE POST THIS AS I AM AN ACTIVE STREAMER ON KICK AND I WONT STOP JUST ON HERE IF I DONT HEAR BACK FROM THEM. THANK YOU</p>
