<p>Thank you very much for your reply, SeargentSlotty. We accept the situation when the casino allows players from any country to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries (or in this case from a country they do not have a license for) to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well. If the player loses their winnings willingly, we don't think they are entitled to a refund. Unfortunately, we have no authority to enforce the legality of Switzerland's rules.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Please, if there is anything else, we could help you with, do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, we will reject this complaint. Thank you for understanding.</p>
