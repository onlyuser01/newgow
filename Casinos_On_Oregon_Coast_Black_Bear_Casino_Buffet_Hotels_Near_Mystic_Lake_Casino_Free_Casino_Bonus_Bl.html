<p>The 2019-established single standards body for the UK’s betting and gambling industry, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), has given its good wishes to two of its members who have been given important positions in the Labour Shadow Cabinet.</p>
<p>Namely, Thangam Debbonaire MP has been anointed as the new shadow secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport while Stephanie Peacock MP received the honor of being appointed as the new shadow minister for Sport, Gambling and Media.</p>
<p>The Appointments Came at a “Crucial Time” for the Industry</p>
<p>The body that represents more than 90% of all regulated retail betting shops, online betting and gaming operators, as well as casinos and bingo operators, used the voice of chief executive officer Michael Dugher to acknowledge the importance of the two appointments at what he called a “crucial time” for the gambling industry in the UK.</p>
<p>Dugher also took the opportunity to emphasize the support offered by its members to tens of thousands of jobs, alongside their members’ £7.1 billion ($8.8 billion) contribution to the economy and £4.2 billion ($5.2 million) raised in taxes used to support critical public services on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>The BGC, Eager to Work with Debbonaire and Peacock to “Raise Standards”</p>
<p>While busy working on eight separate consultations as a result of the Government’s gambling white paper that was published in April and backed by the body, Dugher explained the BGC was eager to continue its collaboration with both Debbonaire and Peacock in an ongoing effort to keep raising responsible gambling standards, promote safer gambling practices, and make the demands and concerns of bettors and industry workers well heard.</p>
<p>The CEO called their goals to improve safer gambling standards “the bedrock” of their work while explaining their members were currently working hard to complete all their tasks and deliver all proposals established in the white paper. In other words, the BGC is taking advantage of the “once in a generation opportunity to improve standards” and bring important changes for punters and sport.</p>
<p>One of the eight critical consultations is focused on financial risk checks, with the body expressing its support for adopting improved and “frictionless” spending checks for online bettors. The spending checks would be targeted in such a way as to avoid causing more harm to vulnerable players.</p>
<p>The BGC has been collaborating with senior leaders in the horse racing industry who have expressed their concerns that “intrusive financial checks” might damage the sport by interfering with the vast majority of safe and responsible punters.</p>
<p>The body also announced that the current requirement that 20% of TV and radio advertising be devoted to emitting messages promoting safer gambling would be further extended to online forms of advertising.</p>
<p>The BGC has also asked social media giants to partner with them and work on fresh measures that would restrict the marketing from reaching youngsters and problem gamblers.</p>
