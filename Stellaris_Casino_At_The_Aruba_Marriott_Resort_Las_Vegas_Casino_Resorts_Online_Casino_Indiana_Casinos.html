<p>PokerStars Live Dealer Games Expand To Additional Sites</p>

<p>PokerStars live dealer products are spreading across the network’s domains to include .com, .eu, and .uk. The expansion comes after PokerStars.es introduced live dealer play for its casino games earlier last month.</p>
<p>Through its partnership with Latvia-based Evolution Gaming, a leading business-to-business live casino supplier that also works with 888casino and bwin.party, PokerStars’ portfolio of live dealer games currently features roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and casino hold’em.</p>
<p>“PokerStars is already viewed as an authentic, honest and trusted brand in gaming,” says Sam Hobcraft, director of casino gaming for the Rational Group. “We’re now bringing the same customer-first principles and practices to the Live Casino experience.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy the convenience of playing poker, casino and Live Casino games in the same place, with the same protection of player funds, the same fast payment processing and the same trust that they have come to expect from PokerStars.”</p>
<p>Along with the news of expanding its live dealer reach, PokerStars also announced a new casino game called Immersive Lite Roulette (ILR). Originally created by Evolution, ILR utilizes strategically placed HD cameras around the wheel to give players a revolutionary new perspective.</p>
<p>A Big Deal</p>
<p>Live dealer games have become increasingly popular over the last few years. Amaya first entered the market last October on the Full Tilt casino platform. While real dealer requires higher bets due to higher operating costs, players prefer to interact with human beings when seated at the felt, even players who primarily gamble online.</p>
<p>Those new to Internet gambling are often a bit skeptical when it comes to wagering money. Seeing a person at the table that they can freely interact with should help settle any doubt regarding authentic card and wheel outcomes. In addition, many novice players rely on a dealer in land-based casinos for advice, especially in a game like blackjack. Now they can have that same brick-and-mortar gambling experience right on their computer.</p>
<p>Of course, that isn’t to say live dealer games are for everyone. The shuffling of cards, spinning of the wheel, and overall slower pace of a live dealer game is frustrating for some iGamers. A large percentage of Internet gamblers also play for lower amounts than you would typically find at a physical casino.</p>
<p>However, the portion of Internet gamblers that prefer live dealer play is substantial enough to support the higher operating costs. Rational’s test run on Full Tilt, subsequent entrance on the premiere network in Spain, and current expansion throughout the rest of Europe and .com domain, signals that live casino games are here to stay.</p>
<p>State-of-the-Art Studio</p>
<p>The PokerStars live dealer studio is headquartered at Evolution Gaming’s Riga casino, which is home to more tables than any other land-based operator in Europe. PokerStars has created its own custom-designed floor in the large production space, providing customers with the look and feel they’ve grown accustomed to online, although now in a real virtual environment.</p>
<p>To access the room, players need to download the desktop PokerStars 7 client. Mobile device product support is expected to be included in the coming months.</p>
