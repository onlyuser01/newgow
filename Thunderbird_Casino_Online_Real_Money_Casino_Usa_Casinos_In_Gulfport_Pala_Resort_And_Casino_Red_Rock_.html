<p>DAZN Group is in the midst of rapid changes, with the company just launching its sports betting project in the United Kingdom earlier this week. As DAZN seeks to bank on the surging appetite for sports betting, the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Shay Segev, will be attending the SBC Summit Barcelona next month and share his observations and experience with the vertical.</p>
<p>Segev, who is a long-time gambling veteran, was originally at Entain before moving to DAZN Group abruptly after taking the reins last year. Now, the 6,000+ delegates attending will have the opportunity to hear him speak at the global sports betting and iGaming industry gathering at the Fira de Barcelona Montjuic.</p>
<p>Segev himself appears excited about this opportunity. Cited by SBC News the executive said that media and sports convergence is what the future of the industry is going to look like. As CEO of DAZN, Segev focuses on delivering a great and immersive experience and product that sports fans can relate to.</p>
<p>"I am looking forward to sharing my ideas on how the different worlds of media, entertainment, and sports correlate and the business potential of this convergence with the SBC Summit Barcelona audience," Segev said.</p>
<p>DAZN Group has not shied away from breaking ground in the sports betting space themselves. The establishment of DAZN Bet and tapping former BoylesportsCEO Mark Kemp to lead it were tell-tale signs that the streaming giant was preparing to make its presence in the segment felt.</p>
<p>DAZN has been able to rapidly expand its presence in the sports streaming space with more than 700 live and on-demand sports. The company holds the rights to prominent sporting competitions, such as the La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy, and the National Football League. Originally, DAZN focused on boxing and MMA content, but it has moved past that, to expand rapidly across other sports as well.</p>
<p>Segev’s attendance at SBC Summit Barcelona will focus on a keynote speech and his participation in a panel discussion that will further discuss the emerging trend in sports betting which sees entertainment, media, and sports betting assets merge together.</p>
<p>This has already been happening with companies such as FuboTV and even Disney’s ESPN. DAZN Group is no different in excepting to bank on this trend and put its own know-how and expertise to the fore to reap the rewards and deliver new products that sports fans desire. SBC CEO &amp; Founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity to have Segev attend SBC Summit Barcelona:</p>
<p>DAZN is one of the most talked about and potentially most disruptive new market entrants for years. I look forward to having Shay speak at our flagship event.</p>
<p>Sojmark assured that Segev is the perfect person to talk to when it comes to how these intertwined worlds will come together and elevate the sports betting industry and entertainment for all.</p>
