    <h1>River Rock Casino Hotel Richmond Canada Poker Star Casino Mystake Casino Who Owns Hard Rock Casino C</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming, a prominent iGaming aggregator and supplier of content, has struck a new partnership with Quantum Gaming, a white label, and turnkey platform provider. As a result, Relax Gaming will deploy its range of titles and products with Quantum Gaming white label casinos and bring forth some of the most prominent iGaming and player-favorite titles, including Snake Arena, Money Train 2, Temple Tumble, and others.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s Content to Be Available to Quantum Partners</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has an excellent catalog of games that will fit right in with the needs of white-label casinos and sportsbook solutions. Quantum Gaming has a reputation for building some of the best white-label casino and sportsbook solutions, which are all based on advanced AI technology along with customizable middleware and UI.</p>
<p>Quantum Gaming customers will be able to access both the aggregated offer through the Powered By Relax and Silver Bullet partnership programs and Relax Gaming’s in-house titles developed with the idea of elevating the iGaming experience.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has recently added Elysium Studios as its latest partner studio and Relax itself released Dead Riders Trail and TNT Tumble Dream Drop. Commenting on this new partnership, Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard said:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to offer our portfolio of casino titles to Quantum Gaming’s white-label casinos. It’s a testament to the hard work of our talented team that platform providers such as Quantum are boosting their offering with our first-class line-up of games. Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Great Opportunity and Bargaining Chip</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by Quantum Gaming CEO Oliver de Bono who was thrilled with the opportunity to add more prominent titles from one of the most accomplished developers and aggregators. There are a few products that can come close to matching what Relax offers partners, de Bono said.</p>
<p>“We’re truly excited to be working with them and look forward to forming a very special partnership going forward,” he concluded. Relax Gaming continues to stand out as one of the most prominent aggregators and suppliers of games. The company runs a couple of prominent partnership programs that allow third-party developers to discover global audiences and promote their products with established operators.</p>
<p>Quantum Gaming partnering with Relax would give the white label solutions supplier a stronger bargaining chip when negotiating existing and future partnerships, having Relax Gaming’s extensive library backing.</p>
