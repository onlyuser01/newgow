<p>Relax Gaming, a leading iGaming developer and aggregator of content, has teamed up with fellow industry specialist GAN to offer action-packed content by Silverback Gaming to bigger audiences around the world. Silverback Gaming, which is now the property of GAN, will be able to reach new jurisdictions and more brands in existing ones thanks to the push towards consolidations and strategic collaborations in the industry.</p>
<p>Silverback Gaming Given a Fresh Push</p>
<p>GAN secured the purchase of the studio at the turn of the year and has ambitious plans for the company. Silverback has been mostly running autonomously following the acquisition and now expects to create as many as 50 online slots games that are marked by highly-immersive gaming environments and a mobile-first approach within the next three years.</p>
<p>That will complement the existing portfolio of titles, to name mystery Stacks and Aztec Luck. Silverback has been rapidly expanding across the iGaming industry by offering hard-hitting and optimized content that has become synonymous with the studio itself.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming will bolster the studio’s reach by offering access to new markets in various corners of the world. This reach will be further amplified by the Silver Bullet program used by Relax for its content suppliers. The tie-up has been well-received by Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon, who said:</p>
<p>“Relax Gaming is delighted to continue its partnership with both Silverback and now GAN as part of its continued drive to work with innovative and promising studios under our Silver Bullet program.” Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon</p>
<p>Silverback Gaming Excited at the Opportunity</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Silverback Gaming founder and CEO Raph Di Guisto commented on the opportunity and said that GAN’s B2B expertise has been defining in scaling up the studio’s offer.</p>
<p>Di Guisto hinted that the United States is a focus as well, and the company will seek to scale up its efforts there, as the overall scope of distribution worldwide has improved now that Relax Gaming is onboard:</p>
<p>“In addition, marrying our resources and teams of engineers will expedite our ability to bring new and exciting games to players over the coming years. We are very pleased to continue our relationship with Relax Gaming to ensure the best scope of distribution for our existing and upcoming content.” Silverback Gaming founder and CEO Raph Di Guisto</p>
<p>Relax Gaming now offers over 3,000 online casino games that are aggregated across its two cutting-edge platforms, to name Silver Bullet and Powered By Relax.</p>
