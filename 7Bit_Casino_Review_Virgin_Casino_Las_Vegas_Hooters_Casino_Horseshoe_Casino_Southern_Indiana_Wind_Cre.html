<p>QTech Games has teamed up with casino games developer Spearhead Studios to add more valuable products to its aggregation platform and help Spearhead reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Spearhead Studios Gains Access to Markets in Europe, Asia and LatAm</p>
<p>Spearhead Studios has entered into an alliance with QTech Games, the preeminent distributor of iGaming products across Asia, expanding its potential audiences and delivering high-tier gaming products to consumers in new markets.</p>
<p>As part of the tie-up, QTech Games partners will be able to tap into Spearhead’s full A-grade portfolio, which features 25 slots and table games, including player-favorite choices such as Wilds of Wall Street and Book of Souls.</p>
<p>The addition of highly-recognizable iGaming products will allow QTech Games to cement its position and give its content aggregation platform a proper boost to explore new market opportunities.</p>
<p>Presently, QTech Games already has titles by Ezugi and Yggdrasil and plans to add other up-and-coming and established studios. For its part, Spearhead stands to benefit from a quick distribution of its products in multiple exciting markets with games that are ready to play and do not need additional tinkering from the developer to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Bringing Expertise to Gain Distinction</p>
<p>QTech’s focus lies on both developed markets such as Eastern Europe, and growing and high-added value markets as Latin America and Asia. Commenting on the partnership, QTech Games CCO Ulf Norder outlined the company’s strategy.</p>
<p>QTech, Norder said, was committed to introducing products that lead to new revenue streams for partners. The deal with Spearhead Studios extends a wide-ranging pipeline for the year, he added.</p>
<p>Given the competitiveness of the market today, Norder expects only the best products and studios to help any company separate itself from the crowd and Spearhead is one such company.</p>
<p>Spearhead Studios Managing Director Mathias Larsson added that its new partnership with QTech will allow Spearhead to create and distribute “local games to local markets.” Spearhead will have the opportunity to boost its distribution across emerging territories and connect with new audiences, expanding the partnership in the months to come.</p>
<p>“In an era of customization, QTech Games is truly embracing its brand promise of tailoring top-class content for diverse audiences. It keeps them at the cutting edge of relevance for all kinds of players across emerging markets,” Larson concluded.</p>
