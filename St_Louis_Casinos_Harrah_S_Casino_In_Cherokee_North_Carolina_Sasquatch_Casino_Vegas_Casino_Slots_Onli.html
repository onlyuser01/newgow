    <h1>St Louis Casinos Harrah S Casino In Cherokee North Carolina Sasquatch Casino Vegas Casino Slots Onli</h1>

<p>Hello sammy1,</p>
<p>Congratulations to you. What you described is quite normal, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Frankly, if you win big you usually trigger a further check. It's normal. If you win a national lottery you are also not paid immediately. So, the casino is probably checking your gaming history at the moment. They also need to make sure that there was no technical glitch or bug in the game because in accordance with the Terms and Conditions in such a case casino is not obliged to pay out the winnings. Due to this, even the game provider can be asked for some technical details associated with your gameplay. Just check the rules yourself to be sure about it. I'd be very surprised if this statement is missing.</p>
<p>What is not normal is the way how the casino share information with you.</p>
<p>I do not understand why they just can't say: Hey, congratulations! Allow us a few weeks to check your gaming history with the game provider we must stick with our Terms and Conditions as well. We will inform you when any development occurs." - or something similar instead of: "Your account has been suspended</p>
<p>because we have detected suspicious activities."</p>
<p>This is not a good approach. üôÅ</p>
