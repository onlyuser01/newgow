<p>Dear Amin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked T&amp;Cs (https://www.wildz.com/en/info/terms-and-conditions/), and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"5.6 - You must enter all mandatory information requested in the registration form in particular, your age, your identity, your address and contact details, including a valid email address, valid mobile phone number and your place of residence and it is your sole responsibility to ensure that the information you provide to us is true, complete and correct. Note that you must be 18 years of age or older, or such higher minimum legal age as stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you and, under the laws applicable to you, you are allowed to participate in the Games offered on the Website.</p>
<p>5.7 - You are hereby notified that we carry out verification procedures and that your Account may be blocked for access or closed if we suspect that you have supplied us with false or misleading information."</p>
<p>I carefully reviewed your case and, unfortunately, there is nothing I can do for you in this case. You are responsible to always provide correct and full information. The casino cannot risk paying out winnings to a wrong person and you were supposed to inform the casino about this fact immediately before you started playing.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if there is anything else, we could do for you, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint. Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
