    <h1>Fallsview Casino Resort Niagara Falls L Auberge Lake Charles Casino Newyorknewyorklasvegas Casino Ca</h1>

<p>All private data has been censored so please make this public</p>
<p>I can't confirm this since Stake has suspended me from all my conversations, so I can't look through them, I have collected a compilation of some of the screenshots I got.</p>
<p>But I believe I showed clear signs of gambling addiction and I took contact to GamCare and showed them my messages with Stake and they also told me that Stake was wrong not excluding me.</p>
<p>And as Stake stated in this email, I didn't have to tell them I had a gambling addiction, the slightest signs of gambling addiction would be enough to get my account closed.</p>
<p>I also found an email where I mentioned to Stake that my cool-down was completed and I wanted a permanently exclusion but they only gave me a new cool-down periode and I requested the staff to exclude me permanently once the cool-down has been completed as well.</p>
<p>"The important factor, according to our policies, is the situation when the casino was clearly aware of your addiction."</p>
<p>Is this really the right approach? - Wouldn't this just allow the casino to always say they wasn't aware?</p>
<p>And to elaborate Stake's response</p>
<p>a)</p>
<p>I didn't exclude myself because my VIP host offered me a bonus that I could only claim if I didn't excluded myself - please note that I did NOT ask for a bonus but was offered it out of the blue.</p>
<p>And secondly, I asked to get my account deleted and the VIP host referred me to the self-exclusion which is not what I asked for.</p>
<p>"Regulations for companies storing data from european citizens "</p>
<p>New regulations, written by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party , came out in spring 2016 and information on this group, including regulatory text, can be found here .</p>
<p>On their site, the page " Protecting your data: your rights " states that users can ask several things of "persons or entities which collect your personal data" including:</p>
<p>So I have the right to ask for the deletion of my account, even though Stake might keep my data by law.</p>
<p>It's also important to notice that I did not request compensation from 31st marts 2021 but from the 27st may 2022.</p>
<p>b &amp; c)</p>
<p>As Staked stated "After the 1 month self-exclusion, the player came back to Stake.com".</p>
<p>This confirms that Stake was aware of my problem, and by definition I clearly stated I have a gambling addiction according to their term of service. (Please see above responses)</p>
<p>Also if we use Stake's Logic, then we could say I never mentioned I had a gambling addiction the 23rd of September. I mentioned that I fell into my addiction, this could be smoking, alcoholism or drugs - So they instantly banning me for just saying addiction without referring to gambling must have indicated they knew I was addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>Why would Stake now say : "It is our understanding that Stake cannot be liable for the player's" when their</p>
<p>Self-Exclusion Policy clearly stated:"We are committed to sharing responsibility, with Governments and communities and individuals, for helping customers control their gambling, and helping problem gamblers to identify their problem and seek assistance."</p>
<p>Staked haven't answered any above question in my previous responses so here they are again:</p>
<p>e1) : Did I make it clear that I wanted my account excluded permanently?</p>
<p>e2) : Did I make it clear that I wanted my account deleted/closed?</p>
<p>e3) : Why was the self-exclusion button disabled on the website for 8 days?</p>
<p>e4) : Stake live chat told me they wasn't authorised to exclude players - So how could Live chat exclude me 23rd of September?</p>
<p>If they are permitted to exclude gambling addicts then they should have told me that. Telling me that they aren't authorised was clearly a lie they told me to avoid identifying my addiction.</p>
<p>e5) : Stake told me they by law and regulations are permitted to close accounts on slightest signs of gambling addiction - What do they indicate as the slightest sign of gambling addiction?</p>
<p>Stake has acces to my sessions, deposits, and multiple self-exclusion requests, not to mention I clearly told them I have lost control over the money spent gambling and I would be back after a 24 hour cool-down so I needed to be excluded permanently instantly.</p>
<p>Please see the article in the respond above that explains 95% of people that want to self-exclude have problem gambling / gambling addiction.</p>
<p>According to stakes terms they are trained in identifying gambling addiction so Stake must have known about my problematic gambling behavior one way or the other. They observed me deposit and gamble high amounts within a few days.</p>
<p>Even my VIP Host mentioned I have had some tough months, I also told he that I lost $5k trying to wager for a bonus of $3.2k. Another clear sign of problem gambling.</p>
