    <h1>Casino Myrtle Beach Larchwood Casino Casinos With Hotels Jakes Casino Funzpoints Casino Real Money B</h1>

<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>I do not recommend bitstarz one bit.</p>
<p>You will have no problem depositing but when it comes to withdrawing the fun stops.</p>
<p>So I had a win of $408.</p>
<p>Went to withdraw it and saw that it was cancelled even though it was crypto, with the casino asking for a verification document of myself.</p>
<p>I uploaded a picture of my passport got because the bottom to corners weren't completely visible I had to upload another one which I did.</p>
<p>I checked my emails and saw that it was cancelled and they then asked for another one containing all 4 corners of passport, which I did.</p>
<p>Yet again that was not approved, I think I asked you upload a selfie holding my passport which I did and that was not approved.</p>
<p>Next I got asked to take a selfie with passport in one hand and a note in the other hand with the date and my name which I did, not approved again.</p>
<p>Next they wanted a clearer picture of my passport with both pages clearly visible, which I did and they rejected it again.</p>
<p>With no further comment they then proceeded to close my account and confiscate my winnings saying it violated their terms etc.</p>
<p>Which is absolute crap because I sent genuine documents and did everything they ask for without losing my cool.</p>
<p>From what I've read around online its happening a fair bit, so I'm not sure whether they're having financial problems or they just do this as a joke.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention aswell as the passport images I also sent in several government documents with my name and address on them, which alone would have been more than enough to verify me, as well as a bank statement.</p>
<p>On top of that, a letter signed by a justice of the piece as evidence the documents are real.</p>
<p>So there was ample evidence of my verification.</p>
<p>Do not play here</p>
