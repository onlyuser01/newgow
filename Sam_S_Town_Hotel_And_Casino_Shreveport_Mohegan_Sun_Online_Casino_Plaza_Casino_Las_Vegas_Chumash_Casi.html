    <h1>Sam S Town Hotel And Casino Shreveport Mohegan Sun Online Casino Plaza Casino Las Vegas Chumash Casi</h1>

<p>Hi There!</p>
<p>I follow a respectable streamer by the name of Aussieslots whom I trust! So I used the casino he recommended. I started playing, not issues, until I wanted to with draw, I tried to withdraw and a it failed, I asked why and the casino said its because of my liscence having an expired date on it, how ever in Australia, the liscemce is still valid because it was my learners liscence that was expired on the card but the card still showed my current driver's liscence and expiry was in 2025.</p>
<p>One of thier support staff said I can upload my passport aswell then they can look at that at ID. I then uploaded my passport to the account and asked about it being assessed and they ignored me constantly when I asked about the passport. I have most of the emails.</p>
<p>The casino said they won't accept the card so I messaged aussie slots to help, he contacted them and explained to them that that's how the licence is here unless you get it renewed. They said ok fine get it renewed and give it to them. I explained to both aussieslots and the casino that it would take a few weeks for the new Card to arrive, they said that's fines "the money will be safe". A few days later I was declined access to my account, I messaged aussie slots and he said he will see what he can do. I have now been waiting for the casino to sort it out with him for over 2 months now and I dont know if much has been fixed, I feel like im being dodged and left behind.</p>
