    <h1>Soboba Casino Hotel Terribles Casino Casinos In Laughlin Rio All Suite Hotel Casino Reviews Casinos</h1>

<p>It’s time for the second race of Round of 8 of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series. The race in question is the 2023 4EVER 400, which will take place at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Florida, on Sunday, October 22</p>
<p>The 2023 Homestead-Miami race is sponsored by Mobile 1, who decided to call the event the 2023 4EVER 400. The reason behind this is to honor Kevin Harvick (and his 4EVER campaign) who’s going to retire from NASCAR after the end of the 2023 season.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old driver hasn’t won a single race this year, but he did come very close on a couple of occasions. Still, bookies do not believe he’s going to come on top on October 22. His 2023 4EVER odds are +3500 right now.</p>
<p>Instead, the No. 1 favorite is Kyle Larson with 4EVER 400 odds of +275, followed by Tyler Reddick (500) and Martin Truex Jr. (+550).</p>

<p>Racing for a Spot in the Championship 4</p>
<p>Kyle Larson has moved to the top spot of the 2023 NASCAR Drivers’ Standings after winning last week’s race in Vegas. By doing it, he also became the only driver who’s booked a spot in the Championship Race.</p>
<p>There are three more tickets up for grabs, which is why the remaining 7 Playoff drivers will have to go all-in on Sunday in the 2023 4EVER 400 race. This goes especially for Ryan Blaney who won zero points last weekend in Vegas. He did finish sixth but was disqualified after it was revealed that the left-front shock on his Ford Mustang did not meet the specified length.</p>
<p>The result is that he now has to go for a win in (at least) one of the two remaining races of Round of 8 in order to secure a place in the Championship 4.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that he doesn’t seem to be a huge fan of the Homestead-Miami race. He’s never won it, and the last time he competed in the race formerly known as Dixie Vodka 400, Blaney finished in the No. 12 place.</p>
<p>2023 4EVER 400 Prediction</p>
<p>Blaney is someone without great memories from Homestead-Miami, but there’s one Playoff driver who seems to love this race. It’s the three-time winner Denny Hamlin.</p>
<p>Not only does he love racing here, but he also needs to do well in the 2023 1Mobile 400 to secure a place in the Championship 4. He’s currently fourth in the standings with 4,071 points, which is the same as Martin Truex Jr., and three more than Christopher Bell.</p>
<p>2023 4EVER Pick: Denny Hamlin to win</p>
