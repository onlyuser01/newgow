    <h1>Casino In Canada Montreal Turtle Creek Casino Michigan Hoosier Park Racing Casino Casino Machines Fo</h1>

<p>Hi, I have been accused of breached terms and conditions at the aspire global casinos. That include hopa.com, mrplay.com, betiton.com, karamba.com and betregal,</p>
<p>.com. Their email, which I recevied midday 06.12.2021 said this:</p>
<p>"Mr/Ms ****,</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your account has come to our attention due to discrepancies identified during our regular security checks and breaching several T&amp;C points including the below:</p>
<p>19.19.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to void any or all bets made by any person or group of persons acting in an attempt to defraud us.</p>
<p>1.2.</p>
<p>Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same (or very similar) selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate or individuals, we reserve the right to make bets void and suspend relevant accounts. This rule applies to both settled and unsettled bets.</p>
<p>21.3.</p>
<p>If you have played in a professional capacity, or in tandem with other customer(s) as part of a club, group, etc., or placed bets or wagers in a coordinated manner with other customer(s) involving the same (or materially the same) selections; in this instance we further reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restrict the total maximum pay out for the combined total of any such bets, to the equivalent of the Maximum Winnings Per Month limit permitted for a single Customer (as outlined at section 20 above). Aspire Global International LTD is for sole use on an individual basis and for personal entertainment only.</p>
<p>As a result of the investigation conducted into this matter, we have taken the following action on Hopa account;</p>
<p>• Initial deposit made in the account has been refunded</p>
<p>• All pending Cashout requests have been voided</p>
<p>• The account with [brand.name] permanently suspended</p>
<p>We must further advise you that the business relationship between us has ended, please refrain from opening any new accounts with us this also means using amended details or alias. Any new accounts located will also have the above action taken</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Team Hopa"</p>
<p>I received these emails last week with horror. I can not recongnise myself dong these things they accuse me of. I have simply bet on the sports teams I think would win, by myself, no one else. The most critical thing for me is that they are saying they will cancel all my winnings. This is life changing money and for hopa.com ad their sister casinos just to cancel my balance is not fair. I have used half a year to bet my self up to these levels of money. Now all gone and I am left in the dark not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>So I have to repeat. I did not bet with any other person or group. I played for myself. No one else. I played with high stakes, but am not a "proffesional". If hopa or any other of their casinos demeed my betting as "unfair" they could simply just say so, but for them to take my money is extremly unfair.</p>
<p>And for the last term they clamied I breached, how am I suppose to know that there is a monthly winning limit? Every time I was in support chat they congratulated me on my big winnings.</p>
<p>It all seems very unfair and unproffesional coming from a MGA licensed casino. I hope casino.guru can help me reveiw these claims from aspire, which I rejected at the strongest. Have a good day. If casino.guru or aspire global for that matter, need any more proof, please conatct me. Have a good day.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
