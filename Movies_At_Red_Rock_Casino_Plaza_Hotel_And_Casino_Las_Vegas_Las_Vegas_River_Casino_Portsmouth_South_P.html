<p>Manchester City continue their campaign to retain the Premier League title with a trip to North London. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is where the Cityzens will take on the Spurs on Sunday, February 5</p>
<p>Manchester City still believe that theyâ€™re going to get back to the No. 1 position in the Premier League before the end of the season. That position is currently occupied by Arsenal, but weâ€™re practically at the midway point of the 2022-23 season â€“ 20 rounds have passed and there are 18 more to go.</p>
<p>The trouble for City is that their schedule in the next couple of weeks looks very ugly, starting with Sundayâ€™s game against Tottenham. On the bright side for Pep Guardiolaâ€™s men, theyâ€™ve been playing superb soccer lately. Unfortunately for them, so have the boys from Tottenham.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Manchester City Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Tottenham +333 Draw +300 Manchester City -137</p>
<p>Goals Over/Under Odds Over 2.5 Goals -161 Under 2.5 Goals +129</p>

<p>Antonio Conte Wonâ€™t be There on Sunday to Lead the Spurs</p>
<p>The Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte is currently in hospital, where heâ€™s recovering from gallbladder surgery. Heâ€™s okay, but he wonâ€™t be able to return to his managerial duties for at least a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Antonio Conte recently became unwell with severe abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Following a diagnosis of cholecystitis, he will be undergoing surgery to remove his gallbladder today and will return following a period of recuperation.</p>
<p>Everyone at the Club wishes him well ðŸ’™ pic.twitter.com/h91LfV8lD9 â€” Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) February 1, 2023</p>
<p>What this means is that on Sunday, Conteâ€™s assistant Cristian Stellini will take over the role of the manager. This wonâ€™t be the first time Stellini is in charge of Tottenham. He lead the team in November when the Spurs played a UEFA Champions League game against Olympique Marseille. Conte was away due to a suspension following a red card in the previous round of the competition.</p>
<p>Stellini did well in that game, leading his team to a 2-1 win on the road. This time, his team is playing at home, are they going to do even better?</p>
<p>Manchester City Ready for a Title Push</p>
<p>Pep Guardiolaâ€™s team looks really good at the moment. Theyâ€™re 3-0 in their last three games in all competitions, one of which was the first Spurs game of the EPL season. They defeated Conteâ€™s men 4-2 at home. Then, they went on to destroy Wolves 4-0 on the road, before taking on Arsenal in the FA Cup.</p>
<p>It was a close match, but the Cityzens ended up knocking out the Gunners thanks to a 1-0 win at Etihad. They werenâ€™t too impressive in that game if weâ€™re being honest. Still, they did get the job done, which is what really matters at the end of the day.</p>
<p>We do, however, expect to see more from them on Sunday. After all, the Premier League is their No. 1 priority.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>Conte fell ill abruptly a few days ago and hasnâ€™t been able to help out with team duties since. What this means is that â€“ unlike the Marseille game â€“ Stellini is completely on his own this time. And even if that wasnâ€™t the case, he and the Spurs would still have huge problems against such a strong opponent as Manchester City.</p>
<p>The visitors are determined to keep the EPL title in their possession, which is why theyâ€™re taking this game very seriously. They need all three points and theyâ€™re going to grab them on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
