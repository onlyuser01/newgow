<p>Malta-based games and virtual sports provider Leap Gaming was given the green light to operate on the British market. The British Gambling Commission has issued the new supplier license, following a series of licenses obtained for the regulated gaming markets in Sweden on March 10 and Romania a week later.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming Joins One of the Biggest Gaming Markets on the Planet</p>
<p>The new license is extremely important for the supplier as it will allow it to offer its premier content to licensed casino operators that are currently active in the regulated market in the UK. The company’s chief executive officer Yariv Lissauer expressed his delight regarding the new supply license. He also added that Leap Gaming is honored to enter the “very important territory”, calling the UK gaming market “one of the prime gaming markets in the world.” Lissauer also referred to the UK as a “key benchmark” as well as a trendsetter for the majority of gambling jurisdictions at a worldwide level, while playing the role of an innovation hub.</p>
<p>Since the UK market is also deeply embedded in the footprint of the majority of Leap Gaming’s partners, the company is eager to provide its content there and start expanding its business. The freshly secured license is, therefore, a much-anticipated one, representing a milestone for the provider.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming Is Licensed in Numerous European Countries</p>
<p>The company also holds other supplier licenses on the European continent, in countries like Greece, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Romania. South Africa is another location where Leap Gaming’s products are already available to fans of table games, online slots, and virtual sports. The Swedish license was provided by the country’s Gambling Authority, enabling the provider to offer its products within the country’s borders.</p>
<p>The Romanian license was issued by the Romanian National Gambling Office and it allows the provider to offer its casino software and virtual sports products to business-to-consumer and business-to-business operators.</p>
<p>In November 2021, the Hellenic Gaming Commission welcomed Leap Gaming to its gaming market. The Netherlands Gaming Authority also granted the gaming supplier a license, allowing it to enter its market for licensed operators.</p>
<p>Leap Gaming offers top-tier virtual games for mobile, online, and retail markets and has important partnerships with a number of global gaming operators. Greyhounds Streak, Horses Streak, Football Penalty Duel, and NASCAR Streak are just a few of the freshets games released by the supplier.</p>
