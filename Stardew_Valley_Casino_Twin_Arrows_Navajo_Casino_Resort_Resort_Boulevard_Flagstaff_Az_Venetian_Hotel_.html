<p>Release the Kraken 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Release the Kraken 2 is themed around an underwater world inhabited by strange and adorable creatures.</p>
<p>Players will plunge into the salty depths of the ocean where they’ll meet sharks, puffer fish, and, of course, the Kraken. In this magical realm, players will need to keep their wits about them if they ever want to reach the surface again.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The haunting soundtrack is filled with dramatic notes and the gentle sounds of water bubbling. This adds to the immersive underwater atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will spot sassy eels, grinning bioluminescent fish, and the titular Kraken with his many arms and a fierce gaze. Each character is animated in a colorful cartoon style, making for a lighthearted aesthetic.</p>
<p>Colorful letters and a gold-gilded Kraken also make an appearance among the symbols, ensuring that the reels are eye-catching.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a beautiful underwater scene is visible, with fish darting by and bubbles slowly floating upwards. Players will feel like explorers in the alien world of the deep ocean. A mermaid would have been an intriguing addition to the fantasy of Release the Kraken 2.</p>
<p>Together, the music and graphics create a cheerful realm of fish and monsters.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>The Wild Respin feature is triggered when players land at least 4 Wild symbols. Then, these Wild symbols jump around the reels as the reels respin. If players land additional Wilds, players are awarded an additional respin.</p>
<p>The Shifting Stacked Wilds feature occurs when the Shifting Stacked Wild symbol appears on the reels. This stacked symbol always nudges to become fully visible, with the associated multiplier increasing by each nudge.</p>
<p>The Guaranteed Win feature occurs randomly on any spin that lacks a winning combination. The Kraken will appear on the reels and ensure a win takes place.</p>
<p>If players land 3 Bonus symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. Prior to the beginning of the Free Spins feature, players may choose to play a bonus game to win a combination of free spins and a particular multiplier. If a higher number of Bonus symbols triggered the feature, then a higher number of free spins as well as higher multipliers will be possible.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, Wild symbols remain on the reels, moving to different positions for each spin.</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols award the lowest combination of Free spins amount and Multiplier for the bonus game</p>
