<p>MaxBet has secured access to games such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Dork Unit and Hand of Anubis</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading supplier of online casino content, has announced a new partnership deal with MaxBet Romania. Under the agreement, the former company will inject content into the operator’s platform.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, a suite of Hacksaw Gaming content will become available to MaxBet Romania and its players. This will notably include hit slot titles, such as Wanted Dead or a Wild, Dork Unit and Hand of Anubis, among others.</p>
<p>As a result, the supplier will be able to expand its Romanian footprint and engage more local players with its games. The move is in line with the company’s overall growth strategy which has seen it expand in more than 20 regulated markets thanks to deals with hundreds of casino brands. The company has been enjoying steady growth ever since launching its first Scratchcard title in 2019.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Is Happy to Expand in Romania</p>
<p>Gabrielle Star, Hacksaw Gaming’s chief commercial officer, commented on the new deal, dubbing it “another leap forward.” According to Star, the partnership with MaxBet will bolster the company’s standing in Romania, as Hacksaw continues to seek expansion in regulated markets.</p>
<p>Star concluded that Hacksaw Gaming is enjoying a great deal of attention in Romania and added that the company is excited to launch its products with a major local company.</p>
<p>Romanian players have already demonstrated a thirst for our extensive portfolio of games, and we’re delighted to reach an even broader audience through this deal with a leading player in MaxBet. Gabrielle Star, CCO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alexandru Ghiurcau, marketing manager at MaxBet Romania, welcomed Hacksaw Gaming’s content to his company’s portfolio. He said that the new games will provide extra enjoyment to MaxBet’s customers.</p>
<p>With the goal of offering MaxBet.ro players an experience at another level, the Hacksaw slots will provide a unique experience 24/7. And there is plenty more to follow in this partnership. Alexandru Ghiurcau, marketing manager, MaxBet Romania</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming continues to solidify its position as a leading full-service iGaming company and was designated as Slot Supplier Rising Star at the EGR B2B Awards. This accolade came weeks after the company secured the 2023 CasinoBeats Outperforming Game Studio of the Year – Medium award sponsored by SlotCatalog.</p>
<p>Last month, the provider formed an alliance with BetMGM Ontario, further expanding its global reach. This came a month after the supplier secured a B2B license from the Swedish gambling regulator.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company also expanded in Italy through a partnership deal with Sisal.</p>
