<p>The provider of advanced platform and sportsbook solutions has launched in Maryland with a local brand</p>
<p>Moving forward, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) will operate in Maryland, on top of its growing number of jurisdictions in the United States where it is licensed and already has a presence in.</p>
<p>GiG Gives Crab Sports a Strong Start in Maryland</p>
<p>This is possible through a team-up with Crab Sports, which allows the sportsbook to benefit from GiG’s advanced and tailored solutions to offer even more rewarding experiences to sports bettors. GiG has an established presence in the regulated gambling market in the United States and has been actively building up its footprint through the signage of additional brands.</p>
<p>Crab Sports is one of the latest entries into the regulated Maryland betting market which went underway in Q4 2022. Ever since, the state has generated a hefty bit of gross gaming revenue, with $328 million reported by local regulators through May this year.</p>
<p>GiG’s proprietary platform is going to give Crab Sports a strong start in the contested jurisdiction and allow it to move forward with the player acquisition, retention, and penetrating the market despite arriving later than other brands. The move was naturally welcomed by the company’s CCO, Marcel Elfersy:</p>
<p>It’s great to be launching with a localized brand like Crab Sports, sharing their vision that Maryland, and indeed the wider US market, can benefit from the opportunities of a strong partnership between operator and provider, building a unique and personalized customer experience that is tailored for local interests. GiG CCO Marcel Elfersy</p>
<p>Crab Sports Hopeful of GiG Alliance to Boost Maryland Presence</p>
<p>Elfersy spoke highly of the company’s ability to differentiate the product offering for its clients and thus give them a strong advantage over existing competitors even in saturated markets. Crab Sports’ Derek Baker was similarly excited to be making this first step in Maryland alongside GiG’s team.</p>
<p>The entry into the market has already been celebrated as a tremendous achievement and Baker remained hopeful that the tie-up with GiG would allow his company to quickly shape up as a competitive entrant in Maryland.</p>
<p>GiG has also been helping brands all over the world find purchases in regulated and lucrative markets, albeit competitive ones. The company teamed up with Rizk Casino in Germany and Bplay in Mendoza, Argentina.</p>
