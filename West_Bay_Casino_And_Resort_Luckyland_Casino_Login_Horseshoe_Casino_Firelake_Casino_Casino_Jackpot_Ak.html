<p>If carried out, this strike would become the most extensive labor action in the history of the US hospitality industry</p>
<p>In a bold move that could disrupt the bustling streets of Las Vegas and coincide with the city’s inaugural Formula 1 races, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 have set a strike deadline for Friday, November 10, 2023, at 5:00 am PT.</p>
<p>Historic Hospitality Worker Strike Threatens Las Vegas Casinos</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of hotel workers, totaling 35,000, are prepared to walk off the job if agreements are not reached by that date with major casino giants, including MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>The strike, if executed, will mark the largest hospitality worker strike in the history of the United States. The unions, representing a total of 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno, have been negotiating for over seven months to secure better pay, reduced workloads, improved safety measures, and various other provisions for their members.</p>
<p>Ted Pappageorge, the Secretary-Treasurer for the Culinary Union, stated that a month prior, workers had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. He mentioned that negotiations had been ongoing in good faith, but lamented the insufficient progress made by companies in the discussions.</p>
<p>Pappageorge added: “Their current proposal on the table is historic, but it is not enough and workers deserve to have record contracts – especially after these giant corporations are enjoying their record profits.”</p>
<p>Las Vegas Union Prepares for Large-Scale Strike</p>
<p>The Culinary Union, which has not gone on strike in decades, is intensively preparing for the large-scale walkout. They have been amassing supplies and materials to maintain 45 different strike stations with multiple picket lines around casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Workers are being educated on how to sign up for strike pay, and preparations are being made for a 24/7 strike line at every casino, complete with tablets for strike sign-in, picket signs, portable bathrooms, tables, chairs, bullhorns, and other essential items.</p>
<p>Last week, Las Vegas workers, represented by the Culinary Workers Union, staged a peaceful protest to highlight ongoing contract negotiations with major casinos. Approximately 58 protesters were arrested during the demonstration, which aimed to address issues such as pay raises and improved working conditions for the union’s 40,000 members whose contracts have recently expired.</p>
<p>The potential strike would impact 18 casino resorts on the Strip, including iconic properties like Aria, Bellagio, Caesars Palace, and Mandalay Bay. The situation is made even more significant by the fact that it might coincide with the city’s eagerly anticipated Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend, scheduled to commence on November 15. Thousands of spectators are expected to flock to the Strip for the event, raising concerns about potential disruptions.</p>
