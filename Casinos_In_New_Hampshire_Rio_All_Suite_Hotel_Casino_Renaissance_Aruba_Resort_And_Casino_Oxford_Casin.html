    <h1>Casinos In New Hampshire Rio All Suite Hotel Casino Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino Oxford Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today to file a complaint against Stake Casino (Stake.com). Stake is a crypto currency casino which holds an Antillephone Curacao Gaming license (8048/JAZ).</p>
<p>The grounds to my complaint are that Stake's Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) processes are insufficient and in breach of the license requirements and curacao law, specifically the NOIS (Attached.) and regulations specified by the Curacao Gaming Control Board. With the insufficient processes in place I was able to create a new account even though I am self excluded permanently with Stake (Since March 28th 2020) and deposit a large sum of money over a short period of time with no identity verification checks carried out at any stage. In total my deposits less any withdrawals made totalled £4,165.64 GBP. I am seeking a refund of the full amount due to the failure on stake's part to collect the required relevant CDD, KYC and AML information which would have prevented a self excluded patron from creating a further account and depositing this amount of money.</p>
<p>I will summarise my complaint briefly below however will submit a full word document detailing everything with supporting documents.</p>
<p>I would like to summarise my complaint below:</p>
<p>Failure to perform the required KYC, CDD and AML checks. Required by Law and License. I was able to sign up to Stake, deposit in excess of €20,000, withdraw in excess of €15,000 and wager over €350,000 in a three month period without any identity verification checks being carried out. I have made stake aware of this in the prior disputes so they are well aware of this being an issue for self excluded patrons not being identified and they are well aware of what needs to be done to comply with these requirements. Complete disregard for the protection of vulnerable customers and lack of procedures for responsible gambling. Given I have been in this position with Stake 3 times prior to this dispute. It is clear that Stake are completely ignoring their responsibilities with regards to vulnerable customers, self exclusions and KYC, AML and CDD policies. I have made it clear with every correspondence I have made with Stake that this is the issue and this is why I was able to create a new account and nothing has been done to resolve this. Given that the resolutions and answers of how to fix the issues are being handed to them I see this as a failure of the ‘reasonable’ responsibility to protect self excluded patrons and vulnerable customers. And it certainly shows an element of irresponsibility from Stake.</p>
<p>Proposed Resolution:</p>
<p>I am seeking to be put in the same position I was prior to creating this account and by my calculations that would mean a refund of £4,165.64 GBP however I am happy for Stake to check this figure. There is also an additional amount of £1,200 which was deposited after I sent an email to Stake letting them know of the account, I do not have the transaction proof for this however I believe Stake will have. Therefore I have put the value of my complaint as £4,165.64 until the additional £1,200 is confirmed.</p>
<p>Again the full details are in my file submissions, thank you for taking the time to look into my complaint.</p>
