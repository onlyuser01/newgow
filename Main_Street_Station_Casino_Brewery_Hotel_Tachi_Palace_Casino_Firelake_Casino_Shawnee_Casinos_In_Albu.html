<p>Shay Segev, formerly a chief executive of the international sports betting and gambling company Entain has now risen as the chief executive of the British sports media company DAZN Group.</p>
<p>Segev’s Abilities Will Benefit DAZN’s Plans</p>
<p>The move is a part of DAZN’s plans for 2022, which include a restructuring of its leadership in order to pursue further growth and fulfill its product strategies.</p>
<p>In the words of Kevin Mayer, the chairman of DAZN Group, the company has already established itself as a global leader in sports streaming. He thinks that it is time to move forward and grow the business even more. Mayer believes the leadership changes are a means to achieve that. According to Mayer, Shay’s experience will be crucial to the company’s plans:</p>
<p>“Shay’s technology background and outstanding history of delivering a strong performance culture will be hugely beneficial, as Dazn introduces additional interactive fan engagement services such as betting and eCommerce for users to enjoy alongside our core offering of live sports streaming.” DAZN Group chairman Kevin Mayer</p>
<p>Segev Has Years of Experience From Serving as Entain’s CEO</p>
<p>Segev joined DAZN Group not too long ago, in June 2021. In the beginning, he served as a co-CEO of the company. However, he is now set to become the company’s sole chief executive as he has proven his competence to the new company.</p>
<p>Segev is a seasoned veteran with years of experience in gambling and sports media. Before joining DAZN Group, he served as the chief executive of Entain for almost five years. As a part of Entain’s leadership, Segev proved to be highly capable of leading and helped the company scale up its business by strategic acquisitions and the creation of new brands.</p>
<p>As a CEO of Entain, Segev helped the company form the BetMGM brand and complete the key acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral and bwin.party. By the time he left the company to join DAZN, Entain had reached a market cap of $13.6 billion.</p>
<p>DAZN Group is looking forward to seeing Segev replicate this same success in its service. His appointment as a sole CEO comes at an important time as the company is rumored to be in talks for acquiring BT Sport.</p>
<p>DAZN Will Also Acquire a New CFO</p>
<p>Other than promoting Segev as the company’s sole CEO, DAZN Group also appointed a new chief financial officer to its ranks. Darren Waterman, an ex-Amazon worker, will be filling the role. Waterman has years of experience in Amazon Prime Video and will bring valuable knowledge to the sports media company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stuart Epstein, the former CFO, will be changing his role to a senior advisor and a board member.</p>
