<p>The Virtual Gaming Association of Timor-Leste seeks to cement the island as the next iGaming hub</p>
<p>Timor-Leste might be the next global hub for online gaming licensing and professional support services. According to reports, the small island country is keen on tapping into what the sector has to offer.</p>
<p>For reference, Timor-Leste is an island nation mostly situated in the eastern part of Timor Island. Neighboring Australia and Indonesia, the small nation has big plans for its online casino industry.</p>
<p>According to reports The Virtual Gaming Association (VGA) of Timor-Leste, a trade association representing online gaming, seeks to cement the island as the next iGaming hub, similar to Malta.</p>
<p>Speaking of Malta, representatives of the VGA recently met with global gaming operators in Malta and discussed policies that would set up Timor-Leste as the next global iGaming licensing hub. To that end, the Asian island nation would need to implement robust player protection measures and strict technological requirements for operators.</p>
<p>The aim is to establish Timor-Leste as a reliable and business-friendly jurisdiction that attracts operators from all over the world. The predominantly young age of the island’s populace is an important factor for the consideration of Timor-Leste as a gambling hub. The VGA believes that this will allow for the creation of many call and data center jobs.</p>
<p>In the future, the VGA also hopes to usher in the development of luxurious casino resorts.</p>
<p>The MGA Cracked Down on Non-Compliant Sites</p>
<p>Speaking of international iGaming hubs, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) recently cracked down on a number of non-compliant operators. In October, for example, the company canceled the license of Arabmillionaire Limited and issued a notice of license cancelation to AMGO Gaming. The latter company had failed to pay its fees and was provided with 20 days to respond to the regulator, lest it loses its license.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the MGA also canceled the authorization of SFJL Holdings, which also owed fees to the authority.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the MGA denied having any connections with kaiyin.io, saying that any reference to the authority cited by the operator is “false and misleading.” The gambling regulator reminded players to only play with operators they are absolutely certain are legal.</p>
