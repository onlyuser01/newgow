<p>Partnership between the two brands unrolls the red carpet to their online sportsbook brand in New Jersey</p>
<p>Available on Android and iOS, Fox Bet will offer daily coverage with featured hosts and pre-match, and in-play wagering on a variety of sports</p>
<p>Having struck a 25-year commercial agreement, the aim is for Fox Bet to become the national sports betting media portal</p>
<p>Robin Chhabra, CEO of the brand, introduced the online sportsbook portal, saying that “Fox Bet combines decades of expertise in content-rich programing and regulated online gaming to drive a superior, integrated and interactive live viewing experience for our customers found nowhere else in the United States.”</p>
<p>National Sports Betting Media</p>
<p>“If you’re a sports fan in New Jersey, Fox Bet is a game changer,” he added.</p>
<p>The features of the pre-planned platform will include Daily Bet Boosts, special offers and Custom Bets, as an added new feature, along with the above described.</p>
<p>The sports wagering portal will also keep its users in the loop with instant scores, updates on odds and game statistics, as well as news and insights, presented by Fox Sports analyst and TV presenters.</p>
<p>Daily content will be contributed by a variety of experts and sports journalists. Nick Wright and Cris Carter will be the anchormen of the morning news show called First Thing’s First, while the daily sports betting program, dubbed Lock it In, will be hosted by Rachel Bonnetta, Clay Travis, “Cousin Sal” Iacono, Todd Fuhram and Colin Cowherd.</p>
<p>Fox Bet will be replacing The Star Group’s BetStars brand in New Jersey and will ultimately aim to becoming the go-to national sports betting and media portal. Wagers will be accepted from states with active regulated sports betting legislation, but a free-play predictions game is to be available to the entire US.</p>
<p>The Stars Group and Fox Sports’ Partnership</p>
<p>A subsidiary of the Fox Corporation has just recently acquired a 4.99% stake from on and off-line betting operator PokerStars for the notable amount of $236 million and includes the possibility for Fox to increase it up to 50% before the 10th anniversary of the launch.</p>
<p>The agreement has been reportedly concluded for a 25-year period of commercial cooperation, allowing The Stars Group to promote and use a number of Fox Sport trademarks for the purposes of online wagering and the provision of game statistics, results and other data. This will, in fact, go both ways, as the sportsbook operator will be granted editorial integration in a number of digital outlets and broadcast channels. The online gambling operator will also be granted exclusive advertising benefits.</p>
<p>New Jersey just got a new book and it’s about to be historic.</p>
