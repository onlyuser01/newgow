    <h1>Laughlin Nevada Casinos Cruise Ship Casino Treasure Island Hotel Casino Shreveport Casino Hotels Win</h1>

<p>its about 4000 euro but in bitcoin. I couldnt choose BTC in your list, it changes automatically to euro. Hops its ok. My complaint:</p>
<p>I cant believe this!!</p>
<p>I was lucky and won 0.5285700 BTC and i get this email:</p>
<p>Dear Johan,</p>
<p>Please note that your withdrawal was canceled and winnings confiscated for breaching the following T&amp;C rule:</p>
<p>"To claim the deposit welcome bonus or any deposit bonus, the user must make a minimum deposit of 0.1 mBTC. For example, the player will automatically receive their first bonus after depositing an initial 0.0001 BTC. The second deposit bonus will be triggered once the player makes a second deposit of 0.1 mBTC or more. The same rule applies for the third deposit bonus. To be qualified for the weekly Monday Cashback bonus, the player should have deposited at least 0.004 BTC during the qualifying week. These bonuses are not available for players from Sweden and Croatia."</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Bitcoin Casino Support Team.</p>
<p>The rule they say i broke was that bonus is not available for Swedish players!!</p>
<p>Damn it! I got the bonus!! And i could play it and win! How can they say not available for Swedish players! It was very available because i got it! I asked in the chat very much how the bonus worked and everything looked ok. Then they come up with this! They dont like big winnings?</p>
<p>Every normal casino if they dont allow you bonus you dont get it! The bonus is available if you dont win with it has to be their thinking.</p>
<p>Hope you agree and can help me.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>/ Johan Patrik</p>
