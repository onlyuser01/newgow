    <h1>Casino Slots Free Games Casinos In Delaware Usa Casino Online Brango Casino Review Online Casino Pa</h1>

<p>I started my first withdraw at the casino two weeks ago and they requested I send them a copy of my drivers license which I did. They then requested a picture of me holding my drivers license. I sent both to the security dept and then received an email asking for another type of government identification. I told them I don't have another identification. They said my picture was a scan copy and cropped. So I told a photo of it and sent it to them. They then said it wasn't clear enough. So I took 3 more pictures in HD everyone of them was perfect and not cropped. Then I received another email telling me that identification wouldn't work and they were refunding my withdraw and I would have to start it all over again. Its clear no matter what I send them it won't be satisfactory, I give up hope you can help. From what I have read the security dept does this with almost every player when it comes to verification.</p>
<p>I told the security dept that I had an account several years ago with their sister casino Slotocash and my identification was verified Feb, 5, 2017. I used the same drivers license but that license is now 5 years older. They didn't even acknowledge it. Why did they accept the same drivers license 5 years ago and today its not good enough.</p>
