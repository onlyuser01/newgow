    <h1>Lucky Creek Casino Sky Dancer Casino Mesquite Casinos Best Vegas Casino Riverside Hotel And Casino P</h1>

<p>Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced Monday a new renovation project would see $100 million invested into the casino’s third floor to usher in a new era of entertainment in the city.</p>
<p>New High-Limit Room</p>
<p>The casino property operated by the Forest County Potawatomi will renovate more than 120,000 square feet of space located on the third floor of the venue to bring to its guests new gaming experiences and food options.</p>
<p>Commenting on the project, Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino chief executive officer and general manager Dominic Ortiz outlined the operator’s commitment from the moment the venue opened more than 30 years ago to continuously “evolve and meet the needs” of its customers and “not only elevate the brand” but affirm the venue as “the premier entertainment destination in the region.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning. Additional exciting changes and new amenities are in store. The best is truly yet to come.” Dominic Ortiz, CEO and General Manager, Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino</p>
<p>The gaming side of the property will see more than 1,800 new slot machine stations, the introduction of 28 bar-top slot seats at a new bar, cashier stations, and a brand new Fire Keeper’s Club booth for the casino’s loyalty program members, while the environment will be filled with an array of 4K television screens.</p>
<p>“Milwaukee and southeast Wisconsin has been home to the Potawatomi for hundreds of years, and this project is another example of how we are continuing to invest in and better the communities that we call home. We are excited to bring these new experiences to our guests and to continue our role as the top entertainment destination in Wisconsin.” Ned Daniels, Jr., Chairman, Forest County Potawatomi</p>
<p>The renovation at the property, which recently expanded its partnership with MLB franchise The Milwaukee Brewers, will bring a new and exclusive high-limit room offering top-notch service and featuring a craft bar, stage and gourmet kitchen with a brick oven to present visitors with experiences unmatched anywhere else in the region.</p>
<p>The skywalk and entry area of the third floor will feature modern décor, LED lighting, video walls and a sound system throughout the whole floor to offer guests a glimpse of the new energy that is waiting for them inside.</p>
<p>Food and Beverage Options</p>
<p>The Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino will add two new food and beverage options, Rock &amp; Brews restaurant and Starbucks Coffee, to further entice its guests while three new “quick service” food and beverage stations will allow them to grab a bite or have food delivered to their gaming stations.</p>
<p>Rock &amp; Brews will be located just off the skywalk at the property entry and will provide a superior dining experience with a Rock ‘n’ Roll twist. The brainchild brand of former KISS musicians Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons will offer a variety of local and craft beers and will feature a stage for live music.</p>
<p>Across from Rock &amp; Brews and off the skywalk entrance will open doors the Starbucks Coffee, a full-service location of the brand offering both beverage and food options.</p>
<p>Construction works on the renovation project are planned to complete by the spring of 2023.</p>
