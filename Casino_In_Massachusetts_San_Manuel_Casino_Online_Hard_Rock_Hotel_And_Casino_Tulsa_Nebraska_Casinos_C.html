<p>Information about Big Time Gaming games</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming, also known as BTG, started trading in 2011 when a small group of gaming experts pooled their talents together to form a collective focused on providing innovative online casino content.</p>
<p>Their CEO Nik Robinson has been in the industry since the mid 90s, when he founded New Tech Media, which went on to be snapped up by News Corp and later became part of a merger to form Openbet. They also boast the talent of Ian Schmidt, who has an impressive track record with Rock Star Games.</p>
<p>From their base in Australia, they supply content to some of the biggest names in the iGaming industry. The company has also acquired a series of licenses that allow it to operate in different markets. Other than the common, but important, Alderney and Malta certificates, it's also permitted to provide content for government lotteries, as well as branded titles based on successful TV shows and franchises.</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming casino games</p>
<p>Most of Big Time's game selection are slot titles that show off a larger-than-life aesthetic. Nowhere is this more evident than their Megaways slots, including the world-famous Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</p>
<p>Following the same format as the show, minus the host, the quality of the music and graphics makes you feel as if you're sitting in that black chair yourself. The game itself is entertaining, too, with an intriguing Mystery Box feature available from the start. The sharp symbols on the six-reel grid spin form winning lines and trigger features based on the show itself, such as the Hot Seat Free Spins gamble, where you make your way up a prize ladder, lifelines that give you extra chances, and even a Walk Away option where you get free spins without gambling.</p>
<p>Another Megaways title worth trying out is Bonanza. Featuring a nice-looking setting of a six-reel grid built into a grassy cliff, the game revolves around a 'gold rush' concept, with symbols etched into rocks and even gold carts that represent a bonus reel through which you can activate a wild. The bonus game is excellent, if a little hard to get: the background turns into a fiery night setting where the multiplier increases after each win, giving you the potential to collect some huge wins.</p>
<p>Big Time also offer some nice non-Megaways titles. Opal Fruits is one of those, giving you the chance to try out its six reels in a slick, space-themed setting, with futuristic music to match. Once you win a prize, you trigger a process in which the winning symbols are replaced by falling icons to form new win lines. Golden scatter symbols give you free spins with unlimited multipliers, and there are multiplier wilds which increase your win several times. It's a great example of Big Time's focus on excellent graphics and engaging gameplay, and you won't notice the time go by as you become immersed in the game.</p>
