<p>The Inspired Entertainment team is glad to deepen its relationship with bet365, which it praised as the biggest B2C virtual sports company in the world</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment, a leading business-to-business supplier of gambling content and technology, announced that it has extended its contract with bet365. Under the renewed deal, the provider will continue serving as the operator’s virtual sports provider.</p>
<p>Bet365 is a long-time partner of Inspired Entertainment and has leveraged its products and solutions for years. As agreed, the latter company will continue to power bet365 with its latest products and licensed games. As a result, bet365 will secure the advantage of leading content for its virtual sports portfolio.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment is known for offering the most expansive and varied content portfolio for virtual sports. It includes offerings for the most popular sports in every market. Prompted by the rising interest in virtual sports, Inspired continues to expand its content library. Over the past five years, it included products for basketball, football and women’s soccer.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment plans to soon launch virtual products for baseball as well, adding extra variety to its portfolio.</p>
<p>Inspired Is Looking Forward to Working with bet365</p>
<p>Brooks Pierce, Inspired Entertainment’s chief executive officer &amp; president, shared his thoughts on the expanded deal with bet365. He said that his team is glad to deepen its relationship with bet365, which he praised as the biggest B2C virtual sports company in the world. The operator, Pierce noted, will now offer more than 30 channels of Inspired content around the world.</p>
<p>They [bet365] were the first operator to offer our Multi-Stream Matchday and Basketball products. We’re thrilled for them to be one of the first operators to take our latest licensed products to grow their popular Inspired Virtual Sports portfolio. Brooks Pierce, CEO &amp; president, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Inspired’s virtual sports content is available with 100+ betting brands around the world, engaging sports aficionados with great betting content and over 40,000 retail channels. Players who are interested in such products can learn more on Inspired Entertainment’s official website.</p>
<p>A month ago, Inspired also extended its existing agreement with Paddy Power, agreeing to continue providing the operator with virtual sports. Thanks to this deal, even more players will be able to experience the provider’s best-in-class products.</p>
<p>A week earlier than that, the company teamed up with Cristaltec to deliver unique gaming experiences for Codere’s customers in Italy. Around the same time, Inspired also amped up its esports products through a partnership with the data platform GRID.</p>
