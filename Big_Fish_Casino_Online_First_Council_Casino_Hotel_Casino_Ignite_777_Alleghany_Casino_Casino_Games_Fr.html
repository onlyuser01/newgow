    <h1>Big Fish Casino Online First Council Casino Hotel Casino Ignite 777 Alleghany Casino Casino Games Fr</h1>

<p>So i deposit for $300 in this casino and played 1x2 gaming blackjack game but the game was absolutly broken (by that i do not mean that the dealer got a lot of 20's of bj) i mean that a lot of time i could'nt split or double my hand because a pop up popped saying "balance not enought" when the balance was largely over the amount needed. The inability to split my hands multiple times resulted in losses when, normally, if I had split (which was my intention but I literally couldn't do), I would have won many more hands than what happened.</p>
<p>also game took money for innasurence a lot of time i clicked on the no.</p>
<p>last hand i did on this blackjack game was the worst, the game took my money for the bet but after i was not able to play the hand (balance not enought again) but the casino still took the money from the account.</p>
<p>support wont even cancel that bugged hand and i explained to the support all of the bug i mentioned above.</p>
<p>the game clearly was malfounctioning at the time so casino should have refund all of my bet on this broken game.</p>
<p>Support was assuring me that the game wasn't broken even if i did show him screenshot of the bug.</p>
<p>millionz casino owe me back $300 as the game or the casino was having issue at that time.</p>
<p>i will link u down below one screenshot of a proof of malfuctioning.</p>
