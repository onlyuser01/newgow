    <h1>Walkers Bluff Casino Free Casino Slots For Fun Casino Cruise San Manuel Casino Buffet Ramada By Wynd</h1>

<p>Tomas</p>
<p>They have had 2 months to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>In that time they have told one lie after another.</p>
<p>They have NEVER contacted me once and have clearly sent you a fake email saying they have. You have continually asked for them to send you evidence which they have ignored as they don't have any evidence to back up their lies.</p>
<p>The bottom line is they are a scam/fraud website who have no intention of EVER paying out ANY money. On top of that they steal customers balances by putting them back to zero and closing the customers account.</p>
<p>They then come onto a forum and lie saying they are worried about a charge back and that is why they are keeping the balance. As I have already explained NO CHARGEBACK can be processed on a transaction carried out via "open banking". No charge back would ever be approved or be required if they weren't stealing customers balances in the first place.</p>
<p>It is apparent from this complaint and the other ongoing complaint on this complaints forum that they are never going to resolve it.</p>
<p>Can you also explain why the following posts are still showing as waiting approval? They are not showing anything sensitive and I would appreciate that anyone reading this complaint gets to read the full story.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only way to prevent any more customers being scammed by Casino Eagles would be to give them a more realist rating score of 1.0/10. At least that way customers wouldn't be fooled into thinking they were opening an account with a genuine casino. Just a thought.</p>
