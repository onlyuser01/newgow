    <h1>How To Win At The Casino With 20 Joliet Casino Harrahs Casinos In Cali Tahoe Casinos Casino In St Ig</h1>

<p>Las Vegas-based sports betting operator SuperBook Sports has announced a new sponsorship deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship professional Michael Chandler.</p>
<p>Chandler Will Popularize SuperBook’s Brand</p>
<p>This is an important moment for SuperBook Sports’ marketing endeavors as it marks the first time the company has signed such a deal with an active sports pro.</p>
<p>Kristin Mackey, the head of marketing at SuperBook Sports, spoke on the sponsorship agreement. She revealed that she is glad to have Chandler as a partner and believes the collaboration with him attests to the sportsbook’s commitment to UFC fans around the world.</p>
<p>As a part of the agreement, Chandler will propagate SuperBook Sports’ brand across his social media channels for the entirety of this week. The collaboration will tie in with Chandler’s scheduled fight against his competitor Justic Gaethje on November 6.</p>
<p>Additionally, the UFC athlete participated in an interview with SuperBook Sports’ Ron Kruck. Chandler spoke about the sportsbook and revealed that he considers them a great partner because of their authenticity, which is a quality they share with him.</p>
<p>The athlete urged his fans to choose SuperBook Sports over other sportsbook brands. He pointed out that even with so much competition from other betting companies, SuperBook Sports remain “the most proven and trusted brand in the industry.”</p>
<p>SuperBook Continues Making Strategic Moves to Fuel its Growth</p>
<p>The deal with Chandler is a big step for SuperBook Sports since the company hasn’t explored such sponsorship options before. The operator remains among the biggest ones in the US and is diligently working towards further expanding its business.</p>
<p>In June, SuperBook Sports launched its first retail location outside of Nevada by making its sportsbook available in the Lodge Casino in the city of Black Hawk, CO. This expanded on the operator’s offerings in the latter state where it had already launched its mobile sports betting app.</p>
<p>In August, the company expanded its operations to New Jersey.</p>
<p>At the beginning of September, SuperBook Sports teamed up with the University of Denver in Colorado. The latter became the second university in the state to team up with a sports betting operator as learning establishments are slowly warming up to the idea of collaborating with bookmakers and the opportunities such partnerships can bring.</p>
<p>Just recently, SuperBook Sports expanded its payment options by allowing bettors to place wagers using Paysafe’s payment solutions. Bettors in New Jersey and Colorado can currently use Paysafe to fund their bets on SuperBook Sports’ sportsbook.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Chandler will grow SuperBook Sports’ popularity even further as it continues to establish itself as one of the undisputed powerhouses in sports betting.</p>
