<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>As you know, we cannot share that kind of information with a third party.</p>
<p>The customer may leave a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) to our support and it will be act accordingly. The customer can request their full gaming and transaction history if they wish. It will be provided within 30 days. What customer wishes to do with the received information, it is their own choice.</p>
<p>But in general level, I don't see any issue with the account or with its transactions. There has not been any credits taken from the account without customer's own will.</p>
<p>If customer believes that there is a missing deposit, or similar, then we would highly recommend to contact our customer support with evidence of the deposit so we can try to track it down if it has not arrived to his Videoslots account. However, from the wording, it sounds like this is not the case. The customer is stating that he lost the funds (in betting).</p>
<p>If the customer cannot access the site due to located in restricted territory, we can do a manual withdrawal for the remaining funds. Again, the customer needs to be in contact with customer support to arrange a manual withdrawal as this may require further information and verification where to pay the remaining funds.</p>
<p>The customer may contact us directly via videoslotsteam@videoslots.com or use our live chat, which has faster response time.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Team Videoslots</p>
