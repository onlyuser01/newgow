<p>Desperate to avoid elimination, the Clippers will need to focus on avoiding another loss to the Western Conference leaders and lockdown the Warrior‚Äôs Stephen Curry. For his own part, Curry believes that the game versus the Clippers is a sealed deal for the Warriors.</p>
<p>The spreads definitely look like value betting opportunities. Game 4 finished with the Warriors prying away a convincing victory at 113-105 or well below the spread. Curry managed to clinch 25 points for his team, second only to Kevin Durant who realized 28 points during the match.</p>
<p>Can the Clippers Come Around?</p>
<p>If betting agencies are a little more skeptical right now, it‚Äôs because the Clippers have had a tough time. They lost their last three games and suffered a defeat on home turf against the Warriors. They did beat the spread, though, which shows that while a victory remains elusive, the Clippers are very much playing with determination.</p>
<p>Looking at their own stats, their star athletes couldn‚Äôt secure as many points to match the performance. Still, we saw Lou Williams secure 22 points and Montrezl Harrell tucking in 19 points. Surprisingly,the most points were scored by the Clippers rookie, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who won 25 points for his team, playing quickly and with confidence.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that the Clippers were able to catch up to the Warriors completely with the score sitting even on several occasions in the game. The Warriors just seemed to have the initiative, though, leading to the final score which the Clippers just couldn‚Äôt make up for.</p>
<p>Still, we believe that tomorrow‚Äôs game will be very enjoyable and that the Clippers, despite their bad run, stand a real chance of securing a victory against the Conference‚Äôs top-seeded team.</p>
