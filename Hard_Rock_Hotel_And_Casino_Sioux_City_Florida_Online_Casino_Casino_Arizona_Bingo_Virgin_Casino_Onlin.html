<p>WPN Finds Poker Bots Can Analyse Graphical Data</p>
<p>Bots have been a terrible plague on the online poker market, and many brands have been working hard to keep players safe. Recently, the Winning Poker Network (WPN) has made an important discovery regarding bots on their sites.</p>
<p>According to Phil Nagy, the CEO of the Winning Poker Network, the company has found out that modern poker bots are using screen scraping technology. They can analyse graphical data, which allows them to interact with actual human players in online poker hands.</p>
<p>“After running a serious of tests, WPN’s security team found that poker bots can read pixels. Using this information, the programs can determine what cards the user has, what position they are at the table, bet sizes and more”, reads a statement from Nagy.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past six months, WPN has launched four new graphics updates in hopes of stopping bots. Each update was able to prevent the bots from reading the games for a short period of time.</p>
<p>After the changes occurred, there were some online poker accounts they were less active. WPN then asked these accounts to prove that they weren’t bots and those that could not were shut down. From these accounts, over $450,000 of stolen funds were returned to players that had played with the bots.</p>
<p>The Future of the Fight Against Bots</p>
<p>This is a ground-breaking discovery in the world of online poker. More companies will be able to use this information in the fight against bots, which will take them down on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>Online poker brands are becoming more vigilant in the fight against bots. They are a huge danger, stealing thousands of dollars from human players, and sites like partypoker, WPN and PokerStars are working hard to prevent them from operating.</p>
<p>However, there is always the chance that this could have an undesired effect. If those that run bot accounts catch wind that WPN knows about bots’ ability to analyse graphical data, they will look for even more sophisticated ways of operating on online poker sites.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if all of this hard work will pay off and stop bots from targeting poker sites altogether. It may take several brands working together to make it happen, but it could have a significant effect on the number of bots operating online.</p>
