    <h1>Casino Rochester Ny Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Canada Wind Creek Casino Wetum</h1>

<p>The United Kingdom continues to seduce operators and suppliers alike, with Thunderkick, an independent slot studio keen on expanding its geographical footprint and having a stronger pull with an ever more diverse audience growing its position in the market through a tie-up with Betway, one of the leading operators in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As a result, Betway players will have access to a range of Thunderkick games, including Midas Golden Touch, Sword of Khans, Pink Elephants 2, and so much more. Betway and Thunderkick are also committed to continuing this collaboration by introducing more games together, with Thunderkick committed to bringing more titles locally.</p>
<p>Betway CEO Anthony Werkman has welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was indeed thrilled to be welcoming and expanding with content from Thunderkick.</p>
<p>"We strive to deliver the most enjoyable gaming content on our platforms and adding Thunderkick’s offering to our UK portfolio will no doubt be a hit with our customers," Werkman added.</p>
<p>Thunderkick Head of Sales Fredrik Ekholm has welcomed the opportunity to see the company expand with another prominent casino operator, and in the United Kingdom of all places.</p>
<p>"With a huge player base set to discover our games, and with so many other markets in which Betway operates, we’re confident this will be a successful partnership and pivotal in our growth strategy for the UK market and beyond," Ekholm noted.</p>
<p>Thunderkick has been growing fast across different markets in Europe and beyond. The company has been granted approval from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission in Ontario, Canada. The company similarly achieved a milestone with Skywind Group in Romania, where the company was approved to launch with the operator and its brands.</p>
<p>Other than that, the studio has been growing at a measured pace, bringing new games to markets and partners. The Swedish studio has developed a range of experiences among which are 12 Bolts of Thunder and upcoming releases such as Beat the Beast.</p>
