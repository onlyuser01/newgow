<p>Khelraja, an Asian operator claiming to offer the most authentic Indian casino website, has boosted its marketing efforts with the addition of a major local celebrity as a brand ambassador. The one joining the Khelraja family is none other than Esha Gupta, a popular Bollywood actress who will help the brand popularize iGaming across Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Gupta Joins Khelraja as Ambassador</p>
<p>Gupta is a famous actress who has agreed to promote Khelraja’s online casino and sports betting verticals. She will participate in various online and real-life activations, seeking to expand Khelraja’s brand awareness in the region.</p>
<p>The agreement was praised by Japneet Singh Sethi, Khelraja’s country manager, who said that the company already enjoys a vast fanbase in Southeast Asia. Sethi noted that the casino brand’s varied offerings are exactly what makes Khelraja exceptional and so appealing to audiences in the region. Because of that, he believes, the brand has “a natural synergy” with Esha Gupta, who is just as beloved by the people.</p>
<p>Sethi praised Gupta for her energetic personality and said that he is certain that the current partnership will speed up the company’s growth in the region and help it expand its business in the region.</p>
<p>Gupta Is Delighted to Promote iGaming</p>
<p>Speaking of Gupta, the star also shared his sentiments about the agreement. She admitted that she is delighted to become a brand ambassador of Khelraja and said that she is looking forward to working with the operator. The actress praised Khelraja for being one of the top iGaming platforms around and engaging so many people with exciting games. Gupta concluded that she herself prefers to play online and thanked the company for making such games available to local players.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be representing Khelraja as its brand ambassador and am looking forward to representing the brand’s offerings across channels. Esha Gupta, brand ambassador, Khelraja</p>
<p>What makes Khelraja exceptional are its offerings, which are tailored to the needs of Indian customers. The company prides itself on offering a genuine Indian iGaming experience.</p>
<p>Gupta isn’t the only celebrity Khelraja is working with. The ambitious Asian casino operator has existing agreements with the French soccer pro Patrice Latyr Evra. In October, on the other hand, Khelraja became the official Asian iGaming partner of the Spanish La Liga team Sevilla FC. The two parties agreed to work together until 2024, allowing Asian fans of the team to enjoy unique Sevilla-centered experiences. The agreement comes amid a rising passion for football in India, as mentioned by Khelraja’s chief executive, Viren Modi.</p>
