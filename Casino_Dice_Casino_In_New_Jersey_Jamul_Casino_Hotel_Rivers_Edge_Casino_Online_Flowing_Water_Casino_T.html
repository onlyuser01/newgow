<p>Treasures of Egypt review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The tombs of ancient Egypt are a rich source of modern myth, from the "curse of the mummy" to the exploits of Indiana Jones, but nowhere are they as ubiquitous as in the world of slots.</p>
<p>Treasures of Egypt doesn’t add much to distinguish itself from the considerable number of other Ancient Egypt slots. It offers a background of columns and hieroglyphs while the symbols are a set of canopic jars, papyrus and sarcophagus masks.</p>
<p>If you like Ancient Egypt, you might well get along with this slot, but it seems unlikely you’ll get on better with this than any other.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Treasures of Egypt does make up for its unimaginative take on Ancient Egypt by rendering it well. The slot has good graphics. The background is pretty and feels alive thanks to a series of looping animations of sand shifting and scarabs scuttling, and the reels have a range of distinctive and well drawn images, all taken from the Egyptian wing of any well-stocked museum.</p>
<p>The sound design is very well put together. Spinning the reels triggers the sound of heavy stones being rolled past each other and the music has a lilting North African style that fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Treasures of Egypt is a five reel slot with three rows and up to twenty-five win lines. Players can adjust the number of lines they wish to play.</p>
<p>There is a simple gamble feature allowing the player to bet double or nothing on the colour of the next card, or quadruple or nothing on the suit.</p>
<p>Along with this is a fast-paced Free Spin bonus, which should hit relatively frequently thanks to the medium volatility of the game.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols trigger a Free Spin bonus. Three Scatter symbols gets the player a single free spin while five will get the player ten free spins.</p>
<p>The Free Spin bonus can be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>MrSlotty does not provide information regarding return to player or volatility on any of its games. We do not feel comfortable recommending any slot that is not transparent with its stats. RTP determines how good value a slot is and volatility is key in bankroll management and determining the kind of slot strategy you want to use.</p>
<p>Other sites have listed the RTP as 94.00%. If correct, this RTP is far too low for us to recommend this slot.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested started from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01 per line. The player can play any number of lines between 1 and 25. The maximum bet on the site we tested was $/£/€25.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility on this slot is medium.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Due to the hazy RTP information, this slot is not one that we can recommend. Additionally, the medium volatility is also too low to pair well with our preferred slot strategies.</p>
<p>When coupled with the somewhat overdone theme and limited gameplay options, we strongly recommend looking elsewhere for your ancient Egyptian slot fix.</p>
