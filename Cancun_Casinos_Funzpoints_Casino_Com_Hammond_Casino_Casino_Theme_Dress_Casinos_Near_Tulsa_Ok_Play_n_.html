<p>Play’n GO is happy to deliver a brand-new experience for online casino players in Michigan through a tie-up with PokerStars, a brand best known for its card room, but also expanding rapidly in the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>The partnership between the two will see a new dedicated NHL-inspired game, featuring the Detroit Red Wings, and aptly called Winged Reelers. This collaboration indicates the cross-platform synergy opportunities between different brands, as the NHL has also been looking to expand in iGaming in a bid to boost fan engagement and drive more eyeballs on the sport.</p>
<p>A previous collaboration between the League and BetMGM saw the latter work on dedicated games borrowing heavily from the NHL’s franchises, imagery, and likeness to create new fan experiences in forms different from sports or sports betting. The Detroit Red Wings-dedicated game by Play’n GO is exclusively available in Michigan, the United States.</p>
<p>The two companies, that is Play’n GO and PokerStars are collaborating on multiple content projects globally, making the present alliance a welcome one, and a natural continuation of years of fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Play’n GO CCO Magnus Olsson hailed the opportunity to deliver a new game specifically dedicated to the Detroit Red Wings. Olsson confirmed that the company was very pleased with the resulting product and added that players are bound to love it as well:</p>
<p>"We’re confident that PokerStars players in Michigan will love this game featuring their home-state hockey team, and we of course wish the Red Wings every success for the remainder of the season."</p>
<p>PokerStars Casino Director of North America Brent Rovner has also welcomed the opportunity and welcomed the chance to work on a custom game with Play’n GO.</p>
<p>Yet, he noted that the game was also a clear hallmark of the level of commitment that PokerStars showed for its own players, seeking to bring them unique and out-of-the-box experiences that capture player tastes and build memorable experiences all the same. He was also confident in the long-term success of the title in Michigan.</p>
<p>"We're confident that this game will be a hit with our Michigan players, and we're excited to see them cheer on their favorite team while enjoying this exciting new game," Rovner wrapped up.</p>
