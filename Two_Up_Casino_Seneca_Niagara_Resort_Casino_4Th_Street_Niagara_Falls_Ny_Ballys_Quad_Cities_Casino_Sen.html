    <h1>Two Up Casino Seneca Niagara Resort Casino 4Th Street Niagara Falls Ny Ballys Quad Cities Casino Sen</h1>

<p>about 25 days ago I registered at superboss.com casino, made my first deposit. lost it, after which I made another one or 2 more, I don’t remember exactly</p>
<p>then I got an offer to make a VIP deposit of $1,000 and get some kind of big bonus.</p>
<p>I didn't plan to do it, but I got carried away with the game and did it. after that, playing some slot, I got a big win.</p>
<p>The rules for wagering the bonus were some huge amount. while I was doing it, I lost several thousand, but my balance remained about 10 thousand.</p>
<p>when I entered, I saw that the maximum withdrawal could be 1100 dollars. it was very strange.</p>
<p>Having made this conclusion, I left the game, I was very glad that I was so lucky. A few days later I see that the money does not come,</p>
<p>I went to chat with their agent, they told me to take some strange photo, I took it. Then I was told that I need another ID number.</p>
<p>it's good that all this was saved in the chat, as your agent Hope already told me, I need to add all the screenshots. I have done them all and will attach to this complaint.</p>
<p>As a result, they accepted the photos and told me to wait 21 days for some kind of verification, I was very scared, because this is something strange.</p>
<p>About 10 days passed after that, and some number from an incomprehensible country calls me in the afternoon, I don’t remember exactly what country it was, I picked up the phone, she began to say something to me in English.</p>
<p>all I understood is that this casino superboss is calling. I was a little scared and hesitated, answered something like that I don’t know English, you can speak Russian.</p>
<p>That agent's name was Alex</p>
<p>this seems to me all that I remember from the conversation, he began to ask how I replenished the balance of the cash desk, I began to remember, trying to answer correctly,</p>
<p>further from he began to ask something else, a lot of some questions about how? when?</p>
<p>what are the rates? what are the wins? Of course, I tried to remember, but I was so confused, and it took not 2 hours, but 10 days, how can I remember this.</p>
<p>In the end, he said thank you, have a nice day, but I immediately thought something was wrong. As a result, I began to think and worry every day. and today I'm trying to access the site,</p>
<p>and they tell me that my account is blocked. I went to google and found this site, immediately wrote to you in a chat, how should I be and I was answered by an employee of Hope.</p>
<p>I was told that you can file a complaint here or write to the regulator. and after a dialogue with your Hope employees, I decided to write here and try to get the casino to honestly pay the winnings,</p>
<p>after all, their reason for the block is not at all about me, I honestly won by playing their own slots. The reason for closing my account they wrote using some kind of error,</p>
<p>which gave me some advantage, but I was just playing their own games. Please help me resolve this issue. I don't know what else to write here</p>
<p>I will wait for your advice. I’ll say in advance that maybe I got confused about what happened when, but with this situation my head is spinning, I don’t understand what is happening at all,</p>
<p>as if I'm some kind of hacker who hacked into the casino site and got a win, just some kind of nonsense, thanks.</p>
