    <h1>Casino In Wheeling Wv Casino Streaming Movie Texas Online Casino Nugget Casino Wendover Nevada Funzp</h1>

<p>PLEASE HELP ME WITH SCAM FROM 1X!</p>
<p>I registered on 1xbet in 2018.</p>
<p>On August 22 2023 I place bet here again</p>
<p>1-2 bets lose, and after a couple wins</p>
<p>Then request documents, it's ok, standard procedure… BUT,</p>
<p>They asked me for documents at least 5-6 times by email, OK</p>
<p>AFTER They request my documents delivered to Mexico, confirmed by a notary. I did it…</p>
<p>After that, I already waiting for the unlock, BUT they request documents again and again by email.</p>
<p>After that all, they request Skype video call. I thought WOW the final step, but after 3 days after video call they ask me stupid questions again on the site, like " Have you ever changed your gender?"…</p>
<p>I'm facing this for the first time.</p>
<p>They just don't want to give my small winning.</p>
<p>Id - 49336087</p>
<p>Id - 49336087</p>
<p>What will the question "have you changed your gender" give you?</p>
<p>And is this the last request?</p>
<p>And every time "Security department" tell me to wait 72 hours, more time has already passed again.</p>
<p>My account is still unavailable</p>
<p>THEY let me fill out a questionnaire online, I waited 72 hours and now they ask me to print out the SAME one and send it by mail to Mexico. Exactly the SAME! What will it give you in printed form????</p>
<p>This is the second time the request to send something to Mexico (shipping to Mexico costs 100$)</p>
<p>ofc i'll do it to check what you say next</p>
<p>But if the right information was needed for the first time, now the questionnaire filled out online, which you looked at for 72 hours, is simply printed out again!</p>
<p>Do you all understand that they are just joking and this information does not give anything?</p>
<p>Its honestly funny to me already</p>
