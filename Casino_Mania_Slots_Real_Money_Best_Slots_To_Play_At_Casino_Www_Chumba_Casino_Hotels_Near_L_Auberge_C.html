<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is coming back to Vegas on Saturday, December 9, 2023, with an event titled UFC Fight Night 233, UFC on ESPN+ 91, or UFC Fight Night: Song vs. Gutiérrez in honor of its headliner fight</p>
<p>The Song Yadong vs. Chris Gutiérrez Bantamweight fight is headlining UFC on ESPN+ 91 for a reason. This is a super interesting matchup, with two well-rounded fighters famous for never giving up.</p>
<p>Our Song vs. Gutiérrez prediction is that we’re going to see a real dogfight at UFC Apex on December 16, but who will hold their fist raised high in the air in the end?</p>
<p>UFC Betting Odds Song Yadong vs. Chris Gutiérrez</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Song Yadong -383 Chris Gutiérrez +300 *Odds taken from Pinnacle Sportsbook on Monday, December 4.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : UFC Apex, Enterprise (Las Vegas), Nevada</p>
<p>: UFC Apex, Enterprise (Las Vegas), Nevada Date : Saturday, December 9, 2023</p>
<p>: Saturday, December 9, 2023 Time : 10:00 p.m. ET</p>
<p>: 10:00 p.m. ET How to Watch: ESPN+</p>
<p>Song Yadong Fighting in His Home Country for the First Time in Five Years</p>
<p>Even though he currently resides in sunny California, Song Yadong (20-7-2) is originally from Northeastern China’s Heilongjiang province. That’s where he started his professional MMA career after competing in grappling, Muay Thai, and Sanda (a.k.a. Chinese kickboxing).</p>
<p>Each of his first 20 professional fights took place in Asia, with 18 of those happening in China. Since inking a deal with the UFC, he’s fought in Asia three times, winning each time. He was supposed to fight in Asia – in Shanghai, to be precise – this coming weekend, but the UFC decided to relocate the December 9 event to Vegas.</p>
<p>The result is that he won’t be fighting on his own turf, which explains why his odds have moved slightly against him over the last couple of days – from -400 to -383.</p>
<p>Song Yadong reveals he is getting surgery on his orbital fracture next week and has been experiencing triple vision, per his IG. pic.twitter.com/2AJznvHNhj — MMA Mania (@mmamania) September 27, 2022</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Song Yadong still remains a huge favorite. The main reason is that this is a guy who always throws everything he’s got at the opponent.</p>
<p>Even in his most recent loss, which happened in September 2022, he fought like a true warrior. He lost to Cory Sandhagen by TKO, that is, doctor stoppage. This fight, however, showed that he’s tough as nails – he kept fighting even though he was having triple vision due to an orbital fracture.</p>
<p>The best thing is that he didn’t let the loss get to him. Just seven months later, he came back into the Octagon and destroyed Ricky Simon with punches. Can he do the same to Chris Gutiérrez at UFC Fight Night 233?</p>
<p>Chris Gutiérrez Fighting His First 5-Round Fight in the UFC</p>
<p>Chris Gutiérrez is 20-5-2 and has never been knocked out in his career. Actually, he’s without a loss by stoppage since losing to Raoni Barcelos by submission in the 2018 The Ultimate Fighter Finale.</p>
<p>“El Guapo” is a hell of a striker who lands over 5 significant strikes a minute. He’s also great defensively, moving fast and dodging opponent’s punches and kicks – Gutiérrez gets hit only 2.73 times a minute.</p>
<p>The American is also great when it comes to takedown defense. His TD defense is 71%, and he was taken down only 11 times in his 11 UFC fights. We say “only” because he’s fought some really good wrestlers, including Cody Durden, Frankie Edgar, and so on.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, he seems capable of going to war with his Chinese opponent at UFC Shanghai. However, there’s one thing that needs to worry him. It’s been a while since he last fought a 5-round bout.</p>
<p>In fact, he’s never done it in the UFC. Actually, his only 25-minute fight happened in a Street Combat System (SCS) event in 2015.</p>
<p>Song Yadong vs. Chris Gutiérrez Prediction</p>
<p>Our Song vs. Gutiérrez prediction is that this is going to be a great battle, which could easily win the Fight of the Night accolade. We also predict that the fight is going to last for at least three rounds, although we’re not certain it will last until the final bell.</p>
<p>When it comes to our fight-winner prediction, it’s got to be the Chinese fighter. His UFC on ESPN+ 91 odds are short for a reason – he’s a better fighter than his opponent.</p>
<p>Pick: Song Yadong</p>
