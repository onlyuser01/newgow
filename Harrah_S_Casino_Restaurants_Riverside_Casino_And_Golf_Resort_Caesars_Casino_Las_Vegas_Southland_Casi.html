<p>Jackpocket, a leading company in the United States that facilitates the purchase of lottery tickets all over the country, has announced that it is branching out into a new and exciting vertical, online casino. The news came late last week, confirming that the company has struck up a partnership with Caesars InteractiveGaming New Jersey, LLC and will, as a result, move onto the highly-contested and promising market.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is operating its own branded casino, Jackpocket Casino, and will seek to continue providing impeccable service across all of its operations, after grabbing headlines time and again that customers who have purchased a lottery ticket through the app have been able to win substantial sums, exceeding one million dollars on some occasions.</p>
<p>This New Jersey expansion with an online casino is an important litmus test for the company, which has collected enough player data, and is now willing to try competing against established companies in the rather mature iGaming market in the Garden State. Jackpocket Casino is forging ahead with a range of solutions and options, including the Jackpocket Casino app, which features blackjack, roulette, and slot gameplay. Jackpocket is also pushing with its lottery product expansion across the US.</p>
<p>Naturally, the casino will be available across a range of operating systems and devices, including tablets, smartphones, and desktop computers. Commenting on the opportunity to see Jackpocket launch in New Jersey and with this new vertical, company CEO and FounderPeter Sullivan said that he was excited to see his company enter the continuously growing iGaming space in the United States.</p>
<p>"We're excited to provide our engaged lottery user base with an easy and fun way to get involved in games we know they already love," Sullivan added, outlining that the companyâ€™s decision has been well-planned and aligned with current business milestones.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is just a beginning, though, Sullivan explains, as Jackpocket is determined to align its lottery and casino entertainment options in other markets where both verticals are actually available for players.</p>
<p>Jackpocket has said that transitioning between the lottery and casino environment will be seamless and made easy for players, with bonuses available for first-time depositors across both platforms. Jackpocket lottery customers in the meantime have been habitually in the news, as they have claimed various prizes, including a $1-million jackpot won at the very end of 2023 and another $2-million prize won earlier last October.</p>
