<p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now May Run in the Mobile Browser Safari</p>
<p>Epic Games’ battle royale mobile shooter Fortnite may find its way back to iPhones and iPads. Earlier this week, BBC reported that Nvidia developed a version of its cloud gaming service GeForce Now which may run in the mobile web browser Safari. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is currently available for Mac, Windows, Android, and Chromebook computers.</p>
<p>Currently, Apple allows only the installation of applications that are downloaded from its iOS App Store. However, for the moment the giant does not restrict third party services. So if indeed Nvidia launches GeForce Now for Safari, theoretically, Fortnite may return to iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the U.S. chipmaker has not disclosed any official information on the subject. Furthermore, in an interview for CNBC, Nvidia outlined “Fortnite is not confirmed for GeForce Now on platforms beyond PC, Mac and Android.“</p>
<p>Theoretically, if GeForce Now for Safari supports Fortnite, iPhone and iPad users may be able to play it. However, if this happens, Apple will be left without its 30% commission, which is applicable for in-app purchases.</p>
<p>The Legal Battle between Epic and Apple Continues</p>
<p>In August this year, Epic Games introduced a permanent 20% discount for any V-bucks purchased directly from Epic Games and not through the App Store. Epic explained its decision in a blog outlining that payment options via Apple or Google collect a 30% fee.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company said: “If Apple or Google lower their fees on payments in the future, Epic will pass along the savings to you.” Following the release of the permanent discount options, Fortnite was removed from the App Store and Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple.</p>
<p>Apple’s response outlined that Epic Games “took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines“. Furthermore, Apple said that the guidelines are applied equally to every developer, thus keeping the App Store safe for all users.</p>
<p>After that, Apple claimed that allegedly Epic Games has sent three emails asking for special conditions. However, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney rejected the statements. Keeping in mind that the legal battle between Apple and Epic Games continues, a trial case is set to take place in May next year.</p>
