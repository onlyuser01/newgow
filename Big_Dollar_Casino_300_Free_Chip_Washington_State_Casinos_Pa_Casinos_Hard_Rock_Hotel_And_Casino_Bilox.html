<p>Overall, during the 2023 US Poker Open, Zamani had 4 cashes. Hitting the top of the 2023 US Poker Open Leaderboard also brought a prize bonus for the poker pro. As a result, Zamani secured an additional $50,000 as a championship bonus along with a giant Golden Eagle trophy.</p>

<p>According to PGT, Chris Brewer was the first player that was eliminated from the final table, collecting a prize of $92,500. The next poker pro that left the final table was Dan Smith, who collected $148,000 for taking fifth place.</p>

<p>Petrangelo, holding a queen-ten called all-in with Zamani responding with a king-six. Although the two players had a pair each, in the end, Zamani’s top pair won him the game, eliminating Petrangelo who went home with a $444,000 prize for taking second place in Event #10.</p>
