Throughout her extensive career, Gabelica was also a part of the European Lotteries where she served as Executive Chair, Working Group for Marketing and Communications.</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement, Gabelica commented in a statement outlining that it is thrilling to join the growing team of experts at EveryMatrix. "My 20+ years of lottery and gaming experience fits perfectly with EveryMatrix, offering a diverse perspective that I will use to focus on strategies for both existing and new WLA member organizations and lottery clients," added the new Head of Lottery. Finally, Gabelica said: "EveryMatrix’s modular, API-driven solutions are ideal for global lotteries looking to launch or expand their digital presence and I’m looking forward to meeting customers at ICE 2024."</p>
