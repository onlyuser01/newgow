    <h1>Maryland Live Social Casino Casino Close To Denver Colorado Game Room Casino Casinos Massachusetts H</h1>

<p>A few weeks ago I registered at this casino, I invested 500 euros in deposits of €25, plus interest on each deposit... With the last deposit, I won money at stake, and I decided to have a balance of €1000 to be able to withdraw the money to my bank account. The next day I proceeded to send the required documents to verify my account and thus be able to withdraw the money. What I find is that by sending about 20 different documents, they are never valid, I contact support about 60 times by email, and their response, apart from being slow and not very explicit, always tells me that I have to send more documents. ... In the end it takes me a week and a half but I manage to send the required documents and they verify my account..... Finally!!! I can withdraw my money I thought..... The maximum withdrawals are €500, so first I have to make one, and then another of €500 to complete the €1000..... I make the first withdrawal of €500, and After a few days nothing happens, they don't accept it... I try to contact support again and there is no answer, I send up to 50 messages and they finally tell me "that they are aware of my withdrawal and that I will receive the as soon as possible", I feel calmer... But the next day... I log into my Black magic casino account... And my withdrawal of €500 has been cancelled, so I have to go back to request it... Without any kind of explanation... Now, not even sending 50 messages they answer me, I have requested the withdrawal again and let's see what happens... I will report this scam to all legal offices that can access anyone from home .... I have been robbed! This is how i feel!!! And from what I see in many people's comments, they have also been robbed... The positive reviews are TOTALLY FALSE, THEY DON'T HAVE A CHAT, NOR A PHONE NUMBER OR ANYTHING, they only have an email that takes two days in answering and they do not solve anything at all ..... It is a full-fledged scam!</p>
