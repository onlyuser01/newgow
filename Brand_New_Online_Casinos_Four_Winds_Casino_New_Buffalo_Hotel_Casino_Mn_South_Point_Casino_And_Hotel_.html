    <h1>Brand New Online Casinos Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Hotel Casino Mn South Point Casino And Hotel</h1>

<p>During times when major sports events have been grinded to a halt, 1xBet continues to gather popularity among the players across the world. The news coming from the sports betting operator is that the Mexican Direccion General de Juegos y Sorteos /DGIS/, has granted 1xBet a full license, boosting the gaming company’s plan to further enhance its presence in Latin America.</p>
<p>Mexicans Have Passion For Football And Boxing</p>
<p>The online sports book provider intends to offer Mexican customers access to more than 70 sports to pick from when deciding where to place wagers, but the focus primarily will be on esports, online and retail sports betting. As Mexico has two main sports, football and boxing, 1xBet will concentrate around these types of sporting events when it comes to online and retail offerings.</p>
<p>Having acquired a full license allows 1xBet to operate land-based facilities and the company is determined to establish a strong physical presence in Mexico, along the way of achieving its goal to become the number one bookmaker in the Latin American country.</p>
<p>The expansion strategy for the sports book and online gaming provider that is Barcelona’s Global Partner of the Club until June 2024 through a 5-year sponsorship deal, includes entering into partnership deals and signing sponsorship agreements to help its efforts to gain popularity.</p>
<p>Although 1xBet has several successful projects in the region already, the scale of the market in Mexico, one of the largest countries in Latin America, opens up new perspectives for it, as the country is actively seeking to develop in all sectors. Management of the gaming company has recognized the potential synergy between the quality product offering of 1xBet and the passion in nature of the Mexican people.</p>
<p>“We have huge plans which were formulated after conducting a detailed examination before entering the market and we guarantee 1xBet will do everything to raise the status of Mexico in the gaming industry to an even higher level.” 1xBet official statement</p>
<p>Mexican Market Too Large To Neglect</p>
<p>1xBet is following into the footsteps of Bet365 to become the next high-profile gaming company to enter the Mexican market. Addison Global, another company that entered Mexico officially has since collapsed, after two national regulatory bodies, the Gambling Licensing Authority in Gibraltar and the UK Gambling Commission, have stripped it from its licenses due to unpaid debt mainly to affiliates.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, 1xBet was involved in a controversy in the UK itself, when several Premier League clubs were accused of whitewashing its reputation after a Sunday Times investigation had led to the suspension of operations for the gaming company.</p>
