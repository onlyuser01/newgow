<p>Evolution, a leading business-to-business solutions provider for casino operators, continues to expand its global footprint. This time, the juggernaut supplier expanded in Armenia by launching a new live casino studio in the country.</p>
<p>Evolution Opened a New Studio</p>
<p>According to Evolution’s official announcement, the new studio will be based in Yerevan, the country’s capital. Nadezhda Abola, the company’s operations manager, will be responsible for overseeing it and ensuring everything works as intended.</p>
<p>Evolution teased that the new studio will offer an unparalleled choice of Blackjack tables, allowing even more customers to enjoy the company’s offerings. Shortly, Evolution will add Baccarat tables as well.</p>
<p>The new studio will not be Evolution’s biggest hub so far but will be moderate in size and will expand the company’s operations. As usual, most of the tables will be English-speaking as the company continues to target a global audience.</p>
<p>At the end of its announcement, Evolution, a partner of the British charity GambleAware, prompted its fans to enjoy betting responsibly.</p>
<p>The new studio is in line with Evolution’s strategy for global expansion. A few months ago, the studio opened a new tech hub in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. The studio will produce more software for the company, helping it grow even further.</p>
<p>The company’s plan for the hub is to have at least 100 workers by the end of the year. Evolution plans to scale that up in the following years and have 140 and 150 employees by the ends of 2023 and 2024 respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, the company plans to open more studios such as the one in Armenia. Its next goal is to launch studios in Canada, Madrid and Michigan.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming’s expansion follows its strong financial results for 2021. The company successfully surpassed a billion in revenues after achieving all of its major goals during the year.</p>
<p>In 2022, Evolution continues its quest to expand its global footprint through numerous strategic deals. This month, the company signed two key deals in the United States. The first one was with Soaring Eagle Gaming, a Michigan-based tribal gaming operator. As per the deal, Evolution agreed to power the operator with slots and live casino content. In mid-June, the provider also teamed up with BetRivers and agreed to supply the operator with its critically-acclaimed live casino content.</p>
