<p>Week 10 of the NFL season was a major win for the house, as oddsmakers benefited from the underdogs going 8-3-1 against the spread.</p>

<p>One of the shockers came from the Miami Dolphins – once considered perhaps the worst NFL team ever. The Fins won their second game of the year by topping the Indianapolis Colts 16-12. The Colts were favored by 12.5 points.</p>
<p>Another shocker came by way of the now 2-7 Atlanta Falcons upsetting the 7-2 New Orleans Saints. Drew Brees and company were heavy favorites, spotting the Dirty Birds 13.5 points.</p>
<p>“Huge Sunday for sportsbooks,” said ESPN sports betting journalist David Purdum. “Titans and Falcons were two biggest wins for the house, killing the bulk of parlays. Second-best Sunday of season for several books.”</p>
<p>The Tennessee Titans won a wild game against the Kansas City Chiefs 35-32. The Chiefs (6-4) were favored by 5.5 points over the Titans (5-5).</p>
<p>Lamar MVP Favorite</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens kept on rolling by destroying the Cincinnati Bengals, 49-13. Baltimore QB Lamar Jackson was 15-17 for 223 yards with three touchdowns. He also ran for 65 yards and another score.</p>
<p>The Ravens, now 7-2, have perhaps the best player in the league under center. His lone incompletion was a spiked ball. He finished the day with a perfect passer rating of 158.3 – the second time this season he’s accomplished the feat.</p>
<p>Their quarterback is the most dynamic quarterback I’ve ever seen,” said Bengals coach Zac Taylor. “I’ll be interested down the road to see how other teams try to stop him.”</p>
<p>The FanDuel sportsbook has once again lowered his NFL MVP odds. Jackson is now at +250 to win the award – implied odds of 28.57 percent, a $100 bet netting $250.</p>
<p>He shares that line with Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson. Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans QB Deshaun Watson are next at +600.</p>
<p>Casino.org writer Steve Bittenbender is the owner of a $20 bet on Jackson being the NFL MVP printed in August at 100/1 odds. The wager would net $2,000.</p>
<p>As for the winless Bengals, their ninth loss of the year only betters the team’s chances of going 0-16.</p>
<p>Niners Seek Ninth Win</p>
<p>Monday Night Football pits the perfect 8-0 San Francisco 49ers at home against the visiting 7-2 Seattle Seahawks. The Niners are favored by six points.</p>
<p>San Francisco is the last remaining unbeaten team in the NFL. FanDuel has the team’s odds of going perfect in the regular season at +1100 (implied odds of 8.33 percent). A $100 bet on that line would net $1,100 if the team can run the table to 16-0.</p>
<p>As for the Super Bowl, the defending champion New England Patriots remain the favorite at +290. They’re followed by the 49ers (+500), Saints (+700), Ravens (+750), and Packers (+1000).</p>
<p>The Seahawks will try and upset the Niners tonight, and currently sit at +3000 to win Super Bowl 54.</p>
