    <h1>House Of Fun Slots Casino Hollywood Hard Rock Casino Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino Closest</h1>

<p>Radka, I've come a long way on this journey, really.</p>
<p>I know of at least three services that allow users to receive information about roulette numbers that haven't appeared for a while. But before finding them or before they existed, I paid programmers myself, whom I found in various communities, to do what I needed to try to find the key to success. They collected and provided various data for me, calculating and grouping them as I requested. They created various scripts and bots for me to integrate into my browser, which would calculate data right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Look at the screenshots I've found, some of them dated back to 2020 during the pandemic when everyone was staying at home. I spent nights studying these lines of numbers in different colors, trying to find an answer to my question: "When is it safe to enter the game to win and leave with a profit?" I attempted to automate what Zoran (zorans71) did, paying programmers out of my own pocket.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020, in August, I discovered a service that calculates the real-time count of misses for certain bet categories and displays it on the screen! I learned about this service from a video stream by a blogger who was testing various roulette strategies. Typically, these strategies led to losses in the long run because there's no Holy Grail for prolonged play at a single table. But I learned this from watching those videos. And I can provide a link to that blogger.</p>
<p>So, he talked about this awesome service. I started using this service, and it truly helped. For almost three years, it helped me win. However, there was always something missing. I understood that just the count of non-appearances wasn't enough. I contacted developers to consider my ideas, but they seemed content with what they had. Okay, I continued to use what was available.</p>
<p>A little over a week ago, I stumbled upon a video about a new service on YouTube that does what the first service does, and much more. I've described my experience with this service in another post. It amazed me. And now I've switched to it. Today, my weekly subscription ended, and I don't plan to renew it for now since I've gone on vacation by the sea. But later, when I return, I'll get back to this service and continue working with it.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe by working with this service, I'll realize again that something is missing. Or something new will appear.</p>
<p>I can provide links to both services if necessary. And other, which didn't mention. I can write reviews about different services if it helps the community. I believe the goal in any community is to help each other. And that's what I'm trying to do, sharing my experience and expertise.</p>
<p>I simply want to tell people that there's no Holy Grail and it's impossible to constantly win sitting at a single table. There's no magic strategy. However, you can win occasionally at different tables using tools available on the market. I call it the tactic of short, swift raids. And it gives very good results.</p>
<p>I don't understand what casino rule violation you're referring to. I've read the rules of the online casinos where I play, and the restrictions were mostly about having multiple accounts or using software to place bets for the player. So, as far as I'm concerned, there's no violation on my part when using third-party software that somehow collects information and calculates statistics for players to analyze. I don't know if these services violate any online casino rules, but that seems to be a matter between the casino and the service, not between the player and the casino.</p>
<p>In general, I'm ready to be helpful and share a lot since I've researched a lot about this topic.</p>
<p>Take a look at the screenshots: they show my journey, from handwritten data in a notebook to working with modern services that automate it all (unfortunately, I don't have the ability to attach more than 5 images to show the entire history of my journey. I have way more than 5).</p>
<p>I'm always happy to answer any questions on this topic. If needed, I can provide my email for contact.</p>
