<p>Juicy Stakes Casino is launching on a strong footing in 2022, introducing a variety of new initiatives that target players who want to turn their gameplay into more fun and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>Slots and Blackjack Tournament Action Takes over at Juicy Stakes</p>
<p>The company has already launched the January Slot Tournament which is running throughout the first full week of January, to give players a warm welcome into the new year. This means that there is still time to rack up points and end up atop the pecking order for some excellent cash prizes, the company argues.</p>
<p>Players can play and pick from games such as 88 Frenzy Fortune, Jungle Stripes, and Stay Frosty. Juicy Stakes will award points for each $0.50 spin. The more points a player accumulates, the better their chances of winning a share of the $2,000, or the $400 first-place prize, are.</p>
<p>As an additional benefit, the period from January 3-9 is marked by the Blackjack Jackpot. Players stand to get a share of the $2,000 prize pool by placing a wager on the special hands in the designated games, including Tangente Blackjack, Blackjack 21, Double Draw, or Perfect Pairs.</p>
<p>Celebrating the turn of the year, Juicy Stakes Casino manager John Murphy wished players a better 2022 that would prove more successful for all. “The selection of slots and table games on offer here are guaranteed to provide great fun – and a little something extra too! What better way to welcome in 2022 than with a bundle of cash,” Murphy added.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes was previously subject to blanket enforcement action in Australia when the country’s media regulator blocked access to the casino along with other websites that had been operating without a license.</p>
