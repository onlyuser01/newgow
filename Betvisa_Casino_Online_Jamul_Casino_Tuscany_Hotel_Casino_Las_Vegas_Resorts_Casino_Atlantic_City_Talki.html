<p>Blueprint Gaming is consolidating its presence in the Italian market through a new partnership with Betsson Group’s StarCasinò. As a result, Blueprint Gaming will bring its award-winning portfolio of games to StarCasinò players who are looking to expand on their experiences with fresh gameplay features and distinct mechanics.</p>
<p>From Rick and Morty to Megaways Titles to Come to StarCasinò</p>
<p>Blueprint’s partnership with Betsson ensures that the supplier’s products will be accessible to a substantial player base in the country. Many successful slot titles will be debuted as part of the initial rollout, including The Goonies, Rick and Morty Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, and Ted, all of which are branded slots with a unique signature style.</p>
<p>Blueprint will also make sure to add its Megaways themed games, which offer thousands of possible ways to secure a win, with the paylines evolving as players progress through the game. Blueprint is already certified with the AAMS, the Italian gaming regulator, and has debuted products across several operators in the country.</p>
<p>The new partnership with Betsson’s brand will allow Blueprint to continue distinguishing itself as a leading operator in the country’s gaming market. While Italy has been very strict on the way operators may advertise and access its gaming market, suppliers such as Blueprint and operators such as Betsson have committed to local player bases and created distinct products for their entertainment.</p>
<p>Italy is still touted as one of the largest gaming markets anywhere in Europe, despite the strict mandates on gambling advertisement and the government’s continued forays against the industry.</p>
<p>Italy Continues to Draw Strong Industry Commitment to Local Market</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming director of key accounts international Samuel Haggblom commented on the partnership, pointing out that StarCasinò is a reputed name in the Italian iGaming market. He confirmed that Italy remains a key focus for Blueprint as the suppliers also seek to expand globally:</p>
<p>“In recent months we have significantly improved our international reach and made our games more accessible to players worldwide. Italy remains a key focus for Blueprint and we’re looking forward to delivering new and existing games to the likes of StarCasinò in the near future.” Blueprint Gaming director of key accounts international Samuel Haggblom</p>
<p>StarCasinò gaming manager Marco Strazzulla said that Blueprint Gaming’s reputation and portfolio of distinguished games was a sensible investment for the casino as it seeks to expand its offer in the market and deliver on trusted products.</p>
<p>“In particular, we believe the company’s range of branded games, land-based inspired content, and Megaways titles will prove to be great additions,” Strazzulla explained. StarCasinò is now looking forward to releasing Blueprint’s games to its customers in the coming months, he concluded. Previously, StarCasinò struck a similar partnership with Stakelogic.</p>
