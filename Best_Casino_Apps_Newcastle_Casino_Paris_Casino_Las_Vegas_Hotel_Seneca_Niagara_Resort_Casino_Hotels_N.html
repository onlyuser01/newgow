<p>Badan's decision comes on the heels of Barstool's tumultuous journey, including an ill-fated sale in 2023 and a subsequent buyback by company founder Dave Portnoy for a symbolic $1</p>
<p>Erika Ayers Badan, the long-standing CEO of Barstool Sports, announced her resignation on January 16, marking the end of her seven-year tenure with the company.</p>
<p>Erika Ayers Badan Plays Crucial Role in Navigating Stormy Seas at Barstool Sports</p>
<p>Badan, who joined Barstool in 2016 during its ownership by the Chernin Group, played a pivotal role in steering the ship through challenging waters. In her farewell message to Barstool staffers, she reflected on the last two years dominated by Penn Entertainment’s control, describing it as a “balancing act” and an “exercise in futility”, as reported by Variety.</p>
<p>The company changed hands twice within a year, first selling to Penn Entertainment for $550 million and then back to Portnoy for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>In her farewell note, Ayers Badan expressed that she had come to work with Dave, instantly liking and trusting him. She emphasized that there was no one better than Dave to ensure Barstool’s lasting success in the future, as originally intended.</p>
<p>Barstool Sports, known for its controversial and provocative approach to sports journalism, has undergone a significant transformation under Badan’s leadership. She leaves behind a legacy of remarkable growth, with the company’s revenue skyrocketing by 5000% during her tenure.</p>
<p>Erika Ayers Badan’s Resignation Set to Reshape Barstool</p>
<p>Despite her achievements, Badan‘s time at the helm was not without controversy. Barstool Sports, founded by the polarizing figure Dave Portnoy, faced criticism for its history of sexist language and objectification of women. Additionally, the company’s foray into the sports betting business under Penn Entertainment’s ownership did not unfold as anticipated.</p>
<p>In response to Badan’s departure, Portnoy took to social media, expressing gratitude for her contribution. Portnoy shared on X (formerly Twitter) that there was no doubt Badan was the perfect and likely the only fit for them. He mentioned that it had been quite a run, and that Barstool could not have achieved it without her. According to him, she had been everything he had dreamed she would be and more in a CEO.</p>
<p>As Barstool Sports enters a new era without Badan at the helm, the industry watches closely to see how Portnoy steers the ship. On the flip side, Badan has chosen to keep silent regarding her future plans. She mentioned that she is in the process of figuring out what she wants to build and do next.</p>
<p>The departure of Badan marks the beginning of a new chapter for both the CEO and the iconic media company she helped shape.</p>
