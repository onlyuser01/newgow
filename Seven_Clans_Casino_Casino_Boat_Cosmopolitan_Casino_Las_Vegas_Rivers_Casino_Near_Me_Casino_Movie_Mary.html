<p>Maryland Casinos Post Revenue Record in March, But Horseshoe Baltimore Struggles Continue</p>

<p>Maryland casinos have set a new monthly gross gaming revenue win record at $150,073,958. The March 2018 number represents a 6.3 percent increase on the previous year, and is nearly $9 million higher than the state’s previous all-time mark of $141.1 million.</p>

<p>MGM National Harbor once again led the way, with the DC-area casino resort reporting GGR of $60.4 million. That’s also a new record for any Maryland casino in a given month.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud of the performance of Maryland’s casino industry,” Maryland Lottery and Gaming Director Gordon Medenica said in a release. “We thank the thousands of players and customers.”</p>
<p>March was the third period where direct year-over-year comparisons could be made with all six casinos in operation. The $1.4 billion MGM National Harbor opened December 8, 2016.</p>
<p>MGM’s casino revenue was up almost 18 percent in March. Its $60.4 million monthly GGR record surpasses its previous high mark of $56.5 million set in December 2017.</p>
<p>Five of the state’s six casinos posted monthly percentage gains. Live! reported the second highest total with $24.8 million, a 0.9 percent increase.</p>
<p>The smaller regional casinos, Horseshoe Casino Perryville, Ocean Downs Casino, and Rocky Gap Casino Resort, collectively won $17.7 million. Those gambling floors respectively posted GGR increases of 2.4 percent, 26.2 percent, and 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Baltimore Struggles</p>
<p>The lone casino that did not see gross gaming revenue increase in March 2018 was Horseshoe Baltimore. The Caesars Entertainment property generated a $24.8 million win, which was a year-over-year $2.1 million loss.</p>
<p>Located southwest of the bustling Inner Harbor, Horseshoe Baltimore is near the city’s Oriole Park at Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium, home to the Ravens. But the three-tenths of a mile distance isn’t an exactly inviting walk.</p>
<p>Caesars has recently spent millions of dollars acquiring properties between the stadiums and casino. The thinking is that the Las Vegas-based company plans to develop the corridor to attract baseball and football fans to the gaming floor.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Baltimore GM Erin Chamberlin said recently the goal is to create a “great entertainment district.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, revenue continues to slide. In the first quarter, Horseshoe Baltimore reported GGR of $65.86 million, a nearly five percent decrease compared to the first three months in 2017.</p>
<p>Live! Alive</p>
<p>No casino has been more impacted by MGM National Harbor than Live! The Arundel Mills property generated GGR win of $545 million last year, a more than $108 million loss compared to 2016.</p>
<p>Live! owners The Cordish Companies is building a 310-room hotel tower to better compete with its $1.4 billion neighbor, which is located about 35 miles south. Live! will also soon offer an outdoor gaming lounge where smoking is permitted.</p>
<p>March’s revenue report showing Live! increasing gaming win by almost one percent is a major victory. For the first three months of 2018, Live! has GGR totaling $137.56 million, which is about 0.5 percent ahead of where the casino was at this time last year.</p>
