<p>In different jurisdictions, gambling regulators monitor gambling activities that can be a lottery, online casinos, sports betting or keno, among others. As regulated gambling activities, they bring tax revenue while a regulator is usually in charge of licensing and monitoring the compliance of the operators to the established framework.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, anyone can view public data related to licensed operators in the country by visiting the Gambling Commission’s website. Similarly, the gambling regulatory watchdog in Germany, Gemeinsamen Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL), also presents information regarding licensed operators. This public information enables the consumers to determine if an operator holds a license or supplies its services illegally.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, GGL released an update to its white list, adding another prominent gambling operator. In the updated version of the list, the regulator included NetBet, the globally-recognized gaming and entertainment company.</p>
<p>Within the regulated market in Germany, the company operates under the name NetBet Enterprises Limited. Judging by the updated version of GGL’s list, NetBet is permitted to legally offer its services via two different domains. Those domains are vegas.netbet.de, as well as netbet.de, the gambling watchdog explains.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Expand</p>
<p>In addition to helping users determine if an operator holds a license in Germany, GGL’s white list can also help different providers of media and advertising services. This is because some operators, that do not hold a license in the country can try and engage in advertising services, an action that would be in breach of the existing regulatory framework. Thanks to the list, such companies can ensure they are joining forces only with licensed gambling operators.</p>
<p>The update within GGL’s white list comes after only recently, the Higher Administrative Court of the State of Saxony-Anhalt confirmed that the gambling regulator can enforce penalties over breaches of the regulations from operators. The approval confirms that the GGL can impose penalties for operators that purposefully breach the regulatory framework by using affiliates to advertise their products illegally in the country.</p>
<p>Securing a spot on GGL’s white list in Germany marks an important achievement for NetBet. This is because it helps the company continue to expand its already strong presence on the Old Continent. Only recently, NetBet signed a new deal with G Games for the regulated gambling market in Italy. Although NetBet has established a strong presence in the country already, the new deal will undoubtedly help the operator reach new clients by delivering titles from G Games.</p>
