<p>The developer of online slot games and leading provider of content for the iGaming vertical, Pragmatic Play, expanded further its portfolio of content by announcing the launch of a new title. The developer revealed last week it introduced a new slot game called Sticky Bees.</p>
<p>The Sticky Bees slot offers quality graphics and features a naturalistic theme. The game uses standard card symbols in combination with sweet fruits which can be strawberries, cherries, plums, watermelons and grapes, among other fruits. The 7x7 reels slot game provides the players with a chance for big prizes and delivers engaging features such as Wilds, Free Spins and Scatters.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, shared her excitement about the slot game in a statement saying: "Joining other player favorites in the Pragmatic Play portfolio, Sticky Bees introduces a creative method of locking in wild symbols that perfectly captures the essence of the game, providing players with increasingly rewarding gameplay."</p>
<p>Finally, Cornides explained: "Wins activate tumbling reels and unlock additional chances to reveal wilds, amplifying the excitement during the captivating bonus round and offering players the chance to harvest big wins."</p>
<p>To secure a win Sticky Bees players need to form "an adjacent matching cluster of five or more symbols." Further elevating the excitement and engagement, the new game offers a tumble mechanic, which allows new symbols to fall from the top of the game. This functionality can help slot players secure additional prizes and unlock the potential for huge payouts.</p>
<p>Within the 7x7 reel slot game, up to 19 positions can be marked on each spin. From those positions, up to six can be transformed by Super Wild bee symbols that can boost the subsequent tumbles and deliver additional prizes. According to Pragmatic Play, within the base game, wilds can substitute all symbols with the exception of scatters and free spins. This, according to the developer, makes it "easier to form clusters of matching symbols."</p>
<p>Players that land a minimum of four scatters receive seven free spins in Sticky Bees. Additional spins can also be secured for further scatters that land on the reels. While this bonus round is active, the slot players can benefit from up to three Super Wild bees symbols. Wilds that land on the reels help propel the bonus, increasing the potential of the payout for the customers.</p>
<p>The release of Sticky Bees comes on the heels of other games from Pragmatic Play lately. Only recently, the company unveiled other slot hits such as Jewel Rush, Lamp of Infinity and Zeus vs Hades - Gods of War, among others.</p>
