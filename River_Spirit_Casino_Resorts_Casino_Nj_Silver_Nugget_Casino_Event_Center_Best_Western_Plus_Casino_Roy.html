    <h1>River Spirit Casino Resorts Casino Nj Silver Nugget Casino Event Center Best Western Plus Casino Roy</h1>

<p>The impending closures of three online casino brands was announced by William Hill this week as part of an ongoing strategic review at the group that is looking to concentrate on its core businesses.</p>
<p>Streamline the Business</p>
<p>The decision to discontinue operations of EuroGrand, 21 Nova and William Hill Casino Club was taken after a period of brand assessment at the group, looking to centralize its brand proposition around its core businesses, William Hill and MrGreen. William Hill acquired MrGreen in 2019.</p>
<p>“We have taken a strategic decision to close our EuroGrand, 21Nova and William Hill Casino Club brands. This comes as part of our continuous evaluation of our brands and business footprint,” William Hill said in the statement announcing the closure of the online casino brands.</p>
<p>In an email communication to its affiliates, William Hill noted the group had no other plans for further streamlining of its business, while also instructed them how to proceed with customers at the three brands that are facing imminent closure.</p>
<p>Advising its affiliate partners to remove all promotions related to the trio of brands “with immediate effect” and stop accepting new customers from Monday, November 29, William Hill stated that on Friday, November 26, all marketing materials related to the brands will be taken down from the respective websites.</p>
<p>Customers with funds at the brands will have until Monday, January 24, 2022, to play and withdraw their remaining balances. After that date, the brands will discontinue operations. Two of the brands, EuroGrand and 21 Nova, William Hill launched in 2006, while William Hill Casino Club followed suit three years later.</p>
<p>Finalizing Acquisition Deal with 888 Holdings</p>
<p>William Hill went through a dynamic period in the past 15 months, a time during which the UK-based gambling group changed hands not once but twice.</p>
<p>Initially, it was acquired by US casino giant Caesars Entertainment in a £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) deal announced in September last year but since the US casino operator was interested in owning and operating only William Hill’s US assets, the rest of the company was put up for sale.</p>
<p>There was no lack of potential suitors for the non-US assets of William Hill, among which Apollo Global, Betsson and Kindred, while Caesars was looking to recuperate at least $2 billion of the price it paid for the business. Eventually, the race was won by Gibraltar-based online gambling group 888 Holdings which offered to pay over $2.75 billion for the non-US business of William Hill.</p>
