    <h1>Century Casino Hotel Cripple Creek Doubledown Casino Promo Codes Sweepstakes Casinos Planet Hollywoo</h1>

<p>Wazdan has announced its partnership agreement with Play North has been successfully growing since last October</p>
<p>After announcing it would expand its presence in Europe by signing a partnership deal with Play North last year, the provider that is leading the way in innovation in casino game development has returned with fresh updates.</p>
<p>Wazdan Celebrates “Successful Partnership” with Play North</p>
<p>The multi-brand agreement signed with the iGaming company on a mission to offer safer and more entertaining online gaming experiences has helped Wazdan strengthen its foothold in Europe.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, a rich selection of Wazdan games has gone live with the operator. The list features iconic releases that have already gathered a massive database of players, including 9 Coins, which has received a Game of the Year nomination during the Global Gaming Awards and International Gaming Awards.</p>
<p>Another hot game part of the deal was Sizzling Kingdom: Bison, the slot that has made it on the shortlist of nominees for the WOW Slot Award organized by SlotsWise. 9 Lions is another popular game that went live with Play North. The game has won the prestigious G2E Asia Award.</p>
<p>All of Wazdan’s games are now live across the Pikakasino and Kiirkasiino brands. Both online casino platforms are known for providing quick and safe gaming experiences that always place user interface and top gaming experience at the core. Plus, Wazdan’s slots have also gone live in the Netherlands with the help of the Kansino brand.</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer Andrzej Hyla expressed their thrill regarding the collaboration between the two companies which has helped them take some of their most beloved games live across several successful brands. Hyla added Wazdan was content for being given the chance to provide their “proven, engaging games” that resonate well with registered players of the three aforementioned casino brands.</p>
<p>Play North Excited to Roll Out Wazdan’s Superb Games</p>
<p>Play North, whose motto is “putting the player at the core,” has used the voice of its director of product and customer experience Daphne Xerri to express their own views on the so far successful partnership.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the director of product expressed delight regarding the “exciting partnership” while expressing their joy in introducing Wazdan’s games to players across three of their top casinos in a large number of European gaming markets.</p>
<p>Xerri explained Play North was interested in having their brands further provide the best casino games possible while describing Wazdan’s portfolio as one with “some superb titles.”</p>
<p>Last November, Wazdan announced it would expand its foothold in Spanin via a Luckia agreement, just a few days before it bolstered its presence in Latvia with FeniBet.</p>
