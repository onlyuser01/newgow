    <h1>Casino Punta Cana Miami Club Casino Login Newyorknewyorklasvegas Casino Redding Casino Diamond Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Useruser,</p>
<p>I understand your point of view and I'm truly sorry that this happened to you. Unfortunately, if the account was permanently closed after you mentioned your gambling problem on the 18th of October, there's not much we can do. Please understand that without mentioning the gambling problem earlier, casino didn't know about your addiction. A person can lose too much money even without being addicted to gambling. Therefore we always recommend being clear and specific when communicating with casinos.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings xxx xxx,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please use this template for future references when requesting the self-exclusion. Sadly, there's nothing else we can do for you in this very case. Let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
