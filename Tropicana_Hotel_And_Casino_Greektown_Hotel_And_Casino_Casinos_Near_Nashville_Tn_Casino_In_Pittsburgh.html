<p>When the idea of mass legalization of sports gambling in the United States was first floated, sports leagues were immediately sceptical. They called the move a potentially devastating one for the integrity of their respective competitions and insisted on sportsbooks paying an integrity fee.</p>
<p>Soon after, it became clear that sports leagues too could monetize their data and get a hefty bite out of the fledgling industry. The contentious idea of an integrity fee was dropped. The rest, as they say, is history. Now, though, the National Football League has had to deal with a series of unpleasant cases involving prominent league players who have violated the organization’s anti-gambling laws.</p>
<p>Four players have been handed a suspension by the league, including Indianapolis Colts IsaiahRodgers and Rashod Berry, along with free agent Demetrius Taylor who will be suspended all throughout the 2023 season – with their punishment potentially extended even further in time. The official suspension is indefinite, which means that the league may decide to lengthen the penalty.</p>
<p>The fourth player, Nicholas Petit-Frere, from the Tennessee Titans, has been suspended six games, which is not too bad, but it would mean that the offensive tackle misses the start of the season. Things for Rodgers and Berry are not looking too good, though, as they have both been waived by their team as a result of their offenses.</p>
<p>Colts General Manager Chris Ballard insisted that integrity was of the utmost importance for the team and that the organization would do its very best to educate players, coaches, and staff on how to avoid gambling pitfalls and ensure that they uphold the highest standards in the industry.</p>
<p>ESPN has shed further light on the case, citing sources close to the matter and suggesting that Rodgers had placed 100 wagers or thereabouts – at least one of those wagers has been done on a game that involved his team. A $1,000 prop bet on over/under rushing yards has been won through the account, ESPN said.</p>
<p>Of course, athletes have been receiving the news with mixed reactions. Some, such as Rodgers were quick to become aware of their wrongdoings – others feigned ignorance in the matter arguing that they had not been informed about the policy – a good but duplicitous defense to an extent.</p>
<p>In Rogers’ case, in particular, the player has owned up and taken responsibility, seeking to make amends. This could be a mitigating factor in his ability to play in the NFL in the long term. The NFL in the meantime will be working harder on updating its anti-gambling policies.</p>
