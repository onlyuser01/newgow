<p>Wild Bandolier review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Bandolier is a Western-themed slot from Play’n Go. The word Bandolier refers to the belt used to store bullets that some cowboys could wear over their bodies in an X shape.</p>
<p>As far as storylines go, there is very little here to be noted. The slot is set in a Western town, and a Sheriff and a bandit make appearances, so it is safe to assume the story is about one catching the other.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Play’n Go has stuck with a fairly conventional approach to the design of the Wild Bandolier slot game. The grid is set in front of a Western town, with a dusty old saloon in the background. The reels are populated by imagery you would associate with the Wild West, including a revolver, a bottle of whiskey, and some cowboy boots.</p>
<p>There is a central cowboy character, but they lack the memorable design of characters from popular slots like Money Train 2 or Wanted Dead or A Wild. The soundtrack is also fairly by the numbers, sticking with a generic Western-style tune.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game for the Wild Bandolier slot is fairly basic. The slot uses a 5x3 reel set, with 20 paylines active on each spin. Winning combos are formed by landing matching combos of three or more starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>You will find an autospin option, as well as the ability to change the stake, situated around the spin button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild Bullet feature is probably the first Wild Bandolier feature you will encounter. This sees up to six bullets fired at the reels, turning six standard symbols into Wilds.</p>
<p>Random feature that adds 2 to 6 Wild symbols to the current spin</p>
<p>The Free Spins bonus can be triggered on any spin. When players land three Scatters, they will be rewarded with 10 free spins. At the start of the round, players will get to choose from three Wanted posters. This will reward either 10, 25, or 40 Wild Bullets that are guaranteed to be shot at the reels during the Free Spins.</p>
<p>There is also a multiplier present on the reels for each Free Spins. A multiplier of up to 5x is randomly selected and applied. This changes on each spin.</p>
<p>Players should also keep their eyes peeled for the Bandit Free Spin Trigger. On any random spin, the Bandit can appear and trigger the Free Spins round instantly.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Complete paytable for the Wild Bandolier slot based on a $1.50 bet</p>
<p>Everything about the Wild Bandolier slot game feels average. A maximum win of 2,000x, while not terrible, is not likely to get anybody too excited. The slot’s RTP is 96%, which is as average as you will find. The medium volatility is also not likely to excite too many players. We recommend looking for slots with high volatility in our slots strategy guide.</p>
<p>You can adjust the stake by clicking the +/- buttons under the reels, with a minimum bet of $0.10 and a maximum of $50 being available.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Western slot genre is one of the most innovative and fun around. Titles like Wanted: Dead or a Wild, Wild Duel, and Duel of the Dead Megaways are great examples of what you can do with the theme.</p>
<p>Sadly, Wild Bandolier doesn’t add anything fresh to the genre. The lack of decent winning potential and uninspired bonus features makes this an instantly forgettable offering from Play’n Go.</p>
