<p>Gaming Corps AB, a Swedish developer of iGaming products, has teamed up with aggregator and industry leader Relax Gaming for the distribution of the former’s brand-new iGaming content portfolio of products.</p>
<p>The partnership is a strategic step forward for Gaming Corps which is looking to break into more markets and gain access to new audiences. Relax Gaming’s distribution network is perfectly positioned to assist the studio to achieve just that.</p>
<p>Giving Gaming Corps the Boost They Deserve</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been preparing to work with Relax Gaming for a while now. The partnership they have been able to negotiate now, though, allows the companies to increase the pace of current and future integrations and also help with Gaming Corps’ market reach.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon welcomed the opportunity to be adding another noteworthy partner to the aggregator’s vast library. Gaming Corps will play an important role in helping Relax Gaming continue to deliver on unique and new experiences and the platform will, in turn, help Gaming Corps achieve its goals of securing a larger market share.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps CCO Mats Lundin joined the conversation and said that Relax will play a key role in what he described as an aggressive global expansion, adding:</p>
<p>“Relax Gaming has a vast network and impressive knowledge, and that made this partnership a priority for me to secure as quickly as possible. I want to extend a special thanks to Simon Hammon who early on realized the value in adding Gaming Corps to the Relax Gaming portfolio.”</p>
<p>Lundin expressed his hopes that his company’s diverse and innovative product would serve as the basis of a long and fulfilling partnership for both entities. There are still details to figure out as Relax prepares to integrate Gaming Corps’ products into its aggregator.</p>
<p>Aggregators Are Becoming the Norm in iGaming</p>
<p>This is not the first gaming aggregator deal for Gaming Corps either, but company CEO Juha Kauppinen hopes it could significantly extend its coverage. The increased interest from operators on the market in aggregators is another reason why Kauppinen feels confident adding more such partnerships is the right way forward.</p>
<p>Speaking of growing one’s footprint, Relax Gaming has been actively looking to increase its own standing in key markets. The company teamed up with William Hill in the United Kingdom and it made a quick entry in the newly-regulated Dutch gaming market, making its product immediately available and compliance-ready.</p>
