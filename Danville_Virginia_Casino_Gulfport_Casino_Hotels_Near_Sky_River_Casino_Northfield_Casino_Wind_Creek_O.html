    <h1>Danville Virginia Casino Gulfport Casino Hotels Near Sky River Casino Northfield Casino Wind Creek O</h1>

<p>The event will feature poker pros, family and friends, who will share their memories about the poker pro and legend</p>
<p>The Jubilee Theater at Horseshoe Las Vegas invites the poker community to attend a special event celebrating the life and enduring poker legacy of Doyle “Texas Dolly” Brunson that will take place at noon on July 2.</p>
<p>A Remarkable Life and Enduring Legacy</p>
<p>Organized by Brunson’s management company, Poker Royalty, LLC, in conjunction with the World Series of Poker (WSOP), The World Poker Tour (WPT) and PokerGO, the event will remind the audience of some of the most precious moments of Doyle’s poker career as seen from the eyes of his closest friends and family.</p>
<p>Poker legends Jack Binion, Lyle Berman, Dewey Tomko, Billy Baxter, Eric Drache, Phil Hellmuth, and Daniel Negreanu, as well as family members and some of Doyle’s closest friends, will be among those sharing their memories and reflections on his exemplary life and poker legacy. Brunson died at the age of 89 in May.</p>
<p>As one of the pioneers of poker, Brunson, who was active on both the high-stakes cash games scene and in tournaments throughout his career, made an indelible impact on the game, printing his name in poker history by popularizing the game since its early days and later on, globally.</p>
<p>Brunson was the first player to reach $1 million in tournament winnings and ranks second in the all-time WSOP table, where he ties with Johnny Chan and Phil Ivey with 10 bracelets, behind Phil Hellmuth with 16, as well as only one of four players to have won the WSOP Main Event more than once.</p>
<p>Texas Dolly is also one of only three players to have won WSOP bracelets in four consecutive years, as well as the first of six players to win the WSOP Main Event and a WPT title. For his enormous contribution to the game, Brunson was voted the most influential force in the world of poker by Bluff magazine in 2006.</p>
<p>Teaching Others on the Game of Poker</p>
<p>His contribution to the game spilled outside of the poker tables, revolutionizing the way poker is taught via his books, “Super/System,” “Super/System II,” and “The Godfather of Poker,” providing young poker players with resources and helping the development of the game and the poker community.</p>
<p>Organizers of the event paying tribute to Doyle’s life and poker legacy inform everyone willing to attend that the event will be free of charge and open to the public and the Jubilee Theater will open its doors half an hour before noon, while seating will be first come, first served.</p>
