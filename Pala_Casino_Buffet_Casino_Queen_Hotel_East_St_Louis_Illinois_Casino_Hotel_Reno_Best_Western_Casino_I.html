<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC), the gambling regulator in the state, announced that the gaming revenue reported by licensed operators last month hit $92 million.</p>
<p>GGR for Massachusetts’ Three Gambling Venues Hits $92M</p>
<p>On Thursday, the MGC released its latest report outlining the financial performance of the state’s three licensed casinos, Plainridge Park Casino, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor in August. Judging by the recent result, the gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the three casinos did not surpass the revenue reported for the same period last year. In fact, $92 million was the GGR reported in August this year, as well as August 2021.</p>
<p>GGR last month did not surpass the result from last year and neither did the taxes raised for the state. In total, the three operators in Massachusetts paid $25.9 million in taxes. This figure did not surpass the result reported in August 2021, when the state collected $26.2 million in taxes.</p>
<p>A breakdown provided by the MGC reveals that Encore Boston Harbor paid $14.5 million in taxes. The gambling venue is subject to a 25% tax. On the other hand, slots-only Plainridge Park Casino, which is subject to 49% tax, reported the second-highest paid taxes last month. In total, the venue paid nearly $5.9 million. Last but not least, MGM Springfield, subject to 25% taxes, paid $5.5 million in taxes last month.</p>
<p>Encore Boston Harbor Reports Highest Revenue</p>
<p>Last month, the highest GGR was reported by Encore Boston Harbor. In total, the venue reported $58.1 million in GGR, marking a slight increase when compared to the $57.9 million reported for the same period last year. According to the MGC, Encore Boston Harbor has seen $22.7 million in table games GGR, while the venue’s slots GGR last month was $35.4 million.</p>
<p>The second-highest GGR last month was reported by MGM Springfield. The venue’s GGR in August hit $22 million, up slightly from the $21.8 million reported for the same month in 2021. The $22 million in GGR breaks down to $4.5 million in table games revenue as well as $17.5 million in slots revenue.</p>
<p>Last month, Plainridge Park Casino reported the lowest GGR. The slots-only venue has seen a total of $12 million in GGR. When compared to the $12.7 million reported in August 2021, a decrease of 5.5% is observed.</p>
