<p>Provider of premium casino games Slotmill announced on Wednesday it has entered into a new distribution agreement with aggregation platform operator Games Global.</p>
<p>Access to ‘Fantastic Distribution Platform’</p>
<p>The new distribution deal between Slotmill and Games Global will see the current portfolio of slot games of the innovative game studio, as well as future titles, available to the entire network of the aggregator by the end of July.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Games Global’s chief product officer Andrew Booth welcomed Slotmill as a partner to the platform’s network, outlining the quality its amazing titles will bring to the platform.</p>
<p>“Slotmill has firmly established themselves as a recognized supplier of innovative, quality games which are sure to be well received by our customers.” Andrew Booth, Chief Product Officer, Games Global</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by a team of industry experts, Slotmill relies on flawless execution and pays meticulous attention to every detail during the design and development phases, while its games feature HD graphics and animations and well-balanced math to offer players the ultimate gaming experience.</p>
<p>“We are super excited and proud to now offer our content via Games Global and to gain access to their fantastic distribution platform and operator network.” Johan Ohman, Founder, Slotmill</p>
<p>The addition of Slotmill’s content to Games Global will significantly expand the developer’s global presence as the aggregator platform comprises a network of 260 operators and 980 global gaming brands to distribute over 3,000 game titles. It also features a record-breaking progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>Actively Expanding European Reach</p>
<p>Last month, the licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority provider of premium casino content signed an agreement with Lithuania-based Uniclub casino to deploy its portfolio of slot games on the Lithuanian market.</p>
<p>The agreement with Uniclub followed shortly after Slotmill received certification to provide its portfolio of games to the online gaming market in Romania, to extend its reach after certifications in Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Malta.</p>
<p>Also in April, Slotmill partnered with Soft2Bet to supply its current portfolio of slot games as well as future titles with the iGaming and sportsbook operator licensed in Malta, Sweden and Denmark and operating more than 10 casino websites.</p>
<p>Slotmills will deliver its content via its partnership with Relax Gaming, similar to the agreement with SuperSeven agreed in March.</p>
