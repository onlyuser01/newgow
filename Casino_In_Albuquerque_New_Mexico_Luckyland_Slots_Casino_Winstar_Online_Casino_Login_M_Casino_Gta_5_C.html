<p>Bet365 continues to gather momentum in the sports betting market in the United States. Moving forward, the brand will be available to consumers in Virginia, effectively marking the fourth state in which the company has gone live, bet365 informed in an email press release.</p>
<p>Previously, bet365 announced its debut in New Jersey, Colorado, and Ohio, quickly gaining momentum and expanding in the highly-coveted and contested North American betting market. Bet365 is launching with the Washington Commanders, the official partner for the company in the state.</p>
<p>The pair have signed a multi-year agreement which will ensure that bet365 is off to a flying start in the state, with the brand’s signage visible at the FedExField. This partnership will come with a number of other digital and broadcast elements that will help the operator boost its standing in the state.</p>
<p>Bet365 is confident that its products will appeal to sports fans in Virginia, and also to Washington Commanders fans. According to the company, its powerful in-play market solutions are some of its best features.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, a bet365 spokesperson said that Virginia was a major success for the company, having successfully launched its products in Ohio, and commenting on the brand’s further plans in the market:</p>
<p>"With a growing community of sports betting fans, the launch into Virginia marks a milestone for bet365 as we continue our US expansion."</p>
<p>The news was also welcomed by Washington Commanders CPO Ryan Moreland who said that the partnership was an exciting opportunity for fans and that bet365 will be engaging with team fans across numerous platforms.</p>
<p>Bet365 is also preparing to enter Pennsylvania and has already put the wheels in motion. The company has also been strengthening its existing product offering in some of the states it operates in. In December, the company announced a new collaboration with Sports Information Services designed to help boost the operator’s esports footprint in the Garden State.</p>
