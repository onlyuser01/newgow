    <h1>Clams Casino Recipe Tulsa Casinos Inclave Casino Free Spins Casino In Mount Pleasant Casino San Bern</h1>

<p>I played casino slots on STS casino and won 4,5k. I did a withdrawal request 24.8. and after that they have automatically canceled every withdrawal request I have made. The next point is ridiculous: Whenever I ask them why they cancel the withdrawal, they say that there was something wrong with the document I sent the to verify account and they ask for new documents to verify the account. You have no idea how many documents I have sent to them.</p>
<p>For exampe there are some documents they have asked and I have sent to them:</p>
<p>-26.8. they asked me to send me photo of id card, selfie with id card, utility bill and a bank statement. I uploaded them all to their site.</p>
<p>-27.8. they asked me an another bill. First bill I sent them was a home insurance bill. They said they don't accept home insurance bills. So I sent them now my car insurance bill.</p>
<p>Also, they asked me a bank statement again. Thei said it should be not older than a 3 months. That was confusing, as the first statement I sent them was only a couple of weeks old. Anyway I sent them a new statement.</p>
<p>After that they said me that they don't accept insurance bills at all. So I sent them my car tax bill. They responded again: "We do not accept insurance bills." That was maddness because that was not insurance bill at all as I replied them and sent samo document to them again. They also said they rejected my bank statement because "It must be for 3 months" as they said now. Anyway, there was a problem now as my bank account was opened 4.7.2022 so it was only couple of months old. They asked me to send proof of that. I ordered a proof rom my bank whick I sent them. They still refused to pay after that.</p>
<p>I need you to help me to end this maddness at it has lasted over a month now and I like also adcive ervery player to avoid STS casino as it is hardest casino to get money out in my opinion.</p>
