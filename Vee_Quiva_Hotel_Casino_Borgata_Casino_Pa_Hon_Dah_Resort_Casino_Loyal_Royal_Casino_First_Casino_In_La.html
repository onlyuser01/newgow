    <h1>Vee Quiva Hotel Casino Borgata Casino Pa Hon Dah Resort Casino Loyal Royal Casino First Casino In La</h1>

<p>I've been trying to withdraw my very first winnings for well over a month and JackpotCity Casino has been giving me a very hard time with it.</p>
<p>My ONLY withdrawal option is a wire transfer which I've attempted 3 times over the past 5 weeks. Each time I receive an email from JackpotCity Casino saying: Withdrawal: attention required, Payment Method Invalid.</p>
<p>Please note: I do have a Payz account which JackpotCity accepts payments for, but does not offer it as a withdrawal option. I've asked if it could be made available to me for withdrawal of my funds and I was only told resubmit the withdrawal by wire transfer each time.</p>
<p>On the first occasion , 15th Sept 2023, I attempted to withdraw to a MasterCard gift card but this payment could not be processed to the card. Since then I've been attempting withdrawal via wire transfer.</p>
<p>Second occasion , I immediately attempted withdrawal and received an email on 29th Sept 2023 stating: Congratulations! Your first payment has been processed. In this email it stated my payment method was SWIFT, amount CAD 900 and as part of their security procedures, their financial service provider must approve this transaction and it may take between 3-7 working days to reflect in my account.</p>
<p>On 10th October 2023, I received another email saying Payment Method Invalid; Kindly note that we are unable to process your withdrawal to you due to the following: We have received confirmation from ACH/ Swift that your account cannot receive payments. Please select another PMOP or resolve any existing account issue with ACH/ Swift.</p>
<p>I contacted support and explained it would be impossible for me to speak directly with SWIFT as they only deal with banks directly. They advised I speak with my bank to find out what the issue was.</p>
<p>I went into the bank and met with their operations manager who informed me the official wire information they gave to me on a card is CORRECT and once submitted there is no reason for them not to receive the funds into my account. I again contacted support and asked if there was an error on the form I completed resulting in it being rejected.</p>
<p>They declined to provide a reason and told me to resubmit the request for withdrawal and they would fix it on their end as they found out what was causing the problem.</p>
<p>On the third occasion I did, and ten days later on 20th October 2023, I received an email from Jessica from their support desk stating: We are pleased to advise that your withdrawal of $950 was successfully paid today 20/10/2023 via Swift. Kindly be advised that this usually takes between 3-7 working days to reflect on your end, excluding weekends.</p>
<p>The following day, 21st October 2023 I received another email stating: Congratulations! Your first payment has been processed. Congratulations on your first withdrawal! Your payment from Jackpot City has been completed and will reach you soon . JackpotCity wishes you many more wins. As part of our security procedures, our financial service provider must approve this transaction and it may take between 3-7 working days to reflect in your financial account.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 24th October 2023 I received another email stating Payment Method Invalid; Congratulations on your win at JackpotCity!</p>
<p>Kindly note that we are unable to process your withdrawal to you due to the following: Your bank account details are invalid. Please select an alternative banking option or confirm your bank details (through bank statement or voided cheque).</p>
<p>My bank statement has no SWIFT wire information on it whatsoever nor do I use cheques on that account.</p>
<p>After signing up and placing money with JackpotCity, I found Casino Guru reviews and realized JackpotCity was NOT one of the better rated casinos and had several complaints lodged against it.</p>
<p>I have not added any further funds and have been attempting to withdraw my winnings since then with no success; leading me to believe the operators of this casino are less than honest in dealing with patrons and appear to be scammers.</p>
<p>I now believe this is an attempt to frustrate me to abandon the monies I've won so that JackpotCity will keep it.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help you can provide in helping me recover my money.</p>
