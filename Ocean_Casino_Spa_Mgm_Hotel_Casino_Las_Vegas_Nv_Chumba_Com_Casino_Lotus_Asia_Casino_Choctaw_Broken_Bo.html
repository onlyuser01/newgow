    <h1>Ocean Casino Spa Mgm Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Chumba Com Casino Lotus Asia Casino Choctaw Broken Bo</h1>

<p>The collaboration will commence with the launch of six engaging games</p>
<p>Velvix, a leading slot machine manufacturer, has inked a deal with ODDSworks, a North American remote gaming server technology and interactive content provider. The collaboration aims to bring Velvix’s renowned land-based slot games into the digital realm, with a primary focus on key North American markets.</p>
<p>Velvix and ODDSworks Set to Launch Six Innovative Titles</p>
<p>The partnership will kick off with the introduction of six captivating games, spearheaded by the much-anticipated launch title, ‘Forgotten Treasures.’ This announcement comes on the heels of ‘Forgotten Treasures’ being shortlisted for Slot of the Year 2023 at the prestigious Global Gaming Awards, a recognition unveiled at this year’s G2E 2023 event in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Cyrus San, general manager and executive producer of Velvix, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, emphasizing ODDSworks’ agility and decades-long experience in the gaming industry. He stated: “We are excited about ODDSworks’ nimble and quick-to-market execution, as well as their many decades of experience in the gaming industry.”</p>
<p>ODDSworks CEO, Shridhar Joshi, echoed the sentiment, noting that Velvix’s games align perfectly with their growth strategy to expand into new domestic markets. Joshi added: “ODDSworks is pleased to provide world-class, best-of-breed differentiated slot games to our casino partners.”</p>
<p>ODDSworks EVP Steven De Mar conveyed his enthusiasm for the collaboration, expressing that Velvix was an exciting and innovative business partner. He mentioned that they were thrilled to witness the growth of their close relationship in the years to come.</p>
<p>Velvix and ODDSworks Eye Expansion into Ontario, Mexico, and Columbia</p>
<p>The initial focus of this collaboration will be on key North American markets, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Connecticut, and Quebec. As the partnership gains traction, Velvix and ODDSworks have ambitious plans for expansion into Ontario, Mexico, and Columbia, tapping into the burgeoning online gaming demand in these regions.</p>
<p>In May, Velvix actively pursued the Asian market, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines, as part of its strategic expansion. Collaborating with Jade Gaming in the Philippines, Velvix aimed to leverage its success in North America and plans to launch an initial product catalog in June, signaling a broader push into the rapidly growing Asian gaming market.</p>
<p>Velvix also recently entered the California gaming scene through a partnership with Chicken Ranch Casino in Jamestown, introducing its titles West Wanted and Battle Mania to the venue. Chicken Ranch Casino’s director of gaming, Christoph Phipps, expressed enthusiasm for the collaboration, citing the games’ compatibility with the property. Velvix’s expansion into California follows its recent ventures in Oklahoma and adds to its growing global presence.</p>
