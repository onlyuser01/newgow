<p>The part of the proposal that involved online casino gambling caught the attention of opponents, resulting in its delay</p>
<p>The voting on a proposal calling for the legalization of online sports betting and casino gambling in Brazil was delayed Wednesday amid growing concerns from Senators opposing online gambling activities. Last week, Brazil’s Senate’s Committee on Economic Affairs (CAE) approved the sports betting tax bill that called for the regulation and taxation of online casinos and sports betting.</p>
<p>The sports betting proposal has undergone changes and numerous amendments since it was introduced. One of the changes included the addition of casino gambling to the bill, a move that according to the CAE would help bring additional tax revenue.</p>
<p>The greenlighted bill by the CEA proposed a 12% tax for betting and iGaming operators along with the implementation of a 15% tax on the winnings for gamblers. Those rates were lower when compared to the initial proposal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Despite the traction last week, the progress of the sports betting proposal once again halted. On Wednesday this week, the bill was expected to be voted on by the Federal Senate. According to local media outlets, this vote was postponed amid concerns of opponents who warned about insufficient text regarding the regulation of online casino gambling within the proposal.</p>
<p>Online Casino and Sports Betting Expected to Bring Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The most recent delay comes when time is of the essence, considering that the legalization of betting is a part of the tabled budget by the Ministry of Finance for next year. Ultimately, the proposal seeks to contribute toward achieving a financial deficit of zero while at the same time not increasing public debt.</p>
<p>As a viable source of tax revenue, the legalization of sports betting is expected to contribute BRL12 billion ($2.44 billion) annually. Besides tax revenue, Brazil anticipates collecting proceeds from license fees that can be up to BRL30 million ($6.1 million), allowing three brands to operate for five years.</p>
<p>Per the new proposal, betting and iGaming activities will be restricted for anyone under 18. People suffering from problem gambling, public officials as well as employees of betting companies also won’t be permitted to engage in the activity. The Ministry of Finance would be tasked with the regulation and implementation of penalties such as fines against operators that do not comply with the established regulations.</p>
<p>Similar to other markets, Brazil anticipates the development of rules against threats in the online gambling sector, including money laundering and other crimes. Despite the recent traction, the proposal may go through additional changes. This process may also impact its approval, delaying further the legalization of sports betting in the country.</p>
