<p>BetWarrior launches mobile app with Kambi for Latin American markets</p>
<p>The companies will seek to expand into Europe next</p>
<p>Kambi continues to pick up partners capable to innovate on the company’s sportsbook platform</p>
<p>BetWarrior has released its sports betting app for Kambi Sportsbook in Latin America, planning an expansion in European markets next.</p>
<p>Kambi, BetWarrior Partnership Leads to Betting App in Latin America</p>
<p>Online gambling platform BetWarrior has successfully rolled out a freshly-minted sports betting app, as continuation of its ongoing partnership with Kambi. The launch took place on Wednesday, October 23. In June 2019, Kambi teamed up with BetWarrior giving the start-up an opportunity to shine. The pair agreed to collaborate on a sportsbook project for Kambi ahead of an anticipated launch in Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Established by former PokerStars directors Morten Tonnesen and José del Pino, as per its partnership, BetWarrior has been able to benefit from Kambi’s advanced suite APIs and leverage real-time data.</p>
<p>BetWarrior has specifically integrated the sportsbook into the Omega Core platform, a solution provided by the namesake Omega Systems as part of another landmark partnership BetWarrior signed in July.</p>
<p>Latin America is a pivotal market for both Kambi and BetWarrior. Prior to the official launch, the duo had users test the app extensively. In light of the recent success, BetWarrior and Kambi are now committed to bringing their offer to European customers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Tonnesen said that this constituted ‘a major landmark in the development of BetWarrior’.</p>
<p>‘We can now offer our users a complete mobile betting and gaming experience that stands apart from everything else out there,’ Tonnesen continued.</p>
<p>‘We set up BetWarrior with the intention of radically transforming the way people experience sports betting, and in partnership with Kambi, we have created a personalized mobile sportsbook like none other. We are hugely excited to watch the first players enjoying the action.’</p>
<p>BetWarrior and Kambi – A Match That Took Finding</p>
<p>BetWarrior and Kambi took some time to each other prior to June, 2019. To this end, the freshly established BetWarrior hired Shape, a digital product studio based in Denmark, that helped BW find a company that would be willing to work on a sportsbook together.</p>
<p>Thankfully, at the time, that was Kambi. The company’s technology proved flexible enough to dovetail with BetWarrior’s own product. Speaking on the occasion of the partnership in June, Kristian Nylén, chief executive at Kambi, commented that the Kambi Sportsbook was willing to collaborate with innovative and imaginative companies.</p>
<p>Nylén cited the experience of the BetWarrior’s executive team who were familiar with the ins and outs of the Latin American and European markets owing to their time in PokerStars. That made them a good fit for the company’s own ambitions, said Nylén.</p>
