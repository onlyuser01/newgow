<p>Dear camron</p>
<p>i understand your dissatisfaction with the outcome of your complaint, but as I have written in the complaint thread after a careful review of the evidence provided by the casino you did not pass the verification process for valid reasons, and we agree with the casino's decision.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to GDPR and other regulations that we have to follow we can’t share the evidence.</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, but please bear in mind that we are trying to help players by resolving issues between the players and the casinos if possible, and we are offering this service free of charge. Casino.guru is an independent source of information about online casinos, online casino games and acts as a mediator in resolving players’ disputes that is not controlled by any gambling operator.</p>
<p>I can assure you that we always look at each complaint independently and make our decisions based on the facts we can gather.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are forced to reject your complaint and there is no reason to reopen your complaint as the reasons for the rejection remain the same.</p>
<p>We are sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. If you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future, please do not hesitate to contact us and we will do our best to help.</p>
<p>I am on several casino sites used the same state issued ID deposited and withdrew thousands of dollars and never have had any issues. But apparently I am not entitled to know why my account got closed and my money stolen. But they had evidence or valid reasons why they did it but im not entitled to know why. So there you have it online Casinos can shut your account down steal your money and all the have to do is say they have evidence or proof of wrong doing or breaking a rule. And than never have to actually show any and drive off with your money into the sunset</p>
