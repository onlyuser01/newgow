<p>During the PokerStars Winter Series, the online poker brand will be giving away $50 million in gurantees over 3 weeks of events.</p>
<p>80 Events During PokerStars Winter Series Offer $50M in Prizes</p>
<p>For the next three weeks, players at PokerStars will be able to enjoy all sorts of exciting online poker action as the Winter Series kicks of and will last until January 13th. Over 80 events will be available for players across the web, offering up over $50 million in guarantees.</p>
<p>As is the case with most major PokerStars events, the Winter Series will be split up into three tiers. Low, medium and high level buy-ins are available, starting at $5.50 going all the way up to $10,300.</p>
<p>Win Tickets Via Spin &amp; Gos</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Spin &amp; Gos, PokerStars is providing players with the chance to win various Winter Series tickets as prizes. In $4 Spin and Gos, you can win:</p>

<p>There are also $40 Spin and Gos. In these tournaments, you have better chances of winning entry into the bigger tournaments. There are also no tickets available for events with buy-ins worth less than $109 – so, this is the best option if you’re looking to play in the big leagues this winter.</p>
<p>Prize Odds of Winning $5,200 Winter Series Main Event entry 600 in 1,000,000 $1,050 Winter Series ticket 5,000 in 1,000,000 $530 Winter Series ticket 20,000 in 1,000,000 $215 Winter Series ticket 72,508 in 1,000,000 $109 Winter Series ticket 209,980 in 1,000,000 $80 cash 691,912 in 1,000,000</p>
<p>Spin and Go events also provide players with the chance to place on Winter Series leaderboards. If you manage to place in the Top 50, you’ll also be looking at landing yourself in one of the many amazing Winter Series events that are on offer.</p>
<p>There are two separate leaderboards for $4 Spin and Gos and $40 Spin and Gos. Only the first 10 events of each type that you enter every day will count towards your place on the leaderboards. Prizes range from tickets into $11 events up to $215 events.</p>
<p>This structure is great because it gives players the option to choose which events they enter. For example, if you win a $22 ticket, you can play in any $22 event – and, there are plenty of choose from!</p>
