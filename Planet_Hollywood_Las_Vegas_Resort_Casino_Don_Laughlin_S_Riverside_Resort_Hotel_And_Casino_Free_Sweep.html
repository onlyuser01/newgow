    <h1>Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort Casino Don Laughlin S Riverside Resort Hotel And Casino Free Sweep</h1>

<p>Hello to you.</p>
<p>I've been playing Mr.Bet for about a month. I've won small prizes and received payments the next day or 3 days later after asking for a withdraw.</p>
<p>On the last 26 December, I won a big prize of 10 000.00$ You can guess that I was pretty happy about it. I'm still surprised today. It is the first time I play casino online. I was skeptical at first and I still am to this day because of the last withdraw wait.</p>
<p>I made the withdraw on the last 26 december.</p>
<p>I've waited 4 days before starting to ask questions to the live chat.</p>
<p>The first time, they told me that they were needed to verify my account. Which I understand totally.</p>
<p>I didn't received any notification from them tho. I had to contact them to know that they were needing a verification. So I started the verification process. I give them everything they need.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m french from quebec Canada. So all my papers are in French.</p>
<p>The only thing that I didn't have is the physical Visa card that I used to pay them. But I give them a picture of the original letter from the bank when I received the card. It contains my name, address and all the numbers of the Visa card.</p>
<p>From that day. The verification process has been pending. When I contact them, they say to be patient.</p>
<p>The live chat is working well. I appreciate the fact that they answer quick. That said, I don't feel that it is useful, because all they can do is repeat the same thing without knowing if there are concrete actions that are taken.</p>
<p>To be honest. I know that it is only been 5 days, but I worried about that withdraw. Lots of issues can happened. I worried that they would find an excuse and that I will not be paid. I started to look around on the net and I see all those people having to wait for weeks or for months. All I want is that they respect what they said. They say 24/48 hours politics. The wait and the not knowing are getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>The first verification pass rejected my payment mode documents. Which means that the person that will take a look may also reject the documents. It is because I did the mistake to not give them a PDF as they were asking. I saw this details afterword.</p>
<p>Because I didn't not give them a PDF but a picture of the bank letter, they may ask me to give them the other PDF document. I'm guessing another wait here. I don't want to look or sound paranoid here. I just want to be over with.</p>
<p>By reaching you now, I think I can save a lot of waiting. I think that it can quickly resolve my problem. I just want to make this winning prize real. Because I'm starting to think that it is not real.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my complains.</p>
