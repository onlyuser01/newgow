<p>Scotland proved to be a success. The gambling education program also referred to as the Gambling Education Hub, sought to reduce gambling harm and raise awareness.</p>
<p>Building on the Success of Gambling Awareness Programs</p>
<p>Considering the success of the pilot program, GambleAware announced today that it will further invest in gambling education. In fact, the gambling awareness charity has revealed that it is investing £2.5 million ($3.3 million) to help expand the Gambling Education Club across England and Wales. This reaffirms GambleAware’s commitment to reducing gambling harm and raising awareness about the dangers of gambling in young people.</p>
<p>The $3.3 million grand comes after a competitive tender process. As a result, the leading UK provider of information, support, and advice for people impacted by gambling, GamCare, will collaborate with YGAM, Aquarius Beacon, ARA, Breakeven, and Neca to introduce the gambling education program in England. On the other hand, Adferiad Recovery will spearhead the gambling education efforts in Wales.</p>
<p>Gambling Education Program Expands to England, Wales</p>
<p>The expansion of GambleAware’s program to England and Wales follows an independent evaluation. IFF Research evaluated the progress of the Gambling Education Hub in Scotland and confirmed its success. According to the independent evaluator, the pilot program improved both the awareness and knowledge of young gambling harm. Gambling education also saw an increase. Additionally, IFF Research outlined that the program: “reached over 15,800 young people resulting in increased awareness of the consequences of gambling and confidence in asking for support.”</p>
<p>GambleAware reminded the results of a 2020 study about the impact of gambling ads on children in Great Britain. The study found that 94% of the children, aged 11 to 17 years old, have been exposed to gambling ads. On average, the kids have seen six such ads. However, this will likely soon change, considering the positive impact of the Gambling Education Hub.</p>
<p>According to GambleAware, before the educational training, only 35% of the practitioners from the Scottish Gambling Educational Hub were able to identify signs of gambling harm. That number increased to 92% following the program. What’s more, eight in ten young adults that participated in the Scottish Hub admitted that they are more aware of the consequences gambling may bring. Another 84% said that they know who to ask for support if that’s needed, explained GambleAware.</p>
<p>The Hub Is Expected to Bring Meaningful Change</p>
<p>Zoë Osmond, GambleAware’s CEO, commented by saying that the delivery of the gambling education program comes at the right time, considering that many young people are now exposed to gambling. She pointed out that GambleAware hopes to see the same positive short-term result in England and Wales, just like it was observed in Scotland. Osmond added that awarding the grant to the two organizations marks an exciting moment.</p>
<p>At a time when young people are increasingly exposed to gambling, the delivery of local-focused programs for gambling education and prevention of harms has never been more important. Zoë Osmond, CEO at GambleAware</p>
<p>She reminded that GambleAware remains fully committed to “working with local organizations and stakeholders to fund and establish tailored, best-practice prevention programs.” Osmond reiterated that currently, young people in the UK are getting bombarded with gambling advertising and marketing. However, according to her, the new education program will bring meaningful change and help protect children and young people from gambling harm.</p>
