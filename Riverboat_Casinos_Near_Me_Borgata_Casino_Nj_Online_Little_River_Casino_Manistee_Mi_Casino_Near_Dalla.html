<p>After a hugely successful 2023, Evoplay, the leading developer of games for the online gambling sector, announced the launch of its first slot game for 2024. Rolling out with the start of the year, the company unveiled details for Winter Star, a new holiday-themed classic slot game that offers 20 paylines. The action-packed game stands out with quality graphics, cheerful background music and crisp sound effects.</p>
<p>The 5x3 slot game presents the reel at the center of the screen while a snowy night sky serves as a background. Evoplay's new slot game uses standard card symbols between 10 and Ace. Additionally, players of the new game can see classic slot symbols, including pears and strawberries, among other fruits.</p>
<p>Similar to other iGaming titles from Evoplay, Winter Star offers auto-play options. The high volatility slot game features an RTP of 96,04% and a maximum win of â‚¬451,200. It's no surprise that the game supports nearly two dozen languages, making it suitable for a wide range of jurisdictions across the globe.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay's CEO, shared his excitement about the fresh release in a statement. "Winter Star takes players on a thrilling journey across the night sky in search of those snowy rewards," he explained. Moreover, Evoplay's CEO added: "The Winter Star symbol offers instant prizes, whilst the Free Spins mode allows users to pick three different ways to play this feature." Finally, Kravchuk highlighted the strong start of the year with the release of Winter Star, explaining that Evoplay has exciting plans for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Back in November, Evoplay expanded its European footprint via a deal in Bulgaria with 8888.bg. At the time, the leading iGaming content supplier and developer confirmed it agreed to supply the operator with a number of its hit games. While this strategic deal helped grow 8888.bg's offering, it also propelled the reach of Evoplay's games.</p>
<p>Players who join Winter Star can expect a classic slot experience complemented by a "frosty twist." The game's Winter Star symbol serves as the Scatter Pays symbol. The symbol can appear on either reel two, three or four during the base game, as well as during Free Spins. Online players who collect between three to nine Winter Star symbols within any position on the reel secure an instant prize.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Evoplay's slot also offers a Golden Bell symbol which can appear on reels one, three and five during the base game and Free Spins. Landing three Golden Bell symbols awards the players with Free Spins.</p>
