<p>Managing director Joey Hurtado noted that the new hire more than reflects Wizard Games’ commitment to excellence</p>
<p>Wizard Games, a NeoGames-owned developer of value-driven iGaming experiences, has expanded its team with a notable addition. The company, seeking to bolster its pipeline, has appointed the seasoned veteran Yoganand Aiyadurai as director of game technology.</p>
<p>Aiyadurai Joins Wizard Games</p>
<p>Aiyadurai is an experienced veteran who has worked within the gambling industry for quite a while. His career in engineering roles spans more than 28 years and has seen him occupy tech-related positions at various companies.</p>
<p>Aiyadurai’s most notable tenure is his time at Derivco, part of the Microgaming Group, a supplier of gaming content now rebranded as Games Global. Wizard Games’ new hire spent a whopping 21 years with the competitor company and was an integral part of its tech team.</p>
<p>As the director of game technology, Aiyadurai will be responsible for closely following the latest developments in the iGaming market and using the knowledge to better Wizard Games’ future content. He will be working alongside many of the company’s senior employees to bolster the studio’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Aiyadurai’s main task will be to oversee the research and development department of the Wizard Games studio and further develop the B2B company’s IT infrastructure. His role will be crucial to making sure that Wizard Games’ production meets demand.</p>
<p>The Addition Attests to Wizard Games’ Commitment to Excellence</p>
<p>Joey Hurtado, Wizard Games’ managing director, welcomed the new hire to the company. He said that the whole team is happy to have Aiyadurai on board and is looking forward to working with him.</p>
<p>We’re continuing to go from strength to strength, and someone of his caliber will allow us to scale new heights. Joey Hurtado, MD, Wizard Games</p>
<p>Hurtado added that the company is always striving to bolster its team with talented high-profile workers such as the new appointee. He noted that the addition of Aiyadurai to the Wizard Games family “reaffirms the company’s commitment to excellence.”</p>
<p>Aiyadurai also shared his thoughts on joining the company, saying that he is thrilled to be joining the company. The new director of game technology praised Wizard Games for the impressive strides it has been making in recent times.</p>
<p>With a fantastic roadmap of content, and countless new partnerships on the horizon, it is an exciting time to be joining the team, and I look forward to helping us take the next step. Yoganand Aiyadurai, director of game tech, Wizard Games</p>
<p>Aiyadurai is the newest addition to Wizard Games’ team. In November, the studio welcomed another experienced member in its ranks namely Simon Jagdhar. The latter joined as the company’s director of game studio in November last year.</p>
