    <h1>Casino Dealer Salary Casino Bar St Croix Casino Turtle Lake Hotel Casino In Metropolis Illinois Edge</h1>

<p>Novibet, a casino operator and brand with a presence across multiple international markets, specifically Mexico, Colombia, Ireland, Finland, and Greece, has teamed up with ESA Gaming for a new content alliance that will see the acclaimed supplier deliver its ultra-lightweight and exciting game in each of the operator’s markets.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming is the author of the EasySwipe portfolio, which is a collection of titles that the company developed specifically for markets that may lack certain Internet infrastructure, and which ensures that the pace of play remains intact and entertaining. EasySwipe has been associated with bigger player retention and engagement, and Novibet will now benefit from this in multiple markets.</p>
<p>Among the games that players will be able to enjoy are such options as Fruitz &amp; Spinz, Goal Mine, Pirate Mine, Rocket Racers, and Big Fish Bonanza, with ESA Gaming offering a mix of crash and slot titles that players can enjoy wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming Head of Marketing Thomas Smallwood was excited to see his company inject its award-winning content with yet another prominent operator and brand.</p>
<p>"As we continue to expand our product offering, we are grateful to have strong partners like Novibet to help further establish ourselves as a leading provider to online operators," Smallwood added.</p>
<p>Smallwood also commended Novibet on the choice of going with ESA Gaming’s non-traditional content which has proven itself to be a driver of significant results for partner businesses. Novibet Casino Product &amp; CRM Director Foteini Matthaiou was similarly pleased with the opportunity to strengthen the Novibet content library with yet another excellent content injection.</p>
<p>"By integrating the EasySwipe portfolio we bolster our offering with unique content that is perfectly tailored to a growing mobile audience and that helps us cross-sell between different verticals," Matthaiou said.</p>
<p>Besides working with Novibet, ESA Gaming has been very serious about expanding its reach in other markets as well. For one, the supplier has recently joined Leap Gaming’sGameAggregation System (GAS), which is now allowing the developer to reach even more audiences under a Malta Gaming Authority license.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has also teamed up with REEVO, another content aggregator and developer, to continue expanding its selection of games. The unique approach to gaming has allowed ESA Gaming to overcome structural inefficiencies in local markets and bring world-class entertainment to emerging iGaming markets.</p>
