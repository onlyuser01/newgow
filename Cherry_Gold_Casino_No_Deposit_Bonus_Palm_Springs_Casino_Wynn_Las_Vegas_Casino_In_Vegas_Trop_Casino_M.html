    <h1>Cherry Gold Casino No Deposit Bonus Palm Springs Casino Wynn Las Vegas Casino In Vegas Trop Casino M</h1>

<p>As cryptocurrency casinos evolve so does the need to add new payment options that follow consumer preferences</p>
<p>BC.GAME has expanded the number of supported cryptocurrencies with the addition of the Tamadoge “meme token.” The token, $TAMA, will now be available to bet with on a variety of BC.GAME’s dice and table games, and slots, offering players a chance to deposit and withdraw their winnings in the designated currency, and even buy credits into the Tamadoge Games Arcade which features a number of pay-to-earn games.</p>
<p>BC.GAME Lists New Token to Bolster Payments</p>
<p>The listing on BC.GAME also allows players to get a quick scoop of VIP perks and access various bonuses and promotions. The casino itself is touted as a trusted and reliable gaming portal, which means that players have the added benefit of enjoying their $TAMA gaming in complete safety.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new activation, Tamadoge CEO Jon Bishop said that he was thrilled to see BC.GAME roll out the $TAMA token and enable players to access it. Bishop added that the $TAMA token has been gaining popularity and the latest listing with BC.GAME would further help with its adoption.</p>
<p>The $TAMA token is connected with the Tamadoge Games Arcade, which players can use their $TAMA BC.GAME winnings to buy credits into if they choose to. The Tamadoge Games Arcade offers play-to-earn games that can be accessed with the credits for an added bit of fun.</p>
<p>Tamadoge is still a fairly new cryptocurrency, which means that its adoption by a wider audience is still contingent on trust and an improving track record. At the time of writing, $TAMA trades at $0.02002 according to CoinMarketCap, a market analytics tool and platform.</p>
<p>Crypto Gaming Remains Ever So Popular</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency casinos have become very popular over the past year, and since the arrival of brands such as Bitcasino.io in 2014 and Sportsbet.io in 2016, which are by far the most trusted entrants in the field. They are owned by Yolo Group, an innovator and respected name in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Recently, 7777 gaming, a supplier, has teamed up to provide both brands with a range of its titles, starting with 25 games before bringing its full portfolio of 100 distinguished titles.</p>
