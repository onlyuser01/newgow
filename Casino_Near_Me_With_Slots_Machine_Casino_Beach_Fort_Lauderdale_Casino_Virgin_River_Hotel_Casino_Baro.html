<li>Juicy Stakes Poker – 200% up to $1000</li>
</ol>
<p>6 11037 players claimed the offer this month 200% up to $1000 play now</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker is definitely a great online poker site for Californian players to try. You will get started with the 200% bonus up to $1000, which is definitely a nice touch and goes above the industry average in terms of bonuses.</p>
<p>Juicy Stakes Poker focuses on providing you with a versatile experience more so than bonuses, however.

The betting limits will range from $0.01/$0.02 all the way up to $500/$1000 which makes Juicy Stakes Poker the best online poker site in California that offers high-stakes poker and brings you excellent experiences across the board.</p>

<p>Software-wise, the website is functional and will be easy to navigate from both desktop PC and mobile. You will have no issues whatsoever loading up Juicy Stakes and taking the poker experience on the go with you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everygame Poker – 200% up to $2000</li>
</ol>
<p>Everygame Poker is another trusted and reliable brand that will help you really enjoy yourself in the long run when you play poker. Players who look for a trusted and established brand can readily rely on Everygame as one of the best online poker sites in California. The 200% bonus up to $2000 will make the experience even more worthwhile if you are looking to play with a little more from the start.</p>
<p>The card room offers No Limit Texas Hold’em, Pot Limit Texas Hold’em, and Pot Limit Omaha, among other versions of the game.

Some of the events have free entry, there are many satellite events that will allow you to enter bigger events and qualify for million-dollar prize purses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blackchip Poker – 100% up to $2000</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the Winning Poker Tournament, Blackchip Poker is another great online card room to try out in California. The card room has been up and running since 2012 and it has been building its reputation one year from the next.</p>
<p>The website has plenty to bring as well, including a hybrid tournament and cash game options, double lottery Sit &amp; Go’s, and more. Blackchip Poker also strives to present players with a level playfield that makes it possible for them to excel based on skill alone. This involves satellite events as well as seven-figure showdowns with guaranteed prize pools.</p>
<p>For those more competitively minded players of online poker in California, there is plenty to do and try as part of the satellite events as well. Blackchip Poker will make it possible to start with a small budget and climb through the different tiers at your own pace.</p>
<p>One small drawback here is the rather longer cash out compared to other online poker card rooms. It will usually take from 24 to 36 hours to transact your money out of the website, which is not too bad at all. An added benefit is that you can grab the 100% bonus up to $2000 which will add to your bankroll and let you experience the card room on a solid credit.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that you will release the bulk of the bonus amount, too, but remember to focus on playing good poker rather than chasing some bonus money. From cash games to great tourneys, and so much more!</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Poker – $20 Gold Coin Package</li>
</ol>
<p>Global Poker is one of the newest online card rooms in the United States. Despite being new, though, it already shows great promise as well. The website ranks in the top five in terms of overall traffic which definitely makes it one of the most worthwhile options for Californian poker players as well.</p>
<p>Presently, Global Poker works in 49 states in the United States and it uses a system known as sweepstakes which is completely legal, and verified, and it’s the only website that will send money directly to your bank account. This means that you can be based out of California but still receive your money quickly and efficiently and never have to worry about a thing.</p>
<p>There are no fees when you use the sweepstakes to redeem your prizes and can rely on a trusted, tested, and reliable payment method. The software is truly cutting-edge, providing you with a great level of fun when looking to play and compete. On top of that, you will enjoy the platform on both desktop and mobile (iOS &amp; Android) without any drop in performance, going to show why this site is truly one of the best options you can experience right away!</p>
<p>Global Poker prefers to call itself the only legal poker site to be available in the entirety of the United States, owing to its sweepstakes model. The community has responded kindly to the website as they take the sweepstakes as a gateway to some of the most competitive online poker they can find.</p>
<p>The promos are definitely not the website’s strength, but Global Poker can provide you with tons of excellent games to try and play in real time.</p>
<ol>
<li>NLOP Poker – No Deposit Cash Prizes</li>
</ol>
<p>NLOP Poker brings the rear of this list and with some good reason, too. As one of the smallest poker sites to try in California, the card room has some catching up to do. The traffic isn’t too impressive, and big tournaments are not as frequent as with most other card rooms.</p>
<p>Yet, NLOP has a robust community that plays continuously. The biggest focus is on Texas Hold’em, and the players have a very direct approach as they look to grind low buy-in games on repeat. This creates a good dynamic where you can join and try to grow steadily in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>The tournaments are actually available at a good pace as the card room, too, hosts some excellent events, which are well-frequented especially when there is some build-up to the actual event. NLOP Poker may not be the biggest card room out there but it still has plenty of players who form its strong and robust community.</p>
<p>Best Online Poker Sites in California – Final Word</p>
<p>No matter which one you pick in the end, the online poker sites we listed here are definitely some of the best in California. They provide you with the opportunity to enjoy yourself around the clock and bring excellent and worthwhile experiences.</p>
<p>Whether you are a recreational player or someone who is looking for competition (or even to prove themselves) you will find our list to be quite satisfying.</p>
