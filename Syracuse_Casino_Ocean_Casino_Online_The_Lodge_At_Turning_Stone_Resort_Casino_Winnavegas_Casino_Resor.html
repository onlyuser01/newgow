    <h1>Syracuse Casino Ocean Casino Online The Lodge At Turning Stone Resort Casino Winnavegas Casino Resor</h1>

<p>Online casino and sports betting supplier FSB Technology Ltd has reinforced its senior management structure by adding Ian Freeman as Chief Revenue Officer.</p>
<p>A New Member for the Leading iGaming Platform Provider</p>
<p>FSB Technology has welcomed a new recruit in its management team, Ian Freeman, former Vice President of Business Development and Commercial of the PlayDigital division at IGT.</p>
<p>The company founded in 2007 and winner of the FBC Industry Innovation of the Year Award added Freeman as its new chief revenue officer.</p>
<p>After previously appointing Bob Akeret as Vice President of Operations for North America in November, FSB has now brought on Freeman onboard to fulfill one specific mission – to expand sales and speed up business development as well as establish and develop key business strategies.</p>
<p>Freeman will work directly with Dave McDowell, CEO of FBS, and will operate out of the company’s London office. The booming iGaming supplier specializing in iGaming and sports betting solution is now looking forward to a strong start of 2021.</p>
<p>Commenting on Akeret’s appointment, McDowell said he will “play a central role” in further establishing FSB in the markets the company is currently active in and that he will be a stepping-stone for success in new regions such as the United States.</p>
<p>McDowell wants to keep strengthening the company’s impressive management team and believes in Freeman’s “unrivaled knowledge, experience, and talent to drive our sales and business development teams on to even greater success,” the executive said.</p>
<p>Freeman Strengthening FSB’s Management Team</p>
<p>Since 2012, Ian Freeman has been dedicated to the gambling industry, holding executive positions in several leading firms such as Kambi, where he was a Chief Commercial Officer for five years, or in IGT, where he was in charge of expanding the company’s B2B sports offering and online casino worldwide.</p>
<p>“The FSB team have developed a very relevant, agile and scalable gaming technology and service proposition, and I am very proud to join a group of industry specialists on its exciting growth journey,” he stated.</p>
<p>Freeman says he feels excited to join FSB at such a challenging time for the company “as it looks to increase growth in both new and existing markets around the world.”</p>
<p>With millions of bets processed daily and over 3000 casino games, the company has proven in the past few years to be a leader in the sports betting and iGaming sectors thanks to its cutting-edge technologies for casino installations.</p>
