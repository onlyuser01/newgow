<p>Real Madrid Determined to Defend the UCL Title</p>
<p>Los Blancos are the reigning champions of the UCL, who won the title last year even though they weren’t among the top favorites at the start of the season. In fact, up until the semifinal stage, not many believed Carlo Ancelotti’s boys were gonna pull it off.</p>
<p>Actually, when they lost 4-3 to Man City in the first leg of last season’s Champions League semifinal, most pundits thought their journey was over. But then in the rematch – played in Madrid – they defeated the visitors from England 2-1 in regulation, thus taking the game to extra time. Both of those goals were scored by Rodrygo – in the 90th and the 91st minute of the game.</p>
<p>It was the fifth minute of the first extra time period when Karim Benzema scored a penalty, which later proved to be the match-winner.</p>
<p>Both players who scored for Real Madrid in that game are still on this team’s roster. And both are having a pretty good season. Benzema’s scored 28 goals in 36 games in all competitions, while Rodrygo is Real Madrid’s player with the most appearances in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>Manchester City Still Dreaming of the Champions League Trophy</p>
<p>The Cityzens have won practically everything in England since Pep Guardiola’s been in charge of the club. However, they haven’t done much on the continent. They’re still without a Champions League trophy, which is the one they’ve been dreaming of for the past 10+ years.</p>
<p>They did come very close to winning it in the last two years. In 2020, they reached the UCL final, but Chelsea crushed their dreams. Last year, it was Real Madrid who knocked them out in the semifinal. Is now the time for revenge?</p>
<p>It might be. Pep’s team looks way stronger than before, mainly because in 2023, the Cityzens have Erling Haaland. This guy’s been incredible since coming to England, scoring right, left, and center. Not only is he the scoring leader of the Premier League, but he’s also the top-scorer in the Champions League with 12 goals to his name.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>Each of the previous five Real Madrid vs Manchester City duels saw at least three goals scored. We think the same is going to happen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The last time these two played at Santiago Bernabeu, it was Real Madrid that scored three goals. This time, we think it’s going to be the other way around.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
