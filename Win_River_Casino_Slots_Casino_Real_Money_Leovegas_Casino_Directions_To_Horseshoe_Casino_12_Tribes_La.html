<p>Galaxy Entertainment Group’s former executive Jit Ng has been appointed as Hoiana’s new chief marketing officer (CMO). His main responsibility will be to help the resort drive more growth in the upcoming years, under the supervision of the company’s president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>$4 Billion Development Plans for Hoiana Resort</p>
<p>Reuniting state-of-the-art accommodation with top-tier golfing options and loads of vibrant entertainment opportunities, Hoiana Resort is the pioneer integrated resort in Vietnam. The resort that opened its gates to the public in 2020 is managed by Rosewood Hotel Group and has a massive $4 billion expansion plan for the upcoming years. Hoiana plans on using the money to create new attractions for tourists, including a village entirely dedicated to retailers, more residential spaces, and fresh cultural and entertainment options. At the end of the project, Hoiana will spread across 985.5 hectares of property by the beach. Jit Ng’s appointment is a crucial step of the growth.</p>
<p>Jit Ng’s Responsibilities as Hoiana’s New CMO</p>
<p>Counting over 25 years of experience in driving the growth of brands and creating business innovation across a variety of fields including luxury and car brands, Jit Ng aims to work with “passionate entrepreneurs to create sensational businesses”. Accordingly, Jit Ng is ready to help the Hoiana Resort reach new markets and attract new customers in the upcoming years. He is Galaxy Entertainment Group’s former assistant to senior vice president in the Resort Marketing Services department between 2014 and 2020. He also held a number of senior positions with an advertising company in Shanghai and he was managing director for RMG connect, business director for OgilvyOne Worldwide, general manager of XM Malaysia, and IT manager for Bates Malaysia.</p>
<p>As the company’s new MCO, Jit Ng will report straight to Hoiana’s president and primarily do his best to make the brand popular worldwide. To do this, he will drive growth in the current markets while penetrating new markets and creating strategic plans for the development of all marketing solutions.</p>
<p>Jit Ng believes his primary role as Hoiana’s chief marketing officer will be to establish the exact trajectory for the company’s growth. He also plans on clarifying the brand’s vision and goals and finding the best people who can implement them. Jit Ng feels Hoiana should take advantage of the fact that it is still a relatively new face in the industry and continuously “listen, collaborate, adapt and change”.</p>
<p>As the most exciting beachside destination in Asia, Hoiana has an excellent outlook for the upcoming years and the strategic move of the board is expected to speed up the process.</p>
