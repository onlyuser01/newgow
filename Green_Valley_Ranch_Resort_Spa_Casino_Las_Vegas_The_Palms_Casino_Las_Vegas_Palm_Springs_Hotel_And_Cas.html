<p>The global provider of digital and retail products, services and technology that benefit lotteries and sports betting operators, Scientific Games, announced a senior-level appointment on Wednesday. The company revealed it hired the services of the expert Christine M. Wechsler. Joining Scientific Games, she was appointed to the role of Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Affairs.</p>
<p>Overall, Wechsler brings more than two decades of experience in the legal sector after assisting businesses and governmental agencies. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Classics degree from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Additionally, Wechsler has a Juris Doctor degree from Temple University's Beasley School of Law.</p>
<p>Jim Schultz, Scientific Games' Executive Vice President, Global Public Policy and Government Affairs, shared his excitement about the recent appointment in a statement. "Scientific Games is dedicated to building and maintaining positive relationships with every governing body we serve," he explained.</p>
<p>Schultz pointed out that Wechsler has a track record in the legal vertical and a deep understanding of public policy. He outlined that she was able to accumulate this experience by collaborating with businesses, as well as governmental structures. Finally, Schultz added: "She brings legislative and advocacy expertise to the team that will help foster further growth in the iLottery space across the country."</p>
<p>Before becoming a part of Scientific Games' C-suite, Wechsler collaborated with Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis LLP as a partner. Before that, she held a strategic role in Pennsylvania. At the time, Wechsler was Executive Deputy General Counsel to the Governor of the state.</p>
<p>Wechsler's background includes more senior-level roles with governmental structures. For nearly 10 years she was with the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office where she served as Assistant District Attorney. This was a dual role for Wechsler as she was Legislative Liaison for the state's District Attorneys Association as well as Assistant Chief of the Policy and Legislation Unit.</p>
<p>This extensive experience is undoubtedly going to help Wechsler in her new role with Scientific Games. As Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Government Affairs, she will collaborate with the company's C-suite and provide strategic guidance for public policy, government affairs and other strategic processes. This, in turn, is expected to help Scientific Games grow further on a global scale and effectively engage with more government-regulated lotteries.</p>
<p>Only recently, Scientific Games was recognized by the 2023 SBC Awards North America. The prestigious event awarded the company with the Lottery Supplier of the Year Award, recognizing it for its leadership within the lottery vertical.</p>
