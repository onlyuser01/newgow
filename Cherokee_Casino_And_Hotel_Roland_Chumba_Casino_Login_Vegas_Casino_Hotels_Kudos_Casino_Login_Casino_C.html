<p>Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles and DraftKings have announced that they are going to be opening a dedicated retail sportsbook this Wednesday, November 10. The opening of the sportsbook at Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles will take place at 2 pm local time and is subject to pending licensure and regulatory approvals, the companies said in a joint press release.</p>
<p>Starting out as Retail, Shifting into Mobile</p>
<p>Louisiana sports fans who are of the legal gambling age of 21 will be able to attend in place and visit the retail DraftKings Sportsbook. Online betting will be launched at a later date, the companies explained. Once mobile betting is authorized, sports bettors in Louisiana will also be extended the courtesy to bet directly through their smartphones and the DraftKings Sportsbook at a later point.</p>
<p>Commenting on the progress achieved so far, Gerry Del Prete, SVP of Gaming for Fertitta Entertainment, which is the managing company of the casino, detailed the hard work that had gone in preparing the casino and sportsbook:</p>
<p>“Our team has worked diligently alongside state legislators to make the sportsbook experience a reality for Louisiana patrons. Coupling the Golden Nugget’s dynamic gaming network with DraftKing’s innovative tech and trading makes for an unmatched partnership. We are thrilled to offer our combined customer base an unparalleled experience at the Golden Nugget Lake Charles.” Gerry Del Prete, SVP of Gaming for Fertitta Entertainment</p>
<p>The DraftKings Sportsbook will be the biggest in Lake Charles and will feature six ticket cages as well as 30 self-service kiosks all throughout the casino floor. This will result in a better experience for sports bettors and the sportsbook itself will be able to handle high volumes of gamblers at the same time.</p>
<p>DraftKings Builds up Its Legacy in Louisiana</p>
<p>The sportsbook sprawls on some 10,000 square feet and has 300 seats as well as odds boards, big TV screens. All of this is coming as the company is working on a permanent location for the sportsbook which is expected to arrive in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>DraftKings NA president and co-founder Matt Kalish is confident that the company is able to deliver on a top-of-the-range experience to sports fans in Louisiana. He has cited the company’s extensive experience in covering numerous big leagues, including the NFL, NBA, NHL, and NCAA contests.</p>
<p>Joining forces with Golden Nugget is a step forward for the company to bring even more worthwhile sports betting opportunities in the Bayou State. At the same time, Golden Nugget Casino Lake Charles is fully committed to upholding responsible gambling practices. DraftKings is home to exciting contests where sports bettors can snatch seven-figure prizes.</p>
<p>The company has numerous partnerships with the big sports leagues of America, including the NBA, the NHL, the NFL, and others. DraftKings attempted to purchase Entain in a bid that was withdrawn just a few days ago.</p>
