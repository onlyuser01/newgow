    <h1>Detroit Motor City Casino Harrahs Casino Hotel Chumba Casino Play St Ignace Casino The Palms Casino</h1>

<p>Hey there!!! Thank you so much for your reply. It feels nice to finally have someone willing to assist me in this matter. In response to your message....."Yes!!! I have definitely submitted all of the verification documents that they requested. " Then I received another message stating that it wasn't sufficient. So I filed another verification request to fulfill their needs. That was approved. So I filed for the withdrawal. I was under the impression that everything was cosher. But then I went back to check my withdrawal process. And it wasn't there at all!?!? So I contacted them in regards to that. Well I then received a message from their "Accounting Manager" and he stated my "SWIFT CODE" was not correct, so they rejected it when it was sent. They then stated they had refunded my money and asked that I would resubmit my withdrawal. Changing the swift code. My financial institution does not use swift codes. They stated that they don't use swift codes. That those are generally used for international wire transfers. They advised me to use my routing number. Now mind you.....I only used the number for the swift code that THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ASVISED ME TO USE!!! WHICH WAS WHY IT WAS REJECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! SO THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF!!! But I resubmitted the withdrawal request like they specified. They said in the email from the Accounting manager that it would be prioritized and taken care of that day if I resubmitted the proper information. They also advised me to accept bit coin and I would have my funds immediately. Well that's the other problem. They only gave me back $250. I won almost $600. Now because it was a "promotion" I was only allowed to claim $250. The rest of the funds were claimed by them. I have to pay a $52 fee to file the wire transfer. So that means because they only gave me back $250 which was the only amount I could claim!!! I have to now pay the transfer fee out of the $250 they gave me back!!! That only leaves me with a $200 claim?!?! So I contacted customer support and also submitted another email to that Accounting manager expressing my concerns and frustration. However NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!! I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY WINNINGS EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ASKED FOR!!! NOT ONLY THAT....BUT I HAVE ALSO LOST OUT ON ANOTHER $50. Now would you consider that fair?? I mean I have done EVERYTHING PROPERLY!!! And they just always seem to come up with a reason why they can't pay me!!! Then when I have fixed everything and done everything they have asked me to do....they still have not processed my withdrawal request. So I don't know what to do?? I'm at a total loss for words. I am pissed off and also hurt. I was really needing this money. Honestly, my grandson is extremely sick. We are trying to obtain money for a surgery he needs that's NOT COVERED UNDER INSURANCE!!! I am so sick of being jacked around when I have done everything they asked of me. I mean I accepted the promotion. I have made deposits to them. So it's not like I just used their promotional money and not actually paid them some money. Ya know?? I had to gamble atleast $4,000 dollars to be able and compete the promotion in order to even win the money!!! I thought that was extremely unfair. But you know what?? I MADE IT THROUGH!!! That I think was an awesome thing to accomplish. And then when I go to request my money, my winnings. Well then it's "You can only cash out &amp; claim $250 of the $600 you won" and "You you didn't submit the documents we are requesting" Well some of them were "fishy".....like for instance, they asked for a pic of the front &amp; back of my ID. Along with a selfie holding it. They asked for a pic of my credit card - FRONT &amp; BACK. I mean I don't want them having that info. They could steal my money. Because they have my address, my pic, a pic of my ID &amp; ALL MY CREDIT CARD INFO?!?! That's just not right to me?? Thar seems fraudulent. I mean doesn't it?? But because I need the money, I gave them that information. And now I feel like I'm definitely being used. Because no one is contacting me back?? And my withdrawal request has not even been looked at?!?! So now I'm getting worried. I mean I need someone to help me?? Can you please, PLEASE HELP ME üôè üò™</p>
