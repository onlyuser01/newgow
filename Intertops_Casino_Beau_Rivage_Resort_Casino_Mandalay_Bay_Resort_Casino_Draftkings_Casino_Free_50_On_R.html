    <h1>Intertops Casino Beau Rivage Resort Casino Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Draftkings Casino Free 50 On R</h1>

<p>I'm experiencing some confusion here, and from what I've read, I was hoping you could help clarify this issue I'm having. I've been playing on bet mexico but I've been losing a lot. Unusually, it seems like there's no RTP, or return to player, on my investments. When I brought this up with customer service, they stated that they are well-regulated and made some other excuses. However, what caught my attention was when I questioned them about the RTP, I was told their games don't operate with RTP. Meanwhile, the game descriptions indicate that they do in fact come with RTP. This essentially communicates to me that they're not regulated by anyone, and they pay out as they please, without any randomness in play. How can they return some of the investment to the player if they don't have an RTP and they pay out when they feel like it? Also, when I asked about my balance, I feel like they were dishonest about how much I have deposited and withdrawn. When I pressed them further, they simply stopped responding. This makes me question whether it's a scam or something. It's frustrating, I want my money back given that they haven't been transparent at all and it feels like a scam. I would like to know what can be done in this situation.</p>
