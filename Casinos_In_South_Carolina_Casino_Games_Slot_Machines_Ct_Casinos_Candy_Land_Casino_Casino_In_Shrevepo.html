<p>Tupelo Honey and Las Vegas television station KVVU FOX5, both owned by Gray Television, announced today a new syndicated series of sports betting, BEAT THE ODDS, is set to launch its pilot on February 11.</p>
<p>‘A Different Type of Sports Betting Show’</p>
<p>The cooperation between the production company winner of the Emmy Award and the Las Vegas TV station will clear the pilot episode of BEAT THE ODDS series across selected owned and operated stations to reach almost a quarter of all US television households.</p>
<p>“BEAT THE ODDS is a different type of sports betting show. It will give sports bettors top-notch analysis and information, but it’ll also be very entertaining, with features on sports history and how sports influence culture. It’s why we developed the show – to create a format that really engages sports and betting fans.” Cary Glotzer, CEO, Tupelo Honey</p>
<p>The pilot will feature nationally syndicated Full Court Press host Greta Van Susteren and her interview with Pro Football Hall of Famer and Super Bowl champion Brett Favre, with veteran KVVU news anchor Dave Hall serving as a host and joined in the studio by expert handicappers Jack Ross and Ted Sevransky, as well as Super Bowl champion, Brandon Marshall.</p>
<p>A leading sports analyst for 20 years and a regular contributor on SIRIUS XM, Ross’ national weekly radio show “The Fat Jack Sports Hour” airs on stations across the US, while “Teddy Covers” Sevransky is a professional sports bettor and radio and TV analyst featuring on WagerTalk.</p>
<p>Production Scheduled for Q3 2022</p>
<p>Following the pilot, Tupelo Honey plans to begin the production of the 30-minute series, a mixture of news, data, and analysis with sports history, in the third quarter of 2022. The production company that produces more than 800 live sports and entertainment shows per year added the new sports betting series that would be available for syndication.</p>
<p>“BEAT THE ODDS combines and showcases two of the most popular aspects of sports for the public, betting analysis and compelling storytelling. And we’re excited that the program will be produced in Las Vegas and on a new set in the market’s favorite local station.” Michael Korr, Vice President and General Manager, KVVU</p>
<p>Aimed at sports bettors and general sports fans at all levels, BEAT THE ODDS will bring expert opinions from popular analysts against the background of sports history features and information related to memorable wins and upsets, bad beats, and stories of people succeeding in taking risks, presented by former and current athletes, pop stars and celebrities, historians and analysts who have managed to find their way and beat the odds. The new sports betting show will have Michael Korr and Cary Glotzer serving as executive producers.</p>
