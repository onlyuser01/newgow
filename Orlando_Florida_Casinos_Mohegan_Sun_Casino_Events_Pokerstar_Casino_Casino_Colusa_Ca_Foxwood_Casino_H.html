    <h1>Orlando Florida Casinos Mohegan Sun Casino Events Pokerstar Casino Casino Colusa Ca Foxwood Casino H</h1>

<p>My name is ran drori</p>
<p>I leave in Canada on Friday I have made. Deposit if 1800$ to cryptoleo played throw till I hit 1300$ I tried to buy a bonus on a slot machine and it wouldn’t let me it said there is a bonus issue so I went in to the bonus page which the bonus that I have received in the amount of 2.75$ and cancelled it that way I could keep on playing WITH MY OWN MONEY so as soon as I cancelled the bonus all my funds disappeared I have contacted the support team but they were so rude and unhelpful so I wrote to the Curacao gambling commission for help. That was a scam on there site</p>
<p>another issue that I had is that I deposited 1200$ in to the account played throw a couple of hundred dollars and I saw that I am loosing so I wanted to withdraw the funds all of a sudden I get an email back saying to me that I can’t withdraw my money cause I haven’t played throw the whole funds and it’s like I am doing money laundering that pissed me off cause then I lost all of my funds</p>
<p>please help me get the word out that way other people won’t get scammed by this big shot cooperations won’t take Advantage of the "small people"</p>
<p>best regards</p>
<p>ran d***</p>
