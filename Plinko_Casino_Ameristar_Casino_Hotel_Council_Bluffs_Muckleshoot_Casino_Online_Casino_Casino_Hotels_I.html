<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and Mindway AI, a provider of advanced technological solutions tailored towards responsible gambling and safe play, have teamed up to further enhance the NCPG’s efforts in protecting consumers across the board. To this end, Mindway AI’s is integrating its flagship Gamalyze tool with the NCPG’s ResponisblePlay.org website dedicated to informing consumers on the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>The NCPG has hailed this team-up as a significant step forward for both companies. The innovative tool provided by Mindway AI will allow individuals who want to better understand their own gambling habits to take a closer look at their current level and frequency of play and get feedback on whether they align with responsible play guidelines and principles.</p>
<p>This partnership is important as it allows the two companies to combine several factors and expertise in bringing around actionable insight that does not feel intrusive. Rather, it’s down to consumers to leverage the two companies’ human expertise, AI and data-driven insights, and ultimately – seamless UI of the Gamalyze solution to get a better idea about their own habits and how they can do a little better when playing games of chance in terms of safety.</p>
<p>NCPG is happy to collaborate with Mindway AI as it also wants to leverage more actionable and engaging insights, the organization said in a press release. The opportunity was equally welcomed by Mindway AI Rasmus Kjaergaard who said that this new partnership allows Mindway AI to cover the entirety of the United States.</p>
<p>"This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to innovation in responsible gambling and our shared vision of creating a brighter future," Kjaergaard said, confident about the future of the collaboration. The partnership was naturally welcomed by NCPG Executive Director Keith S. Whyte who argued that education is pivotal in ensuring that players steer clear from gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>"The integration of Gamalyze into ResponsiblePlay.org will empower visitors with an innovative tool to help them make well-informed choices about their gambling behavior," Whyte added. Mindway AI recently embarked on a similar partnership in Europe where it teamed up with the German Sports Betting Association in a bid to also boost awareness for responsible gambling.</p>
