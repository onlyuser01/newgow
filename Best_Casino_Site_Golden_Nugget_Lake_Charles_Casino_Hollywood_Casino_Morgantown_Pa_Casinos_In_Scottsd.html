<p>Rafael Leao Doubtful for Leg 1 of the UCL Semifinal</p>
<p>One of AC Milanâ€™s best players, Rafael Leao, picked up an injury in the 11th minute of the game with Lazio. Despite that, his teammates managed to beat Lazio 2-0.</p>
<p>Leao injured his right adductor and is doubtful for the clash with Inter Milan, although there are some rumors that he could come back. Still, even if he does return, we probably wonâ€™t see him start the game. But he could come on the pitch later in the game, especially if his team isnâ€™t doing great up to that point.</p>

<p>The good news for the Rossoneri is that is pretty much the only important player whoâ€™s struggling with fitness. All the others are in top shape and have been playing great soccer over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>In fact, this team is undefeated since March 18 when they lost to Udinese in the Italian Serie A. Still, thereâ€™s a caveat â€“ most of their recent games finished in a draw.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Playing Fantastic Soccer</p>
<p>The Nerazzuri are 5-0-0 in their last five games in all competitions. The most impressive fact is that they played some real tough opponents in those games. For instance, they defeated Juventus 1-0 in the Italian Cup on April 26. Then, in their last game of April, they beat Lazio 3-1 in Serie A.</p>
<p>So far in May, theyâ€™ve won two games in the Italian league. First, they demolished Verona 6-0. Then, they beat AS Roma 2-0 on the road.</p>
<p>Another thing giving them confidence that theyâ€™re going to do great on Wednesday is that they have a very good record in duels with their city rivals, especially in recent times. They won three of the previous four games of the Derby Della Madonnina.</p>
<p>AC Milan vs Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Considering that this is Leg 1 of the Champions League semifinal, weâ€™ll probably see these two teams take a more cautious approach. That said, we wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the game saw under three goals in total. In fact, we wouldnâ€™t be shocked if it ended in a goalless draw.</p>
<p>Pick: AC Milan and Inter Milan to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
