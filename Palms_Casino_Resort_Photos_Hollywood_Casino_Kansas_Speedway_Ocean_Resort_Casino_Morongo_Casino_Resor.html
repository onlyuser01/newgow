In his new position as CCO for the US, Pugh will be responsible for the Danish company’s US-based subsidiaries and operations.</p>
<p>Pugh, “Happy” to Start the New Position as CCO</p>
<p>Pugh shared the good news on his social media, expressing his happiness for “starting a new position as chief commercial officer, Better Collective USA at Better Collective.” As previously mentioned, at the beginning of the year, Pugh stepped into the shoes of Better Collective’s vice president of business development and mergers and acquisitions. Before that, he was the company’s senior director of business development and mergers and acquisitions, a position he managed from the company’s headquarters in England, Stoke-on-Trent. Between July 2020 and June 2021, he was director of business development and mergers and acquisitions in the same location. Between October 2019 and July 2020, he was director of business development. He first joined Better Collective as head of business development in the UK in March 2019.</p>
<p>Pugh has also been the director of Responsible Affiliates in Gambling (RAIG) since May 2019. For seven years and seven months, he also fulfilled a number of positions with bet365. The list includes marketing operations manager between March 2014 and January 2019 and affiliate operations manager between May 2013 and March 2014. Before that, Pugh spent more than two years as a trainee solicitor for the Cheshire East Borough Council.</p>
<p>Pugh to Supervise a Number of US-Oriented Subsidiaries</p>
<p>Better Collective’s new CCO for USA will be responsible for the company’s US-oriented subsidiaries and operations and subsidiaries, including The Action Network, VegasInsider, Rotogrinders, ScoresAndOdds, and SportsHandle.</p>
<p>The company that was founded in 2004 is determined to be a worldwide leading sports betting media group. Its mission is to transform sports entertainment into something even more engaging using a number of sports media platforms that provide fresh tips, data, and information.
