<p>Gordon Ramsay’s name as a celebrity master chef is sure to attract many interested Foxwoods Resort Casino guests to the new Hell’s Kitchen restaurant in Connecticut</p>
<p>This is the sixth restaurant across the US in Ramsay’s kitchen empire, and it’s expected on the property this summer. It will be situated in the casino’s Grand Pequot Concourse and promises Ramsay’s dining experience and signature dishes.</p>
<p>Gordon Ramsay’s First Restaurant in New England</p>
<p>The restaurant will be able to seat almost 260 guests, with 40 seats in a private dining room as well as a chef’s counter. A stage was set up near the Rainmaker Expo Center at Foxwoods, with Ramsay shouting his “The wonder of it all” slogan while being shown on two large screens on either side of the stage. He also promised his signature Beef Wellington dish.</p>
<p>Foxwoods promised a collaboration with an unnamed celebrity chef last year, during its 30th anniversary. Now, at a belated 31-year celebration, the casino’s president and chief executive officer Jason Guyot announced it was Gordon Ramsay. “He’s the biggest chef in the world,” Guyot said, although Ramsay didn’t attend in the flesh.</p>
<p>“As the leading resort casino destination in the northeast, we are always looking for new and unique ways to elevate our guests’ experience,” added Guyot, sharing his vision for this partnership. He also sees this as another Foxwoods trait that sets it apart from other establishments as a premium travel destination.</p>
<p>Ramsay was equally ecstatic about the opportunity to launch another Hell’s Kitchen restaurant.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to bring Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen to Foxwoods Resorts Casino in the heart of New England. Gordon Ramsay</p>
<p>The expectations were set high, as is customary for anything related to Ramsay, with a combination of sophistication and upscale comfort with the energy of a busy kitchen.</p>
<p>Foxwoods Keeping Busy amid Changing Market</p>
<p>Ramsay’s restaurant adds to the list of celebrity-related culinary options in Foxwoods. The tribal resort also houses the David Burke Prime steakhouse and Guy Fieri’s Foxwoods Kitchen + Bar, so Ramsay’s addition falls in place nicely. Some have commented, however, that this new addition is also somewhat borne out of necessity amid the changing gambling landscape across the US.</p>
<p>As the US gambling scene keeps expanding, including in neighboring New York, Rhode Island, and recently Massachusetts, revenue has started being more evenly distributed. Connecticut’s slot machine revenue, for example, and Foxwoods’ in particular, has felt a negative impact on their bottom lines. Hence, gambling offerings in and of themselves are not enough for attracting customers anymore.</p>
<p>As such, Foxwoods has been busy since its 30th anniversary. It launched a new 30,000-square-foot, High Stakes Bingo Hall with 2,200 seats in July 2022. This is what gave birth to the 75,000-square-foot Rainmaker Expo Center. A new gaming area is also planned for late summer, which shares the resort’s $85 million investment with Ramsay’s restaurant.</p>
