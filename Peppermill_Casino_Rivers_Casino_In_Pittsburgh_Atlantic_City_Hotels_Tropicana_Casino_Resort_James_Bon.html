<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming announced that its Fanatics Sportsbook and Casino brand is finally live in Pennsylvania. Former PointsBet customers will be automatically migrated to the new platform.</p>
<p>As per the local rules, the operator will first undergo a two-day soft launch period under the supervision of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. However, Fanatics explained that this period will include no restrictions regarding customer registrations or playtime.</p>
<p>Players in Pennsylvania can now download the Fanatics Sportsbook on their mobile devices. The app combines sports betting and casino, allowing all kinds of players to enjoy the operator’s products.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is notably the eleventh state in which the Fanatics Sportsbook is available. It is also the second state for Fanatics Casino.</p>
<p>Fanatics acquired PointsBet’s business last year, facilitating its launch in The Keystone State. PointsBet customers in Pennsylvania will have their accounts automatically migrated to the new Fanatics Sportsbook platform, allowing them to retain their usernames, passwords, account balance, rewards points and responsible gaming settings.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Fans Should Brace for a Plethora of Content</p>
<p>Fanatics will provide players in Pennsylvania with a variety of engaging features. Sports betting fans, for example, can benefit from Fanatics Sportsbook’s FanCash feature that gives customers up to 5% of their bet back in FanCash they can spend on bonus bets or at fanatics.com. In addition, players can earn 5% FanCash on same-game parlay bets, 3% FanCash on parlay bets and 1% FanCash on straight bets and odds boosts.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fanatics Sportsbook Discover page features marquee games, trending bets, promos and personalized rewards. In the future, Fanatics plans to further personalize the Discover page to customers’ favorite teams, sports and markets. The Fanatics Sportsbook also offers a robust search engine that players can use to find exactly what they want.</p>
<p>Finally, sports betting fans can watch BetVision, an unparalleled sports betting product launched in partnership with Genius Sports. Players can use BetVision to place bets while watching certain football games directly in the Fanatics app.</p>
<p>A Variety of Games Awaits iGaming Enthusiasts</p>
<p>In the meantime, online casino fans will be able to enjoy a variety of online slots and table games which will be further enhanced by a variety of features. These include a world-leading selection of live casino games and a variety of top-performing slot games from best-in-class providers.</p>
<p>In addition, fans can earn FanCash back on bets, spins and hands and redeem loyalty points to purchase merchandise or get bonus bets. Fans can earn 0.2% FanCash on slots and 0.05% FanCash on table games.</p>
<p>Players in Pennsylvania will also be able to experience the new Fanatics Blackjack game developed in partnership with Boom Entertainment, as well as a variety of other games scheduled for later this year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, players will also be able to leverage a variety of responsible gaming features to keep on playing safely.</p>
