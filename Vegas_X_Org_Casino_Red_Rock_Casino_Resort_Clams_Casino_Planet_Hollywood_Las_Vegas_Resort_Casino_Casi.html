<p>After being postponed for two years due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Arizona State Poker Championship will return this July.</p>
<p>The Arizona State Poker Championship Will Run Through July 8-12</p>
<p>The 16th state poker tournament will return to the Talking Stick Resort in Scottsdale. Resuming after two years of postponement due to the pandemic, the Arizona State Poker Championship is planned to launch on July 8 and run through July 12. The event will take place at the Talking Stick Arena Poker Room. The overall prize pool of the prestigious tournament is expected to be more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Sign-ups for the tournament already started on May 28. The buy-in for the tournament is set at $1,100, which also includes a $100 service fee. The buy-in grants the poker players $16,000 in tournament chips. However, additional $10,000 bonus chips can be purchased for an extra $30.</p>
<p>It’s important to mention that the bonus chips can only be purchased before the players have received their first hand. On the other hand, re-entries to the Arizona State Poker Championship, as well as late entries will be allowed until the end of the first break on all-day ones.</p>

Then the semi-finals are going to take place on June 11, starting at 9 AM once again, while the finals are planned for July 12 with 10 AM as starting time. Besides a monetary prize, the tournament will award the top players a trophy.</p>
