    <h1>Casino Extream Casino Utan Svensk Licens Rivers Casino Portsmouth Virginia Twin Pines Casino Ramada</h1>

<p>Dear Polat87,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent request for a self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in that request for how long you wish your account to be suspended and the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"To self-exclude means to stop betting or gambling for a set time. Self-exclusion can be temporary or permanent.</p>
<p>By requesting one of our self-exclusion time periods on offer you agree to the following terms and conditions, which will be effective from the minute you receive a confirmation email of your chosen self-exclusion, this email will be sent to the email address used to register your account only and will display the date of self-exclusion completion.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>On receipt of an email request for account closure, the requested account and any linked accounts will be placed on our first stage, 24-hr cooling off period which will disable your account or accounts, allowing no gambling activity. Once this time has passed; while your account or accounts remain closed, a customer support agent will inform you of the 1-week, 1-month, 6- months and permanent self-exclusions available. There will be no variation of these time periods. To proceed with this process, we will require an email response. If we do not receive a response within a further 24 - hrs, your account will be reopened and confirmed by email.</p>
<p>If after reviewing our self-exclusion options you decide you would like to proceed with a permanent self-exclusion, you will be required to set an exclusion period when prompted. On occasion, we might decide to place an account on a short self-exclusion period if we believe it to be needed and or beneficial to the customer. This will be communicated by email; the above terms and conditions will apply.</p>
<p>When you request, or we deem it necessary, to add a self-exclusion, all remaining funds left in your account will be returned to you manually.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Once a self-exclusion is applied to your account, it will stay in place until the request time has finished, it will not be reversed or decreased for any reason. Permanent self-exclusions will remain closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>We will use all reasonable endeavors to ensure compliance with our responsible gambling self- exclusion policy. However,you accept that we will not be held responsible or liable if you attempt to open any new account or indeed succeed. In addition, we will not be held liable or accountable if you continue to deposit and wager using additional accounts which have previously not been disclosed. Any future wagers, Reward funds and entries in any promotions during a requested self-exclusion time will be forfeited, resulting in no return of stakes or payment of winnings. We will not be able to reinstate these if the account is reopened after the self-exclusion period. After self-exclusion you acknowledge that:</p>
<p>You should not attempt to, deposit or place any wager on any of your accounts from which you have requested to be excluded during your selected self-exclusion.</p>
<p>You should not attempt or proceed to open any new accounts during your self-exclusion period, or indefinitely if a permanent self-exclusion has been selected."</p>
<p>Is this support@stake.com the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
