    <h1>Foxwood Resort Casino Casino Rama Lucky Ducky Casino Hotels And Casinos In Las Vegas The Strat Hotel</h1>

<p>Hi this is Jessica S***, you helped me with my boyfriends complaint at Grand Rush casino. I myself decided to try a new online casino called Hustles Casino. I wanted to play a variety of different games. I deposited $45 of my own money thru bitcoins. I always have a limit to win when I play new casinos. This one I set myself at $200. I reached that limit plus some extra. I made my withdraw of the $200 and left the remaining amount to play. I was requested to send my identity and address verification in which i complied. I did have an issue with the electric bill request. The electric is in my landlords name and is included in my rent. So I sent some other mail in. They returned with a request sa t of a copy of lease. I sent that in also. I recieved an email back asking why the copy was altered and not signed. I had sent the signed portion in with the 9 page lease which included a cover letter. The landlord had covered the word business with residential. I stated I didnt know why he d oil d and offered them his number. They actually wanted the number and said the legal team would be contact with ng him to ask why he altered the page. I told them that this is extremely embarrassing but I do want my $200 so i gave them the number. Then they requested a notemraized identity verification. In turns I was extremely irritated and I said that I need them to send me the form they wanted notarized and a list of any other documentation. I stated that I was not going to turn in what I thought correct for them to tell me it's not right. As expected I recieved no response. Well I'm not waiting for them to send the form I did it my self from the internet. Along with an affidavit of residence. I went today got it a done and sent it all in. Within 30 mins they responded with I needed to get a statement from the notary stating I used the same ID that I sent to them to get the paper done. Which is compete bullshit. Especially when I asked them to send what they needed the night before. On top of that they want her contact information so that they can call her. I'm going to have to do it but I'm only giving her work email and i wi have he rdd forward any correspondence between them. Wa which is highly unfair to her because it's not her job to have to communicate with them. She did hers she notarized my papers. I feel like this is far from legal and also way past the point of personal privacy. They will not even let me have a contact number or email for the "legal team". But they want everybody i know contact information and even dont know. Please help me again. You are the only ones i know who will care. Its beyond the money with these casinos it now the principals that they take advantage of there "terms and conditions". I'm sending a file with all the correspondence with them so far. If you dont have time I completely understand. But thank you for the time you have already given.</p>
