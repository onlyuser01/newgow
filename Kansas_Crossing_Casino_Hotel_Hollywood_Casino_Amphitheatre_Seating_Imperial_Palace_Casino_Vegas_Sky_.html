<p>Australian gambling and entertainment company, The Star Entertainment Group, announced a senior leadership appointment. On Monday, the company said it appointed Zhan Spalding to the newly created role of General Manager Surveillance Queensland.</p>
<p>Spalding brings more than 30 years of experience in the security and surveillance industry. She was a part of national and international gaming venues. In her new role as General Manager Surveillance Queensland, Spalding will oversee the company's two Queensland properties.</p>
<p>The Star explained that Spalding "will be a key part of the transition from the Treasury Brisbane surveillance team to a new model in preparation for operations commencing at the Queen's Wharf Brisbane precinct with a planned staged opening in the second half of 2023."</p>
<p>What's more, the company revealed that Spalding will oversee the existing surveillance operating model implemented at The Star Gold Coast. This move complements The Star's masterplan expansion which has a price tag of $2 billion.</p>
<p>Besides strengthening the company's senior leadership team, the new appointment complements another strategy of the company. Having Spalding join the senior leadership team, The Star reaffirms its commitment to gender equality.</p>
<p>In a statement released on September 5, 2022, The Star Entertainment Group's Interim CEO and MD, Geoff Hogg, said: "Zhan's wealth of experience will be an asset to our Queensland-based surveillance and security team, particularly to a role and industry sector where women have traditionally been under-represented."</p>
<p>He explained that diversity of ideas and backgrounds play an important role in the company's strategy. At the same time, Hogg pointed out that it is exciting to see the success of The Star's gender equality and diversity strategy. In conclusion, he added: "We ensure the best people are recruited for the right roles, adhering to a policy that provides everyone with the same opportunities reduces bias in the hiring process and fosters an inclusive workplace."</p>
<p>Jess Mellor, The Star Gold Coast's Chief Operating Officer, added that it is thrilling to attract an industry professional like Spalding. Moreover, she acknowledged that Spalding has significant experience in implementing surveillance technology, as well as multi-site management.</p>
<p>Mellor pointed out: "Her appointment underpins The Star's growth and investment in Queensland as well as bolstering our female leadership ranks." She outlined that the company has a target to have 45% female and 45% male representation in senior leadership roles. The remaining 10% needs to be filled by non-binary gender identities, explains Mellor.</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement Spalding said that in her professional career, she was often the only woman a part of surveillance or security network teams. However, she said that she wants to encourage other women into pursuing such career opportunities in the industry. Last but not least, Spalding said: "I am thrilled to join The Star at this exciting stage of their expansion, and hope to help progress its cultural and diversity focus and achievements."</p>
