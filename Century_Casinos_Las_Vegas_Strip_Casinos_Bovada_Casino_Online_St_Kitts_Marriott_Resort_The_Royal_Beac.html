    <h1>Century Casinos Las Vegas Strip Casinos Bovada Casino Online St Kitts Marriott Resort The Royal Beac</h1>

<p>so i took the first deposit bonus at happy hugo for the first time on 08/18 where finally there was again a pleasant profit of around 1200 in any case i then applied for the payout of 1000 euros as far as no problem i got from the system via popup that i in the I'm about to cancel the bonus of 20 euros, still no problem, then I continued to dabble and I d√∂ssbattel then in the course of the battle, without thinking twice, I played a forbidden game a few rounds, at some point I had 500 in the active account and I still have the 1000 waiting I then thought oh before I gamble it away again pay 400 again so leave the game zack there was 1500 euros on my active account and zack 20 received an email that i violated the bonus conditions with the following excerpt from the bonus conditions ....</p>
<p>When playing with a bonus you can make a one-time withdrawal request (which will void the current bonus). The remaining balance will be treated as a win generated by your bonus and the bonus terms and conditions will still apply.</p>
<p>I then politely contacted the casino chat and wrote that I accept that I violated the bonus and that I also accept that the money will be deleted from my active account, but and that's how I understand it in the section I didn't get any answers either Written so that we are all happy I would also accept that you keep 25 percent of the money that was in the payment I didn't get any answers then nothing got really obtrusive <em>which I'm sorry by now ..but it doesn't matter here </em>I have but also no one insulted or similar yes meanwhile my account is blocked please please please dear team help me</p>
