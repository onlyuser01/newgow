<p>The leading online sports betting and gaming company, Meridianbet, announced it continues to expand its footprint in Europe thanks to a new sponsorship agreement. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it forged a new sponsorship deal with the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG). Under the terms of the new collaboration, Meridianbet was designated as the FA's official sponsor.</p>
<p>The recent sponsorship agreement, which represents a major boost for Montenegrin football, was signed by Jovana Klisić, Meridianbet Montenegro's Executive Director, as well as Dejan Savićević, the FA's President and famous soccer player. The freshly minted deal was signed in the House of Football, designating Meridianbet as the sponsor of the FSCG through the end of 2024. The latest collaboration also reaffirms the company's expansion in the country after last year it agreed to sponsor the First Montenegrin Football League.</p>
<p>Per the new sponsorship agreement, Meridianbet will benefit from brand exposure via all of the FA's official competitions. This will include not only national teams but domestic leagues as well. The gaming and betting company will also play a key role in the development of different youth programs and sports infrastructures. Collaborating together, the duo will seek to help expand the reach and popularity of Montenegrin soccer.</p>
<p>In a statement, Klisić shared her excitement about the collaboration with Meridianbet. "The signing of this contract marks a major leap forward, paving the way for a prosperous partnership," she said. Additionally, Klisić pointed out: "As a company recognized as a leader in sports betting and gaming throughout the Southeast Europe, this sponsorship will massively improve the quality of Montenegrin football as well as our reputation for being the region’s top sports sponsor."</p>
<p>Last but not least, Meridianbet Montenegro's Executive Director said that a key goal of the collaboration with the FA is to help fuel Montenegrin soccer's growth and establish a foundation for future collaborations.</p>
<p>Savićević was excited about the freshly minted sponsorship deal as well. He pointed out: "We are immensely honored to have the support of Meridianbet, a company with regional and international credibility." Additionally, Savićević said: "We are glad that Meridianbet recognized the mutual benefits of this partnership, which we look forward to taking to even greater heights."</p>
<p>According to the President of the FA of Montenegro, the timing of the recent partnership is perfect, given the upcoming period for the "brave falcons." Finally, he predicted that the collaboration will bring value to the FA and the falcons for years to come.</p>
