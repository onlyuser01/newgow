    <h1>Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Tampa Casino Ballroom Hampton Nh Sycuan Casino Resort Green Valley Ranc</h1>

<p>Dear Frank,</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear, that you believe, I’m taking anybody’s side. Our forum is trying to be as independent as possible and we always try our best when resolving a case. In my point of vue, the proof which has been provided to us by the casino, was satisfactory. I have no other options or possibilities to investigate, only to request and collect evidences.</p>
<p>If you still wish to continue with this case, I would recommend you, to contact Curaçao eGaming (the Licensing Authority). Please be advised: „Curaçao eGaming should only be contacted by players when they believe an Operator is in breach of their license. All disputes with an Operator about a payout, a blocked account, a delay, broken features and so on, should first be taken up directly with the Operator. If no resolution is found there are number of independent bodies you can contact, which should be listed on the Operator website. If, however, the complaint relates to an Operator breaching their license, you can contact Curaçao eGaming directly via their Player Support channel or via the "File a complaint" button below. You must include all the details of your grievance so they can investigate fully. All disputes must be recorded in writing via email so the complaint is correctly recorded."</p>
<p>In order to proceed with contacting the Licensing Authority, please use the link below or please click on the license validator/seal on the casino’s website and "File a complaint" directly.</p>
<p>"https://f584444c-9674-4199-90bf-0d4a90d52596.curacao-egaming.com/sealassets/f9184b2f8f353364da5ab46c99fec317-casinoextreme.eu-4f717bb3f1e93a256a15e554d5513e9c2157f726e5197ca8b7c429c05ace46378f762d71e3e24f41f07435b41ff5a491-c2VhbC5wbmc%3D?status=valid"</p>
<p>If you wish to close this complaint, I will honor your request, but if you allow me, I’d like to keep it opened for a month and wait for you to keep me posted about the outcome from the Curaçao eGaming. I am sorry I couldn’t help you more with this case. Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
