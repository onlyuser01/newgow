    <h1>Casino Tattoo Free Online Casino Games Win Real Money No Deposit Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Reso</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need your help regarding my Duxcasino Account.Today on 21/06/2023 got 20 no deposit free spins from Duxcasino for my birthday on slot Named Birthday.</p>
<p>I won usd 2.16 from those 20 no deposit free spins, wagering requirement for the free spins win was usd 64.08.</p>
<p>I completed the wagering for the 20 no deposit free spins and I got a pop up on my account informing me that wagering is complete and I also checked the bonus tab and there also it was showing that the wagering was completed.</p>
<p>I requested withdrawal for usd 30 since I had completed the wagering for the 20 no deposit free spins bonus I got today, but Dux casino rejected my withdrawal request and told me that I still needed to wager usd 120 for the three deposits I made of usd 20 each totalling usd 60 on my account till date that I have already lost all the deposits I made few months ago.They told me I have to wager my total deposit usd 60 3 times and they gave me the usd 120 as the amount still needed to wager.</p>
<p>I asked them why I need to wager the deposits that I made months ago which I had already lost and didn't even win anything or cashed out from the deposits that I made, they told me I have to do it to avoid money laundering.That is ridiculous all the usd 60 that I deposited I have lost so why would I wager my deposits that I lost!?</p>
<p>They forced me to wager another usd 120 for my deposits that I made.I wagered the remaining usd 120 and then I talked to their chat support , chat agent confirmed that my withdrawal should be processed now since I completed the remaining wagering of usd 120.After I wagered the required usd 120 I had usd 50.17 on my account.</p>
<p>I requested withdrawal of usd 50 .This was third time I requested withdrawal, after talking to their chat support and getting the confirmation.</p>
<p>Again my withdrawal request was rejected by their finance email support for the third time and again they told me I had to wager usd 120.</p>
<p>I emailed them with screenshots of proof that shows that I had already wagered the required amount.</p>
<p>Please help me with the withdrawal they are trying to scam me.I have done everything they told me but still they don't process my withdrawal.</p>
<p>I am unable to attach any screenshots your system is not letting me upload any attachments getting red error message Attachment upload has failed.</p>
<p>I have all the proof in screenshots I can send it to you email please.</p>
<p>I can</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Rocky</p>
