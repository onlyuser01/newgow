The website offers other bonuses and perks along the way, including a Refer a Friend Program and Rewards Points Loyalty Program.</p>
<p>Betting Markets &amp; Odds</p>
<p>The value of Bovada’s online sports betting odds is where the website truly shines. Bovada’s trading team is one of the best, with constant updates and a lot of action going on on the website.

<ol>
<li>MyBookie.ag</li>
</ol>
<p>MyBookie is another fairly new sportsbook licensed in Curacao and set up in 2014. Since it was launched, the offshore sportsbook has come a long way, consistently improving its odds over the years. While there are clearly some things to be improved upon, MyBookie is a good point of reference when it comes to odds.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has a quick pricing model that offers value betting opportunities along the way. We are not sure how well sharp bettors would enjoy this website, but recreational sports fans have few things to care about. As to the overall User Interface and Experience, MyBookie holds its end well, providing players with a swift and reliable platform.</p>
<p>Bonus Offer</p>
<p>MyBookie has a good way to get you started. The initial deposit bonus is 50% up to $1,000, which is a great sign-up bonus all in all. There is a 10x rollover requirement that makes things fairly easy although we have to admit – there are some welcome bonuses that are much quicker and simpler. The only thing we really don’t like about the offer is the use of “free play” for the bonus money, as you need to deposit it in order to trigger the bonus amount. It’s not exactly free.</p>
<p>Still, we think the bonusing system is well-developed at MyBookie. It includes an 8% horse rebate, and 25% sports reload. There are also 200% referral bonuses, which are a great way to bring your friends over and get something out as well. All in all, the promotions found here are among the best of all offshore sports betting sites.</p>
<p>Betting Markets &amp; Odds</p>
<p>MyBookie does a good job of keeping the odds list together. The website offers a good variety of parlays, teasers, and straight bets, contributing to a strong overall variety of options you can take. The odds coefficients can be indeed improved upon, but in terms of the pure variety of betting markets available, MyBookie does well.</p>
<p>A good thing about the pricing model here is that MyBookie clearly puts a lot of effort into making sure that it covers a variety of events and does so with equal interest in big and small sports, providing niche-seekers with the opportunity to connect with their favorite sports right on the spot. The sportsbook covers both traditional sports as well as some of the more unorthodox markets, such as politics and financial betting.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>MyBookie takes pride in the fact that whenever you need help with your online sports betting, the team will be there for you – 24/7. Sports bettors will get a fantastic treatment, with quick answers, and feedback. All you need to do is send an email through the contact form and look forward to a swift response. If you prefer, though, you can reach out via live chat as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>XBet</li>
</ol>
<p>XBet is another prominent offshore sportsbook in the online betting industry. The website is licensed by the Curacao eGaming Commission, and it was launched in 2014. The sportsbook is one of the most competitive you will find out there on the market, making for a great variety of odds, competitive markets, and wager types. All of this put together provides players with a solid variety of options to enjoy as they seek to optimize their next wager and place with the best odds possible. XBet sportsbook is available for both mobile and desktop devices, making it a fantastic experience from start to finish. Let’s take a closer look now.</p>
<p>Bonus Offer</p>
<p>The starter’s offer at XBet is definitely something that you need to look into. The offshore sportsbook bonus is $500 on your first deposit. This comes with a 7x rollover requirement, which is actually pretty decent. The matched rate you can claim the bonus at is 50%, and not the standard 100% for this type of bonus, but this is still okay, as the rate and clearance conditions are pretty good.</p>
<p>There are also other promotions you can explore at XBet to make your offshore sports betting experience even better. For example, you have the 7% horse rebate and a sports reload bonus of up to $250. These bonuses are quick and easy to use and claim, making for a smooth betting experience right from the start.</p>
<p>Betting Markets &amp; Odds</p>
<p>The sports betting markets at XBet are optimized to provide you with a decent variety of competitive odds, wager types, and sports. All three boxes are checked with the sportsbook which strives to always bring you some of the most satisfying outcomes no matter what sports you want to wager on.</p>
<p>There are tons of parlays, teasers, and straight bets to choose from with XBet, giving you a complete and wholesome variety of options to enjoy. The offshore sportsbook runs many sports-specific brackets and markets. Player proposition bets or player props as they are known to the public are also very popular with this sportsbook, making for a fun experience from start to finish.</p>
<p>There is usually anything between 50-100 props per game, which is actually quite neat. Spread, Moneyline and Total wagers usually tend to be in focus here for the most part, but you can look up more wagers under each game and match.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>XBet’s customer support is a great way to connect with the betting operator and have your queries answered. Players who are looking to find out more about the sportsbook would be able to fire up a live chat or call directly on a phone line. The support agents are there 24/7 and they will help you sort out any query you may have about the website.</p>
<p>How We Pick and Review Offshore Betting Sites</p>
<p>With so many great sportsbooks to go around, reviewing offshore sports betting sites may prove a little daunting at first glance. Thankfully, you don’t have to do any of the hard work as we have a dedicated team of industry experts with extensive understanding and insight into the industry.</p>
<p>As a result, we can bring you the best offshore sportsbooks and give you specific reasons why some simply outperform the rest. With a combined experience of over 60 years in the gambling industry, our experts take a look at several important aspects of the offshore gambling sites we bring to your attention.</p>
<p>Reputation and Public Opinion</p>
<p>Because the topic of offshore betting is always a little divisive, we have established over the years that for a sportsbook in this vertical to be successful, it would need to fulfill certain prerequisites. One of those is establishing a sterling reputation that makes sportsbooks a familiar and trusted partner in offshore gambling. To achieve this, every betting site will have to meet high consumer standards and expectations and offer an impeccable online sports betting experience. We thoroughly review public opinion and use it to create our own rankings.</p>
<p>Fairness of Odds and Lines</p>
<p>Because there is no central regulatory authority in most cases, offshore betting sites must live up to high standards of fairness and integrity. Offshore sportsbook odds must be competitive with the ones offered on the mainland. They are often even better to make such betting sites competitive. However, the best offshore sportsbooks pay smaller taxes, which allows them to adjust the odds and offer smaller vigorish fees, which makes it rather easy for them to establish a strong reputation and fair odds and lines. We make sure to double-check for these as we go along.</p>
<p>Security and Safety</p>
<p>Since offshore sportsbooks are not located in the country in most cases, US players and players from around the world are often wary of how safe a sportsbook is. As it turns out, they have some of the highest standards of safety and security. They ensure that all their pages are SSL encrypted, and often, they even call upon third-party auditors to verify the fairness of the odds and payouts. This is a crucial moment for offshore bookmakers to build up their reputation, and they strive to uphold draconian safety measures.</p>
<p>Offshore Betting Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>Just like anywhere else, offshore sportsbook bettors are keen to get their hands on a variety of promotions. Whether it’s a deposit bonus, a first deposit welcome bonus, risk-free wagers, or some other option, bonuses play a crucial role in sports bettors. While they are not the most important aspect of the sports gambling experience, bonuses still help us read whether a sportsbook means well to its players or is trying to take advantage of them. Top offshore betting sites have excellent promotions that involve a great welcome bonus and a generous risk-free wager that can be both used quickly and without any issues.</p>
<p>Sports Variety and Markets</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the online sports betting experience is the variety of markets. Bettors are keen to place a variety of sports bets that include money lines, totals, spreads, prop bets, and others. That is why we make sure to always check if an offshore sportsbook satisfies these expectations before recommending it. Sports variety is equally important to us, and we will look at whether all main sports have been covered, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, and many others. Variety is crucial to the success of online sports betting sites, and that is what we expect to find.</p>
<p>What Is Offshore Betting?</p>
<p>Offshore sportsbooks began appearing back in the 1990s when the hunger for quality sports betting action was high, and there were a few alternatives. Operators realized that they could set up shop at places such as Costa Rica and create online sportsbooks that service customers from around the world. As a result, sportsbooks began catering to a global audience, with bettors coming from North and South America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.</p>
<p>The status of ‘offshore’ has been challenged on several occasions, but to this date, the best offshore betting sites are up and running precisely because they do not break any specific laws. Essentially, an online sportsbook in Costa Rica serves as a betting shop that people visit. Instead of traveling to the venue, though, they can simply place their sports bets remotely.</p>
<p>For this matter, offshore sportsbooks are considered to be legitimate businesses, and offshore gambling is a fair choice for anyone who wants to set up an online betting account and get access to even more odds, markets, and betting opportunities.</p>
<p>Offshore betting is set up for entertainment purposes only, and sportsbooks based in the Isle of Man, Curacao, or Costa Rica still acknowledge and honor gambling laws in individual countries by focusing on jurisdictions that do not formally object to offshore sportsbook gambling.</p>
<p>Offshore vs. Regular Sports Betting Odds</p>
<p>As we briefly mentioned odds in our reviewing process, it’s time to take a slightly closer look at the betting lines and how they fare when we compare offshore betting sites with mainland ones. As explained earlier, offshore sportsbooks have slightly more favorable markets when it comes to odds. This is thanks to several reasons. For starters, unlike US sports betting sites, offshore bookmakers often have to pay a little less in terms of tax (or no tax at all).</p>
<p>That allows them to be more competitive when drafting up the lines and odds. Secondly, they have fewer actual regulatory objections to deal with. While college sports betting on the NCAAB or NCAAF may be the cause of some concern in some states, offshore bookmakers can make sure that they draft markets for those events without having to worry about anything. In terms of available markets, you are bound to have pretty much the same options as mentioned before.</p>
<p>You will have moneylines, but the vigorish at offshore sportsbooks will probably be smaller. So, instead of paying $110 to win $100, you may end up paying $105 to win $100. There are spreads, totals, and proposition bets all worth your while, as well as bets that are specific to sports such as baseball and hockey. Overall, the odds at offshore sports betting sites are spot on, and they provide you with a fair market where you can make use of betting over the Internet and extract the best possible value from your wagers.</p>
<p>Reasons to Bet at Offshore Sportsbooks</p>
<p>There are many distinct advantages why you would want to choose the top offshore online sportsbooks. These betting sites are built in a way that can cater to US players, but then again, they can cater to anyone else in the world. The welcome bonus at most such sites is universally good, and you can find great odds and sports, including horse racing, to really add to the joy of the experience. Here, we will list several reasons why we believe offshore sportsbooks bring so much to the table and why you would benefit from betting at any of them.</p>
<p>Competitive Odds</p>
<p>As mentioned before, offshore sportsbooks have one excellent advantage -competitive odds. The odds are often a bit better than mainstream bookmakers precisely because there is less red tape to get in the way. As a result, sports fans are able to benefit from competitive lines and fixtures that will add value to every possible bet you can make, whether you are betting on live events, pre-game, or future markets.</p>
<p>New Opportunities</p>
<p>Once again, offshore sportsbooks tend to excel when it comes to market variety. Online gambling makes it easy and quick to track a variety of sports that appeal not just to US players but also to the broader global betting crowd. As a result, markets such as NCAAB and NCAAF, and even esports, are thoroughly featured at offshore betting sites, which makes it very easy for you to have an entire plateau of betting choices at your beck and call. You can browse through any market you wish and place a wager that you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>Better Vigorish</p>
<p>Offshore sportsbooks come with better vigor. The vig is the fee that is charged on top of your every bet – that’s how a sportsbook makes its revenue. However, the vigorish at offshore betting sites is much better for a number of reasons. For starters, betting sites located outside of the mainland are subject to a much better tax regime, which allows them to be more generous when it comes to drafting lines and offering a competitive sports betting experience.</p>
<p>Remote Access</p>
<p>While local regulation may obstruct the introduction of intuitive sports betting options such as mobile betting, you can rest assured that offshore sports betting is focused on the consumer. As such, mobiles are ALWAYS an option offshore, and you will be able to access a betting site directly from your desktop computer or smartphone. All top offshore sportsbooks are available on mobile and can be bet on interactively from afar.</p>
<p>Quick Banking</p>
<p>A crucial component of any offshore sportsbook is its ability to deliver quick banking options. Your first deposit, whether it’s done with a credit card or e-wallet, should always clear quickly, and that is precisely what bookmakers do. You can enjoy instant banking that will provide you with the funds necessary to bet online on your favorite sports in no time. You can manage your deposits quickly and easily by using the right banking options.</p>
<p>Is Offshore Sports Gambling Legal?</p>
<p>Understandably, the legality of offshore betting and gambling as a whole is a recurring issue. The majority of sports bettors worry that there may be some legal reason not to access sports betting websites. For the most part, there is none. Unless a regulator has exclusively banned a website from accessing your area of living, you may rest assured that it’s technically legal for you to play an offshore sportsbook.</p>
<p>A popular example explains that offshore betting sites are like visiting these websites in places like Costa Rica or the Isle of Man. This is an imperfect way to put it, and these websites are “a grey area” at best. However, they are not to YOU as a sports bettor. You can access your account, enjoy tons of selections and claim various bonuses free of worry that you have any responsibility to carry.</p>
<p>The onus is on sportsbooks to make sure that their offers are compliant with local regulations. Naturally, you should pay attention to whether a bookmaker has had any head-butting with local regulators as this may presage a ban for the website from your area. However, it’s safe to say that participating in sports gambling contests at offshore betting sites is completely legal from the standpoint of someone who places wagers.</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
