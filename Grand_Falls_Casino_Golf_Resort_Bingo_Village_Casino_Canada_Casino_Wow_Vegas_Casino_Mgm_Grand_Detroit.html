<p>As of March 1, real-money betting apps will be available on the Google Play Store in 15 new jurisdictions, including the United States.</p>
<p>Gambling and Betting Apps Will Soon Be Available in the U.S.</p>
<p>Google has announced on Thursday that U.S. residents may soon enjoy betting and gambling apps on the Google Play Store. Players can see a complete list on Google’s support page as to which gambling apps are allowed in each state. Different apps will be allowed in different states, according to each state’s legislature.</p>
<p>Online casino games will be allowed in Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and online poker will debut in Nevada.</p>
<p>Sports betting will be available in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and West Virginia. In the District of Columbia, Montana, and Oregon, only-state run operators will be eligible to apply for their gambling apps to be listed on the Play Store.</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports apps will be subject to existing regulation and laws in each jurisdiction, and specifically in the United States.</p>
<p>Lotteries will be available only by operators run by the state or affiliate operators in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia.</p>
<p>The following message can now be found on Google’s support page: “We allow real-money gambling apps, ads related to real-money gambling, and daily fantasy sports apps that meet certain requirements.”</p>
<p>There is a gambling application form for app makers, which requires them to comply with the country and state laws where the app is available. For each jurisdiction they operate in, they must have a valid gambling license. The apps will be rated as adults only and must prevent minors from using the app. The apps will also include information about responsible gambling. They must be free for download and not use Google Play in-app billing.</p>
<p>Gambling Apps on Google Play Will Be Available in 14 Other Countries</p>
<p>This new policy change by Google will take place in 15 other countries, including the US. As of March 1, Google Play will also make gambling and betting apps available at are the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, Romania, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Columbia, and Brazil.</p>
<p>App makers from these countries will also have to implement restrictions for minors. They must also deny access to their apps from other countries or regions that they do not have a license.</p>
<p>Developers will have to comply with strict rules and also have a valid operating license. They must be legal operators, approved by the government. The license that they provide must be for the type of gambling product that they offer in the specific country. The application for developers must fall into one of the categories: online casino games, sports betting, daily fantasy sports, or lotteries.</p>
<p>Google’s has had an on-again-off-again relationship with gambling. The company has previously suspended gambling apps but has not been happy with consumers side-downloading them either.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a solution that allows vulnerable consumers to limit their exposure to gambling and alcohol ads. Both Google and Apple have faced lawsuits over allegedly assisting apps to promote unregulated gambling in the past.</p>
<p>Just this week, Apple was cited as the defendant in a lawsuit in California alleging that the tech giant has allowed social casinos to accept money for virtual currency, which was a form of gambling and against the state laws.</p>
