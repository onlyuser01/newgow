<p>A lucky ticket-holder in Florida won the record-sized Mega Millions jackpot following the lottery’s drawing on Tuesday. The jackpot was able to survive for quite some time, surpassing $1 billion before finally, a lucky winner guessed all white balls and the gold Mega Ball on the 31st drawing from August 8, 2023. The lucky winner guessed correctly all white balls, 13, 19, 20, 32 and 33, as well as the gold Mega Ball, 14.</p>
<p>This enabled the lucky individual to hit the jackpot which is estimated at $1.58 billion or $783.3 million in cash. There was a single winning ticket for the mega jackpot, which is estimated to be a new record for the Mega Millions game. The latest jackpot is expected to surpass the previous $1.537 billion record set back in October 2018 by a lucky winner from South Carolina.</p>
