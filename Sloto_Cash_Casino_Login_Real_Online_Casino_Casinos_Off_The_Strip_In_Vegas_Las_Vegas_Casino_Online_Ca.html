<p>Gigantoonz review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Gigantoonz is the latest in the Play'NGo series that is themed around delightfully cute aliens. Other entries in the series include Dr Toonz and the two Reactoonz slots.</p>
<p>As with previous installments, players will enter the heart of a spaceship and meet a variety of colorful extraterrestrials. Each creature has a unique personality, and often an unusual number of eyes.</p>
<p>This slot is a great pick for players in the mood for a cheerful sci-fi theme and a whimsical atmosphere.</p>
<p>Big win in the Gigantoonz slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The upbeat soundtrack is filled with tinkling notes and occasional nonsense interjections from the aliens. Their voices are undeniably adorable and they add a lot of personality to the little extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>Each of the aliens is animated in a cartoon style in vivid hues of blue, pink, yellow, and green. Most smile cutely out at the player, showing off their unique features, such as tiny horns, or single eyeballs.</p>
<p>The Gargantoon alien, a much larger character, sits beside the reels with three eyes and a speckling of spots. He definitely seems a little fiercer than the tiny aliens on the reels.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a dreamy spacescape of drifting purple and blue galaxies and shooting stars. This helps confirm the game’s sci-fi theme and creates the sense of flying through space.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Gigantoonz combine for a lighthearted, sci-fi vibe.</p>
<p>Several Quantum Wilds can appear on a non-winning spin</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gigantoonz is an eight reel, eight row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins by landing at least 6 matching symbols in a cluster. These symbols must be connected horizontally and/or vertically.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that form winning clusters will vanish and new symbols will fall from above to take their place.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Quantum Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. Between 5 and 10 Quantum Wilds will be added to the reels at random during non-winning spins.</p>
<p>Gargantuan Wilds only appear via the Quantumeter beside the reels and also substitute for all symbols.</p>
<p>The Quantumeter charges through wins and provides bonuses at four designated charge levels which trigger in turn every 25 winning symbols collected. These bonuses include:</p>
<p>Removal of selected symbols (25 winning symbols)</p>
<p>Transformation of symbols (50 winning symbols)</p>
<p>Addition of Mega symbols (75 winning symbols)</p>
<p>Addition of Mega Gargantuan Wild symbols (max charge, 100 winning symbols)</p>
<p>Mega symbols take up a greater number of positions than regular symbols and can appear in sizes 2x2 to 7x7. For cluster wins, Mega symbols count as a single symbol, however, they have a randomized value that is used to calculate the prize given.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.25 %, above our yardstick for average RTP of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable for the top paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest the strategy of targeting the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility sci-fi-themed slot.</p>
<p>With decent RTP and strategy-ready volatility, Gigantoonz is a good find for mathematically-minded players.</p>
<p>The variety of bonus features add extra flavor to this engaging game.</p>
