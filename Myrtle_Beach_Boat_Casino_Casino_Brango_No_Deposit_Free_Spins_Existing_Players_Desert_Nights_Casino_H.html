    <h1>Myrtle Beach Boat Casino Casino Brango No Deposit Free Spins Existing Players Desert Nights Casino H</h1>

<p>casino.</p>
<p>Little bit of twist n turning regarding my situation. I'l point out facts actual event's that happened &amp; other in point form.</p>
<p>Claimed bonus AXE135 but I did not read the TC for this bonus.</p>
<p>Max cashout for bonus AUD $7500</p>
<p>$2500 per day cashout</p>
<p>Max per week $7500</p>
<p>I won some good coin &amp; once cleared wagering sent all the relevant verification ID documents particularly change of name certificate with the updated birth certificate &amp; proceeded making withdrawals</p>
<p>• I can't quite recall how this next turn of events the order of the 3rd withdrawal order the time of it but I know I submitted the first two withdrawals orders of $2500x2 =$5k</p>
<p>• won some more coin &amp; withdrew another two orders 2x$2500 =$10k &amp; some money left over.</p>
<p>• all withdrawal orders &amp; verification documents rejected &amp; only $5k returned in my account out the 10k submitted.</p>
<p>• enquie bout all of this &amp; find out $7.5k AUD is the the max cashout Fair enough didn't read TC. &amp; voided the other $2.5k for exceeding the max cashout. No worries just help yourself with my winnings. Pay me the 7.5k max cashout for that bonus &amp; the rest is still my money that I've won wagering has been met it's different if wagering hasn't been met compared to a max cashout if you're up 15k max cashout for bonus used is 10k then that's all your getting from that bonus play is 10k not 15k but that 5k should be still yours you've won that money &amp; you should continue with it in your account but I'll say more to this later in the piece, anyway $2.5k voided</p>
<p>• wheres the rest of my money you the casino owe me another$2.5k .$7.5k AUD is max cashout returned $5k only out of the $10k .</p>
<p>• returned the $2.5k to my account = $7.5k plus over $1.5k I was still playing with when this all happened.</p>
<p>• so ordered 3x$2.5k withdrawals again plus sorted verification issue wasted 4hrs &amp; the chance to process my first withdrawal payment. By explaining to him that I sent him all the relevant information n documents regarding the change of name &amp; that he kept rejecting 4 times plus explaining that he reads certificate properly. Anyway done my head in. Couldn't stop apologising in his emails.</p>
<p>• through out the weekend lost the $1.5k recalled $500 out of one of the $2.5k withdrawals later on recalling the rest of the $2k withdrawal.</p>
<p>• got up again ordered $2.5 withdrawal &amp; a further 10k I won.</p>
<p>• ordered submitted 4x$2.5 =$10k withdrawals early this morning got up to play some free spins from leveling up &amp; plus won a jackpot $71 log in after free spins finished there's $7.5k pop up in my account where's the other 10k that I won seperatly from the max cashout bonus amount. That was completed &amp; adjusted when they voided the first $2.5k .</p>
<p>Plus I had 3 withdrawals pending after they voided the $2.5k</p>
<p>Can you please look into this further with the casino &amp; the whole database activity surrounding all of this please &amp; let me know. I just want my money that I won clearly the $10k</p>
<p>If there's any breaches in exceeding max cashout amounts then they should the casino have something in place that clearly justifies this&amp; elimantes any further playing. Not 1-2 days later come in or whenever the next withdrawal has been submitted &amp; come out saying this n that &amp; voiding the players winnings money that they've truly calculated as it's their money from playing experiencing the thrills jubilation excitement feelings and emotions have been played with.</p>
<p>• the casino is saying the TC information is on their website further details regarding my situation.</p>
<p>I have gone over every single word in the website 3 times over &amp; I for the life of me can not find this information anywhere in the detail that reflects my situation.</p>
<p>I requested asked for them to please provide me with this particular extremely important information from 4 different personal &amp; they failed to do this. It's something that you guys can seek out either asking them the grounds that they are claiming &amp; where is stated in their T C against me.</p>
<p>My part in my stand that they owe me 10k that they voided from my legitimate play winnings is the bonus I claimed AXE135 max cashout withdrawal was $7.5k after bit of turbulence &amp; adjustments 7.5k was met &amp; accounted completing the bonus AXE135 right? I had 3x$2.5k pending withdrawals from Friday.</p>
<p>I continued on playing with money that was the leftovers after evening the max withdrawal amounts at $2.5k.</p>
<p>Mind you if the verification department didn't fumble the ball &amp; wasted 3-4 hrs trying to verify my account when I gave them all they needed I would've my first withdrawal payment sent.</p>
<p>I recalled twice on one of the withdrawal which later won me $10k but they voided all that $10k that &amp; rejected the 3x2.5k withdrawals from the $7.5k max cashout withdrawal from the bonus axe135 making me lose my spot in the queue for my first withdrawal I had already submitted last Friday by having to submit these 3x2.5k withdrawals today further delaying my withdrawal</p>
