<p>Denise Coates founded Bet365 in a portable office building at a Stoke City car park in January 2000. Now, seventeen years later, she’s pulling in the largest CEO salary in Great Britain, paying herself £217 million ($284.5 million) for fiscal year 2016-17.</p>

<p>Her annual take is more than four times than that of the previous compensation king Martin Sorrell, CEO of international advertising and PR giant WPP, who last year made £48.1million ($63 million), and more than 1,300 times that of the UK’s prime minister.</p>
<p>It is the equivalent of £769,000 ($1 million) a day based on a five-day workweek.</p>
<p>As co-CEO of one of the world’s largest online betting companies, the 50-year-old mother of five earned a base pay of £199.3 million ($261.3 million) and added £18 million ($23.6 million) in dividends. Her take-home pay grew significantly from the previous year, where she earned £117 million ($153.4 million).</p>
<p>Bet365 has seen record profits over the past year of £525 million ($688.3 million) from a record £47 billion ($61.6 billion) in bets.</p>
<p>Family Business</p>
<p>To put the figure in perspective, Coates made double the money of the entire payroll of the soccer team her company and family owns, the Stoke City Potters, a Premier League football club.</p>
<p>Coates owns Bet365 with her brother, John (his salary was not disclosed), who also serves as vice-chairman of Stoke City FC. She is the eldest daughter of Peter Coates, Stoke City’s chairman. Her husband, Richard, is also a director of the football club.</p>
<p>Gambling industry watchdog groups have criticized the amount of Coates’ compensation. The Fairer Gambling organization issued a statement after news spread about her salary, saying that it was too much considering that the country is in a problem gambling crisis.</p>
<p>“As losses from Britain’s gamblers continue to spiral out of control, so has executive pay,” the statement read. “The entire gambling industry donated just £8 million ($10.5 million) to research, education and treatment last year. If these companies can afford to pay their executives millions of pounds a year, there is no excuse for such chronically underfunded treatment services.”</p>
<p>High Pay Centre spokesman Stefan Stern told the Mirror that her salary is offensively excessive.</p>
<p>“In an industry like gambling, where people become trapped financially, it has to be concerning when the rewards at the top are so high,” Stern said. “There comes a moment where some pay packages are so high they become unseemly.”</p>
<p>Powerful Woman</p>
<p>Coates is notoriously publicity shy and gave no comments about her pay, which was released with typical disclosures for public companies. She last gave a formal interview in 2012.</p>
<p>But she did make a statement to address the country’s problem gambling issues in a statement released Monday.</p>
<p>“(We are) committed to developing an evidence-based approach to responsible gambling,” she said. “To this end, the group continues to work with research partners on a number of projects to improve its methods of identifying harmful play and deliver more effective harm-minimization interventions.”</p>
<p>Coates got her start at a cashier at her father’s betting shops and earned a degree in econometrics from Sheffield University and became manager of the family business when she was 22. In 2000, she convinced her family to borrow nearly $20 million against the business to start an online betting site.</p>
<p>She bought the domain name Bet365.com and around it built a company that has now grown into a multibillion-dollar empire.</p>
<p>In 2017, Forbes estimated her personal wealth at $4 billion, making her the 14th richest person in the UK.</p>
