<p>Taking a Step Towards Global Self-Exclusion Standards: The Journey Begins</p>
<p>Last updated: 29 May 2023 12:06 Author: Simon Vincze Last updated: 29 May 2023 12:06</p>
<p>As someone who has been involved in the Global Self-exclusion Initiative from the very beginning, I have often felt the weight of uncertainty surrounding this ambitious project. The idea of creating a global system for self-exclusion in the online gambling industry seemed like an insurmountable challenge at times. However, I realized that focusing on achievable milestones along the way could make this seemingly impossible task a reality.</p>
<p>One such milestone has now come to fruition as we embark on the journey to identify self-exclusion best practice in collaboration with the City, University of London and Associate Professor Margaret Carran. The lack of consistent standards for self-exclusion in the online gambling industry has created a significant gap in terms of player protection, with rules varying greatly across different jurisdictions. This lack of standards has led to challenges in implementing effective self-exclusion measures, leaving vulnerable individuals at risk./p&gt;</p>
<p>To address this issue, we have devised a comprehensive process, divided into three phases, to guide our efforts towards achieving reliable and effective self-exclusion standards.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Research &amp; fact finding</p>
<p>The first phase is focused on creating a comprehensive summary of current research on self-exclusion and an overview of the self-exclusion rules in selected jurisdictions. To augment the findings, research will also be leveraging unique data from the Casino Guru database, complemented by a survey among visitors of the Casino Guru website. Dr Margaret Carran, a renowned expert in the field, will hold the position of the project leader, providing invaluable insights and expertise to guide the project further.</p>
<p>The outcome of this phase will be the creation of a document called "Terms of Reference", which will serve as the foundation of factual information for further consultations. The document will provide a solid base for the workgroup, which will be the focal point of the second phase.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Consultations within the workgroup</p>
<p>The second phase, consultations within the workgroup, will involve collaboration with diverse stakeholders in the online gambling industry. The goal of the workgroup is twofold: to reach a consensus on as many details of the self-exclusion process as possible, and to create a recommended set of rules based on the evidence gathered in the research phase, as well as the expertise of the professionals involved. This phase will be facilitated through a series of physical and virtual meetings, with the first one set to take place in September 2023.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Broader consultations</p>
<p>The third and final phase of the project, broader consultations with industry stakeholders, will involve reaching out to a wider audience of stakeholders who were unable to participate in the workgroup. The interim self-exclusion rules and standards developed during the second phase will be shared for critical comments and suggestions. This feedback will then be incorporated by the project leader to finalize the self-exclusion standards. The resulting guidelines will provide a comprehensive and invaluable resource for experts and the general public alike to improve their self-exclusion processes.</p>
<p>The work towards identifying and recommending self-exclusion standards will be very helpful on a journey towards a global self-exclusion system but will also provide a baseline for a more effective implementation of self-exclusion in general. We are very excited to embark on this journey and look forward to making a positive impact on the online gambling industry by establishing reliable self-exclusion standards that will promote responsible gambling practices and protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>As we progress through the phases of this project, we will continue to share important updates and insights, keeping you informed on our progress. Together, we can make a difference in responsible gambling practices and improve the safeguarding of those in need of self-exclusion measures. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the Global Self-exclusion Initiative!</p>
