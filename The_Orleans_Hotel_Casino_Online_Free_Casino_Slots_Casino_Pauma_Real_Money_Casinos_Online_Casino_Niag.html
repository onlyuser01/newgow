<p>Livespins, a company that focuses on providing partner operators with a fresh type of slot streaming content, has added a brand-new developer to its list of available suppliers whose games can be streamed in real-time and introduced to audiences in a new and exciting way.</p>
<p>Onlyplay, a rising iGaming studio, has become the latest to join the award-winning platform and become a part of the socially charged revolution that Livespins is spearheading. Onlyplay shares Livespins’ passion for innovation and the company has focused on building robust next-gen slots that can be shared with players who seek innovative bit of fun.</p>
<p>Livespins allows streamers to play slots in real-time and broadcast the action to audiences, who in turn may choose to bet alongside the streamers themselves. This way, no one is left behind. The betting sizes are all adjustable and every spectator is playing at their own pace with no pressure to match the pace of the streamers.</p>
<p>The streaming platform has been securing a range of new suppliers to its name recently, adding companies such as Jelly Entertainment, Evoplay, and notably signing a landmark partnership with Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Livespins is now established as a separate game category in most casino lobbies, which makes it exceptionally easy to spot and enjoy. There are thousands of games that are now eligible for Livespins streaming, with Onlyplay adding to this continuously growing list of opportunities.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen has been pleased with the addition of this new partner, hailing Onlyplay’s slots as next-generation experiences – the type that players love.</p>
<p>"We’re talking fast, thrilling gameplay that our streamers can get excited about, and our players bet behind," Pedersen added.</p>
<p>Onlyplay Head of Partnerships Anna Serheieva was similarly pleased with the opportunity. She affirmed Onlyplay’s commitment to inventing, improving, and innovating content to extend the range of emotions that players can get out of the company’s portfolio of products.</p>
<p>"The excellence of the art and animations of Onlyplay games is definitely something to enjoy when watching Livespins’ streams," Serheieva said, confident about the future of the collaboration. Onlyplay has been fast expanding its offer, with the company strengthening its presence with various game aggregators. One such is a recent partnership with REEVO.</p>
<p>Livespins has been committed to bringing a Twitch-like experience in a responsible and sustainable way that is compliant and player-focused, and it has so far been a raging success.</p>
