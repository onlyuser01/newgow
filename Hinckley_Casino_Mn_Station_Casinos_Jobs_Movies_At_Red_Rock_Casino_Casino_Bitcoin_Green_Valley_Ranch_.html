<p>Supplier of online casino games Wazdan announced this week its expansion in the US would continue after it was granted a Lottery iGaming Interim Supplier License in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Approved in Second US Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The Lottery iGaming Interim Supplier License will allow Wazdan to offer its award-winning game titles to players in West Virginia via partnerships with active gaming operators and continue to expand its presence in the US, building on its debut in New Jersey earlier this year.</p>
<p>The US market continues to hit incredible heights and it’s a market we’ve already enjoyed some success in. Gaining our West Virginia licence is an important milestone for us, and we’re extremely eager to see what we can accomplish in the state.” Michal Imiolek, CEO, Wazdan</p>
<p>The launch in New Jersey, after Wazdan was granted a transactional waiver from the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in May, saw some of the most popular titles of the Malta-based game studio, including Sizzling 777 Deluxe, Lucky Reels, Space Spins, Power of Gods: The Pantheon, Magic Stars 3, Magic Fruits Deluxe, Relic Hunters and the Book of Faith go live and allure to the taste of local players and operators.</p>
<p>With so much more on the horizon for us in North America, it is a hugely exciting time for Wazdan, and we look forward to achieving even more in the US.” Michal Imiolek, CEO, Wazdan</p>
<p>Alongside preparations for its impending launch in the Mountain State, Wazdan is putting the finer details to its license applications in Michigan and Pennsylvania, looking to further expand its footprint in the booming online gaming market in the US and North America.</p>
<p>Global Reach</p>
<p>Outside of the US, Wazdan holds licenses in the UK, Romania, Malta, and Greece, where it was granted a license in September. The game studio is also accredited to offer its products in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Colombia and Belarus, which was the latest jurisdiction to certify its game titles. In Italy, Wazdan recently entered into a strategic partnership with content aggregator Tuko Productions to offer its casino games.</p>
<p>Last month, the developer of online slot games announced it received nominations in the Innovation in Casino Development and Casino / Slots Developer of the Year categories at the upcoming SBC Awards 2021, industry-wide recognition of its efforts to elevate the online casino experience to new heights.</p>
<p>West Virginia’s online gaming market officially launched in July 2020, and is currently featuring offerings from the top online gaming providers in the US, including DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars Entertainment, FanDuel and BetRivers, while WynnBet secured market access earlier this month and is expected to go live soon.</p>
