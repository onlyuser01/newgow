<p>Sweden-based game supplier listed on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Gaming Corps has announced a content distribution deal with aggregator and Application Programming Interface (API) framework supplier Hub88. According to the terms of the new agreement, Gaming Corps will have its entire portfolio of games reach Hub88’s affiliated operators spread in all parts of Europe and Asia. This will happen with the help of Hub88’s lightweight integration platform.</p>
<p>The Deal Comes at an Exciting Time</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ head of commercial Danielle Calafato expressed excitement about the fresh partnership with the “professional Hub88 team” and their “impressive affiliation network.” Calafato explained the connect distribution deal came at “an exciting time” as the company continues to work to make its top content popular and accessible in Asian and European markets. The “fruitful partnership” is expected to help both parties build for the future.</p>
<p>Hub88’s managing director Jose Micallef recognized the well-grounded Gaming Corps crew in the online gaming industry, welcoming their top content and looking forward to distributing it to its network of operators. Gaming Corp’s content has improved and expanded dramatically with brand new categories like Multiplier and Mines games joining the portfolio recently.</p>
<p>What Does Hub88’s Integration Platform Has to Offer?</p>
<p>Hub88 is a content integration platform that was originally created during a Hackathon for the Yolo Group. It is based on Elixir and provides seamless wallet API solutions for casino operations. At the moment, the platform is currently available with 80 providers and more than 7000 games. Operators who use it are given the chance to access a large number of tier-one providers while showing support for fresh gaming studios and a series of provably fair Random Number Generators, distribution, and game engines.</p>
<p>Casino managers who use the same integration platform from Hub88 have an easier time keeping track of their performance and key performance indicators in real-time using a dedicated app for Android and iOS mobile devices. Hub88 also offers a powerful back office with unified bonuses, business intelligence, accounting, and free spins options. These can all help increase the value of any product via flexible solutions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August, SkillOnNet decided to partner with Gaming Corps and improve its content reach by adding its games to its list of partners. According to the terms of the agreement, brands powered by SkillOnNet will get to access innovative casino games from a plethora of providers. In June, Glitnor Group inked a similar content agreement with Gaming Corps.</p>
