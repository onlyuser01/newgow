<p>Josh Parisian Is a Real Knockout Expert</p>
<p>Josh Parisian is 15-5 overall, with a 2-2 record since joining the UFC in 2020. He’s a dictionary definition of a heavyweight fighter – he’s big and strong, with incredibly strong punches.</p>
<p>The guy doesn’t tend to land too many significant strikes (4.97 per minute), but when he does, it often results in a knockdown. So far, he’s won 11 fights by knockout/technical knockout.</p>
<p>Parisian isn’t great when it comes to defending against strikes. He absorbs 5.11 significant strikes per minute, which isn’t great. However, the 265-pound heavyweight is immune to hard punches most of the time. The evidence is that he’s lost just two fights by KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Another major weakness of Parisian is takedown defense, which is 42% only. That’s actually a horrible number, knowing that heavyweights don’t often get to defend against takedowns. But on Saturday, he’ll probably have to do so.</p>
<p>Jamal Pogues Ready to Take Parisian Down</p>
<p>Saturday’s fight is going to be the first time Jamal Pogues is fighting in the UFC. He did fight in Dana White’s Contender Series twice, as well as in LFA, and other promotions. He’s 9-3 overall with four wins by KO/TKO, four by decision, and one by submission.</p>
<p>If he’s going to add another win to his portfolio, he’ll have to utilize his grappling/wrestling skills. Parisian is a better boxer than him, but Pogues is much better on the ground. This guy also knows how to make takedowns, the evidence being that in his 2019 DWCS fight, he made 7 TDs against Marcos Brigagao.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy to take Parisian down, but that seems like Pogues’ only road to a win on Saturday.</p>
<p>Josh Parisian vs Jamal Pogues Prediction</p>
<p>Parisian is some 50 pounds heavier than Pogues, meaning that he’s not as agile as his opponent. He does have the nuclear option in his fists, meaning that outboxing him won’t come easy for Pogues. However, Pogues does have one major advantage. He’s much better when it comes to wrestling and grappling. If he can take Parisian to the ground, he will almost certainly finish him with a submission.</p>
<p>Pick: Jamal Pogues to win by submission</p>
