<p>Maloney will officially join AGA’s team in January and will help advance key priorities for AGA members</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has reinforced its executive team with the appointment of the experienced Joe Maloney as senior vice president of strategic communications. In this position, the new appointee will be tasked with leading the gambling association’s communications, research, marketing and public affairs.</p>
<p>Maloney will officially join AGA’s team in January and will help advance key priorities for AGA members. He joins the AGA from the Washington Commanders, a professional football franchise. During his time with the team, Maloney served as vice president of public affairs and strategic communications. The position saw him spearhead the club’s external engagement, proving his expertise in communications.</p>
<p>As VP of public affairs for the Commanders, Maloney also steered the franchise’s legislative advocacy on sports betting in Virginia and Maryland. Thanks to this, the team was able to form key partnerships with FanDuel in Virginia and Fanatics in Maryland. Maloney was also instrumental in cementing the Washington Commanders as the first NFL team to join AGA’s “Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly.” initiative.</p>
<p>Before joining the Washington Commanders, Maloney served as a partner at Locust Street Group, a full-service public affairs agency in Washington DC. During his team with LSG, Maloney led the agency’s work on G2E and AGA’s Get to Know Gaming series.</p>
<p>Bill Miller, AGA’s president and chief executive officer, welcomed the new hire on board, saying that he will be an invaluable addition to the association’s best-in-class communications team. He described the new appointee as an “accomplished professional” who doesn’t back off when facing significant public affairs challenges.</p>
<p>We will benefit not only from his (from Maloney’s) depth of experience and his tireless advocacy, but his enthusiasm and energy to hit the ground running as a champion for the casino gaming industry. Bill Miller, president &amp; CEO, AGA</p>
<p>Maloney also commented on the matter, expressing his excitement about his new position. He noted that his new appointment comes at a “pivotal moment for the gaming industry.”</p>
<p>Maloney said: “I’m honored to join the AGA and its dedicated team at this pivotal moment for the gaming industry. The future holds great promise and I’m energized by the opportunity and challenge of communicating the remarkable benefits and economic impact of legal gaming across the country.”</p>
