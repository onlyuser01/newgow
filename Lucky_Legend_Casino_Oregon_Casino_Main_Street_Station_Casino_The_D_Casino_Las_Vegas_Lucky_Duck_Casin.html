<p>Manon Fiorot is Arguably the Best Boxer in the 125lb Division</p>
<p>Manon Fiorot started her professional career as an MMA fighter in 2016 with a decision loss to Leah McCourt, who’s now competing in Bellator. From there, however, the French fighter went on to win the next 10 fights, five of which happened in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).</p>
<p>She’s got six wins by KO/TKO and four by decision, which is no surprise considering that she’s a hell of a kickboxer. She lands 6.58 significant strikes per minute, which is the fourth-highest number in the UFC Women’s Flyweight division.</p>
<p>Still, it’s her dodging skills that make her stand out. She’s got the highest percentage of defended strikes (71.7%) in her weight class. Add to this the fact that she’s never been finished and you’ll understand why bookmakers favor her to win the UFC Paris co-main event.</p>
<p>Is Rose Namajunas Ready for the Flyweight Division?</p>
<p>Rose Namajunas is 11-5 overall, with all of her fights happening in the strawweight division. After losing the title to Carla Esparza in May 2022, she decided to move up a weight class. Her debut in the 125lb division is this Saturday.</p>
<p>She’s a very technical striker, but she’s probably not as good as Fiorot. However, she might be better than her French rival when it comes to fighting on the floor. Although Fiorot has made at least one takedown in each of her UFC fights, she’s still without a single win by submission. Namajunas, on the other hand, has five wins by this method. However, the last time “Thug” beat someone by submission was in 2017.</p>
<p>Manon Fiorot vs. Rose Namajunas Prediction</p>
<p>Manon Fiorot is a way better kickboxer than Rose Namajunas. She’s also much stronger than her opponent, meaning that “Thug” doesn’t stand a great chance of beating her by submission. That said, we think that it’s very likely that Fiorot is going to triumph in Paris, probably with a KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Pick: Manon Fiorot to win</p>
