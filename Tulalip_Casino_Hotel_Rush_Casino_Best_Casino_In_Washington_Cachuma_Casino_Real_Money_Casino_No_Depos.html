    <h1>Tulalip Casino Hotel Rush Casino Best Casino In Washington Cachuma Casino Real Money Casino No Depos</h1>

<p>Dear Anna,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://wintika.com/en/terms_and_conditions/:</p>
<p>"Maximum Winnings.</p>
<p>Player winnings are subject to maximum limits (i.e., maximum win cap) for each consecutive 7 calendar days, irrespective of the number of bets, the total stakes invested, or however placed. These maximums apply even if the level of potential winnings exceeds these amounts;</p>
<p>Our maximum winnings for each Player in any consecutive 7 calendar days is 10,000 EUR or the currency equivalent (for the sake of clarity, in case the Player has won more than the maximum winning amount and/or within the period stated herein, the residual amount will be cancelled);</p>
<p>It is the Player’s responsibility to follow up his/her number of bets, the total stakes invested or however placed, and maximum winnings he/she can gain within the period stated herein;</p>
<p>The foregoing does not apply to winnings of progressive jackpots."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are fully aware of this unfair rule, but we’re not in position to change the casino’s T&amp;Cs. The same information and warning are clearly highlighted in our review for the Wintika Casino https://casino.guru/Wintika-Casino-review:</p>
<p>"Warning: Wintika Casino has a €10,000 weekly total win limit. This means that the sum of your wins in one week (not factoring in your losses), can't be higher than €10,000. If you win more, you will not get the money exceeding the limit. We consider any win limit to be extremely unfair to players, which is why we penalize any casino that has implemented it, unless the win limit is enforced by third-party factors, such as local regulations."</p>
<p>As you can see from all of the information in our review, Wintika Casino is a very bad online casino. We don't recommend playing at it and strongly advise you to stay away from it.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
