<p>Ezugi inked a strategic agreement with Sisal, the gaming and lottery giant in Italy. As a result of the agreement, Ezugi content is now live for customers of Sisal’s online casino and sports betting portal.</p>
<p>Ezugi Partners with Sisal for the Italian Market</p>
<p>Ezugi, the live dealer gaming provider, increased its presence in the Italian market after inking a partnership with Sisal today. By partnering with the gaming and lottery giant, Ezugi launched its live roulette offering for Sisal customers last week. As a result, Ezugi’s live roulette content is now available on Sisal’s online casino and sports betting portal. Furthermore, the company revealed that it plans to launch blackjack and punto banco on Sisal’s platform soon.</p>
<p>“This is a significant strategic deal for Ezugi and one that underlines our commitment to the vibrant Italian market.” Rais Busom, territory manager, Ezugi</p>
<p>Rais Busom, Ezugi’s territory manager, said that the partnership is a significant strategic deal for the company. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the deal reaffirms Ezugi’s commitment to the Italian market. Busom stressed that Ezugi is honored to partner with a major brand like Sisal. In conclusion, he said that the recent deal underlines the company’s strategy of “seeking out blue-chip partnerships in exciting growth markets“.</p>
<p>Italy’s Online Gaming Market Continues to Grow</p>
<p>The online gaming market in Italy has been growing increasingly recently. In 2020, the market in Italy indicated a 46.5% growth, which is one of the reasons why Ezugi chose it. Furthermore, live dealer games’ popularity has skyrocketed in recent years, not only in Italy but all around the world as well.</p>
<p>Founded in 1945, currently, Sisal is one of the biggest B2C operators in Italy. The company runs the SuperEnalotto lottery and earlier this week, it revealed that it plans to bid against Camelot for the National Lottery in the UK. Currently, Sisal has more than 39,000 retail outlets in Italy.</p>
<p>Focusing on Ezugi, we see a company that broadcasts from nine studios globally. The company broadcasts from Europe, Asia, as well as Latin America. Furthermore, Ezugi offers a fully customizable platform. In other words, thanks to the new partnership, Sisal’s games will have Italian dealers which add a localized look and feel.</p>
