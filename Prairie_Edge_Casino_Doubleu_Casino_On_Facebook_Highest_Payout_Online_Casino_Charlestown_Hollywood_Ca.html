    <h1>Prairie Edge Casino Doubleu Casino On Facebook Highest Payout Online Casino Charlestown Hollywood Ca</h1>

<p>Hi, this past weekend mbitcasino was having a Gamebeat branded race. I was up about $3,000 at the time and decided to make a run at this race. I clicked on the specific race, read the terms and conditions (included) and also read the general rules and bonus rules that are referenced.</p>
<p>I proceed to play and lose all $3,000. That's fine, it happens, no big deal. Most of my play was on Gamebeat Roaring Lion, some on Buffalo Trail. The following morning, I notice I'm nowhere on the leaderboard. I wagered about 150 mbtc which would have put me in second or third. I ask support, no one can explain why I'm not listed.</p>
<p>I decide to do a google.search and find an older promotional post about this event and it specified that only 6 or 7 games were included.</p>
<p>As a new customer, I never saw this post and had no idea this post existed. Literally the only way to find the MOST IMPORTANT terms would be to have gone back into the promotions tab and searched down for this post and read it as well.</p>
<p>No, why in the world would the most specific terms for the race not be included in the specific race terms and conditions. I clicked on the race, clicked on the terms, and it mentioned nothing about game restrictions. It didn't say to go read even more terms in an older promotional post about this event.</p>
<p>It's absolute nonsense. How could an oversight of something that monumentally important just be forgotten from the Gamebeat terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I simply asked the casino to award me the free Gamebeat spins that would be commiserate with where I would have finished in this race. They have totally ignored my request and appear unwilling to accept their error or take care of the customer who was blatantly cheated out of money by participating in this race.</p>
