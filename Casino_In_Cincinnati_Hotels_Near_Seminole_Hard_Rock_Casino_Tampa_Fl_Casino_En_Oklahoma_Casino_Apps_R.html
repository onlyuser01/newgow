<p>Onyx Sports Book debuts at Turtle Creek Casino</p>
<p>William Hill U.S. has rolled out the Onyx Sports Book at Turtle Creek Casino in Michigan, bringing another opportunity to northern Michigan residents to bet legally.</p>
<p>Partnered with the Turtle Creek Casino, William Hill, which recently acquired CG Technology, launched its product on Wednesday, September 23, and invited former Detroit Pistons and NBA All-Star player Rick Mahorn for the inauguration.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by National Indian Gaming Association Chairman Ernest L. Stevens, Jr. To celebrate the opening, Mahorn placed his first bet at the venue and the first bet to go live at Onyx Sports Book.</p>

<p>Speaking on the occasional, William Hill VP of Strategy &amp; Business Development Dan Shapiro said that Turtle Creek Casino’s grand opening was the 13th state in which William Hill had a sports betting offer all set up and ready to go.</p>
<p>According to Shapiro, this is just a stepping-stone for the future relationships between the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and William Hill. The company is also planning to launch a mobile betting solution to empower the portfolio further.</p>
<p>However, William Hill will have to await regulatory approval before mobile betting and iGaming has become available. Meanwhile, the sportsbook will be available at the Turtle Creek Casino &amp; Hotel and satellite location at Leelanau Sands Casino, both operated by Grand Traverse Resort &amp; Casinos.</p>
<p>The Partnership Is a Win-Win for Northern Michigan</p>
<p>Leelanau Sands Casino will only host two kiosks for sports betting, though, with limited access due to COVID-19 restrictions. Sports bettor may place a bet between 8 am and 2 am, with the guidelines revised once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided.</p>
<p>Grand Traverse Resort &amp; Casinos CEO Michael Schrader shared his own enthusiasm to be teaming up with William Hill. Schrader’s company was excited to align with William Hill, which he described as the leading purveyor of sports betting solutions for the US market. He further added:</p>
<p>“They are the best in the business, and that’s always what we strive to give our guests. We have an excellent, trained staff to assist customers with getting their bets down.”</p>
<p>Schrader argued that the company would seek to provide sports bettors with the best experience possible and with William Hill by their side that seemed feasible.</p>
<p>When Michigan regulators approve online gambling, including iGaming, Schrader is convinced that the partnership with William Hill will pay off once again. The current tie up was a win-win for Northern Michigan, Schrader concluded.</p>
<p>William Hill launched a dedicated mobile sportsbook in Illinois last week. The company also set up its mobile sports betting product in West Virginia at the beginning of the year.</p>
