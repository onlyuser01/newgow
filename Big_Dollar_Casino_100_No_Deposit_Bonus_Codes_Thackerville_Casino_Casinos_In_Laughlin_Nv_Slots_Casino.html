    <h1>Big Dollar Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes Thackerville Casino Casinos In Laughlin Nv Slots Casino</h1>

<p>The fast-growing provider of next-generation tech, solutions and products, powering online sportsbooks, lottery and casino operators, EGT Digital, announced a new deal, propelling its European footprint. The company confirmed it joined forces with AdmiralBet, agreeing to power the company's operations in Serbia. Details regarding the new partnership emerged last week and see EGT Digital deliver some of its most popular games for www.admiralbet.rs in Serbia.</p>
<p>The partnership represents an important deal for AdmiralBet Serbia as it grows its offering, delivering fan-favorite titles. Similarly, the strategic collaboration helps expand the reach of EGT Digital's quality games and ultimately boosts the company's European footprint.</p>
<p>In a statement, AdmiralBet Serbia's Head of Online Gaming, Milan Djurmez, was excited about the freshly minted content agreement with the fast-growing iGaming content supplier. "EGT Digital’s titles very quickly won the hearts of our customers and are currently among the most preferred on our site, which is not surprising given the success of EGT’s land-based products," he explained. Finally, Djurmez pointed out: "We look forward to trying their next proposals."</p>
<p>Besides the partnership for the gambling sector in Serbia, EGT Digital confirmed another important achievement recently. Last week, the company said that it secured a license from the gambling regulator in Greece, the Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC). Thanks to the HGC license, EGT Digital can now offer its content to licensed gambling operators in the European country, further expanding its European footprint.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the deal in Serbia, Tsvetomira Drumeva, EGT Digital's Head of Sales, was excited about the collaboration with AdmiralBet. "Thanks to our collaboration with Admiralbet we have the opportunity to present our high-quality gaming content to the customers of one of the most prominent online casinos in the country and strengthen our positions on the local market, while at the same time supporting the operator to gain even more popularity among Serbian players," she said.</p>
<p>Teaming up with one of Serbia's leading gaming operators, EGT Digital's quality games will reach new customers. As a result, clients of the operator will be able to access Clover Chance, High Cash, Bell Link, as well as Single Progressive Jackpot, among other hit games from the leading gambling industry content supplier.</p>
