<p>Aristocrat’s offerings will be available on FanDuel’s online casinos, bringing new experiences to the players on the operator’s platform</p>
<p>However, as FanDuel’s online casino platform is currently available in West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Connecticut, players will need to be physically present in either one of these states to get access to the new Anaxi content.</p>
<p>An Exciting Partnership</p>
<p>As a major US operator, FanDuel’s platform will be a big stage for Anaxi’s content. This is especially true when considering that Anaxi was announced at G2E Vegas back in October 2022, as Aristocrat’s real money gaming (RMG)brand. Players will have a choice of Aristocrat’s various games through the FanDuel online casino platform, including Dolphin Treasure and Wild Ameri’coins.</p>
<p>A Gambling Insider report cited how excited both companies were. Cath Burns, executive vice president of Anaxi, and Asaf Noifeld, managing director, Casino at FanDuel, both expressed their delight in the partnership, and both agreed that this will bring players an elevated and seamless gaming experience and loads of high-quality entertainment.</p>
<p>While Anaxi’s primary focus lies in iGaming products for the US market, it also has an international footprint through various content studios and other partnerships. Aristocrat acquired Roxor Gaming recently, strengthening Anaxi’s operations and its iGaming presence. It’s been a very busy period these past few months for Anaxi on other fronts, too, though.</p>
<p>Anaxi Keeping Busy</p>
<p>BetMGM joined forces with Anaxi in mid-February, covering another gambling behemoth. The sports betting giant formed a strategic partnership with Anaxi to strengthen its own online casino. BetMGM aimed to make its online casino offering the best destination for players, thanks to Anaxi’s expertise and creative capabilities. This was not the only such partnership that Anaxi struck, though.</p>
<p>The beginning of March saw Anaxi and Caesars Sportsbook and Casino announcing a new partnership, where the extraordinary operator was also aiming to provide the best player experience possible worldwide. Caesars is competitive in most – if not all – of the states where FanDuel has a foothold, and its Caesars Casino Library is now also enriched with Anaxi’s content.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that CTFN, a data provider, speculated in early March that Caesars could be potentially trying to make a move and bid for Flutter Entertainment – one of the parent organizations behind the FanDuel brand. It’s unlikely that if such a move could be viable, Caesars would be the only company trying to get a hold of the hugely popular brand, though.</p>
