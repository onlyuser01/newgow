<p>Joyce intends to “right the wrongs of his first fight“ and go on to challenge for world titles</p>
<p>The professional British heavyweight boxer Joe Joyce has unveiled a new partnership with BetVictor. The announcement comes a week before Joyce’s highly anticipated match against Zhilei Zhang. With much on the line, the clash between Joyce and Zhang is one of the hottest events of the year.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, BetVictor’s logo will feature at the fight night and will appear across the equipment of Joyce’s team. BetVictor will continue to support the professional boxer throughout the fight week prior to the clash, producing exclusive content for boxing fans.</p>
<p>The promotional content will build up hype for the fight and BetVictor’s exclusive promotions for the event.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership arrangement with BetVictor, Joyce said that he is very excited and proud to join forces with the company and “have them in his corner” for his rematch against Zhang. Joyce added that he is bullish on “righting the wrongs” of his previous fight against his rival.</p>
<p>I’m intending to right the wrongs of the first fight and go on to challenge for world titles, so I am grateful for their support for one of the biggest fights of my career. Joe Joyce, professional boxer</p>
<p>BetVictor Is Excited to Support Joyce</p>
<p>Sam Boswell, BetVictor’s head of sponsorship, also commented on the matter, expressing his company’s delight about the tie-up. Boswell lauded Joyce as a “boxer who has a proven ability at the top level.” The BetVictor representative praised the athlete’s determination to become one of the best in the world and promised to promote him through a variety of activations.</p>
<p>Alongside traditional partnership activations, we will have great content following Joe in fight week across our social media channels plus plenty of promotions for both new and existing customers around the rematch on the 23rd of September. Sam Boswell, head of sponsorship, BetVictor</p>
<p>Lastly, S-JAM Boxing’s head of commercial, Harry Phillips, said: “We are delighted to partner with BetVictor as Joe’s official betting partner.” Philips lauded BetVictor as one of the most influential sports betting operators in Europe and a company that believes in Joyce as much as S-JAM Boxin does.</p>
<p>A few months ago, BetVictor renewed its sponsorship arrangement with the World Snooker Tour, reaffirming its support of professional snooker. Under the deal, BetVictor agreed to sponsor a total of eight events throughout the 2023/24 season.</p>
