<p>The Association’s aggregate results show growth in all sectors besides table games, indicating the US market still possesses untapped potential</p>
<p>AGA’s Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker highlighted impressive gross gaming revenue (GGR) in April, marking the 8th month in a row the result exceeded $5 billion. Although revenues failed to match last month’s performance, the industry still grew year-over-year, indicating the dip primarily resulted from seasonal trends.</p>
<p>April Showed Growth across Most Verticals</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) is the premier trade association representing the US gaming industry, releasing regular reports on the state of the market. The most recent April results indicate a 7.8% year-on-year growth as revenues reached an impressive $5.41 billion. This month is the eighth in a row exceeding $5 billion, reflecting the industry’s recovery and sustained growth.</p>
<p>Slots traditionally contributed the most with $2.99 billion, followed by sports betting at $820.4 million and table games generating $775 million. iGaming also performed admirably, bringing in $504.3 million in revenue. State-wise, Nevada led the pack with $1.16 billion, while Pennsylvania narrowly edged out New Jersey for second place with $486.4 million vs $462.7 million.</p>
<p>Almost all segments enjoyed growth except table games, which dropped by 1%. Sports betting performed exceptionally well, with annual gross gaming revenue (GGR) swelling by 69.1%. While land-based gaming only rose 0.3%, the online sector grew significantly by 50.4%, bolstered by recent legalization in several states.</p>
<p>Long-Term Prospects Remain Optimistic</p>
<p>April’s results further solidify the existing industry trends. Sports betting and iGaming remain the biggest winners, but steady results across the retail sector indicate the online industry does not pose any significant competition and can even be complimentary. Casino operators focus on bolstering the appeal of their land-based offerings, attracting an audience that values the whole casino experience.</p>
<p>This marked the 26th consecutive month of annual growth, a testament to the industry’s resilience and continued appeal. AGA April report</p>
<p>While revenues increased year-on-year, April failed to match March’s results. Such a dip should not be of immediate concern, as seasonality is very common in the sector, especially regarding sports betting. March Madness traditionally causes sportsbook revenues to skyrocket, while the following months experience a gradual slowdown as leagues enter the summer season.</p>
<p>The $5.41 billion figure reflects the US gambling industry’s ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and overcome emerging challenges. The ASA remains optimistic despite economic pressures. Although momentum will likely slow down in the coming months, many markets have achieved sufficient sustainability to retail profitability and continue stimulating economic activity in communities across the USA.</p>
