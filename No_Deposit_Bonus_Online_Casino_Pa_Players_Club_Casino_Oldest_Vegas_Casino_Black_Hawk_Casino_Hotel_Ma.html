    <h1>No Deposit Bonus Online Casino Pa Players Club Casino Oldest Vegas Casino Black Hawk Casino Hotel Ma</h1>

<p>So, let me see that Im hearing this right. Its not Okay to win at this casino over a technicality that you made up, however,it IS OK to STEAL my deposits first, request some winnings and then keep ALL my money. You CANT take my deposits first and then throw that rubbish at me. You're acting like a spoilt brat where someone took your lollies. I was winning , you were losing.</p>
<p>to catch these infractions that weren't there before. What the heck is this? We played for fun , we never broke any SECURITY stuff. You make out that we are criminals , where you are the ILLEGAL operation.</p>
<p>Nick, you Did just completely ignore my last post like you do ALL my Emails?</p>
<p>I made 21 Deposits in January which is my Hard-earned money expecting to have some fun and maybe a win or 2,</p>
<p>Not expecting to be robbed like this. I want the deposits at the very least that you took from me , knowing that you were never going to Payout.</p>
<p>You also kept the money in my account which I have no idea how much that was. ( A couple of hundred dollars i suspect ) This MUST be unlawful, and if this is'nt resolved soon , I have been advised to seek Legal action. The ACCC government body of Australia is also investigating the Illegal practice of Planet7 OZ in Australia. I Demand that you Pay my winnings owed and I will cease this action</p>
<p>You donâ€™t Pay! Why do I pay ?</p>
<p>I deposited regularly in January . The wins didnt come for free. During January, I deposited $3759.00</p>
<p>You take ALL my deposits in January totalling $3759.00, with the knowledge that you are going to cancel our accounts very soon, because I was Winning in excess of $11000.00 ( You paid ONE $2460.00 )</p>
<p>And further more can you ask Nick why All 10 or so of my Emails are simply IGNORED. No one will talk to me. What sort of business treats its customers in this fashion?</p>
<p>Peter can you help please. This guy just doesnt get it</p>
<p>Thanks Peter and Nick</p>
<p>Regards Garry</p>
