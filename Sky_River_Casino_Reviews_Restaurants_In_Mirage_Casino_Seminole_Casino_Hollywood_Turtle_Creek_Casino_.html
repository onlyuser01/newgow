    <h1>Sky River Casino Reviews Restaurants In Mirage Casino Seminole Casino Hollywood Turtle Creek Casino</h1>

<p>I signed up with this casino and received a no deposit bonus of $100 with a playthrough of $6,000. I got through the playthrough and requested a withdrawal of $100 and it has been declined twice due to "mixing funds". I redeemed $5 in comp points after submitting that withdrawal because after going thru there terms and conditions and bonus conditions, it didn't say anything about comp points being something that is considered mixing funds. But here's the kicker, I never received the money from redeeming my comp points. I even chatted with support about it and they couldn't do anything about it. So I said okay whatever it was just $5. But even though I didn't get it, that's the reason they denied it. Now, when I submitted my first withdrawal, I was wanting to do a deposit match bonus and deposit because i still wanted to play. So I got on chat to be able to do that even though, on my end it wasn't allowing me to. I spoke with 2 different chat agents that were allowing me to do that, which is considered mixing funds, but yet they keep denying my withdrawal for $5 I did not receive. A support chat guy even told me that I needed to message them if I wanted to make a deposit while having $5+ still in my account so that I avoided mixing cash and bonus balance. I wound up not depositing. I went thru every term and condition on there website and there is nothing on there that states what they are saying. I have had 3 tickets created and no one has reached back out to me to help. No one has sent me any emails except to tell me it was denied because the comp points. Everytime I respond, I get nothing back. Now when I chat with support, they tell me they can't look at things pertaining to my withdrawal because I haven't made a deposit yet. So here I am, $135 still in my account, no one reaching out to me, and my withdrawal still being denied over $5 I didn't get.</p>
