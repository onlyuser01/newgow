<p>ParlayBay, a supplier of innovative sports betting titles, has formed a new content alliance with BlueOcean Gaming, which focuses on creating platform solutions for the online casino sector. This will mean that moving forward, ParlayBay will incorporate its entire portfolio of titles with BlueOcean Gaming’s platform, helping it deliver more impactful gamification options for its own network of operators.</p>
<p>ParlayBay Deploys Extensive Portfolio of Unique Games</p>
<p>As such, ParlayBay will get significant exposure to its product with leading operators. ParlayBay has been known for a number of games already, including Streak, Boss, Gekko, Cut, Greyhound, and Rush titles. This partnership has been welcomed by ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall who said:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to have reached this partnership with BlueOcean Gaming, a company that shares our vision for innovating in iGaming. BlueOcean Gaming is one of the most recognized aggregators in the market and has a sublime and efficient platform that perfectly complements our fast-paced titles. ParlayBay CEO Patrick Nordwall</p>
<p>There will be additional solutions incorporated with this partnership, including the PARLAYPOWERS tool, which features a number of promotional solutions designed to help with player acquisition and retention. These tools will be launched in early 2023 and complement the offer.</p>
<p>They will come with options such as early bird bonuses, cash drops, free bets, and many other options that are designed to improve the overall offer significantly. ParlayBay similarly features an in-house odds engine developed to provide players and consumers with real-time game states, multi-betting functionality, and more.</p>
<p>BlueOcean Gaming Executives Are Excited to Be Teaming with ParlayBay</p>
<p>ParlayBay is attempting to build an innovative form of entertainment product designed to appeal to a large number of demographics familiar with other aspects of the iGaming markets, including social gaming experience, casino, and sports betting options.</p>
<p>BlueOcean Gaming CEO Dejan Jović was similarly excited to be teaming up with ParlayBay and offered his opinion.</p>
<p>We’re always on the lookout for exciting additions to our platform and with ParlayBay’s unique approach to sports betting, we’re confident we’ve made the right choice. BlueOcean CEO Dejan Jović</p>
<p>Overall, Jović expects this tie-up to lead to further opportunities in terms of player engagement across numerous markets in which BlueOcean Gaming’s partners operate.</p>
