<p>Nordic casino and gaming brand Winlandia has launched in the United Kingdom after obtaining a highly coveted license from the UK Gabling Commission. Moving forward, Winlandia, which recently rebranded from Finlandia, is embarking on further strengthening its international reach, well beyond its home country – Finland, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>The brand is powered by SkillOnNet which brings it tons of ready games and a technological platform that makes the experience from start to finish much simpler for players. This includes payment options such as bank cards, e-wallets, and mobile payment solutions, but also unique bonusing, and player-favorite titles.</p>
<p>Speaking of, Winlandia actually has more than 5,700 games to offer with a heavy focus on slots in all their permutations, but also live dealer and table games.</p>
<p>Players can further get to know the brand by participating in its many day-to-day bonus features, such as tournaments or free spins that are collected as you play. A VIP club makes the stay with the casino even more worthwhile as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on this watershed launch in the UK market, Winlandia Head of Acquisitions &amp; PR Christoffer Grönlund said that he was excited to see UK players welcome the operator’s top-notch offering.</p>
<p>"It is not every day a new casino launches in the UK so for a period of time we will of course have a strong USP as the newest casino in the UK. That is a huge magnet for customer acquisition," he said, hinting that the UK has become a lucrative but rather competitive market making every new launch there a well-considered decision.</p>
<p>Grönlund similarly mentioned that Winlandia was determined to set its offer apart in the market and create and bring experiences that are familiar to Finnish players but will also resonate with audiences in the UK.</p>
<p>Winlandia announced its rebranding earlier this year, with the Finlandia brand vowing to expand well beyond the boundaries of its homeland of Finland and deliver on new and exciting opportunities across the world. The casino embarked on bringing its diverse range of products to various markets, with the United Kingdom Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, just some of the targeted launches and jurisdictions.</p>
