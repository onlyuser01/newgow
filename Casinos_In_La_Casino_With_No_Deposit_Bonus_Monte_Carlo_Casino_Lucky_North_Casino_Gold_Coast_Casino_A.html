<p>Sports Information Services (SIS), a multi-channel supplier of live betting services, has made a foray into Chile through a deal with Estelarbet, a local gambling operator. Under the agreement, SIS will provide its new partner with 24/7 racing content.</p>
<p>SIS Enters Chile with Estelarbet</p>
<p>As agreed, SIS will power Estelarbet with its critically acclaimed nonstop live racing content. As per the deal, the supplier will power Estelarbet’s operations in Chile, Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with the Chilean operator, SIS will provide it with content from 65,000 live horse and greyhound races a year from more than 170 racecourses across the world. This will allow Estelarbet to boost its revenues and provide its customers with reliable and profitable short-form content. Customers will get to wager on an event every three minutes, making sure that there is always an event they can look forward to.</p>
<p>If racing isn’t to the liking of Estelarbet customers, they will also be able to wager on professional esports events, which SIS will supply to the operator. SIS is renowned for the integrity of its esports offerings, offering thrilling competitive action to its clients.</p>
<p>The provider covers many of the world’s best horse racing events, including races in the United Kingdom and Ireland and international meetings from many other countries. SIS also offers greyhound racing content from the UK, Ireland and Mexico, allowing companies to further spice up their content.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Improve Estelarbet’s Profitability</p>
<p>Estelarbet’s chief executive officer, Sebastián Salazar, lauded SIS’ package of market-leading racing channels for offering just the right amount of betting content the operator is looking for. Salazar is certain that the partnership will add significant value to Estelarbet’s offerings while providing exciting new content for sports betting fans. The CEO is certain that Estelarbet players are going to love the new racing markets they will be able to access.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oscar Murueta González, SIS’s commercial executive for the Latin American region, praised Estelarbet for growing into a local powerhouse. He called the operator an “ideal platform” for SIS’ 24/7 Live Racing content.</p>
<p>This deal represents our debut in Chile and will see Estelarbet benefit from access to the wealth of quick-fire betting opportunities our services provide, and we are sure that Estelarbet’s online customers from across all the territories will be highly engaged by our racing content offer. Oscar Murueta González, commercial executive for LATAM, SIS</p>
<p>González concluded that he is sure the agreement is going to be “of great benefit” to Estelarbet, which is currently seeking to improve its profitability.</p>
