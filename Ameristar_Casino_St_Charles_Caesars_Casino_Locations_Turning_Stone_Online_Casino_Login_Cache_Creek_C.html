    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Charles Caesars Casino Locations Turning Stone Online Casino Login Cache Creek C</h1>

<p>Hello again my friends first will let me take this opportunity to advise that casino guru I feel is the best site out there for our players who have a voice so thank you for being there next the issue at hand is with jackpot city casino where I have deposited over $5000 never been able to withdraw then I finally was able to get lucky and win 1100 by the time I was able to withdraw it was only 300 I kept on using the reverse withdrawal method although I explained that I was a problem gambler I tried to self exclude myself they would not allow me to do that unless I jump through more hoops.</p>
<p>hi I tried to change my passcode having a friend do that for me I was able to use it forgot passcode etc. etc. and I finally advised that I wish out of exclude myself I went through plenty of aggravation and stress and agony and they allowed me to do such I was now trying to withdraw the $300 and no issues have been there up until I received information that they needed my documents</p>
<p>again I stress that there is no requirement for these documents to be provided when I deposited over $5000 but when I wish to withdraw $300 the documents all of a sudden are important I hope you can understand my frustration and my complete feelings of no justification on how you allow me to lose $5000 without any documents whatsoever but the moment I try to withdraw even $300 small amount originally it was $1000 may I add now on the documents are important I find this disgusting</p>
<p>anyways since my account is locked due to my request of self exclusion I have had problems in getting my documents to them I have done this now three different occasions I have sent in my kyc requirement documents. I have sent this now to three different email addresses I have Kat contacted life-support and all I wish is he even know if my documents were received no communication I have been back to me furthermore I have received that the emails that I sent in Merced back due to the file not be able to transmit it and they have tried 15 times to send in and the email address refused it can you please assist me in getting my money and I would like to review that this casino is again so bad when it comes to paying out there’s no problems depositing however such a problem paying out</p>
<p>again I find that you know casino guru is the only voice of the online community has in getting to the bottom of any problems because these casinos are very shady in their efforts to not ever pay out and this is something that I think you should be applauded for casino guru you are the best I hope you’re able to help me out</p>
