    <h1>Aurora Casino Hollywood New Sweeps Cash Casino Seminole Hard Rock Casino Florida Casino In Queens Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Mdarifmia,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://slotsempire.com/en/terms/:</p>
<p>"The Casino does not accept real money wagers from the residents of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Costa Rica, Curacao, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Please note that wagers, login sessions, bets or any other activities are forbidden from the mentioned locations. This restriction includes residents of other states performing such activities from the locations in the above mentioned list. Please note that any activities performed from the restricted countries are also forbidden for players, who use VPN connections and other malware that helps to play from the restricted countries. Please note - the website does not bear any legal liability for any actions provided to violate these restrictions."</p>
<p>Since there is no longer a possibility to register an account from a restricted country (see the screenshot below), I would like you to advise how long ago you have registered your account?</p>
<p>Is there a registration email that you could forward to petronela.k@casino.guru?</p>
<p>Additionally, could you please confirm, that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location when opening the account? Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
