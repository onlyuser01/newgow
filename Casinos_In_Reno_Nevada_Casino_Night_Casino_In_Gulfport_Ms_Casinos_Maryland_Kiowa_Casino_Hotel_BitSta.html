    <h1>Casinos In Reno Nevada Casino Night Casino In Gulfport Ms Casinos Maryland Kiowa Casino Hotel BitSta</h1>

<p>Now</p>
<p>I understand now but my dispute and the terminology of insurance means you’re protected</p>
<p>Now the toggle or the button for bonus insurance on my account was active. This means if you somehow missed a bonus in my understanding that button is on so you don’t have that headache.</p>
<p>Monday, they offer 50% reload bonus and I didn’t understand because they’ve got a countdown on them promotion. I was on the assumption that you deposit on Monday and you get your cash back. Once the Monday finishes not instantly because that’s what I understood</p>
<p>Then by looking at having a option bonus insurance, what is the point of having that option when you’re relying that you won’t miss out on a bonus</p>
<p>I contacted support and said that I’ve been depositing all day on Monday and I haven’t received any of my cash back or reload, and they said under their claws if I don’t know to find straight away and continue playing under 3.29 I forfeit my bonus or cash back now I feel that that is a little bit harsh when number one how am I meant to know that mind you they have got that button that says bonus insurance and it’s clicked on but then it’s my fault because of their technical erro !!!</p>
<p>they first told me that I was not entitled to it, because I did not have the button switched on, but then I showed them I had it switched on and then they turned around and said well. You should’ve contacted us firstly oh how have they got a double chance, and I don’t like the little bit unfair and mind you they’ve got a rating of 10 out of 10 and I haven’t done anything wrong and they just shut the door on you. They do not even want to negotiate anything. Are we talking substantial amount of money close to $400?</p>
<p>A good casino with high ratings like that would look at the amount of money that I spent look at the erro wasn’t at my fault. It was their system, and then would negotiate all just reload, my bonuses and not reflect to their terms and conditions. That’s just silly and sly.</p>
