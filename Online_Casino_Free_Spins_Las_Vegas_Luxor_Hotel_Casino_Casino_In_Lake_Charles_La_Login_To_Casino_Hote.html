<p>BtoBet named yesterday Zoran Spasov as its permanent Managing Director and Diman Reiderman as its new Chief Operating Officer.</p>
<p>From Interim to Permanent Managing Director</p>
<p>iGaming and sport betting platform developer BtoBet has announced major changes in its senior management team, with the appointment of Zoran Spasov and Dima Reiderman as Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer, respectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Spasov served as BtoBet’s interim MD since December 2019, now moving to a permanent position. He has significant experience in executive roles at various other online gaming-related businesses, and has served as Chief Executive Officer at Clip Media Group, a specialized digital media company.</p>
<p>The new BtoBet MD said he is excited to take on this role for “the multitude of opportunities that lie ahead for BtoBet”. He also commended the company’s “proven […] resilience despite external pressures”, refering to the difficult year the gaming industry faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have no doubt BtoBet will continue to establish itself as a major player in the industry,” he declared.</p>
<p>Transfer from BtoBet’s Parent Aspire Global</p>
<p>BtoBet’s new COO, Dima Reiderman, previously held the same position at the iGaming provider’s parent company, Aspire Global for over two years. Aspire Global acquired BtoBein in September 2020 for about $24 million.</p>
<p>According to BtoBet, Mr. Redeirman greatly contributed to Aspire’s expansion and growth during his seven year tenure.</p>
<p>“My main aim is to not only ensure that BtoBet excels with its sportsbook product in new markets but to maintain leading positions in emerging markets such as Africa and Latin America,” Mr. Reiderman declared.</p>
<p>Aspire CEO Tsachi Maimon said that the senior management changes will consolidate the company’s current expansion and strenghten its global growth, with the US and Europe in BtoBet’s visor. The provider inked various supply deals last year and an agreement with top operator Betfair which just acquired a five-year license to enter the Colombian online gaming market this year.</p>
