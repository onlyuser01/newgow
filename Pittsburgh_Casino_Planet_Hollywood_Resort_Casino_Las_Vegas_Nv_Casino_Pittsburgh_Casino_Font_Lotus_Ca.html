<p>Yggdrasil and Peter &amp; Sons have announced the launch of a brand new 6x6 slot with the Game Engagement Mechanic</p>
<p>The global publisher of iGaming content decided to start the year with a new collaboration with the fresh game development studio by launching Dragon Blox GigaBlox. The game brings a minimum of one giant symbol with each new spin landing, giving players an expanded win potential.</p>

<p>Meet the Fierce Sleeping Dragon</p>
<p>Slot aficionados who are familiar with Peter &amp; Sons’ previous fantasy world-based slot Monster Blox game launched in November 2021 are expected to appreciate the fresh release. With similarly crafted visual elements and reels packed with courageous adventurers, flashy symbols, and cool Wild symbols, the new slot has a lot to bring to the table.</p>
<p>The theme revolves around a mysterious dungeon-like location with a red dragon sleeping on top of a mountain made of shiny treasurers ready to be grabbed. The game symbols are represented by spades, clubs, diamonds, stars, and hearts as lower-value symbols.</p>
<p>Low-paying symbols pay 0.4x to 0.6x the initial bet when matching six of a kind. Knights, archers, wizards, warriors, and characters that resemble hobbits represent high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new release, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy described it as a slot that mixes Peter &amp; Sons’ “unmistakable art style with exciting mechanics and bonus features” for a formula that is prone to be a winner. McCarthy also mentioned their YG Masters program which has now entered its fourth year.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons’ business development manager Yann Bautista called 2022 a year when the studio came “in leaps and bounds” while expressing their thrill to enter the new year with this fresh release.</p>
<p>Bautista further explained the new slot is built on all the elements that the studio is constantly delivering while using “another of Yggdrasil’s fantastic GEMs” to generate a premium player experience.</p>
<p>Monster Free Spins and Lock’N Blox Bonuses</p>
<p>With its Monster Free Spins and Lock’N Blox Bonus features, the game has every chance to keep the fun going and the adrenaline pumping for a long time. The Monster Free Spins bonus round is triggered once a minimum of six Free Spin symbols are seen landing during just one spin. During this round, all scatters on the reels generate an extra spin.</p>
<p>Players are also given the opportunity to unlock the Lock’N Blox round during the Free Spin round. Players receive Lock’N Blox spins whenever they manage to land at least six coins on the reels.</p>
<p>This will automatically trigger a round of respins with the first three spins being awarded straight away. The respins will reset whenever a successful turn of the reels will take place. The coins can also merge and reveal an even more impressive win potential, with the multiplier set at up to 5,000x.</p>
<p>Last year saw Yggdrasil and Peter &amp; Sons release other cool titles, including Dungeon Tower MultiMax in November and Voodoo Hex in September.</p>
