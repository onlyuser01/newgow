<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I heard a few players recommending Casigo, so I decided to register, take their welcome bonus, and play the slots.</p>
<p>I was very lucky. I struck several bonuses, amounting to about $4,699 CAD. I withdrew the amounts in two withdrawals on March 25, 2022. I spent that Friday evening playing through the wagering requirements, being mindful to not exceed $5 CAD. Not once did I exceed $5 per spin. At the end of the night, I was able to cash out with the sum listed above.</p>
<p>Today, I checked the status of my withdrawals to determine if they had been processed. My withdrawals were no longer present in my account. They were not under "pending withdrawal" or "accepted withdrawals". They just disappeared from my account without warning.</p>
<p>After discovering this, I contacted their customer support and described the issue as I'm describing it to you right now. I provided the transaction IDs for the withdrawal requests I made.</p>
<p>The customer support representative responded to me and said that my withdrawal requests were unsuccessful, but they could not tell me why.</p>
<p>The only thing the representative was able to tell me was this: "Kindly note that upon reviewing the account, we can confirm that the withdrawal requests for 3699.00 CAD and 1000.00 CAD has been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Although we cannot provide you with an exact reason, this will be sent to the relevant team for further review.</p>
<p>We do ask of you to allow time for feedback in this regard, once there is an update, you be notified via email directly."</p>
<p>I feel this is absolutely unacceptable. I am not provided a reason, or a timeframe, or even a notification that my winnings were taken under review. I followed the terms and conditions of the welcome offer.</p>
<p>After reading other people's experiences with Casigo on this website, I am getting worried.</p>
