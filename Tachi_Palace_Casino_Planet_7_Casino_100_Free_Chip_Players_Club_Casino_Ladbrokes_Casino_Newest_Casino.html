    <h1>Tachi Palace Casino Planet 7 Casino 100 Free Chip Players Club Casino Ladbrokes Casino Newest Casino</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela, I did the following:</p>
<p>I saw an offer for a no deposit bonus code for new players that was "WILDTIME" at casino guru for Wild Vegas Casino. I received the $ 60 bonus, and I was lucky to do the rollover which consisted of betting $ 1800.</p>
<p>Get the maximum profit allowed which is $ 100 with a lot of effort and many hours of dedication.</p>
<p>I think that if you let me exchange the voucher code at the cashier, in theory it should be valid for my country.</p>
<p>So I think that because of the bonus itself, it is because after talking to an administrator of the aforementioned casino, he showed me the terms and conditions of the casino and he told me that I could not redeem the winnings given my country of origin and I saw that It was true (in theory) because in the list of countries I saw that in Spain it put "No" in the column to exchange bonus without deposit.</p>
<p>I saw two key points in the terms and conditions, which are the one I mentioned above, to which the following must be added:</p>
<p>"You can contact us to appeal for any country-based restrictions. The Casino will evaluate your account and make the last call as appropriate."</p>
<p>So in theory appealing to the casino there is a possibility that although there is a restriction to redeem the bonus in my country, the casino has the last word.</p>
<p>And the other key point I saw is the following:</p>
<p>"Players from certain countries cannot withdraw money from free chip offers if they have not previously deposited. These players can participate in free chips for fun only."</p>
<p>This point can be interpreted in two ways as I think. It is in favor of the player and in favor of the casino because it is not specified clearly enough.</p>
<p>1st (In favor of the casino): That if I have not made a deposit before redeeming the bonus, I cannot redeem the winnings of the bonus without deposit and therefore the free chips are only for entertainment purposes.</p>
<p>2nd (In favor of the player): That if I have not yet made a previous deposit, I can still do it and redeem the winnings of the bonus without deposit and therefore the free chips can be redeemed and are not just for fun purposes.</p>
<p>On the basis that you have to be very lucky to profit from this bonus, there is someone here who has clearly been wrong in the sense that, if he could not profit from the bonus, at least before clearly warning the player that In your country there is a possibility that you cannot redeem the winnings of the bonus without deposit. Because as I mentioned, it takes a lot of effort and dedication to be able to profit from the bonus and hope in vain to at least get some benefit from this time spent to get some benefit. Because if it's for fun, all casinos have free chips to try their casino games before without investing real money ... And if it runs out, those free chips are re-entered.</p>
<p>This is a personal opinion: I think they don't lose much when it comes to giving that bonus money without deposit because they would attract many customers from different countries and that players see from the beginning without entering real money that they are legal casinos and pay their clients what they have "worked".</p>
<p>Answering the question he asked me about the country of origin: Yes, I am from Spain.</p>
<p>I tell you all this because I am annoyed at being deluded in vain when I could have been warned from the beginning without wasting time.</p>
<p>I am also dedicated to informing on the internet about how casinos behave and advising people whether they can trust a casino or not.</p>
<p>It's not really about the money, it's the least of it. But since I have achieved something that I consider very difficult and as it is written in the terms and conditions of the casino, I consider that there could be the possibility of appealing in favor of the player.</p>
<p>I like to fight for what is mine, and I defend my reason with arguments. I think you could help me with this and I would really appreciate it from me.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, greetings.</p>
