    <h1>Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Bally S Lake Tahoe Casino Resort Virginia Casinos Dreams Curacao Resort Spa</h1>

<p>I contacted MrVegas to encourage them to respond the complaint I raised and received the following email from Video slots their sister casino. I find it usual videoslots respond to complaints and MrVegas do not. In addition, security measures at VideoSlots seem to differ from MrVegas. Just thought I would share.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up to your previous request #3141757 "From Mr Vegas"</p>
<p>[EXTERNAL]</p>
<p>Please find attached a screen shot of the first page on March Bank statement. This is the same account as the January Bank Statement provided.</p>
<p>I have logged a complaint with Guru Casino, it would be appreciated if the gambling business responded. In addition, the UKGC have confirmed the account opened with MrVegas myself, which should not have accepted deposits without completing verification checks does fall under the UKGC due too the IP address being a UK IP address and therefore the gambling business has breached its licence condition. I would like the gambling business to do the right thing and refund all deposits.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
