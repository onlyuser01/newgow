<p>The online casino operator MrQ has enhanced its offerings, by implementing premium content by Red Tiger – a leading B2B supplier of online casino software.</p>
<p>MrQ Adds More Red Tiger Content to Its Offerings</p>
<p>Thanks to this deal, MrQ’s players can now play a variety of new exciting, atmospheric and thematic jackpot games. The latter can be found on MrQ’s platform under the new Daily Jackpots category where people can play critically-acclaimed iGaming titles such as Dynamite Riches, Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, and Reel King Mega.</p>
<p>The agreement is yet another strategic move on MrQ’s side. The operator has sought to partner with the best online gambling providers in order to engage its audience with a curated selection of high-quality iGaming titles. Red Tiger is recognized as one of the best in its craft and is a perfect match for MrQ.</p>
<p>Red Tiger is owned by Evolution Gaming Group and works alongside some of the best operators on the market thanks to its attractive suite of iGaming products and Daily Drop Jackpot network. The list of the provider’s partners includes BetMGM, Gamingtec, Finland’s Veikkaus, and Dazzletag among others.</p>
<p>The Two Are Looking Forward to Journeying Together</p>
<p>Red Tiger and MrQ have worked together previously, with the provider powering the operator’s live casino suite.</p>
<p>James Jones, the head of business development for Evolution Gaming, said that the company’s team is thrilled to expand its partnership with MrQ. He noted that he is excited by the opportunity to offer MrQ more than just live casino content and boost its offerings with Red Tiger’s suite of slot games and unique jackpot mechanics.</p>
<p>Jones is sure that the expanded relationship with MrQ is the start of a new journey for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Savvas Fellas, the founder of MrQ, lauded Red Tiger as an AAA content supplier and said that he is delighted to add it to the list of his company’s partners. He is looking forward to adding the provider’s great jackpot mechanics to MrQ.</p>
<p>Fellas noted that this partnership means that MrQ has now teamed up with all of Evolution’s studios.</p>
<p>“We have now completed the full Evolution suite of studios and look forward to seeing the partnership grow.” MrQ founder Savvas Fellas</p>
<p>For MrQ, this partnership means a strategic shift as the company continues seeking to explore innovative and varied betting products. The company was founded in 2018 and has quickly grown to become a force to be reckoned with thanks to its numerous partnerships with various providers.</p>
