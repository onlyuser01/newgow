<p>Caesars Sportsbook has become the official betting partner to both the Indy 500 and Indianapolis Motor Speedway with the company continuing to deliver on partnerships with racing organizaitons and properties. Moving forward, Caesars will be the official sponsors for the upcoming races that will take place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the year.</p>
<p>Teaming up with Motorsports in Indiana</p>
<p>The first event already took place on Saturday, May 14 with the GMR Grand Prix coinciding with the opening of the dedicated Caesars Sportsbook Lounge at Pagoda Plaza. Caesars is seeking to actively expand its presence in the regulated betting market and part of this has been teaming up with sports franchises, venues, and not least, event organizers.</p>
<p>To bolster its marketing, Caesars will have access to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s digital brand and intellectual property, including social media assets, logos, and more. Meanwhile, people who visit the property in person will benefit from the dedicated Caesars VIP experience which will be extended to people who love turning up to watch the races live. They will also benefit from the Caesars Rewards which will be available on-site. Commenting on this partnership Caesars Digital co-president Eric Hession said:</p>
<p>“The Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy 500 are iconic American sports traditions. Partnering with one of racing’s most iconic venues and ‘The Greatest Spectacle in Racing’ provides our customers with unique experiences through Caesars Rewards.” Caesars Digital co-president Eric Hession</p>
<p>Hession admitted that the opportunity to be teaming up with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway will be Caesars’ way to consolidate its presence in the state and with the local ecosystem. The company is committed to Indiana, he noted.</p>
<p>More Free Bets and Opportunities</p>
<p>The two partners will work on spreading marketing messages for each other products and running various program ads to push the Caesars Sportsbooks and bring more crowd on-site as well as on mobile. To celebrate the 106th Indy 500 due to take place on May 29, Caesars Sportsbook is already allocating as much as $106 in free bets.</p>
<p>This is not all as Indianapolis Motor Speedway president J. Douglas Boles was equally excited to welcome Caesars as the speedway’s partner. Boles admitted that the Speedway was “extremely excited” to be forging this partnership with the company and further work on the existing on-site tie-up with the company.</p>
<p>“This is another reason to look forward to an epic and historic Month of May at IMS.” Indianapolis Motor Speedway president J. Douglas Boles</p>
<p>This, Boles added, will give fans new opportunities for fans to connect with both racing but also have the opportunity to engage on a deeper level through sports betting.</p>
