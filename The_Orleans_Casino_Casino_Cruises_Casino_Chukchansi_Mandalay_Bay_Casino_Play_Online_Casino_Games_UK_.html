<p>The gambling regulator in the UK, the Gambling Commission, announced the launch of a new service that enables individuals to report criminal and suspicious activities online. Announced Monday, the new one-stop service enables users to submit an anonymous report. The service, the Commission said, is called “Tell us something in confidence,” and focuses primarily on suspicious gambling activities online.</p>
<p>The gambling watchdog explained that the Tell us something in confidence service is separate from its complaint services which allow users to file a complaint against a gambling business. While users can submit an anonymous complaint via the Tell us something in confidence service, they can also leave their details in case they want to be contacted further.</p>
<p>People can use the Commission’s new service to file reports for suspicious activities as well as unlicensed gambling or criminal activity. Moreover, users can submit reports for concerns related to money laundering, match fixing or suspected sports betting integrity issues. Last but not least, the Commission’s new service will also process reports for underage gambling, among other suspicious gambling activities online.</p>
<p>Users Can File a Report along with Additional Information</p>
<p>Besides reporting suspicious activities, users can submit related information. The Tell us something in confidence service enables the uploading of information such as documents and photographs. Moreover, customers can also submit such details via post or email, allowing for their report to contain robust information about the criminal or suspected illicit activity.</p>
<p>“The Gambling Commission has launched a new Tell us something in confidence service to make it easier to report criminal and suspicious activity anonymously online,“ reads a statement released by the Gambling Commission</p>
<p>The recently announced service comes at a time when the gambling sector in the UK is undergoing changes. Last month, the Commission released a new update, outlining its progress on improving gambling data collection. At the time, the gambling regulator confirmed that the collection of robust gambling data could help improve the regulatory framework in the country.</p>
<p>More recently, last week, the leading developer of iGaming content, Jelly Entertainment, announced it secured licenses from the gambling regulator in the UK and the Malta Gaming Authority. The company confirmed that it was “very pleased” with the announcement, explaining that it will be able to continue growing its European footprint.</p>
