<p>Philadelphia Determined to Bounce Back Straight Away</p>
<p>There’s no longer a single NFL team that has a 100% win record in 2022. It’s because Philadelphia suffered its first loss of the season last weekend. The Eagles suffered a 32-21 defeat to the Washington Commanders at home.</p>
<p>The loss came as a huge surprise given the fact that Philly’s players have been terrific in 2022. Does this mean they’re tired of playing their best football?</p>
<p>The momentum probably isn’t over, but some of Philadelphia’s players definitely looked sluggish against Washington. This goes especially for those in the Eagles’ defense, who simply were unable to do anything against the Commanders’ wide receiver Terry McLaurin.</p>
<p>They need to improve their passing defense in the future, but that shouldn’t worry them much in the Indianapolis game. Why? Because the Colts’ strongest weapon in 2022 is rushing.</p>
<p>Indy’s Key Men are Back From Injury</p>
<p>Quarterback Matt Ryan made his comeback from injury last weekend, leading his team to a 25-20 win over the Raiders. He threw for one touchdown, as well as scored one rushing TD on his own. Speaking of rushing, running back Jonathan Taylor was superb in that game as well.</p>
<p>He too had some annoying problems with injuries recently, but he’s back now and he’s playing great. We saw him make a 66-yard TD run against the Raiders, which we think of as a preview of what he’s going to do in the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>With these two playing top football, the Colts fans have every right to dream big. This team’s chance of making the playoffs is 29% but it can skyrocket if they beat the Eagles on Sunday.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs Indianapolis Colts Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are great when it comes to rushing. Neither team is great when it comes to rushing defense. That said, we think that the winner of the Eagles vs Colts game will be the team that has better runners. So, what is the answer?</p>
<p>We say Indianapolis! And it’s mostly because of Jonathan Taylor. He’s arguably the best running back in the league who was the NFL’s rushing yards (1,811) and TDs (18) leader last season. This season, he’s played just one game, but his numbers were more than decent.</p>
<p>Taylor made 21 carries for 78 yards and one touchdown, and we think he’s gonna do even better this coming Sunday. As a result, his team should do well against Philly, possibly even winning the game. Still, we do think the best bet is that they’re not going to lose by more than seven points.</p>
<p>Picks: Indianapolis Colts +6.5; over to hit</p>
