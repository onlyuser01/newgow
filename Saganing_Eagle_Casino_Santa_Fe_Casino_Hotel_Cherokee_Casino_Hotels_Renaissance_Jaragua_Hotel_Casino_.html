<p>Olympic Entertainment Group’s sports betting brand, OlyBet, has become the latest member of the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), a body that is committed to tackling betting fraud and manipulation by leveraging the combined effort of its sprawling network of global partners.</p>
<p>OlyBet is a prominent company in the European betting market and it has secured a number of prominent partnerships, including with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the NationalBasketball Association (NBA), covering specifically the Baltic region.</p>
<p>As such, OlyBet has been on a dedicated mission to ensure that its market is free and that it leverages its expertise to assist audiences in better understanding the risks of betting manipulation. Far more importantly, however, OlyBet wants to put its trading expertise into helping regulators and global organizations such as IBIA better home in on signals of fraud and manipulation.</p>
<p>OlyBet itself now joins a list of dozens of companies from the sector that have been working tirelessly to secure the safest possible betting environment for all. IBIA CEO Khalid Ali has welcomed the arrival of the latest operator and brand and said that OlyBet is truly a company that brings a lot of expertise and understanding.</p>
<p>"We intend to work closely with OlyBet to harness that important regional knowledge base to protect our global network from corrupt betting practices linked to match-fixing," Ali said. He argued that OlyBet’s decision to join was the right call and one that would only strengthen IBIA’s own ability to help with boosting global sports integrity.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Olympic Entertainment Group and OlyBet Group CEO and Chairman Corey Plummer who said that this was an important step forward for the company – and the industry – in defending sports betting against criminals and corruption on every level.</p>
<p>It’s through the seminal work of professionals such as IBIA that sports fans can rest assured that the level of regulated market match manipulations is going down and will disappear Plummer argued in his own approval of the partnership. IBIA has been fast-expanding with a number of important moves over the past years.</p>
<p>The association has also been responding to big changes in global markets homing in on particular jurisdictions that are experiencing big changes such as South America and North America. IBIA has been actively strengthening its presence in both and looking to help add more legitimate operators that can help it to tackle corruption once and for all. For the time being, though, this is an ongoing process that requires the concentrated effort of all.</p>
