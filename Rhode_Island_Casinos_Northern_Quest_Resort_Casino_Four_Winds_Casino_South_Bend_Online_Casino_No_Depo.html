    <h1>Rhode Island Casinos Northern Quest Resort Casino Four Winds Casino South Bend Online Casino No Depo</h1>

<p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>thank you for your message and your questions - please find the answers below.</p>
<p>When did you request for the deposit bonus?</p>
<p>As I already had bad experiences with this casino's attitude to fulfill his promises and stand its back, the steps for claiming each bonus I follow are these:</p>
<p>go to live chat &amp; find out, if the bonus is available for me</p>
<p>if yes, find out, if the operator is able to add the bonus manually if something fails</p>
<p>if yes, THEN making the deposit</p>
<p>This way it's possible to avoid 99% misunderstandings and ineligible bonuses. As I got only positive answers from support here, I went for depositing - however, even such steps are not enough in case that the casino workers are just peasants, free to talk anything, and later just changing their stances, or simply lying from the beginning.</p>
<p>Background: This 100% bonus has been available for my account long time ago, permanently, without time limitation and as I have proven in the screenshots, I have also been receiving it many times before.</p>
<p>How long after that did the casino e-mailed you that it is now resolved?</p>
<p>Casino emailed me only once in this regard and I have already sent you the screenshot of this email. It was in the moment, when Anna first added me the wrong bonus, then claimed to escalate the issue and then later she emailed me this:</p>
<p>"...we created a bonus code to claim your 64 euros bonus this time. You can redeem the bonus by entering the bonus code SPECIALFORYOU on your dashboard page. Please note that this code last only today and is only eligible for 1 time. We are sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience..."</p>
<p>One would say that the bonus will be of a different type (the correct one) after this, wouldn't he? However - first, the code was unable to be claimed at all ðŸ˜€ and second, after I asked to be claimed manually, it appears to be just the same wrong type like before. I consider this either large communication black hole, or simply making fun and jokes of the customers.</p>
<p>Did you played with the deposited amount or the no deposit bonus provided by the casino or your balance is still since your deposit?</p>
<p>No, both are gone - the deposited amount has been spent playing; bonus amount I cancelled myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it does not actually matter what happened to them ðŸ™‚ I describe the details below.</p>
<p>Why have I played the deposited amount?</p>
<p>As I did exactly what I described in my answer to your first question above, I believe it was deserved to be able to play right after the deposit, not needing to wait until the casino resolves its issues (which I questioned before and they assured that the solution is instant and simple; it just turned out not to be).</p>
<p>Therefore, after I deposited and found out that I am not getting the bonus right away, I requested to be able at LEAST to play with deposit, and to get the bonus credited later, manually (casinos often say "is not technically possible" or alike; 99% of casinos claiming this are just lying - it definitely IS possible. Maybe just not from a clerk with least access level to the system. ðŸ™‚ even THIS casino added me several custom compensations after lost complaint, just without any problem)</p>
<p>On my question if I can play with the deposit before the bonus is added, the only thing support reminded me of was that the amount of bets I make before the bonus addition won't be count into the bonus wagering.</p>
<p>If that is the only of the cons.. I would be OK with that.</p>
<p>Why have I cancelled the bonus?</p>
<p>After all the problems and complications and declining attitude from the casino I had chat with one of the support representatives. He has been in touch allegedly with the bonus team; during our chat the bonus team showed zero will and did not even showed a try to find any solution fitting us both or anyhow to change its stance, keeping its absolutist decision. Also, the employee during this chat asked me if "i cannot just play the bonus out" and maybe the correct bonus appears after this one is lost.</p>
<p>So, I cancelled the current bonus as there is no point of having a bonus that 1) anyone can add you again, anytime; 2) you cannot win anything from; and 3) that, based on the support, maybe also "hides" the bonus you actually want.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
