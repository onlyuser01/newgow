    <h1>Casinos In Montreal Quebec Oneida Casino Green Bay Casino Near Charlotte Nc Online Casino Sign Up Bo</h1>

<p>Rivalry continues on its expansion trajectory in 2022 with the company now officially launching sports and esports betting products in Australia. This is a first for the gambling agency which promises to revolutionize how we experience every segment of the betting experience. Rivalry has already accepted its first deposits in the country and is preparing to go live in Ontario, Canada in June.</p>
<p>Rivalry Rolls Australian Operations with First Bets Coming In</p>
<p>The Australian launch came after the obtaining of a license from the Northern Territory Racing Commission. Rivalry has cleared a number of prerequisites, making it the first endemic esports brand to launch legally in the country. While Rivalry’s offer has evolved to include brand new experiences since its original esports-first launch, the company remains committed to competitive gaming through and through.</p>
<p>Rivalry co-founder and CEO Steven Salz welcomed the launch and said that the entire company was thrilled to be joining the country and bringing its product to the Down Under. His statement read:</p>
<p>“We take a very different approach than traditional betting operators, and have been particularly successful among Gen Z and young Millennial’s across the globe. We are very eager to start building our brand equity in Australia through a series of innovative activations and campaigns as we ramp up services throughout the remainder of 2022.” Rivalry co-founder and CEO Steven Salz</p>
<p>Rivalry to Get Big Boost from Canadian &amp; Australian Launches</p>
<p>The launch comes on the tail of the company’s strongest results to date with Rivalry committing to scale its operations and explore new market. The company has already secured a license in Ontario and is calibrating its launch as two companies in the province already received penalties for marketing campaigns breaching local regulations.</p>
<p>Rivalry will focus on both its esports and sports betting product in equal measure with its Australian launch. The second-quarter results will definitely receive a boost owing to the two big rollouts for the company.</p>
