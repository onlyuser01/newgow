<p>Play’n GO, one of the world’s most renowned iGaming content creators, has secured a B2B license in Michigan and thus, successfully entered the US market. The studio greeted the achievement and noted that it plans to expand across multiple states in the country.</p>
<p>Players Will Be Able to Enjoy Some of the World’s Most Popular Games</p>
<p>Thanks to the license approval, Play’n GO will be able to supply its partners in Michigan with some of the most popular online slots on the market. That includes the likes of Legacy of Dead, Book of Dead, Reactoonz, Riche Wild series, Rise of Olympus, Shimmering Woods, Lord Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, Ice Joker, etc.</p>
<p>Johan Törnqvist, the CEO of Play’n GO, shared a few words on the development. He stated that the supplier believes that it is in a unique position “to succeed in the US.” He also added that Play’n GO has always kept track of the latest trends and the fact that it created and supplied mobile games before mobile gaming experienced such a massive boom in popularity is a true testament to the claim.</p>
<p>As for the company’s goals in the US, Törnqvist said that he hopes that Play’n GO’s games become as loved as they are across the other regulated markets where Play’n GO operates.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the fact that it will take time for the supplier to complete this mission but stated that Play’n GO is “absolutely committed” to expanding across the country.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Has Had an Active Year So Far</p>
<p>So far, 2022 has been nothing short but amazing for Play’n GO. The supplier was pretty active in supplying its casino partners with new games. In total, Play’n GO released 27 premium games. Some of the latest releases include Rotiki, Merlin’s Grimoire, NSYNC Pop, Cat Wilde and the Pyramids of Dead, as well as Wild Trigger.</p>
<p>Additionally, Play’n GO expanded in Italy via NetBet and the move was praised by NetBet’s Italy manager, Claudia Georgevici, who acknowledged the fact that Play’n GO is a player-favorite content provider and the addition of the supplier’s products on NetBet’s platform is yet another step in the operator’s efforts into providing its players with the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the content creator held its second Play’n SHOW. The event took place in the La Reserva club in Sotogrande, Spain and was hosted by Stuart Trigwell, who was joined on stage by George Olekszy (games ambassador) and Magnus Olsson (CEO).</p>
<p>While speaking at the event, Olsson thanked the crowd, which included guests from both Gibraltar and Spain, and stated that the purpose of the evening was to strengthen the relationship with every attendee. During the Play’n SHOW event, various entertaining sessions were held in terms of how to utilize Play’n GO’s content and ensure success over the long term.</p>
