<p>The fourth LPGA major is upon us, with the competitive action quickly shifting to Europe and the Evian Championship promising to be every bit as entertaining as the previous events. Today, we take a look at the Evian Championship odds, which will feature no shortage of talent as some of the top female golfers are coming in for the event.</p>
<p>Once again, Nelly Korda is given a slight edge by sportsbooks, who post her at (+900), but she is followed tightly by Jin Young Ko at (+1000). The difference between the first four players is almost too insignificant to matter, with a lot riding on the event. Let’s take a look at the odds.</p>

<p>Predictions: Who Will Win the LPGA Evian Championship in 2021?</p>
<p>With the exception of Lydia Ko and Jin Young Ko, there don’t seem to be any recent winners competing today in the Top 10 golfers who have the best chances of securing this year’s edition.</p>
<p>Mo Martin is outside the first 10 in terms of chances of winning, but she currently leads the Tour and has placed highest in all past events combined. Overall, the LPGA Tour has been interesting to behold as the past five events proving very contentious with no clear favorite emerging.</p>
<p>The difference in performance has to do with the differences in courses and what a player’s native playing field usually is. The Evian Resort Golf Club is located next to Lake Geneva, with a lot of greens strewn across the field, making it easy for a golfer to err and land a ball in the lush vegetation.</p>
<p>Jin Young Ko is definitely a strong claimant to the title, having had over 10 Top-6 finishers this season. Nelly Korda emerged victorious in both the Women’s PGA Championship and Meijer LPGA Classic in June.</p>
<p>Her playstyle, determination, and current ranking make her a strong contender for winning in the upcoming event. Hyo Joo Kim has had a few good runs of her own, not exactly winning, but applying a lot of pressure, and she is one of the underdogs to look out for during this event as well.</p>
