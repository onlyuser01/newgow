<p>DraftKings and Bally’s Corporation secured market access in Kansas through agreements with the subsidiary of Butler National Corporation that manages Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort in Dodge City.</p>
<p>Awaiting Regulatory Approvals</p>
<p>The agreements Butler National, a leader in special mission aircraft modifications and provider of gaming industry professional management services, signed with Boston-based DraftKings and Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corporation mean any eligible aged Kansas resident will be able to place legal online or mobile bets as soon as Kansas officially launches sports wagering.</p>
<p>“We worked diligently to find partners that would bring Kansans a seamless, safe and premium sports betting experience. We are ready to work with DraftKings and Bally’s to make sports wagering available in Kansas.” Clark Stewart, CEO, Butler National Corporation</p>
<p>Stewart also expressed his hopes to have mobile wagering up and running by the football season and the retail location by this fall, seeking to “drive tourism and revenue for the State of Kansas by giving guests “another exciting reason to visit Dodge City.”</p>
<p>Following Governor Laura Kelly’s signature on the sports betting bill on May 12, Kansas is set to have legal sports betting effective July 1. As manager of state-owned Boot Hill Casino, Butler National is allowed to partner with up to three sports wagering platforms, as well as open a retail sportsbook at the casino, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>‘World-Class Sports Betting Experience’</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement with Butler National, Griffin Finan, VP Government Affairs, Associate General Counsel for DraftKings, outlined the opportunity for DraftKings to enter Kansas following the passage of the bill and partner with Boot Hill Casino to engage with state residents and provide them with a “world-class sports betting experience.”</p>
<p>On behalf of Bally’s Corporation, Adi Dhandhania, Bally’s Interactive’s chief operating officer of North America, was pleased to see Kansas join “an increasing number of states across the nation” and legalize sports betting, looking forward to collaborating with Boot Hill Casino to “bring the Bally’s online gaming experience to Kansans.”</p>
<p>While waiting for the final approvals from the Kansas Lottery, Boot Hill Casino is already planning for the changes to accommodate the upcoming new gaming experience and expand its offering to patrons.</p>
<p>“We are eager to move forward with our partners to bring legal, safe sports betting to historic Dodge City, Kansas,” said Boot Hill Casino’s general manager Diane Giardine.</p>
<p>The $90 million Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort opened in 2009 and currently features over 500 electronic gaming machines, 14 table games, a casual dining restaurant with 150 seats, as well as lottery facility games owned and operated by the Kansas Lottery.</p>
