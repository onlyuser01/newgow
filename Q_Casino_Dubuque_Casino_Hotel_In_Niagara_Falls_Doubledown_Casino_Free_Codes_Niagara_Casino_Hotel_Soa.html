    <h1>Q Casino Dubuque Casino Hotel In Niagara Falls Doubledown Casino Free Codes Niagara Casino Hotel Soa</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your efforts in bringing your concerns to our attention. We understand the importance of addressing complaints promptly and seriously, and we have initiated a thorough investigation into the unfortunate incident you experienced.</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing your case, we have determined that there may have been some misunderstanding regarding the information provided in your complaint. It appears that the issue arose while you were availing yourself of our seasonal promotion called "Hey, it's May Day!" rather than our standard welcome package bonus, as was mentioned earlier. Our system data indicates that you had active participation in this particular promotion, which has specific terms and requirements, including a maximum bet limit of 3 euros.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that at the moment, all "match" bonuses are given out with a maximum bet of €3. If it is only free spins - the bet can be increased to €5. But this particular bonus has the following parameters:</p>
<p>70% bonus</p>
<ul>
<li>70 free spins</li>
</ul>
<p>Wager X10</p>
<p>Minimum deposit 30 euros</p>
<p>Maximum bet €3</p>
<p>The maximum amount of the bonus is 300 euros</p>
<p>Additionally, we would like to thank our opponents from Casino Guru for pointing out to:</p>
<p>"4.2. The maximum bet with an active first and second deposit bonus is €5. Max bet allowed with other bonuses can differ.»</p>
<p>In our opinion, this particular rule plays a key role in this case, as it clearly says that the max bet with other bonuses might differ, which is clearly what has happened in this case.</p>
<p>To provide further clarity, here is a brief summary of the actions taken with the «Hey, it's May Day!» bonus active:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On 2023-04-28 at 03:29:51, you made a deposit of 40 EUR to activate the promotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 2023-04-28 at 03:30:43, you activated your 70 free spins in the game Moon Princess 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 2023-04-28 at 03:32:07, you began fulfilling the bonus wagering requirement by playing various casino games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 2023-04-28 at 03:43:22, you exceeded the maximum allowed bet by placing a 4 EUR bet in the game Book of Sam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 2023-04-28 at 06:32:05, you completed the wagering requirement. However, as per our terms and conditions, your winnings were voided due to the aforementioned bet violation, and your initial deposit of 40 EUR was refunded to your player account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to confirm that our decision regarding your case was made in accordance with our Terms &amp; Conditions. While it is important to note that exceeding the maximum bet is considered as bonus abuse, we have taken the fair step of fully refunding your deposit as a gesture of goodwill. Furthermore, we have escalated your situation to our Loyalty Department, resulting in an additional compensation of 100 Euros in wager-free bonus funds being credited to your account. These actions were taken despite the violation of our Terms &amp; Conditions, as we believe it to be the most suitable resolution for this unfortunate situation for our clients, regardless of their actions in such cases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we extend our gratitude once again for your time and for bringing your concerns to our attention. We hope that the information provided clarifies the situation for both you and our opponents at Casino Guru. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support team at your convenience.</p>
<p>Attached are two screenshots:</p>
<p>1) promo email to the players with information about the bonus</p>
<p>2) screenshot from the website with bonus conditions</p>
<p>You can find the email with this bonus in your mailbox and make sure our bonus policy is completely transparent, and there are no hidden conditions.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Andrei</p>
