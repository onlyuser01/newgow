    <h1>Lake Worth Casino Free Money No Deposit Casino 7 Clan Casino Mardi Gras Casino West Virginia Casino</h1>

<p>The powerful international aggregator has added the innovative product by Livespins to offer even more diverse experiences to its network partners</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS is a platform provider for online gaming businesses and it also features a powerful aggregation platform that allows operators to tap directly into compliance-ready and player-favorite games. Thanks to this new tie-up with Livespins, the company will be able to significantly strengthen the quality of the products it offers and give potential partners an incentive to onboard with SOFTSWISS.</p>
<p>Livespins Brings Brand New Type of Entertainment</p>
<p>This is owing to Livespins’ unique proposition that brings streamers and players closer together. The way Livespins operates is completely groundbreaking in the iGaming industry. Essentially, players tune in to watch streamers play in real time. Players may just watch, but they can also participate by betting on every round with the streamer.</p>
<p>In other words, streamers and viewers bet together – but not completely. Streamers usually place huge amounts to keep people entertained. Livespins allows viewers to choose their own sizes and never break their banks participating in the betting. Livespins is integrated directly through the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform which will make it a ready-baked and easy-to-integrate solution with partner casinos.</p>
<p>The seamless integration cuts the downtime for partners and allows them to jump straight into play. SOFTSWISS Head of Casino Platform Darya Avtukhovich said that the company was very pleased to see this partnership shape up between the two companies:</p>
<p>The Livespins integration is a step forward in line with our strategic vision of incorporating gamification elements into the betting process on our SOFTSWISS Casino Platform. SOFTSWISS Head of Casino Platform Darya Avtukhovich</p>
<p>Avtukhovich said that her company was very motivated to deliver only the best and most worthwhile games for its players, and the addition of Livespins is a step in that direction.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Continues to Evolve Its Product Offering</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has been able to achieve a number of excellent milestones over the past months, with the company hitting several benchmarks including going live with launching its Jackpot Aggregator with more than 50 online gambling businesses and delivering stronger player retention and engagement.</p>
<p>Livespins has also been shopping around for more partners, hoping to elevate its experience and considerably strengthen what it brings to the iGaming table. The company has signed a content partnership with REEVO, an aggregation platform. Livespins has also pursued individual operator integrations and launches such as its most recent partnership with M88 Mansion.</p>
