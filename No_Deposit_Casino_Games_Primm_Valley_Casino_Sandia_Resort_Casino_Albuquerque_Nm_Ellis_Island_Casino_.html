<p>Developer of video and premium casino games Gaming Corps announced today a new partnership with Glitnor Group to offer its gaming content via the group’s subsidiary brands Lucky Casino and Gambola.</p>
<p>‘Grow from Strength to Strength’</p>
<p>The addition of one of the fastest growing gaming operators in Europe, Glitnor Group, to the roster of Gaming Corps’ partners will see a portfolio of the developer, as well as some custom branded games, distributed via Glitnor’s online casino brands Lucky Casino and Gambola.</p>
<p>Speaking on the announcement, Danielle Calafato, head of Commercial at Gaming Corps, outlined how pleased he felt to see “Glitnor Group grow from strength to strength,” having followed the company’s “truly impressive” development in such a short time.</p>
<p>“This is a company going places and on behalf of all of us at Gaming Corps we are very excited to be part of that journey. We will do our best to deliver modern content and meet the demands of the Glitnor Group casino players.” Danielle Calafato, Head of Commercial, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>Engagement with ‘High-Quality Partners’</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by a group of industry veterans, Glitnor Group operates predominantly across online casino markets in Sweden, Finland and Japan. Based in Malta and boasting over 350 employees across its headquarters and Bulgarian office, the operator strives to be the most entrepreneurial and fastest growing business group in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>“Glitnor Group’s vision is to become a global leader on the iGaming market and that ambition requires for us to engage high-quality partners along the way,” said Martin Sidenvall, Head of Casino at Glitnor Group, outlining that the new partnership will help the operator provide its customers with “a stellar player experience.”</p>
<p>With strong ambitions to take the global leadership and change the competitive landscape across studios, operators and lead generation, Glitnor Group will utilize some custom branded games from Gaming Corps for its flagship brand Lucky Casino.</p>
<p>Entering the Lead Generation Space</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Glitnor acquired iGaming affiliate business KaFe Rocks to announce its entry into the online gambling lead generation space. The Malta-based affiliate was seen as the perfect complement to Glitnor’s roster of B2C brands Lucky Casino and Gambola and B2B content supplier Swintt.</p>
<p>In May, Glitnor doubled down on lead generation by investing a “seven-figure” sum in another North American affiliate business, Time2Play.com, as part of the KaFe Rocks’ acquisition.</p>
