    <h1>Hotels Near Soaring Eagle Casino Sf Casino Hollywood Casino Dayton Ohio Casino In Battle Creek Michi</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I have a problem with Mond Casino. Yesterday I deposited 100 Euro and I used the bonus for the 2nd deposit by entering the appropriate code. I got a 50 Euro bonus. Then I played until I met the spin requirement, which was 3750 Euro. Quite soon I won and my balance increased above 600 Euro, but I completed the whole conditions, while my balance after the spin was 454.6 Euro. So I asked for a selection. Today I received an email, part of which (thanks to the word limit - I can forward the entire email if I am interested) I will copy:</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>If the Player uses such strategies, and if the Casino has sufficient grounds to believe that the Player's actions are aimed solely to obtain financial benefits using the bonus advantage, then the Casino reserves the right to cancel all Player's winnings.</p>
<p>A list of what may be deemed as bonus abuse may include but is not limited to: Equal, zero or low margin bets; Manipulation of software, exploitation of loopholes or other technical forms of abuse or other behavior which amounts to deliberate cheating; Increasing the balance and then changing Your gaming pattern significantly (bet, game type, bet structure or other pattern of betting) to complete any wagering requirements of any Bonus; Using any betting system or placing even money bets on any game of chance, and / or Making bets for higher values (between 2 € and 4 €) continuously and then after get a big wins change to lower bets (lower for more than 20% of your inital bet); Using the "Double-Up" or "Buy Free Spins functions" or gamble feature within a game to increase win values; Increasing your balance after placing high value bets and thereafter proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior bet value, in order to meet bonus wagering requirements; Wagering on Games that do not contribute towards wagering requirements or games with a 0% wagering weight applied to them as specified in the specific bonus landing page terms; Wagering on games with bonus money to build up value, lose the bonus and then cash out on the built up value with a secondary deposit.</p>
<p>Please note, upon checking your recent gameplay, we have concluded your gaming pattern does not fall into a category of genuine recreation players, therefore we have to act in compliance with out Bonus Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>10.1.8 Bonuses offered by Mondcasino are only intended for genuine recreational players. Abuse of the offered bonuses will not be tolerated. Mondcasino reserves the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if abuse of the bonus is only being suspected at its sole discretion without need for further explanation. In case of suspected abuse, all bonuses and subsequent gaming activity and wins will be revoked and annulled and the deposit is returned.</p>
<p>We have decided to revoke your bonus eligibility and retract your winnings generated with the help of our bonuses. We have left your initial deposits on your balance, intact.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>I checked my account and my withdrawal was canceled, while the balance in the casino account is 100 Euro, ie 354.6 Euro less. If I understand correctly, the casino writes that I have violated the bonus conditions. However, the bonus I received was 50 Euros, while my withdrawal was 354.6 Euros. My balance never fell below 50 Euros, ie I did not even play with bonus money, and if I violated something, I would consider it fair to withdraw the original amount of the bonus, ie 50 Euros. To be honest, I didn't read the bonus terms before playing. So I thought I had violated these terms, so after receiving the email, I read the entire terms and conditions in detail. After reading all the prohibitions described in the email in detail, I can't find what exactly I violated, I think and I believe I didn't do any of it.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, I deposited 100 Euros, which is more than 20 Euros (minimum to get a bonus). Then I played the "Marching Legions" slot machine, where I bet 2 Euros on the spin. I have not played any other game such as roulette, card games or banned games. I fulfilled the whole requirement for the bet and I did not change the amount of the bet (the maximum allowed bet is in the conditions of 4 Euros).</p>
<p>If I understand the email and the conditions well (condition 10.1.8.), The casino has the right to cancel the winnings in the case of a bonus game at any time without explanation. But if such conditions are legal, then I think they are very unfair, especially if the casino not only takes away the bonus but all the winnings (the casino can, for example, credit 1 Euro bonus, and if the player wins, cancels everything and if the player loses, game valid). For example, I used the bonus for the first deposit I lost.</p>
<p>So I want to ask, is there any chance of winning (at least without the 50 Eur bonus) or is the chance at this casino due to condition 10.1.8 zero? If the chance is zero, it would be advisable to alert other players to this fact, because in my opinion most players do not read the conditions and if I knew about this condition, I would never play at this casino.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Miroslav P ***</p>
