<p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority is not slowing down as it seeks to restrict the access of every remaining rogue gambling website to its shores. The message the regulator sends is clear – if you don’t have a license, don’t even try.</p>
<p>After culling hundreds of brands, the watchdog is back with a list of 11 offshore gambling websites which have received an internet service provider (ISP) ban, a rather tough practice that has become the regulator’s signature move.</p>
<p>The latest to have been handed down a stiff penalty for breaching the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 include Parimatchwin, Casino Rocket, Robin Roo, Lucky Tiger Casino, Bitkingz, Jackpot Jill VIP, Cabarino, Montecryptos, Megaslot, Pokie Island, and Rich Palms. All of these brands were offering gambling products illegally, a statement by the company read.</p>
<p>This has rounded up the number of blocked websites to 555. ACMA began blocking websites back in 2019. Many industry observers expressed doubt about whether such a strategy can actually yield any meaningful results, but they now stand corrected.</p>
<p>Admittedly, ACMA had to begin understanding the illegal gambling market better and collate evidence about wrongdoing before issuing this measure. However, the regulator has proven persistent in its responsibilities and duties, making sure that Australians’ access to rogue websites is mostly limited.</p>
<p>ACMA was also able to scare at least 170 other brands into withdrawing from the market voluntarily. This was done after the regulator said it would pursue action with overseas counterparts and inform said websites about their unlawful operations in Australia.</p>
<p>"Website blocking provides a valuable opportunity to alert the public to illegal gambling services through the messaging that appears when there is an attempt to access the site," the regulator said in an official statement during its latest update.</p>
<p>ACMA cautioned that many of these websites presented themselves aslegitimate services – some may even hold licenses in other jurisdictions. However, this did not exempt those websites from the fact that they had no actual license to do business in Australia and did so in a manner that was not lawful.</p>
<p>ACMA has been inexorable in making sure that websites are banned if they break the country’s gambling laws. It most recently took out thepokies.net, billed as the biggest such operator. Meanwhile, regulatory actions have continued in both June and May, and before that.</p>
