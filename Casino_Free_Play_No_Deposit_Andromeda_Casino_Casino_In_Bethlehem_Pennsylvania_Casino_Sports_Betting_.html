    <h1>Casino Free Play No Deposit Andromeda Casino Casino In Bethlehem Pennsylvania Casino Sports Betting</h1>

<p>Hello! On 16 october 2023 I won 5758 USDT and after this I tried to withdraw 3758 USDT. After waiting for more than 8 hours I started to be nervous and withdrew 2000 USDT(To the same address, I used one address for withdrawals and didn't change it). After 30 minutes they withdrew my 2000 USDT but the other part was blocked with an error "Audit failure". (2000 usdt it was the sum of my last deposits)</p>
<p>I contacted support and they asked me to do KYC. So I tried to apply my ID card, but I got a failed result. I contacted support and they gave me another try. I tried to apply my car license. I got a failed result. I contacted support again and they gave me another try. I uploaded my Foreign Passport, but I got a failed result again. I decided to write to their email support (support@bc.game). I described my problem and I asked to verify my KYC manually. So they answered me pretty quickly as a result they approved my KYC, but to enable the withdrawal function(I tried to withdraw but I got a pop up message that it's disabled) I was forced to pass Proof of address. So, I opened my bank app and made a fresh bank statement in english. I uploaded it to the verification form, but as it was with my personal documents I got a failed result. I again wrote to support in order to tell them the problem, but they just simply gave me another try. I tried again to upload(I made a new statement) and they declined again. So, I decided to write to email support. I asked them to do what they did with my KYC 1 level and I attached my bank statement to the email. They told me that they don't do that.</p>
<p>After several days, I came back to the site and noticed that I logged out, I tried to log in but it said "Account requires verification". I wrote to live chat support and they told me that I need to send some information to the email support. I filled the information and sent it to email support. They haven't answered me in 2 weeks, since my first message to them about this problem. So I decided to write from another email and they answered me in less than 5 hours. They simply blocked my email and don't answer. Live chat says that I need to wait bla bla bla.</p>
<p>I've attached some proofs of my words. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
