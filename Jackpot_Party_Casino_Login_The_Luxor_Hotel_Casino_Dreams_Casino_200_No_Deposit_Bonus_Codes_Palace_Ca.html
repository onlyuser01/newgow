<p>Germany lottery operator ZEAL Network announced it appointed Rodja Schmitz-Hübsch as its Vice President of Marketing in October to optimize customer engagement.</p>
<p>New Customer Acquisition and Customer Retention</p>
<p>New VP of Marketing Schmitz-Hübsch will report directly to ZEAL chief operational officer Sönke Martens on his responsibilities related to the development of the company’s marketing strategy, as well as the optimization of new customer acquisition and customer relationship management.</p>
<p>Commenting on his new role, Schmitz-Hübsch expressed how eagerly he anticipates to begin working on his new tasks at ZEAL, believing that a business that has already paid out more than €200 million in winnings this year is a marketer’s dream, making the job easy by marketing itself.</p>
<p>“ZEAL has made an impressive development with the portals LOTTO24 and Tipp24,” Schmitz-Hübsch added, convinced that he and the team at ZEAL “will continue to write this success story and consistently pave the way for further growth in marketing.”</p>
<p>New VP of Marketing Schmitz-Hübsch boasts a working experience across marketing gained at online marketplace OTTO where he served as Head of Campaigns, as well as in multiple roles – Managing Partner being the most recent one – for digital creative agency elbdudler.</p>
<p>ZEAL chief operating officer Sönke Martens outlined the new addition as “a renowned marketing manager,” hailing his “deep expertise in brand management and e-commerce.”</p>
<p>“Today, more than ever, a professional marketing strategy is crucial for companies to succeed,” Martens continued, pleased to welcome on board “a true professional” like Schmitz-Hübsch, who is certain to contribute to the business with his “experience and passion for good marketing” and establish himself as “an important driver for the further growth at ZEAL.”</p>
<p>Continuous Customer Improvements</p>
<p>Dedicated to its customers, ZEAL Network is continuously seeking new ways to improve their lottery experience and safety by implementing the latest technology and artificial intelligence (AI) achievements.</p>
<p>In June and July this year, ZEAL Network teamed with two AI-implementing solutions providers, Mindway AI and Nect, respectively, to improve the safety of its customers.</p>
<p>From the partner of online casinos and sportsbooks, Mindway AI, the provider of online lottery games utilized algorithms and its GameScanner to gain insights into the behavior of its consumers, while the AI-based identity verification tech provided by Nect sought to ensure minors do not participate in the lottery games.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, ZEAL Network released a trading update to reveal a strong third quarter for the business and a double-digit increase in year-to-date revenue.</p>
