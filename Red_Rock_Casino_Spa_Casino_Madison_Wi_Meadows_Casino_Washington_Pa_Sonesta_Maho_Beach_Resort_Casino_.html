    <h1>Red Rock Casino Spa Casino Madison Wi Meadows Casino Washington Pa Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino</h1>

<p>Data shows that the majority of the reported revenue was generated by the casino vertical, which includes slots, bingo and table games</p>
<p>Ontario’s iGaming market remains stable as demonstrated by the market’s unaudited second quarter results. Data from iGaming Ontario shows that players in the Canadian province have wagered a total of $14.2 billion (around USD 10.4 billion) during the period, not counting any promotional wagers and bonuses.</p>
<p>For reference, this number represents a slight growth from Q1 when the industry recorded $14 billion in wagers.</p>
<p>The $14.2 billion wagers resulted in a total gaming revenue of $540 million (approximately USD 397 million), representing a slight decrease from Q1 when the gaming revenue sat at $545 million. This figure includes total cash wagers and does not take into account operating costs and other expenses.</p>
<p>Further data shows that the majority of the reported revenue was generated by the casino vertical, which includes slots, bingo and table games. Casino gaming accounted for $11.9 billion of the total wagers in the Canadian province and $407 million of the total gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The sports betting vertical, meanwhile, saw players wager $1.9 billion. This, in turn, resulted in revenue of $118 million. Lastly, the peer-to-peer poker vertical accounted for $397 million in wagers and $16 million in gaming revenue.</p>
<p>There Were 943K Active Accounts</p>
<p>The reported figures reflect the business of Ontario’s 47 legal operators and 71 gambling websites. iGaming Ontario also reported that there were 943,000 active accounts during the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>The agency clarified that “active accounts” are all accounts with cash and/or promotional activity and emphasized that the total number of accounts does not represent the total number of players since certain gamblers play with multiple accounts.</p>
<p>The average monthly spend per active player was $191 (USD 140), according to official data.</p>
