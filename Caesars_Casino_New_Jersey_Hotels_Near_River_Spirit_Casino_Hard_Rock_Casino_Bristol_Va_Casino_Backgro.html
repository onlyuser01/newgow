    <h1>Caesars Casino New Jersey Hotels Near River Spirit Casino Hard Rock Casino Bristol Va Casino Backgro</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is an odd complaint due to the casinos poor behaviour. I'm not sure if it is due to their ignorance or there is something lost in translation/inadequate staff.</p>
<p>I used my revolut card to play at Party Casino. I was able to withdraw via bank transfer to my Irish bank however. I then didnt play for over a month and in that time closed my account with revolut due to my account being frauded (they have bad security). I therefore asked Party Casino to remove my revolut card from the account as I no longer had it or banked with revolut. They asked for something from the bank saying the account was closed and a bank statement from the bank I was withdrawing the money to (my irish one). I provided the email confirmation from revolut and my bank statement. This all seemed okay, but then Party asked for another POA. I sent my three phone bill. This was accepted. I then got an email saying they needed an official stamped cancellation statement from Revolut. I explained Revolut (as everyone knows) is an online banking and do not do this. I again sent them to email from Revolut stating the card was not active and the account was closed. They just seem to be acting like that email doesnt exist and are ignoring me when I explain this is all Revolut provide.</p>
<p>Party have now blocked me access to my account?</p>
<p>None of this makes sense nor is it inline with MGA guidelines or Consumer law. They allow bank transfer withdrawals (I was able to do one previously to my irish bank when the revolut card was active and they had no bank statement from me). Now, ive asked for the card to be removed and verified the bank I am withdrawing to, but this has caused them to block my account and attempt the theft of â‚¬2000?</p>
<p>I need you to help here as this is not correct.</p>
