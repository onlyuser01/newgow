    <h1>Ute Mountain Casino Hotel Resort Bella Vegas Casino Tropicana Online Casino All Slots Casino The M C</h1>

<p>The company has expanded with Super 7, a local operator that is based in Mendoza, one of the country’s provinces. Argentina has been regulating its iGaming industry province by province, with Mendoza being one of the places where online casino games are allowed.</p>
<p>Super 7 Welcomes Acclaimed Supplier Pragmatic</p>
<p>This means that Super 7 will be able to bring distinct brands to its audiences, including but not limited to innovative and fan-favorite titles such as Gates of Olympus, and the recently added Jewel Rush and Lamp of Infinity. The partnership is established in the hopes of strengthening both companies’ local footprint.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is bringing a selection of titles, including Boom City, PowerUP Roulette, Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, and more. In addition, Pragmatic Play will also be deploying its virtual sports product offer, giving Super 7 players a true and distinct experience that they can enjoy on their own time.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Pragmatic Play VP of LatAm Operations at ARRISE Victor Arias said that the region continues to be an important market for the supplier and its future ambitions. This is why the tie-up with Super 7 is particularly fortunate and in line with the company’s overall strategy for Latin America and Argentina in particular.</p>
<p>We can’t wait for more players to get their hands on Pragmatic Play’s innovative slots, live casino and virtual sports offerings – with plenty of success in LatAm thus far, we’re confident this partnership will be yet another fruitful one.

<p>Super 7 Mendoza’s Shai Rosenzvit was similarly excited about this partnership and spoke highly of the collaboration that was unfolding. He called Pragmatic Play one of the biggest and most worthwhile suppliers and their games – some of the most easily recognizable options to players.</p>
<p>Latin America High on Pragmatic’s Mind</p>
<p>Pragmatic has already had a significant impact on the Latin American market, Rosenzvit said, and confirmed that Super 7 is very excited to welcome the supplier as part of its own family and see what is next for the company. Recently, Pragmatic Play signed another partnership focusing on the Latin American market.</p>
<p>The company signed a partnership with Enjoywin.com designed to strengthen its positions across the entirety of South America, as the operator is well-represented in multiple markets in the region.</p>
