    <h1>Casino New York City Casino In Danville Va Casino Dallas Casino Grand Bay River Rock Casino Resort T</h1>

<p>Dear maryusolaru81,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. We accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds or winnings have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here, but correct me if I am wrong, please.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you still have access to your casino account, I would strongly recommend that you request permanent self-exclusion so you avoid making new deposits.</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
