<p>Due to his history of success, Peter-Paul de Goeij has been reappointed as NOGA's managing director to help maintain its leading position and bolster their expansion initiatives</p>
<p>Peter-Paul de Goeij will remain The Netherlands Online Gambling Association’s managing director for another two years. The organization’s board recognized his focus on modernization and overall contribution, lauding his efforts to elevate NOGA as a worthy representative of the country’s gaming industry. Former chairman Eric Konings also maintained a position in the Association and will contribute towards upcoming projects.</p>
<p>NOGA Represents the Largest Dutch Operators</p>
<p>The Netherlands Online Gambling Association represents the country’s most renowned online gambling providers, focusing on improving the Dutch gaming industry via constructive dialogue and cooperation. The organization currently includes 13 high-profile operators licensed in several European countries. LiveScore Bet is the latest addition to their ranks, joining in September after receiving its license from the Dutch regulator.</p>
<p>NOGA members share their knowledge and expertise with Dutch regulators to protect the integrity of the country’s gambling market and maintain responsible gaming standards. An example of the organization’s commitment is its 2021 petition to the national gambling regulator Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) to reduce gambling ads for land-based operators. At the beginning of December, NOGA also launched a charity campaign to help local sports teams struggling with rising energy costs.</p>
<p>De Boer Has a Proven Track Record</p>
<p>Much of the Association’s success is the direct result of its capable leadership team, and managing director Peter-Paul de Goeij has played a crucial role in the organization’s rise to prominence. Joining the trade body in 2019, he was instrumental in bringing NOGA to the limelight, attracting new members, and transforming it into a true industry representative. Former NOGA chairman Eric Konings also remained part of the Association, joining de Goeij in spearheading NOGA’s expansion efforts.</p>
<p>NOGA board of directors chairman Remko de Boer congratulated the two members on their reappointment. He added that both men had been invaluable in establishing fruitful relationships with stakeholders and industry peers, transforming the organization for the better. De Boer welcomed Konings and de Goeij’s future contributions, expressing hope that they would maintain the Association’s substantial momentum.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have been able to commit them to us for a longer period of time and to ensure future success.”</p>
<p>Remko de Boer, NOGA board of directors chairman</p>
<p>Konings and de Goeij expressed their gratitude to the board members for their reelection and reiterated their commitment to NOGA’s future objectives. De Goeij promised to continue his ongoing efforts in propelling NOGA to new heights, expanding its tasks, activities, and membership base.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with Eric and everyone at NOGA… to promote safer gambling and fulfill our responsibility as an industry. Konings and de Goeij</p>
<p>Peter-Paul de Goeij, NOGA managing director</p>
<p>De Goeij’s new tenure commences on 1 January, and his initial efforts will likely revolve around the industry’s ongoing acclimatization to the Dutch KOA act, which overhauled the country’s gambling regulations. Judging by his impressive track record, he should be more than a match for any future challenges in NOGA’s mission to shape a healthy and responsible gaming industry.</p>
