<p>Shane Stafford is the Interim Head of Channel Marketing at Three and a well-seasoned industry veteran who has helped many prominent brands build their identity, including heavyweights such as Paddy Power and BetVictor. Today, we speak with Stafford in the context of his participation in the upcoming Casino Guru Awards where he will weigh in as a judge in "The Most Ethical Approach to Marketing" category. He talks about the importance of instilling a culture of accountability among employees and focusing on conversing with customers to understand them better and thus make ethical marketing decisions.</p>
<p>Q: Shane, can you tell us a bit about yourself, and why did you agree to be a part of the jury for Casino Guru Awards’ The Most Ethical Approach to Marketing?</p>
<p>I’m a creative marketer with a strong commercial focus with nearly two decades of experience in highly regulated global markets delivering brand engagement across television, mobile, web and gaming platforms for top-tier companies like Symantec, Paddy Power, BetVictor and Three.</p>
<p>I help get brands noticed through better storytelling and creative content and strategy. I have a talent for connecting the dots, and helping tell amazing stories for brands within the Animation, Gaming, Sports, SaaS, Pharma and Telecommunications industries.</p>
<p>I think it's important to approach anything you do as a business with an ethical lens on, as a value management approach helps keep customers longer. Championing that with this award helps it resonate among a wider community of peers, and that matters.</p>
<p>Q: Speaking as an industry expert in this specific matter, what do you think is important in order for businesses in our industry to be ethical when communicating through marketing?</p>
<p>Treat your customers like you would like to be treated. It’s not rocket science, the truly powerful part of marketing ethically is having a two-way conversation, listening can be as effective as constantly talking to them. The more you engage the more you learn. Truly Understanding your customers gives you a distinct advantage because you will mean more to them.</p>
<p>Marketing ethics are crucial for a business because they protect the rights and lives of customers. Putting good ethical standards into action can help businesses achieve their short- and long-term marketing objectives.</p>
<p>Q: What are you going to be looking for in a company that wishes to win the distinction at the upcoming ceremony?</p>
<p>Earning the title of "Most Ethical Marketing" requires a comprehensive strategy that integrates first and foremost, creativity. It needs to be applied in a simple and clear way, encompassing moral principles, openness, social responsibility, and a customer value management approach. They need to be able to distinguish themselves as a pioneer in ethical marketing and foster trust among customers and competitors by demonstrating these traits.</p>
<p>Q: What advice do you have to offer to companies that want to do better when it comes to marketing but struggle with following clear guidelines?</p>
<p>I think it’s important to create a culture where employees take responsibility for their marketing efforts and are held accountable for adhering to the rules. Individuals and teams should be praised and rewarded for championing the rules consistently and producing outstanding marketing results.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to seek external advice. Consider seeking advice from outside marketing professionals that may offer an unbiased viewpoint and assist in pinpointing areas for development if internal difficulties continue. They can bring a different perspective of thinking to the table, unique strategy suggestions, and direction on how to match marketing initiatives with your overarching business goals.</p>
<p>Q: Do you reckon that marketing has improved for the better over the last years, and do you think this is a conscious choice or regulatory pressure?</p>
<p>I would like to answer that as an optimistic yes. I think it is getting better and the implementation of regulations helps, but correlation does not imply causation. Our behavior has changed dramatically in tandem. I think the way we see our customers has changed also. Understanding our customers has helped with a truly ethical approach, as it’s a relationship of trust. Lots of great things are happening, and lots more needs to be done. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
