<p>Local officials closed the access road to the casino on Sunday because of flood waters from the nearby Mississippi River. There was no flooding in the casino’s parking lot, or water reaching the hotel or casino buildings, according to local news reports.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Fitz casino reported on its Facebook page, “No flood waters inside or even on the property parking lot! Just a bunch of lonely slots &amp; table games waiting for your return!”</p>
<p>Despite the threat, six other nearby casinos in the northern Mississippi community remained open. The Tunica region has nine casinos — though none are actually located within Tunica proper.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River crested on Tuesday at 52.5 feet in Tunica, representing its second-highest level on record. The highest cresting was in 2011, when most of the casinos were closed for weeks.</p>
<p>Frustrated Gamblers</p>
<p>Some would-be patrons were frustrated they could not get to the casino. Kirk Greers Fairy from southwest Arkansas told WREG TV, “I’m disappointed. Disappointed in not being able to play.” He was on his honeymoon.</p>
<p>At nearby Gold Strike Casino Resort, sandbags were placed near the entrance to the employee parking lot and near the hotel as precautions, the TV station reported. As an added precaution, the US Army Corps of Engineers built up mini levees in the area.</p>
<p>Upon its reopening, Fitz Casino announced several promotional specials.</p>
<p>Mississippi is far from the only state where flooding forced closings of casinos. In February, the casino at Belterra Casino Resort, located in Florence, Indiana, and Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino, located in Elizabeth, were forced to temporarily close due to Ohio River floodwaters. Harrah’s Casino in Metropolis, Illinois, was also closed due to flooding along the Ohio River.</p>
<p>A year earlier, the Horseshoe Southern Indiana riverboat casino, known locally as “The Boat,” was temporarily closed, too, due to water levels on the Ohio River.</p>
<p>New Gulf Coast Casino Proposed</p>
<p>Despite recent flooding and threats from possible hurricanes, Mississippi’s Gulf Coast could soon see more casino space.</p>
<p>Cure Land Co. wants to build a casino in Clermont Harbor, which is east of the Silver Slipper Casino in Lakeshore. The company recently revealed that it had filed paperwork with the Mississippi Gaming Commission seeking approval from the state to build a casino with 1,100 slot machines and 22 table games, plus a 300-room hotel.</p>
<p>Mississippi gaming regulations now require new casinos be accompanied by a hotel facility with a minimum of 300 rooms.</p>
<p>Clermont Harbor is adjacent to Lakeshore, which is home to the Silver Slipper riverboat. That property’s general manager — John Ferrucci — told the Sun Herald that if the nearby casino is approved, he believes it will help draw more business to the isolated area and make it more of a destination.</p>
