    <h1>Parx Casino Hotel Chumash Casino Jobs Bet777 Eu Casino Punta Cana Casinos Plus Casino Cashwin Casino</h1>

<p>What is stated is false! Not all four withdrawals were credited back to my gaming account and the gaming account balance was NZD 3,800.00 of which 2,700.00 was replayed (I have proof of what I am saying as I took several screenshots when I was playing with the relevant balances ). The first withdrawal, as confirmed via email, was duly approved and completed via cryptocurrency and never reached the writer. Only later was it declared bankrupt in the chat by Cameron stating that I had been notified of the non-payment, which never happened! At first, Cameron himself had confirmed to me in chat that the first withdrawal had been paid despite the fact that it was in the rejected state on the cashier's screen. He also warned me of a system (technical) error that didn't show me the actual status of the transaction which instead appeared to have been completed and sent, to confirm this I was sent the notification of the completion of this first transaction via cryptocurrency. Not yet seeing the money in my BTC wallet, I contacted Cameron himself again in chat where this time he informed me that the transaction which initially appeared to have been paid was now instead failed and that the money had been credited back into the gaming account and an email was was sent, money never seen and email never received. I would add that it is paradoxical that a cryptocurrency transaction confirmed by the blockchain and the casino subsequently fails for no real reason. However, the money was clearly never transferred to my gaming account. Gaming account which had a balance of almost NZD 3,800.00 as per the screenshot in my possession. It is clear how the casino tried to hinder my withdrawals with the intention of making me replay them all with the excuse of the technical error, an error which upon my first complaint had coincidentally been immediately corrected at the cash desk, correcting the status of the first withdrawal from refused and completed with immediate notification of payment, then the event happened or without notifying me anything I was told verbally (chat) that the payment had instead failed! And where did NZD 1,091.00 go? I would also add that I could also request compensation for damages for the continuous disservices suffered.</p>
<p>This behavior on your part is truly dishonest. I therefore request the sending via email of all the accounting transactions (casino and sports) carried out since I registered with you and the immediate payment of the first transaction which appears to have been paid in all respects as per the notification sent via email and never reached the writer. Failing this, I will be forced to take legal action in the appropriate offices with a further increase in the costs incurred and the damage suffered.</p>
