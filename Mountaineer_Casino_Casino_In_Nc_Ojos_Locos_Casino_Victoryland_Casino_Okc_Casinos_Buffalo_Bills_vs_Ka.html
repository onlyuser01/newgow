    <h1>Mountaineer Casino Casino In Nc Ojos Locos Casino Victoryland Casino Okc Casinos Buffalo Bills vs Ka</h1>

<p>The Buffalo Bills travel to Arrowhead Stadium this Sunday to take on the Kansas City Chiefs in what could be an early preview of the AFC Championship Game. Both teams have been sensational since the start of the 2022 season, each winning four and losing one game so far.</p>
<p>Both teams have been fantastic in the offense – The Chiefs have the #1 most productive offense in the NFL with 159 points scored (31.8 PPG), while the Bills are second in the league with 152 points (30.4 PPG).</p>
<p>Buffalo’s defense has also been playing elite football, conceding fewer points than any other team in the conference – 61 points in total (12.2 PPG). The Chiefs have conceded more than two times as many points, which is one of the reasons why bookies see them as underdogs in Week 6.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bills’ Defense in the Spotlight</p>
<p>Quarterback Josh Allen has been sensational in the 2022 season, throwing for 14 touchdowns and only four interceptions. Six different players have caught his TD passes, with wide receiver Stefon Diggs leading the way with five TDs.</p>
<p>The Bills’ rushing game has also been impressive, with running backs Devin Singletary, Zack Moss, and James Cook putting on some impressive performances so far in the five-game weeks of the 2022 season.</p>
<p>As a result, Buffalo has the no. 2-scoring offense in the league with 159 points. Its defense has also been impressive, currently sharing the top spot with the San Francisco 49ers – each team has conceded just 61 points. It sure is a great achievement, but the question is whether the Bills’ defense can handle the Chiefs’ powerful offense.</p>
<p>What’s feeding them with confidence ahead of Week 6 is that they’ve already managed to put on some superb performances against teams famous for mighty offenses. So far, we saw them holding the reigning Super Bowl champs, the Los Angeles Rams, to just 10 points, as well as the Tennessee Titans to 7 points.</p>
<p>Patrick Mahomes Has Been Brilliant at Home</p>
<p>The Chiefs offense has been brilliant this season, with a total of 159 points scored, which is more than any other team in the NFL. They have a 3-0 record at home this season and are without a single regular-season loss since October 2021.</p>
<p>Their quarterback Patrick Mahomes has particularly been great at home. When playing at Arrowhead, he’s thrown for 15 touchdowns and only two touchdowns. In Kansas City’s most recent game, the QB threw for four TDs and no interceptions in last week’s MNF game.</p>
<p>All four of those TDs were caught by tight end Travis Kelce, who’s been having the best season of his career. He now has seven TDs to his name in the 2022 season, which makes him this team’s most productive scorer. Just behind him is running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire who’s scored three receiving TDs and two rushing TDs.</p>
<p>The Chiefs wide receivers, however, haven’t been in the spotlight in 2022, which isn’t surprising considering that Tyreek Hill is no longer on the team.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>We think the Buffalo Bills are the superior team, but this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to win on Sunday. The thing is that the Bills at Chiefs game is played at Arrowhead Stadium, which is one of the largest venues in the NFL. With the help of more than 70,000 fans, the Chiefs should be able to grab themselves a win.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win; over to hit</p>
