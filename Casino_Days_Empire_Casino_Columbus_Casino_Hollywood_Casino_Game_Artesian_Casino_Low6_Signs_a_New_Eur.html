    <h1>Casino Days Empire Casino Columbus Casino Hollywood Casino Game Artesian Casino Low6 Signs a New Eur</h1>

<p>Low6 and the European Tour have released a new app called European Picks. In it, players have a chance to win up to £4,000 ($5,400) in total, or £1,000 ($1,300) each day of the now-ongoing ACCIONA Open de España as part of a free-to-play contest.</p>
<p>Users are tasked with answering a series of questions, including predictions about the final winner of the tournament, which player will make the most birdies, and the longest drive for every day of tournament play. Each answer gives a particular score that positions users on a leaderboard against the rest of the participants.</p>
<p>Second Swing in Two Days for Low6</p>
<p>This is the second golfing app for Low6 after announcing just days ago that it would be the official F2P supplier of PointsBet. That arrangement will cover the PGA Tour with its free-to-play contest. The app, however, will be only available in the USA.</p>
<p>Guy Kinnings, deputy CEO and chief commercial officer for the European Tour, commented on the release, pointing to the fact that the game of golf offers many opportunities for fans to compete and stay engaged with golf events. He added, “We are always looking at ways to enhance the fan experience, and golf, with the amount of data available on every shot on every hole, offers a wealth of opportunity for gaming.”</p>
<p>The Discovery of a New Market for Gaming: Non-Gamers</p>
<p>Free-to-play games are increasing their popularity quickly, and Low6 seems to be keen on developing this market further. They recently completed a partnership with the Jacksonville Jaguars, which also adds to their portfolio of social betting products. Free-to-play games are considered to be less intimidating to people who are not accustomed to betting real money.</p>
<p>They prove to be successful in driving up engagement levels from viewers. The games are seen as a possibility of developing new audiences and markets and ultimately bringing in more revenue from sports. Moreover, they are also an effective tool capable of attracting some of the youngest audiences – such as generation Me/Z, which are well-versed in all types of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Low6’s app is available both on IOS and Android, with more info on europeantourpicks.com and the ACCIONA Open de España well underway.</p>
