<p>Another international media and entertainment conglomerate is joining the blockchain space and pushing for blockchain gaming with Turner Sports, a company owned by Warner Media, joining the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Turner Sports which operates sports broadcasts on TBS, TNT, TruTV and others, has announced the introduction of “Blocklete Games,” a proprietor blockchain platform that allows players to collect and level up, and trade digital athletes for a chance to earn prizes. The play-to-earn model is not new in blockchain gaming.</p>
<p>To carry out the offer, Turner Sports will use non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a solution where each individual token is verifiably unique thanks to the Ethereum ecosystem. Players will be allowed to own digital athletes, or “Blockletes,” and these players can be transferred between players using Turner Sports’ dedicated blockchain platform crafted for the purposes.</p>
<p>To kickstart the entire blockchain gaming bonanza, Turner Sports has released its first game, Blocklete Golf, which will allow players to own NFT Blocklete golfers. Commenting on these developments, VP of Business Operations &amp; Strategy at Turner Sports, Yang Adija, expressed hopes that blockchain fans would allow fans to garner a better control over the gaming experience.</p>
<p>“Our service leverages the blockchain such that anyone can play personalized sports games with their friends, with the potential to also generate a return on their investment in the game.”</p>
<p>To facilitate payments to and from the platform, Turner Sports has teamed up with BitPay. As a result players may pay with Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH, as well as Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>Blockchain Gaming Continues to Develop in Leaps and Bounds</p>
<p>More payment solutions are underway, including stablecoins such as Tether (USDT). Blockchain gaming has been growing in intensity and popularity. CryptoKitties, a game allowing you to trade blockchain kittens and other pets, has been able to distribute 75% of its revenue back to gamers, cementing the play-to-earn model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been efforts to localize the online casino experience for blockchain. FunFair Technologies, a company that has developed a proprietor casino gaming platform for the company’s own FUN token, has been able to expand in new markets, including Japan.</p>
<p>Ethereum Gaming has got a major power spike after Chainlink, a dedicated developer in the blockchain gaming space created a verifiable randomness solution (VRF) earlier this year.</p>
