<p>Cambage set the WNBA single-game scoring record five years ago as the starting center for the Dallas Wings. She exploded for 53 points against the New York Liberty on July 17, 2018.</p>
<p>Cambage broke the previous scoring record held by Riquna Williams, who scored 51 points for the Tulsa Shock against the San Antonio Stars in 2013.</p>
<p>The Aces selected Wilson with the #1 pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft out of South Carolina. She won the WNBA Rookie of the Year in 2018.</p>
<p>Last year was a magical season for Wilson. She led the Aces to their first WNBA title and won the WNBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.</p>
<p>Wilson is a two-time WNBA MVP and the current betting favorite to win a third MVP award since 2020.</p>
<p>As the Aces’ leading scorer, Wilson averages 22.3 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 2.1 blocked shots this season.</p>
<p>Wilson on Fire, 53 Points in 33 Minutes</p>
<p>Wilson scored a career-high 40 points against the Washington Mystics less than two weeks ago. She erupted for 53 points against the Atlanta Dream Tuesday night in a 112-100 victory.</p>
<p>“A’ja runs like a deer, jumps like a cat, and catches as if she were Spider-Man,” said Aces head coach Becky Hammon. “She is just special. Her real gift is in her humility and grace, and how she handles herself and her teammates. She is a phenomenal superstar.”</p>
<p>Wilson scored 53 points and added seven rebounds and four blocked shots in only 33 minutes of action. She shot 20-for-21 from the free-throw line, which set a career-best for Wilson. She also connected on 16-for-23 from the floor. Although Wilson isn’t considered a 3-point threat, she knocked down her only attempt.</p>
<p>I was just really aggressive today,” said Wilson. “I’m out there having fun. And I get the opportunity to play with some amazing women. I don’t take these moments for granted. It was kind of just in the flow. The biggest thing is just my timing. I see a lot of different defenses every possession.”</p>
<p>“We’re watching just a generational talent,” said teammate Kelsey Plum. “What we’re seeing right now is historic, and it’s just beginning. A’ja is one of the greatest players of all-time.”</p>
<p>With a road victory against the Dream, the Aces bounced back from a 6-point loss against the Los Angeles Sparks on Saturday. The Aces were 16-0 on their home court prior to Saturday’s loss at Michelob ULTRA Arena in the Mandalay Bay Casino.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Aces Futures</p>
<p>Wilson is the betting favorite to win the WNBA MVP at -120 odds, putting her just ahead of Breanna Stewart at +105 odds. Stewart, an All-Star forward with the New York Liberty, averages 22.6 points, 9.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. Stewart boasts the second-best average in the WNBA, behind Jewell Loyd of the Seattle Storm with 24.1 points per game.</p>
<p>The Aces (29-4) and the Liberty (25-7) have already qualified for the postseason. The two best teams in the league are expected to meet in the WNBA Finals. If the season ended today, the Aces would secure the #1 seed and the Liberty would lock up #2.</p>
<p>The Aces still don’t know the status of Candace Parker. The veteran forward/center underwent surgery in July to repair a fractured foot.</p>
<p>The Aces are -215 odds to successfully defend their title and win back-to-back WNBA championships. The Liberty are +200 odds to win their franchise’s first WNBA title. The Dallas Wings and Connecticut Sun are both +2500 odds to win the WNBA title, and they’re the closest competition to the Aces and Liberty on the futures board.</p>
<p>The Aces are owned by Mark Davis, who also owns the Las Vegas Raiders. Davis sold future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady a piece of the Aces in early 2023 prior to selling him a minority stake of the Raiders after he retired from the NFL.</p>
<p>Here’s a fun fact: Wilson’s first name, A’ja, was inspired by the Steely Dan studio album “Aja”, which was released in 1977 by ABC Records.</p>
