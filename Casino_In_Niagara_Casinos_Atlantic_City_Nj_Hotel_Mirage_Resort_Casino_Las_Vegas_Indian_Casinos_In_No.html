<p>This will boost the existing partnership between the two companies while bringing more exciting games to players in Romania</p>
<p>Just after launching a dazzling new live casino game called Vegas Ball Bonanza, Pragmatic Play, a leading supplier of content to the online gambling industry, announced a new partnership with a European operator.</p>
<p>As announced, Pragmatic Play will supply live casino content to Superbet, a Romanian gambling operator. This will boost the existing partnership between the two companies while bringing more exciting games to players in the Eastern European country.</p>
<p>Under the enhanced deal, Superbet will receive access to Pragmatic Play’s “hugely popular” gameshow products such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Snakes &amp; Ladders Live. In addition, Superbet will get to provide players with a dedicated Roulette with Customizable Branding and three dedicated live dealer Blackjack tables.</p>
<p>The new products will join Superbet’s rich portfolio, which already includes slots and bingo products from Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>What sets the supplier’s live casino content apart from some of its competitors is its high customizability and dedicated branded environments for its partners. In addition, Pragmatic Play’s live casino products leverage cutting-edge tech to give the supplier’s operator partners full control over the games’ look and feel.</p>
<p>For example, Pragmatic Play recently penned a similar deal with Betsson.</p>
<p>Superbet Is Delighted to Add More Content from the Provider</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, commented on the extended deal with Superbet. She said that the provider has already seen “incredible success” with Superbet. Cornides added that her team is delighted to add more of its games to Superbet’s platform.</p>
<p>Players in Romania continue to embrace Pragmatic Play games, and we are thrilled to be launching custom-branded Roulette and Blackjack tables tailor-made especially for Superbet and its players to enjoy. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Superbet’s head of gaming and live casino, Nicholas Yu, lauded Pragmatic Play as “one of the most well-known providers in the iGaming market. Because of that, his team is excited to onboard more of Pragmatic Play’s “incredible games.”</p>
<p>Our players always come back to Pragmatic Play releases due to their replayability and engaging gameplay, so we hope to see similar results as a result of this expanded partnership. Nicholas Yu, head of gaming and live casino, Superbet</p>
