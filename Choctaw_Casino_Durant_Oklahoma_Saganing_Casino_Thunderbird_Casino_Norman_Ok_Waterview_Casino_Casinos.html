<p>Hello tomas. I have used the withdrawl method via check with them before. I dont believe i used a bonus while playing this past session. I reached out again to them last night. They caimed they are short on checks to issue and request me to cxl current withdrawl and opt for wire transfer. I informed them i originally did opt for wire withdrawl months ago. They denied with no explanation, so i switched to check withdrawl. Here i am over a month after this, and they want me to cxl and rewithdraw via wire transfer again! I have not done this yet for two main reasons, and ur input would be appreciated. First is that this restarts the entire bogus waiting they make u do. Website claims within 10 business days but this is absolutely not true. Second is that i had same exact issue with they sister casino coolcat recently. They give many excuses to lag the process. I had 3 withdrawls for coolcat casino-they told me they were out of checks, that i had to rquest wire transfer and wait all over again. Well, i did this and month later it showed my withdrawl approved. So as im checking my bank acct to see if funds delivered, i get a check in mail for the first of three withdrawly! Seriously? This check was delivered just yesterday. They use the same ridiculous excuses. They make no sense. Just pay me my money already. Id be willing to bet i get no wire transfers at all- checks only. The checks are literally just printed from they computer. Nothing special that they can be short of or run out of. Its frustrating talking to the customer support. No help or valid reasons for doing what they do.</p>
