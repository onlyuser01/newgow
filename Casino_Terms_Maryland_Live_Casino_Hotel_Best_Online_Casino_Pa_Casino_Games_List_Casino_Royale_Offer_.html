    <h1>Casino Terms Maryland Live Casino Hotel Best Online Casino Pa Casino Games List Casino Royale Offer</h1>

<p>Dear pf7zy9rfty,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your issue. I have checked the 21.Red Casino's Terms and Conditions and this is what I found:</p>
<p>8.4 If you have elected to self-exclude from or to close (for any reason, including among others for gambling addiction) your Account that you hold with the Website, you acknowledge and agree that you are not automatically self-excluded from any other site/brand that operates under the relevant license as stated under clause 1.1 , whether you already hold an Account with any other brand under the relevant license as stated under clause 1.1 ("Additional Account(s)") or not, during the period you have selected.</p>
<p>8.5 In the event that you have managed to open or use an Additional Account while you have elected to self-exclude or close your Account, we and/or any brands that operate under the relevant license as stated under clause 1.1, shall additionally be entitled (but not obliged) to suspend any funds you may deposit (or have previously deposited), void any bets and forfeit the winnings in any Additional Account). Moreover, should you succeed to open an Additional Account, we and/or any brands that operate under the relevant license as stated under clause 1.1 will not be liable for any direct or indirect consequential damages that you may suffer.</p>
<p>8.6 For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that you have managed to open or use an Additional Account while you have elected to self-exclude or close your Account, neither we nor any brands that operate under the relevant license as stated under clause 1.1, shall be liable to refund to you any funds you may wager in any Additional Account during the period you have selected.</p>
<p>Kindly bear in mind that it is important to submit a self-exclusion request in each casino you wish to be self-excluded from. We recommend you always check if the self-exclusion is valid for one site or for the whole group of casinos operating under the same license.</p>
<p>Could you please specify if you asked to be self-excluded in 21.Red Casino due to gambling problems? If not, I am afraid that we will not be able to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your understanding and for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
