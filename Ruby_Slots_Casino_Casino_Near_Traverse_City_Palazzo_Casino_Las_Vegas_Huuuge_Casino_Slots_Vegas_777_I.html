<p>Conducted between May 26 and June 5, 2023, the survey provides a comprehensive insight into the habits, preferences, and potential risks associated with sports betting among various demographic groups</p>
<p>A recent Men’s Health survey on sports betting habits among US male residents has unveiled a significant trend – millennial black men are outpacing their white counterparts in the frequency of sports betting.</p>
<p>Survey Unveils Complex Dynamics of Ethnicity, Age, and Technology in Sports Gambling</p>
<p>Among the 3,800 American men surveyed, the findings challenge conventional assumptions, shedding light on a complex relationship between ethnicity, age, and technology in the realm of sports gambling.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 1,500 admitted to placing at least one sports bet in the past year, a figure that provides a unique perspective on the landscape of sports gambling.</p>
<p>Millennials, known for their comfort with technology, have emerged as the most active participants in sports betting. The convenience of mobile applications and online platforms has driven their engagement, resulting in an increased frequency of betting. Strikingly, millennial Black men have emerged as the frontrunners in this trend, betting more frequently compared to their white counterparts.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the LGBTQ+ community is not represented in this survey, however, another recent study showed that such communities are at higher risk of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Technology has undoubtedly played a role in shaping the habits of the modern bettor. A majority of those surveyed, a striking 76%, revealed that they place their bets through mobile applications or computers, and the evolution of app-based wagering has led to an increase in betting frequency for two-thirds of the respondents.</p>
<p>Favored Sports and Sportsbook Operators Unveiled in Survey Results</p>
<p>The survey also sheds light on the favored sports among bettors, with football, basketball, and baseball taking the top spots. An interesting trend emerged in the preference for sportsbook operators, with 61% of respondents favoring DraftKings and 56% choosing FanDuel. Another noteworthy finding is the preference for professional sports over college athletics, with 56% of respondents indicating a preference for the former.</p>
<p>While the sports betting landscape has experienced considerable growth since the overturning of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 2018, the survey has highlighted that concerns remain. A notable portion of 34% of respondents expressed annoyance at commercials run by sportsbook companies during games, and 38% felt that broadcasters should abstain from making betting references while on air.</p>
<p>The survey reveals a concerning aspect, as 44% struggle to enjoy sports without feeling compelled to bet, while 58% report detrimental effects on their mental health, including stress, anxiety, and depression. Nearly 4 out of 5 individuals admit to experiencing anxiety while betting, reflecting the emotional intensity tied to such activities. Additionally, 43% indicate that sports betting has taken a toll on their physical well-being, contributing to issues like headaches, high blood pressure, and weight gain.</p>
