<p>Global sports data and technology company Sportradar Group announced today it received one of the highest industry accreditations related to quality assurance processes, the International Betting Integrity Association’s (IBIA) Data Standards Kitemark.</p>
<p>Industry Recognition</p>
<p>Sportradar was granted IBIA’s Data Standards Kitemark for matching the set of standards and guidelines related to how sports data should be collected to ensure protection for the integrity of the sport against betting corruption.</p>
<p>The accreditation that was developed by IBIA in 2020 and is subject to an annual audit was awarded to the sports data and technology group following an audit by the globally recognized specialist in testing, inspection and certification for online gambling software and systems eCommerce and Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance (eCOGRA).</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, IBIA CEO Khalid Ali said that the integrity organization developed the set of standards to ensure “the highest levels of transparency and accuracy” for the collection and supply chain of sports data. He added, “Companies like Sportradar that pass the audit have demonstrated robust internal procedures for the collation of sporting event data for betting. Accurate data collation reassures sports fans and bettors alike that the events they watch are fair, honest and performed at the highest competitive levels.”</p>
<p>Considering the Data Standards as a living document, the global integrity organization intends to assess and update its requirements on a regular basis to make sure that whichever operator is granted the accreditation implements the highest levels of data collation and quality assurance processes.</p>
<p>‘Dedication to Data Quality, Integrity and Transparency’</p>
<p>Sportradar chief regulatory and compliance officer Dr. Anja Martin outlined the company’s commitment to “delivering the most reliable and highest-quality data products” to its customers and business partners. “We invest heavily in our quality control systems and processes, implementing the industry’s most stringent safeguards to ensure that the products presented to the downstream market are trustworthy,” she explained. “Receiving accreditation from the IBIA for its Data Standards Kitemark further substantiates Sportradar’s rigorous dedication to data quality, integrity and transparency.”</p>
<p>With five strategically located around the world collection centers and over 700 data experts certified for quality management, Sportradar is providing 24/7 data collection services, enhanced by in-stadium verification of data and augmented by sports leagues’ direct feeds, computer vision and artificial intelligence technology.</p>
<p>With a capacity of up to 30 million odds changes per minute and a 99.9% level of accuracy, Sportradar affirmed itself as the trusted data partner for major sports leagues, organizations and federations around the globe.</p>
<p>This year, the Swiss-based data and technology group established long-term partnerships in the betting data collection and integrity services space with leagues and organizations like the National Hockey League (NHL), International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) and the European Handball Federation (EHF).</p>
