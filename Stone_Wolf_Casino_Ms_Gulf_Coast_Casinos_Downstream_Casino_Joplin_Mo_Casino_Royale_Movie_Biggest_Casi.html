<p>Players who are already acquainted with the first game will be happy to discover the fun has been doubled in the new release with the addition of an extra set of reels and the unique 10 Series Win Ways mechanic developed by Greentube. This game mechanic lets players enjoy more ways to win by having some of the symbols removed to enable more of them to fall into place.</p>
<p>The game also features Transferring Wild symbols. Each of the wilds landing to the left reels are carried across the corresponding reel to the right. Players can also redeem Free Spins whenever they land a minimum of three Scatters showing up on reels one, three or five on either set of reels. To get eight Free Spins, players must come across three Scatter symbols. Finding four Scatters will trigger 12 Free Spins, while the maximum of 20 Free Spins can be obtained with at least five Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>While using the Free Spins, any Wild symbols landing on the reels to the left will get sent over to the right. During the same Free Spins round, players can also find Special Expanding Symbols that can be randomly selected prior to the beginning of the feature. These stacked symbols also have the ability to transfer across the reels for even more chances of winning.</p>
<p>The game also features a Buy Bonus feature that carries players straight into the Free Spins round in some jurisdictions. Greentube’s director of games development and operations Steve Cross spoke about the way the original hame “still proves to be a huge hit with players”, adding how “great” it was to be able to “refresh and breathe new life” into the beloved game.</p>
<p>August has been a busy month for Greentube, with an announced partnership with Circus that will enhance its presence on the Belgian and Dutch markets and clearance from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario for launch in the Canadian province.</p>
