    <h1>Casino In Atlantic City Mgm Grand Casino Detroit Stardust Casino Casino Movie Streaming Casino Charl</h1>

<p>I deposit 50€ to play with the first bonus deposit. When I finished the wagering, my balance was 955€. I played only(!) one spin by accident with 2,40€, when my balance was around 850€ and the wagering was near 60-70%. I repeat ONE spin by accident because I played from my phone. (The maximum allowed bet is 2€) When I made a withdrawal after I asked the support to tell me if everything is ok, the next day the withdrawal cancelled and my balance was at first 0€ and then 50€ from 955€.</p>
<p>They told me that I exceeded the maximum allowed bet for the bonus wagering and my last deposit was returned to my gaming balance.</p>
<p>I feel that they stole me. This is so unfair.</p>
<p>I need your help because I made everything right and I can't believe that this one spin really affected something.</p>
<p>When I finished the wagering I asked an agent in chat (Eliana her name) if everything is ok. She told me that checked the wagering, everything is fine and I can make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>I asked her to send me the whole conversation to my email but she said that I can find all the conversations in their site. I tried to find this conversation, but the conversation was deleted.</p>
