    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale Center Strip River Spirit Casino Resort Maine Casinos Mr Lucky Casin</h1>

<p>Hello, I have registered with the above casino, apparently illegally, since I am from Germany.</p>
<p>This is not visible to the player! No place of residence is asked during the registration process, rather there is only the possibility of selecting a telephone country code, in my case +49, which was automatically suggested in the registration form. After registering, I read the conditions, Germany is NOT listed as an excluded country. So I deposited and played. After I had a win, I tried to reach the customer service, the advertised e-mail addresses unfortunately all lead to Intobet instead of Genzobet. The email address listed for the KYC check also does not work. I gambled away my winnings in the meantime. Before I continue to deposit, I tried all the email addresses listed again to check that my registration is really correct. This time my email arrived and I was told that Germany was excluded. I am requesting a refund of my deposits and requesting that my account be closed. My account has been closed, they don't want to refund my deposits. I consider this to be extremely unfair as no possible win would have been paid out at any point, so I had no chance of winning at all. In addition, the casino suggests that registration from Germany is allowed, although this is not the case. I want other games to experience this too!</p>
