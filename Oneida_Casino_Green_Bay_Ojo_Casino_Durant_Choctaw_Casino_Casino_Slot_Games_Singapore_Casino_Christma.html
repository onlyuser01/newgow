<p>Christmas Big Bass Bonanza review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Prepare for a festive fishing trip with Christmas Big Bass Bonanza’s holiday theme.</p>
<p>Players will arrive at a frozen lake and open their tackle box to find candy canes and Christmas baubles among their equipment. The fresh outdoorsy atmosphere will get everyone in the holiday spirit as they cast their lines. With any luck, they’ll reel in some bass in Santa hats.</p>
<p>This slot is a great pick for players who love the original Big Bass Bonanza, but want a little Christmas fun too.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cheerful soundtrack is infused with sleigh bells and sets an optimistic mood. The reels spin with a bubbling sound, reminding players that they are out on a lake.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see candy striped fishing lines, tackle boxes filled with treats, and a sleigh decorated with an anchor. The quality of the animation is moderate and colourful.</p>
<p>The most adorable symbol is the bass fish wearing a red Santa hat as he leaps right out of his reel. A hook is tantalizingly close to the fish’s mouth, suggesting a big catch is close at hand.</p>
<p>Behind the reels is the icy blue water of the lake, with the surface at the top of the screen. This makes the players feel as if they are right in the chilly water. Snow drifts slowly down in the distance, reinforcing the wintery theme.</p>
<p>Big win in the Free Spins bonus game</p>
<p>On occasion, a silhouetted Santa’s sleigh flies by, adding a little more magical Christmas spirit.</p>
<p>Fans of the original Big Bass Bonanza slot will recognize the graphics and enjoy the whimsical Christmas additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Christmas Big Bass Bonanza is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The slot has a fun bonus feature (see below for detail) keeping up the fast gameplay of the base game.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. It appears on every reel during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Fish symbols are also Money symbols, and players can win their value during the Free Spins feature. Otherwise they work as standard Fish symbols from the base game.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature will begin. The number of free spins awarded goes up depending on how many Scatters triggered the feature:</p>
<p>3 Scatters – 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters – 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters – 20 free spins</p>
<p>Wild symbols gather all the values of Money symbols on the reels during the Free Spins feature. Every Wild symbol that lands during the feature is collected until the conclusion.</p>
<p>Every time players collect a 4th Wild symbol, the Free Spins feature is re-triggered with 10 free spins. The multiplier for collected Money symbols increases to x2 the first time the feature is retriggered, to x3 the second time, and to x10 for the third time the feature is retriggered.</p>
<p>If there is just one Wild symbol on the screen, the random feature can add some Money symbols</p>
<p>Players accumulate their retriggered spins to play after completing the current round. The feature cannot be retriggered for a fourth time.</p>
<p>The maximum win is x2,100 the player’s total bet, and if this is reached the round will end.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
