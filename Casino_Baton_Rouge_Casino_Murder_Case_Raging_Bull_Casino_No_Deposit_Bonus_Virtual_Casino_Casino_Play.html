    <h1>Casino Baton Rouge Casino Murder Case Raging Bull Casino No Deposit Bonus Virtual Casino Casino Play</h1>

<p>Casino Portugal is ESA Gaming’s First Foray into the Portuguese Industry</p>
<p>After signing a deal with leading local operator Casino Portugal to include its EasySwipeT titles, innovative games provider ESA Gaming has made its first foray into the Portuguese market.</p>
<p>ESA Partners with Casino Portugal</p>
<p>Customers at Casino Portugal will soon be able to play ESA’s EasySwipe games, which include the best-selling Fruit Staxx. Players will gain access to ESA’s upcoming games later in the year, with multiple releases planned.</p>
<p>ESA’s EasySwipe portfolio, designed to seamlessly integrate into sportsbooks to give players the highest quality casino games without upsetting the sports betting portfolio, adds something completely special to a competitive market.</p>
<p>The titles offer sports bettors a different experience and bring them to a new vertical of casino games with established cross-selling potential, thanks to their fast-resolving, quick-gratification games.</p>
<p>Casino Portugal is a leading provider of sports betting and online casino games through a groundbreaking national platform.</p>
<p>With a land-based heritage, the company introduced its online brand in 2016, when the Portuguese market opened.</p>
<p>Following a certification process, this is ESA’s first foray into the Portuguese market, paving the way for future transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, online gaming revenue in Portugal rose by 58%, with online slots accounting for 71% of all gameplay.</p>
<p>In the country, fifteen operators are licensed to provide both online gaming and sports betting. Director at ESA Gaming, Zorica Smallwood, said: “Entering new markets is a key focus for us this year as we look to further expand the reach of our products.”</p>
<p>Smallwood also said that ESA is thrilled to launch their EasySwipe portfolio to their customers for the first time.</p>
<p>Portugal is a market with a lot of promise, and ESA Gaming is excited to enter the country with Casino Portugal, a well-known and respected local operator.</p>
<p>Co-CEO at Casino Portugal, António Laranjo stated that Casino Portugal will be able to add a new layer of content to its current offering thanks to this alliance with ESA Gaming.</p>
<p>Casino Portugal is excited to be the first operator in the country to bring EasySwipe games to their expanding customer base.</p>
<p>The Rapid Expansion of ESA Gaming Continues</p>
<p>Another marked had the privilege to gain access to EasySwipe games after ESA Gaming entered the Italian market with a new partnership with Scommettendo in January 2020.</p>
<p>ESA provided the operator with its EasySwipe portfolio of optimized HTML5 mobile-first games that are easily incorporated into sportsbook offerings and designed to promote gamification for all parties.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming had previously pursued closer relations with other well-known Italian operators, including Aresway in late December. ESA used Aresway’s gaming aggregating system to make its EasySwipe portfolio available to the Italian iGaming group.</p>
