<p>Paragon Gaming Sells Stake in Vancouver’s Parq Casino in Wake of Controversy and Financial Loss</p>

<p>Las Vegas-based Paragon Gaming has sold its stake in the Parq Casino, a luxury gaming facility in downtown Vancouver which has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons since its 2017 opening.</p>

<p>Paragaon announced that it has unloaded its ownership shares to the PBC Group, an Ottawa-based real estate developer, for an undisclosed amount. PBC, along with Paragon and the Toronto-based holding company Dundee Corporation, were the three original investors in the $640 million casino resort.</p>
<p>Paragon managed the facility for 10 years – back to when it was still called the Edgewater Casino – leading up to its massive renovation. But now the company wants out, leaving the other investors to hold a candle for the future of the casino.</p>
<p>“PBC believes that Parq Vancouver is positioned to become a central feature of the downtown entertainment district and will serve as further proof that Vancouver has become a global destination city” Paul Bouzanis, PBC’s president, said in a release.</p>
<p>Controversy and Bleeding Cash</p>
<p>One could hardly blame the Vegas-based company for wanting to pull the plug on the Parq experiment after less than two years.</p>
<p>Featuring two Marriott hotels, 72,000 square feet of gaming space, a 65,000-square-foot conference center, and a prime waterfront location, it was supposed to be a can’t-miss project.</p>
<p>The sale of Parq leaves Paragon with three properties. Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Lake Tahoe</p>

<p>Westgate Las Vegas — Nevada</p>
<p>After opening in the fall of 2017, the facility’s first year went relatively smoothly. Then came the Drake incident.</p>
<p>The Canadian rapper accused casino management of racial profiling when it refused to let him gamble there after a Vancouver concert, calling it the “worst run business I have ever witnessed” on an Instagram Post.</p>
<p>Casino officials would later apologize, but the bad press would continue for weeks.</p>
<p>Then, in November of last year, a report revealed that Parq had lost $108 million in 2018. Management acknowledged the poor financial situation, blaming it on British Columbia’s (BC) new anti-money-laundering rules.</p>
<p>The Wild West</p>
<p>Which brings us to the final reason that Paragon may be pulling up stake.</p>
<p>BC’s entire casino industry has been mired in controversy since last summer, when a special investigation revealed that international criminal organizations had been using BC casinos to launder money.</p>
<p>Initial estimations were that criminals had laundered some $100 million via gaming facilities, but a new report last week indicated that some $2 billion in criminal cash had in fact flowed through provincial casinos.</p>
<p>The PBC Group and Dundee Corporation will take over day-to-day operations of the casino from Paragaon.</p>
