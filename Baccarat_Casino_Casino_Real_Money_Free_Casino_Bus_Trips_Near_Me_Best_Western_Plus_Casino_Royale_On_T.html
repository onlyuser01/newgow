    <h1>Baccarat Casino Casino Real Money Free Casino Bus Trips Near Me Best Western Plus Casino Royale On T</h1>

<p>England vs United States is the final game of the day and the only one that‚Äôs scheduled for the afternoon (Eastern Time) on Friday, November 25. We think the game is really worth a watch, even if you‚Äôre not a fan of either of these selections.</p>
<p>The reason why we think this is going to be a real barnburner is that England players started their World Cup campaign in top gear. They destroyed Iran 6-2 in Round 1 and are determined to do something similar in the second round. The USMNT, however, mustn‚Äôt let that happen.</p>
<p>After failing to beat Wales, Team US‚Äôs chance of making the playoffs has reduced. Winning point(s) against favored England, however, would put them in a great situation. So, can they pull it off?</p>
<p>England vs United States Odds</p>

<p>Is It Really Coming Home This Time?</p>
<p>After witnessing their boys demolish Iran 6-2, England fans started singing ‚Äúfootball‚Äôs coming home.‚Äù But is it too early for celebrations? Even though the runners-up of the 2021 Euros aren‚Äôt seen as the no.1 favorites to win the trophy in Qatar, there are several things going in their favor.</p>
<p>First of all, Gareth Southgate‚Äôs tactics seem to work. That‚Äôs no brainer, knowing that the Three Lions have an exceptional roster in 2022. They got at least one elite player for every role on the field.</p>
<p>Another reason why we think they‚Äôre gonna go far is that the 2022 World Cup bracket goes in their favor. If they win Group B, they‚Äôre gonna play against the second-placed team from Group A, which is almost certainly going to be either Ecuador or Senegal.</p>

<p>The 2022 @FIFAWorldCup begins Sunday. Who do you have winning it all? üèÜ pic.twitter.com/vbW1Pb5hVr ‚Äî FOX 53 (@fox53wpgh) November 16, 2022</p>
<p>They‚Äôre stronger than both of those teams. If they beat Ecuador/Senegal in the Round of 16, their most likely opponent in the quarterfinal is going to be France. Given the fact that the reigning world champions are missing a number of key players ‚Äì Karim Benzema, N‚Äôgolo Kante, Paul Pogba, etc. ‚Äì England would stand a chance against them.</p>
<p>Then, in the semifinal, they‚Äôre likely to play against one of the following three teams ‚Äì Belgium, Portugal, or Germany. At this point, we think that England are better than each of those.</p>
<p>That said, England have an open road to the final, albeit only if they win Group B. So far, they‚Äôre on the good road to achieving that. In fact, beating the USMNT on Friday would get them very close to securing the no.1 spot.</p>
<p>USMNT Needs a Good Result</p>
<p>Even if they lose to England on Friday, the USMNT would still have a chance to qualify for the knockout stage. It‚Äôs because Wales too are likely to lose to England. The Welsh, however, are expected to beat Iran.</p>
<p>The US plays Iran in the final round and we assume the Americans will win as well. That said, a very likely scenario is that at the end of the group phase, the USMNT and Wales will have the same number of points. So, which team will finish in the no.2 spot in Group B, thus getting the ticket to the knockouts?</p>
<p>The answer is: the team with the better score differential. What this means is that the USMNT need to do all in their power not to get blown out by England on November 25. Can they do it?</p>
<p>England vs USMNT Prediction</p>
<p>We really doubt the USMNT can keep England‚Äôs offense from scoring on Friday. In fact, we‚Äôre sure the Three Lions will put away at least a couple of goals. America‚Äôs chance of getting a good result lies in fighting back.</p>
<p>With players like Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah, Team US does have the quality to score against England. Further, England‚Äôs Achille‚Äôs heel might be the defense, as evident from the fact that they conceded twice against Iran last Monday.</p>
<p>Picks: England to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
