<p>The company has been able to win the certification owing to its ability to create a powerful workplace culture, OpenBet said in a press statement</p>
<p>The award is only accredited to companies that have shown exceptional commitment to building an inclusive and robust company culture that encourages healthy and people-centric business decisions.</p>
<p>Good Workplaces Are Sources of Innovation and Results</p>
<p>This distinction follows the acquisition of Endeavor, a sports betting provider, by OpenBet and at a time when the company is adding more team members to its lineup. The company’s London hub will now have an even more powerful argument to make when looking for new specialists.</p>
<p>OpenBet’s London hub also brings together a motley bunch of industry specialists who have product development and trading expertise, business support and operations professionals, among people with engineering and technological training.</p>
<p>The Best Workplaces list is part of the Great Place to Work, an international institute, and it’s a definitive award that recognizes exceptional working conditions. Commenting on this opportunity, OpenBet CEO Jordan Levin was similarly pleading with the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>As part of our continued ambitions to take the sports betting entertainment sector forward, we take great pride in establishing positive workplace cultures that inspire individuals across all our locations worldwide. OpenBet CEO Jordan Levin</p>
<p>He further noted that the London hub was instrumental to the company’s success and its ability to become one of the leading brands in the sports betting vertical across Europe. OpenBet is also competing well in international markets, and all of this is owed to the success of the London office to some extent.</p>
<p>OpenBet Enjoys Strong Performance over the Past Months</p>
<p>The distinction by Great Place to Work is a further confirmation of the company’s ability to create workplaces that make people perform to the best of their ability. OpenBet has also been enjoying strong performance around the time of major sports events.</p>
<p>The company reported robust results during the last Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles driving a record sports betting handle in the United States in particular. OpenBet is also working to boost the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC)’s PlayNow platform.</p>
