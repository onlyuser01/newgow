<p>Gaming Innovation Group and Betsson Group are onto a good thing and they are nowhere near ready to throw in the towel just yet. The companies are extending their long-term partnership yet again that will cover platform and managed services across multiple jurisdictions and aspects of the industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the current extension of what has been a successful collaboration so far, GiG said that the alliance will carry on for at least another three years through the end of 2025.</p>
<p>GiG to Continue Powering Betsson Brands</p>
<p>As a result, Betsson will benefit from GiG’s advanced products for some of its flagship brands, including Rizk, Guts, Kaboo, and Thrills, along with ancillary brands. GiG is prepared to support Betsson’s growth across new markets where the potential for securing a sizeable market share is significant. GiG’s press release said that the company was capable of scaling partners’ brands in important targeted markets.</p>
<p>GiG CEO Richard Brown commented on the development and partnership between the companies so far, as well as what to expect ahead:</p>
<p>“The partnership will support and help to drive the two businesses’ growth in existing and new markets, increasing the diversification and market opportunities for both Betsson and GiG.” GiG CEO Richard Brown</p>
<p>GiG is currently undergoing a transition that is pivoting towards a pure B2B focus, Brown added. The news was similarly welcomed by Zecure Gaming’s commercial director, Andrew Valenzia. Zecure is owned by Betsson:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have extended our agreement with GiG for an additional period of three years. As a platform provider, GiG will be a key part of our road map for growth, and I am very confident in their ability to fuel our development in new and existing markets.” Zecure Gaming’s commercial director, Andrew Valenzia</p>
<p>GiG Busy Doubling Down on B2B Portfolio</p>
<p>GiG has been busy over the last 18 months, as by the company’s own testimony. The group focused on providing more business customers with the tools they need to take their businesses to the next level.</p>
<p>This includes partnerships with Matching Visions and Avento Group. The GiG Compliance tool has proven a particularly important tool in the arsenal of many firms looking to remain on regulators’ good side while scaling up their offers in sustainable ways.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Betsson has achieved its set Q4 targets even though it faced some setbacks. The company also took its offer live in Buenos Aires, both the city and province, marking the company’s latest move in the Latin American region.</p>
