    <h1>Mt Airy Casino Treasure Island Resort Casino Aqua Casino Casinos In Upper Michigan Philadelphia Casi</h1>

<p>Winning a jackpot at a casino undoubtedly brings excitement to people who are lucky enough to experience such a thing. Yet, some lucky casino visitors can have a rather unpleasant experience as they may be targeted by criminals. This is precisely the case of a woman who was playing at Ho-Chunk Gaming Madison, a premium casino located in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Celebrating New Year’s Eve, the woman visited the Madison casino. Upon leaving the venue with a sum of several thousand dollars, the woman was robbed. Exiting the casino along with her husband, the woman was approached by a stranger who asked for a ride.</p>
<p>The couple didn’t agree to give the person a lift. In an unexpected turn of events, the culprit grabbed the woman’s purse and using force, took it out of her hands. The robber then fled the scene on foot. A report released by the City of Madison Police Department does not reveal what sum was stolen during the incident.</p>
<p>According to the city’s Police Department, the incident dates back to the early hours of Monday morning. At approximately 2:15 AM, police responded to a call about a robbery at the 4000 block of Evan Acres Rd.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not the woman suffered any injuries due to the robbery. An investigation into the robbery is still ongoing. Police authorities are examining digital evidence related to the case. So far there is no information about a person suspected of the crime. No individuals have been arrested for the robbery at the time of writing.</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident dating back to Sunday, a 31-year-old Iowa woman was arrested. The arrest comes after an incident at the Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf in Bettendorf, Iowa. Charges against the 31-year-old include assault, as well as drug-related charges.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a man was taken into custody after gunshots were heard near the Las Vegas Strip, again on Sunday. The person allegedly discharged a firearm from an MGM Signature Towers balcony, an action that brought the city’s SWAT team along with 30 police cruisers.</p>
