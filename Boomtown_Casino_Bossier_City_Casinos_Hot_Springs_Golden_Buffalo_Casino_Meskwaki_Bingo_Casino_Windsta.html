<p>Currently, iRace Media is a leading company within the Asian region. Based in Singapore, it engages with business customers such as Tabcorp, Singapore Pools and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, among others, to help expand their presence in strategic markets.</p>
<p>iRace Media leverages different content services and a range of data, enabling it to develop interactive content. Its services involve translation of the operator’s content to make it suitable for different jurisdictions. Moreover, iRace Media produces the famous racing form guide in Asia, the award-winning “iRace” publication.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Is Expected to Propel PA Media’s Reach</p>
<p>Clive Marshall, PA Media’s CEO, shared the thrill and excitement of iRace Media’s boss. He explained that the company has been providing data and content for customers in the racing sector for more than 60 years. According to Marshall, with the takeover of iRace Media, PA Media will propel the reach of its services, engaging with new media partners, affiliates, bookmakers and rightsholders in the region.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of iRace Media allows us to expand our reach and services to rightsholders, bookmakers, affiliates and media partners in ever more relevant and creative ways, utilizing the power of our global racing database and distribution.“ Clive Marshall, CEO of PA Media Group</p>
<p>Elsewhere, other notable acquisitions took place.
