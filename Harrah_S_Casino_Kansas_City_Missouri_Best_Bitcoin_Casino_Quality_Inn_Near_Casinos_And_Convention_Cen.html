I am honored to be asked to provide insight at both events," he continued.</p>
<p>Rosander said that the topics and issues addressed at SBC events are of big importance to the future of the industry and that it was good to have a place to discuss and tackle those problems together. SBC CEO and founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity as well:</p>
<p>"A big part of the success of SBC’s conferences is attracting the leading experts to share their insights on the big issues shaping the future of the betting and gaming industry."</p>
