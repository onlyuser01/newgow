    <h1>Wheeling West Virginia Casino Wetumpka Casino Alabama Casino Boston Ma Horseshoe Hammond Casino Casi</h1>

<p>Maltese igaming entity and owner of successful gaming brands such as Lucky Casino and Swintt, Glitnor Group, has announced a significant “seven-figure” investment in North American affiliate website and company Time2play.com. This comes as part of the recent acquisition of KaFe Rocks, which consolidates Glitnor Group as one of the leading affiliate companies in the highly-valued North American gambling industry.</p>
<p>Glitnor Gets Involved with Time2play.com</p>
<p>Time2play.com is touted as a brand that presents readers and players with objective and thorough reviews of licensed gambling platforms across the United States. Glitnor considers the investment a smart move into consolidating its footprint in the highly-competitive market while cutting ahead of other already established affiliate brands in the market.</p>
<p>Time2play.com prides itself on a zero-favoritism policy which means that the website does not accept any input from casinos in determining the rankings of each individual brand. As a result, players and readers can make their own minds and go to the betting and gaming brands they like best, and think are the best fit.</p>
<p>The website combines user and professional reviewers’ experiences to ensure that the website provides up-to-date and objective information. Glitnor Group has confirmed its dedication to the North American market through the recent acquisition of KaFe Rocks and is likely to continue growing its presence in the igaming market in the region, and beyond.</p>
<p>Commenting on this move, Glitnor Group CEO David Flynn welcomed the opportunity to be involved with a leading igaming tool and platform:</p>
<p>Glitnor Group has always been very open about its ambitions to become the most entrepreneurial and fastest-growing business group in the iGaming industry – and our investment in Time2play.com is further proof of how serious we are about making in-roads in the hugely significant North American market. Glitnor Group CEO David Flynn</p>
<p>Achieving the Companies’ Shared Goals</p>
<p>He further expressed his confidence that the team behind Time2play will provide customers with all the information they are looking for. Informative, unbiased, and on-point content is what Flynn sees in Time2play that will help grow Glitnor’s own footprint in the future. Time2play co-founder Alexander Korsager commented on this fresh opportunity and said:</p>
<p>Teaming up with an organization the size of Glitnor Group is testament to the great work Time2play has been doing in the North American iGaming market and I firmly believe that together we can provide an even more valuable resource for all bettors in the US. Time2play co-founder Alexander Korsager</p>
<p>Korsager further argued that both Time2play and Glitnor have a shared vision of how the industry should develop and what consumers need. The pair will work closely together to achieve their shared goals and seek further expansion in one of the most promising global igaming markets, and beyond.</p>
