<p>Pushing to make a memorable entrance in the quick-evolving LatAm market, PressEnter has made a strategic move by adding former Betsson executive David Plumi to the team. Responsible for operating some of the most successful virtual casino brands on the planet, the Group didn’t want to leave its important LatAm launch to the hands of fate. Given the region’s undeniable potential for the industry, PressEnter has pulled out the big guns when hiring Plumi as its new regional managing director for Spain and LatAm.</p>
<p>Plumi, Ready to Harness His Experience and Make Impact</p>
<p>Plumi’s main responsibility will be able to work his magic and prepare the business and all of its brands for the big launch in Spain and the Latin American markets. For this, he will harness his impressive expertise and deep understanding of the Spanish-speaking markets and find the best people to join the new Spanish and LatAm teams.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, PressEnter changed the address of its headquarters to a Malta location. The Group is currently operating top-tier casino brands like JustSpin, 21.com, NeonVegas, UltraCasino, NitroCasino, and the fresh RapidCasino brand. In an attempt to follow the pattern that has guaranteed its success over the years, PressEnter plans to use Plumi’s 12 years of experience rocking senior management positions at heavyweight operators in the industry, including Betsson Group and Stars Group.</p>
<p>Plumi was also head of VIP &amp; casino &amp; poker product manager for Barcelona’s Sportium Apuestas Deportivas, the co-founder of Larry Casinos, and the Head of Affiliates &amp; Poker Product Manager for CIRSA.</p>
<p>Plumi, who obtained his master of business administration degree at the prestigious Innovation and Entrepreneurship Business School in Barcelona (IEBS), considers his appointment a “true honor.” He has also expressed his confidence about the Group’s brands turning into “firm player favorites”, similar to the success recorded in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The industry veteran is also looking forward to making a genuine impact in LatAm, a region with a huge potential that should be leveraged early on, while the markets are still growing. This way, PressEnter would build a powerful foundation for long-term development while closely complying with all regional regulations.</p>
<p>While Plumi has expressed his delight to become a part of the organization, PressEnter’s chief commercial officer Thomas Groven has also acknowledged that he would be the best person to lead the group’s drive into the region.</p>
<p>Groven described him as an “incredibly talented and passionate executive” with an unmatched, deep understanding of the gaming markets in the Spanish-speaking world. These features are essential for the position, given the numerous obstacles that still need to be cleared in the area.</p>
<p>This is only one of the many strategic moves that PressEnter has made in recent years to strengthen and expand its position in the market. Last November, the Group decided to change the name of its affiliate program to reflect its new identity and communicate “consumer trust”. How successful will PressEnter’s new LatAm launch be under the new Regional Managing Director’s wing remains to be seen.</p>
