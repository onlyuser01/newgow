<p>Renewing the license in Sweden marks a strategic achievement for the company that will continue to provide its leading games for customers within the market</p>
<p>Online content supplier for the casino industry Play’n GO announced it renewed its license in Sweden. The company unveiled Wednesday that it was able to acquire a Swedish business-to-business (B2B) license, allowing it to continue to provide its content to audiences in the country.</p>
<p>Besides enabling Play’n GO to continue to deliver content in Sweden, the license strengthens the company’s presence in the European iGaming sector. This license is particularly important for Play’n GO considering that Sweden is the country where the company was founded.</p>
<p>As a result, customers in the country will be able to enjoy Play’n GO’s latest hit Legion Gold, its most popular online slot game called Book of Dead, as well as other titles within its continuously growing portfolio of content.</p>
<p>Sweden Remains an Important Market for the Company</p>
<p>Magnus Olsson, Play’n GO’s chief commercial officer (CMO), explained that Sweden is a home market for the country. He pointed out that although the company has a growing global presence, it still remains committed to offering its leading content to customers in Sweden. “It’s extra special for us to receive one of the first licenses from the regulator Spelinspektionen,” added Olsson.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank Spelinspektionen for the swift granting of our license so early in the process, allowing us to continue leading from the front in supplying the safest, most entertaining casino experience for players in our home market of Sweden.“ Magnus Olsson, chief commercial officer for Play’n GO</p>
<p>The company’s chief commercial officer thanked the gambling regulator in the country, Spelinspektionen, for allowing Play’n GO to continue to provide its popular games that deliver safe and engaging entertainment to Swiss customers.</p>
<p>Olsson noted that the company is excited to continue to bring safe gaming experiences for customers as it has done in the last two decades. Finally, the CMO pointed out that Play’n GO’s content helps Swedish operators with player retention and delivers exciting experiences.</p>
<p>“Of course, we will continue to supply the most exciting and safe casino gaming experience to Swedish players, as we have done for nearly 20 years,“ added Olsson</p>
<p>The renewed license reaffirms Play’n GO’s commitment to offering its content to the European market. At the same time, it comes during a busy period for the company, as it recently expanded its presence in the US as well, by securing a license in Connecticut. That marked the fourth US license secured by the Swedish-founded iGaming operator. Previously, Play’n GO acquired licenses for strategic markets such as Michigan, New Jersey, as well as West Virginia.</p>
