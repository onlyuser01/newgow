<p>Gaming and software solutions provider International Game Technology (IGT) announced that the contract between its subsidiary, IGT Global Services Limited, and Société de la Loterie de la Suisse Romande has been extended.</p>
<p>Replace Back-End Solution</p>
<p>The agreement with Loterie Romande to extend the contract until 2031 stipulates that IGT will continue to power the lottery operator with its world-class lottery technology. In addition, IGT will deploy the back end of its iLottery system to replace Loterie Romande’s current system provider and enhance the overall player experience for the operator’s customers in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT’s Global Lottery chief operating officer, hailed the contract extension as the next phase in the “evolution in supplying Swiss lottery players with unrivaled experiences,” building on the long-term partnership between IGT and Loterie Romande.</p>
<p>“IGT’s sophisticated iLottery system will offer Loterie Romande a dynamic 360-degree player view to easily adapt to customer needs and wide-ranging modules to effectively manage and grow its iLottery program,” he concluded.</p>
<p>IGT’s iLottery solution will bring added security, dynamic scalability and reduced time to market for system enhancements due to its cloud technology that will allow Loterie Romande to migrate its digital system to the cloud.</p>
<p>Further, the system will allow faster and easier integration of data and insights to help enhance the overall player experience for the lottery operator, while its incorporated suite of comprehensive responsible gaming tools will help Loterie Romande comply with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Maximize Contributions to Good Causes</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Jean-Luc Moner-Banet, chief executive officer of Loterie Romande, outlined the key role IGT has been playing in the development of the Swiss-based lottery operator to date.</p>
<p>“IGT has partnered with Loterie Romande for nearly 30 years, supplying us with the most advanced lottery hardware, systems and services,” he said, adamant that this has enabled the operator to maximize its contributions to good causes in the French-speaking cantons in Switzerland.</p>
<p>On replacing Loterie Romande’s back-end system supplier, Moner-Banet said that the operator is convinced that IGT’s iLottery system will provide it with “faster access to player data and analytics” to help drive sales in a responsible way by allowing the operator to “offer the best player experience possible.”</p>
<p>As part of the contract, the primary provider of technology to eight of the world’s largest ten and 16 of the world’s top 25 lotteries will continue to provide Loterie Romande with its Aurora core lottery central system and a customized electronic lottery system, in addition to its iLottery back-end solution.</p>
<p>Loterie Romande is the latest lottery operator to deepen its relationship with IGT, following in the footsteps of Loto-Quebec which renewed its contract through 2027 last month.</p>
