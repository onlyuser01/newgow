<p>Octoplay, a leading supplier of online casino games, has achieved remarkable success with the company securing a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), one of the most respected and trusted regulators worldwide, Casino Guru News learned in a press release.</p>
<p>This will significantly expand Octoplay’s reach and boost its presence in markets worldwide, and specifically those that recognize the MGA’s stature. Apart from market boost, the license also indicates that Octoplay has been building products designed to meet the highest industry standards.</p>
<p>The company was only founded in October 2022, but it’s already making waves by building robust products marked by distinct graphics, maths, and overall user experience. Octoplay similarly deploys a dedicated proprietaryRGS platform that makes it easier for partner operators to gain access to remarkable titles with zero traction.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Octoplay Founder and CEO CarlEjlertsson said that his company’s suite of games is something that operators in the industry were keen to secure and deploy. He spoke also about the geographical significance of the new license.</p>
<p>"Securing our Malta license is a major step forward to achieving this, and we look forward to seeing our games land in the lobbies of popular online casino brands in markets across Europe and beyond," Ejlertsson said.</p>
<p>The company has been licensed in multiple markets around Europe and the world. Presently, Octoplay holds licenses from Spelinspektionen in Sweden as well as national regulators in Romania and the United Kingdom. The list goes on. Octoplay Commercial Director Nick Vuchev spoke at length about what was to follow because of this licensing as well.</p>
<p>He said that Octoplay remains committed to growing its geographical footprint and securing every possible license that establishes the company as a credible and trustworthy supplier, and partner. The MGA license has made a significant contribution towards this goal.</p>
<p>Therefore, other MGA licensed operators will now have the opportunity to tap into Octoplay’s expansive portfolio of games and truly benefit from the innovative gameplay and mechanics the company has been working tirelessly to introduce to the industry.</p>
<p>Octoplay has been recently recognized with an ISO 27001 certification reaffirming the company’s ability to deliver sound and safe products to the iGaming industry. The company has been making waves in the industry fast, with many successful releases, such as Sheep King, StarKingdom, and Lollicat, among many others.</p>
