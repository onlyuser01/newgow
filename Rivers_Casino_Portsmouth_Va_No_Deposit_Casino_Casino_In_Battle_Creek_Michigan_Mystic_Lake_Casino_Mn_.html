<p>Green Bay Packers Doing Great in Big Games in 2023</p>
<p>In their first season without Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback, the Green Bay Packers are doing surprisingly well. They’re 7-8 right now, with wins over some real heavyweights including the Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, they defeated the Carolina Panthers by a field goal. That wasn’t much of an achievement, but a win is a win. Still, they need to be concerned about the fact that they conceded 30 points against the Panthers whose offense is the fourth-worst in the league.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they did very well offensively, with quarterback Jordan Love going 23-for-36 for 312 yards and two touchdowns. Further, Chuba Hubbart, and Ihmir Smith-Marsette scored a rushing TD each.</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings Putting Their Hopes in Home Support</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings still have a chance to make the playoffs, but their recent form is what needs to worry them. They lost four of their last five games, with their only win happening against the Las Vegas Raiders in a game that finished with 3-0 on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>To be fair to the Vikings, they did put on a big fight in the last two games. They took the game with the Cincinnati Bengals to overtime, losing by a field goal in the end. In their most recent game, they lost to the in-form Detroit Lions by six points.</p>
<p>The Lions are the team they’ll take on in the final game week of the regular season. But that game won’t matter to them unless they beat the Packers on December 31. So, can they do it?</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>The Packers vs. Vikings New Year’s Eve game will be a real thriller. For both teams, this is a must-win game as the one that loses can say farewell to the playoffs. We expect both to go all-in on December 31, the result of which is that we might even see the game go to overtime.</p>
<p>We won’t see many risky moves in this game, with both teams probably focusing more on running the ball rather than passing. The result is that we probably won’t see too many touchdowns, which is why under 46.5 points is out pick. Our pick for the Packers vs. Vikings game-winner is Minnesota.</p>
<p>Picks: Minnesota Vikings &amp; Under 46.5 Points</p>
