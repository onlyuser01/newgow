<p>The developer will receive access to diverse new markets, getting the chance to showcase the global appeal of its offerings</p>
<p>Altenar’s deal with a global operator and platform provider like Atomo Gaming should bolster both companies and create new growth opportunities. The developer has gathered substantial momentum in 2023, expanding across Latin America and the Balkans. Atomo will benefit from Altenar’s comprehensive multi-channel software solutions, further diversifying its offerings.</p>
<p>Atomo Empowers Its Rapid Global Expansion</p>
<p>According to the new partnership, Altenar will contribute its comprehensive multi-channel solution, focusing on the Latin American market with virtual sports, lottery, and quiniela wagering solutions. Atomo Gaming CEO Ramón Monrós noted that the new technology would significantly bolster the company’s global expansion, ensuring online and retail success.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to secure a new deal with Altenar to provide its innovative sportsbook technology as part of our omnichannel offering. Ramón Monrós, Atomo Gaming CEO</p>
<p>Atomo’s rapid growth in the B2B and B2C sectors has strengthened the company’s global leadership position. The platform provider has recently decided to diversify, launching several flagship stores and operator brands to solidify its market position in select regions. Such rapid growth necessitates a robust suite of software and sportsbook solutions, making the partnership with Altenar a natural progression of Atomo’s ambitions.</p>
<p>Altenar’s Solutions Rise in Popularity</p>
<p>The deal perfectly fits Altenar’s strategy, leveraging its familiarity with the LatAm market. The company will significantly expand its reach, launching with Atomo’s operator partners and its brands, spanning three continents. Altenar account manager George Mavridis commented that the partnership would enable Atomo to scale its success and pave the way for further cooperation.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with Atomo Gaming to offer our award-winning sportsbook to a host of diverse markets. George Mavridis, Altenar account manager</p>
<p>With the new agreement, Altenar maintains the impressive momentum it has been building up since the start of the year. In April, the company further solidified its presence in the Latin American market thanks to a deal with popular sports betting operator GanaPlay. The developer’s dedication to creating award-winning solutions and its focus on expansion in the area has made it a go-to provider for many regional operators.</p>
<p>Altenar’s solutions have also proven their competitiveness on a global scale. The company’s 13 licenses for leading global markets have allowed its products to demonstrate their worth across diverse jurisdictions. The March agreement with Bulgarian operator BetMarket is a testament to the Altenar solutions’ universal appeal, showcasing the company’s untapped growth potential.</p>
