    <h1>California Casino Margaritaville Casino Shreveport 4 Queens Casino Ac Casino Map Lucky Legend Casino</h1>

<p>I checked playing with 80 casinos, at one point I had to have a second phone for them, but I don't do that anymore, I have a few proven constants that I am sure of, each has some games that I play every day, not repetitive.</p>
<p>E.g. Miss joker in total casino</p>
<p>Or Alien or something in Winmechance, and of course I play on new ones and it's rare that I come across something normal.</p>
<p>Every other casino and even more often a scam, in the last three weeks alone, 2 have stolen my winnings</p>
<p>spincity 5000 euros</p>
<p>Casinomega PLN 10,000</p>
<p>But I have my favorites for games, some casinos are unique and unique, I know two that are unfortunately not trustworthy and it is better not to deposit there, and these two casinos would easily be among the top if they gave players a fair approach. Because they are not repeatable, e.g. deepdeep, it's a pity this casino has games, in my opinion it would be one of the best. Luckyhipoo, I also liked them very much.</p>
<p>In the summer I went to Gizycko in Poland and I was bored in the hotel. After two days I played 5 games at once, bandit slottica, the first one I won a lot, even a lot, but when you place a withdrawal order and play with what's left, they immediately cancel the withdrawal, just like when you take a bonus or you snore at night. Well, that's how it started, I had such a winning streak that I found an advertisement in my e-mail for a casino on.biegu to play somewhere and I think I got 9,000 euros or pounds there. In this frenzy, later I left the casino with the winnings, my phone doesn't save the history and I didn't know where the 9,000 was, I was looking for it for a month and it was on Winmechance. It's such a funny story, but each approach was a hit at the expense of 1,300 euros, so it's worth trying new ones</p>
<p>To make this story not too perfect, I would like to add that, unfortunately, I had the most winnings on slottica, several tens of thousands, I even got a grand prize and along the way I managed to withdraw two EUR 550 from it and the first installment was received by me after 12 days where they have a time limit for three</p>
