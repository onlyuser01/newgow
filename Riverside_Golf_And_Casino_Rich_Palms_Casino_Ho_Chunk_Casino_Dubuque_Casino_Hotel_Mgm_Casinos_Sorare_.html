    <h1>Riverside Golf And Casino Rich Palms Casino Ho Chunk Casino Dubuque Casino Hotel Mgm Casinos Sorare</h1>

<p>Sorare and AC Milan have announced an exciting multi-year deal in which the company that mixes fantasy sports with digital collectibles will turn into the Italian club’s official Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) fantasy football partner. The exclusive partnership will benefit both parties, along with the over 500 million AC Milan fans spread all over the world.</p>
<p>AC Milan Will Enjoy a Fresh Digital Tool for Fan Engagement</p>
<p>Passionate gamers and fans of the sport from all parts of the world will benefit from a brand new platform where they will be allowed to share and celebrate their common passion while collecting, trading, and playing using licensed digital cards. AC Milan will also generate a new source of new revenue. This will be possible by setting up a fresh category for game licenses in the form of NFT licensing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deal perfectly matches the club’s current Web 3.0 strategy, helping it reach deeper into the NFT universe by collaborating with some of the best people who can create one-of-a-kind digital experiences for fans. Sorare has surpassed the two million figure in terms of global users. It has also been proudly coordinating over 260 partnerships with important sports organizations since its launch four years ago. The new partnership will become active starting the 2022/23 season.</p>
<p>Gaming Experience Fuelled by Passion</p>
<p>Sorare’s head of business development Michael Meltzer talked about the new agreement as a means of “building a gaming experience fueled by passion” that will allow fans to get in touch with football and the global fans of the sport. Meltzer also called the football club a legendary one. AC Milan’s chief revenue officer Casper Stylsvig welcomed Sorare into their “exclusive family of Premium Partners”. He added the new agreement marked “the beginning of a new journey with an exciting and young brand that is at the forefront of the NFT revolution”. Calling itself an innovative club, AC Milan is eager to start exploring the NFT field while using a “clear strategy” with the goal of providing over 500 million fans “exciting additional ways to engage” with the club.</p>
<p>At the end of April, two Dutch soccer players were accused of insider trading on the Sorare platform, even though no real crime was actually committed according to Denmark’s existing gambling regulations. AC Milan has been founded in Milan in 1899 and it recently secured its 19th Italian championship title during the last round of the 2021/2022 season.</p>
