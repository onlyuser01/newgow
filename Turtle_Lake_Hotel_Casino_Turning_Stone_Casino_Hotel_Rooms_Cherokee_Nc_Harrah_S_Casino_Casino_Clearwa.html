    <h1>Turtle Lake Hotel Casino Turning Stone Casino Hotel Rooms Cherokee Nc Harrah S Casino Casino Clearwa</h1>

<p>That has nothing to do with a constructive opinion boy, that's called not respecting other opinions and insulting them.</p>
<p>You label people as dumb and talk anything about speaking your mind?</p>
<p>Where did I initially offend someone that my words push on your pathetic buttons so much that you have a problem and offend people all the time?</p>
<p>What you say is correct and what others say is rubbish as described in your words?</p>
<p>Casino has been keeping people waiting for 1 month &amp; every player is entitled to full compensation.</p>
<p>You say it's stupid to ask such questions?</p>
<p>The only one who is stupid here is you and a lot of people seem to agree with me.</p>
<p>Since the casino has no problems with receiving deposits, but when it comes to withdrawals, are there problems? Sure, of course.</p>
<p>The addiction has nothing to do with many players losing their winnings, which again you fantasize about.</p>
<p>Many waited more than 2 weeks and had the feeling that nothing was coming and simply downplayed everything.</p>
<p>If the casino is having problems with withdrawals they should stop ALL payments until the problem is fixed period otherwise EVERYONE has the right to speak their mind without some wannabe PC king insulting people as stupid.</p>
<p>Receiving deposits and at the same time making people wait 4 weeks for withdrawals has nothing to do with problems like they claim.</p>
<p>All of the questions I asked above are legitimate and I donâ€™t give a damn about your constructive would-be criticism, because you insulted people indirectly at first and then directly and came up with sayings like, for example, "You are far removed from reality, you you're stupid, you just talk rubbish".</p>
<p>You just insult who should take you joker seriously.</p>
<p>And if you can't understand such statements from me, then that's not my problem. "Of course you can deal with your childish comments.</p>
<p>But don't be cowardly behind your PC with your insults while you label others as stupid.</p>
<p>In your comments, the sentence " you are mentally (in good German) so broken is really common, the only mentally broken guy is you, nobody else.</p>
<p>Now just annoying someone else and is good. You said what you think and I don't take you seriously anymore.</p>
<p>If I stand up for the players in the future, you just don't feel addressed and that's good ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>you seem to have bigger problems than anyone here.</p>
<p>Learn respect otherwise don't expect any.</p>
