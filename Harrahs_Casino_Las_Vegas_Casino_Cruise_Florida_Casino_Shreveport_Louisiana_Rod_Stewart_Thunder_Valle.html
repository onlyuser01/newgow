    <h1>Harrahs Casino Las Vegas Casino Cruise Florida Casino Shreveport Louisiana Rod Stewart Thunder Valle</h1>

<p>The leading publisher of innovative online gambling games, Yggdrasil, announced the release of a new slot game introduced in collaboration with Peter &amp; Sons, the unique game development studio. The new slot game called Barbarossa DoubleMax, takes the players on a pirate’s adventure at sea.</p>
<p>The game offers quality graphics and uses symbols that include a compass, an anchor and muskets. Additionally, the game features different male and female pirate characters as symbols. Supercharged by Yggdrasil’s famous DoubleMax Game Engagement Mechanic (GEM), the new slot game grants players a chance to win impressive cash prizes.</p>
<p>What’s more, Barbarossa DoubleMax is powered by the company’s state-of-the-art technology called GATI. The innovative technology allows Yggdrasil to quickly deploy this game for different markets. This, in turn, brings benefits for the operators that can expand quickly their portfolio of games.</p>

<p>The New Game Is the Result of a Collaboration between Yggdrasil and Peter &amp; Sons</p>
<p>Yann Bautista, Peter &amp; Sons’ business development manager, acknowledged that it was exciting to collaborate with Yggdrasil for the development of games such as Barbarossa DoubleMax. He outlined that the collaboration with the leading publisher underlines the company’s commitment to delivering thrilling experiences.</p>
<p>“Working alongside Yggdrasil to develop new titles like Barbarossa DoubleMax has been fantastic for us as we continue our mission to deliver thrilling experiences and great artwork to players around the globe.“ Yann Bautista, business development manager at Peter &amp; Sons</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product &amp; programs was similarly delighted about the partnership with Peter &amp; Sons that resulted in the release of the new pirate-themed slot game. “It’s another winning title that we truly believe will succeed thanks to its excellent features and mechanics, especially the DoubleMax GEM,” he said.</p>
<p>Lucky players of the new pirate-themed slot game can tap into huge prizes of up to 20,000x of their bet. Landing three scatter symbols awards the players seven free spins. During that round, every two additional scatters help bring two more free spins. According to Yggdrasil, there’s also an “opportunity for Multiplier Jumps to activate randomly at any time, seeing the game’s win multiplier jump up one position and increasing the size of wins.”</p>
<p>Additionally, players can buy their way into the bonus action by paying an x0.25 on their bet for a double chance of hitting free spins. On the other hand, they can also pay x100 to directly tap into the free spins bonus round that offers seven free spins.</p>
