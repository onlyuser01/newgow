<p>Livespins and Hub88 have formed a new content distribution alliance that will allow the former to bring its socially charged live casino slots with more than 150 operators worldwide that are currently part of the Hub88’s network.</p>
<p>Livespins makes for a fantastic addition to any operator’s offering as it helps build experiences that go well beyond traditional gameplay. Livespins effectively allow streamers and spectators to interact and place wagers on the outcome of games together.</p>
<p>Hub88 and Livespins Embark to Bring More Innovative Slot Gameplay</p>
<p>The cutting-edge live-streaming platform has made it possible to boost engagement with players by delivering them precisely what they want and expect. The shared experience between players, streamers, and viewers will now be brought to the next level thanks to this timely partnership which will see Livespins and Hub88 collaborate to elevate the content offering at 150+ operators.</p>
<p>Livespins also brings games from a number of prominent partners as the platform needs partner studios to have its streamers play the games and engage with players who want to share alongside the streamers. Among those studios are Relax Gaming, Yggdrasil, and iSoftBet all of which have seen the potential of Livespins and embraced it.</p>
<p>Hub88 is happy to see Livespins integrated with its offer and across partner casino operators in what is a seamless and intuitive way. This has helped bring a host of features that are immediately available to the casinos.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen hailed this partnership for its groundbreaking nature and said that Livespins stands to benefit immensely from making its product immediately known to more than 150 operators around the world and their audiences. He also noted that there was significant interest in streamed gaming:</p>
<p>The demand for casino and slot streaming is at an all-time high, and with Livespins operators can provide this directly to their players in a responsible and compliant way. Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen</p>
<p>Pedersen is optimistic about the future, too, arguing that Livespins will emerge as its own casino game category before long, owing to the innovativeness of the gameplay and approach to slot gaming in general. Hub88 head Ollie Castleman was similarly thrilled with the opportunity to provide clients with cutting-edge innovation and supply operators with slot solutions that few other companies can provide.</p>
<p>“It is engaging, highly entertaining, interactive, and just incredibly fun – all things that players now expect from an online casino,” Castleman said.</p>
