<p>Online slot maker with a focus on redefining excellence in iGaming and developing high-quality games, DragonGaming, has launched Touchdown Blitz, the “ultimate crash game inspired by the NFL.”</p>
<p>The electrifying gaming experience starts during the final seconds of what appears to be an intense Super Bowl showdown.</p>
<p>The ball is in the possession of the Dragons. The team is a few points down, and they are trying to change the course of the game in just a split second and turn the outcome in their favor. Will they make it?</p>
<p>Touchdown Blitz Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Volatility : Medium</p>
<p>: Medium RTP : 97%</p>
<p>: 97% Min/Max bet : 0.10/100</p>
<p>: 0.10/100 Max multiplier : 10,000x</p>
<p>: 10,000x Release date: February 1, 2024</p>
<p>x10,000 Max Win Potential</p>
<p>Touchdown Blitz is not a standard slot game. It introduces both seasoned players and newcomers to the online slots world to a one-of-a-kind experience that smartly mixes the thrills of the exciting gameplay with mesmerizing graphics, and the opportunity to hit a big win.</p>
<p>The maximum win potential is set at x10,000 and players can engage in the sports-themed gameplay with a minimum bet of €0.10 and a maximum bet of €100.</p>
<p>The exhilarating experience is backed by state-of-the-art mechanics that the studio is known for, intertwined with the world of intense virtual sports, packing anticipation, excitement, skill, and chance during each new spin.</p>
<p>Players looking for a brand new take on the slot universe as they know it will embark on a dynamic adventure as soon as the football is seen soaring through the field and starts to fly.</p>
<p>This will also automatically trigger the bet’s multiplier to start growing in size at a higher intensity. The longer the football remains in the air, the higher the multiplier becomes, potentially reaching its maximum value.</p>
<p>Time to Decide – the Clock Is Ticking!</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the ball cannot suddenly crash down. This can occur before the game begins or at any time during the game, which makes Touchdown Blitz particularly exciting.</p>
<p>This is where the main trait of the crash game comes into the picture: players are empowered to be in full control of their choices. They need to decide whether they would like to immediately cash out and claim a smaller prize or let the football travel for longer and anxiously attempt to score a more generous reward.</p>
<p>The catch is that the longer they decide to wait, the higher the risk of the ball fumbling, leaving them with no win to scoop up.</p>
<p>The innovative gameplay is expected to push the boundaries of the iGaming world while the excellent graphics, sounds, and big win potential are likely to quickly turn Touchdown Blitz into a player-favorite.</p>
<p>Last September, the studio that champions innovative, immersive, and rewarding experiences released Blackjack Perfect Pairs &amp; 21+3, a new table game expected to spice up its popular Blackjack Deluxe game, following the launch of Asian-themed Kung Food Panda slot in July.</p>
