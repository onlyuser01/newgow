<p>Entain, one of the world’s largest sports betting and gaming groups, prepares to make a foray into German iGaming after receiving a new license. The company will be allowed to operate iGaming and poker through some of its brands.</p>
<p>Entain Will Offer Online Gaming and Poker</p>
<p>The State Administrative Office of Saxony-Anhalt which currently regulates gambling licensing licensed a few of Entain’s brands. In total, the company received three gaming licenses and two online poker ones. Thanks to that, the gambling juggernaut will be allowed to offer gaming through three of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>As announced by Entain, the company will be able to offer gaming through its bwin, Ladbrokes and Sportingbet brands. Meanwhile, only the bwin and Sportingbet brands would be allowed to offer online poker to German players.</p>
<p>This licensing is not only big news for Entain but also a monumental development in the German market as Entain will now be the first company that can offer online poker to local gamblers. The German regulator has been very prudent when licensing companies and has been very careful with the operators it lets in.</p>
<p>The Company Is Thrilled to Enter the German Market</p>
<p>Robert Hoskin, the chief governance officer of Entain, spoke about the new licenses and the opportunity to Enter Germany. He said that his team is excited about joining the regulated German market, which will enable the company’s brands to offer online gaming and poker to fans in the country. Hoskin added that Entain believes its foray into the market to be an important move toward Germany’s ambitions of creating a healthy, sustainable and fully-regulated online gaming and betting market.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to now have our licenses for gaming and poker services in the regulated German market, enabling us to offer and market them to our customers. It is an important and welcome step towards achieving the goal of a fully regulated online betting and gaming market in Germany. Robert Hoskin, chief governance officer, Entain</p>
<p>He praised the regulatory efforts of the authorities, saying that the enforcement of carefully thought-out regulations is the surest way to prevent the dangerous black market from taking over.</p>
<p>In other news, Entain recently also expanded its presence to Africa. The company’s bwin brand was licensed in the country, allowing the operator to launch its offerings. Entain vowed to be considerate to the local economy, support tourism and fight against problem gambling. To that end, the global operator took it upon itself to promote the highly efficient BetBlocker solution in Zambia.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the operator probed into the passions and patriotism of sports betting fans across the world.</p>
