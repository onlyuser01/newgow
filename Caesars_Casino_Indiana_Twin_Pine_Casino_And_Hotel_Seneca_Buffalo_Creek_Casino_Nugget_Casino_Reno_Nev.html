    <h1>Caesars Casino Indiana Twin Pine Casino And Hotel Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino Nugget Casino Reno Nev</h1>

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Played this week first time , deposit money with my debit card you can use it as a creditcard without real credit . So in South Africa the number is at the back . Played and won 112.000 . Played till 89000 Rand then I wanted to withdraw 80.000 Rand . They keep refusing to verification of my debit card . The number at the back is used sent them really everything. From statements to letters . They keep rejecting my withdraw. Then they wanted me a letter stated that I use that card . They wanted the first 4 and last 6 numbers from my debit ( Mastercard ) in bankstatements you can see the last for digits of the card linked on my bankaccount . Then on one day I played ( because my bank said they don’t give statement like that. :so no balance on zero . I have all the relevant emails . Then I played with a new card …. Removed old card ! Then I saw they do a cash back on live playing / roulette games . They do cash on Wednesday ( the day I deposit and lost a lot . Now they told me live roulette isn’t live .. so no cash back .</p>
<p>Saw some reviews Abd it’s more or like the same . They give you some useless spins as a gift .</p>
<p>I feel trapped .. I tried 6 times to withdraw 80.000 Rand last week . Yes I know why I played on zero that’s my fault . But this wouldn’t be happens if they just gave my money …. Debit cards we all now are not as credit cards with different statements. Last night I closed account . But the whole cash back on Wednesday was irritating me …. So I ask them to reopen . Now suddenly they say do you still want you’re verification on you’re account . I have now noticed my account is ok . But there is a 10 %cash back on Wednesday… let’s see how that’s going to be … meanwhile I lost over 150.000 Rand South Africa to get things sorted . New situation 17 April 2023 …. Did a deposit for 800 Rand .. went of my account but never received… that constantly waiting for either deposit or previous is just not fun . So yeah there we go again</p>
<p>Update :</p>
<p>They won’t answer … blocked on live chat ! So my money is just gone .</p>
<p>Don’t understand why they score so high .</p>
<p>Update : they keep sending now the same text about that you for you’re contact bla bla bla …</p>
<p>I really think this casino needs to be under review ..11times 1 ⭐️ …. They says something!</p>
<p>Even the same complaint… yes I was so stupid to play again .</p>
<p>Zero update … keep telling not to worry ! But meanwhile we don’t know ….. no worries about the money . Also went to my bank . It went from my account to other account . Very clear … but the casino doesn’t know the bankaccount . In SA you need to do three verification with you’re phone to sent money …</p>
<p>Update : zero….. please wait ! About a 800 ZAR €40 ….. special department is busy with it .</p>
<p>20 April</p>
<p>21 April ….</p>
<p>Now it’s a principal thing …</p>
<p>There standard answers are we are busy , high priority….special department is busy .</p>
<p>So this money is gone ….. .</p>
<p>Update . Received on account the 800 RAND instead back to my bank .</p>
<p>Put yeah ….no excuse no nothing … i played the account .. . So yeah after many days the money was there …. But zero excuse</p>
