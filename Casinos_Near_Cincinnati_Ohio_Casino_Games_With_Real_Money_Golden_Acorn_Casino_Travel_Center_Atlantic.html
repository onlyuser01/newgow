<p>Svenska Spel Sport and Casino has added to its constantly growing portfolio of online casino games that will now feature select titles from RAW Group, a creator of original content for the sector, and an aggregator solution that empowers suppliers and operators.</p>
<p>The partnership between the two covers the RAW Arena aggregator platform which will bring a selection of titles that come from only top-tier suppliers that have been vetted carefully by RAW. The platform itself was introduced in April 2022 and has been a success ever since, securing one prominent partnership after the next.</p>
<p>Additionally, RAW is author of some unique gameplay features, such as SuperTracks and SuperSlice, establishing the company’s credentials as a capable designer of innovative content for the sector. Among the games that Svenska Sport and Casino players can enjoy as of right now are such titles as Joker &amp;The Thief SuperSlice, Mad Joker SuperSlice, Lucky McGree’s SuperSlice Swirl, and more.</p>
<p>The SuperSlice feature essentially replaces the traditional slot reels with wheels, and the company’s signature SuperTracks engine uses tracks to pay out winnings to players, changing the status quo as the company progresses forward with fresh titles.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino Head of Online Casino Niklas Örtbrant welcomed the opportunity to see his company team up with a prominent supplier and aggregator. He noted that as a prominent brand in iGaming, Svenska Spel had an obligation to be at the cutting-edge of the industry and bring to players the type of products that they seek out or even didn’t know existed.</p>
<p>"In RAW, we have a content partner that is completely reinventing casino content with mechanics that stand out. This difference is something that we and our players are seeking, which in turn makes this one of our most important integrations to date," Örtbrant noted.</p>
<p>RAW Group CEO Tom Wood was similarly pleased to have the chance to introduce the company’s product portfolio with yet another prominent and important gaming operator. Wood said that there was "tremendous demand" for "genuinely fresh content," and didn’t miss to note that this is precisely what RAW is about.</p>
<p>Trusted and established, the RAW Arena an RAW Group products are there to help elevate the experience for both players and operators, with Svenska Sport and Casino now about to benefit as well. Earlier this year, Push Gaming also signed up a similar partnership with the operator, introducing its titles locally for the very first time.</p>
<p>As to the operator’s sportsbook, the company recently updated and strengthened its retail and online offer with Kambi Group, a proven supplier in the vertical.</p>
