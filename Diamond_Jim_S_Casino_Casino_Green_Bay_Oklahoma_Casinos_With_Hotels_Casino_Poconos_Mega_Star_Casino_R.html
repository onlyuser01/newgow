<p>Blender Blitz has decided to kickstart the summer with a tropical title that will send players straight into the vacay mood. The game does an excellent job at evoking summer vacation vibes with the image of a sunny beach, a cruise ship in the distance, and other carefully chosen graphic elements. The 5×3 reels are filled with colorful fruit symbols that can be mixed and blended to create the most delicious summer smoothies. The relaxed atmosphere is nicely rounded up by a couple of crabs walking around the beach for an even more authentic imagery.</p>
<p>How to Play &amp; Win Blender Blitz</p>
<p>The game features an autospin option with an unlimited number of auto spins as well as the turbo spin mode. This enables even faster action on the reels. To win the game, players need to hit at least one of the 243 available paylines on the grid. To activate a payline, players must land matching symbols in any position across a minimum of three adjacent reels, from left to right.</p>
<p>Kiwi symbols pay 0.5x the bet for three matching symbols on a single payline. Smoothie blender symbols pay 25x the bet for five matching symbols on the payline.</p>
<p>The game also has an Eliminator Symbol. This symbol is represented by a knife that cuts through the fruit symbols on the grid. In return, all low-paying and mid-paying symbols are instantly removed from the reels for the remainder of the round. The same knife symbol also destroys all symbols, triggering the Free Spins round. During the Free Spins, a Super Spin can pop up or all lives can be list. Lives are lost during non-winning spins. An extra life symbol is found on the fifth reel during the Free Spins round. The symbol gives players between one and three additional lives, depending on the number shown on the symbol.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief product officer called Blender Blitz a “refreshing and dynamic” game with juicy content and intuitive gameplay. In mid-June, the company announced it would enter the Spanish iGaming next to Entain and launch 30 of its top-tier games with Entain’s prestigious partycasino, partypoker, and bwin brands. At the beginning of March, Relax Gaming added Intouch games to its aggregator platform.</p>
