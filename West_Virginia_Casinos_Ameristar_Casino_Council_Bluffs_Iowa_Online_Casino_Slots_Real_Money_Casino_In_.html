    <h1>West Virginia Casinos Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs Iowa Online Casino Slots Real Money Casino In</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela,</p>
<p>I played with first deposit bonus.</p>
<p>This is the only email I received from the casino (they still have not replied to my email where I asked for the explanation of their actions):</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that the way you are playing with your funds is aimed at abusing the bonus to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>We have therefore confiscated the bonus and winnings from it and returned you initial deposit.</p>
<p>You will need to turn this over 3 times and will then be able to withdraw any funds.</p>
<p>Please note that if we find a repeat of bonus abuse in the future,we reserve the right to close your account and keep any funds in there at the time.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Jamie</p>

<p>I tried to find the definition of the "bonus abuse" at the Blizz.io website. Below is the only time the word abuse is mentioned on their website:</p>
<p>7.6. blizz.io will review all player Accounts and classify them at its discretion. Once a player is classified as a "bonus hunter" or "bonus abuser", all winnings and bonuses will be void and the Account will be suspended and the payment not processed.</p>
<p>So, I, as I player, have no any information about what constitute bonus abuse, but the casino, based on their own understanding of this word , have a right to confiscate any winnings from me.</p>
<p>Again, I played regular slots (allowed ones) and have not violated any rules as they are stated on the website.</p>
