    <h1>Riverside Casino Golf Resort Iowa Casino Harrah S San Diego Casino Background Cash Casino Jake S 58</h1>

<p>On 01/03/2024 I requested 4 withdrawals of $2500 each as apparently there is a withdrawal limit of $2500 per withdrawal even though their terms and conditions clearly state no withdrawal limits. I sent in all of my documents and got verified prior to ever playing there as I've played at other casinos and know the drill when it comes to being able to cashout if you get lucky enough to win. You cannot request a withdrawal unless you are verified. You get like an error that says that you need to get verified and provide whatever documents they may be asking for prior to requesting your first cashout. I had already done it, but fine, I did it again and once again my account showed approved and verified. When I submitted the requests, it said it would take up to 5 business days and they would reach out if there were any problems. I waited a week and contacted them being told they needed a picture of the front and back of one of my credit cards that I had already sent in when I started playing months ago. The verification system wouldn't ake the pictures of the card saying that they already had pictures of the card. After trying a couple more times and getting the same result, I contacted online chat and was told that they needed pics of the card once again. I told the representative about not being able to upload them becuase they had already been uploaded, She argued back and forth with me for a few minutes and then asked me to hold for a minute. When she came back she said that she had good news. She had just gotten the response from the verification team and payout team and they have everything the need, I am good to go. A few more days passed, so I contacted them again. This time I was once again told by the first person that they needed a pic of that same credit card. I was told by another person that they had everything but there was a delay in payouts. Another one told me that they don't accept my bank of america account for wires (later the same person told me that they submitted my wire information for my bank account again to the payout team. this is the same bank account that:</p>
<p>I had to enter all wire informatoin to request the wire transfer. Was then told that they had no information on the account and needed all information including a statement. Then said they don't have any of the information again. Then said they don't accept bank of america advantage accounts. Then said that they submitted the bank of america advantage account information for wire to the payout team (even though I was told less than an hour prior to that that it wasn't accepted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I had told them that sending a check would be fine also at which time I was told that a check would not be possible. I asked why but I got no reason. I have gotten payouts from other casino's via check, including casinos out of country with foreign checks with no problem, so I'm thinking another stall technique. My VIP casino host was supposed to reach out to me 3 days ago and let me know what way the payout team had decided was best to pay me my winnings and then get the payments expedited. I have not heard from her, she doesn't respond to my emails, and she is never available when I try to get a hold of her on live chat. I have spent thousands at this casino and think they are trying to play me üôÅ The username entered below is what it shows under username in my profile, but the one I chose when i signed up was Sillygirl46.</p>
