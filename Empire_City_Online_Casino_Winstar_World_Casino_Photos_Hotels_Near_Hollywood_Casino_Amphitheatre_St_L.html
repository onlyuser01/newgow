    <h1>Empire City Online Casino Winstar World Casino Photos Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St L</h1>

<p>Dear garciaoliverjavier0,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments can complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos take KYC lightly and the casino has the right to verify every method used for deposits made in the casino.</p>
<p>Could you please explain what payment method you used to deposit in the casino on the 20th of December?</p>
<p>Have you submitted documents concerning this deposit to the casino as requested?</p>
<p>What response have you received from the casino?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
