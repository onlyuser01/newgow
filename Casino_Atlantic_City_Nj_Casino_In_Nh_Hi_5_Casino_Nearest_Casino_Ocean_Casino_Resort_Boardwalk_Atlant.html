<p>Commenting on the content deal, Push Gaming’s director of new business and markets, Fiona Hickey, outlined the importance of the partnership for the gaming provider and its global ambitions, hailing the magnitude of the deal and the established market position the company’s new partner has.</p>
<p>“Getting a deal of this magnitude over the line is fantastic news for Push and our growth plans,” Hickey said, highlighting that bet365 “is a brand that needs little introduction” and the deal with them “is a sign” of Push Gaming’s current ambitions as the business continues to expand into new markets.</p>

<p>The content deal with bet365 is the latest in a series of significant agreements signed by the games supplier that was acquired by MGM Resorts’ subsidiary LeoVegas in May.</p>

<p>In April, Push Gaming expanded its presence in the Dutch gaming market via an agreement with Kindred Group to power the group’s online casino offering with its latest slot title, Crystal Catcher. Following the initial success of the title with Kindred, three months later Push Gaming released the game for all operator partners.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Push Gaming added another game to its portfolio, Razor Returns, a sequel to the provider’s popular title, Razor Shark.</p>
