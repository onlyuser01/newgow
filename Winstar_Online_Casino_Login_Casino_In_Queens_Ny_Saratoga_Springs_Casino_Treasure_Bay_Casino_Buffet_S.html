<p>Blueprint Gaming has appointed Nick Wright as the company’s new Chief Commercial Officer. This move will strengthen the supplier and studio’s leadership team and allow it to continue to pursue its ambitious goals over the coming months.</p>
<p>Wright is an experienced individual who is well-versed in Blueprint’s company culture and is one of the most prominent executives in the online gambling industry. He is coming from a position as SVP Commercial Content for Bally’s Corporation and he was also Group Head of Business Development for Gamesys before that.</p>
<p>Overall, his experience has taken him across a number of well-established and successful brands in the industry – a success to which he contributed himself. Among his other companies in his curriculum vitae are such entities as Playtech and Amaya Gaming.</p>
<p>His most recent appointment will be about helping Blueprint Gaming pursue its strategic goals, and his focus will lie in the United Kingdom and internationally. Blueprint Gaming is keen to grow its footprint locally as much as it is to expand across the world.</p>
<p>As CCO, Wright commented on his appointment and said that he was very excited to be joining what he saw as a well-established and prominent business in the industry. He said that he has known other executives on the team, such as Matt Cole and Jo Purvis for a very long now and that he was happy to join them at the company as well.</p>
<p>"It feels great to be bringing my expertise to support such a successful commercial team both in the UK and on some really interesting international growth projects. I can’t wait to be working with so many of the world’s biggest and best operators," Wright concluded.</p>
<p>His appointment was welcomed by Matt Cole, who is Managing Director at Blueprint Gaming, who argued that Wright was a well-respected industry veteran. He also said that Wright’s experience in other big brands from the sector would be to the ultimate benefit of Blueprint</p>
<p>Once again, Cole added that Wright will most certainly help with achieving the company’s international and local ambitions. Blueprint Gaming has been working hard in the meantime to ensure that it maintains a steady footprint in various markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company obtained a Swedish B2B license. Blueprint Gaming remains ever-confident in its overall success in all markets that it targets.</p>
