<p>Information about NYX Interactive casinos</p>
<p>NYX Interactive, also known as NYX Gaming Group, is a prominent game provider that operates as the digital division of Scientific Games, otherwise known as SG Digital. The company has a history of providing top-quality online gaming products to some of the biggest operators in the world.</p>
<p>On this page you'll be able to find the best casinos that offer NYX games. These are prearranged with the best ones at the top of the list, but by using a series of filters you can arrange them according to your taste. You'll also see information about NYX's history, the games and software that they offer and how to find bonuses offered by NYX casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>NYX – the digital arm of Scientific Games with a big reputation for quality gaming content</p>
<p>NYX Interactive was formed in Stockholm in 2006 with the aim of delivering gaming titles and software to an international market. It certainly met this aim, implementing a successful strategy and winning the trust of hundreds of customers.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of this success has been forming the NYX Gaming Group with NextGen; a partnership that landed them multiple prestigious EGR awards for its Open Gaming System software – first in 2013, and then in 2016, along with a sports betting award for recently-acquired subsidiary OpenBet.</p>
<p>NYX by this point was one of the leading suppliers in its market with an extensive library of desktop and mobile games, and a workforce of well over 1,000 people across five continents.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was no surprise, then, that interest in the company picked up significantly – to such an extent that the world-famous Scientific Games started to pursue a takeover deal in late 2017. By the turn of the year, a deal worth $630 million had been agreed, and the NYX Gaming Group became the Scientific Games' new interactive division, also known as SGI.</p>
<p>Today, NYX, under the SGI brand, has a bold ambition – to be the world leader in digital gaming, sports betting and iLottery, according to its website. It also backs up its content with a range of certificates, such as the coveted Maltese Gaming Authority license, so players should be confident that it follows the strict regulations set out by the licence.</p>
<p>NYX slots and software</p>
<p>NYX Interactive slots and casino games are released via SG subsidiary companies, such as WMS and NextGen. These games are powered by its award-winning Open Gaming System (OGS) software which is used across the globe. OGS boasts a 'feature-rich roadmap' which means its games are varied and often offer a wide array of extras to players, such as multi-level progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>The company also operates 'omni-channel gaming' where they launch games across various mediums simultaneously: this way customers can access new titles immediately on whichever device they use without seeing a drop in quality. In fact, OGS has its own mobile platform called MOVE, which allows for brisk and smooth gameplay on smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>Games launched in this way include Psycho, a title in NextGen's name; a thrilling slots title based on the famous Alfred Hitchcock movie where players experience superb graphics and a sinister soundtrack as they try and get hold of the lucrative Psycho wilds. You can also see themed games via another SG-affiliate, WMS: Narcos enjoyed huge popularity as a TV show and is a hit with slots players as well, with its lifelike reel symbols and sound-effects based on the series.</p>
<p>There are also some non-themed offerings for players to try out. Raging Rhino Rampage is a fun cartoon-themed WMS title that will have you chasing the horned creatures in a bid to get three fixed jackpot prizes, while NextGen have titles such as Wonder Hounds and Kingdom's Edge for those who like to indulge in a little fiction.</p>
<p>NextGen also have some classic casino games on offer, such as Double Zero Roulette and Blackjack Pro, which, while not as popular as their slots titles, might interest fans of table games.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to see how these games look for yourself, then you'll be able to find them on our lists of free NextGen and WMS slots. It's always a good idea to do this before putting down money as you can learn how the game works and reduce the chances of making errors.</p>
<p>How to find the best NYX online casino</p>
<p>NYX, or SGI, games boast an extremely high level of security thanks to the company's commitment to top industry regulatory certificates, but we need to make sure that the casinos running them meet a similarly high standard. Our team of experts at Casino Guru have created this page for that very purpose: to guide you towards safe NYX casinos.</p>
<p>Our team carries out an in-depth assessment of each casino and then gives it a rating and review according to its performance. Those that pass the test with flying colors can be found by clicking the 'Recommended' tab – we recommend that you start with these.</p>
<p>Some players like to look at the most recently opened sites, and you can see these by selecting the 'Newly opened' tab. To see a complete list of NYX casinos, however, simply select the 'All' tab.</p>
<p>Note: To go further on this topic, our How to choose an online casino article goes into full detail about the other factors to consider. Taking a little time to read this could reap big advantages for you in the future.</p>
<p>How to find NYX online casino bonuses</p>
<p>Many NYX casinos offer bonuses, and these typically come in two forms: deposit bonuses – extra credit or free spins after you make a deposit – or no deposit bonuses, which are like a 'test drive' of a new casino as you get these extras without putting any money in at all.</p>
<p>To find the full list of NYX casino bonuses, go to our list of casino bonuses and choose 'NYX' on the game provider filter. You can see various types of bonuses on this page, so for no deposit bonuses simply click on the 'no deposit bonus' filter. You can see these same options on our list of no deposit bonuses and selecting 'NYX Gaming Group' there to see the same options.</p>
