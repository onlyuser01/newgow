    <h1>Pechanga Resort Casino Pechanga Parkway Temecula Ca Margaritaville Casino Bossier City Atlantic City</h1>

<p>I would like to say here again that I do not expect this casino to pay me my money afterwards, it's sad ðŸ˜¢ but that's not my concern, I want to protect justice and other players from this casino, you lose 95 percent anyway Everyone who plays money should be aware of that, which is also completely fine, otherwise nobody can win big, but that this casino with fraudulent terms and conditions takes away the 5 percent chance of a payout is cheeky! The first time I played it was me already denied the payout because I violated the terms and conditions by playing forbidden games, which is cheeky because these games should be blocked, but they are not because they should serve as a trap so that the casino has a reason to cancel the payout for the player it is playing also it doesn't matter whether you win money with the forbidden game or not! If you take one of the 3 welcome bonuses and then a payout vo If you want to take it, it says whether you are sure and that all existing bonuses will expire and bonus credit will be removed from your account after you have paid out. Now comes the big bang, but you must not leave a cent on your account and play with them are blocked from an active bonus even though you don't have an active bonus! Supposedly, the bonus is only ready when you have paid out all the money from your account that was left after the cancellation of the bonus. That's the next trap, how should you know German is completely different than when you see the English version, most of the time the German translation doesn't make any sense. Please, dear casino guru, help me to take action against this casino. I am also willing to contact the licensor of this casino, I just want it not to happen to many other people. I think that's in the sense of a casino guru, even if it should be written somewhere in English like they tell me who reads terms and conditions in several languages, I have to rely on it that if there is a German translation, it is basically the same as the English one! Best regards, I hope you can understand me and with it also help many other players</p>
