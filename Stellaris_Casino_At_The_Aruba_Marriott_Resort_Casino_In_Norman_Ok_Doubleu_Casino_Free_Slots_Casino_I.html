    <h1>Stellaris Casino At The Aruba Marriott Resort Casino In Norman Ok Doubleu Casino Free Slots Casino I</h1>

<p>The lawsuit, filed on September 25, 2023, in Clark County's eighth judicial district court, claims that the incident occurred because the dealer rolled the roulette marble "in a negligent and unsafe speed/manner"</p>
<p>In an incident at the Gold Coast hotel-casino on October 28, 2021, a local resident, Dalease Brown, found herself in the midst of a casino nightmare. As a result, Brown recently filed a personal injury lawsuit against the Gold Coast casino, operated by Boyd Gaming, alleging that she was severely injured when a roulette ball struck her in the eye due to the dealer’s negligence.</p>
<p>Lawsuit Filed After Roulette Ball Strikes Casino Player</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the rogue marble “ricocheted from the roulette wheel and violently struck Plaintiff in her left eye at a high rate of speed, severely injuring Plaintiff”, reported the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Brown’s attorney, Kevin Hanratty of the Hanratty Law Group, stated that his client suffered instant and excruciating eye pain, leading to permanent damage to her vision. After the incident, security personnel at the casino prepared an incident report, and Brown sought immediate medical treatment at a local hospital.</p>
<p>This case sheds light on the rare but dangerous occurrences involving roulette balls at casinos. Similar incidents have been reported in the past. In 2015, a Washington DC resident sued a casino after being hit in the eye by a roulette ball, while another incident involved a New Orleans resident in 2012. However, the outcomes of these cases varied, highlighting the complexity of legal proceedings in such situations.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming, the operator of Gold Coast casino, has not yet responded to the allegations made by Brown. The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $15,000 for the severe pain, medical expenses, and permanent impairment that Brown has endured as a result of the incident.</p>
<p>From Bats to Roulette Balls: Unusual Casino and Hotel Incidents</p>
<p>Flying roulette balls do not seem that peculiar considering the lawsuit against MGM Resorts caused by a bat. At the end of August, a group of Arizona guests filed a lawsuit against MGM Resorts International, operators of the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, following a harrowing encounter with a live bat in their hotel room.</p>
<p>The incident occurred during their April 2022 stay, prompting concerns about rabies exposure. Marcus Rucker, awakened by a noise, found the bat hanging on their curtains. Despite reporting it to the hotel, the bat was disposed of improperly, preventing rabies testing. Consequently, the Rucker family and two visiting children underwent painful rabies injections. The lawsuit, seeking over $15,000 in damages, alleged emotional distress, suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and disruption to daily life.</p>
