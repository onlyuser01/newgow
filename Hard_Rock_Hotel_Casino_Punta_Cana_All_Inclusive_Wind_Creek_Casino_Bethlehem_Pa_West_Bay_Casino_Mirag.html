    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana All Inclusive Wind Creek Casino Bethlehem Pa West Bay Casino Mirag</h1>

<p>I am being heavily abused by Jungliwin casino so I opened this claim in an attempt to get help for the big theft they are doing to me :(</p>
<p>I am the Jungliwin customer Fern<strong><em> G</em></strong> email: fe***i@hotmail.com</p>
<p>On the 20th of June I registered at this casino, after that I deposited and joined the 1st deposit bonus, played and got a balance of €1463. Then I requested a withdrawal of €1463, a few days later as they hadn't paid me, I questioned them and their answer was that my account had been blocked due to account duplication. I was super annoyed because I don't have duplicate accounts, I asked Jungliwin to give me proof of this duplication but they didn't give me any proof, I offered to send my documentation for the KYC process they didn't want to,.. anyway it's revolting when a bookmaker gives us do this, because we will deserve what they want to do to us :( after much insistence to pay me my balance, they only and today paid the amount of my deposit, that is, of the 1463€ they only paid me 298€! this is revolting because they are to injure me and rob me of 1160€ :(</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do so I open this complaint in an attempt to get help so that this situation ends justly! I never had and still have duplicate accounts at jungliwin and it's strange that this company accuses me of duplicating an account when they didn't even do the KYC process for me :( be only 298€ :(</p>
<p>I am available for whatever is needed, I just want justice, I want to receive my missing €1160! I don't want wars, defamations,..I just want the money that is mine and that jungliwin wants to steal from me! :(</p>
