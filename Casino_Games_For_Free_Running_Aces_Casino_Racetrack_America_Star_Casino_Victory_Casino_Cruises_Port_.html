<p>The leading provider of 24-hour betting services to both global retail and online operators has inked the multi-year extension to the previous rights agreement with the German Tote as a way of expanding its content offering on international markets.</p>
<p>The news comes after Sports Information Services (SIS) announced a similar agreement with Media System Technologies earlier in May for the distribution of the 140th edition of the Italian Gallop Derby to UK and Ireland operators.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, SIS also expanded its reach on the African continent via a newly signed deal with local operator Jolibet.</p>
<p>What Does the Fresh Extension Mean?</p>
<p>SIS will benefit from uninterrupted access to top-tier content from the German Tote, which is recognized as the most successful betting broker for horse racing in Germany.</p>
<p>All German races, including the much-anticipated Deutsches Derby in Hamburg, will become available to all of SIS’ partners spread in all parts of the world via retail and digital channels, delivering different betting opportunities.</p>
<p>The expansion will add to SIS’ current offering which consists of top-quality content from more than 170 tracks and racecourses spread across five different continents, with the US, Europe, Latin America, and Africa included.</p>
<p>SIS expects to use the fresh German racing content to continue to offer the most extensive array of nonstop betting options while helping operators boost their revenue by enjoying a large volume of important events.</p>
<p>At the moment, SIS’ 24-hour Live Betting Channels offer more than 75,000 live racing events yearly provided as end-to-end solutions. The list includes on-screen graphics featuring betting triggers, pictures streamed live, data, and extra markets and prices meant to offer seamless experiences for bettors.</p>
<p>SIS also provides a rich selection of engaging virtual races, horse and greyhound racing, live number draws, and esports while promoting its goal to “maximize value for bookmakers by creating short-form betting events with a betting event every 3 minutes.”</p>
<p>German Tote, Excited About the Agreement</p>
<p>German Tote’s managing director Riko Luiking expressed their excitement regarding the agreement which is expected to help “showcase German racing to a huge international audience.”</p>
<p>Luiking added that the technical service provider for betting shops and marketer for horse racing was looking forward to seeing the partnership go on while offering “excellent, competitive entertainment around the clock.”</p>
<p>Similarly, the head of International Horse Racing Conall McSorley spoke about the strong partnership established with the German Tote while expressing their delight to be able to expand the agreement in the long run.</p>
<p>McSorley also praised their racing portfolio as being “of the highest quality,” adding that their customers should expect to get access to state-of-the-art action that will keep being fueled with the help of the German horse racing market.</p>
<p>In March, SIS announced another important European expansion deal with Go+bet Deal in Poland.</p>
