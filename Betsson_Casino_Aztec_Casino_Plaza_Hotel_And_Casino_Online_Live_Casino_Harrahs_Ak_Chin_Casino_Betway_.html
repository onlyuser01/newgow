<p>Sports betting licensing in Germany is continuing after two more operators received this week’s approvals from the Regional Council of Darmstadt to offer wagering on sports officially, Betway and Betsson.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce that Betway have received a sports betting licence from the Regional Council in Darmstadt.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>8 New Sports Betting Brands</p>
<p>Under the sports betting license, Betsson will operate 7 different brands: Betsson, Betsafe, Casinowinner, Guts, Nordicbet, Rizk Sport, and Schnellwetten, while Betway will offer sports betting via its betway.de website.</p>
<p>“With a growing presence in Germany and successful partnerships with Bundesliga sides SV Werder Bremen, Hertha BSC and VfB Stuttgart, this announcement solidifies the company’s position as one of the leading operators in the market.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>Prior to receiving the sports betting license on March 9, Betway entered into partnerships with Bundesliga football clubs SV Werder Bremen, Hertha BSC, and VfB Stuttgart, seeking to establish a presence in the German sports arena.</p>
<p>“As a leading regulated online betting and gaming company this gives us the transparency and security to cement our position as a responsible gaming provider in the German market.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>25 Operators Approved So Far</p>
<p>Besides the licenses granted to Betsson and Betway, which raised the total number of operators officially approved to offer sports betting in the country to 25, the German sports betting regulatory authority licensed 3 new divisions of Tipico.</p>
<p>“We look forward to delivering on our commitment to our German customers, offering them an unrivalled online sports betting experience in a safe, fair and responsible environment.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>Granting licenses for the new sports betting market in Germany began in October 2020, when 4 operators, GVC, Gauselmann Group, Novomatic, and Tipico, received the first batch of approvals to offer sports wagering under the new regulatory regime.</p>
<p>In November, the regulator from the German province of Hesse issued initially 3 new licenses, to Interwetten, bet-at-home, and Bet3000, and then by the end of the month approved another 3, NetXBetting, Oddset, and Tipster.de.</p>
<p>The sports betting licensing process in Germany under the third amendment of the State Treaty on Gambling was marred with obstacles all the way.</p>
<p>It was significantly delayed in April 2020, after Austrian sportsbook operator Vierklee challenged successfully in court the transparency of the process calling it “discriminatory” and the Administrative Court in Darmstadt halted licensing.</p>
