<p>South Africa’s famous Carousel Casino has reopened under new management and with a new casino management system from International Gaming Technology (IGT).</p>
<p>Carousel Integrates IGT’s Advanced Suite</p>
<p>South Africa’s famous Carousel Casino has reopened under new leadership and with a new casino management system from International Gaming Technology (IGT). The IGT Advantage casino management system (CMS) is a cutting edge suite with a wide range of features to help boost business performance and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The CMS connects around 400 machines on the property. Some of its many functions include machine accounting, patron management, cage and table counting, a table manager. The package also includes the Carded Lucky Coin and the M5 content creation tool. The latter aims to streamline the content creation process and provide patrons with improved interfaces targeted messaging and bonusing.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of IGT’s suite has to be the Resort Wallet. IGT, which is also set to power Maverick’s Colorado casinos, designed it as a single-card cashless module. It enables players to quickly and efficiently move funds between games by simply using their club cards.</p>
<p>The suite is integrated into Carousel’s existing patron management and point-of-sale systems. This gives players quick access to their balance, player club rewards, and a range of property services. The aim is to reduce operational costs, increase club membership, and boost carded play.</p>
<p>New Management, New Systems</p>
<p>The Carousel Casino reopened its doors recently after shutting down earlier this year. The casino relaunched under new management – Lakama Group. It is also the very first casino in South Africa to be equipped with IGT’s innovative Resort Wallet.</p>
<p>IGT Vice President of Sales and Operations in the EMEA Mark MacCombie said that the Carousel Casino’s decision to integrate IGT’s management suite was indicative of the system’s power and reliability. He noted that the CMS was a proven solution to maximize floor performance, simplify operations, and increase player loyalty.</p>
<p>Lakama Resorts and Casino Chairman of the Board of Directors Mario Morfou lauded IGT’s system. According to Mr. Morfou, the IGT Advantage CMS was stable and with a user-friendly configuration. He also praised its ability to automate more of the business, which frees up the casino staff and allows for an improved gaming experience for patrons.</p>
<p>Back From the Brink</p>
<p>The Carousel Casino is one of South Africa’s oldest and most well-known casinos. The massive complex first opened its doors in 1991. Its operations were put into absolute disarray earlier this year by the anti-pandemic measures set by the South African Government.</p>
<p>The casino’s previous leadership, Sun International, decided to permanently close the site. Earlier this month, Sun International announced that the casino complex was successfully sold and that it would reopen under new management.</p>
<p>The Carousel Casino reopened only very recently – on 15 December – after being purchased by Lakama Group.</p>
