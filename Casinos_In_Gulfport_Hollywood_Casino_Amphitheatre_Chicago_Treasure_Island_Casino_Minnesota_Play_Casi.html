    <h1>Casinos In Gulfport Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Chicago Treasure Island Casino Minnesota Play Casi</h1>

<p>Hello Stamos.</p>
<p>In your case depends on how you reached your balance/profits.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>If you played on slots which had some malfunction and for example, the chance for winning was significantly higher than it should be. Then this problem was caused by technical error and casino should cancel all the bets and put your account balance to the state where it was before you started to play on malfunctioned slots.</p>
<p>But if you reached your balance €44000 on the game which was working correctly and only then moved to the game which was malfunctioned, then your balance should be set to €44000.</p>
<p>And I am damn sure that casino now trying desperately to find that point. Because the games disappeared from the casino, it probably means that something is wrong with them. Unfortunately, here game provider must do a complete investigation, and it will take a while.</p>
<p>We can start a dialogue with the casino and at least get some info about the time-frame of the investigation, but we can't help you more at this point.</p>
