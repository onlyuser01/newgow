<p>The betting of Vietnamese lottery in each region has different ways of playing and winning leverage. This depends on the rules of the Vietnamese lottery betting in different areas including the North, the Central Coast, and the South. This article demonstrates the details of all the ways to play the lottery of the three regions of Vietnam - North - Central - South.</p>
<p>A. LOTTERY BETTING IN THE NORTH</p>
<ol>
<li>LOT BETTING</li>
</ol>
<p>It means that you will bet on the occurrence of a specific number in the result of the daily Vietnamese lottery draw. There are two common types in lot betting, two-digit package, and three-digit package.</p>
<p>8 lottery prizes with 27 winning chances</p>
<p>Two-digit package</p>
<p>In a two-digit package, you would buy a bet ticket that predicts the last two digits of the eight lottery prizes (27 winning chances) from the daily Vietnamese Lottery Draw with leverage of one win 80 for a single win. If your number appears in that last 2 digits of one or multiple prizes, you would win. If your number appears N times in the draw, you win N x 80 x "bet amount". For example, you bet 1,000 CHIP on the number "25", when compared with the Vietnamese lottery result, if the number "25" appears twice in the lottery draw, you would win the following: 2 x 80 x 1,000 = 160,000 CHIPs.</p>
<p>The number "25" appears twice in the result</p>
<p>Three-digit package</p>
<p>Similarly, in a three-digit package (with leverage of one win 500), you will bet for the occurrence of a number with 3 digits, for example, "470". If the number "470" appears N times in the draw, you would win the following: N x 500 x "bet amount". However, since you are betting for a number with 3 digits, you only have 23 positions left.</p>
<p>23 winning chances left for three-digit package</p>
<p>With the above result, if you bet 1,000 CHIPs for the number "470", you will win the following amount of 1 x 500 x 1,000 = 500,000 CHIPs.</p>
<p>The number "470" appears in the last three digits in one of the two 2nd prizes</p>
<ol>
<li>PARLAY BETTING</li>
</ol>
<p>Parlay betting means that you will bet for the occurrences of multiple numbers in the lottery result. In order to win, all of your chosen numbers have to appear in the Vietnamese lottery draw of that day. For this type of lottery betting, you will have 4 types – Parlay 2, Parlay 3, and Parlay 4.</p>
<p>Regarding the rule of Parlay-2, you buy a bet ticket that predicts two numbers (each number has two digits) in the eight lottery prizes (27 winning chances) from the daily Vietnamese Lottery Draw with leverage of one win 14 for a single win. If your two numbers incidentally appear in that last 2 digits of two or multiple prizes, you would win. For example, you bet 1,000 CHIP on the pair "36" and "37", when compared with the Vietnamese lottery result, if both of them appear in the last two digits of the prizes in that day’s lottery draw, you would win 14,000 CHIPs. Either one of them does not appear, you will lose your bet.</p>
<p>To win in Parlay-2, both chosen numbers have to be in the result</p>
<p>Similarly, in Parlay-3 (one win 53), you bet for the occurrences of 3 numbers (each one has 2 digits). For example, if you bet 1,000 CHIPs for the three numbers "00", "01", "10", you would win the following 1,000 x 53 = 53,000 CHIPs based on the result. Either one of them does not appear, you will lose your bet.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Parlay-4 (one win 200), you bet for the occurrences of 4 numbers (each one has 2 digits). For example, if you bet 1,000 CHIPs for the three numbers "00", "01", "10", "81" you would win the following 1,000 x 200 = 200,000 CHIPs based on the result. Either one of them does not appear, you will lose your bet.</p>
<ol>
<li>HEAD AND TALE</li>
</ol>
<p>Head</p>
<p>You buy a ticket to predict the second last digit of the Special prize (the Head). If the second last digit of this prize is identical to your chosen number, you would win with leverage of one win 5. For example, you bet 1,000 CHIPs that the second last digit of the Special prize is "5". If that number appears in the second last digit of the Special Prize, for instance, the Special prize of that day is "90157", you would win 1,000 x 5 = 5,000 CHIPs because the number "5" is the second last digit of the Special Prize.</p>
<p>Tale</p>
<p>You buy a ticket to predict the last digit of the special prize (the Tail). If the last digit of this prize is identical to your chosen number, you would win with leverage of one win 5. For example, you bet 1,000 CHIPs that the last digit of the Special Prize is "7". If that number appears in the last digit of the Special Prize, for instance, the Special prize of that day is "90157", you would win 1,000 x 5 = 5,000 CHIPs because the number "7" is the last digit of the Special Prize.</p>
<ol>
<li>MISSING LOT BETTING</li>
</ol>
<p>The missing lot itself is the lot that does not appear in the daily lottery result. This betting includes Missing-4, Missing-8, and Missing-10.</p>
<p>For the Missing-4 lot betting, you bet for 4 numbers that will not appear in the lottery draw of that day. The leverage is one win 2. For example, you bet 1,000 CHIPs that the 4 numbers "22", "33, "44", and "55" will not appear at the last 2 digits of any lottery prize of that day. If these numbers do not show up as the result, you will win 1,000 x 2=2,000 CHIPs.</p>
<p>Similarly, the. This means that you bet for 8 numbers that will not appear in the lottery draw of that day. The leverage is one win 5. For example, you bet 1,000 CHIPs that the 8 numbers "22", "33, "44", "55", "20", "30", "40", "50" will not appear at the last 2 digits of any lottery prize of that day. If these numbers do not show up as the result, you will win 1,000 x 5=5,000 CHIPs.</p>
<ol>
<li>HEAD-SPECIAL BETTING</li>
</ol>
<p>Head</p>
<p>You buy a ticket to predict the last two digits of the 7th prizes (the Head). If the last two digits of these prizes are identical to your chosen number, you would win with leverage of one win 75. If your chosen number appears N times, you would win 75 x 1000 x N CHIPs. For example, you bet 1000 CHIPs that the last two digits of the 7th prizes are "72". If that number appears twice in the last two digits of the 7th prizes, you would win 1,000 x 75 x 2 = 150,000 CHIPs.</p>
<p>Special</p>
<p>You buy a ticket to predict the last two digits of the Special prize (the Special). If the last two digits of this prize are identical to your chosen number, you would win with leverage of one win 75. For example, you bet 1000 CHIPs that the last two digits of the Special prize are "57". If that number appears in the last two digits of the Special prize, you would win 1,000 x 75 = 75,000 CHIPs.</p>
<ol>
<li>TRIPPLE SPECIAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Buy a bet ticket that predicts the last three digits of the Special prize from the daily Vietnamese Lottery Draw with leverage of one win 500 for a single win. If your number appears in that last 3 digits of the Special Prize, you would win. If your number appears N times in the draw, you win N x 500 x "bet". For example, you bet 1,000 CHIP on the number "157" for Triple Special, when compared with the Vietnamese lottery result, if the last three digits the Special Prize are "157", you would win the following: 1,000 x 500 = 500,000 CHIPs.</p>
<p>B. LOTTERY BETTING IN THE SOUTH AND THE CENTRAL</p>
<p>Similar to the lot betting in the North, you will bet on the occurrence of a specific number in the result of the daily Vietnamese lottery draw. There are two common types in lot betting, two-digit package, and three-digit package. However, in the Southern regions, there are 9 lottery prizes but only 18 winning chances. Hence, although the rules of playing/ betting are similar to the North region, the winning rates are quite different.</p>
<p>The winning rate lot betting and Triple Special for the South and the Central is as followed:</p>
<p>• Two-digit package: one win 75.</p>
<p>• Three-digit package: one win 600.</p>
