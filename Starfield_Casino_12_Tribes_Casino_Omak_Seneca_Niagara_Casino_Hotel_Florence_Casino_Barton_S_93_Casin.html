<p>Stakelogic, a leading casino content house, has inked a new agreement that will expand its presence in Northern Europe. Under a Netherlands-oriented deal with bet365, the provider will reinforce its Dutch footprint.</p>
<p>Stakelogic to Power bet365 with Content</p>
<p>Per the agreement, Stakelogic will power the famous operator’s Netherlands content offering with its full suite of critically-acclaimed slot games. The agreement is expected to greatly boost bet365’s popularity in the country considering how beloved Stakelogic’s products are among locals. The provider launched in the Netherlands a year ago and has already cemented itself as one of the preferred slot companies.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, bet365 will be able to distinguish itself from its competitors and become one of the preferred operators of Dutch players. To that end, the company will excite its users with some of Stakelogic’s best games, including chart-topping titles such as Classic Joker 5 Reels and Hot Joker. In addition, the operator will offer other proven Stakelogic hits, including titles like Candyways Bonanza Megaways 2 and Bandits Thunder Link.</p>
<p>All of Stakelogic’s games are designed with the player in mind and, as a result, offer premium experiences that suit the need of contemporary bettors. The company is proud of delivering thrilling content that players love to return to.</p>
<p>The Content House Is Excited to Join Forces with the Operator</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s chief commercial officer, Olga Bajela, commented on the newly-minted agreement with bet365. She said that a deal with one of the biggest gambling operators in the world attests to the quality of Stakelogic’s proprietary slot games. Bajela added that Stakelogic’s games have taken the Netherlands by storm and are now a “must-have” for any operator that wishes to target the local market. The CCO noted that local audiences have been particularly fond of classic slots.</p>
<p>Bajela thanked bet365 for trusting Stakelogic, saying that the agreement means a lot to her company and the local gamblers.</p>
<p>Our classic slots in particular have been a big hit with players in the Dutch market and we are thrilled to be helping bet365 grow its classic portfolio with our games. This is a great deal for us, for bet365 and most importantly for its players. Olga Bajela, CCO, Stakelogic</p>
<p>In other news, a week ago, Stakelogic launched its content portfolio with Videoslots in Italy. The agreement with the local operator further helped the provider cement its position as a leading supplier in Europe.</p>
<p>In October, Stakelogic Live, the provider’s live casino subsidiary, struck a deal with LeoVegas, agreeing to provide its content offering with live dealer content.</p>
