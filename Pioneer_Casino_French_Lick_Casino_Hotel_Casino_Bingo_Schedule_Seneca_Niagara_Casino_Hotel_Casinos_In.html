<p>Intelitics, a company that focuses on performance marketing and provides partners with data-driven solutions, will help Prophet Exchange, a new betting operator in the United States, as the company seeks to establish its market footprint and grow its presence in the country.</p>
<p>Intelitics to Leverage Data and help Prophet Exchange</p>
<p>Prophet Exchange recently rolled out in the market in New Jersey and is going to focus on further expansion in regulated betting markets. The company relies on a cutting-edge platform that it hopes will help it gain ground and appeal to consumers through its peer-to-peer betting model.</p>
<p>Intelitics’ own product offer will help the company with tracking affiliate and paid media activity and provide real-time monitoring and player statistics. The resulting information is fed to Prophet who can use it to further optimize its own offer.</p>
<p>The data is also used to create advertisement campaigns and integrate them with Facebook and other tier-one ad networks, the company explained in a press release. Intelitics VP of sales and growth Allan Petrilli welcomed the opportunity and said that the company was determined to support Prophet Exchange in its customer acquisition efforts. Petrilli said:</p>
<p>Their vision for bringing an innovative new betting opportunity in the peer-to-peer exchange space in the US market is exciting, and they have built an incredible team to execute it. Intelitics VP of sales and growth Allan Petrilli</p>
<p>Petrilli explained that the company’s platform has been designed in a way that will allow Prophet to quickly scale up its acquisition efforts. Thomas Philips, VP of marketing for Prophet Exchange, also welcomed the partnership opportunity and said that Intelitics has a best-in-class product offering.</p>
<p>Philips assured that Prophet Exchange is committed to driving its growth and player-acquisition efforts in New Jersey and beyond and welcomed the opportunity to do so with Intelitics by its side.</p>
<p>Customer Acquisition Efforts Remain Key for the Company</p>
<p>Prophet Exchange has developed a highly innovative product that focuses on peer-to-peer sports betting exchange. The idea of this product is to let participants set the prices for others to bet on. This way, Prophet says, sports fans get to benefit from the best possible odds and fixtures.</p>
<p>The company has considerably strengthened its proposition over the past months. Before going live in New Jersey, the company hired a trio of executives to help it with its market entry. The exchange launched less than a month ago on August 29 and has been enjoying fairly good success. The addition of Intelitics will only contribute to this.</p>
