<p>The Ocean Sportsbook is now available on Princess Cruises’ fleet of MedallionClass ships, becoming one of the first cruise companies to offer sports betting on the high seven.</p>
<p>Princess Cruises Embraces Sports Betting Innovation</p>
<p>The Princess Cruises has revealed its Ocean Sportsbook, a new real-time sports wagering betting platform that is now available on the MedallionClass ships and that will cruise the seven seas offering an advanced betting solution.</p>
<p>The company is taking the riverboat concept and scaling it up, to provide travelers who have a soft spot for sports betting with a variety of betting markets, including basketball, baseball, hockey, and various college sports, picking from domestic and international markets.</p>
<p>The Ocean Sportsbook is compliant with national regulation and its service may be limited or suspended depending on where any of the ships hosting it drop their anchor. Bets will be allowed before pre-game and in real time, thanks to a dedicated app.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz had this to add: “On Princess MedallionClass cruises our guests can stay connected with their friends and family around the world, and now with Ocean Sportsbook, they can also stay connected to their favorite teams and wager on a host of events whenever they sail with us.”</p>
<p>Going on a cruise would no longer mean that travelers must be disconnected, Swartz reassured, as the company has been exploring opportunities to bring a new form of entertainment onboard. With sports betting in the United States already hitting $20 billion over the past two years, the market is projected to reach $155 billion by 2024, according to ESPN and a market survey conducted back in 2019.</p>
<p>Regulated Sports Betting on the High Seas</p>
<p>If this number is true, it exceeds the $150 billion supposedly wagered offshore. The company has worked with experienced software developers to bring the Miomni Ocean Sportsbook across Princess Cruises’ fleet of MedallionClass ships starting in 2021.</p>
<p>Princess has already invested in the Ocean Casino, an iGaming and in-person experience on board of its ship granting access to roulette, bingo, keno, slots, poker, blackjack, lottery and more.</p>
<p>The company has been looking to further enhance the experience by introducing the OceanMedallion wearables which allow guests to stay connected with everything that happens onboard the ship.</p>
<p>Ocean Sportsbook is a part of that direction to improve the guest experience. “Wagering is now seamlessly fused into the overall guest experience in both digital and physical interactions all powered by the OCEAN Guest Experience Platform,” added Carnival Corporation chief experience and innovation officer, John Padgett.</p>
<p>The Ocean Sportsbook will not run any fixtures on Miami Heat, because of an affiliation between Carnival Corporation and Miami Heat.</p>
