<p>Premier global online gaming operator PointsBet continues to add talent to its ranks as a display of its resolve to establish a presence in the Canadian sports betting and online gaming space.</p>
<p>PointsBet Has High Hopes</p>
<p>Australian-based online gaming brand PointsBet announced the addition of Canadian digital media leader Dale Fallon as the company’s Senior Director of Product in Canada.</p>
<p>As we continue to establish the PointsBet Canada brand, we will remain true to the PointsBet mandate of arming the team with best-in-class talent to ultimately realize best-in-class execution.” Nic Sulsky, CCO, PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>Having known Dale Fallon for over ten years and having admired his work for even longer, PointsBet Canada CCO Nic Sulsky was happy to finally call him a teammate, underlying the high hopes the company is placing in its new senior director of product and its other recent hires to “ensure our product represents, understands, and appropriately connects with the Canadian sports landscape and its passionate, unique fanbase.”</p>
<p>Sulsky was part of the recent talent shopping spree that saw key hires at PointsBet Canada, including Scott Vanderwel as chief executive officer and Chantal Cipriano as Vice President, Legal, Compliance &amp; People.</p>
<p>Fallon brings extensive industry experience to PointsBet Canada, having led Digital Products at Rogers Sportsnet, Canada’s No. 1 sports media brand, where he was responsible for the development of NHL content-focused product strategy and its delivery via a suite of digital assets, including apps and websites.</p>
<p>Opportunity to Capitalize</p>
<p>Speaking about his appointment, PointsBet Canada senior director of product Fallon outlined the opportunity the operator has to “capitalize on one of the most exciting new gaming markets in the world” due to its “strong in-house technology and innovative business model.”</p>
<p>PointsBet possesses the competitive advantage of controlling their own roadmap, and as we build our distinctly Canadian operation, I look forward to using that advantage to assist in the creation of a brand and product that strongly resonates with consumers in this country.” Dale Fallon, Senior Director of Product, PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>Holder of a BA from UBC in Vancouver, Fallon also spearheaded product management at theScore, where he was charged with oversight of the early launch and growth of ScoreMobile across several mobile platforms. In 2016, at Sportsnet NOW, the first mainstream sports broadcaster to go over-the-top (OTT) in North America, Fallon led the product launch of the comprehensive video streaming service.</p>
<p>Fallon is an avid sports fan of teams in his hometown of Toronto, the Maple Leafs of the NHL, MLB’s Blue Jays, NBA’s Raptors and MLS’ Reds. He’s also a supporter of Arsenal FC of the English Premier League Arsenal FC and is a regular contributor for Ryerson University sports innovation and research initiative with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment “Future of Sport Lab.”</p>
