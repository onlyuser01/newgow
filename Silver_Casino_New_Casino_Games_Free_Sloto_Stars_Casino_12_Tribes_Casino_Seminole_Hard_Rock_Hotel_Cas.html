<p>Rootz Limited has teamed up with Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GIG) for the latter’s proprietary compliance technology, GiG Comply.</p>
<p>GiG Comply to Empower Rootz’s Regulatory Compliance</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group Inc. (GIG) has entered in a partnership with Rootz Limited to enhance the back-end solutions provider’s compliance across different markets. Rootz will benefit from the iGaming technology developer’s compliance tool, GiG Comply, and thus ensure that the highest marketing standards are upheld.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Rootz will be able to leverage GiG’s proprietary solution to tailor its product and offering to local legislative and advertising standards and satisfy responsible gambling requirements.</p>
<p>GiG has tailored a tool that is capable of scanning through thousands of websites, including affiliates, and across a numerous-language database and find potential red flags that could be bad for business.</p>
<p>The company’s algorithm is capable of sorting through ambiguous and misleading words and links, analyzing those against a backdrop of regulatory norms across numerous jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A Perfect Fit to Ensure Regulatory Compliance</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, GiG Media Managing Director Jonas Warrer said that the company was happy to be teaming up with Rootz and was looking forward to help the operator optimize its compliance strategy regardless of the market.</p>
<p>“GiG Comply will help to ensure that Rootz remains proactive and stay in control of all of their affiliate marketing, safeguarding their license,” said Warrer.</p>
<p>Rootz Limited Chief Legal &amp; Compliance Officer Matti Metsola confirmed that the company is equally excited to add GiG Comply’s tool to its offer. Automation, Metsola noted, is a primary focus for Rootz.</p>
<p>GiG is a perfect match for everything that Rootz is trying to achieve and stand for, he added. “In an ever-evolving regulatory environment, we look forward to GiG Comply’s ability to flag vulnerable content quickly,” Metsola concluded.</p>
<p>Rootz operates Wildz Casino and delivers a preeminent online gaming management platform to empower partners.</p>
<p>GiG Comply recently teamed up with LeoVegas to help the brand streamline its affiliate marketing strategy, leveraging GiG’s unique algorithm that makes it possible to scan 30,000 web pages per day. Earlier this year, GiG tied up another successful partnership with PokerStars, to help the leading online card room with compliance.</p>
