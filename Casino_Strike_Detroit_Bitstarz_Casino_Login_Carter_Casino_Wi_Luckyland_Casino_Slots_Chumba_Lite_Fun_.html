<p>Launched in 2008, ComeOn Group is one of the leading operators in the fast-expanding iGaming market determined to constantly provide its customers with safe, corruption-free betting experiences on its platforms. The group has announced a new multi-year membership agreement with the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), the leading international voice on integrity for regulated betting markets.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group Joins a Prestigious List of IBIA Members</p>
<p>IBIA reports suspicious betting activities to industry regulators and government agencies. By becoming a member of the association, ComeOn Group will join a prestigious list of operators leading regulated markets for sports betting worldwide. The list includes names like bet365, Betano, 888 Sport, Betsson, Betsafe, Coral, Flutter, Entain, Unibet, and many more.</p>
<p>In total, IBIA members account for more than $137 billion of the worldwide betting turnover per year, and they also represent close to half of all regulated betting activities completed by online operators. All IBIA members share the same goal of fighting off corruption in the betting world while protecting the integrity of the sports industry and their businesses.</p>
<p>According to its new member status, ComeOn Group will allow IBIA to monitor all of its betting brands and issue alerts whenever a suspicious betting behavior or match-fixing pattern is identified on any of its platforms. With the help of complex reporting and monitoring solutions, IBIA will add more protection to ComeOn Group’s database of players.</p>
<p>The New Membership, a Natural Step for ComeOn Group</p>
<p>It will do this by collecting important information and acknowledging various types of corrupted behaviors related to sports betting activities online. IBIA’s Monitoring &amp; Alert Platform is an excellent bespoke tool used in the fight against corruption that can detect and report suspicious activities on a variety of betting markets.</p>
<p>The tool carefully tracks down all transactions connected to the accounts of individual bettors and relies on numerous partnerships with the Union of European Football Association, Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or the International Tennis Integrity Agency. These partnerships allow IBIA to get access to critical information that can be used to fight off corruption.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group considers the new agreement a natural step in its continuous endeavor to provide responsible betting options for well-guarded experiences. Besides its licensing and regulatory requirements, ComeOn is also busy addressing corruption problems in sports betting. With the help of its partners, IBIA will successfully investigate, prosecute, and sanction all parties involved in match-fixing events connected to ComeOn Group’s markets.</p>
<p>IBIA is also engaged in important domestic and global talks regarding the enhancement of policies protecting legal operators, as well as consumers and the sports industry in general. ComeOn’s chief officer Juergen Reutter called IBIA “the most prestigious integrity body globally”, while referring to their decision to join them as “a badge of honor” for the group. IBIA’s chief executive officer Khalid Ali considers the new membership agreement “another important step for the association” on its path toward global expansion.</p>
<p>At the beginning of February, ComeOn Group announced Evolution would be deploying its dedicated Ruby Lounge studio production floor to cater to the group’s live dealer needs, amid growing demand for iGaming products. In March, IBIA announced it would expand its partnership with H2 Gambling Capital.</p>
