<p>Recently retired professional soccer player with iconic titles under his belt and impressive career highlights Sergio Aguero has sealed a multi-year deal with prestigious sportsbook and crypto casino Stake.com.</p>
<p>Aguero’s Pick Came Naturally for Stake.com</p>
<p>Last December, Sergio Aguero was forced to put his soccer boots on the shelf a lot sooner than his fans would have wanted him to do it. A heart problem put an early end date on the career of the 33-year-old who scooped up five English Premier League titles, an Olympic Gold Medal, the Europa League title, and a Copa America. Aguero’s iconic skills helped him score more than 300 top-tier goals in his career, turning him into one of the most iconic players of his generation.</p>
<p>The impressive achievements of the former striker for Argentina and Manchester City have also propelled him on the elite list of brand ambassadors for Stake.com. According to an official statement by Stake.com, Aguero perfectly matches their premium play style and will further help them move forward on their journey to achieving greatness. Last summer, Stake signed another important multi-year front-shirt sponsor contract with Watford, a popular Premier League club. In January this year, Stake also became the official shirt sleeve partner for Swindon Town FC.</p>
<p>After his retirement, the ex-soccer player started spending a lot of time on the popular Twitch platform for streaming live content, while managing KRÜ, an esports company he has personally created. The ex-striker is expected to bring his undying passion for playing soccer at a professional level, as well as his interest in esports and live streaming on Twitch to the top sportsbook and cryptocurrency casino.</p>
<p>Stake.com and Aguero Share Similar Ambitions</p>
<p>It is not only Stake that has expressed delight and excitement to be working with the iconic soccer star. Sergio Aguero has also stated that he is thrilled to be joining the team, especially since he has closely watched their evolution and their closer bonding with soccer. Aguero also considers that Stake’s ambitions perfectly blend in with his own desires and goals as part of the new phase of his life.</p>
<p>As one of the fastest developing crypto-based gaming and betting operators on the planet, Stake.com will be globally represented by Aguero during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 as well as beyond it. This way, Aguero, who has spent over a decade wearing Man. City’s shirts with great pride will be joining the operator’s premium roster of top athletes and sportscast clubs from all parts of the world. The list includes names like Francis Ngannou and Israel Adesanya, two UFC legends.</p>
<p>As part of the new partnership, Aguero will be involved in a number of initiatives such as creating exclusive promotions, content, or VIP guest bundles together with Stake. The operator anticipates that Aguero’s legacy will speak for itself while helping them expand their presence at a worldwide level in the context of celebrating the World Cup alongside one of the iconic players of the game.</p>
