<p>The money provided by these grants will help five non-profit organizations introduce programs that prevent gambling harm</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling has announced the recipients of its Spring Agility Grants. As noted by the company, it will provide $193,000 in funding to five gambling harm relief organizations.</p>
<p>Agility Grants is a strategic initiative that seeks to back nonprofits, providing them with much-needed funding to prevent problem gambling. The grants help organizations provide services in areas where there are none and reach more people struggling with harm.</p>
<p>The initiative will see the NCPG provide charities with more than $1 million over 3 years, bolstering sager gambling efforts across the United States. The program is backed by major names such as the NFL Foundation and FanDuel which seek to spread awareness of the dangers of irresponsible betting.</p>
<p>This year, the program received a record-breaking number of applications, leading to what the NCPG called a “highly competitive selection progress.” Finally, the council decided to award grants to the following organizations:</p>
<p>Hispanic Urban Minority Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Outreach Program</p>
<p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness – Maryland Chapter</p>
<p>The Nevada Council on Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Nicasa Behavioral Health Services</p>
<p>Student Assistance Services of Tarrytown, NY</p>
<p>Each of these will use the funding to support a new or existing initiative, adding to the effort in the war on gambling harm.</p>
<p>It Is Critical to Tackle Harm Early On</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, NCPG’s executive director, commented on the importance of prevention, saying that it is not only cheaper but also more effective and sensible. He noted that this spring’s grants will fund programs that provide innovative models designed to reach priority groups. He said that his team is proud to be able to support these initiatives and hopes that they will encourage and inspire future efforts.</p>
<p>Clare Graff, NFL’s VP of social responsibility, also commented on the grounds, lauding the NCPG’s hard and innovative work. She said that the NFL is glad to sponsor these grants and help the council curb the problem gambling rates in the country.</p>
<p>The funding for these Agility Grants through the NFL Foundation will provide critical resources to nonprofit organizations across the country who are on the front lines of problem gambling prevention. Clare Graff, VP of social responsibility, NFL</p>
<p>Grants are awarded twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall. The Fall 2023 funding round will accept applicants from July 11 to August 22.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the NCPG welcomed several new members, strengthening its advisory board.</p>
