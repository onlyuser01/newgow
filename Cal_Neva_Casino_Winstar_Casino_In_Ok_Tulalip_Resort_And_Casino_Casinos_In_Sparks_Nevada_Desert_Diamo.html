<p>Global gaming operator Betway has inked six new sponsorship agreements with teams across the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
<p>Betway Strengthens its Brand in the USA</p>
<p>Online betting and gaming brand Betway has announced six new partnerships with franchises across the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). The deals will significantly increase Betway’s presence in the USA.</p>
<p>Betway will collaborate with the most prominent basketball league in the world through its partnerships with Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, LA Clippers, and Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>The New York Islanders will be Betway’s partner in the NHL. Moreover, the Los Angeles Kings will feature the brand via in-game and other digital assets.</p>
<p>Betway chief executive Anthony Werkman said that the partnerships demonstrate the company’s commitment to promoting the Betway brand across high-profile sports shown around the world. He added:</p>
<p>“Our branding will be seen courtside and rinkside in some of the biggest arenas in North America, bringing our customers closer to the action. Our brand is recognised globally as a leader in offering a fair, safe and responsible environment in which to place wagers and we look forward to US customers enjoying a similar experience.”</p>
<p>Werkman highlighted the brand’s global recognition as a leader in terms of a fair, safe and responsible gambling environment and expressed his confidence that US customers will soon enjoy a similar experience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Betway has returned to the tennis field at the Miami Open tournament. The company’s branding can be seen both courtside and digitally during the two-week event, which is currently taking place at Hard Rock Stadium by April 4.</p>
<p>The deal was made possible after The ATP Tour lifted its two-year ban on men’s tennis tournaments agreeing sponsorship deals with sports betting and daily fantasy operators. The moratorium was introduced in 2018 following a number of match-fixing scandals.</p>
<p>Betway Enters German Sports-Betting Market</p>
<p>In the beginning of March, the UK-based sports betting operator received the green light to enter the German market. The Regional Council in Darmstadt approved Betway’s license giving the bookmaker the possibility to offer online betting products to players across Germany.</p>
<p>Betway has already signed its first partnerships to enter the German sports field. The agreements include Bundesliga football clubs SV Werder Bremen, Hertha BSC, and VfB Stuttgart.</p>
<p>In the first months of 2020, Betway also achieved progress in other markets across the world. The operator announced a sponsorship deal for the T20 cricket tournament in South Africa. Additionally, it revealed the launch of ‘Betway Squad’ to expand its exposure on Brazilian territory.</p>
