<p>Codere Online, which went public on NASDAQ two years ago, reported net gaming revenue (NGR) of $46.97 million for the third quarter. This marks a 41% year-on-year increase for the company.</p>
<p>The growth was mostly attributable to improvements in Mexico and Codere’s home country of Spain. Mexico saw a 63% improvement, achieving $22.56 million, and Spain’s NGR increased by 27% to $20.17 million.</p>
<p>Codere Online’s gaming revenue was responsible for 58% of the total third-quarter revenue and was 5% better than last year. Sports betting added 42% to the total.</p>
<p>In Colombia, where Codere Online has a smaller presence, its gaming operations only delivered $1.6 million, a year-on-year decline of 5%.</p>
<p>The company didn’t provide specific figures for Argentina or Panama. They were included in the category of “other,” which was worth $977K in NGR.</p>
<p>Smarter Spending</p>
<p>Coinciding with the increased NGR in its two biggest markets was an increase in the operator’s number of players. Mexico reported 39% more average monthly players than the previous month, while Spain received a 16% boost.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) closed at a breakeven point, neither negative nor positive. However, it improved over the -$13.67 million adjusted EBITDA a year ago.</p>
<p>This was made possible by controlled spending, including in Codere Online’s marketing. The company spent $21.04 million on marketing in the quarter, whereas it had spent $25.96 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Reaching Goals</p>
<p>The across-the-board improvements left Codere executives more optimistic about the future. They believe that the NGR for the year could reach $179.4 million, compared to the $174.4 million the company previously forecast.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA could be around -$10.9 million. In its last update, Codere Online said it could be as low as -$16.35 million. It lost $25.42 million in 2021 and $54.7 million in 2022. Achieving its adjusted EBITDA goal means it will have recovered by 70% compared to last year.</p>
<p>Through September, Codere Online has reported a total NGR of $130.05 million, a 43% year-on-year improvement. Adjusted EBITDA is -$8.13 million, a significant 79.2% jump.</p>
<p>As a result, and provided there are no surprises, Codere Online expects to “generate positive Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow for the full year in 2024,” according to CFO Oscar Iglesias.</p>
