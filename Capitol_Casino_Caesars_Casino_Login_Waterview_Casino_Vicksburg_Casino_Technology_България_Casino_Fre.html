<p>Black Gold 2 Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a frontier oil field.</p>
<p>In the shadow of a rocking pumpjack, players will amble through a gritty encampment. Grabbing a lantern and a few sticks of dynamite, they’ll see if they can strike it rich.</p>
<p>This game has plenty of Wild West vibes with a slick oil rush twist. Players will be transported to a dusty place where wealth lies underfoot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a cinematic tune filled with rattling chains and bells. The music brings to mind the part of a Western movie when the hero faces down the villain for better or worse.</p>
<p>The animation is rendered in impressive detail, with ornate pipes framing the reels and puffs of smoke escaping them. The aesthetic is diesel punk with some cowboy flourish.</p>
<p>A gorgeous sunset silhouettes rugged machinery and the rhythmic movement of the pumpjack as it draws oil from the ground. The camp seems to have a bittersweet story that goes with it, and it’s easy to imagine a narrative.</p>
<p>The symbols include a sly looking oil executive and a donkey gobbling up money as if it's grass. They add a jaded mood to the world and make it clear that cash is king in this place.</p>
<p>Overall, the high quality animation and sense of story add a lot to the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Black Gold is a six reel slot with a 4-5-5-5-5-4 row format.</p>
<p>This game uses an Any Ways Wins system, which means that wins are awarded for matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>The gamble feature allows players to wager their current win by drawing a card from an infinite deck and betting on red or black.</p>
<p>This game also has a Super Stake option, which allows players to double their bet to activate extra bonuses. The doubled bet does not change the paytable, but rather the additional bet is used to support the Super Stake feature that returns equivalent RTP as the base game.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When players land 4 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins Feature is triggered. Landing additional Scatter symbols gives players more free spins.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, a win multiplier is activated. Players are assigned at random the free spins and multiplier that they play with. A higher number of free spins will be accompanied by lower multipliers, and vice versa. However, multipliers will increase after cascades.</p>
<p>The Gold Rush feature is triggered when 4 Bonus symbols land. Players begin the feature with 3 respins, and the number of respins will be reset when any Bonus symbols land.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol multipliers will continue to accumulate throughout the Gold Rush feature. While in this feature, players may land Special Bonus features on the eighth reel. These features may add multipliers, expand symbols, or increase the likelihood of Bonus symbols landing.</p>
<p>At the top of the base game, players will find a Bonus reel where five additional Bonus symbols can be found. These include Stacked Wilds, Free Spins, Multiplier Wilds and more.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.01%, almost exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility oil field-themed slot.</p>
<p>The detailed animation and well-imagined setting make this slot aesthetically pleasing. The highlight is the plethora of bonus opportunities that keep gameplay fun and varied.</p>
<p>Players will love the experience of this world while the high volatility makes it a savvy choice for maximising the chance to hit big wins.</p>
