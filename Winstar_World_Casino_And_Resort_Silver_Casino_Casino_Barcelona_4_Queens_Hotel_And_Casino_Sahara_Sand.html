<p>Dear Joeri,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section, and this is what I found https://www.masonslots.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion Limit. You can set a Self-Exclusion Limit for 6 months, 9 months, 1 year or forever. Upon doing so your Player Account will immediately be disabled and you will be excluded from all promotional offers for the set period. You will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds when the limit is active. Upon its expiring your account will automatically be re-activated.</p>
<p>SELF-EXCLUSION BY REQUEST</p>
<p>You may also contact our support team at support@masonslots.com and inform us about your decision to stop gambling at the Website for a certain period of time or forever. We will take all measures to block your access to your account and make sure that you receive no promotional materials.</p>
<p>If you are self excluded from the casino you won't be able to log into your account and order withdrawal of any balance you have left. Once self-excluded, please reach out to our support team at support@masonslots.com in order to initiate withdrawal of remaining balance. Our support team will contact you within a reasonable timeframe with information on the withdrawal and will assist you with it. Please note that active self-exclusion does not make you exempt from verification procedure if it's required by the casino to process funds. The funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits."</p>
<p>Could you please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to petronela.k@casino.guru? Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
