    <h1>Casino Wisconsin Casinos Near Orlando Nearest Casino To Me Casino Chicago Thunder Valley Casino Reso</h1>

<p>A day after Gaming Innovation Group and Sportnco came to the aid of Crab Sports in Maryland, the companies are now spearheading their expansion in Colombia and Latin America in general. Sportnco, which is owned by GiG, provides sports betting companies with the architecture and software necessary to run their operations.</p>
<p>GiG Uses Sportnco to Secure New Market Opportunities</p>
<p>GiG has confirmed that it has already signed a partnership with a tier-one operator, but the company has not provided further details than that. Sportnco, which has given a significant technological boost to GiG was purchased for €51.3 million ($54.88 million) in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The expansion in Colombia is done on Sportnco’s terms as well, as the company is already powering another company in the country, namely by providing its player account management (PAM). This makes for a third market in which GiG is providing both its services and dedicated software solutions and that would help it expand regionally, and beyond.</p>
<p>Sportnco managing director Hervé Schlosser welcomed the opportunity to make the company’s products accessible.</p>
<p>Choosing GiG and Sportnco as Sign of Trust</p>
<p>He thanked the unnamed operator for placing its trust in the GiG’s offering and confirmed that the company was committed to staying in Colombia for the long-term:</p>
<p>“The growing demand is a clear sign that we have created a sportsbook solution that is recognized as an industry leader within the igaming industry.”</p>
<p>GiG is also pleased to be joining the Colombian market itself. The potential of sports betting in the country is significant and online gross revenue in 2021 sat at $420 million, citing data by H2 Gambling Capital, an industry consultancy and analytics firm. Most of this revenue is generated through sports betting.</p>
