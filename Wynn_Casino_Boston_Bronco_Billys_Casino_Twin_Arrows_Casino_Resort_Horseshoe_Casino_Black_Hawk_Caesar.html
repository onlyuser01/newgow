    <h1>Wynn Casino Boston Bronco Billys Casino Twin Arrows Casino Resort Horseshoe Casino Black Hawk Caesar</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>my account has been fully verified since day 1. That was 11/20/22. I uploaded my documents and then in my profile I saw that the account was successfully verified.</p>
<p>The last communication was on 11/22/22. Of course, I appealed the decision. I then received the following email, which is also very dubious and contradictory:</p>
<p>Dear account holder,</p>
<p>You know very well what is all about. We are not saying you have more than one account. We respect fair play.</p>
<p>We have collected all evidence needed for connection between both accounts "Vbeetle" and "Simon9119" (we are not saying you are one person).</p>
<p>Again, please read our terms and conditions:</p>
<p>Please read these Terms very carefully as they form a binding legal agreement between you - our customer (the "Customer") - and us (the "Ditobet").</p>
<p>By using, visiting and/or opening an account (the "Account") and using the Service you agree to be bound by:</p>
<p>these Terms;</p>
<p>our Privacy Policy (including Cookies Policy);</p>
<p>our Betting Rules (including all rules applicable to our betting or gaming products)</p>
<p>our AML and KYC Policy</p>
<p>If you do not accept the Terms, do not use the Website. Where you play any game, or place a bet or wager, using the website, you accept and agree to be bound by the Rules which apply to the applicable products available on the website.</p>
<p>2.5. You are only allowed to register one account with Ditobet. Accounts are subject to immediate closure if it is found that you have multiple Accounts registered with us. This includes the use of representatives, relatives, associates, affiliates, related parties, connected persons, and/ or third parties operating on your behalf. You can have only one account per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, IP address, mobile device and/or shared computer, ie public library or workplace. If we have good reason to believe that you have opened several accounts with the intent to defraud the Company, we reserve the right to immediately close all of them.</p>
<p>In fact, I was only refunded my deposit of 222 euros on 11/22/22, but my winnings were completely forfeited. The company still owes me â‚¬3700.</p>
<p>I've been playing Live Blackjack since 11/20/22 for the most part.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, I am not the only person affected who has had such experiences. You can find identical testimonials in Trustpilot and it's no coincidence. I read the reports afterwards, otherwise I would never have played there.</p>
