<p>Only four more races are left before the end of the regular season of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series. The next one on the schedule is the FireKeepers Casino 400 race at Michigan International Speedway on Sunday, August 6</p>
<p>The FireKeepers Casino 400 is one of the two NASCAR races that have been organized at the Michigan International Speedway sporadically since 1969. The other one is the June race, which was last held three years ago when we saw Kevin Harvick triumph. It was his first-ever win in the June race, while in the August race – a.k.a. the FireKeepers Casino 400 – he’s the most successful active driver.</p>
<p>Harvick has five FireKeepers Casino 400 wins in his portfolio, and if he wins again, he’s going to set the record as the most successful driver in the history of the August event. Oddsmakers believe that he has a good chance of doing so, although he’s not the No. 1 favorite. Instead, it’s Kyle Larson who’s got the shortest NASCAR odds.</p>
<p>2023 FireKeepers Casino 400 Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Kyle Larson +600 Kevin Harvick +700 Denny Hamlin +700 Martin Truex Jr. +750 Kyle Busch +800 William Byron +800 Christopher Bell +1200 Tyler Reddick +1200 Ryan Blaney +1200 Chase Elliott +1400 Bubba Wallace +1400 Joey Logano +1600 Ross Chastain +2000 Brad Keselowski +2500 Ty Gibbs +3500 Alex Bowman +4000 Chris Buescher +4100</p>

<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Michigan International Speedway, Michigan</p>
<p>: Michigan International Speedway, Michigan Date : Sunday, August 6, 2023</p>
<p>: Sunday, August 6, 2023 Time : 2:30 PM ET</p>

<p>Kyle Larson Ready to Get Back on the Podium</p>
<p>Kyle Larson is eighth in the NASCAR Drivers’ Championship with just one win in 2023. He was very close to winning the 2023 HighPoint.com 400 at Pocono, but Denny Hamlin bumped him from behind, which resulted in Larson’s car hitting the wall.</p>
<p>Larson bumped him back – or should we say tapped his car – at Richmond last week, but that did not affect Hamlin. On the contrary, he got himself the No. 2 finish, while Larson finished in the 19th position.</p>
<p>That just isn’t good for a driver of his skillset, who also has one of the best cars in the 2023 NASCAR. That’s why you can be 100% certain Larson is going to do better at Michigan International Speedway on Sunday. But does this mean he’s going to win the race? Not if you’re asking Kevin Harvick.</p>
<p>Kevin Harvick Just Loves the Michigan International Speedway</p>
<p>The Michigan International Speedway is famous as the fastest track in NASCAR, which is why it’s loved by a certain type of driver. Kyle Larson definitely belongs to this category, but so does Kevin Harvick. Actually, this guy has the evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>He’s the man who’s got six wins on this racetrack, five of which happened in the June race, and one that happened in the FireKeepers Casino 400 event. The latter happened in 2022, which makes him the reigning champ.</p>
<p>All of this makes Harvick one of the top candidates for another triumph, but he’s not the driver with the shortest NASCAR odds. The reason for this is that he just hasn’t been too impressive in 2023. In fact, he is still without a single-race win this season.</p>
<p>FireKeepers Casino 400 Prediction</p>
<p>Kevin Harvick is without a win in 2023, but the FireKeepers Casino 400 race is where his wait could end. This is the best shot he’ll get this season to win a race, and if he doesn’t win it, we probably won’t see him win anything this year.</p>
<p>Pick: Kevin Harvick to win</p>
