<p>Wynn Las Vegas Savages Fontainebleau Using Justin Timberlake</p>

<p>Wynn Las Vegas took a savage potshot at the younger, hipper competitor focusing the world’s attention on the north side of the Strip this week. That potshot involved Justin Timberlake, the headliner of the Fontainebleau’s grand opening.</p>
<p>After the party, Timberlake shared a photo on social media taken from behind him and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, as they traipsed back to their hotel room.</p>
<p>The Wynn’s savage Instagram post, right, was later deleted, but not before it was screen-captured by Casino.org‘s own Vital Vegas blog. On the left is Justin Timberlake’s original Instagram post, which remains up. (Image: Instagram and Scott Roeben/Vital Vegas)</p>
<p>Only casino carpetologists — and those are a thing— noticed from the carpet patterns that it was The Wynn they were traipsing through, not Fontainebleau. The Wynn responded with its own Instagram post on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to TMZ, rooms at the Fontainebleau weren’t available on Wednesday to members of the public, who also weren’t allowed to enter the Fontainebleau until 12:01 a.m. on Thursday. By that time, all of the celebrities had already been ushered into a private high-limit room to watch Timberlake roll the casino’s ceremonial first craps shoot.</p>
<p>However, rooms were available on Wednesday to Timberlake, Biel, and any other invited VIP guests, presumably for free.</p>
<p>Only at Wynn</p>
<p>Wynn execs knew full well where the power couple chose to stay instead since they were the ones who booked them. However, the identity of guests is fiercely guarded as a paramount rule of luxury resorts, so they kept mum about it.</p>
<p>Until word spread about Timberlake’s gaffe.</p>
<p>The Wynn captioned the same photo of the power couple: “Where everyone ends up. #OnlyatWynn.”</p>
<p>As Vital Vegas noted, The Wynn has had a contentious relationship with its new neighbor, threatening to sue Fontainebleau this summer for poaching its best employees.</p>
<p>What Goes Around … Comes Around</p>
<p>Most celebrity performers don’t stay in the Las Vegas resorts where they perform. This is mostly to shake stalkers and fans searching for them there.</p>
<p>When Adele first came to town in November 2022 to perform at Caesars Palace, for example, the superstar was booked into the Palazzo Suites at the Rio, which Caesars Palace parent Caesars Entertainment owns.</p>
<p>But unintentional snubs can sting just as harshly as intentional ones. Often, appearance matters more than intention does.</p>
<p>Timberlake was paid $6 million to sing for an hour for Cher, Kim Kardashian, and the other VIPs packing the newest Strip casino’s private grand opening Wednesday night, December 13. Yet all that money couldn’t buy his loyalty for a single night?</p>
<p>The Wynn later deleted its post, no doubt reconsidering it as a betrayal of Timberlake, which it was. However, it was up long enough to get screen-captured by Vital Vegas and TMZ.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Adele didn’t like her digs at the Rio and later upgraded to — guess where — The Wynn.</p>
