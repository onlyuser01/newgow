    <h1>Map Of Casinos On The Strip Pa Online Casino Apps Casinos In Utah Twin River Social Casino Free Spin</h1>

<p>I used a deposit code for free spins in April 4. Used it correctly, went through the play through , cashed out the max amount. (A little over a grand). Verification took a long time. Back n forth multiple times, telling me I didn’t send certain things when I literally have record of it in my sent box. Finally on April 19, received email that verification was complete. Submitted my Withdrawal for the full amount on 4/19, Received $300 on 4/22. Submitted the remaining withdrawal amount of $700 on 4/22. Today is 4/28, it is still pending. They did respond and say it could take up to 3 business days(in rare cases more) so apparently I am a rare case.</p>
<p>The hoops people have to jump through are insane. I am shocked at their rating on here. How frustrating for the customer and the employees. I mean how much easier would it be to just send the full amount. Why does player ranking matter on cash out?. I wanted to play there again but the time it takes to withdrawal is very inconvenient. Im sure my most recent $700 WD request(when approved) will only be $300. Then I’ll have to submit another one. And then one more after that. It’s literally going to be Mid May, possibly end of May for one $1000 payout to be complete. I can cash out at other online casino and see my BTC in my wallet within hours, $7500. Seems to be "delay tactics" but that doesn’t work when you put a max WD amount on a bonus. It’s not working in your favor. If there was no max WD amount I 100% would have lost it all by now. Is this how long it will be every time I try to cash out in the future? I am a daily player so a weeks wait time for 1/4 of a payout may not work for me in the future. That’s a full month before I can deposit and play again without breaking your terms. Make it make sense please.</p>
