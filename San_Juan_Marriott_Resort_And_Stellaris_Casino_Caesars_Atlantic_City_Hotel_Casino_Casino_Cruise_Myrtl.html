<p>Alejandro Tengco said that only regulated gambling can minimize gambling-related crimes in the Philippines</p>
<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has issued a “stern warning” to its offshore licensees and accredited service providers, asking them to comply with the local rules.</p>
<p>The body’s chair and chief executive officer, Alejandro Tengco, addressed gambling companies in the country, reminding them that they are legally obliged to operate within the bounds of their licenses.</p>
<p>In addition, licensed companies were asked to refrain from involvement in any criminal activity, lest they risk severe penalties and possible license suspension or cancellation.</p>
<p>An Inter-Agency Operation Cracked Down on CGC Technologies</p>
<p>The warning came amid a suspension order that the PAGCOR issued to CGC Technologies. On May 4, the Philippine National Police’s Anti-Cybercrime Group, the Special Action Forces, the Intelligence Group of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission and the Inter-Agency Council on Anti-Trafficking probed into the service provider’s business.</p>
<p>The inter-agency operation was conducted inside the Sun Valley Business Hub in Mabalacat, Pampanga, following suspicions of possible credit card fraud, illegal detention and even human trafficking.</p>
<p>The investigation showed that CGC Technologies operated in six buildings, despite only two being accredited by the PAGCOR. The people working there were of mixed nationalities and, according to the state-owned company, included Indonesians, Vietnamese, Nepalese, Bhutanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>During the raid, the law enforcers confiscated 1,000 computers and devices and subjected them to forensic investigation. Thanks to this, the PAGCOR was able to confirm that the establishments were indeed conducting illegal activities.</p>
<p>The findings led to the PAGCOR immediately canceling CGC Technologies’ accreditation.</p>
<p>PAGCOR Vowed to Protect the Local Market</p>
<p>The operation, Tengco said, was a result of PAGCOR’s intensified cooperation with various governmental organizations, including the Office of the President, Department of Justice, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Philippine National Police, National Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Immigration.</p>
<p>Tengco added that the PAGCOR will continue to closely monitor the market and take action when fraudulent activity is identified.</p>
<p>The PAGCOR also supported the Department of Justice and Bureau of Immigration in their decision to order the immediate repatriation of the foreigners that were rescued during the raid. The PAGCOR said that this highlights its strong stance against illegal activities in the country.</p>
<p>Tengco promised that the PAGCOR will continue working with state agencies to make the local</p>
<p>PAGCOR will continue to work hand in hand with law enforcement agencies to ensure a safe and responsible gaming environment not only for Filipinos but also for other nationalities. Only through regulated and responsible gaming can we minimize, if not totally eradicate all crimes that are being linked to gaming activities. Alejandro Tengco, chair &amp; CEO, PAGCOR</p>
<p>On a similar note, in March, the PAGCOR terminated its contract with an auditor that had provided fake documents.</p>
