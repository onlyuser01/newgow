<p>Dear wkuoch1978,</p>
<p>As for your claims above:</p>
<p>yes, that is correct - VPN is used for security reasons, and it is a common thing, but not in case you need to hide your location and circumvent online casino restrictions</p>
<p>you did not make a deposit to play, you only made the deposit to withdraw your winnings, while there were no signs of play for real money</p>
<p>I dare to disagree with the claim that it is not your fault - you knowingly breached the casino's terms and conditions, which you accepted upon registration</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and evidence, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - you bypassed the casino's restrictions by using VPN to hide your current location. Otherwise, you would not be able to even open the casino website. This seriously breached the casino's rules and restrictions. Apart from hiding your location, you used several consecutive no-deposit bonuses without making deposits between them. We are talking about free money given by the casino, which the casino can limit as it sees fit, especially in the case of no-deposit bonuses. The casino's rules regarding no-deposit bonuses are clear, and also those are accepted upon registration.</p>
<p>If all players play in online casinos in this way, it would not make sense for casinos to provide their services to players at all. In addition, your confirmation deposit was refunded. You basically lost nothing, and even could use the casino's services despite its restrictions, and play there. The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision. Unfortunately, you are not entitled to the winnings obtained this way.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Nick and Crypto Loko Casino, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
