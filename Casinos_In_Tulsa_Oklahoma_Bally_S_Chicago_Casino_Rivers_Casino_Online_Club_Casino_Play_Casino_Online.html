<p>South Australian Liquor and Gambling Commissioner Dini Soulio has asked SkyCity Adelaide to appoint an independent expert to revise its AML and CTF programs</p>
<p>In July 2022, the Honourable Brian Martin, an officer of the Order of Australia and King’s Counsel, was put in charge of reviewing SkyCity Adelaide’s suitability to preserve its monopoly casino license.</p>
<p>Now, commissioner Soulio has sent a direction notice to SkyAdelaide using Section 10 part of the Gambling Administration Act 2019, asking them to name a suitability qualified independent expert.</p>
<p>The Direction, a Consequence of Hon Brian Martin AO KC’s Investigation</p>
<p>Hon Brian Martin AO KC’s independent review initiated last July under section 22(2) of the Casino Act 1997 was also aimed at determining whether SkyCity should continue its collaboration with SkyCity Adelaide Pty Limited.</p>
<p>On February 6, the Consumer and Business Services, which is South Australia’s gaming regulator, informed SkyCity Entertainment Group Limited that Martin’s review was put on hold.</p>
<p>This was due to the pending resolution of the civil penalty proceedings that had been filed by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center against the premiere casino located on the banks of the River Torrens in December 2022.</p>
<p>After closely considering his next action while his review was on hold, commissioner Martin finally sent a notice to SkyAdelaide, urging them to appoint a qualified independent suitability expert.</p>
<p>The expert would have to receive the approval of the same South Australian Liquor and Gambling Commissioner.</p>
<p>What Will the Independent Expert Do?</p>
<p>The independent expert will be responsible for revising and amending SkyCity Adelaide’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing programs while supervising the implementation of the responsibility enhancement programs.</p>
<p>The appointed expert will also need to conduct similar procedures related to the minimization of gambling harm and report back to the commissioner to inform him of the latest updates.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by SkyCity, the decision should offer an “independent perspective” of the casino’s AML and counter-terrorism financing programs while adding an additional layer of assurance.</p>
<p>The Auckland-based group, one of Australasia’s top entertainment and gaming companies, also stated they would keep working with Consumer and Business Services and comply with any additional information and document requests.</p>
<p>At the moment, SkyCity Adelaide represents Adelaide’s 10th largest employer, injecting approximately $30 million into the state on a yearly basis each with the help of its staff that consists of more than 1,000 members.</p>
<p>Since it was built almost four decades ago, SkyCity Adelaide has continued to go through essential upgrades to guarantee it remains “the most exciting entertainment venue in Adelaide.”</p>
<p>The publicly-listed SkyCity Entertainment Group currently employs more than 3,400 people in Australia and New Zealand. The group is also the owner and operator of a series of casinos in Queenstown, Hamilton, and Auckland.</p>
