<p>Hi Lynn/Villiam,</p>
<p>At the time of receiving this complaint, I had launched an inquiry into the withdrawal processing on your account.</p>
<p>From what I was able to see, and what I had communicated on this thread from the account management portal side, there didn't seem to be an issue. This is the feedback that you would have received from the support teams side as well.</p>
<p>It was only after receiving feedback on the inquiry, which was yesterday, that we had found that there was no way that the withdrawal could possibly have been successfully processed.</p>
<p>Now, there had been some procedural issues, which the investigator was glad to identify, in order to ensure that this type of issue doesn't occur again in the future, my apologies that you had to go through all this. Previous reference numbers provided were correct based on what was displayed on the transaction, however, there were certain inconsistencies on the front end data, and back end data, entries on the payment details, meaning those funds would never have reached your bank account.</p>
<p>The reason I hadn't provided you with this feedback yesterday, is that I took a look at the service you have received, as well as communication and placed myself in the same position and thought to myself, "Would I believe these people, without any proof". I then opted to request a proof of payment, as high priority, and was planning on sending this feedback to you today.</p>
<p>Of course, you receiving the withdrawal was always the ultimate goal, so I am glad to see that you have. I can't really blame you for having the opinion that you have regarded the Casino, from my side, I am just really glad that you have received your funds. Under normal circumstances, I would have offered a credit for the inconvenience you had experienced, this is however not an option based on the account status.</p>
<p>Once again, apologies for this experience.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Vegas Lounge Casino</p>
