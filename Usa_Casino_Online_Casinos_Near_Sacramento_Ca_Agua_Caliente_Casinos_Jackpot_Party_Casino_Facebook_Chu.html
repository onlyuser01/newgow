<p>PartyPoker has updated its mobile FastForward app to be available in portrait mode.</p>
<p>FastForward Now Available in Portrait Mode</p>
<p>PartyPoker is always integrating new and interesting features to its online poker offering. New games and functions are continually added to the software, and PartyPoker’s latest update changes the way players enjoy the FastForward mobile app.</p>
<p>The fastforward game on PartyPoker’s mobile app is now available to play in portrait mode. While this may not sound like a big deal if you’re used to playing in landscape, try switching to portrait-orientated games; you’ll notice how much simpler and intuitive the controls are.</p>
<p>Portrait mode allows players to enjoy fastforward poker using only one hand, whereas landscape games require you to hold your device in both hands. This makes it much easier for you to play while you’re on the go, which is important for a mobile poker app.</p>
<p>“This app brings poker on your phone into the modern age. The experience of just being able to play with one finger is something I have never had the chance to experience before. It’s so simple and intuitive! It’s by far the best poker app I have played on my phone. So simple to use and fun!” – reads a statement from PokerStars</p>
<p>FastForward poker has also been integrated into PartyPoker’s social gaming initiative. As such, players will now be able to bet and win Diamonds, the in-game currency that players can use to purchase emojis and other interesting items.</p>
<p>This really is an interesting new era for PartyPoker. It’s only the beginning of 2020, so we’re sure to see many more exciting additions to the brand’s software on both mobile and desktop platforms.</p>
<p>About FastForward Poker</p>
<p>If you don’t know about fastforward poker yet, it’s a game that’s played at an incredibly quick pace. You enter into a normal game of Texas Hold’em poker but, whenever you fold your hand, you’re immediately moved to another table.</p>
<p>This allows players to fit in hundreds of hands per hour. It’s ideal for grinders out there, who want to increase their win rate. However, casual players will enjoy it, as well, as it makes for a fast-paced gaming experience that doesn’t require loads of strategic thought.</p>
<p>This is the second offering at PartyPoker to be launched in portrait mode. The first was SPINS, which began using the orientation in November 2019. We’re hoping to see more of PartyPoker’s mobile games to adopt portrait mode, making it easier for mobile players to enjoy their favourite poker games.</p>
