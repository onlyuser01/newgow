<p>Unibet Interactive, the US sports betting brand of Kindred Group, received this week a mobile sports betting permit in Virginia to expand its presence into 4 states.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add Virginia to the growing list of states that Unibet and Kindred Group call home as we continue our expansion in the US market.”</p>
<p>First-Class Sportsbook Experience</p>
<p>The mobile sports betting permit awarded by the Virginia Lottery will offer customers at Unibet Sports &amp; Racebook in the Old Dominion a “first-class sportsbook experience” as Unibet strongly believes Virginia will turn out to be a key state for the East Coast expansion.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to go live shortly and we expect that the success we have seen in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Indiana will of course follow in Virginia.” Manuel Stan, SVP USA, Kindred Group</p>
<p>As Virginia is one of the largest states in the US, analysts believe the state’s sports betting market could easily reach $370 million in annual revenues at maturity.</p>
<p>“We are very grateful to the Virginia Lottery for awarding us one of the seven stand-alone mobile sports betting permits in a very competitive process. We look forward to opening an office in Virginia, which will function as our third hub together with our offices in New York and New Jersey.” Manuel Stan, SVP USA, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Presence in Key States</p>
<p>The pending launch in Virginia will be the 4th for the sports betting brand which already established a presence in key US markets – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana – and has secured market access for another 8 states, California and Arizona among the latest.</p>
<p>In February, Unibet signed a 10-year deal with the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation to secure early market access for mobile and retail sports betting in Arizona and California – two states which are not quite there with regards to the legalization of sports betting – subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue our journey in what we believe will become the largest gambling market in the world.” Manuel Stan, SVP USA, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Unibet outlined that it would continue to invest in growing its operations in the US and expand into markets that allow for a sustainable business model.</p>
<p>The sports betting brand is also committed to providing responsible gaming to its customers after becoming the first US betting operator to offer its clients access to Gamban self-exclusion software which allows gambling websites to be blocked on any device.</p>
