    <h1>Tampa Casino Rivers Casino Resort Schenectady Foxwood Casino Seminole Casino Immokalee Florida Casin</h1>

<p>Today I was excluded from the bonus for a completely unknown reason. The problem is that I still got offers. Since I was not informed about the exclusion and I found the offer good, I paid via the direct link from the email as usual, but received neither the described offer nor an answer from the support. Well, I thought and I continued to fall in love with my day normally until I received an SMS with the same offer and I tried again via the link of the SMS, counted again and nothing happened again. Now I thought it was up to the system and contacted the otherwise really friendly support via chat. 2 hours waiting time? Of course, it locks out automatically after 15 minutes and you then have to wait again. You can find the conversation in the appendix as a screenshot. I don't know a reason so far. I always liked the casinos of aspire because of the changing offers and nowhere is it written that you shouldn't just use them. After all, every single page is like mrmega.com or mrplay.com or or or standalone casinos and sites and none of these sites I have violated any guidelines or terms and conditions. On the contrary, I verified myself properly and always submitted everything that was requested. In the end I feel cheated because I was neither informed about an exclusion nor get any answer why it comes about. At the end of the song after months of fun, this was done to me because these casinos are uninteresting without any offers. Precisely because reaching new levels (bonus levels) takes a long time but is fun .... Only this bomussytsem and loyalty points now no longer make sense since you have been excluded from it even a platinum account is therefore worthless. So all the months for nothing. At the end of the story I had been informed that I had not taken advantage of the offer today. But they did not do this and still let me pay in but did not provide any service ... No one goes shopping and goes without the product on offer. What shoud that? Because there is no money back ... And when you ask to be able to speak to someone, you get an email whose answer is that it is a final decision of the menagemanets .... Only why and why everything remains open. I would understand if I had violated something but I didn't and I feel very betrayed. At aspire casinos you should always keep in mind that you will be lured by daily offers but there is a risk that without notification you will not get anything again. You will not get the money that you have deposited for a certain bonus or free spins. Small funct each casino promotes another with certain welcome bonuses. But apparently it is not allowed to use them? That makes no sense and is nowhere noted in the terms and conditions. Money away no answers ... Thank you for the successful day dear people of aspiere ..... But that's how it works when a giant company runs a thousand supposedly independent pages ... Only these cannot be so independent.</p>
