    <h1>Longhorn Casino Ballys Hotel Casino Cherokee Casino Hotel Epiphone Casino Coupe Casino Meme USMNT vs</h1>

<p>French off winning the CONCACAF Nations League, the USMNT is taking on Jamaica in the first game of the 2023 Gold Cup</p>
<p>The CONCACAF Gold Cup has been around since 1993, being organized every two years. The United States, Mexico, and Canada are the only three teams that have won this tournament so far, and oddsmakers suggest one of them will win again.</p>
<p>The USMNT is one of the biggest favorites, but their odds might change depending on how B. J. Callaghan’s men perform in the 2023 Gold Cup opener against Jamaica on Saturday, June 24.</p>

<p>USMNT Missing Several Stars in Their 2023 Gold Cup Roster</p>
<p>The Americans were great in the Nations League, which they won by beating Canada 2-0 in the Final with goals by Folarin Balogun and Chris Richards, each on an assist by Gio Reyna. In the semifinals, the USMNT defeated Mexico 3-0 with two goals by Christian Pulisic and one by Ricardo Pepi.</p>
<p>The trouble for the Americans is that none of the aforementioned players will take part in the 2023 Gold Cup. Instead, coach B. J. Callaghan decided to put his trust in players who don’t have too much experience playing for the national team. Out of the 23 players who got a call-up for the Gold Cup, only nine have 10+ caps for the United States national team.</p>
<p>Further, only eight members of the USMNT’s Gold Cup roster play outside the United States. However, excluding Arsenal’s backup goalie Matt Turner, none of them is expected to be in the spotlight against Jamaica. Instead, Callaghan will probably rely on MLS players on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Reggae Boyz” Ready to Stage an Upset</p>
<p>The probable reason why the USMNT is seen as a minus-money favorite is that Callaghan’s men are coming off a brilliant performance in the CONCACAF Nations League. However, most of those men are now on vacation. As a result, the US roster looks much weaker than the one in Jamaica.</p>
<p>“The Reggae Boyz” might not be on a great run lately, but they definitely have the manpower to go far in the 2023 Gold Cup. The core of this team is made up of players under contract with English teams – Demarai Gray (Everton), Leon Bailey (Aston Villa), Michail Antonio (West Ham), and others.</p>
<p>Further, they’ve got a couple of players from the MLS as well. For example, their goalkeeper Andre Blake is the goalie for the Philadelphia Union. Further, one of the New York Red Bulls’ best players Cory Burke is their forward.</p>
<p>USMNT vs. Jamaica Prediction</p>
<p>Jamaica might be a +350 underdog, but we think bookies are wrong. “The Reggae Boyz” are better than the USMNT and they’re going to show it on June 24. We expect them to dominate the game in the center of the pitch, keeping the ball in their possession for most of the time. As a result, they should be able to create just enough goal chances to make at least one of them count.</p>
<p>Pick: Jamaica to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
