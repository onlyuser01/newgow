    <h1>Vegas Rio Casino Online Map Of Casinos In Las Vegas Hotel Near Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Ca</h1>

<p>I want to caution you about this casino. I participated in two tournaments with 500k and 700k, respectively. I won a credit bonus of €30.14. I then turned those 30 euros into over 700 euros and requested a withdrawal of 600 euros.</p>
<p>After 18 days, I checked my player account and saw that the 600 euro withdrawal had been cancelled, with only 270 euros approved for payout.</p>
<p>When I inquired why only 270€ was being paid out, I was told that my winnings had come from a bonus.</p>
<p>All bonus games etc. offered in this casino have a limit and come with terms and conditions. However, I have screenshots proving that it was indeed a credit and not a bonus...</p>
