    <h1>Ime Casino Rising Star Casino Resort Casino Real Money Online Rio All Suite Hotel Casino Vegas Casin</h1>

<p>Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati will play host to one of the most iconic poker events in the history of the game</p>
<p>The event will be taking place at the Hard Rock Event Center specifically. Chris Moneymaker is known for his iconic win at the World Series of Poker when he turned an online qualifier into a seven-figure win. Since 2003, when Moneymaker won the event, the player has been in the public eye, and serving as an ambassador for the game.</p>
<p>Main Event with $1,500 Buy-in and $1M Guaranteed</p>
<p>Moneymaker won his entry into the 2003 WSOP Main Event from a $86 qualifier on PokerStars, and now, two decades after the fact, he is still busy running poker affairs. The event is named after the legend himself and will be running from September 21, 2023 through October 2, 2023 and feature more than $2 million in prize pool guarantees, along with 18 trophy events that players will have a chance to participate in.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the satellite tournaments for the event have a buy-in of $86, with the Moneymaker Main Event charging a $1,500 buy-in fee. It will also come with a $1 million prize pool guarantee and the main table is set to get underway on September 27, culminating at the final day of the series on October 2.</p>
<p>Players who want to play something different can enjoy the Moneymaker Mystery Bounty Event which costs $600 and has a $500,000 guarantee. Commenting on the opportunity to welcome such a seminal event on the premises, Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati poker room manager Chris Herbert said that the casino is excited to have Chris Moneymaker and the event’s first Moneymaker Tour stop in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Promoting Poker Across the United States</p>
<p>The games that will be available to players will feature quite a few Omaha and Texas Hold’em events, with Hold’em naturally the more popular format of the two. Meanwhile, Moneymaker executive manager Tony Burns has hailed the opportunity to work with Hard Rock and set up shop there for the Moneymaker Tour. “This is an amazing opportunity all around,” commented Burns.</p>
<p>Poker legends have been grabbing headlines a lot of late, with Daniel Negreanu, another top-ranking poker professional, recently looking in on a high-school graduate poker game and sitting down to play poker with the graduates who were excited to see their idol join in. Poker’s popularity has been increasing steadily across North America and the United States, not least owing to the continuous efforts of people like Moneymaker and Negreanu.</p>
