<p>Incentive Games has entered the US market after securing a deal to launch a series of free-to-play games on the sports wagering platforms that global-gaming giant Intralot operates in partnership with the Montana and Washington DC lotteries.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Partnership with Gaming Giant Intralot</p>
<p>Free-to-play games provider Incentive Games has inked a 36-month deal with Intralot to make its Margin Selector, Dream Team, and Bracket games available for NBA and NFL contests. The breakthrough partnership has started with the NCAA’s March Madness 2021 tournament.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of users are already playing Margin Selector on a daily basis, Incentive Games says. Moreover, more than 70% of customers have been playing the game for a few consecutive weeks now.</p>
<p>John Gordon, chief executive of Incentive Games, referred to Intralot as a leading operator in the global online and mobile gambling industry. Gordon added that the gaming operator is one of the most significant partners that Incentive Games has had so far.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Byron Boothe, CEO of Intralot said:</p>
<p>“We are pleased to partner with Incentive Games to provide players in Montana and Washington, DC added value through the addition of Free-To-Play games on our sports wagering platforms.”</p>
<p>Incentive Games is also confident that its expertise in providing B2B content across iGaming can help newly launched sports wagering brands Sports Bet Montana and GambetDC to expand and engage its customer base. Gordon added that the expanding US market will need companies, such as Incentive Games, who are skilled in acquiring and retaining players.</p>
<p>Incentive Games Expands Partnership Network with BtoBet</p>
<p>Incentive Games has also signed a partnership with BtoBet to provide the Aspire Global-owned operator with its portfolio of pay-to-play (P2P) virtual sports games. BtoBet customers from Latin America, Europe, and Africa will be able to enjoy titles such as Virtual-League: Penalties, and Virtual-League: Racing.</p>
<p>Sabrina Soldà, chief marketing officer at BtoBet said that Incentive Games’ free-to-play and pay-to-play games allow BtoBet’s partners to expand its audience reach through an appealing game format suitable for the devices of players. Soldà adds that F2P and P2P games are an important tool for acquiring, retaining, and engaging users through a cost-effective and entertaining model.</p>
<p>Incentive Games is a trusted game developer for markets with high cellular data costs that are an obstacle for players. Games have also been optimized for Opera Mini Extreme. Incentive Games’ products are also attractive for users that do not usually engage with regular casino games. This is especially helpful for operators in regions, where live sport has a limited supply.</p>
