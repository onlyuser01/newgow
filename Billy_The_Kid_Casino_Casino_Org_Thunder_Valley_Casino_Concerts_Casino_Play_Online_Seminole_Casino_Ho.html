    <h1>Billy The Kid Casino Casino Org Thunder Valley Casino Concerts Casino Play Online Seminole Casino Ho</h1>

<p>Thank you for your reply, George. Please note that your Casino.guru account has been created by you and I didn't choose the name of your account. I addressed you by the name you entered:</p>
<p>Now, I would like to emphasize that if it is true that your daughter created an account in your name, she breached one of the main casino rules - each player must enter correct and valid personal details about themselves. Another rule that has been breached - each player must deposit funds from a payment method issued in their own name.</p>
<p>Ask yourself a simple question - how was the casino supposed to know who created an account if she used the personal details of someone else?</p>
<p>Not to mention that if she had access to your card, she sure could easily find a way how to access your ID and other documents and verify the casino account (by the way, didn't you notice that quite a significant amount of money was leaving your bank account?). Sure, ideally, we think casinos should perform a verification before the first deposit was even made, but unless someone from the casino stood behind her while creating the account and playing, the casino had no way of knowing who was using it. Again, you must understand that casinos are not responsible for anyone's children.</p>
<p>The situation would be a little bit different if an underaged child created an account in their own name using the correct date of birth - I would admit that the casino doesn't have the best player protection tools, and we would for sure confront the casino.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I explained previously if the account was created in your name and deposits were made using payment methods issued in your name, it would be impossible to prove that the account was in fact used by someone else and I am more than sure you understand this.</p>
<p>Lastly, since you refused to provide the required documents, we cannot support you further in this case.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information we don't think you are entitled to a refund, and we are forced to reject this complaint as unjustified. Nonetheless, if you disagree with our decision, you can try contacting the licensing authority, but I don't think their opinion would be much different from ours.</p>
