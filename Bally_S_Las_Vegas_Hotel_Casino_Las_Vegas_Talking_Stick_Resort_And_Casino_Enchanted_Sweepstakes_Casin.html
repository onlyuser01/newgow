<p>Zamboglou, a veteran betting executive, will take charge of coordinating operations for 888's extensive brand portfolio in these regions, which includes popular names such as 888sport, 888casino, William Hill, and Mr Green</p>
<p>In a strategic move, 888 Holdings has named Alexis Zamboglou as the new Managing Director for its UK and Irish divisions.</p>
<p>Key Positions at William Hill Prepare Alexis Zamboglou for New Role at 888</p>
<p>Alexis Zamboglou brings a wealth of experience to his new role, having spent several years in key positions at William Hill. His tenure at the company began in 2020 when William Hill was still an independent business and a constituent of the FTSE100 index. Throughout his three-year and six-month stint, Zamboglou held various roles, including UK Strategy Director, Marketing Director, and dual role as UK Marketing Director and Managing Director for Ireland.</p>
<p>During this time, William Hill underwent significant changes, with the acquisition of the company and its Mr Green iGaming brand by Caesars Entertainment in 2021. Subsequently, in September 2021, 888 acquired William Hill’s non-US assets, integrating them into its own portfolio in February 2022.</p>
<p>Zamboglou’s appointment comes at a crucial juncture for both 888 and the UK and Irish betting sectors as a whole, with ongoing legislative and regulatory changes. The UK is currently in a consultation period regarding the recommendations of the long-awaited White Paper, while Ireland is moving forward with a bill to re-regulate its gambling sector.</p>
<p>Zamboglou Takes the Reins at 888, Excited to Lead UK and Irish Business</p>
<p>Announcing his new role on LinkedIn, Zamboglou stated: “I am hugely excited to get the opportunity to run the UK and Irish business, with some of the biggest brands on the globe in William Hill, 888, and Mr Green. Really looking forward to working across sports, gaming, and marketing with some of the most talented teams in the industry and building on the success we’ve had so far in 2023.”</p>
<p>Zamboglou’s appointment follows the promotion of Phil Walker, the former Managing Director for the UK and Ireland, to the position of chief commercial officer at 888. These changes reflect 888’s commitment to strengthening its leadership team and driving growth in the UK and Irish markets.</p>
<p>There has been some reshuffling in top positions at 888 in the past month. Just days ago Yariv Lavi, 888’s director of business development, announced his departure from the company after spending more than 13.5 years there.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Shai Tabibian, the SVP head of B2C at 888 Holdings, also announced he is leaving the company after 9 years of service.At the same time, the UK Gambling Commission is reviewing 888 Holdings’ operating license following the termination of discussions with proposed former GVC executives amid concerns over bribery investigations.</p>
