<p>PointsBet has entered Virginia, expanding its footprint and betting platform to another jurisdiction in the US in the process. The company has been awarded a temporary supplier license by the state lottery, which enables it to offer interactive sports betting products in Virginia.</p>
<p>Another Successful Launch in the US</p>
<p>PointsBet teamed up with Colonial Downs Group to secure market access as the company continues to scale its operations in North America. Commenting on this opportunity, PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken welcomed the opportunity to bring the company’s state-of-the-art product to residents and sports fans of Virginia:</p>
<p>“Being awarded the opportunity to offer PointsBet’s market-leading speed and ease of use, unrivaled slate of betting options, and overall in-play excellence to the people of Virginia is a great achievement and responsibility.” PointsBet USA CEO Johnny Aitken</p>
<p>Aitken said that the company was excited to be teaming with both the Virginia Lottery and Colonial Downs. He argued that PointsBet will continue working on its existing relationship with NBC Sports and will leverage it in the newly accessed state as well.</p>
<p>A Good Stepping-Stone for PointsBet</p>
<p>The news was equally welcomed by Colonial Downs Group COO Aaron Gomes, who said that the company was pleased to be adding PointsBet as a partner in the state. As a result, Colonial Downs will be able to provide its own loyal customers with various betting and gaming products, boosting engagement.</p>
<p>PointsBet strength lies not only in its existing sports betting software but also in the exclusive partnership it has arranged with NBC Sports, giving it leeway to leverage digital assets and drive brand messaging home with Virginian audiences.</p>
<p>NBC Sports allows PointsBet to tap into various regional broadcasts featuring the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, and the company’s Spanish language functionality can further complement the Telemundo Deportes and Telemundo broadcast stations.</p>
<p>PointsBet has already provided an update of its Q1 FY2022 results in October, marking a 42% turnover increase. The company has been building across the board in North America, hiring talent in both Canada and the United States to bolster its presence in both markets.</p>
<p>Kyle Christensen was appointed as chief marketing officer for the United States just last month. The sportsbook also tapped Chris Simms as the latest addition to its content team.</p>
