<p>The #6 Miami Dolphins vs. #3 Kansas City Chiefs is a 2024 NFL Wild Card game, which will take place at Arrowhead on Saturday, January 13</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are a team that struggles against favorites, but now would be an ideal time for Mike McDaniel’s men to change that. They’re coming to Kansas City as 3.5-point underdogs, which is a spread they haven’t covered in years. Will that change on Saturday evening?</p>

<p>Are Miami Dolphins Ready to Slay a Real Giant?</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins finished the regular season with an 11-6 record, finishing second in the AFC East Division.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that each time they were the underdog in the eyes of the bookies, they lost – vs. the Buffalo Bills (twice), Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, and even the Kansas City Chiefs. What’s also interesting is that four of their six losses in 2023 happened on the road.</p>
<p>Another bad news for them is that in they are winless against the Chiefs in the Patrick Mahomes era. In fact, the last time they won against this opponent was in 2011.</p>
<p>As if all this wasn’t enough, there are also reports of bad weather coming to Missouri this coming weekend. Tua Tagovailoa is famous for being a quarterback who doesn’t do great in cold weather, so the fact that it’s gonna be around 7°F at the kickoff time is very bad news for him and the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs to Show Why They’re Lombardi Winners</p>
<p>The winners of last year’s Super Bowl haven’t been too impressive this season, but they did advance to the postseason. The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11-6 record, winning the AFC West Division and booking a ticket to the Wild Card Round.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that they went 5-4 at Arrowhead, which used to be their fortress in the previous seasons. Well, maybe it still is – we’ll see on Saturday.</p>
<p>A huge crowd is expected for this game, which is their first home match of 2024. More than 75,000 fans are expected to come to watch Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and all the other KC superstars.</p>
<p>They’re all fit and ready to play, even though they missed the regular season finale last weekend. Coach Andy Reid just didn’t want to risk any injuries, but even with his B-team, he won against the Los Angeles Chargers 13-12.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs. Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs look destined to win this game. Everything is going in their favor ahead of Saturday’s match – they’re in good form, they’ve got their fans to support them, and the cold weather is probably going to have a disastrous effect on their opponents who are used to playing in sunny Miami.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs -3.5</p>
