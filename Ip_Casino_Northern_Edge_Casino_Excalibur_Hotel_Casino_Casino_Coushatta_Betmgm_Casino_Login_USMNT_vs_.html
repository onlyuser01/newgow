    <h1>Ip Casino Northern Edge Casino Excalibur Hotel Casino Casino Coushatta Betmgm Casino Login USMNT vs</h1>

<p>The USMNT vs. Mexico game on Thursday, June 15, 2023, is a semifinal duel of the League A of the CONCACAF Nations League</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Weston McKennie, and Gio Reyna – all the biggest stars of the United States men’s national soccer team (USMNT) will play in the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League Finals. Mexico’s superstars (e.g., Jesus Corona, Hirving Lozano, Raul Jimenez, etc.), on the other hand, have not come to Nevada, which explains why this team’s odds are somewhere in the ballpark of +200 right now.</p>

<p>The USMNT Players are Pumped for the June 15 Game</p>
<p>B. J. Callaghan’s boys are very optimistic about the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League Finals. They believe they can win the trophy, but for that to happen, they first need to beat Mexico on June 15. Their confidence isn’t unjustified, though. The USMNT’s roster for Thursday’s game looks great, with all of America’s best soccer players ready to give their utmost.</p>
<p>The man in the spotlight is Christian Pulisic who’s been nothing short of brilliant in the US jersey. He was great in the 2022 World Cup, which is something that’s probably motivated him to do even better in 2023. This year, he’s played twice for his national team in the CONCACAF Nations League group stage, scoring one goal and making two assists in two along the way.</p>
<p>Other USMNT stars – Timothy Weah, Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, etc. – were also brilliant in those games. Plus, Team US now has a rising star in the final third. The young gun in question is Groningen’s 20-year-old striker Ricardo Pepi, who scored three goals in his last two games for the national team.</p>
<p>Team Mexico Relying on Liga MX Players</p>
<p>Mexico’s arguably biggest star is Hirving Lozano who’s playing for the new Italian Serie A champion Napoli. Jesus Corona of the 2023 Europa League winner Sevilla is also out there, the same as Wolverhampton’s Raul Jimenez. However, none of these players will take part in the June 15 CONCACAF Nations League game.</p>
<p>Instead, coach Diego Cocca will have to rely mostly on the players from the Mexican Liga MX. In fact, of the 23 players who’ve traveled to Nevada this week, only eight play outside Mexico. Apart from Ajax’s Edson Alvarez, AEK Athens’s Orbelin Pineda, and Salernitana’s Guillermo Ochoa, they’re not going to play an important role against the USMNT.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean that the players from Mexico’s domestic league aren’t good. On the contrary, Cocca’s got some pretty decent Liga MX players at his disposal, including Club America’s striker Henry Martin, Cruz Azul’s winger Uriel Antuna, and Monterrey’s full-back Jesus Gallardo.</p>
<p>USMNT vs. Mexico Prediction</p>
<p>The USMNT has a better roster than Mexico, but the visitors play attacking-minded soccer, which is why we wouldn’t be surprised if they made it very difficult for the Americans. Still, we think that the hosts will triumph in the end.</p>
<p>Picks: United States to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
