    <h1>Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Sahara Casino Las Vegas Waterloo Casino Plaza Casino Las Vegas Circus Ci</h1>

<p>I made a deposit and then won around 2000€, when I tried to make a withdrawal they tried to delay it as much as possible with documents etc.</p>
<p>At that point I noticed there is something fishy going on when I read about 1000€ max withdrawal and up to 14days withdrawal processing time..</p>
<p>Then I tried to press the withdraw button, well there wasn't one!</p>
<p>Then I contacted chat I was told in their customer service chat that I need to make another 50€ deposit to withdraw my 1000€, I tried to ask why and where could I find this in the rules the chat operator told me that this was "this was explained to you by management".</p>
<p>Later I contacted chat and got explained that it happened to be a "bug" (wonder to how many people this bug happens) and there was no such rule requiring 2deposits.</p>
<p>This added a significant delay to my first withdrawal process so In the weekend I ended up canceling my withdrawals and lost around 2000€ while I was drunk, later I contacted their management and was told that it was my own reason that I lost and has nothing to do with the fact that the withdrawal process got delayed because of a "bug" that was first explained to me as a rule.</p>
<p>Then they tried to silence me with 130€ which according to them consisted of my deposits to the site, which was 150€ actually. I was accepting the loss of the another 1000€ but this first withdrawal could have been processed on time.</p>
<p>This is propably their way of doing things, avoid at all costs, even the license seems weird Curacao geming, under laws of belize payments processed in chech?</p>
