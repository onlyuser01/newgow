    <h1>Green Valley Ranch Hotel Casino Restaurants Inside Foxwoods Casino Allegheny Casino Jokers Wild Casi</h1>

<p>The Massachusetts regulator has identified a number of illegal collegiate sports bets at the two gambling venues</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission, the gambling regulator in the Bay State, will evaluate recent rule violations and decide whether to impose penalties. The authority will discuss the matter at a meeting scheduled for April 14.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Massachusetts’ fresh sports betting market quickly attracted illegal bets. In February this year, the regulator identified two illegal wagers on collegiate sports. In total, $1,230 was bet illegally within the first month of sports betting in the state. The two bets stood at $1,150 and $80 and yielded total winnings of $1,106.</p>
<p>According to earlier reports, MGM Springfield accepted these wagers by mistake and was reportedly unaware of them taking place. The operator even provided the commission with details of the exact dates of the infringement.</p>
<p>The wagers in question were placed on basketball games featuring Harvard University. Since Massachusetts punters cannot legally bet on smaller in-state collegiate events, both bets violated the law. This happened because the university was incorrectly marked as an out-of-state institution, investigators found out.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield Will Be More Careful</p>
<p>Since the incident, BetMGM, which operates MGM Springfield, vowed to be more mindful. The operator announced that it has “reviewed and verified that all Massachusetts collegiate sports are properly restricted.”</p>
<p>In addition, the gambling company confirmed that it will start a daily audit of all of the available wagers. This, it said, will help it avoid bets on blacklisted events.</p>
<p>The matter will be further discussed on April 14 when the regulator will convene to discuss the illegal bets and decide whether punitive action is needed. The gathering was announced on the Massachusetts Gaming Commission’s official website.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission will convene an adjudicatory hearing relative to the alleged noncompliance of MGM Springfield with G.L. c. 23N, § 3; 205 CMR 247.01(2)(a)(2); and the Massachusetts Sports Wagering Catalogue. MGC announcement</p>
<p>The MGC Will Address Encore’s Violations as Well</p>
<p>In addition to discussing MGM Springfield, the regulator will also discuss other illegal wagers that were recorded in Encore Boston Harbor. A bug in the system allowed customers to place bets on a Boston College women’s basketball game.</p>
<p>Fewer details have been officially released about this case. However, it is not the first time illegal wagers have been recorded at the property. As a result, the MGC will decide whether to penalize the operator.</p>
<p>As announced by the MGC, it will discuss the MGM matter from 1:30 pm and will continue by addressing the Encore case from 3:00 pm.</p>
