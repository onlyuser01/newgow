    <h1>Harrah S Gulf Coast Casino Seminole Casino Login Hotels Near Foxwoods Casino Ct Casinos Minnesota Ca</h1>

<p>Hello Janette.</p>
<p>We created a fair gambling codex where we also mention a situation like yours:</p>
<p>Please check: https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>For 100% we agree that players from restricted countries should be blocked.</p>
<p>If blocking fails:</p>
<p>We believe that if casino (accidentally) take a player from the restricted country, it should treat the player as from allowed country.</p>
<p>In your case, it means that you have no right for a refund because you lost your money fairly. (if you bet and loss)</p>
<p>Because you mentioned other cases, we decided to investigate them.</p>
<p>In the case of player Gjc1980:</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>WINOUI CASINO took over £3000 out of my bank and refused to pay me over £8000 pounds because i was registered in the UK. They even refused to pay me back my deposits even though they verified my account beforehand knowing i was from the UK. I have lots of photo and video evidence that i was still allowed to gamble ad deposit more money onto the site well after i was verified. sent me a load of terms and conditions jargon that i had broken bonus rules and procedures.</p>
<p>It indicates that the player was accused of breaching bonus T&amp;C's not restricted country problem.</p>
<p>Player markylastic is complaining about the same issue as you.</p>
<p>He is afraid that he had zero chance of winning, but there is no evidence that the casino didn't pay him.</p>
<p>Player Joel1212: looks like he also lost the money and then want a refund. (same as you)</p>
<p>Player Queenie Mark she confirmed that she won and received the winnings (which proves all that casino said about paying the winnings)</p>
<p>Player CharlesWIN: not sure what is this player complaining about - it looks like for French players was website unavailable for some time. (or completely different type of problem)</p>
<p>We also run a deep search where we checked the complaints and reputation on WinOui casino at a similar website as ours.</p>
<p>We didn't find any complaint's, which indicates that somebody has a problem with this casino. (except LCB)</p>
<p>Because of all these reasons we believe that your complaint is unjustified.</p>
<p>You can submit the complaint to UK regulator - UKGC, but I do not believe that such action results of the refund.</p>
