    <h1>Wind Creek Online Casino Desert Nights Casino Casino In Indio Ca South Point Casino And Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>I would like to know CasinoGuru's opinion on this case with reference to fair gaming.</p>
<p>I suffer from extreme gambling addiction and have therefore been in therapy for more than a year. I usually don't manage to gamble for months. A few times a year, however, I have no will left and gamble. However, the gambling addiction and the losses are kept within limits.</p>
<p>That's why I got myself banned from a lot of casinos and casino groups months ago. This was also the case in the casinos of Altacore N.V. (Dokumente vorhanden). Unfortunately, I lost the fight against my gambling addiction in the short term and gambled away over 3000 EURO in the casinozer casino, which belongs to the Altacore N.V. casino group. I was able to register at this casino, deposit money and gamble away, although I have been banned from all other casinos of the group without exception for a long time because of gambling addiction (documents available). Only at one casino of the group (casinozer) was I able to register and deposit money and gamble. I assume that it is an internal technical error that I was not also blocked at casinozer.</p>
<p>An employee (livechat) of casinozer told me the following in livechat:</p>
<p>April 9 (3:18): "if you are blacklisted, you cannot open an account at partner casinos."</p>
<p>April 9 (3: 20): "I did not understand your request, it is normal that you are not allowed to play on partner casinos, if you have been banned and blacklisted from one of the casinos."</p>
<p>The way I read it, a casinozer employee himself admitted that I shouldn't have been allowed to play at casinozer's casino either if I was blocked at other partner casinos. So I'm assuming that it's an internal system error, that I was able to register on casinozer and that the complainant can't do anything about the failure of this player protection function.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, casinozer does not have any player protection functions and no proper complaints procedure, because complaints are always answered with the same reasoning (regardless of the content of the complaint):</p>
<p>"2.6. By creating your account, you guarantee the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You understand and accept the existing risks of losing your money by using the services of the Website. according to our T&amp;C that you have accepted, this is the reason why we will not be able to refund your deposits. We will respond to any legal action against us"</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is impossible to file a complaint that will be resolved competently and individually. I look forward to CasinoGuru's opinion on this case. Especially with reference to the two statements made by the casinozer employee in live chat.</p>
<p>I accept that you must and should lock yourself out at each individual casino and that cross-casino account bans are not mandatory. However, I believe that the statements made by the casinozer employee make it clear that there is an internal error in the system, and I request appropriate self-criticism and empathy from casinozer so that they realize that there was a failure and that I was able to play in casinozer , although I was blocked in every single partner casino and according to casinozer himself, I would have to be blocked in all other casinos as well. It is important that players can trust statements that are made.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable work! ðŸ™‚</p>
