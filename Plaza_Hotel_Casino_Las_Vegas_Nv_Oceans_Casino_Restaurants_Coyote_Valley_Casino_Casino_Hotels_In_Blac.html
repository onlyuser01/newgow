<p>I want some information from Bodog, to be answered by the agent of team Bodog:</p>
<p>1) What is Bodog's license data? Where are they licensed and which regulator (s) of the license in terms of complaints disputes for players who need to report against the company?</p>
<p>2) What are the legal details of the Bodog company, for those who want to legally sue them, directly and personally, in the company's headquarters country, data from the legal sector and the company's lawyer?</p>
<p>3) Where is my money that I earned by playing honestly, my profit of 607.40? Where did he end up? Who was it for? What is the destination, if they blocked my account without reason and did not send it to me?</p>
<p>I WAIT ANSWER, TODAY, ABOUT THESE 3 QUESTIONS ABOVE</p>
