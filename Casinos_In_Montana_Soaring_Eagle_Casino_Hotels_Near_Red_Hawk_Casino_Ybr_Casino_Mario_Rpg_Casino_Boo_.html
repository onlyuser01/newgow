    <h1>Casinos In Montana Soaring Eagle Casino Hotels Near Red Hawk Casino Ybr Casino Mario Rpg Casino Boo</h1>

<p>Hello ...my name is David ****...recently I have been actually depositing from my bank account because for the last couple years Ive been trying to win through bonus spins and free spins thinking thats the way to go. Well after winning a few times and losing a few times because i really didn't read or was interested in the terms and conditions of a bonus. In fact the way I play now is because i thought I won over 800 and some odd dollars from a different casino after i played through the bonus wager and that playthrough took me hours and hours to finish. Well i tried withdrawing from that casino...(which was a couple years ago)...they said I went over the max bet allowed..which at that time it was 2.50 $ max. As angry as I was cause i thought i won...i could not say that I didn't bet over the limit. Since that time I have my own personal rule of any game i play. I never bet over one dollar. So I took the bonus of 100 spins in royal coins 2 of a 5$dep...the wager was 30Ã—...in my bonus spins I balanced out at 59 dollars and change...the rules for any spin in this bonus was the lesser of the 2..either 4.00 $max bet per spin...or 10 percent max of the winnings of those bonus spins. Which would be 5$ and change. So where does it say if my maximum bet of only 1dollar max during my whole time spinning in any game I played during my time in this casino...BOO CASINO...will it say i bet over the max bet per spin...even when I asked the live chat operator how much i am able to cash out said..looks like you did well mr novack just send documents and if there was a problem support will contact you...I got the mail from support saying i went over the maximum bet per spin. Well I lost it...there is no way the maximum spin is over .99 cents. I want everyone to know. I have been cheated out of my winnings from a greedy casino that can't even pay the tiny amout that I DID WIN FAIR AND SQUARE WITH THEIR OWN RULES. They should be ashamed of ripping off the little man that just wants to have fun. How many more advantage takers are out there. BOO CASINO IS NOT A CASINO OF HONESTY.</p>
