<p>The leading provider and distributor of iGaming content, 3 Oaks Gaming, announced Thursday the release of a new slot game. Expanding its portfolio further, the iGaming provider confirmed the launch of Black Wolf 2: Hold and Win, a sequel to its popular Black Wolf: Hold and Win title that has proven its popularity across the globe.</p>
<p>The latest slot from 3 Oaks Gaming invites the players back to the picturesque wildlands and brings rewarding and engaging features. The 5x4 slot game features 25 paylines and incorporates symbols of wild cats and wolves, among other majestic wildlife creatures that can be found in the woods.</p>
<p>Lauded as a feature-rich game, Black Wolf 2: Hold and Win brings Wilds as well as a Boost feature. As the name suggests, the slot game leverages the famous Hold and Win Bonus game, delivering further engaging experiences. Additionally, 3 Oaks Gaming's latest slot grants a chance for significant payouts with its Grand Jackpot feature.</p>
<p>Sebastian Damian, 3 Oaks Gaming's Managing Director, shared his excitement about the newly released slot game. In a statement, he pointed out: "Black Wolf proved a real success for us when it was originally released at the end of 2021 so players should be excited with the launch of this latest version, with upgraded features and unrivaled gameplay."</p>
<p>Finally, Damian outlined: "Whenever we create a sequel to a popular original, we look at ways to subtly boost features and the Fortune Slide mechanic is always a hit, bolstering the player journey and we are confident that this slot will take the market by storm."</p>
<p>Players of Black Wolf 2: Hold and Win can benefit from the game's Boost Symbol, presented as a Fiery Ball. Whenever they land such as symbol, they can collect the values of all Full Moon Bonus Symbols present, beefing up their winnings significantly.</p>
<p>What's more, lucky players that land the Boost Symbol along with the Mystery Symbol, presented as Purple Moon, transform it to a high-value Bonus Symbol or have a chance for a Jackpot Symbol that can be Mini, Minor or Major.</p>
<p>Elevating the excitement further, 3 Oaks Gaming's slot game brings Free Spin rounds as well. Once this game mode is activated, the players can benefit from eight Free Spins. Just like in other engaging slot games, Black Wolf 2: Hold and Win enables the players to retrigger the Free Spins feature.</p>
