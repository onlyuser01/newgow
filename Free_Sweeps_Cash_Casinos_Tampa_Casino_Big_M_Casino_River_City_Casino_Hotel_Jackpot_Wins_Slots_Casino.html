<p>BF Games’ plan for 2023 is to continue exploring key markets across Europe and the Americas</p>
<p>BF Games, a developer of dynamic casino games, has expanded its presence in Belgium thanks to an agreement with PepperMill Casino. The supplier will power the operator with a range of dice games, just as agreed.</p>
<p>Under the deal, 10 of BG Games’ dice titles will become available to PepperMill Casino’s customers in Belgium. The games in question will include some of the provider’s finest, including Ancient Secrets Dice, Energy Fruits Dice, Magic Queens Dice, Pyramid Treasure Dice and Royal Crown Dice.</p>
<p>As a major name in Belgian gaming, PepperMill seeks to always improve and expand its portfolio of dice games and table games. The company operates retail and online gambling in Belgium and the Netherlands and is very experienced with local audiences.</p>
<p>The agreement will, therefore, benefit BG Games, which is constantly looking to explore new markets and expand its footprint in existing ones. The company recently secured a license in the Canadian province of Ontario, further expanding its global reach. Around the same time, it also launched games in Greece with Novibet.</p>
<p>BF Games Targets Expansion</p>
<p>BF Games’ plan for 2023 is to continue exploring key markets across Europe and the Americas. Claudia Melcaru, the developer’s head of business development, commented on the launch with PepperMill Casino, saying that it attests to the appeal of BG Games’ dice titles. She also noted that Belgium is a key market for her company’s commercial growth.</p>
<p>It’s a thrilling time for BF Games as we maintain strong momentum from both an expansion and product point of view and this partnership with a leading operator further underlines our success. Claudia Melcaru, head of business development, BF Games</p>
<p>PepperMill Casino’s casino manager, Jorn Stifter, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He noted that his company is delighted to add BG Games’ titles to his company’s library, further strengthening the PepperMill product portfolio. Stifter praised BF Games for its engaging and varied content that is sure to appeal to Belgian players.</p>
<p>Their content offers a wide variety of themes and features that will appeal to our customers so we look forward to a successful partnership. Jorn Stifter, casino manager, PepperMill Casino</p>
<p>In March, PepperMill Casino helped another B2B company expand in Belgium, namely Stakelogic. Two months earlier, the operator also formed a Belgium-facing partnership with CT Interactive.</p>
