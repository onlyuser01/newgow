<p>Bournemouth are welcoming Aston Villa on Saturday, August 6 at Vitality Stadium. They’re back in the Premier League and are determined to stay there, which is why you can expect them to give their maximum against Villa. The trouble is that Aston Villa’s players just look much better than those playing for Bournemouth, hence why the Villans are favorites on Saturday.</p>

<p>Bournemouth are Back in the Prem</p>
<p>After finishing second in the championship last season, Bournemouth got themselves an express ride to the English top-flight. They’re back in the Premier League after two seasons and are determined to stay there for a while.</p>
<p>That’s their dream, but the reality is different – Bournemouth is seen as the strongest favorite for relegation in the 2022-23 season with the odds of just -250.</p>
<p>The thing is that even though they do have a couple of decent players on the roster, they just aren’t good enough to expect good things in the Prem. Plus, the club doesn’t have the finances to sign quality players that would fill in all the gaps that need fixing.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn’t mean they’re going to raise a white flag from day 1. On the contrary, it’s almost certain they’re going to be in the fight mode at the start of the 2022-23 Premier League season. What this means is that Aston Villa are going to have a very difficult task on their hands this coming Saturday.</p>
<p>Aston Villa Dreaming Big</p>
<p>The player quality in Saturday’s game is definitely on the side of Aston Villa. In fact, Villa’s roster looks fantastic at the moment, with at least two amazing players for literally every position on the pitch. Last season, they finished in the #15 place, but this time, we expect much more from the Villans.</p>
<p>Their ambitions are very high, as evident from the fact that they spent more than $50 million on transfers this summer. Most of that money went for the capture of Diego Carlos, a defender who played for Sevilla last season. The second-highest transfer fee the Villans paid this offseason was for Philippe Coutinho, who played for Arsenal last six months on a loan deal with Barcelona.</p>
<p>Bournemouth vs Aston Villa Prediction</p>
<p>Aston Villa look like a possible dark horse of the 2022-23 season. They got a terrific squad, with players that seem to deserve to compete in continental competitions (e.g., UEFA Europa League).</p>
<p>If they’re going to challenge for a finish in the top portion of the EPL table, they need to start the season in top gear. And that means that winning against Bournemouth is a must!</p>
<p>Picks: Aston Villa to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
