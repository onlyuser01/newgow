<p>Napoli is the only Serie A team that’s still without a single loss in the 2022-23 season. Will that change on January 4, when the Sky Blues are taking on the reigning champions, Inter Milan?</p>
<p>The 2022-23 season of the Italian Serie A returns on January 4, 2023, with Round 16. There are 10 games on the program, the most interesting of which is Inter Milan vs Napoli.</p>
<p>The no. 1 reason why this is such an interesting matchup is that it’s a clash between the reigning champ (Inter Milan) and the current Serie A table leader (Napoli).</p>
<p>Further, the duels between these two are always fun to watch, and this one could be especially interesting. The thing is that Napoli is without a single win over Inter Milan in Serie A in six games.</p>

<p>World Cup Break Has Worked Great for Inter Milan</p>
<p>After a slow start to the 2022-23 season, Inter Milan entered a good run just before the World Cup break. Il Nerazzurri went 6-1 before the break, which moved them all the way up to the no. 5 place in the Serie A standings.</p>
<p>Sure, that’s still way too low by Inter’s standards, but these guys do have a decent chance to climb even higher. They might be 11 points behind Napoli, but they’re just three points behind second-placed AC Milan.</p>
<p>Knowing that they have a chance to move up as many as three spots with a win on January 4 means that they won’t lack any motivation. But do they have the manpower to beat Napoli? Well, all of their key men are fit and ready for the clash, which wasn’t the case before the World Cup break.</p>
<p>Can Napoli Pick Up Where They Left?</p>
<p>Napoli are 13-2-0 this season, which makes the Sky Blues the only Serie A team that’s still without a single loss. The most impressive fact is that they got all wins in Serie A since August.</p>
<p>Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia are Napoli’s key men this season, who have 15 goals and seven assists in Serie A between them in the 2022-23 season. Mostly thanks to those two is Napoli the highest-scoring team in the Italian top-flight with 37 goals in 15 matches.</p>
<p>This team’s also been decent at the back. Actually, with just 12 goals conceded so far, the Sky Blues have the third-best defense in the league.</p>
<p>Inter Milan vs Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Milan’s home venue is Italy’s biggest stadium San Siro, which explains why this team is incredibly hard to beat on home turf. Napoli’s done it only twice since the 1990s. We don’t think Napoli will add a third away win to the list. Instead, we think the most likely outcome of this game is a home win.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Milan to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
