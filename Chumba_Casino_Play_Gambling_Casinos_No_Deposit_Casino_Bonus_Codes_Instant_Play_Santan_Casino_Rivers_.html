<p>For its first foray outside Nevada, SuperBook has chosen Colorado with the sportsbook bringing its expertise to a state that will begin allowing sports betting and mobile registration as early as May 1, 2020.</p>
<p>SuperBook to Join Colorado’s Sports Betting Landscape</p>
<p>Colorado’s sports betting market is about to get more exciting with Jacobs Entertainment, Inc. teaming up with SuperBook to set-up shop for the sportsbook at The Lodge Casino in Black Hawk.</p>
<p>The development comes shortly after Colorado announced that it is planning to finalize its sports betting framework despite the coronavirus lockdown that has suspended most professional sports.</p>
<p>SuperBook is an experienced bookmaker running a retail facility at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino and a mobile betting app in Nevada. The brand will bring its experience in Colorado offering both retail as well as mobile wagering. In Nevada, the company generates around 68% of its revenue via mobile.</p>

<p>While the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission is yet to issue a permit to the brand, SuperBook has teamed up with The Lodge Casino to make its offer available to sports fans in the state. The Commission will debate tomorrow, Thursday, April 16 and discuss several license approvals and renewals.</p>
<p>This is an important milestone for SuperBook which is venturing outside Nevada for the first time after close to twenty years of running betting markets in the Silver State.</p>
<p>In light of this development, Westgate Las Vegas Vice President of Race and Sports Operations Jay Kornegay explained that Super Book is targeting states where the company expects to drive strong revenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Kornegay ruled out the possibility of the company targeting all states where sports betting has been approved. He further noted that the chosen location made a perfect fit for the company’s first expansion move outside Las Vegas:</p>
<p>“We believe The Lodge is a perfect fit for our initial expansion opportunities outside Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kornegay didn’t miss to note that things had got a little “tripped up” but SuperBook was now back on track.</p>
<p>Colorado Sports Betting Expected Early May</p>
<p>Colorado should roll out a finalized sports betting framework on May 1, enabling a total of 33 casinos across three towns, to name Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek, to host betting contests.</p>
<p>All casinos are allowed to partner with any out-of-state operator they see fit, although all such partnerships are subject to approval by the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enabling mobile registration and betting is expected to drive strong revenue. In other states where mobile betting is legal, including New Jersey, Indiana and Pennsylvania mobile accounts for over 70% of the total sports handle and the numbers are growing.</p>
<p>SuperBook will also add SuperContest to the range of offers in Colorado. In SuperContest, asks a participation fee of $1,500 in Nevada and asks punters to place handicap bets on pro football. The fee is expected to be $500 in Colorado if the state commission approves it.</p>
