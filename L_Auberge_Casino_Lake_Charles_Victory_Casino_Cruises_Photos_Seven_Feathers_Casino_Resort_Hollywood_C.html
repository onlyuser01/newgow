<p>Both the LA Chargers and the Cleveland Browns seem to be overachieving since the start of the 2021 season. Both are 3-1 ahead of Week 5, with some really impressive wins so far.</p>
<p>The Chargers, for example, managed to beat the #1 Super Bowl favorites, the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 3. They also beat the Las Vegas Raiders last weekend, a team that was 3-0 before that game</p>
<p>They’re expected to continue their winning streak with a win over the Browns. The team from Ohio hasn’t been as impressive as the Chargers, but they’ve been getting the job done.</p>
<p>All of this means that we’re in for a really exciting game on Sunday night.</p>

<p>The Browns Need to Do Better in the Offense</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Browns beat the Minnesota Vikings but the win was far from comfortable. The final score was 14-7, with an early lead by the Vikings. It took the Browns 53 minutes to score their first points of the game.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they somehow managed to get a win, but their offensive performances need to worry their head coach Kevin Stefanski.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s quarterback Baker Mayfield had a horrible game, with no touchdown passes. He went 15/33 for 155 yards, which was one of his worst performances in a while.</p>
<p>Their offense wasn’t good, but their defense was fabulous. In fact, the Browns defense has been terrific this entire season, conceding just 67 points so far. The best thing is that in their previous two games, they allowed just 13 points.</p>
<p>That’s something that really needs to worry the Chargers ahead of Sunday’s duel.</p>
<p>Will Justin Herbert Continue to Dominate?</p>
<p>This team has scored 95 points so far, which is five points fewer than the Browns. However, the Chargers faced some really tough opponents in the four previous games – WFT, Cowboys, Chiefs, and Raiders.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we saw them beating the Las Vegas team 28-14. The Chargers’ second-year quarterback was superb with 66% pass completion for three touchdowns.</p>
<p>What’s even more impressive is that Herbert looked really comfortable in tense moments of the game, suggesting that he could be their game-winner this season.</p>
<p>Apart from having a fantastic offense, the Chargers’ defense has also been one of the league’s best. That said, this team definitely looks capable of grabbing a win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not going to be easy but they should be able to cover the spread. After all, if they’re going to win, they’re going to do it with at least a field goal difference.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Chargers to win and cover the spread. As a result, the over should hit.</p>
