<p>Hacksaw Gaming has much to be excited about as one of the world’s leading developers of online casino games has now been granted a full supplier license to enter the West Virginian iGaming market - and it has already secured a first operator partner in the jurisdiction. This comes almost a year after the provisional license was granted to the company in November 2022.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is now going to work with Rush Street Interactive, Inc as the company is officially rolling out its products in the state, with Rush Street hailed as of the fastest-growing online casino and betting operators. Thanks to this new partnership, Hacksaw Gaming’s titles will be integrated into BetRivers’ content offer through Light &amp; Wonder’s platform. Hacksaw Gaming CCO Gabrielle Star welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>"Today’s news represents a huge milestone for us. We’re overjoyed to make our long-awaited US bow with RSI’s BetRivers, one of the leading casino brands in the states, capping months of hard work behind the scenes."</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz was similarly pleased with the news and excited at the opportunity, adding that the company was very happy to see this launch happen in West Virginia. He welcomed the chance to add more of Hacksaw Gaming’s new and popular casino games, and further strengthen the BetRivers’ brand positioning in the market and region.</p>
<p>The latest license and market launch adds to a long list of successful arrangements with local regulators in Ontario, Canada, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Malta, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands, and Malta, as Hacksaw continues to expand globally and bring its acclaimed titles, such as Gladiator Legends, Hand of Anubis and Wanted Dead or a Wild across different jurisdictions. All of the games in the Hacksaw Gaming portfolio are built as a mix of themes and concepts.</p>
<p>When the full supplier license was granted earlier this month, Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming CEO, welcomed the opportunity to see his brand enter yet another important market. This is de facto the first time that Hacksaw has been able to expand in the United States, following very successful rollouts across Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>He hailed the jurisdiction as a country with a rich gaming heritage and also spoke of the efforts that Hacksaw Gaming’s team had put in to make this a reality, adding:</p>
<p>"It’s a reflection of the team’s ambition and hard work that we’re finally approved to deliver our award-winning content to players in the States, and we’re in no doubt they will love what we have to offer."</p>
<p>Cordes was confident that entry into West Virginia was the right move for the company as well, citing the state’s recent steady growth in iGaming. Through this new entry, Hacksaw Gaming is perfectly positioned to continue with its international growth, Cordes added.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has worked with Rush Street Interactive before. The supplier and Betrivers teamed up in Ontario, introducing the developer’s excellent games to local audiences.</p>
<p>Hacksaw is determined to continue expanding with its first entry into West Virginia hardly going to be its last, as the company is most likely going to expand to other iGaming jurisdictions in the United States, including New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, among others.</p>
