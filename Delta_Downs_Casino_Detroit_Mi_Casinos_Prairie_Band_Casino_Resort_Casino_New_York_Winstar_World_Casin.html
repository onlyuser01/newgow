    <h1>Delta Downs Casino Detroit Mi Casinos Prairie Band Casino Resort Casino New York Winstar World Casin</h1>

<p>I have checked general terms and conditions and this is what I found https://www.lordlucky.de/de/bonus:</p>
<p>"Before you use your welcome bonus, we ask you to read the bonus conditions carefully:</p>
<p>This bonus can be claimed once per customer, household, IP address, email address or telephone number."</p>
<p>Additionally, in the general rules, I have found this https://www.lordlucky.de/de/allgemeine-geschaeftsbedingungen:</p>
<p>"In order to play for real money on the website, you must register a player account (hereinafter referred to as "player account") on the website and deposit funds into your player account. The registration of a player account must be carried out by the account holder. You are only allowed to have one account on this website. If you have more than one account, you must inform us immediately. Also, only one account is allowed for each IP / household. If you open more than one account, all winnings on either account will be forfeited and all accounts may be closed. We reserve the right to take further action if necessary. If we leave your first account open, initial deposits that remain in other accounts as balances (the "duplicate account"), Added to your first account. If we discover that more than one account is registered for your household, we reserve the right to suspend or close some or all accounts for that household. All transactions made from the duplicate account will be void."</p>
<p>Please understand that these rules have been breached and I'm afraid that we're not in a position to help you. Let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint at this time. I really wish I were of more help. Thank you.</p>
