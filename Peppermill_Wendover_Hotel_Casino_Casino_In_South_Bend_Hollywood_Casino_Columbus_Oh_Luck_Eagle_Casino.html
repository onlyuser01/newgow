    <h1>Peppermill Wendover Hotel Casino Casino In South Bend Hollywood Casino Columbus Oh Luck Eagle Casino</h1>

<p>Livespins, the world’s biggest iGaming innovator when it comes to the way audiences consume and enjoy slots, has added another studio partner to its offer to strengthen the overall portfolio and provide players and partner operators with yet more worthwhile content and experiences, Casno Guru News learned in a press release shared via email.</p>
<p>The company makes it possible for viewers to watch their favorite casino streamers play slot games and place bets alongside them. The bet sizes are placed at thediscretion of the viewer, and there is no obligation to place a certain bet or amount whatsoever.</p>
<p>The addition of Golden Rock content will allow Livespins’ streamers to expand the library of games they can stream to casino and slot fans, with games such as Remember Remember, BonusOnly and Big Bad Beasts, some of the company’s best-established products.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new addition to its library, Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen said that Golden Rock’s games have established themselves as fun and worthwhile, and they make for a great streaming experience.</p>
<p>"This is a great partnership for Golden Rock as it can get its games live with more operators than ever before and put these games in front of those lucrative but hard-to-reach Millennial and Generation Z audiences," Pedersen explained.</p>
<p>The executive was also confident that Golden Rock too stands to benefit from Livespins unique offer and help boost the supplier’s footprint and reach. Golden Rock Head of Sales and Marketing Gary Francis welcomed the opportunity and said that the product that Livespins had crafted was simply "insane."</p>
<p>It’s one of the most important partnerships that Golden Rock has signed in its company’s history, Francis added, confident that the two companies will work together to deliver even more worthwhile experiences to audiences.</p>
<p>Livespins has been actively building up its portfolio of titles and offers available to its audiences and partner operators. To this end, the company has been keen to keep adding fresh partnerships with suppliers, allowing itself to secure content from S-tier companies continuously.</p>
<p>Comtrade, another supplier, joined Livespins’ partner list earlier in August. This is not the only partnership that Livespins signed this month, with Caleta Gaming also joining at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>Livespins’ product offer has become so popular that it now sits as its own product vertical in casino lobbies, giving itself and its partner suppliers further prominence with audiences.</p>
