<p>The partnership between leading sports betting and iGaming operator BetMGM and Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos in Arizona saw the opening of the first of three retail sportsbooks, at Vee Quiva, BetMGM announced.</p>
<p>First Retail Sports Betting Location</p>
<p>The opening of the first BetMGM retail sportsbook at Vee Quiva in Arizona happened less than two months after the partnership had launched the operator’s industry-leading digital sports betting platform in the state to make it the 15th US jurisdiction to feature BetMGM mobile and online products.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt emphasized the importance of the partnership with Gila River that had started to come to fruition and would continue to deliver the goods, providing two additional venues at Wild Horse Pass and Lone Butte, which, like the BetMGM Sportsbook at Vee Quiva, would become “true destination[s] for sports fans.”</p>
<p>BetMGM and Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos announced a three-way deal in August, together with the Arizona Cardinals of the NFL, under which the parties agreed to launch mobile and retail sports betting in the state, with 3 retail locations at Gila River Indian Community tribal land and one at the Cardinals’ State Farm Stadium.</p>
<p>“The new sportsbooks align perfectly with Gila River’s sports-centric brand. As Arizona’s Official Sports Headquarters, we take pride in bringing unique sports experiences to our valued guests.” Kenneth Manuel, CEO, Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos</p>
<p>Since then, BetMGM and Gila River have been collaborating to build the custom retail sportsbooks at Vee Quiva, Wild Horse Pass and Lone Butte. While the first one is now open, the parties continue working on the remaining two, targeting openings in the near-distant future. The retail sports betting location at the Cardinals’ home field is slated to open in time for the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with BetMGM to deliver a diverse, engaging selection of betting options, no matter if you’re a huge sports fan or just want to check out the fun.” Kenneth Manuel, CEO, Gila River Hotels &amp; Casinos</p>
<p>Magnet for Sports Fans and Bettors</p>
<p>The newly-opened BetMGM Sportsbook at Vee Quiva is offering a seating capacity enough to accommodate more than 100 guests and is featuring a massive media wall and 25 large screen displays, allowing guests to view games from all major US leagues and international sporting events. 20 betting kiosks are at bettors’ disposal when they decide to place bets, while ticket writers are present to assist with their wagering.</p>
<p>“These retail sportsbooks complement our existing mobile platform in Arizona and further cement our goal of providing BetMGM customers with a world-class experience,” concluded BetMGM CEO Greenblatt.</p>
