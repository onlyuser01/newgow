    <h1>Hotel Paris Casino Tampa Casino Hotel Vegas Strip Casino Santa Fe Station Hotel And Casino Free Spin</h1>

<p>Some of my 2k winnings have been paid out in part: 1500€ were paid out and 500€ were not.</p>
<p>My account was suspended without any proof, merely with the claim that I'm a fraud and a scammer.</p>
<p>I received no solid proof, they checked my gameplay history and are of the opinion that I am cheating!</p>
<p>How am I supposed to have cheated?</p>
<p>I didn't change my bets during a game. I switched games, but I didn't do anything wrong or anything that could manipulate a game. I don't even know how that works!</p>
<p>I politely ask Slottica to provide an answer with proof, and dear Guru team, please help me clear this up.</p>
