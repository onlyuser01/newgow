    <h1>Slot Machine Free Slots Casino Fitz Casino Tunica Fire Kirin Casino Fishing Casino Slot Machine Game</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru team,</p>
<p>I unfortunately need your much appreciated help with this house.</p>
<p>When I registered there about 2 months ago, the casino still had a decent rating on your website, but it has now dropped significantly. I am registered at many casinos and I would also say that I know the "normal" rules that apply.</p>
<p>Now to my case:</p>
<p>Most of the casino's bonuses have wagering requirements of x35, x15 and there are also some with "wager free" where the deposited amount only needs to be wagered and where you can withdraw the free spins winnings afterwards.</p>
<p>I used both these free spins and the x15 wagering bonuses.</p>
<p>All current promotions are - as usual - very aggressively displayed by the casino on the bonus page and the deposit link and no limitations are indicated.</p>
<p>I never had any problems with deposits and withdrawals and then won almost 200 euros on one of the slots. When I wanted to withdraw them, the casino refused, saying that I had made deposits several times and used bonuses and that you had to make deposits in between without claiming a bonus. So it is not possible to deposit, meet the bonus conditions and then withdraw. I find this very strange and unfortunately, according to the reviews, I'm not the only one with problems. In my opinion, this regulation only exists to freeze funds, because nobody expects that you can't use a bonus if it is displayed and you meet the conditions.</p>
<p>I didn't get a reply to my last 2 emails.</p>
<p>What I find VERY unfair is the following:</p>
<p>I only know of a regulation that prevents the number of deposits with a bonus in this casino. According to our national law and that of many other countries, such a clause would be "surprising" and therefore ineffective if it only appears in general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The casino would have the technical ability to prevent further deposits with bonuses if you deposited 3-4x with a bonus, but they don't do this.</p>
<p>The casino could pay me the winnings and simply deduct the bonus amount that was generated from the free spins (10 euros), instead the deposit and winnings are simply paid in.</p>
<p>I really hope that you can mediate between me and the casino and make an arbitration award. I would also greatly appreciate it if you could clearly point out that there is this clause in the T&amp;Cs and that the casino applies it restrictively.</p>
<p>I am enclosing the e-mails from the casino with reasons and the rejected payout.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help. If the casino refuses to come to an agreement, I would try to get a refund of the deposited amounts for the disputed amount via the payment provider / credit card provider. As far as I read your great website correctly, it makes no sense to complain to the supervisory authority in Curacao, does it?</p>
