    <h1>Council Bluffs Iowa Casinos Seminole Immokalee Casino Casinos In Utah Firefox Casino Tropicana Casin</h1>

<p>Betting and gaming platform theScore Bet will clip its wings in the United States and turn the lights off in the next few months. The operator will begin officially making its exit from the market on June 15 from all four states where it currently operates and will double down its efforts in its home market in Canada. The withdrawal will be in phases. The first one starting this June is for the company to stop accepting any new bets.</p>
<p>Bettors to Have Sufficient Time to Withdraw Their Balances</p>
<p>With Ontario opening up to private operators on April 1, 2022 theScore feels that its operations in Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, and Colorado are no longer worth the effort. US customers will be able to continue making withdrawals through July 1 when all wagering operations will stop.</p>
<p>The most recent decision to withdraw may be due to over-saturation, poor performance, or a strategic long-term decision to cover as many markets as possible. theScore is owned by Penn National Gaming, which already operates Barstool Sportsbook in the United States. As such, Barstool is present in 12 states, including those covered by theScore, calling the question of redundancies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, expanding in Canada proves to be an important long-term decision. All events graded and settled prior to July 1 will be honored. This means that the NBA and NHL playoffs will be covered and not suffer a premature withdrawal. However, the operator does recommend consumers start to actively withdraw their funds and complete the process prior to July 1.</p>
<p>theScore Bet will then follow up by taking matters into its own hands and using ACH transfers and mail checks to get the remaining balances back to customers. However, consumers who have an outdated address would need to get in touch with theScore Bet in its final month of operation and clarify this matter with customer support.</p>
<p>Technological Integration between theScore and Barstool to Continue</p>
<p>theScore President and COO Benjie Levy has shed some clarity on the matter and said that Barstool’s plan has always been to cover both North American markets and ensure that it has one flagship brand to lead each. theScore Bet has made significant efforts in elevating its profile in Ontario and Canada as a whole. Levy’s statement read:</p>
<p>“With theScore Bet launched and thriving in Ontario, and as we approach a major undertaking this summer with the launch of our proprietary risk and trading service, the timing is right to focus our US efforts on marketing Barstool Sportsbook and our Canadian efforts on marketing theScore Bet.” theScore President and COO Benjie Levy</p>
<p>Meanwhile, theScore Bet is also preparing to help Barstool to transition to its own in-house betting platform which should improve the synergies between the two companies and boost their technological integration. TheScore’s account management and trading platforms are provenly effective and Barstool should be making the switch by the end of 2023. Levy is confident that this would strengthen the brand’s overall reach and position in the US market.</p>
