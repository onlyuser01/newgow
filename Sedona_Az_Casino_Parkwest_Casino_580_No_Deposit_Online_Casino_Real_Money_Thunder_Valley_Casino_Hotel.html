    <h1>Sedona Az Casino Parkwest Casino 580 No Deposit Online Casino Real Money Thunder Valley Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>Sportradar has been reinstated as Kambi Group’s exclusive supplier of National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, and Major League Baseball data. According to the five-year partnership extension both companies agreed upon, they will continue their long and fruitful collaboration while working on reaching the next level in data delivery and catering to the absolute benefit of their mutual customers.</p>
<p>Sportradar is an international leader in online content and sports data leverage, while Kambi Group is the biggest business-to-business sports betting platform provider offering state-of-the-art sports betting technology. The two companies had started a partnership in 2018 when the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was revoked.</p>
<p>Sportradar Will Keep Providing Kambi with Essential Data</p>
<p>The deal also named Sportradar as the only college sports data supplier to be used by Kambi in the US market. Sportradar will provide it with pre-match score data that will, in turn, become available to all Kambi’s American partners. The list of partners included TwinSpires, Churchill Downs Incorporated, Rush Street Interactive’s BetRivers, and Penn National Gaming’ Barstool Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Another important part of the deal concerns Sportradar’s obligation to supply Kambi Group with its live score data and a variety of content solutions such as Live Match Trackers that will be used for major sports in the country.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why the partnership between Sportradar and Kambi has been such a lucrative one in the past three years is related to the fact that both companies were ready to rumble when the American market was officially opened back in 2018. All they had to do was start working together in a close and diligent manner and come up with clever ways to reach and hold on to their positions as market leaders in the long run.</p>
<p>Plans for a “Fantastic Platform”</p>
<p>Kambi has vowed its unfaltering allegiance to Sportradar for the upcoming years. Jack McKittrick, the Group’s vice president responsible for commercial operations, commented on the need to offer their partners’ customers top-notch sports wagering experiences. This asks for a detailed integration of quick, top-quality data. The extension is just what the two partners need to create a “fantastic platform” that would allow them to keep delivering their excellent services.</p>
<p>The extension decision comes after Sportradar recently agreed to partner up with PointsBet, an online gambling operator. Sportradar has turned into PointsBet’s American provider of choice for MLB, NBA, NHL, as well as college basketball and football data. Kambi has also signed a deal with the Desert Diamond Casinos &amp; Entertainment, agreeing to launch a dedicated on-site sportsbook while expanding the Group’s business in Arizona.</p>
