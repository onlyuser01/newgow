<p>OlyBet’s CEO is very excited about the agreement, saying that it will help his team provide players with many more interactive experiences</p>
<p>The DP Tour, a European men’s professional golf league, has designated OlyBet as its official betting operator in the Old Continent. The agreement between the two parties has been signed for two years and will cover all European countries with the exception of the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement, OlyBet, an Estonia-headquartered casino and sports betting company, will be able to provide its sports betting customers with the freshest information regarding the DP Tour.</p>
<p>Relevant DP Tour information will be available at OlyBet’s sportsbooks and casinos, while its online streaming platform, OlyBet YV, will broadcast content from the tour. As announced, the operator will follow 39 DP Tour tournaments this season alone.</p>
<p>New Fan Experiences Are at the Heart of the Relationship</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies commented on the agreement in a promotional new video announcing the partnership.</p>
<p>David Brookes, senior commercial director for the European Tour Group, said that finding a betting partner was a natural step for the league.</p>
<p>I think the drama of golf lends itself perfectly to having a betting partner and in creating this partnership with OlyBet as our official European betting operator, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to once again evolve and innovate experiences for the golf fans. David Brookes, senior commercial director, European Tour Group</p>
<p>Brooks added that his team is truly passionate about what it will be able to deliver with OlyBet, saying that this betting agreement will provide fans with new opportunities.</p>
<p>Corey Plummer, chair and CEO of Olympic Entertainment Group and OlyBet Group, said that his team always seeks to leverage the thrill of sports to provide sports aficionados with unforgettable experiences. Plummer added that there are very few sports and activities that are better at bringing thrill, anticipation and excitement than golf.</p>
<p>This is a natural sport for competition, you can play it at all ages and all levels and be very competitive. So we want to create those kind of moments that bring more of that competitive juice and the thrill of the game to as many people as possible. Corey Plummer, CEO, OlyBet Group</p>
<p>Plummer concluded that golf is growing rapidly and that there are many markets hungry for more golf content. However, he noted that being able to engage with golf through content really elevates the experience.</p>
<p>Plummer concluded that he is excited to provide European punters with more opportunities to engage with the sport and the players themselves.</p>
