<p>According to a survey conducted between September 12 and 14, 2022, approximately 53 percent of Minnesota voters backed the legalization of marijuana for recreational use.</p>
<p>800 voters participated in the survey, held by Mason Dixon Polling and Strategy, an independent polling firm with an A-rating. The majority of the Minnesota voters supported the legalization of recreational marijuana, 36 percent thought the state of Minnesota should not legalize it and 11 percent remained undecided.</p>
<p>Republicans against the Legalization of Cannabis</p>
<p>Most of the representatives of GOP opposed the legalization, with 65 percent, while only 29 percent of Republicans supported it; 6 percent remained unsure. On the other hand, 60 percent of the independent voters and 70 percent of Democrats backed the proposal.</p>
<p>60 percent of Minnesotans aged between 18 and 49 voted in favor of recreational marijuana and roughly 50 percent of the voters between 50 and 64 supported the idea. As for the Minnesotans who are 65 and older, 47 percent were in favor and 44% were against the idea.</p>
<p>In northern Minnesota, most voters supported the idea. More men opposed the legalization than women. Nadine Garcia, a 35-year-old nurse from Crystal, Minnesota who participated in the poll, said that she would rather support the legalization of recreational cannabis because its criminalization “does more harm than good.”</p>
<p>In July 2022 THC Containing Edibles and Beverages Became Legal in Minnesota</p>
<p>The survey was conducted almost a year after the Minnesota House, controlled by the Democrats, passed a bill for the legalization of recreational cannabis, which, however, was stopped from becoming law. In addition, as of July 2022, edibles and beverages, which contain the psychoactive cannabis ingredient THC (tetrahydrocannabinol causing high feeling), became legal in Minnesota. Minnesotans who are 21 or older can buy any products, which contain up to 5 milligrams of THC. Heather Edelson, a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and the Minnesota House of Representatives, stated that the aforementioned law would strengthen the control over the marijuana market.</p>
<p>In February 2020, another poll was conducted and 51% of the voters showed support for the legalization of recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>Less than Half of the Minnesotans Support Legalization of Sports Betting</p>
<p>Another survey regarding the legalization of sports betting was held and less than half of the registered voters in Minnesota backed the legalization of gambling on sports, while 33 percent stated they were against the change and 19 percent remained undecided.</p>
<p>In May 2022 the Minnesota House passed a bill concerning sports betting, which, though, was not supported by the Senate.</p>
<p>As the Supreme Court issued a decision in 2018 regarding the legalization of betting on sporting events, over 30 states have already legalized it and others are to do so as well.</p>
