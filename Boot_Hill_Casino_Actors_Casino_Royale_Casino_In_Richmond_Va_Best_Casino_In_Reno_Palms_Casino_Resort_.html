    <h1>Boot Hill Casino Actors Casino Royale Casino In Richmond Va Best Casino In Reno Palms Casino Resort</h1>

<p>Can you give me an example of what qualifies as my account being verified ???? I sent screen shots of emails , I received free spins I’m not sure what you r asking me to send they verify my phone number I do not have record of it … I can not access my account anymore to show you transactions ! I was not with them that long ! But I am still a customer with other sites that they work with ! I have made several withdrawals with them I made referrals no issues ! Using the same people they are claiming does not exist !!!! My mother just had her first win last weekend ! With a a casino in their network ! They would of told her the same thing … this is the only casino that decides when I win I am stealing … they are using this as a "</p>
<p>cop out not to pay !" I read in forums that this casino if good fro it when they do not want to pay nice payouts ! Their own customer service rep said this happens all the time … they said when people sign up they are often near each other ! My father was near me that day !!! He lost I won !! If it was me I should have the skills to win ! I never won on their site before that day !!! What do you all need as proof my account being verified ?</p>
