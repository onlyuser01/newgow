    <h1>Pittsburgh Casinos Casino With No Deposit Bonus Casino Hotels In Albuquerque Nm Hard Rock Biloxi Cas</h1>

<p>Seeking to bolster its brand marketing efforts, the leading sportsbook for live betting, PointsBet, announced strategic marketing hires Thursday.</p>
<p>The Leading iGaming Operator Selects New VP of Brand Strategy and Marketing</p>
<p>PointsBet said that it selected Ansley O’Neal, who spearheaded consumer-facing brands of the International Olympic Committee, to serve as the company’s new VP of brand strategy and marketing. The company revealed that it also hired the services of the sports gaming industry veteran Josh Powell who will serve as director of brand marketing.</p>
<p>Overall, O’Neal has more than 15 years of international sports brand development experience. In her new position, she will be in charge of creating and implementing brand and marketing strategies. O’Neal will report directly to PointsBet’s chief marketing officer, Kyle Christensen. Before joining PointsBet, O’Neal managed leading consumer-facing brands as a part of the International Olympic Committee. While a part of the Committee, she oversaw the largest ever Samsung Athlete phone program and the delivery of the phones to the athletes in Tokyo in 2020. Moreover, O’Neal created a carbon offsetting program for the Olympic Movement called Dow Carbon Partnership.</p>
<p>PointsBet Picks New Director of Brand and Marketing</p>
<p>On the other hand, Powell, who will serve as director of brand and marketing, will report to O’Neal. In his new position, he will collaborate with the design and marketing teams to execute campaigns related to sports betting. His professional background includes leading betting industry operators such as Paddy Power. While a part of Paddy Power, Powell executed different marketing campaigns and assisted with multiple partnerships. Just before his appointment at PointsBet, he was a part of The Tenth Man, a start-up marketing agency, where he served as director of social and digital.</p>
<p>“In an industry that’s marked by outsized promos and ad blitzes, PointsBet is aiming to deviate away from this norm and leverage marketing tactics that work to enhance live sports for fans and bettors while maximizing on the current sports betting boom in the states.” Kyle Christensen, chief marketing officer at PointsBet USA</p>
<p>Kyle Christensen, PointsBet USA’s chief marketing officer, acknowledged that big promotions and innovative ads are a part of the betting industry currently. However, he said that the company seeks to stand out from the common marketing tactics and implement a new strategy that will bring exciting experiences for sports fans. In conclusion, Christensen said that PointsBet is thrilled to have Powell and O’Neal join the company while it continues to grow further into the US betting market.</p>
