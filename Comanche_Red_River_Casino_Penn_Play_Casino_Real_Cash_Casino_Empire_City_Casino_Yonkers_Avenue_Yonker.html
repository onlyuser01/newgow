<p>Man City stands a chance to win the 9th trophy in the top English flight and become tied with Everton in the fourth place of the most successful clubs in England. For that to happen, they only need another victory before the end of the 2022-23 season. And that win might happen on Sunday against Chelsea.</p>

<p>Manchester City to Tick Another Box From their 2022-23 Checklist</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s men have another three rounds to play in the Premier League, but they want to get the job done as soon as possible. If they win on Sunday, they’re going to secure the title, which would allow them to focus on the Champions League and the FA Cup. In both of these competitions, they’ve reached the final.</p>
<p>So, can they beat Chelsea and make sure the Premier League title stays in their possession? The answer is yes. After all, they did it in each of their last five duels. What’s interesting is that we saw them keep a clean sheet in each of those games.</p>
<p>The big question here isn’t whether Man City will win on Sunday, but will Chelsea be able to score a consolation goal?</p>
<p>Have the Blues Given Up on the 2022-23 Season?</p>
<p>Chelsea is sitting in the No. 11 position in the Premier League, and no matter what happens in the remainder of the season, they won’t be able to qualify for any of the European competitions. In fact, even moving up to the top half of the table by the end of the season looks almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Blues have three more games to play in the Prem, which gives them the opportunity to evaluate things and figure out what needs changing in the next season. It’s going to be a big season for them – they won’t have any continental duties to steer them off the course in the EPL.</p>
<p>To make sure they do well next season, the Blues need to separate the wheat from the chaff. And the remainder of the 2022-23 season is when it’s time to do it. That said, we could see some new faces on the pitch on Sunday, with Frank Lampard possibly experimenting with some new tactics.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s men have all the motivation in the world to win this match. Frank Lampard’s boys do not. Plus, this game is played at Etihad, which is where Man City has won every single game in 2023. We honestly doubt Chelsea can put an end to it, but the Blues will surely try to make things more interesting. That’s why we expect to see a lot of goals on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
