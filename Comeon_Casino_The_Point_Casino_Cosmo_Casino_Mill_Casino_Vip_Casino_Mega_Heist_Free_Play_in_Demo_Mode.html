<p>Mega Heist review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Mega Heist is a prison-themed slot game from Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>The slot follows a group of convicts as they first attempt to break out of jail and then commit three heists at different locations across the city.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is known for its quirky game designs, and that is definitely a fair adjective to use for Mega Heist. The game is based around a gang of criminals attempting to escape the police and commit a series of heists.</p>
<p>While slots like Hellcatraz 2 Dream Drop are similar in theme, Mega Heist differentiates itself aesthetically with a cartoonish design. Titles like Beelionaires Dream Drop or Fly Cats Dream Drop have a similar approach.</p>
<p>The characters all have fun designs, with moustachioed policemen chasing an assortment of criminals. The slot also shifts between three different locations, starting in a prison before moving to a gas station, club, and bank. It also features various animated sequences, all of which add to the gameâ€™s fun atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Mega Heist starts out on a fairly standard 5x4 game grid. It has 178 ways to win that are active on every spin.</p>
<p>You will find the control panel for the game under the reels. Here, you can hit the spin button, change the stake, or use the autospin option if you want to let the criminals do the hard work for you.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>All of the bonuses in this slot are based on trying to bust the convicts out of prison. The first bonus is the Escape Bonus, which launches when you land two Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Random feature of the game - the Escape Bonus round</p>
<p>When this triggers, up to four prisoners will attempt to escape. Prisoners will be placed on a separate grid where they need to move across five spaces to escape. Each prisoner will carry either a prize or a bonus symbol. They will move one position each time, and then police officers will appear above random positions. If they are caught, then they are removed from the grid. If they get to the other end with a prize, then you will be paid the prize. If they get to the other end with a Bonus symbol, then you will launch the Mega Heist Bonus.</p>
<p>You can also trigger this bonus by landing three or more Bonus symbols. Three, four, or five symbols will place 10, 15, or 30 prisoners on the grid, respectively. This operates in a similar way to the standard Escape bonus, only with much bigger prizes and a lot more elements.</p>
<p>Players can advance through three different phases, each with a higher total prize than the last. You will advance once you have got your prisoners to the end zone with all of the prize money. If all of your prisoners are caught, then the round will end.</p>
<p>The gas station, club, and bank are the three stages, and they have a total prize of 150x, 1,500x, and 15,000x, respectively. To help the criminals avoid capture, there are several power-up symbols that can appear:</p>
<p>Multipliers : These multiply the prize a criminal has.</p>
<p>: These multiply the prize a criminal has. Additional Criminals : This adds extra criminals to the game.</p>
<p>: This adds extra criminals to the game. Disguise : This one changes the criminal to a policeman, allowing them to go undetected across the grid.</p>
<p>: This one changes the criminal to a policeman, allowing them to go undetected across the grid. No police : This removes the police for the next go, allowing everyone to advance one step unquestioned.</p>
<p>: This removes the police for the next go, allowing everyone to advance one step unquestioned. Motorbike : This appears and can take two criminals in one row to the end zone.</p>
<p>: This appears and can take two criminals in one row to the end zone. Bus: This takes up to eight criminals to the end zone.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>These criminals know how to serve up some good winnings. The maximum win in Mega Heist is 15,000x your stake, with the RTP being above average at 96.19%. We always recommend looking for slots with an above-average RTP in our slot strategy guide. We also recommend looking for slots that are highly volatile, which is exactly what Mega Heist is.</p>
<p>The smallest you can bet in the game is $0.10, and the maximum is $100, giving this a healthy betting range.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Mega Heist slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>There is a lot to like about the Mega Heist slot. The game stands out for its unique bonus features and serves up plenty of fun when you trigger them. The highly volatile action, combined with a 15,000x maximum win means that Mega Heist is definitely a slot we recommend taking for a spin.</p>
