<p>The deal provides a boost for Vincitu's offering and at the same time expands Playson's footprint in the country and on the Old Continent</p>
<p>The fast-growing digital entertainment supplier, Playson, announced a new deal expanding further its European presence. Details of the new deal emerged Wednesday and see the company provide its most popular games for Vincitu, a leading operator in Italy.</p>

<p>Still, Playson confirmed that it anticipates launching additional games with Vincitu in Italy soon. The deal represents a major achievement for the operator that is currently among the most popular sportsbook and casino providers in the regulated gambling market in Italy. In addition to expanding the operator’s offering, the deal helps boost the reach of Playson’s content and delivers its leading games to new players.</p>

Finally, Marra noted: “Thanks to the latest innovations, Playson is able to enhance the experience for players day after day, creating a product capable of meeting the highest quality standards.”</p>
<p>“We are very happy to finally be online with Playson’s innovative content.“ Francesco Marra, casino manager at Vincitu</p>
<p>Alessandra Rosati, Playson’s account manager, added that Italy represents a significantly important market in Europe. She pointed out that the company is delighted to deliver its fan-favorite games for Vincitu in the country.</p>

<p>“These three games are some of our best and we are convinced the operator’s player base will love the variety we have to offer,” added Rosati. Finally, Playson’s account manager said that the company plans to release new games this year and is looking forward to the success the deal with Vincitu will bring.</p>
