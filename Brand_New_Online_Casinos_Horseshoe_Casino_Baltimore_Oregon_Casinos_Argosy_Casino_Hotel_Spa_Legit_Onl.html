Recurring annually, this year March Madness features 63 basketball games. This year marks the 83rd edition of the tournament. The tournament is scheduled to start March 15 and its final game is planned for April 4, 2022.</p>
<p>Just in time for the start of the tournament, bet365 announced the launch of a special promotion called bet365 Bracket Challenge. The special promotion promises a life-changing top prize of $5 million for the player that can correctly predict the outcome of all 63 March Madness matches.</p>

<p>How Can Sports Fans Participate in the Bracket Challenge?</p>
<p>Sports fans that are interested in participating in the new promotion need to be 21 or older and verify their identity for the operator. The Bracket Challenge is available for new and eligible customers in Canada or the US. Players from the US must register or use an already registered account with Hillside LLC (New Jersey) to participate in the challenge.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that bet365 allows only one entry per eligible person. The operator explained that it will monitor the use of multiple accounts by the same individual or group. In case bet365 finds reasonable grounds to suspect multiple entries by the same player or group those entries will be voided.</p>
<p>Many Prizes Are up for Grabs</p>
<p>To win the $5,000,000 prize, a player would need to guess the perfect bracket. In other words, they would need to correctly predict the outcome of all 63 games. However, bet365 features prizes even if no one guesses the perfect bracket.</p>
<p>By participating and guessing correct predictions, each player receives points. The player that has accumulated the most correct predictions that brought him the highest number of points will win $100,000. Moreover, the player that takes the second position will collect $25,000, while the player with the third position will go home with $10,000.</p>
<p>The prize for the player that takes the fourth position based on the earned points will collect $5,000, while the prize for the fifth position is $1,000. Overall, there will be additional prizes for players up to the 250th position.</p>
<p>Players That Submit Correct Predictions Receive Points</p>
<p>According to bet365, there will be different points awarded for correct predictions depending on the round. Round 1 covers the games on March 17 and March 18 and brings 10 points. Moreover, Round 2 is between March 19 and March 20 and it will give 20 points for players that submit correct a prediction.</p>
<p>Round 3 / Round of 16 will grant 40 points, while Round 4 / Round of 8 will give 80 points. Players that correctly predict the semi-finals on April 2 will receive 160 points. Last but not least, players that guess the final which is on April 4 will get 320 points.</p>
