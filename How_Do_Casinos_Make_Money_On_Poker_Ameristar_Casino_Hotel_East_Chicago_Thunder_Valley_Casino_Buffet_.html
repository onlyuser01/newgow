    <h1>How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago Thunder Valley Casino Buffet</h1>

<p>OnAir Entertainment, a live casino studio seeking to inspire and engage players with best-in-class games, has unveiled Card Matchup, a brand new sports-themed game. The new title is set to go live in November this year.</p>
<p>Card Matchup Goes Live on November 10</p>
<p>Card Matchup is a new and scalable live table game that is designed to appeal to a broad range of players. The concept is fairly simple – players have to guess whether their team or their opponent’s team will emerge victorious and bet on it. After that, the teams would draw cards and the side with the highest card would win the match.</p>
<p>To make this simple concept more exciting, OnAir Entertainment will provide players with odds that allow them to follow all bets placed, see earlier results and check their winning streak. In addition, Card Matchup boasts a highly-customizable user interface that partnering operators can customize to their own liking. iGaming companies that opt to add Card Matchup to their offerings can implement their logo and set the UI color to one that represents their brand.</p>
<p>The best thing about Card Matchup is that an unlimited number of players can join and bet on the outcomes while a live host flips the cards. The new game is a great addition to OnAir Entertainment’s roster of engaging live casino games, which includes both classic and innovative titles.</p>
<p>OnAir Continues Its Steady Growth</p>
<p>Armands Zalitis, OnAir Entertainment’s head of product, commented on the new release. Zalitis noted that Card Matchup will provide a dynamic sports-like experience to fans of live casino games.</p>
<p>We bring a new complete experience with table animations across different game phases, offering tailored offerings to our clients and centered around sports. Armands Zalitis, head of product, OnAir Entertainment</p>
<p>The new title, according to Zalitis, is “yet another remarkable outcome” that was possible only thanks to the hard work of OnAir Entertainment’s experienced and enthusiastic team.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment was founded less than two years ago but has already established itself as the go-to live casino provider. In less than 10 months, OnAir launched in nine new markets which greatly expanded the company’s footprint. The company will soon open new studios to keep up with the growing demand for its content. The first studio will open in Romania around Q4 2022, followed by the opening of new studios in Spain and Georgia at the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>A few days ago, OnAir Entertainment announced the launch of Eclipse Blackjack, another novel live casino title that will go live this October.</p>
