<p>ParlayBay, which has been making significant strides in Asia, is delighted by the opportunity to reach even more local players</p>
<p>ParlayBay, a startup provider of online sports betting experiences, has penned a new content agreement with M88 Mansion, a leading Asian iGaming and sports betting platform. Under the new deal, ParlayBay will provide its new partner with sports betting content.</p>
<p>The agreement will greatly expand the supplier’s footprint in Asia, allowing its products to reach many local players. This includes its upcoming Stack‘Em title, an in-play and pre-match betbuilder that provides sports fans with a massive winning potential. Stack’Em’s confirmed release date is April 17, at which point M88 customers will get to experience ParlayBay’s innovative take on sports betting.</p>
<p>The provider will also power the operator with CS:GO esports betting content, allowing M88 to engage its players with markets for one of the most popular video games ever.</p>
<p>M88 Mansion is one of the biggest online gaming and sports betting sites in Asia. The operator will hugely benefit from the current agreement with ParlayBay, as it will secure a variety of new offerings. At the same time, ParlayBay will greatly expand its local presence, engaging more people in the region with its games.</p>
<p>ParlayBay seeks to disrupt sports betting as we know it and pioneer titles that offer an unparalleled player-centric experience. The provider seeks to offer fast gameplay paired with interesting mechanics, such as re-buy, cash-out and leaderboards. In addition to that, the company offers a selection of social tools.</p>
<p>ParlayBay Is Happy to Expand Its Reach in Asia</p>
<p>Patrick Nordawall, ParlayBay’s chief executive officer, said that his team is very happy to see its content go live with M88 Mansion. He added that the provider is making significant progress in Asia and is looking to expand its local audience.</p>
<p>ParlayBay is making significant moves across Asia and this partnership allows us to reach a wide and engaged audience of bettors across the continent. Patrick Nordawall, CEO, ParlayBay</p>
<p>Joy Lao, M88 Mansion’s operational division head, also commented on the matter, saying that the operator is very glad to welcome ParlayBay as a partner.</p>
<p>We at M88 Mansion are extremely excited to partner with ParlayBay and for our customers to enjoy content like Stack ‘Em, where players can enjoy innovative live Bet Builder Games across multiple matches at once. Joy Lao, operational division head, M88 Mansion</p>
<p>ParlayBay focuses primarily on micro-betting markets and offers products that appeal to many modern bettors. Its games leverage real-time data feeds to provide new and intuitive permutations of in-play betting opportunities. Its best-class AI/ML algorithms price up markets, ensuring accuracy for customers.</p>
<p>In other news, in late January, M88 further expanded its portfolio by adding live-streaming games from Livespins.</p>
