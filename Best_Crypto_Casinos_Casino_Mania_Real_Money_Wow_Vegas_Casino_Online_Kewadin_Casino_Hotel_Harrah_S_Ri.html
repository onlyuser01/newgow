<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden raised $46.7 million in March, his best month ever. But his campaign is still at a serious disadvantage compared to President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) disclose that Biden’s campaign received a surge in contributions following his securing of the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.</p>
<p>His March fundraising was more than double the $18 million the 77-year-old raised in February. Seventy percent of Biden’s donations came online, with the average contribution $40.</p>
<p>Trump raised just $13.6 million last month. But with donations to the Republican National Committee (RNC), his campaign raised $63 million in March. The RNC has had the advantage of supporting just one 2020 presidential candidate, compared to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which saw more than 20 candidates run for the party’s ticket.</p>
<p>Trump’s reelection campaign currently has roughly $244 million on hand. Biden and the DNC have approximately $57 million.</p>
<p>Odds Stagnant</p>
<p>The coronavirus has overshadowed the fact that America heads to the polls in just 194 days to decide who will be commander in chief come January 2021. As a result, online political odds have changed little over the last month.</p>
<p>PredictIt’s “Who will win the 2020 US presidential election?” has Trump’s shares at 50 cents. Biden is second at 45 cents. Americans are relatively split on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, the Real Clear Politics polling average showing 47.3 percent in approval, and 50.3 percent in disapproval.</p>
<p>Biden has been outspoken against the president’s handling of the health crisis.</p>
<p>“The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not,” Biden said this week.</p>
<p>Biden’s campaign has scheduled 14 remote fundraisers over the next few weeks. Meanwhile, Trump remains relatively stuck in the White House, as his administration continues to tackle the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The question “Will Joe Biden raise more than Donald Trump in May?” has the former VP a heavy favorite at 89 cents.</p>
<p>VP Obama?</p>
<p>Biden has committed to picking a woman to be his running mate, and California Sen. Kamala Harris remains the frontrunner at 28 cents. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is next at 24 cents, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren third at 12 cents.</p>
<p>Many Democrats are hoping that the party can put Obama back in the White House – but not the former President, but former First Lady. Appearing on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Biden spoke about his admiration for Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>I’d take her in a heartbeat. She’s brilliant,” Biden stated. “She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman, and the Obamas are great friends. I have great, great admiration. She’s brilliant. She’s wonderful.”</p>
<p>However, Biden conceded that he doesn’t think “she has any desire to live near the White House again.” Mrs. Obama’s shares of being his running mate are at a distant six cents.</p>
