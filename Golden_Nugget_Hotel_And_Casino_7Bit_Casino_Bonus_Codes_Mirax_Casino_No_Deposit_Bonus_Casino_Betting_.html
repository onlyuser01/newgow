<p>The blockchain-based model employed by the company sets it apart from its competition</p>
<p>BetDEX Labs’s BetDEX Exchange has been greenlit for launch in Ireland. The remote betting intermediary license is effective as of July 1 this year, allowing the exchange to offer online sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>As a result, customers in Ireland will now be able to access the BetDEX Exchange and play. The company offers high speeds, attractive costs and flexibility that few other companies can match.</p>
<p>Another thing that sets BetDEX apart from its competition is its non-custodial model that never places BetDEX in charge of players’ money. Instead, the bets are held on transparent blockchain-based contracts. This model results in lower fees compared to other betting companies.</p>
<p>The launch in Ireland couldn’t have come at a better time for the company, considering the recent approval of in-play bets for tennis and cricket games. In addition to in-play markets, BetDEX promised to launch a variety of side markets for soccer and tennis matches.</p>
<p>In the meantime, BetDEX will continue to expand its offering by launching more markets for its global audience. At the same time, the company will pursue further growth opportunities. In 2022, for example, the exchange secured a license from the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>New but Familiar Territory of Operation</p>
<p>BetDEX’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Varun Sudhakar, expressed his thoughts on the matter. He emphasized that Ireland is a familiar yet new territory for his team, which is headquartered in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Sudhakar praised Ireland’s rich history of sports betting and said that the new license is a huge opportunity to introduce blockchain-based solutions to the local market.</p>
<p>Ireland has a rich history of being at the forefront of sports betting advancements, and while this license provides Irish citizens with the opportunity to bet using our platform, it also introduces the region to the power and benefits of blockchain and web3 technologies. Varun Sudhakar, co-founder &amp; CEO, BetDEX</p>
<p>The executive concluded that his team will continue to promote web3 betting platforms across the globe.</p>
<p>BetDEX Labs’ co-founder and chairman, Nigel Eccles, described Ireland as a “leader in innovation and the adoption of new technologies.” He added that the new license attests to the country’s desire to remain at the forefront of betting advancements.</p>
<p>On behalf of the BetDEX team, we are excited to provide a superior betting experience to the people of Ireland. Nigel Eccles, co-founder &amp; chair, BetDEX Labs</p>
<p>In March, BetDEX added Indian Premier League markets to its platform, hailing the move as a major milestone.</p>
