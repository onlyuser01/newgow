<p>The trust chose the cash value and received $157,367,045 before taxes</p>
<p>A group of lucky South Dakotan players working together as the Blue Yucca Trust have won October’s $360 million Mega Millions jackpot. The trust purchased the ticket at a gas station in San Angelo, Texas, unaware of the fortune it would bring them.</p>
<p>As reported, the Blue Yucca Trust successfully matched the correct numbers, including the Mega Ball. For reference, the winning combination was 12, 24, 46, 57, 66 and Mega Ball 22.</p>
<p>While the trust is based in Rapid City, South Dakota, the winning ticket was sold in Texas, making it the biggest lottery win in the latter state’s history. For reference, the trust chose the cash value and received $157,367,045 before taxes. The store which sold the ticket to the winner has been provided a $1 million bonus.</p>
<p>The Blue Yucca Trust goes down not only as the biggest lottery winner in Texan history but also as the first player in Texas to win the Mega Millions jackpot since 2019. For reference, back then a local won the $227 jackpot in September.</p>
<p>US Lotteries Remain Popular</p>
<p>In the meantime, fans across the United States are preparing for the next Mega Millions drawing that will take place today. The drawing will provide players across the United States with a shot at the current prize of $267 million.</p>
<p>Mega Millions players need to select six numbers from 1 to 70, as well as a single Mega Ball number from 1 to 25. Matching all of these is a certain path to riches. Players can also add a Megaplier option that dramatically increases their chance to win.</p>
<p>Players across America are also anticipating the next Powerball drawing, set to take place on November 18. Currently, the Powerball jackpot stands at $280 million with an approximate cash value of $128.6 million.</p>
<p>Speaking of Powerball, in October, a lucky Californian player won the staggering $1.76 billion Powerball jackpot, making them the second-largest winner in the game’s history. For reference, the biggest Powerball prize ever stood at $2.04 billion and was grabbed by Edwin Castro, another Californian player.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a man from Albuquerque, New Mexico, won the jackpot from the popular game Lotto America, bringing the grand prize of $3.52 million back home.</p>
