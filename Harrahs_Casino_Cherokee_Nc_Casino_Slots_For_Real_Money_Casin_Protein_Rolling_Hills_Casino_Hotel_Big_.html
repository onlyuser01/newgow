<p>Supplier of gaming technology and content Inspired Entertainment announced today its popular online casino content launched in Connecticut with DraftKings.</p>
<p>Expanding Presence in the US</p>
<p>The launch of Inspired Entertainment’s online gaming content in Connecticut marked the third US state that now features titles from the rich gaming portfolio of the B2B provider of content, systems and solutions.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to launch our best Interactive games early in the process in Connecticut, which is in its iGaming infancy.” Brooks Pierce, President and COO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Connecticut became the third US gaming jurisdiction to feature Inspired’s content, expanding the supplier’s presence in New Jersey and Michigan where it launched its titles in July and May last year.</p>
<p>“We have grown our presence in both New Jersey and Michigan, where we are now represented with 70% of operators, respectively, and we intend to do the same in Connecticut. We view the North American iGaming market as a huge opportunity, and key to our strategy of growing the digital segments of our business.” Brooks Pierce, President and COO, Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Under the launch with DraftKings, Inspired’s popular and entertaining game titles such as Big Spin Bonus, Bullion Bars and Gold Cash Free Spins are now available in the Constitution State and Inspired is adamant more titles will be coming down the pipeline soon.</p>
<p>Online Gaming is Gathering Speed</p>
<p>In October last year, Connecticut officially launched regulated online gambling to become the sixth US jurisdiction to introduce digital gaming. Online gambling became reality after the US Department of the Interior approved the amended state compacts signed by Governor Ned Lamont with the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes.</p>
<p>In its first month of operation, October, the Constitution State reported $312.5 million in online casino wagers and $53.5 million in sports wagering, generating $1.7 million in taxes to the state, while the two operators generated $10 million in online casino revenue.</p>
<p>The month saw Mohegan Digital acquire $3 million in online casino gaming profit, having generated $123 million in wagers, paid out winners of $119 million and given out $1 million in promotions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Mashantucket Pequots, the tribe operating Foxwoods Resort Casino, acquired $4.8 million in profit, derived from $189.5 million in wagers, $183.5 million paid out in winnings and $1.2 million spent on promotions.</p>
<p>Online casino revenue grew to approximately $19 million in January, the state’s third full month of operations, showing the state is still in its nascent days and far from reaching its full potential.</p>
<p>In December, Inspired Entertainment signed an agreement with Rush Street Interactive to integrate its gaming content into the operator’s platform across New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia, as well as in other authorized jurisdictions where the partnership will take effect.</p>
