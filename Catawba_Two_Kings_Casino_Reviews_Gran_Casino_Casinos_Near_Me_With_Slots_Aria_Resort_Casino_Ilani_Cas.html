<p>Online sports betting and casino gaming operator Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced the opening of two new offices in Bogota and Medellin as part of its continued expansion in Latin America.</p>
<p>Latin American Headquarters</p>
<p>The operator of the RushBet brand in Colombia and Mexico opened a new 8,000-square-foot office in the heart of the Colombian capital that will serve as the headquarters for RSI’s Latin American operations team.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, RSI’s chief executive officer Richard Schwartz hailed the new offices as investments for the future of the region and recognition of “the importance of earning the trust and respect of the communities” where RSI is operational.</p>
<p>It’s important to have the brightest and strongest local teams to execute RSI’s ambitious growth strategy. Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>The cutting-edge design of RSI’s Latin American headquarters is an embodiment of innovation that is central to the Chicago-based gaming operator, as well as a display of the essence of the gaming industry delivering fun and exciting experiences to its customers.</p>
<p>The office space is surrounded by a full multimedia wall for watching live sports, while other amenities include an actual basketball court functioning as the marketing team’s space, poker rooms-like conference rooms, a stadium-like production set, lamps resembling casino cards, and a cafeteria that is a replica of RushBet’s sports bars.</p>
<p>Tech Hub Expansion</p>
<p>The second office space was opened in Medellin, where RSI expanded its technology hub in the El Poblado neighborhood to house a team of local tech talent and provide support for the operator’s global technology platform.</p>
<p>The area was selected due to its attractiveness for tech talent following the local government’s investment to create a software valley under the “Vale de Software” project.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to attract IT businesses and students from the best universities in Latin America by promising them a successful career in the IT field, and provides an additional impetus for RSI to set foot in the region which already boasts over 163,000 companies from different economic sectors.</p>
<p>These new state-of-the-art offices further exemplify our innovation and continued investment in Latin America and the future growth we expect in the region. Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>Schwartz highlighted the importance for RSI “to invest in creating world-class facilities to continue to attract and retain top industry talent” and strengthen its presence in Latin America.</p>
<p>As the first US-based operator to enter the Colombian market, RSI has grown to a top-three market position, partnering with leading media businesses, banks, retailers, and sports leagues to increase brand awareness among the locals.</p>
<p>Last month, RSI published its third-quarter results posting 20% increases in both revenue and net loss.</p>
