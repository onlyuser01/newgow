<p>Pragmatic Play is expanding its reach in the Latin American market with Gaming Platforms, a company that is dedicated to operating outstanding brands across every vertical of the iGaming experience.</p>
<p>As a result, Pragmatic Play will deploy its slots, live casino, and virtual sports products which will hit the market with the new operator.</p>
<p>There are more than 300 titles that Gaming Platforms players will soon be able to access, including iconic and established options such as Zeus vs Hades – Gods of Wars, Jewel Rush, Gates ofOlympus, Treasure Island, and Sweet Bonanza Candyland, as some of the live gaming options.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has built an outstanding portfolio of titles that is now available on Gaming Platforms. The news was naturally welcomed by Pragmatic Play VP of Latin American Operations at ARRISE, Victor Arias, who said that Gaming Platforms is another important partner for the company in its pursuit of further expansion.</p>
<p>"Pragmatic Play is delighted to sign the deal and looks forward to rolling out in due course," Arias said. The executive recently spoke with Casino Guru News, detailing his company’s plans for the Latin American market and what Pragmatic Play expects to achieve locally.</p>
<p>Gaming Platforms Commercial Manager Maria Laura Sequeira was similarly excited about the opportunity and said that it was a great thing to see so many new and exciting games become a part of the portfolio.</p>
<p>"We always strive for the best in entertainment and this deal helps us achieve that," Sequeira added. Pragmatic Play has been growing its footprint actively in the region, with the supplier recently teaming up with Betmais in Brazil, seeking to similarly consolidate its footprint.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Pragmatic also launched with its trifecta of products, including slots, live casino and virtual sports. Pragmatic feels confident about the future of the Latin American market and is already showing very strong local leadership.</p>
<p>As Arias himself put it, the company is no longer worried about positioning – it has become a matter of maintaining its leadership instead.</p>
