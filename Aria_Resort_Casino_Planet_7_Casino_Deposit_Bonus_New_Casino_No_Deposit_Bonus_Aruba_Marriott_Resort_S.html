<p>The tech and media company Spotlight Sports Group and the online gambling company Betfair have reiterated their commitment to one another by extending their video content deal.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Enhance the Betting Post Live Show</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports will continue to produce premium live content for Betfair for another year. The agreement aims to improve the former’s racing-oriented series, Racing Post Live – a show where racing specialists provide live insights, breakdowns, and analysis of the trending racing events. With the deal expanded, the Racing Post Live will now include the most important Saturday races as well as all of the big events in Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>With Spotlight Sports and Betfair vowing to continue their collaboration, bettors will see live content enhanced with market-leading graphics that provide access to the freshest Betfair Exchange data. This way racing enthusiasts can react on time and grab the best betting opportunities.</p>
<p>Racing Post has become synonymous with quality betting content. It is the to-go place where many racing enthusiasts inform themselves of the latest developments in horseracing. Furthermore, the show often sees some of the big names in horseracing join as guests and discuss the sector.</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports and Betfair’s continued partnership promises to boost the quality of the beloved racing show and provide bettors and sports fans with even more excitement.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Excited to Continue Their Partnership</p>
<p>Betfair’s head of media relations, Barry Orr, spoke on the extended deal between the operator and Spotlight Sports. He revealed that the whole Betfair team is thrilled to continue working with Spotlight for another year. Orr is glad that the partnership has provided Betfair with access to Racing Post Live – yet another platform where the operator can promote its world-leading betting exchange. Orr added:</p>
<p>“Setting your own odds, being a backer or a layer and betting in-running are all brought to life for new and existing customers who watch the show and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.” Betfair head of media relations Barry Orr</p>
<p>Sam Houlding, the chief executive officer of Spotlight Sports Group, also spoke on the deal. He mentioned that his company’s live content has seen impressive growth in the past three years which is why he is glad to continue the partnership with Betfair.</p>
<p>Houlding emphasized that Racing Post Live has become the show of choice of many horseracing fans and said that he is excited to take its content even further, especially with the Cheltenham Festival coming in a few weeks.</p>
<p>“Our video production keeps evolving and we’re delighted to continue developing shows that add fantastic value for both our Racing Post audience and our key partners” Spotlight Sports Group CEO Sam Houlding</p>
<p>Damian Mears, Spotlight’s head of media sales also spoke on the matter and thanked Betfair for their sponsorship. Mears explained that Betfair’s Exchange blends perfectly with the live aspect of the show and boosts the engagement of horseracing bettors.</p>
<p>Betfair has once again shown its commitment to the racing community. A few days ago the betting brand added the talented English National Hunt jockey Bryony Frost as a brand ambassador.</p>
