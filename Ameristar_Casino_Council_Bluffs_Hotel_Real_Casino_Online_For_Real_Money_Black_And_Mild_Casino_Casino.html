<p>Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Rams Open as Conference Championship Favorites</p>

<p>The Kansas City Chiefs endured in what many are calling perhaps the greatest NFL game of all-time last night at Arrowhead Stadium. Patrick Mahomes and company outlasted the Buffalo Bills 42-36 in overtime.</p>

<p>Mahomes didn’t exactly outduel Bills QB, Josh Allen. Instead, overtime rules allowed the Chiefs to score a touchdown on their first drive after winning the all-important coin flip in extra time. Allen was as remarkable as Mahomes but never got a chance in OT.</p>
<p>For a third straight trip to the Super Bowl, only the Cincinnati Bengals stand in the Chiefs’ way.</p>
<p>The Bengals, led by second-year quarterback Joe Burrow, upset the Tennessee Titans on the road, 19-16. After Ryan Tannehill was picked off by Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson on the Cincinnati 47-yard line with just 20 seconds remaining, Burrow and the Bengals managed to pick up 19 yards during the remaining time to set up a game-winning 52-yard field goal by Evan McPherson.</p>
<p>While Burrows is a rising star in the league, oddsmakers feel the main stage still belongs to Mahomes.</p>
<p>The consensus line for the AFC Championship opened with Kansas City spotting Cincinnati a touchdown (seven points). The over/under is at 54 points, and the moneyline at Bengals +255, Chiefs -320. A winning $100 bet on the moneyline respectively would net $255 and $31.25.</p>
<p>The Bengals-Chiefs kickoff is at 3:00 pm ET next Sunday, Jan. 30.</p>
<p>Rams vs. 49ers Rematch</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Los Angeles Rams were able to dethrone the defending champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers on the road, 30-27.</p>
<p>The Rams-Bucs contest was nearly as entertaining as the Sunday nightcap. Tampa Bay completed a comeback from a 27-3 third-quarter deficit with a nine-yard touchdown run by Leonard Fournette on a 4th &amp; 1 with just 42 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>But Rams QB Matthew Stafford was able to lead Los Angeles down the field on a five-play drive that set up kicker Matt Gay for the winning 30-yard field goal.</p>
<p>The 49ers managed to perhaps end Aaron Rodgers’ career in Green Bay by shocking the Packers 13-10 in a cold and snowy NFC divisional playoff game at Lambeau Field. Rodgers was relatively ho-hum, the future Hall of Famer throwing for 20/29 for 225 yards, but zero touchdowns.</p>
<p>In a battle of defenses, the game came down to kickers. After getting the ball back with 3:20 remaining, 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo and the San Francisco offense marched 44 yards down the field to give kicker Robbie Gould a 45-yard game-winning attempt. The veteran kicker knocked it through the uprights to send the Packers packing.</p>
<p>However, oddsmakers feel San Francisco’s run comes to an end next Sunday in Los Angeles. The early consensus has the Rams favored by 3.5 points, the over/under at 46.5 points, and the moneyline at Los Angeles -330, San Francisco +150.</p>
<p>The 49ers-Rams kickoff at 6:30 pm ET next Sunday, January 30. San Francisco won both matchups against the Rams this season.</p>
<p>Eyes on Inglewood</p>
<p>SoFi Stadium, located south of Los Angeles in Inglewood, will host Super Bowl LVI on Feb. 13. With a win on Sunday, the Rams would be only the second team to play a Super Bowl on their home turf.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers were the first team to play — and win — a Super Bowl on their home field last year.</p>
<p>As for hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy on Feb. 13, DraftKings has the Chiefs favored at +120, then the Rams +200, 49ers +450, and Bengals +800.</p>
