    <h1>Bingo Village Casino Login Big Dollar Casino Bonus Codes Casino M8Trix Horseshoe Casino Bossier City</h1>

<p>The operator has chosen MoneyLine, a product owned by PayNearMe, to bring the most comprehensive payment experience to consumers</p>
<p>MoneyLine is capable of integrating seamlessly with the IGT’s PlaySports platform and, as a result, offers Maverick Gaming and Maverick Sports customers a wide variety of payment options that make it easy to settle deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>MoneyLine Brings Best-in-Class Payment Experience</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Maverick Gaming CEO Eric Persson hailed the integration as a “real game changer” not just for Maverick Sports, but also for the industry. According to Persson, MoneyLine is a product that has a very strong bearing on the overall customer experience and brands only stand to benefit. He specified:</p>
<p>PayNearMe has consolidated the widest range of deposit and payout methods in the industry into a single platform integration with a consistent look and feel, which gives our customers a broad choice of payment options on a single screen. Maverick Gaming CEO Eric Persson</p>
<p>Because of how easy it is to integrate with leading platforms such as IGT PlaySports, users can use a number of payment solutions to facilitate their transactions safely, quickly, and reliably, with a range of payment options, including Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, cards, cash, and more.</p>
<p>Innovation and Strong Integration</p>
<p>As to PayNearMe, the company was similarly chuffed to see its solution integrated with yet another prominent operator. Company VP and general manager of iGaming and sports betting Leighton Webb had this to add outlining the latest developments:</p>
<p>PayNearMe gives operators the ability to offer cash, cards, ACH, Apple Pay, PayPal and Venmo for deposits, and payout options such as push to debit, PayPal and Venmo for funds availability in minutes as opposed to days. PayNearMe’s Leighton Webb</p>
<p>MoneyLine is not just a digital-first solution, as the company also features a Cardless Cash at-ATM solution, which is designed to offer even more convenience to betting players. PayNearMe has been specializing in the delivery of payment solutions for the iGaming and sports betting industries, ensuring that partner operators’ audiences have best-in-class experiences and opportunities.</p>
