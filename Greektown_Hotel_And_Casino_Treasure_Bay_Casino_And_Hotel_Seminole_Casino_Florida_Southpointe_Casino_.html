<p>Gaming Corps, an innovative Sweden-based developer of iGaming products for the online casino vertical, has expanded its presence in Belarus through a partnership with Brazino777, a now-established local operator, and a fairly new entrant into the market as well.</p>
<p>Brazino777, established in 2022, has already been able to cultivate a game library that exceeds 1,000 games and makes it easy for players to enjoy a worthwhile gameplay from start to finish. For its part, the casino has been pushing hard to ensure that it continues to add to this variety and grow the range of available titles at a good clip.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps CCO Danielle Calafato has welcomed the opportunity to supply Brazino777 with the company’s range of titles and welcomed the opportunity to work with a company that shares its own ethos.</p>
<p>"I very much look forward to giving Brazino777’s players a chance to enjoy our games and helping both Gaming Corps and Brazino777 grow further in the Belarussian market," Calafato explained.</p>
<p>The games Brazino777 may expect to find are such options as Raging Zeus, Mines, Wild Woof, Prospector’s Plinko, Super Hot Stacks, and quite a few others, along with original franchises developed by Gaming Corps, to name Coin Miner and JetLucky.</p>
<p>Brazino777 CEO Yulian Krotevich has welcomed the opportunity to see his company expand once again with a supplier that is a known name in the industry and that brings a lot to the table to create more memorable experiences for its players.</p>
<p>"GamingCorpsis an exciting provider that consistently produces original, thrilling content which I am certain will be popular among our players. I look forward to hosting their current game list on Brazino777 and further updating this offering withGamingCorps’ future releases," Krotevich added.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been actively growing its portfolio of games as well as pushing the boundaries of its geographical reach. The company has had a string of prominent partnerships accomplished over the past several months, including a tie-up with Betway in Africa.</p>
<p>The company similarly teamed up with Lottoland, providing the prominent operator with a range of its homebrewed and premium titles. Not least, Gaming Corps’ titles launched with Betfair Casino, as part of the brand’s ambitious global expansion push.</p>
