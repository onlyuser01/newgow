    <h1>Double Casino Promo Code Ballys Casino Online Atlantis Casino Resort Spa Reno Nv Casino Pittsburgh C</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently signed up to this casino and upon reviewing the responsible gambling options was satified with the offering.</p>
<p>However I soon learned that its extremely misleading and possibly malicious, as the terms are stated in such a way that it can mean multiple things.</p>
<p>For example, they state:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tuskcasino offers self-exclusion facilities for those customers who wish to restrict their gambling activities with Tuskcasino. The following self-protection mechanisms are available and can be entered via the responsible gaming link in the footer of the website:</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1. Self-exclusion</p>
<p>1.2. Cool down period</p>
<p>1.3. Set financial limits on wagers and losses</p>
<p>1.4. Set limits on session time</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By entering into a self-exclusion agreement with Tuskcasino, the player will be prevented from using his/her account for a definite or indefinite period. During this period of self-exclusion Tuskcasino will not distribute any promotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player needs a break from gambling at Tuskcasino he/she can ask for a cool down period. Once the player has requested a cool down period, he/she will receive a confirmation from Tuskcasino within 48 hours. In all cases, the player’s request will be complied with as soon as it is acknowledged by Tuskcasino</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player may also choose to impose a ceiling on the maximum wagers and losses he/she may make/incur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player may also choose to impose a time limit per session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that the player manually adjusts, or requests an adjustment to, his or her session limits (including limits on losses and wagers) or a period of self-exclusion:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.1. New session limits that are stricter than those previously imposed, or an extension of a period of self-exclusion, will take effect immediately from the time of adjustment.</p>
<p>6.2. New session imits that are more lenient than those previously imposed will only take effect after a seven-day cool down period from the time of adjustment.</p>
<p>6.3. A period of self-exclusion shall only be shortened after a seven –day cool down period, unless the existing self-exclusion period is due to end within that seven-day timeframe, in which case it shall remain unaltered.</p>
<p>6.2 specifically refers to more lenient limits taking effect after 7 days.</p>
<p>However according to support this does not apply to deposit limits, those are active instantly, regardless of the amount (why even offer limits if they can be overridden any time).</p>
<p>Support told me as much, now here is the thing that makes this seem so shady:</p>
<p>There is clearly a "pending limit" option.</p>
<p>Why is it there, if there is never any pending state for deposit limits?</p>
<p>Seems purposefully misleading.</p>
<p>Attached the email from support.</p>
