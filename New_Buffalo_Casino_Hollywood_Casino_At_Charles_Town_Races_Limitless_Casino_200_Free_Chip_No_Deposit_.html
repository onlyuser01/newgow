    <h1>New Buffalo Casino Hollywood Casino At Charles Town Races Limitless Casino 200 Free Chip No Deposit</h1>

<p>Kalamba Games has appointed a new head of product marketing in the face of Kai Botha who will be the latest addition to the supplier’s constantly growing team, as the company has experienced a rapid upscaling of its operations across the world.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Strengthens Management to Boost Commercial Results</p>
<p>Botha is an important addition all by himself as he has previously worked as head of growth and strategy at Skywind Group. He was in charge of managing a network of promotional campaigns that focused on tailored experiences for each partner.</p>
<p>He also has Microgaming under his belt where he worked as a games marketing manager and helped with the company’s digital media strategy. All in all, Botha has a solid grasp of the B2B iGaming industry and digital marketing campaigns and promotions. Botha will be able to contribute towards the company’s commercial growth and objectives. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby commented on this new appointment and said:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to welcome Kai as our latest appointment. We’re expanding across the board internally at the moment and his experience and skills will prove valuable to ensuring our content delivery grows alongside our investment in the right people. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby</p>
<p>Botha himself welcomed the opportunity to be joining the brand and company and said that the challenges he will face in the new positions were something that he cherished and looked forward to. “I relish solving business challenges using the technological, digital and strategic skills gained from years of experience in the industry and my new role is going to provide me with just that opportunity,” Botha wrapped up.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games recently appointed Marie Claire as its new finance director in October. In September, Kalamba Games partnered up with Bragg Gaming Group to roll out its products in Ontario.</p>
