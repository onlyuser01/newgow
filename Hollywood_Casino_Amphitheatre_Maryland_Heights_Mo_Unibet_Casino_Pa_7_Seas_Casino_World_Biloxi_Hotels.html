<p>China’s Anti-Corruption Drive Could Still Hurt Macau’s Economic Recovery, Market Analysts Warn</p>

<p>An anti-graft and corruption campaign in China has been ongoing for more than two years. For a while, the government in Beijing seemed to be focussing on casino junket operators in Macau, with sweeps that resulted in arrests of casino executives as well as junior-level employees.</p>

<p>The attention on casino marketers seems to have subsided, and since the last big bust, as casinos move away from a reliance on high-rollers, Macau’s economy seems to be getting healthy again. But according to investment brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein in a warning to investors, that rebounding economy remains vulnerable to the whims of Chinese authorities and President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>“There is no guarantee that the anti-corruption campaign continues to soften; it could intensify again,” the company told its clients in a memo this week. “We have repeatedly highlighted the [Chinese government’s] policy risks that can create headwinds for Macau’s gaming sector.”</p>
<p>Cautious Rebound</p>
<p>China’s anti-corruption drive, which kicked off in 2014, scared off many high-rollers who comprise Macau’s VIP segment with tightened controls on the junket industry that arranged their trips to China.</p>
<p>Analysts say the crackdown contributed to an economic slump in Macau that lasted for more than two years. Macau appeared to bottom out about a year ago, and has since enjoyed rising revenues for nine consecutive months through April.</p>
<p>In early May, Melco International chairman and CEO Lawrence Ho told shareholders that he believed Macau’s gaming industry would return to its 2013 peak size of $45 billion by 2022.</p>
<p>“The crackdown wasn’t really focused on gaming,” Ho explained. “It was focused on anti-corruption and anti-extravagance. Gaming, like all luxury sectors, was really just collateral damage.”</p>
<p>Ho said the worst impacts from the crackdown had passed.</p>
<p>“The middle class and wealthy individuals in China, who didn’t do anything wrong, have realized they’re in the clear, and can now go back to living upscale [lives] and having fun.”</p>
<p>About Face?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Macau has curbed in its reliance on the VIP sector that once accounted for some 60 percent of revenues and reinvented itself as a destination for the middle classes, largely with the support of Beijing.</p>
<p>But news earlier this month about ATM machines in Macau being retrofitted with face recognition technology gave China observers a pause. The technological upgrade suggested that Beijing still might have significant concerns about capital flight from the mainland and money laundering in Macau.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, the anti-corruption campaign appears to be moderating,” the Bernstein analysts said. “However, in March and April 2017, we noticed a small spike in anti-corruption related activity. It is too early to call this a new trend, but it could indicate slowing of the moderation, and may in fact be a pick-up in activity.”</p>
