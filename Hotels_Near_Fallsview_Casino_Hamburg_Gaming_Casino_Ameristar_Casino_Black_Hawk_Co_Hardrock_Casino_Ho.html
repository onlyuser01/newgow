<p>Subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals, Philp's appointment as chief people and culture officer will be effective from September 4, 2023</p>
<p>The New Zealand gaming and entertainment company, SkyCity Entertainment Group, announced a senior-level appointment. On Friday, the company confirmed it has selected human resources expert and proven leader, Shaun Philp, for the role of chief people and culture officer.</p>
<p>Although the appointment came this week, Philp will assume the new role starting on September 4, 2023. The company also explained that the senior-level appointment is subject to securing the relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Between March 27, 2023, and September 4, 2023, SkyCity’s general manager of employee services – people and culture Auckland, Greg McNair, will hold the role of acting chief people and culture officer. In other words, McNair will fill in the interim role until Philp’s appointment comes into effect.</p>
<p>“Pursuant to NZX Listing Rule 3.20.1(a), SkyCity Entertainment Group Limited is pleased to announce the appointment of Shaun Philp to the role of Chief People and Culture Officer effective from September 4, 2023, subject to obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals,“ reads a statement released by SkyCity</p>
<p>Philp Makes a Fine Addition to SkyCity’s Team</p>
<p>Overall, Philp has accumulated significant experience within the human resources vertical prior to his appointment with SkyCity. He provided strategic guidance and advice within different cultural transformations, while at the same time contributing to the implementation of successful business strategies as a part of leading financial services and telecommunications companies. This makes him an invaluable addition to SkyCity’s team of experts.</p>
<p>Before SkyCity, Philp held the role of chief people officer at Chorus New Zealand Limited. He held that position since 2017. His professional background includes senior-level roles with AMP New Zealand as general manager of human resources as well as other leading roles with companies in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after only recently, SkyCity appointed David Attenborough to the role of a non-executive director. The former Tabcorp managing director and chief executive officer delivered an extensive experience to the company after being a part of the gaming and hospitality sector for decades.</p>
