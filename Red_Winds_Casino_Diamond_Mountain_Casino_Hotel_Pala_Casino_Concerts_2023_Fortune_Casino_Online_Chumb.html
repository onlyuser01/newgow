    <h1>Red Winds Casino Diamond Mountain Casino Hotel Pala Casino Concerts 2023 Fortune Casino Online Chumb</h1>

<p>The B2B iGaming solutions provider Aspire Global has successfully met the requirements of the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Netherlands’ Gambling Authority, and will enter the newly-regulated Dutch gambling market.</p>
<p>Aspire Global Approved by the Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Aspire Global will be allowed to launch its iGaming solutions on the Dutch market and provide its sports betting and casino services to the KSA licensees.</p>
<p>The Netherlands launched its regulated gaming market last year and has since been very strict to operators and aggregators alike. The KSA is constantly fighting against illegally-operating gambling companies and fraud such as match-fixing and money laundering.</p>
<p>Because of this, Tsachi Maimon, the chief executive of Aspire Global, shared that he is thrilled that the company has met the KSA’s expectations. He called the Netherlands one of the most appealing iGaming markets, emphasizing its tremendously quick growth. Maimon elaborated that his team expects the Dutch iGaming market to continue growing and ultimately become one of the biggest in Europe. The CEO noted that this excites him even more.</p>
<p>Maimon concluded that he aspires to cement his company as one of the driving forces in Netherlands online gambling.</p>
<p>“Now, when our complete B2B offering is certified, we are ready to play a major role in shaping the Dutch market and to enhance the player experience also in the Dutch market.” Aspire Global CEO Tsachi Maimon</p>
<p>The B2B Company Aims to Conquer the Netherlands</p>
<p>As per the KOA Act, the Netherlands launched its regulated betting market on October 1, 2021. In just a few months, the Dutch market has become synonymous with success, with operators waiting in a line to receive a license. Currently, only 11 operators have been approved – ten of those got in at launch and the remaining one received a license on a later date. According to the KSA itself, the market’s income is expected to reach $1.6 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>Aspire Global had a presence in the Netherlands even before its official approval. The B2B company’s Pariplay brand has a deal with Holland Casino, a KSA licensee. Aspire’s proprietary BtoBet sportsbook was previously launched in the country when the Ireland-based gambling operator BoyleSports entered the market. Additionally, Lastly, Aspire Global has supported Karamba which also applied to enter the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Aspire Global had announced that it will be focusing on its B2B operations, after selling its B2C business beforehand. This proved to be a highly lucrative move as it streamlined the company’s operations and strengthened its focus. Thanks to this key decision, Aspire Global had remarkable 2021 results.</p>
