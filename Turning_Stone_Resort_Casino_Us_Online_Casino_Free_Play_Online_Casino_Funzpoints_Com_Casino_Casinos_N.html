    <h1>Turning Stone Resort Casino Us Online Casino Free Play Online Casino Funzpoints Com Casino Casinos N</h1>

<p>I have been a player since before October 2019 as far back as I looked today. I noticed the thousands and thousands of dollars I lost but once I was verified things seemed seamless. Since the beginning of 2021 I have won over a thousand dollars a couple times and many times between 100-500 dollars and not one single payout was honored. I finally learned after much effort on my part that I needed to validate my account again. As before, I sent the required information over and over and over for nearly five months and never get a response my email. I sift through my clutter and junk mail regularly and nothing. I wait on hold in their chat room and many times give up. I keep telling them I have sent the information but they wont let me know what else they need. The last time i was in chat I was told emails have been sent to me and after I demanded they be resent, she said she would do this and days later I still had nothing from her or them. When I request a withdrawl I try to let them know Im having problems with them and nearly beg them to call me by phone but I have not one call from them or voice mail.</p>
<p>I'm certain they have profited at least ten thousand dollars of my monies over the years and to be treated like this and never get a phone call or email or honest answer in their chat is over the top unacceptable. Many times I gave up and played the monies through and lost them back to the casino. Probably around 2-5 thousand dollars in monies I won and tried to get fair and square to no avail.</p>
<p>I decided i would never do that again and for two months have been struggling to get a mere 300 dollars placed into my payout account. I tried via bitcoin, via direct deposit and via fedex. All get denied without cause or reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps I accidently got blocked in email? I dont know, but if theres a reasonable explanation I want to know it. Who in their right mind would go through what im going through to get their monies and not do everything theyre asked to do.? Ive done my part</p>
<p>please help me get my 300 dollars.</p>
<p>This is my first effort at going to a third party to get this. I will be seeking any help I can get. This is wrong of them and in the past they were one of only three casinos with rtg I had confidence in and felt fairness and decent customer support.</p>
<p>Things change tho. They have no integrity as far as im concerned whatsoever at this point.</p>
