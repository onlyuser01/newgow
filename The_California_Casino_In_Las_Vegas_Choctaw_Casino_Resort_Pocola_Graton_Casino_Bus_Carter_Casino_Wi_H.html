    <h1>The California Casino In Las Vegas Choctaw Casino Resort Pocola Graton Casino Bus Carter Casino Wi H</h1>

<p>The leading gaming operator, the Muscogee Nation Gaming Enterprises, revealed that it has expanded its collaboration with the creators of the only AI-based gun detection video analytics platform that has a Safety Act Designation from the US Department of Homeland Security, ZeroEyes. Announced last week, the collaboration sees the deployment of the solution to all gaming properties of the Muscogee Nation Gaming Enterprises.</p>
<p>The recent launch follows an initial collaboration between the duo dating back to October last year. Back then, ZeroEyes deployed the solution at the River Spirit Casino, the operator's flagship location. In light of the early success of the solution, it will now be deployed across more Muscogee Nation Gaming properties.</p>
<p>ZeroEyes' CEO and co-founder, Mike Lahiff, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement. "We are honored to expand our partnership with Muscogee Nation Gaming Enterprises and further support its mission to enhance the safety and security of its properties," he said. Finally, Lahiff pointed out: "It is gratifying to see a company so driven to proactively protect its employees and guests against gun-related violence, and we remain steadfast in our shared goal of saving lives."</p>
<p>Currently, ZeroEyes offers unique software that can be used by digital cameras in different venues such as gaming properties. It allows the identification of illegally brandished guns. Once such a gun is detected, its image is immediately shared with a group of experts with backgrounds within US law enforcement and the military sector, allowing further analysis.</p>
<p>Such images are analyzed by ZeroEyes Operation Centers (ZOC) which operate 24/7/365, enabling experts with extensive experience to verify if the threat is legitimate and send an alert. Such alerts can include vital information regarding the gun type, visual description, as well as the last known location of the individual that is intercepted. Alerts can be disseminated to the gaming venue's security team and law enforcement in the area for as fast as 3 to 5 seconds upon the initial detection.</p>
<p>Leveraging such supreme technology complements Muscogee Nation Gaming Enterprises' efforts to ensure the safety of all of its gaming locations. At the same time, only recently, the operator organized extensive active shooter educational training programs at its properties around Oklahoma. Now, ZeroEyes' technology will further supercharge the security efforts of the operator, allowing it to benefit from early gun detection and fast response if critical situations occur.</p>
<p>Travis Thompson, River Spirit Casino's director of compliance, commented on the topic saying: "Our primary concern is the safety of our patrons and employees, and the early detection and efficient communication provided by ZeroEyes plays a critical role." He explained that after one venue has seen the effectiveness of this innovative technology, it was only a matter of time before it expands to more locations. "We prioritize situational awareness as the most effective approach to ensuring safety, and ZeroEyes plays a vital role, empowering our employees to be prepared and ensure that, in the instance of a threat, our patrons are swiftly guided to safety," explained Thompson in conclusion.</p>
