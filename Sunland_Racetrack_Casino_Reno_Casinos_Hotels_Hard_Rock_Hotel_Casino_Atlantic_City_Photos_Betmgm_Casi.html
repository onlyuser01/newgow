<p>Leading sports technology company Genius Sports announced it expanded its low latency live data capabilities for globally recognized football competitions thanks to a new partnership with the data rights holder of UK football, Football DataCo. Under the terms of a new deal announced last week, Genius Sports extended its partnership with the data rights holder.</p>
<p>As a result, the company was designated as Football DataCo's exclusive official supplier of low-latency live data for the global betting industry. This collaboration enabled Genius to gain access to live data from the English Football League (EFL), English Premier League (EPL), as well as Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL).</p>
<p>Since 2019, Genius Sports has been an exclusive distributor of low-latency official data for more than 4,000 UK football fixtures per season, powering hundreds of betting operators around the globe. Now, the new deal with Football DataCo helps further expand this coverage and will run through the end of the 2024-2025 season, a statement released by Genius Sports reveals.</p>
<p>Mark Locke, Genius Sports' CEO, shared his excitement about the new partnership saying: "The Premier League is the most popular league in world sport and Genius Sports has created the fastest, most accurate and secure feed on UK football to power first-class products for sportsbooks around the world."</p>
<p>Finally, Locke pointed out: "We are delighted to extend our partnership to continue to power innovation and now to expand it to include our suite of AI-powered Second Spectrum Tracking Data technology for the EFL Championship as well as the Premier League."</p>
<p>Besides being the official tracking data and analytics partner of the EPL, Genius Sports will also be able to capture sub-second, skeletal tracking data for competitions such as Sky Bet EFL Championship, as well as Championship Play-off matches. This will be achieved via the company's Second Spectrum technology. The company will position its AI-powered tracking systems on all remaining Championship grounds, allowing it to capture such data.</p>
<p>Adrian Ford, Football DataCo's General Manager, was excited about the new collaboration. "Genius Sports and Second Spectrum continue to generate first-class data and provide innovative solutions for a variety of Football DataCo's stakeholders," he said. Finally, Ford pointed out: "The technology is improving all the time, extending the creative use of data to improve the presentation of English and Scottish football."</p>
<p>Recently, Genius Sports strengthened its data collection for the Canadian Football League (CFL). Announced in mid-May, the collaboration with the CFL came just in time for the launch of the 2023 season.</p>
