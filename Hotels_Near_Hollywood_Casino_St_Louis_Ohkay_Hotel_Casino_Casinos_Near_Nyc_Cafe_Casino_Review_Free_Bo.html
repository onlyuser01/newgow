<p>Borgata, Hard Rock, and Ocean Dominating Atlantic City, as Other Casinos Struggle</p>

<p>For many months, the Borgata, Hard Rock, and Ocean casinos in Atlantic City have been the market’s leaders. But with COVID-19’s darkest and most restrictive days seemingly behind the nation, the three casinos have only increased their dominance in the New Jersey beach town.</p>

<p>Numbers released yesterday from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) reveal that the three properties continue increasing their grip on the Atlantic City gaming industry.</p>
<p>Brick-and-mortar gross gaming revenue (GGR) at the nine casinos in July totaled just shy of $299 million. That is an 8% improvement on July 2021, and 7.9% better than pre-pandemic July 2019.</p>
<p>Last month was the best July for Atlantic City casinos in more than a decade. Slot machines accounted for more than $215.8 million — up 5.5% year-over-year — while table games accounted for $83.1 million. Tables won 15% more money than they did in July 2021.</p>
<p>Strong Numbers</p>
<p>While the headlines read well for Atlantic City’s gaming industry — GGR up 8% in July 2022 — there is much more to the story. If it weren’t for Borgata, Hard Rock, and Ocean, the industry picture would be far from cheery.</p>
<p>Borgata continues to rule Atlantic City, the MGM Resorts-operated property winning more than $76.7 million last month on its physical gaming floor. The Marina District casino won 20% more money from gamblers year-over-year.</p>
<p>Hard Rock won almost $52.9 million — up about 11%. Ocean made the biggest gain, as the north Boardwalk casino won $40.3 million, 33% better than the previous July.</p>
<p>Combined, the three casinos won approximately $169.9 million — or about 57% of the market’s land-based July win.</p>
<p>Four Casinos Struggle</p>
<p>Four other casinos reported year-over-year GGR declines. Tropicana won $28 million, down 5.5%, Harrah’s $26.4 million, down 9%, Caesars $25.1 million, down 3.3%, and Golden Nugget $14.5 million, a loss of nearly 7%.</p>
<p>Bally’s experienced a 3.5% increase in GGR to $16.8 million. Bally’s faced an easy comparison, as the casino was amid a substantial renovation in July 2021 and was not operating at full capacity.</p>
<p>The July GGR report shows that the three leaders are extending their control.</p>
<p>In full-year 2021, Borgata, Hard Rock, and Ocean combined to win about $1.34 billion. Atlantic City’s nine casinos won $2.55 billion, meaning the three leaders accounted for 52.5% of the land-based win.</p>
<p>Through seven months of 2022, the three leaders account for more than 56% of the brick-and-mortar income.</p>
<p>Industry Continues Growth</p>
<p>Paired with iGaming and sports betting, New Jersey’s gaming industry — the second-richest in the country behind Nevada — continues to enlarge. Online casinos won $136.7 million — up 15% — while oddsmakers kept $45 million of the bets wagered.</p>
<p>July GGR from all verticals, including online poker, totaled nearly $480.7 million. That’s a 6.7% premium on July 2021.</p>
<p>Though July was a miss for four casinos, New Jersey Casino Control Commission Chair James Plousis pointed to the fact that all nine casinos have fared better in 2022 than 2021 through July.</p>
<p>Casino win reached its highest level for the month of July in a decade, reflecting the strength of Atlantic City as a gaming and leisure destination. Year-to-date, every casino hotel has surpassed its casino win, internet gaming win, and total gaming revenue compared to the same period last year,” Plousis summarized.</p>
<p>“This summer, more than ever before, I’ve witnessed first-hand how hard the casino hotels and their dedicated employees have been working to provide exciting and memorable experiences for their guests,” the CCC chair added.</p>
