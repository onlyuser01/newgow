    <h1>Are There Casinos In Hawaii Palm Springs Casinos Casino Real Station Casinos Bingo Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>Disgusted with this service. You seem to literally agree with the caisnos even in the face of them attempting theft and borderline criminal activities....I know you do not want to harm your CPAs or revshare deals but the handling of this complaint is laughable.</p>
<p>I want a manager to take over this complaint now as you are simply wasting my time and we are going around in circles.</p>
<p>Therefore your stance on this in terms of your fair gaming codex should be the money sent to me and account closed. It cannot be one rule for one casino and another rule for another casino.</p>
<p>As Casino guru have already quoted to me 'The problem is that every casino has a right to close the player account anytime. (they need to send the remaining balance back, of course) In your case, this happened ' - Matej Novota. -</p>
<p>The casino is aware i do not have the facitilites for a video call but will offer a phone call on my second line.</p>
<p>I have gambled for 10 years and have never had to send SO MANY THINGS. THIS IS NOT USUAL as you have tried to lie about above. Everything that has been sent is of 1080 hd quality. I have also offered to send other things and as is blatantly obvious has bent over backwards to try and get this verified.</p>
<p>A 400 euro withdrawal was processed before any of the above was provided.</p>
<p>I also offered to send PDF POAs of my internet etc.</p>
<p>I also offered to send a picture holding a local paper that I am unable to cancel.</p>
<p>X2 Posted proof of address documents (Utility Bills my bank accepted and a loan company....)(THIS IS ALL I HAVE)</p>
<p>x2 Selfies holding my passport and one holding a handwritten note with my email written on it (*I was told this would be the last thing required to complete KYC- LIE)</p>
<p>I request a manager contact me now and take over this complaint as I appear to be dealing with a casino apologist and no amount of evidence proving I am right or the casino is acting unlawfully seems to sway you in. In fact you seem to be blatantly ignoring any facts that prove the casino is wrong:</p>
<p>I am right and your responses are incredibly inappropriate and show a complete lack of understanding of the issue at hand and/or intelligence on your part.</p>

<p>X2 Posted proof of address documents (Utility Bills my bank accepted and a loan company....)(THIS IS ALL I HAVE)</p>
<p>x 2 Front and back of my bank card</p>
