<p>SOFTSWISS is continuing to expand its regional footprint as the company is poised to tap into the pent-up demand for quality solutions to power local gaming and sports wagering. To this end, the company has picked Carla Dualib as the company’s regional business development manager for Latin America.</p>

<p>She is an experienced sales, marketing, and communications executive which makes her a strong fit for the new position in the market. As the company’s newest manager, she will be at the helm of business development and engage in strategic negotiations. Dualib will also seek to establish robust collaborations and strengthen existing ties with local partners.</p>
<p>Dualib will also tour local events and seek to promote the SOFTSWISS’ good name and increase brand recognition as she leverages her deeper understanding of the industry and the local market’s particularities.</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Dualib said that she was very excited to be joining this new position and be one of the go-to people for the company’s growth in Latin America. Dualib added:</p>
<p>Brazil presents tremendous growth opportunities, and I am committed to leveraging my expertise to drive innovation and deliver SOFTSWISS’ top-notch iGaming solutions to our clients in the region. SOFTSWISS’ Carla Dualib</p>
<p>She said that with SOFTSWISS’ ongoing efforts in Latin America, and with Brazil’s fast-evolving iGaming ecosystem, the company now has a great opportunity to achieve new milestones, strengthen its local partners, and generally continue to grow its own presence in the region.</p>

<p>Recently, the company announced a new server infrastructure which was deployed in the region to bolster the SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator, which has been supplying local partners with a rich library of third-party games.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new infrastructure, SOFTSWISS is capable of ensuring that the iGaming experience for partners in the region goes smoothly and without any interruptions.
