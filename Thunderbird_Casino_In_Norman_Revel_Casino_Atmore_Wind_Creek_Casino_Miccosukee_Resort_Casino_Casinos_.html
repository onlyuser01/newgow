<p>Two men were charged with offering bribes for HK$1.5 million ($190,000) by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in Hong Kong, China. The men allegedly offered to bribe a former Wynn Macau director for air-conditioning maintenance contracts.</p>
<p>Two Men Face Criminal Charges, Offered to Bribe Wynn Macau Director</p>
<p>The ICAC launched an investigation after it received a complaint of corruption. While the investigation is still ongoing, the anti-corruption authority announced Monday that it charged two men last Friday who allegedly offered bribes to a former director of the hotel group.</p>
<p>“Li Kin-wang, 58, senior sales manager of Oh Luen Air-conditioning Equipment Limited (Oh Luen), faces seven counts of offering advantage to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO),” reads a statement released by the ICAC</p>
<p>According to the ICAC, Li Kin-wang, 58, faces seven charges for bribes. Kin-wang used to be a senior sales manager for Oh Luen Air-conditioning Equipment Limited (Oh Luen). Kin-wang and Woo Tak-hoi, 55, who was a director of Wai Luen Air-conditioning Limited (Wai Luen), are jointly facing two charges of conspiracy to offer advantages. The described criminal charges breach the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) Section 9(2)(a) and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance.</p>
<p>“Li and Woo Tak-hoi, 55, then director of Wai Luen Air-conditioning Limited (Wai Luen), jointly face two counts of conspiracy to offer advantages to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2)(a) of the POBO and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance,” explained the ICAC</p>
<p>The ICAC said that the alleged offenses were completed between June 2014 and January 2017. Citing its investigation, the anti-corruption authority said that between 2014 and 2017, Wynn awarded more than 70 air-conditioning maintenance contracts, which were estimated at HK$22 million ($2.8 million) to Oh Luen Air-conditioning Equipment Limited.</p>
<p>The Men Were Released on Bail</p>
<p>The recent charges allege that Li Kin-wang, while a part of Oh Luen, offered bribes to a former Wynn director. The seven bribes totaled more than HK$930,000 ($118,000), the charges allege. Ultimately, the ICAC claims Kin-wang sought to bribe Wynn’s director to consider quotations or tenders submitted by Oh Luen for air-conditioning maintenance services.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the two other charges against Kin-wang and Tak-hoi allege the duo conspired to bribes for a total of HK$560,000 ($71,000). Those charges claim that the bribes targeted the same director at Wynn.</p>
<p>Both Kin-wang and Tak-hoi were released on bail. The duo is expected to appear this Thursday, May 19, 2022, in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts. Wynn Resorts as well as the Macau Commission Against Corruption collaborated with the ICAC during the investigation of the case.</p>
