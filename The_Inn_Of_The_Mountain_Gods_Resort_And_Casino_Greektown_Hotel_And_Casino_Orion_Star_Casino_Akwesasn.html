<p>Jammin' Jars 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Jammin' Jars 2 is themed around a disco party filled with tropical fruit and jam.</p>
<p>Players will arrive at a neon-lit club and discover an array of tempting produce. As the palm trees sway, they’ll get their groove on with a jar wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p>This whimsical world of jam is a good fit for fans of fruit machine themes and those looking for a lighthearted atmosphere.</p>
<p>Big win in the Jammin' Jars2 slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack adds a festive vibe with plenty of percussion notes. It may become repetitive for some players, but the mute button is readily at hand if needed.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see a plethora of colourful fruits from purple grapes to golden pineapples to pink plums. Each dainty fruit is accented with droplets of water, emphasizing its freshness.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, a personified jar bounces at the DJ station, his sunglasses and headphones giving him an edgy look. He smiles as players spin, looking cartoonishly adorable in the process.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, there is a disco scene, with neon fruit shapes adorning the walls and floor. On each side, tall palm trees suggest that this is a warm party city.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music create a playful party vibe.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Jammin' Jars 2 has eight rows and eight reels. Wins are awarded when players land a minimum of 5 matching symbols that connect horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>Due to the Cascade feature, symbols that form winning combinations vanish, allowing new symbols to fall into the new positions.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>If a Wild is part of a winning combination, it will jump into open, adjacent positions before the Cascade begins. The Wild then remains in place during the Cascade, increasing its chances of becoming part of another winning combination.</p>
<p>Each Wild that is part of a winning cluster adds its current multiplier to the total win, including the Instant Prize wins</p>
<p>The multipliers that accompany Wild symbols increase each time Wilds are part of a winning combination. These multipliers begin at 1x and increase by +1 for each win.</p>
<p>Wild symbols are also Scatter symbols, triggering the Free Spins feature if players land 3 or more Scatters. The Free Spins feature begins with 6 free spins.</p>
<p>When players hit a minimum of 5 Instant Prize symbols in a cluster, all the prizes are added up and awarded to the player.</p>
<p>The Fruit Blast feature is triggered at random and triggers a minimum of one Giant Fruit symbol to appear on the reels (and/or a Giant Instant Prize symbol). The positions covered by the Giant Fruit symbol or symbols are transformed into matching symbols. All symbols covered by the Giant Instant Prize symbol are transformed into Instant Prize symbols.</p>
<p>Win with Wild symbols in the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>The Gold Vinyl symbol is collected by the player and leaves a randomly selected paying symbol in its place. If players fill the Giga Jar (which sits beside the reels) entirely with Gold Vinyl symbols, they may trigger the Giga Jar feature.</p>
<p>When the Giga Jar feature begins, any symbols on the reels are taken away, and Wild symbols are added. The Giga Jar is then added to the reels, creating an Instant Prize symbol block.</p>
<p>The Giga Jar feature starts with 8 spins, and each position spins with a chance to hit an Instant Prize symbol. Further spins can be triggered by landing an Instant Prize symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.4%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Jammin' Jars 2 slot</p>
