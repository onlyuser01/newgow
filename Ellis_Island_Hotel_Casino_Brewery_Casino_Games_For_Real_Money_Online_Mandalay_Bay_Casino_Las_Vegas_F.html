    <h1>Ellis Island Hotel Casino Brewery Casino Games For Real Money Online Mandalay Bay Casino Las Vegas F</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>this account verification can be a very challenging process and in order to get your winnings, you simply have to pass it. The whole point is that the casino must be 100% sure it's has been you who deposited the initial money, that you provide correct and truthful information during the registration and that it's you who played and won.</p>
<p>Please go through all emails associated with the account verification and check whether you sent all required documents in the proper format (.pdf preferably, no screenshots, and so on) if it's available check your account whether there is some list of approved documents, so you can be sure that you did not accidentally confused let's say electricity bill with the bank statement. It's also important to understand what the casino needs and what are specifics, if you are not sure keep asking the staff. If you overwhelm them with documents that are not necessary or have been already submitted, you're just wasting time.</p>
<p>So just try to get a better understanding of what is missing at the moment. In which language do you communicate with the casino? It can happen that you may be mistaken about some request because the casino staff finds it difficult to explain in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you get completely lost, we will try to help you via complaint.</p>
<p>But I'd like to ask you kindly to go through the documents again to make sure that everything is correct at your end.</p>
