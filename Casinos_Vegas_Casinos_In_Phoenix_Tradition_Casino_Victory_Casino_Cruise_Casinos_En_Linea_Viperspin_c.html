    <h1>Casinos Vegas Casinos In Phoenix Tradition Casino Victory Casino Cruise Casinos En Linea Viperspin c</h1>

<p>the process has moved a step and yesterday after me having to beg them to process my withdrawal once i saw someone from Viper spin writting on here that I am able to make withdrawals I had to wait for wednesday 10:30 am for them to process my payment telling me i am lucky as hey are doing it once off for me, this is such an roberry when the casino can get to make the rules and change the way they pay people out.</p>
<p>and as of for the reply by them I did ask for sponsorship and I just started streaming 2 months ago and 2 viewers max per stream is again another lie by them, have I asked for sponsorship and what it takes to become affiliate YES i did but thats because i saw that i can get people attention and also since i am from australia and online gaming is kinda ass here me finiding the right casino for australian people is a very big plus for Viper.spin. I have asked for code like stake would give out as i told them i have number of peopleasking where i play on so whats the point of me reffering people to viperspin casino without me at least having an sign up code which of course they refused, I spent 38k of my own money in just over a year of having account and my weekly withdrawal limit was at first 3200 and for 38 k of my own money they have increased ,y withdrawing limit only once and been ignoring that question ever since.</p>
<p>this is online casino guru not a place where casino reps come to speak bad about players, I am happpy for them to share whatever it is that they might think is in their benefit, but i can tell you I am not complainer I streamed and I decided to start doing it fulll time but these people unless you are already established with over 10k viewers they wont support you in any way, where with stake i was able to obtain the signup code based only of my kick.com account activity, where i am doing over 180 hours a month streaming gambling.</p>
<p>so its for you to make decision, yesterday when i told them to please process my payment ASAP so tha i can get it before weeekend and newyears, as i told them last week they processed my payments on wednesday afternoon and i had money in my bank account on thursday next day, you know what htey said to me? YOU ARE VERY LUCKY, that was their response to me trying to be polite and get them to process my request once someone from Viperspin has said on here that i will be able to do withdrawal and it wil be done ASAP.</p>
<p>I did have numerous of times of going back and fourth with them and but it was never to this point, also you can see on my first post that i said I havent had anyproblem with viperspin in over a year of having account until today, so I am clean towards them, there is no reason they should of cancelled my original withdrawing requests as its Thursday and its 10:09 pm here last week 8 hours ago I have already beeen paid by them, and this week we are entering friday now and they tried to tell me I exceeded my limit in withdrawing.</p>
<p>I am not an idiot and i know how things work I have knowladge and I read about things i take interest in. They saw I won 10k from 180, first withdrawal went smooth as hell, but than once i didnt use my account for a week and i waited 7 days to make requests again and than they cancel it for a lie reason that is very upsetting and especially once we are approaching holidays season and when having etra 4200 would mean a world to my daughter. I am sorry for making they loud noises but I still havent been paid even tho 7 days and 8 hours ago i have been paid 4200 first time, now I am praying to God that my money lends into my bank account by end of tomorrow which if it doesnt weekend is coming here and I am stuck with no extra 4200 that i should of already had cause I have timed everything to perfection.</p>
