    <h1>St Louis Casinos Hotels Atlantic City Casinos Hard Rock Casino In Fort Lauderdale Fort Randall Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>We appreciate the time your Team took to look over a case and defend a player who is in no way interested or responsive on the matter. At the same time our Team made sure to provide the best and fairest possible explanation after extremely huge efforts we put into improving our system based on the issues and shortcomings we have faced before. And isn't this the point of your work?</p>
<p>It almost seems that your Team is more prone to defending rule breakers and players who exploit weaknesses of Casinos but is not here to actually help and improve the mutual environment where good players can play in fair casinos and everyone follows rules. Yes, we read your rules and they are not fair.</p>
<p>We understand that you will probably not decide to publish our response but we will appreciate if you want to be transparent about your communication.</p>
<p>We have been very honest and fair with all our players but being in the industry for a long time, we are experienced enough to not allow unfair exploitation and stop it on time regardless if this will be considered "Bad reputation". For your audience - yes, but for other players maybe ours will be the right Casino to go to. We are, in fact, known for our outstanding Customer Support and rule following. We always deliver what we have promised.</p>
<p>We are sad that we could not find a partner in your Team in the effort to create a better Casino environment but if the price to pay is to enable toxic behavior, we can live with the label "Very bad reputation"</p>
<p>"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"</p>
<p>Cosmoswin Team</p>
