    <h1>Omaha Casino Online Casino Texas Casino Monticello Ny Online Usa Casino Casinos In New York State Sk</h1>

<p>Ive requested withdrawl of $4000 on 5th August which got approved by the casino. The website terms and conditions say payment will be in my account within 1-7 days which is not the case. I contact them everyday via chat and email and keep getting the response " your funds has been transferred from our end and there is problem at your bank" it's been 8 days and still no signs of funds. When I ask them to send track of payment(sender bank statement) they refused to send the proof of transaction made by them. They expect players to abide by terms and condition yet they can't even abide by them.</p>
<p>I request you to help me with this.</p>
