<p>The advertising rights arrangement is one of the multiple benefits of Entain’s takeover, Paweł Rabantek said</p>
<p>Polish-facing sports betting brand STS has secured an advertising rights arrangement with the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Now owned by Entain, the operator has secured the right to conduct marketing activities for the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Europa Conference League in Poland.</p>
<p>This will expand the sports sector presence of Entain, which already partners with the two leagues in question. With Entain having acquired STS, the Polish brand will also be able to conduct UEFA-oriented campaigns.</p>
<p>Now activated by STS in Poland, the rights will allow the Polish operator to appeal to soccer fans across Europe. The operator’s logo will be visible during matches of Polish teams, promoting its wagering products.</p>
<p>At the same time, STS promised to launch a variety of local promotions for sports fans in the country. Lucky fans will even be able to win tickets for some of the hottest European soccer matches.</p>
<p>As the largest private operator in Poland, STS is firmly committed to supporting the sports sector. Already boasting partnerships with many clubs across multiple sports, the operator is also the official sponsor of Poland’s national soccer team.</p>
<p>Entain’s Takeover Continues to Benefit STS</p>
<p>STS’ chief marketing officer, Paweł Rabantek, commented on the activation of the advertising rights. According to him, the recent takeover by Entain brings a “number of benefits” for his team, including the opportunity to expand STS’ marketing activities and reinforce its position in Poland’s gambling market.</p>
<p>Rabantek also expressed his happiness about the implementation of all possible advertising services both within the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League competitions from the first match day.</p>
<p>Rabantek teased that fans can expect many exciting promotions.</p>
<p>STS Dominates the Polish Market</p>
<p>STS was acquired by Entain in June for approximately $945 million. Approved by STS’ two major shareholders, Mateusz Juroszek and Zbigniew Juroszek, the deal saw STS join the global Entain family.</p>
<p>Currently boasting around 800,000 active users and a network of 400+ physical betting shops, STS is an undisputed leader in the Polish gaming industry.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the gambling and betting company published its results for the first half of the year, strengthening its leadership position and maintaining its momentum. The company’s metrics increased across the board, attesting to the effectiveness of STS’ strategy.</p>
<p>In other news, PandaScore just debuted in Poland thanks to a partnership with the local betting leader. Under the deal, the former company supplied its cutting-edge esports betting products to STS.</p>
