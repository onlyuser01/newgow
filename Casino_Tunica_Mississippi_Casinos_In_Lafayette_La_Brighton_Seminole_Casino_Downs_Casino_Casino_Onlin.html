    <h1>Casino Tunica Mississippi Casinos In Lafayette La Brighton Seminole Casino Downs Casino Casino Onlin</h1>

<p>Hello good evening Branislav</p>
<p>I summarize what happened because it seems that Mystake casino does not want to take responsibility for everything that happened and they want to take away the balance I had in my account to withdraw.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am not going to be doing all this if it were not true nor am I going to be taking the time to do something that is not, I have all the good intentions since I am Claiming what I win Cleanly in this casino with money that I myself deposited in my casino account, I am fully aware and I know perfectly well the balance that had been left in my account, disputed amounts of $5,400,000 million Argentine pesos, the same casino told me that as of 12/15/23 I would be able to withdraw the money I There was in my account until that moment everything seemed understandable to me.</p>
<p>When I want to log back into my casino account on a certain date, it won't let me log in because I honestly don't know. From there I tried to contact Mystake Support by email and they did not give me a response until today. I am looking for help on Telegram since the casino has a Telegram group and you can enter from the mystake casino page. I contact the advisor. Telegram, I explain what happened and he starts to verify after a while he tells me that my account was blocked for violating the terms and conditions that they couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>After a few days they contacted me again by telegram telling me that if I wanted to have access to my account again I had to pay a sum of $1000 usd for cryptocurrencies, once I paid the fee my account was going to be reopened with $5,500 usd</p>
<p>I mean, instead of giving me a solution, they wanted to get more money from me. How could this be possible, I tried to find another solution since the treatment they wanted to give me was not at all reliable.</p>
<p>I contacted the live chat, explained what happened and they told me to send an email to KyC Mystake, they contacted me by email and they told me that they reopened my account so I could withdraw the balance I had, from there I entered my casino account. and I see that the amounts I had to withdraw were not</p>
<p>I contact KyC again and they tell me to send an email to Mystake Support, gentlemen. Mystake Support never answers the emails. How can this be possible, so there is no type of communication with this casino.</p>
<p>The casino must take care of this because then if I don't use my account for a whole month, they can appropriate the Deposits and Profits from the players' accounts. I can invent any excuse to not give the corresponding balances.</p>
<p>I HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE.</p>
<p>ALL THE EVIDENCE, GENTLEMEN, CAPTURES OF THE TRANSACTIONS, CAPTURES OF WHAT I SENT AND SPOKE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ALSO OF ALL THE MESSAGES I SPOKE ON TELEGRAM AND LIVE CHATS, CAPTURES OF THE PROFITS OBTAINED AND DEPOSITS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING FOR THE CASINO TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS IT HAPPENS AND THEY ARE NOT INVENTING UNNECESSARY EXCUSES.</p>
