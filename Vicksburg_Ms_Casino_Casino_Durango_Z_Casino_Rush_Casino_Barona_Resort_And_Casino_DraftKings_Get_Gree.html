<p>Wild Rose Entertainment commence partnership with DraftKings, allowing the latter to step in the newly regulated sports betting market in Iowa</p>
<p>The recent start of the regulated sports betting market in Iowa already houses more than a few competitors for just over a week after the first sports bet was made on state territory</p>
<p>CEO of Wild Rose shares his thoughts on the promising opportunities of the partnership</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to be the first Iowa casino company to partner with DraftKings, which we view as the most recognisable name in sports gaming. With [their] track record in mobile betting, we can reach more fans and customers who love sports. We can’t wait to be up and running” said Tom Timmons, the president of Wild Rose Entertainment.</p>
<p>A New Kind of Rose for Iowa</p>
<p>Just as of recently, Iowa became the 11th state to legalize sports betting, having the final step towards launching the various means for access to the regulated sports betting market just about a week ago. It is also noteworthy due to the fact that it’s the first and only state that incorporated online options alongside with brick-and-mortar sportsbooks from the very start.</p>
<p>Operators have already stormed the terrain. William Hill has partnered with quite the few casino properties, among which Isle Bettendorf, Isle Waterloo, Lakeside and Prairie Meadows, having also debuted their Android platform for Iowans.</p>
<p>But the new dawn brings news of another giant among sportsbook operators, stepping in on the scene in Iowa. Just yesterday, August 22nd, the approval from the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission was confirmed that Wild Rose is partnering up with DraftKings and in development of quite the treat for Iowan punters. The agreement allows DraftKings to operate sportsbook properties at Clinton, Emmetsburg and Jefferson.</p>
<p>Under the conditions of the Iowan sports betting legislation, each licensed casino operator has the right to be an applicant for a sports betting license and that license allows for the casino to collaborate with two partners, which would operate “skins” under the licensee.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy – especially for Iowans – element of the new legislation is that users will be required to register officially in a land-based casino in order to be granted access to online mobile betting. This will be valid at least until the end of 2020, after which users can proceed directly with online registration.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems Wild Rose haven’t been wasting any time, as they presented a solid, reasoned decision for their partner of choice, which comes as the result of a diligent market study, which started way back in May, when the state’s sports betting legislature was first enacted.</p>
<p>The Reign of the DraftKings</p>
<p>These news come just after the announcement of DraftKings’ strengthened New Jersey partnership with the sportsbook solutions developer, Kambi. The latter has played a key role in the American daily fantasy sports media sportsbook development. This extended relationship promises further enticement for enthusiastic punters in the years to come and looks to spread a quality user express across more than 8 states.</p>
