    <h1>Jackpot Casino Casino Near Palm Springs Seneca Allegheny Casino Oaklawn Casino Hot Springs Arkansas</h1>

<p>Good day. I am currently testing a number of casinos and also a number of dispute resolution platforms.</p>
<p>I signed up at this casino yesterday because I read on Casino-Guru that this casino is very good. And it accepts players from Austria. After making several deposits and not winning once, I've been wondering and wondering if the RNG might be rigged. Also, I deposited with euros within 30 hours and I can't afford that at all because I earn €800 a month. I am currently in bankruptcy proceedings due to my gambling addiction. Now I have found that the casino does not have a valid license for Austria. On the one hand I would have liked some casino guru to take responsibility for this false information and on the other hand I would have liked the casino to refund 100% of the deposits because the basic transaction did not come about due to illegality. According to the settled case law of the European Court of Justice and the Supreme Court of Austria, this transaction is invalid and must be reversed.</p>
<p>In addition, Austrian law stipulates a maximum deposit of €800 per week, €4000 in 30 hours does not really correspond to a functioning system of player protection and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>I therefore politely ask you to do your name justice and to deal with this complaint positively in my interest.</p>
