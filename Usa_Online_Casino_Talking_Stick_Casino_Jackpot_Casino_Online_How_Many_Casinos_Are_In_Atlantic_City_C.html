<p>As per a new government order, a total of 487 betting shops, over half of the country’s total, will have to shut down in 11 council areas until at least December 11.</p>
<p>Scottish Betting Shops to Shut Down on Friday</p>
<p>Scotland will move in deeper into the lockdown caused by the spread of covid-19 and order 487 betting shops to shut down on Friday, November 20 throughout the country. A total of 11 council areas will be impacted, as they currently have the highest incidence of covid-19 infections. In other words, over half of all betting shops in Scotland will have to shut down.</p>
<p>With this, all non-essential businesses will suspend operation as per Level 4 regulations that will remain in place until at least December 11. The only exemption therein is the continuation of professional sports which will be unaffected for the time being.</p>
<p>Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the government was following through with public health experts’ advice. In order to slow down the spread of the disease in the hardest-hit areas, tougher measures must be taken, she said. Sturgeon did not rule out harder measures.</p>
<p>Betting Shops Need Not Close, Says BGC</p>
<p>Understandably, the news was not welcome with a cheer from the industry. The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) commented that it fully supported the Scottish government in its fight against covid-19.</p>
<p>However, BGC felt that there was no need to proceed with full-blown closures on betting shops, which are venues that are well-equipped to tackle covid-19 on their own premises.</p>
<p>“We hope that the shops will be able to re-open as soon as possible so they can go back to contributing to the economy,” a BGC spokesperson has said. While closures are usually quick to enact, one issue bookmakers have been upset with is the lack of consistent financial aid.</p>
<p>According to Scotbet chairman John Heaton, financial support has been lacking with the bulk of all government aid focused on England and not Scotland. Meanwhile, uncertainty over casinos continues.</p>
<p>Sturgeon allowed casinos to reopen back on August 24, with all brands advocating for a more pro-active approach towards the pandemic which allows operators to remain open because of state-of-the-art safety and sanitization measures.</p>
