<p>The Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) is expanding its Board of Directors following its Annual General Meeting on November 10, 2021, when the Board decided to appoint four new directors, the CGA announced today.</p>
<p>‘Testament to Exponential Growth’</p>
<p>The CGA’s Board of Directors added Scott Burton, chief executive officer of FansUnite Entertainment, Neil Erlick, chief corporate development officer at Nuvei, Jeffrey Haas, Senior Vice President for International Strategy at DraftKings, and Chuck Keeling, Executive Vice President for Stakeholder Relations and Responsible Gaming at Great Canadian Gaming Corporation.</p>
<p>These seasoned professionals have strong track records as trusted leaders in the gaming industry, and they will provide invaluable insight as we look to launch a regulated iGaming market in Ontario and single-event sports betting across Canada.” Paul Burns, President and CEO of the CGA</p>
<p>The addition of four new members was hailed as “a testament to the Association’s exponential growth in 2021” by CGA Chair Carrie Kormos, who outlined some of the achievements of the industry representative body, including the addition of 18 new members to diversify with sports and esports betting operators, payment companies and non-gaming suppliers to help fulfill its role “as a conveyer for the industry.”</p>
<p>Meet the New Directors</p>
<p>A Chartered Professional Accountant with more than two decades of experience in gambling operations and one of the pioneers in esports, FansUnite CEO Burton is responsible for overall business and framework oversight, global operations, corporate strategy and development at the gaming technology supplier. Burton also served as the CEO of Askott Entertainment prior to the company’s merger with FansUnite.</p>
<p>As chief corporate development officer at payment solutions supplier Nuvei Corporation, Erlick is responsible for strategic business development oversight across key industry verticals and corporate partnerships, while looking to support the overall growth of the company in North America.</p>
<p>Erlick boasts of more than 20 years of industry experience dealing with payments, sports and entertainment, supporting partnerships with professional sports teams and leagues, as well as companies from high-growth digital sectors.</p>
<p>DraftKings SVP of International Strategy Haas has more than 20 years of gambling industry experience at PokerStars, the World Poker Tour (WPT), Asia Pacific Poker Tour (APPT), European Poker Tour (EPT) and PartyPoker.</p>
<p>His responsibilities at the Boston-based digital sports entertainment and gaming company include business strategy development oversight across daily fantasy sports, online casino games and digital media.</p>
<p>Keeling, who started working in the gaming industry at the age of eight as his family and outside partners owned racetracks in Surrey and Victoria in British Columbia (BC), was retained by Great Canadian following its acquisitions of the racetracks in 2004 as the company believed he was best suited to oversee its horse racing interests.</p>
<p>Keeling was appointed in 2013 as Vice President, Stakeholder Relations and Responsible Gaming and six years later, became Executive Vice President, Stakeholder Relations and Responsible Gaming, with a focus on GC’s properties in BC.</p>
