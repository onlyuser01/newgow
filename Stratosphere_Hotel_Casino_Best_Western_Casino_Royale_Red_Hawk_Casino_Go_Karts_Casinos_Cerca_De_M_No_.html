<p>NetEnt has made its live games available to 888 casino clients following a partnership struck yesterday, July 14.</p>
<p>888 Casino Clients Now Have Access to Live Game Titles by NetEnt</p>
<p>Following a new agreement, famous casino game developer NetEnt rolled out live casino games for clients of 888 casino. Among the live titles available, there is the highly popular Live Blackjack, Live Roulette, Perfect Blackjack but also Blitz Blackjack games. In addition, exclusive features are also going to be available to 888 casino clients. These features include professional live dealers, multiple camera views and fully customizable gameplay options.</p>
<p>Andres Rengifo, NetEnt live casino director, said that with this new partnership, a high standard is set by 888 casino for the regulated online gaming market. Rengifo continued by saying that NetEnt is glad to provide the company’s exciting portfolio of popular interactive live casino games to 888 casino clients.</p>
<p>The 888 Holding Plc Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Guy Cohen, 888 senior vice president of B2C, said that the company was pleased with the new deal. According to Cohen, NetEnt is: “one of the world’s finest live casino developers.” Furthermore, Cohen outlined that the live casino had become an important element of 888’s game offering. He said that many of 888’s players were looking for more authentic experience similar to Las Vegas, Monte Carlo and Atlantic City but from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, 888 Holding Plc struck two more key partnerships. Earlier this month, the company extended its partnership with the Delaware Lottery for two more years. The partnership between 888 and the lottery dates back to 2013 when 888 became the exclusive technology provider for the lottery.</p>
<p>Another key partnership for 888 casino was announced back in June. The company teamed up with the contemporary gaming platform Playzido. Under the partnership, Playzido launched exciting new gaming content for 888 casino as well as for the bingo brands by 888. Under the partnership, 888 clients will be able to access popular titles such as: Tiki Runner by Bulletproof Games, Atlantis Megaways by ReelPlay and Dumb and Dumber and Deal or No Deal Rapid Round by Endemol Shine Gaming, and others.</p>
