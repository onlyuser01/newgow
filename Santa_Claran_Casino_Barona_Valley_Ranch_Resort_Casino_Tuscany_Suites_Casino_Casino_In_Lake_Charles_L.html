<p>Genius Sports has announced that it’s acquiring FanHub Media, tapping into the platform’s F2P portfolio of games, social experiences, and looking to improve the cost per acquisition, among other things.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Strengthens Social Offer with FanHub Media Assets</p>
<p>Sports tech company Genius Sports has acquired free-to-play games and fan engagement solutions provider FanHub Media Holdings with the bulk of the financial terms not disclosed and the deal subject to final approval in the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>FanHub is a company founded in 2012 and focusing on technology solutions that pivot around betting games and social activation.</p>
<p>The company has established itself as a global leader with its core features benefiting gaming operators and assisting with player retention and engagement. Presently, the company runs operations across the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moving forward with the deal, Genius Sports will acquire the bulk of FanHub offers, including its free-to-play games, fantasy sports, trivia, bracket challenges, polling games, and other contests developed exclusively to boost engagement with fans.</p>
<p>Genius Sports will use its reach within some of the largest sporting bodies, including the MLB, MLS, and the NFL, to create engaging and tailored contests that successfully identify the needs of customers and deliver on the desired product.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company works with some of the most respected betting operators, including Betway, PointsBet, and others. Genius will benefit from the company’s proven media services and content options, boosting sponsor activation and improving cost-efficiency when it comes to acquisition.</p>
<p>A Complementary Offer That Makes Sense</p>
<p>FanHub’s games will be joining Genius Sports’ own portfolio of data, stats, live odds, messaging, and video highlights, to name a few. Commenting on the partnership, Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke had this to add:</p>
<p>“The acquisition of FanHub will provide our sports, betting, and media partners with exciting new content platforms that entirely complement our established data, video, and marketing solutions. This transaction is expected to expand Genius Sports’ global audience and reach while accelerating the convergence of sports, betting, and media to engage the modern fan.”</p>
<p>FanHub chairman Tim Lamb welcomed the news and said that he was happy to see the company join the Genius Sports family. Andrew Cronyn, FanHub founder, and CEO added that they couldn’t have imagined a “more complementary partner,” pointing out the rich synergies that the two companies would be able to achieve together.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to officially finalize during the second quarter. No financial details have been disclosed. In the meantime, Genius Sports has had much to be happy about.</p>
<p>The company posted strong full-year and fourth-quarter results. Genius successfully completed its merger with dMY Technologies II securing the rights for the sports data provider to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</p>
