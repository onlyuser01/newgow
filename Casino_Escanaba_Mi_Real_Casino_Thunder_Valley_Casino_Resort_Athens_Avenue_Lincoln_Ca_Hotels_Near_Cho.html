<p>According to recent numbers by the Pennsylvania regulator, casinos in the state are keeping a significantly low number of infected employees. Out of 16,000 employees in the gaming industry in the state, only 108 have tested positive for COVID-19 since the reopening of the venues in early June.</p>
<p>Less Than 1% of Casino Employees Test Positive for COVID-19</p>
<p>Since the reopening of Pennsylvania’s casinos in June, there have been a total of 108 confirmed positive cases of casino employees, according to data released on Thursday last week by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). Out of the 16,000 casino employees in the state, 108 positive COVID-19 cases represent less than 1%.</p>
<p>Although the number of positive cases remains quite low, when we compare the number of positive COVID-19 casino employees from September to October, we observe an increase. Back in September, there were only 14 casino employees in Pennsylvania who tested positive for COVID-19. This number jumped to 44 employees in October.</p>
<p>“It should be noted that many of the employees who tested positive or were presumptive positive had not been on the facility’s property for a number of days before notification was made to the Board.” PGCB attorney Denise L. Miller-Tshudy</p>
<p>Denise L. Miller-Tshudy, attorney for the PGCB said that no specific details about the occupied positions of the casino employees who tested positive for COVID-19 were received. However, according to Miller-Tshudy the employees who tested positive were not in positions that have had a contact with the public or work in public areas.</p>
<p>Rivers Pittsburgh and Parx Report a Small Number of Positive COVID-19 Employees</p>
<p>According to the PGCB data, most cases of positive casino employees were reported at Rivers Pittsburgh casino – 28 employees. Furthermore, at Parx in Bensalem, there were a total of 25 positive COVID-19 employees. With that in mind, there are 1,360 employees at Rivers Pittsburgh casino and the 28 positive cases represent just around 2%.</p>
<p>Jack Horner, a spokesman for the Rivers Casino outlined that although the properties operate in two counties in Pennsylvania with some of the highest population densities, the number of positive casino team members remains low.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely grateful to Rivers Casino’s Team Members in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh for their relentless dedication to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace.” Jack Horner, spokesman for Rivers Casino</p>
<p>In an interview for the Bucks County Courier Times, Carrie Nork Minelli, director of advertising and public relations at Parx said that there have been more than 1.4 million people who visited the property since its reopening 18 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Minelli outlined that there are more than 1,900 employees currently working and the 25 employees who tested positive represent only 1.3% of the workforce. She added that no hospitalization was required for any of the employees who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
