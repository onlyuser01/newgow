    <h1>Seneca Casino Niagara Falls Ny Charlestown Casino Bluechip Casino Casino Fallsview Niagara Online Sl</h1>

<p>Alea, a company that specializes in game aggregation for the online casino sector, has shaken up things at the top with Alex Tomic, the company’s founder and hitherto Chief Executive Officer, vacating the position in favor of Jordi Sendra who has become the new person at the helm. Tomic will continue to support the company in a non-executive role and offer his input to help steer Alea towards a sounder future, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Sendra is stepping into the CEO's shoes from his current role of COO, with the shift designed to better reflect on the growing relevance of Alea in a dynamic and competitive market around the world. The company has indeed been pushing rapidly across various markets, including Africa, Asia, and Latin America, among others.</p>
<p>Emerging markets and developed ones remain in focus for Alea, which aggregates more than 10,000 curated and select titles from the world’s best developers. Meanwhile, Sendra’s position has been assumed by Ramon Glieneke who will now run the day-to-day and help steer the aggregation platform towards new commercial milestones.</p>
<p>Sendra was welcoming of the present shake-up and spoke highly of both his colleagues mentioned in the official press release. He said that he had worked with Tomic in the past three years leading to his present appointment, and that he was immensely thankful for the opportunity to learn from him.</p>
<p>"We are always looking for new and incredibly talented people from outside of the iGaming industry to join us on this journey. Ramon’s API aggregation experience gained from working within the travel sector will provide us with a whole new level of knowledge and perspective and will help to ensure our success moving forward," Sendra added.</p>
<p>Glieneke was similarly excited to see this partnership take shape. He called it a fantastic opportunity and said that he already had the necessary industry experience to fulfil his role and create value for Alea. As to Tomic, he will be devoting more time outside of business but still be part of the industry while keeping an eye on Alea which he virtually helped build.</p>
<p>Alea recently added both Gaming Corps and Thunderkick to its roster of partners for the aggregation platform.</p>
