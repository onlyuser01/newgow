<p>The leading owner, developer and manager of premier entertainment resorts across the United States, Canada and Northern Asia, Mohegan, announced multiple senior-level appointments. The company confirmed it strengthened its senior-level team by hiring Joffre Wells for the role of VP of Capital Markets, Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Joining Mohegan's C-Suite, he will play an important role by overseeing the company's capital planning.</p>
<p>Wells will leverage his extensive experience and help strengthen strategic processes at the company, including banking and investor relationships, interest rate management and others. His responsibilities are going to include providing strategic guidance for analysis and financial planning processes, team development and overseeing strategic accounting projects.</p>
<p>Currently, Wells holds an MS in Finance from Drexel University, as well as an MBA in Management Information Systems. Moreover, he has a BBA in Finance from Temple University. As a seasoned executive, Wells brings extensive experience. Before joining Mohegan, he was a part of Brandywine Global where he served as a Global Macro Trader. Throughout his career, Wells also held the role of Global Rates Trader - Vice President at BlackRock.</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, Mohegan's President and CEO, shared his excitement about the recent hire in a statement. "We're so thrilled to have Joffre Wells join our team as his leadership and financial expertise are a perfect fit for our organization, especially as we continue to grow as a premier operator of integrated entertainment resorts," he explained.</p>
<p>Besides hiring Wells, Mohegan confirmed two more strategic appointments. The company revealed it promoted Kelly Sullivan to the role of VP of People Operations. Additionally, Mohegan elevated Kelly Leung to the role of Senior Vice President of International Marketing.</p>
<p>Sullivan's career within the Mohegan family started back in 2013. At the time, she was appointed to the role of Director of Career and Leadership Development for the Mohegan Tribe. This position enabled Sullivan to accumulate significant knowledge within HR while also driving the Tribe's affairs forward. Back in 2016, she was hired as Director of Global Human Resources and Development for Mohegan. In her new role, as VP of People Operations, Sullivan is expected to lead the company's Corporate People Operations team and play a major role in hiring, onboarding, engagement and other key processes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Leung, who was appointed to the role of SVP of International Marketing, has nearly three decades of experience within the entertainment and gaming industry. His career with Mohegan Sun started back in 2006 when he was appointed to the role of VP of Player Development of Asian Marketing. In his new role as SVP of International Marketing, Leung will be in charge of key marketing initiatives for Mohegan Sun. Moreover, he will also oversee the company's international portfolio.</p>
<p>"Kelly Sullivan and Kelly Leung are also exemplary team members at Mohegan and their respective promotions are well deserved," explained Mohegan's President and CEO. Finally, Pineault said that the company heads into 2024 supported by a strong team of seasoned experts and gaming industry veterans that will help the brand continue to evolve.</p>
