<p>Data sports, technology and content business Genius Sports and the Canadian Football League (CFL) announced Wednesday the launch of CFL Blitz Picks, a new free-to-play (F2P) predictor game.</p>
<p>‘Just the Tip of the Iceberg’</p>
<p>The CFL Blitz Picks F2P predictor game, launched as part of the data and tech partnership Genius Sports and the CFL announced in December last year, in collaboration with online betting and gaming operator BetRegal, will become part of CFL Game Zone alongside the league’s other F2P offerings such as CFL Pick’em, CFL Fantasy and CFL Preseason Futures, as well as other exclusive products.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the new predictor game, Genius Sports’ managing director of Media &amp; Engagement Josh Linforth outlined the “incredible fan base” of the CFL that is “yearning to be closer and more connected to the game” as the main factor influencing the company’s decision to team with the league.</p>
<p>“We have the infrastructure in place, and we are taking steps alongside the CFL to realize our vision for creating that bond,” he continued, outlining that CFL Blitz Picks and CFL Game Zone “are just the tip of the iceberg” as both partners are determined to continue to provide “richer, more interactive and engaging” experiences to the sports fans.</p>
<p>The CFL Blitz Picks will allow fans of football to test their knowledge of players and teams every week starting from Week 12 and going through the Grey Cup on November, 20, all while competing for four season tickets and four jerseys of their favorite team from the league.</p>
<p>Bridge the Gap between CFL and Fans</p>
<p>Tyler Mazereeuw, chief revenue and marketing officer of the CFL spoke on behalf of the league to express the excitement at the opportunity to offer fans “this new gaming experience” that was made possible due to the partnership with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>“..CFL Blitz Picks represents another fun and exciting avenue to bridge the gap between the league and our incredible fans,” Mazereeuw continued, outlining that the new F2P game has something to offer for everyone – from the seasoned CFL diehard to the novice to Canadian football – providing them with a chance “to show off… knowledge and learn about the league.”</p>
<p>CFL Blitz Picks players will accumulate player points according to their predictions while leaderboards on a weekly, monthly and season-long basis will feature on the platform. The game will also allow for fan-customized mini leagues where players can measure their skills against relatives, friends and family members.</p>
<p>“Genius Sports and the league are opening the door with CFL GameZone, and we’d love for all of our fans to walk through and connect – not only with each other but also the league,” added Mazereeuw.</p>
