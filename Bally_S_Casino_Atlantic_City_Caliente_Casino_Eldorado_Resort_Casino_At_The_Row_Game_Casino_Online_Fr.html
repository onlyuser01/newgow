<p>IBIA, the International Betting Integrity Association, is unwavering as it attempts to secure more exposure for its cause, which is to keep sports free of pernicious influence. Now, the organization has secured Pinnacle, prominent sports, and iGaming firm as its latest member, helping IBIA advance its cause.</p>
<p>IBIA Welcomes Another Influential Partner to Its Ranks</p>
<p>Pinnacle is one of the oldest gaming and betting companies in the space, established in 1998 and operating in numerous jurisdictions thanks to licenses from Malta, Sweden, and Italy. Pinnacle is also touted as one of the earliest adopters of esports betting at a time when other companies were hesitant about the vertical or only saw it as an attempt to convert video gamers into sports bettors.</p>
<p>This plan clearly didn’t work. Over the years, Pinnacle has collected a deeper understanding of both the sports and esports betting markets, making the company a good fit for IBIA’s future plans to tackle corruption. Welcoming Pinnacle to the organization, IBIA CEO Khalid Ali had nothing but praise to offer the company. He said:</p>
<p>The size and scope of Pinnacle’s sports betting operation make it a valuable addition to IBIA’s global monitoring and alert network. IBIA CEO Khalid Ali</p>
<p>IBIA welcomed the opportunity to be adding yet another partner to what the executive described as a growing roster of trusted partners. A leading operator such as Pinnacle choosing to join is a testament that IBIA’s on the right path in ensuring the integrity and safety of sports betting contests.</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s Executives Determined to Fight Manipulation in Sports</p>
<p>Pinnacle CEO Paris Smith welcomed the opportunity as well. She said that the company itself is focused on integrity and is working closely with like-minded partners to help tackle the problem. She said that Pinnacle will be working closely with IBIA to fulfill the two partners’ shared goal of purging sports from manipulation.</p>
<p>Pinnacle sports integrity manager Gareth Gray also joined the conversation and added that explained that by being accepted as an IBIA member, the betting company is recognized as a trusted and powerful ally that has done extensive work to ensure that it can clean sports betting from fraud and provide a safe and enjoyable environment for all.</p>
