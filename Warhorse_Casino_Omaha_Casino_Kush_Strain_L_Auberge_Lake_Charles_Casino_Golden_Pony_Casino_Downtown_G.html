<p>The leading global sports technology company, Sportradar Group AG, announced a new collaboration with the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Last week, the company revealed that it emerged as the successful bidder for a new exclusive global audio and video (AV) and betting data rights contract. As a result, Sportradar will be able to boost interest in South American football and help the sport expand its audience.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by Sportradar, the new contract comes after a competitive selection process. As the winner of the multi-year exclusive agreement, the company secured worldwide rights for CONMEBOL Libertadores, both Men's and Women's tournaments. Additionally, Sportradar secured rights for CONMEBOL Sudamericana and CONMEBOL Recopa which are some of the most popular tournaments for sport.</p>
<p>The rights cover the next four seasons, explained the company, confirming that the new collaboration launches with the current season and also covers the betting rights for CONMEBOL Libertadores Beach Soccer, CONMEBOL Libertadores Futsal (Men's and Women's), as well as CONMEBOL Libertadores U20.</p>
<p>The collaboration isn't the first one for CONMEBOL and Sportradar. The duo previously joined forces in 2019 when Sportradar agreed to deliver its Risk, Compliance and Governance Services via its team of experts in due diligence and intelligence called the Intelligence &amp; Investigations unit. This collaboration saw CONMEBOL benefit from Sportradar's eligibility checks for different senior-level appointments.</p>
<p>Carsten Koerl, Sportradar's global CEO, commented on the latest deal with CONMEBOL explaining: "We are delighted that Sportradar has been selected as the official partner who can support the most historic club tournaments in South America."</p>
<p>He added: "Sportradar has more than 20 years’ experience building innovative products from data, and as the market leader, we are best positioned with the technological expertise and industry relationships to help CONMEBOL expand its reach." Koerl pointed out that South American football currently has one of the most passionate fan bases around the globe. Finally, Sportradar's global CEO predicted that the collaboration will help boost the popularity of the sport and increase engagement with the fans.</p>
<p>José Astigarraga, CONMEBOL's Secretary General, was similarly delighted about the freshly minted agreement with Sportradar. "We are glad to strengthen the relationship with Sportradar, one of the best companies in terms of technological innovation and transparency in global sports betting," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Astigarraga noted: "We are sure that the prestigious CONMEBOL club tournaments, with more than 60 years of history, will be a great showcase to be able to get closer to the true fans of South American football."</p>
