<p>ICRG has recently courted donations from some of the biggest gambling operators in the United States, among which Caesars, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>The International Center for Responsible Gaming, which focuses on funding research into problem gambling, gambling addiction treatment, and prevention, has now received another sizable donation by Bally’s Corporation which vowed $600,000 to help the ICRG continue with its cutting-edge scientific research.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corp’s donation focuses specifically on funding research into understanding responsible gambling tools and how they can help young adults control their gambling habits and play responsibly. The contribution has been welcomed by ICRG President Arthur Paikowsky who praised the company’s commitment to young adult gamblers and its determination to find ways and improve the effectiveness of responsible gambling tools.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling has been a topic that Casino Guru has explored in some depth as well. Earlier this year, the company introduced the Global Online Gambling Self-Exclusion Scheme known as GSES for short. ICRG is similarly minded in furthering the industry’s understanding and commitment to ensuring that consumers remain safe.</p>
<p>ICRG focuses on raising funds that are then distributed in the form of grants to promising scientific endeavors that can help deepen understanding of issues in the gambling industry relative to consumer health, safety, and addiction. Ideally, ICRG wants to create what it describes as effective responsible gambling strategies.</p>
<p>Robeson Reeves, President of Interactive at Bally’s Corp., is himself similarly pleased with the effort to educate the public and help protect young adult gamblers on the merits of responsible gambling. Bally’s Corp. seeks to leverage the results of research overseen by ICRG and improve the overall landscape for safe gambling in North America and beyond.</p>
<p>ICRG was established in 1996 in a bid to respond to growing concerns that gambling addiction is often an overlooked problem. The organization was able to elicit action from some of the most prominent companies in the sector over the years, leading to the publishing of hundreds of peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p>ICRG is more ambitious in the overall scope. It wishes to not just deepen responsible gambling practices, but also educate treatment providers, advise on public policy and regulators, and raise awareness of gambling disorder as a legitimate problem that needs to be addressed in earnest when regulators draft new gambling laws. Generous donations by the likes of Bally’s are not just a token gesture, but the path to a future in which gamblers are better protected under law and business practices.</p>
