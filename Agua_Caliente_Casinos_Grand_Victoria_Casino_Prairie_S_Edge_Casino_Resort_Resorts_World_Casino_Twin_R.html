<p>Bonnie &amp; Clyde review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bonnie &amp; Clyde captured the public imagination in the 1930s when their hideout was raided and Bonnie’s poetry and photographs were made public. Their star had largely waned by the time they were gunned down in an ambush by the Texas Rangers but subsequent pop culture interpretations re-romanticised them for the following generation.</p>
<p>Given their lives as armed robbers, it seems only right that the internet age should put their faces on a digital one-armed bandit all of their own.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The world of the Bonnie &amp; Clyde slot is richly realised with the background showing the stolen 1934 Ford Deluxe V-8, the car in which they were to be eventually ambushed and killed by Frank Hamer.</p>
<p>However, when we find them on the reels, they are very much alive, accompanied by a soundtrack that includes Tommy gun fire and police sirens to be sure, but here Bonnie and Clyde are still looking the best they have since Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway played them on the silver screen.</p>
<p>The animations are sprightly and fitting, with the reel animations playing out across a background of loose fifty dollar bills. Visually, this slot is great.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is a little standard given the impressive visuals. This five reel slot has four rows and fifty winlines, as well as a few nice features such as the Clyde symbols which are stacked on the reels and pay out both directions on the winlines.</p>
<p>There is also a Free Spin bonus described below. However, due to the high variance, this feature will come along very rarely and there is not so much as a gamble feature to generate some variation in the way the gameplay works.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. They appear only on reels two to four.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol has Bonnie on it and triggers the Free Spin feature if the player hits three or more Bonus symbols on one spin. The basic Bonus symbols will trigger 10, 20 or 50 free spins for three, four or five Bonus symbols respectively.</p>
<p>Some Bonus symbols come with a number on them. This can be either +2, +5, +10, +20 or +50. If the Bonus is triggered by any of these numbered symbols, that number is added to the number of Free Spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player for Bonnie &amp; Clyde is an absolute stick up at just 95.10%. Our yardstick for average is around 96%, so this comes in well below that.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin. This is oddly restricted, a common feature of RedRakeGaming’s output, but ought to cover most of the middle of the bell curve for bet size preferences.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which doesn’t quite match our preference for high volatility slots. We like the volatility higher as it works with our slot strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Though visually engaging and thematically strong, Bonnie &amp; Clyde could use some improvements as a slot game. The gameplay issues may not bother most players, but the below average return to player is likely to be a sticking point.</p>
<p>Against this, prospective players must weigh things like volatility, but in Bonnie &amp; Clyde’s case the highly volatile tempers of the murderous protagonists do not translate into more than a medium level volatility.</p>
<p>Overall, therefore, we cannot recommend this game.</p>
