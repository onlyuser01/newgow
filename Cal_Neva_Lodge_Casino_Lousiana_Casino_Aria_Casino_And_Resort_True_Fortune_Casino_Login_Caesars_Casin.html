<p>Voice-to-text betting software developer Voxbet announced today another key hire with the appointment of Ian Marmion as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>Transform Sports Betting Experience through Technology</p>
<p>New appointment Marmion will be focusing on Voxbet’s growth and strategic direction as the company is relying on its vision and technology to transform the user experience for sports bettors from all generations. His most recent role was as trading and operations director for a global sportsbook at The Stars Group.</p>
<p>Outlining Marmion’s credentials in “developing and optimizing industry-leading digital products,” clear communication, and “excellent business relationship management skills,” Voxbet founder and chief executive officer Jonathan Power was confident the new company’s director would live to his fame.</p>
<p>“We’re confident his appointment will assist us in achieving our goals, underscored by his sharp strategic focus around the online customer experience, data and innovation. Needless to say, Ian brings significant value to our leadership team, as we look to improve market share across Europe, and prepare ourselves for rapid expansion on both sides of the pond.” Jonathan Power, Founder and CEO, Voxbet</p>
<p>Marmion, who is a long-term proponent of developing new technologies in sports betting to modernize the industry, was one of the first to introduce automated pricing and trading models in the early 2000s while serving as trading director at BetVictor. He was also instrumental in re-imagining the in-play UX at BetStars and FoxBet after contracting Banach Technology.</p>
<p>‘Operators Have Been Doing the Same for Too Long’</p>
<p>Thrilled to strengthen his involvement with the team at Voxbet, new company director Marmion outlined his strong belief in the transformative power of new technology on the sports betting industry, noting that “operators have been doing the same thing for too long,”</p>
<p>“Voxbet now allows bettors to engage with sports betting the way they already engage with almost everything else online – and that journey begins with speaking or typing what you want. We let operators broaden their reach and make betting more convenient, simpler and faster – providing an overall richer customer experience.” Ian Marmion, Non-Executive Director, Voxbet</p>
<p>The addition of Marmion to Voxbet’s ranks followed just months after the firm announced the appointment of Andrew Lee as its Chairman. The high-profile appointment coincided with a rebranding of the business formerly known as Onionsack.</p>
<p>During a funding round last month, Voxbet attracted investor interest from new investors among which investment funds Waterhouse VC and Tekkorp Capital, and received new financing to support its international expansion and further enhance its natural language processing technology.</p>
