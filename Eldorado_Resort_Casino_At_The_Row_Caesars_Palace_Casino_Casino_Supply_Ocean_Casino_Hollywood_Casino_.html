    <h1>Eldorado Resort Casino At The Row Caesars Palace Casino Casino Supply Ocean Casino Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam! I had a dispute with Golden Tiger Casino - the casino blocked my account and refused to receive funds in the amount of 2622.00 USD.</p>
<p>On March 1, at the direction of the casino, the following documents were uploaded to my account: a passport and a photo of a bank statement.</p>
<p>On March 16, I uploaded a passport, a photo of a bank statement, a screenshot of the Skrill e-wallet profile to my account.</p>
<p>On March 26, Golden Tiger Casino informed me that it would take 2 business days for my withdrawal to be processed. But the funds did not arrive in my wallet within the timeframe specified by Golden Tiger Casino.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly contacted Golden Tiger Casino in the hope of getting information about the timing of the transfer of funds. Also, relevant messages were sent at the direction of the casino to riskmanagement@casinorewards.com.</p>
<p>Golden Tiger Casino repeatedly violated the reasonable deadlines for withdrawing my funds. Also, Golden Tiger Casino blocked my account, and without giving reasons. And now Golden Tiger Casino refuses to receive my funds in the amount of 2622.00 USD.</p>
<p>I am an honest player and all my actions are in the legal field, my gaming behavior is fully consistent with the local legal acts of Golden Tiger Casino. I provided Golden Tiger Casino with all the documents that the casino requested.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the actions of Golden Tiger Casino in relation to me are not lawful.</p>
<p>Moreover, I believe that Golden Tiger Casino is not entitled to invoke some circumstances (due to the current regulatory framework) that are beyond my control and to which I am not directly related, arguing the refusal to pay out my funds.</p>
<p>The official claim was sent to the casino on May 11, but I did not receive a response to it.</p>
<p>Please help me to resolve the dispute.</p>
