<p>Pragmatic Play continues to build up its footprint in the regulated Swiss iGaming market with a new partnership with Partouche Groupe</p>
<p>This time around, the company is teaming up with the Pasino.ch brand to bring a variety of online games that will be available to even more players in the market.</p>
<p>Partouche Groupe is a big name in Europe, with strong positions in France, Switzerland, Belgium, and beyond. Moving forward, Groupe’s Swiss operations will benefit from outstanding titles, such as Big Bass Bonanza, Sweet Bonanza, Hand of Midas, and Gates of Olympus among many others.</p>
<p>Extending Pragmatic Play’s Reach in Switzerland</p>
<p>Slots are a big part of Pragmatic Play’s offer, and they will now strengthen Pasino.ch in myriad ways. Having achieved global acclaim, the titles brought around by Pragmatic Play are created in such a way as to promote better engagement and retention rates.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the new opportunity and said that Partouche Groupe was an undeniable name in the iGaming and land-based gaming sectors in Europe. She further added:</p>
<p>We are proud to be in perfect alignment with the group’s aim of providing high-quality entertainment, and it presents the perfect opportunity for us to put our award-winning games in front of even more players and grow our footprint in the Swiss market. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>Pasino.ch managing director Rupert Ecker was similarly pleased with the opportunity to power the digital content with an established company such as Pragmatic Play. Pragmatic Play’s track record for creating excellent games is a strong advantage to any operator that features its title, and it will provide a further upgrade to the Swiss online casino operations for the company.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be able to offer our players such a huge number of new titles and we’re sure our slots enthusiasts are going to have a fantastic time with the number of new games available to them,” Ecker concluded.</p>
