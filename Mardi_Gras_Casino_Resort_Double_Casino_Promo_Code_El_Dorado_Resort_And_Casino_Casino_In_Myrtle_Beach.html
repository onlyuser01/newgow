    <h1>Mardi Gras Casino Resort Double Casino Promo Code El Dorado Resort And Casino Casino In Myrtle Beach</h1>

<p>Casino and hospitality giant Caesars Entertainment unveiled a new partnership with news publisher NOLA.com. The agreement will see NOLA.com become Caesars’ exclusive sports betting and odds provider.</p>
<p>NOLA.com Becomes Caesars’ Exclusive Odds Partner</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook will use NOLA.com’s brand new Bet.NOLA.com gaming resource as a platform to share odds and analysis with bettors. Live odds will be directly integrated and users will also get special promotions for Caesars’ offerings.</p>
<p>Caesars Digital’s co-president, Chris Holdren, spoke that the agreement will allow Caesars to “deepen its connection to the people of Louisiana, a community with which Caesars shares a rich history”. The casino company will collaborate with NOLA.com to deliver fun, engaging and timely updates that will both inform sports fans of what is how now and “bring them closer to the games they love”.</p>
<p>The agreement shows Caesars’ intentions of reinforcing its positions in the state of Louisiana in wait for sports betting to go live. The sports betting legalization process began last year when a large majority of voters voted in favor of it. In June this year, Governor John Bel Edwards signed the respective legislation.</p>
<p>Caesars and NOLA.com: A Powerful Duo</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s regional president, Dan Real, shared that for him and many others Caesars employees in Louisiana grabbing a NOLA.com newspaper is the natural thing to do in the morning. Real, therefore, believes that having NOLA.com as Caesars’ partner will help the casino giant reach an even wider audience.</p>
<p>“As we look to blaze the trail into legal sports betting in Louisiana, our collaboration with The Advocate, Times-Picayune, and Nola.com staff is another example of our commitment to serving the community,” Real stated.</p>
<p>NOLA.com’s president and publisher, Judi Terzotis, also spoke on the agreement. She pointed out that Caesars’ exceptional influence and established presence in Louisiana made it a natural choice of a premier partner. Partnering with the casino company will double down on NOLA.com’s aim is to provide readers with the “widest variety of the most accurate odds”.</p>
<p>Terzotis believes that NOLA.com’s reach and Caesars’ sports betting odds and offerings are going to make them a powerful duo in the local sports betting market.</p>
<p>Being such an influential company, Caesars Entertainment realizes the importance of grabbing the opportunities early. With the NOLA.com deal, the casino company has secured itself a powerful ally on the Louisiana market. Just a few days ago Caesars signed another big name in Louisiana as a partner, namely the Louisiana State University.</p>
