<p>Parimatch, a global esports betting brand, has signed a new major partnership with Team Secret, the runner-up to The International 11. This is the second major partnership for Parimatch in the last months in the esports ecosystem after the company signed a partnership with 00Nation at the beginning of October.</p>
<p>Parimatch Signs Team Secret as New Esports Partner</p>
<p>The partnership is effective starting today, November 1, and will focus on building a strong collaboration that creates fresh fan experiences and elevates both organizations’ respective brands. The partnership was welcomed by executives in both organizations. Parimatch brand representative Stepan Shulga, an esports fan himself, noted:</p>
<p>Team Secret is a legendary brand for the entire DOTA 2 community since its foundation in 2014. Its exceptional persevering fighting spirit perfectly matches the Parimatch brand character. Parimatch brand representative Stepan Shulga</p>
<p>Shulga confirmed that Parimatch was thrilled to have this opportunity to deepen its ties with one of the biggest esports powerhouses. Team Secret was founded in 2014 and it has been a force to reckon with in Dota 2, having competed fiercely in the highest tiers of the game over the past eight years.</p>
<p>Team Secret CEO John Yao was similarly pleased with the opportunity to team up with Parimatch. “Partnering with Parimatch brings new opportunities for Team Secret DOTA and we look forward to working together to deliver unseen and behind-the-scenes content with the team,” the executive noted.</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by team captain Clement “Puppey” Ivanov, who is a legend in the Dota 2 gaming community and has previously played with Na’Vi, the team that largely engineered the contemporary competitive scene around the game. He said:</p>

<p>Parimatch is stepping in as the official esports betting partner for Team Secret. The company’s branding and imagery will be available on player jerseys and hoodies, and the Parimatch branding will be visible both in-game during Team Secret games and as part of their official social media channels. There will be a number of initiatives that the two organizations will work on together, such as special fan activations, raffles, tickets to live events, and more.</p>
