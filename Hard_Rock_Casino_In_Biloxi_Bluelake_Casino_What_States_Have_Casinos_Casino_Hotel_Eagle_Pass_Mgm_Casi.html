    <h1>Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Bluelake Casino What States Have Casinos Casino Hotel Eagle Pass Mgm Casi</h1>

<p>Hi I have multiple issues with this casinos responsible gambling tools you can set deposits limits and then ask for the to be removed straight away without any cool off or reason for it also the time outs are the same if you set a time out it can be removed straight away from live chat I have set time outs multiple time and asked for them to be removed the next day they state it takes 24h to be removed i asked where in your terms and conditions dose it state about a 24h cool off period I was informed my account would be restored at 2am utc I cannot find any information about it been opened after midnight so when I'm told by an agent on live chat my account will be open at 2am utc I take that as there is no other information regarding this also I set and removed multiple deposits limits and timeout limits over the time I have had my account with you if this doesn't seem to display behaviour of someone with a gambling problem I think there responsible gambling practices need to be investigated if a person sets and removes limits on a regular basis I think they should flag a problem</p>
<p>i set a 3day time out on 14th January I contacted live chat to get it removed for the third time in 4 weeks to remove a limit earlier I was told my account would be reopened ( you will have access again on your account from 15th of January at 2am utc time ) this is from live chat so when I accessed my at at 12am UTC wich is earlier than stated in live chat I ended up losing 2500 euro they say they will not refund my deposits maid during this time I also canâ€™t find anywhere in the terms and conditions about a 24h cool of coming back into active at 12am UTC and I also found they stat there is a 7 day cool off if i request to remove a time out earlier</p>
<p>after informing them about the issues with there responsible gambling tools the closed my account and would not give me the reason I am currently waiting for all my live chat transactions and how many time outs I set and removed earlier since I opened my account</p>
