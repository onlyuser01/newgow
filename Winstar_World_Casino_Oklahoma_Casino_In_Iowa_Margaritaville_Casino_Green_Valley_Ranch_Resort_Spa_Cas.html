<p>The leading resort and casino in Pennsylvania, Wind Creek Bethlehem, announced it opened a new poker room featuring amenities and offering unique experiences</p>
<p>Famous as one of the best resort and casino locations in Pennsylvania, Wind Creek Bethlehem, announced it opened the doors of its new luxury poker room.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Bethlehem Revamps Poker Room</p>
<p>Managed by Wind Creek Hospitality, the authority of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, which is the only federally recognized Native American tribe in Alabama, Wind Creek Bethlehem is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Poker fans that visit the venue are in for a treat after Wind Creek Bethlehem announced Wednesday it introduced a new and improved poker room offering unique amenities.</p>
<p>Joseph DeFranza, Wind Creek Bethlehem’s poker room manager, shared his excitement saying that the new poker room seeks to deliver new experiences for the venue’s guests. At the same time, he pointed out that the poker room stands out with amenities that further complement the experience and convenience of the players.</p>
<p>“We wanted to provide our Guests with a Poker Room that is second to none. This room elevates an already exciting game with new, built-in conveniences that enhance the player experience.“ Joseph DeFranza, poker room manager at Wind Creek Bethlehem</p>
<p>The Poker Room Offers Plenty of Amenities</p>
<p>According to Wind Creek Bethlehem, the amenities of the luxurious poker room include complimentary beverages, as well as an improved poker lounge that can accept guests that are waiting to join a poker game. For the convenience of poker players, there’s also a table-side messaging service. The poker room offers convenience in terms of payment as well. Visitors to the poker room can use the services of a dedicated cage cashier.</p>
<p>The newly revamped poker room features 20 action-packed tables. Not unexpectedly, in line with the new poker room, Wind Creek Bethlehem introduced daily poker events that further contribute toward the positive experience for the visitors.</p>
<p>The popularity of poker in the US, similar to sports betting, continues to increase. Besides retail poker games, Pennsylvania offers online poker as well, after legalizing the activity five years ago, back in December 2017.</p>
<p>Besides poker, Wind Creek Bethlehem offers a variety of other gambling games such as slots, and table games including roulette and blackjack. It’s no surprise that the venue offers a sportsbook as well, tapping into an activity that has been growing rapidly in the last few years.</p>
