<p>A Chicago man who told police he wanted to “take over” and “destroy all casinos” remained in custody in Kane County on nearly a million dollar bail that was set for charges of “felony disorderly conduct” on Friday in connection with alleged threats to bomb the Hollywood Casino in Aurora, Illinois on Feb. 12.</p>

<p>A recently released affidavit and search warrant claimed that 30-year-old Musatdin M. Muadinov, while detained by police on Feb. 12, vowed to “pray to Allah” to “destroy the casino.” He further demanded to meet with President Donald Trump, saying that if his demands were not met, “we would all meet Allah,” according to the affidavit obtained by the Daily Herald.</p>
<p>At another point, he told police he did not want to hurt anyone. The suspect was reported to be delivering a message from Allah and to believe that gambling is a sin, according to the Herald.</p>
<p>Muadinov — who was dressed in what police described as “Muslim attire” when arrested — waived his right to remain silent.</p>
<p>Defendant Visited Casino Day Before</p>
<p>The prior day, Muadinov visited the casino and was seen examining the emergency exits. He also asked venue employees about the exits.</p>
<p>He additionally criticized the clothing worn by waitresses working there, police would later learn from a manager, who contacted authorities after what he deemed to be a concerning interaction with Muadinov.</p>
<p>Authorities initially detained Muadinov after he drove a large box truck to a no-parking area near the casino.</p>
<p>Following the threats, the casino was evacuated for six hours while authorities searched the area. The local sheriff’s department bomb squad specifically looked through the truck, but did not find any explosive devices.</p>
<p>In total, some 150 officers responded to the casino and nearby neighborhood before patrons were let back in.</p>
<p>Serious Charges</p>
<p>Authorities have searched cameras, computers, and memory devices left in the suspect’s box truck. Muadinov was charged with felony disorderly conduct, according to jail records. “Felony disorderly conduct” is the category of charge often used by Illinois authorities when someone makes a false report of a bomb or explosive device.</p>
<p>The charge can either be a misdemeanor or a felony in Illinois. Sentencing for more serious cases, if someone is convicted, could result in prison time of anywhere between one to five years. In some instances, a judge could also impose a fine of between $3,000 and $10,000.</p>
<p>On Friday, Muadinov was being held at the Kane County Adult Justice Center in St. Charles, Illinois on $972,100 bail. Initially, his bail was set at $4 million, but was later reduced. Often, bail is set based on the seriousness of charges, whether a defendant is a flight risk, and if they have ties to the community. Muadinov is next scheduled to appear in court on May 30.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Casino is a floating venue on the Fox River. Located approximately 41 miles west of Chicago, it has some 1,000 slot machines, multiple table games, and a poker room.</p>
