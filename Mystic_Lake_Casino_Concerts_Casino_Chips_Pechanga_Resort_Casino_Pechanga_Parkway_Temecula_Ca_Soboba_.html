<p>CT Interactive, a leading developer of iGaming titles for the online casino sector, has struck a new content partnership with Planet Gaming NV, a global operator that focuses on expanding both companies’ footprints in new and existing markets. The partnership will enable CT Interactive to pursue new endeavors facilitated by Planet Gaming NV’s sizable geographicreach.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has developed more than 200 unique titles built in-house and across a number of categories, including dice slots, cascadingslots, classic slots, and more. The company has successfully struck a number of similar commercial partnerships for its cutting-edge slot games over the past weeks.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, CT Interactive Head of Business Development EMEA, Milena Tsankarska, said that the supplier was happy to team up with yet another partner and assist Planet Gaming NV in providing its players and brands with excellent content such as would appeal to player bases.</p>
<p>Tsankarska said that CT Interactive was honored to work with an established gaming company that packs a powerful punch across global markets. Martin Ivanov, CT Interactive Director of Business Development Americas, was similarly pleased to explore this new opportunity for his company and said that the deal enables CT Interactive to expand its reach and bring products to new clients.</p>
<p>Planet Gaming was similarly thrilled with the opportunity. A spokesperson issued a statement in which they said: "We are happy to enter this new CT interactive family, surely there will be new synergies that will lead to great expansions."</p>
<p>CT Interactive has been actively seeking to consolidate its footprint as a supplier and provider of casino games. The company recently struck a new partnership with MondoGaming for the Italian market, which Tsankarska described as an important jurisdiction for the company at the time.</p>
<p>Just a few days prior to the partnership with MondoGaming, the company teamed up with Microgame, again for the Italian iGaming market. In October, CT Interactive marked another European success with an entry into the Slovakian market, bringing an array of games, including Big Joker, Devil’s Fruits, Hot 7s x 2, and many others to local players. Overall, CT Interactive has been working to actively expand its commercial partnership base and make its products known to more players and in more jurisdictions.</p>
