<p>Kalamba Games has expanded its reach in Latin America by signing a new agreement with BetPlay. Under this agreement, the company will provide its portfolio of outstanding slot games to the Colombian iGaming market with BetPlay’s help.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Strengthens Presence in LatAm</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to choose from 17 dedicated games from the developer’s portfolio and ensure that they have access to new and exciting titles. This comes at a pivotal time for Kalamba Games, which is seeking to expand in Latin America as the market is experiencing a strong upsurge. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby welcomed the opportunity and highlighted its significance:</p>
<p>This is a key partnership for us in a fast-moving and lucrative market. BetPlay’s brand is front and center in Colombia with its sponsoring of the country’s professional football league among other high-profile initiatives, so the deal is a huge boost to our growth plans in the country and the wider region. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby</p>
<p>Kalamba Games will be well-represented in Colombia with titles such as Ducks Till Dawn, Caribbean Anne and others. The Joker series of titles developed by Kalamba will also be featured in the transaction.</p>
<p>The partnership is made possible through Pariplay’s Fusion aggregator which will see BetPlay incorporate Kalamba’s titles.</p>
<p>BetPlay Relies on Kalamba for Better Retention and Engagement</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kalamba is bringing its Bullseye branded player tools to help enhance promotions, engagement, and retention through the use of tournaments, leaderboards, metagems, jackpots, and so much more. Corredor Emresarial (the company which owns BetPlay) general manager Germán Segura added:</p>
<p>Ensuring we have the best and latest content for our players remains a focus for us in driving ourselves forward. Kalamba’s slots and promotional tools are a valuable addition to our casino offering and we’re thoroughly looking forward to working with them and building on this announcement. Corredor Emresarial general manager Germán Segura</p>
<p>BetPlay is also happy with this market opportunity as it enables the company to maintain a good position in Colombia and the Latin American market. Kalamba’s games will contribute to converting new players and inspiring existing consumer bases.</p>
