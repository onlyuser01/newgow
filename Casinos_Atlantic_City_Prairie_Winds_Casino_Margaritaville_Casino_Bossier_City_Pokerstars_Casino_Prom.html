<p>SBTech’s mobile betting product Scoreboard is now available in Oregon</p>
<p>This is the result of a contract between SBTech and the Oregon State Lottery from June</p>
<p>Scoreboard is the first mobile betting app launched by a US state lottery</p>
<p>Legal mobile betting now available in Oregon, thanks to SBTech’s Scoreboard platform, launching a month later after originally planned.</p>
<p>Scoreboard launches in Oregon</p>
<p>Mobile sports betting is now available in Oregon, after SBTech launched its sportsbook offering Scoreboard.</p>
<p>Scoreboard is the first mobile betting app launched by a US state lottery, and it allows players to bet on live bets, futures and prop bets.</p>
<p>The rollout of Scoreboard is a result of a contract signed between SBTech and the Oregon State Lottery back in June. The contract also covers land-based betting, which sees kiosks to be rolled out early next year.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be working hand-in-hand with the Oregon Lottery to launch this exciting new form of entertainment in the state,” SBTech US head Melissa Riahei said.</p>
<p>“The Oregon Lottery is true a pioneer in this space, being the first lottery in the US to launch online sports betting,” she added. “We look forward to providing our innovative and experience-driven products, alongside our full range of managed services, to make this endeavor a huge success for the state of Oregon and its citizens.”</p>
<p>Oregon Lottery director Barry Pack commented that the launch marked an exciting time for the business.</p>
<p>“SBTech is an invaluable partner to us,” he noted, “and we look forward to using SBTech’s innovative products to provide an engaging, entertaining and seamless experience for our players.”</p>
<p>The rollout of Scoreboard was originally planned for September, so as to coincide with the start of the NFL season, but it was delayed to reportedly fine-tune the product.</p>
<p>At the time, PR manager Matthew Shelby explained that the focus was on ensuring a smooth player experience rather than just getting the product to the market.</p>
<p>The Oregon Lottery expects to hit $141.2 million in revenue over the first three years after the launch, with a total handle of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Third success for SBTech</p>
<p>Oregon is not the first World Lottery Association member to sign with SBTech. Sweden’s Svenska Spel and Finland’s Veikkaus also selected the company after going through the appropriate tender processes.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel’s tender took place in mid-September, with SBTech outperforming all rival bidders, according to its own claims, especially with its configurable and localised managed trading solutions and responsible gaming tools. The company’s technology stack and innovative features such as the Yourbet bet builder were also key factors in it securing the contract.</p>
<p>At the time, Svenska Spel Sports &amp; Casino’s product manager for sport and racing Björn Kjellsso said: “It has been a long process to find the right partner for us which we think we have in SBTech.”</p>
<p>“We are very pleased with our choice and we are convinced that our customers will appreciate our updated sportsbook when we go live.”</p>
<p>SBTech’s contract with Veikkaus, on the other hand, dates back to mid-July, with the launch planned for early 2020.</p>
<p>Andrew Cochrane, chief development officer at SBTech, said at the time: “Our award-winning sportsbook solution will power both the online and retail channels for Veikkaus, and we look forward to working in collaboration with their team to provide a comprehensive range of innovative features. This partnership shows the commitment we have to the Nordic region and our continued success in the Lottery sector in signing yet another WLA member.”</p>
