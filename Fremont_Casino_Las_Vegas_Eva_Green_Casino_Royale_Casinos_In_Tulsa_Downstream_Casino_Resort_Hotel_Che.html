<p>Slots Paradise Casino must be one of the most fun casinos I have played recently. The website is centered on the idea of a long, long holiday and the brand clearly doesn’t feel shy about not hiding the vacation vibes. In this Slots Paradise Casino review, I will talk about all that you need to know before making a choice about whether you want to join the casino.</p>
<p>I am going to cover interesting aspects of the casinos, such as bonuses, take a closer look at the available games, and generally give you sound advice on what is good about the casino, and what can be improved. There is plenty that Slots Paradise Casino stands to offer players, so why not roll our sleeves up and take a deep dive?</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>The first thing I usually check is the bonus a casino has to offer. After all, bonuses are designed to tempt players into joining and playing, and I think it’s important to start there. For your comfort, I have broken the available Slots Paradise Casino bonuses into several main categories.</p>
<p>The casino offers a whopping $7,500 across the first four deposits that you can claim here, making it a very worthwhile experience indeed. All of these bonuses are very easy to claim and play through. Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>The welcome bonus at Slots Paradise Casino is a 250% match deposit on your first deposit up to $2,500. This is one of the best match rates I have seen in a casino recently, and definitely appreciate the fact that I can power my bankroll with a bit extra than the traditional 100% match rate.</p>
<p>The bonus itself is very easy to claim as all you need to do is deposit a minimum amount of $25 and enter the WELCOME1 bonus code. You can claim up to $5,000 in winnings, providing you have rolled over the deposit and bonus amounts 35x.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I am not a big fan of is the expiry date which is 7 days after a bonus has been activated. This means that you need to have some time set aside to get the most out of the bonus. On balance, though, I think Slots Paradise Casino is offering a pretty generous offer.</p>
<p>Slots, bingo, keno, and scratch cards all provide 100% contributions toward the wagering requirement, so it’s all good. Progressive slots do not count toward the contributions, though, so keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Deposit Bonuses</p>
<p>There are several deposit bonuses that are part of the $7,500 welcome package and follow pretty much the same logic. Each of the bonuses will be met by a fixed percentage once you deposit a minimum of $25 and enter the respective bonus code. The three deposit bonuses you may pick after the first one are as follows:</p>
<p>2 nd deposit bonus 150% match up to $1,500, WELCOME2 bonus code</p>
<p>deposit bonus 150% match up to $1,500, WELCOME2 bonus code 3 rd deposit bonus 150% match up to $1,500, WELCOME3 bonus code</p>
<p>deposit bonus 150% match up to $1,500, WELCOME3 bonus code 4th deposit bonus 200% match up to $2,000, WELCOME4 bonus code</p>
<p>Each of these bonuses is available for 7 days and it will come along with a 35x wagering requirement that players need to sort out before they can cash out any of their winnings. Overall, I really love the fact of how straightforward the terms and conditions at Slots Paradise Casino are.</p>
<p>Special Bonuses and Match Rates</p>
<p>The welcome package is worth a total of $7,500 and this is quite a good way to start the month at Slots Paradise Casino. Yet, there are more promotions that you may be interested and I personally found them to be useful.</p>
<p>The casino offers a Game of the Week competition which will ask players to spend at least 100 free spins on a particular slot game from Monday through Friday for a chance to win something extra.</p>
<p>Players can also claim the weekend special with a bonus code and get up to $1,000 in bonus funds on weekends. Another bonus is the Money Back Monday which will return 10% in cashback on minimum weekly losses of $50, which is a nice way to offset a few bad bets.</p>
<p>If you want to continue topping up your bankroll, the casino offers 50% and 75% Reload Bonuses that I found handy, although the wagering requirements for both are 40x so it may take you a bit longer to play through.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I think Slots Paradise Casino has done a really good job of keeping its bonus section organized, handy, and exceptionally transparent. There won’t be a moment where you aren’t sure about what the actual terms and conditions of the promotion are, and this is a huge advantage.</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino UI &amp; UX</p>
<p>I don’t usually feature a section dedicated to the user experience or user interface in a review, but in this case, I felt it would be worth mentioning how well-organized Slots Paradise Casino is.</p>
<p>When I first entered the casino, I thought that there was a bit too much going on, but as I browsed through it became apparent that the website was organized well and meaningfully on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>The casino has made sure to make all important terms and conditions visible and easily accessible. Banking, games, bonusing, and customer support are all within reach and easy to navigate to, making for a fun, easy, and rewarding experience.</p>
<p>I generally enjoyed my stay going through the myriad options featured by Slots Paradise Casino while comfortable in the knowledge that I am always aware of what is happening. All in all, the casino offers a sound UI and UX experience that is definitely a feather in its cap.</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino Games and Software</p>
<p>Games at Slots Paradise Casino are many and varied. There are more than 1000 titles to choose from and a whole bunch of software suppliers, too. Players can enjoy titles from established companies such as Nucleus Gaming, BGaming, Betsoft, Rival, Zeus Play, Dragon Gaming, Evoplay, Nucleus Gaming, KA Gaming, Apollo Games, and so many more. In fact, there are some 45+ suppliers here</p>
<p>There are lots of different game sections to choose from as well, including Slots, Blackjack, Roulette, Video Poker, Table Games, Live Dealer, and more. The casino has also used additional filters such as Featured, Favorite, Popular, and New Games to make navigation even simpler.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are definitely the big ticket item here. There are tons of those games to try your hand at with hundreds of available titles to explore. The games are provided by the likes of Betsoft and BGaming, which have made sure to feature their best products to date.</p>
<p>You will find excellent titles such as Babylon, Pho Sho, Mary’s Mining Mania, Book of Wealth, Buffalo Coin Hold and Win, and visually-rich titles such as Take the King, and Dark Mystic. The slot games come with both a real money and demo version that allows you to quickly get the inside scoop of all that is on offer.</p>
<p>Now, there is something very important that I would like you to know about how the whole game library at Slots Paradise Casino is organized. You can click on each slot thumbnail’s “I” or info box and get a detailed breakdown of the game.</p>
<p>This means payout tables, an overview of the game, reviews, a general rating of what to expect such as gameplay, graphics, features, and value, and more. Now, these ratings may need to b e taken with a grain of salt, but they are still a fairly decent indicator. You will also find metrics such as RTP, which is a good way to choose your next slot.</p>
<p>More cool slots include Woodlanders, Golden Dragon Inferno, Legend of Horus, Forgotten Fable, and just so many more. There are dedicated sections with jackpot games and progressive slots, too, that you may find handy if you want to exclusively play these games.</p>
<p>Those include Hot Life Buy Bonus, The Lion, Gold of Maya, Book of Symbols, and so many other worthwhile additions. Some of the progressive slots I would recommend trying are Greedy Goblins, Reels of Wealth, Rags to Witches, at the Copa, Mr. Vegas, and quite a few more!</p>
<p>Table Games at Slots Paradise</p>
<p>Another excellent part of the casino is the selection of table games. I have used this term to aggregate all blackjack and roulette games here, with Slots Paradise Casino having plenty to offer. There is also a dedicated table section if you prefer as well.</p>
<p>There, you will find excellent titles such as Craps, Pirate 21, Pai Gow, Pontoon, War, Three Card Rummy, Draw High Low, Baccarat, Sic Bo, Red Dog, and more. To keep it organized, however, Slots Paradise has made sure to separate Roulette and Blackjack into their own sections.</p>
<p>So, you can find more than 20 game versions of each. For blackjack, you will have access to European and American Blackjack, Single Deck Blackjack, Super 7 Blackjack, Side Bets Blackjack, Blackjack Five Hands, and so many others. I found the blackjack games to be pretty decent with the payout rate set at 98.38% or more for the majority of versions giving you a good return.</p>
<p>The roulette section is equally well-stocked. Players will get to try some of the best versions of the game there are, including Zoom Roulette, European Roulette, American Roulette, and even French Roulette. A few outlier choices here include Lucky Wheel and Virtual Roulette, which are nice additions to the overall selection of titles.</p>
<p>Live Dealer</p>
<p>It’s always nice to see that a casino has gone the extra mile and hosts live casino games. This is a clear commitment to the long-term intentions of a website. Well, Slots Paradise Casino is definitely here to stick around.</p>
<p>The brand hosts games by Vivo Gaming, SuperSpade, LiW, and Fresh Deck Studios and brings together more than 40 live game titles for you to try, which I find as definitely a sound offer. Now, the game themselves are varied and you will find Auto Roulette, Blackjack, Keno, Teen Patti, Baccarat, Andar Bahar, and a few more exciting choices as well. Slots Paradise also introduces players to a few game-show-style options, such as Wheelbet, 1Bet, 5Bet, PokerBet, FruitRace, Lucky 6, and more.</p>
<p>I love the fact how varied the offer is and how you can play some of the most popular live and table games while also exploring a few exotic picks along the way. All in all, Slots Paradise Casino has a very sound live game offer, which is precisely what makes me believe we will be seeing great things from this newly-set-up brand.</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino Payments</p>
<p>I have been talking up Slots Paradise Casino about their transparency. Prior to registering for this review and spending a few good weeks going through the website, I did a cursory look and was very happy to find out that I can actually check out the payment options before registration.</p>
<p>Now, I know many casinos usually have discrepancies in what they have in their pre and after-registration pages when it comes to the Banking section, but Slots Paradise Casino has made sure to keep everything up to date. Overall, you have a rather flexible banking system, but you would need to use cryptocurrencies to cash out your money.</p>
<p>Deposits</p>
<p>MasterCard: $25 – $2,500</p>
<p>Visa: $25 – $2,500</p>
<p>American Express: $50 – $990</p>
<p>Bitcoin: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Ethereum: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Litecoin: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>BitcoinCash: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>Bitcoin: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Ethereum: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Litecoin: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>BitcoinCash: $10 – $50,000</p>
<p>Security and Licensing</p>
<p>In terms of security and licensing, I have seen nothing that worries me. After some digging, I was able to confirm the launch date of the casino as 2022. Generally, the SSL and web protocols check out, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the website.</p>
<p>All necessary measures have been taken to ensure that players are browsing safely. The casino has a responsible gambling policy and runs AML and KYC checks as well, so this is a good thing. One drawback is that I was unable to verify who the owner of the casino is.</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino is also not a licensed casino, maybe owing to the fact how new it is. On balance, though, I felt pretty comfortable playing there, and give it a sound security rating.</p>
<p>Slots Paradise Casino on Mobile</p>
<p>So, I am a lazy person, and this means that I would much rather do most of my work on a smartphone. Reviewing casinos is precisely why I love my job – this innate… strength is also the reason why I am good at what I do and why I can tell you for a fact that Slots Paradise Casino performs excellently on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>I am mostly an iOS user but have a Google Pixel to browse through Android casinos as well. Slots Paradise Casino definitely performs well on both platforms, making it very easy to play, deposit and withdraw money, and access bonuses and customer support.</p>
<p>The casino has definitely been built with the idea of serving well to players from across the full mobile spectrum, and I can say for a fact that I appreciate this a lot. There are no incongruous bits on the mobile screen as is often the case with mobile casinos, and I can definitely see that quality work has gone into building this platform.</p>
