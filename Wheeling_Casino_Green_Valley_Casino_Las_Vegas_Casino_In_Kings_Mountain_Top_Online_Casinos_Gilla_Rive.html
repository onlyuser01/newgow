    <h1>Wheeling Casino Green Valley Casino Las Vegas Casino In Kings Mountain Top Online Casinos Gilla Rive</h1>

<p>Hello. I can help you correct the errors in the text of your complaint about the Bitsler casino. Below, I will provide you with the corrected text:</p>
<p>Good afternoon. I would like to file a complaint about the Bitsler casino. Previously, I used this casino's services without any problems, making deposits and withdrawals. However, my latest payment of $5,300 is being delayed. The withdrawal request was made to my regular USDT Tether wallet. The day before, payments were automatically made to my wallet.</p>
<p>Considering that I spent $10,000 on deposits in the last 2 days, the delay in payment of $5,300 seems like disrespect to the player.</p>
<p>When I contacted support, two managers informed me that the payment is undergoing a standard check. However, when I asked about the deadline for the check to be completed, I was told "as soon as possible" without specifying dates and times.</p>
<p>I request that the casino provides me with detailed information explaining:</p>
<p>1) When will the payment be made to my wallet?</p>
<p>2) What is the reason for the delay in my payment?</p>
<p>3) The casino is positioned as a casino with instant payouts. I want to understand why this casino is violating its own promises.</p>
<p>4) I want clarification from the casino on why payments of more than $5,000 are being delayed while smaller payments are processed instantly.</p>
<p>I believe that this is not a good precedent since I have researched information about this site and found similar complaints. If the casino cannot ensure proper operation for all players, including high rollers, this should be communicated to everyone. Because at first glance, the large company Bitsler contradicts its own offer.</p>
<p>I ask for help from casino.guru in resolving this issue and engaging a casino representative in a dialogue. it seems to me that the question is not only about payment, but also about the mechanism for resolving issues. If any restrictions are implied for the player, specific reasons and deadlines should be given.</p>
<p>I hope that the Bitsler casino will provide me with the necessary information and resolve this issue in a short time.</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>I wouldn't have filed a complaint if I didn't see a lot of negative reviews regarding long delays in payouts. I decided to speed up this situation a bit to avoid the possibility of unwanted manipulation by the casino. I undertake to inform casino.guru in case of a prompt resolution of the complaint.</p>
