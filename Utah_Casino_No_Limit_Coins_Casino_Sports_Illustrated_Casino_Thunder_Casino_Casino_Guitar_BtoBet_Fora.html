    <h1>Utah Casino No Limit Coins Casino Sports Illustrated Casino Thunder Casino Casino Guitar BtoBet Fora</h1>

<p>NeoGames, a tech-driven supplier of online gambling and lottery solutions announced a new deal between its sports betting arm BtoBet and PlayAlberta. This deal marks the brand’s foray into the lucrative Albertan market and comes a day after its parent company posted its Q2 results, highlighting stable growth and favorable expectations for its business.</p>
<p>As agreed, BtoBet will leverage its sports betting capabilities to power PlayAlberta with its digital sportsbook and solutions. To that end, the former party will supply its new partner with its proprietary fully-managed sportsbook solution that will dramatically improve the operator’s betting offering.</p>
<p>The migration of PlayAlberta’s online sportsbook to the BtoBet platform should wrap up in Q3 2023. The quick rollout is made possible by BtoBet’s impressive integration potential, speed-to-market capabilities and commitment to compliance. The two parties expect their partnership to expand at a fast pace.</p>
<p>PlayAlberta is an online gambling platform operated by Alberta Gaming, Liquor &amp; Cannabis. The operator is also the only legal online gambling website in the province. While BtoBet is new to Alberta, the brand already has a presence in Canada, having secured a license in Ontario in early 2023.</p>
<p>President Maimon Is Excited about the Deal</p>
<p>NeoGames’ president and head of iGaming, Tsachi Maimon, expressed his delight about the agreement between BtoBet and PlayAlberta. He said that the partnership agreement will benefit both parties and will expand and enhance the Albertan platform’s sports betting platform services.</p>
<p>Maimon said that “as a proven leader in sportsbook provision, BtoBet is confident that this collaboration with PlayAlberta will provide their players with the optimal betting entertainment they demand.” He added that the deal will power PlayAlberta with betting offerings for many important local leagues.</p>
<p>We are excited to usher in the next generation of betting experiences through localized betting offers, including offers for the Canadian Football League, the Premier Lacrosse League, and unique special bets for a variety of sports focused on Canadian athletes. Tsachi Maimon, president &amp; head of iGaming, NeoGames</p>
<p>NeoGames’ sports betting division continues to expand its global presence. In addition to the deal with PlayAlberta, the company also expanded its alliance with PremierBet in Africa earlier this year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August, the company added Robert Wesley as vice president of North American customer development, further doubling down on its efforts in the NA marker. At the same time, the company continues to maintain a strong presence in Europe, where it recently signed a deal with LEIA.</p>
