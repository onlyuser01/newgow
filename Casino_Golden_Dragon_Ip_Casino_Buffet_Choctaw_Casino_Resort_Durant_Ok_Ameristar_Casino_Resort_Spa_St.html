    <h1>Casino Golden Dragon Ip Casino Buffet Choctaw Casino Resort Durant Ok Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St</h1>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>We had the chance to review Timo's account and we would like to share with you the following:</p>
<p>Before we get into particulars, the Casino expects all potential players to read all the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We see that Timo's winnings were confiscated as the gameplay broke the General terms and conditions:</p>
<p>https://www.nordicasino.com/general-terms-conditions/?lang=en</p>
<p>"10.Betting Rules</p>
<p>10.1. The casino expects you to follow the rules of each game while playing at the casino. We reserve the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate the winnings and bonuses for violation of the Betting Rules.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>10.3. Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play is prohibited. Acquiring an in-game Buy Feature to trigger free spins for a buy-in cost equal to or over the 30% max bet limit is considered as irregular play."</p>
<p>On 23 of December 2021, Timo started his gaming session with a deposit of 25 euros. He commenced his gameplay and placed bets on "Christmas Big Bass Bonanza™" - a slots game. He breached the 30% betting rules when he placed 55 bets ranging from 10 to 100 Euros on the said slots game.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the withdrawal was declined and winnings were confiscated. Evidence to support our claims can be provided.</p>
<p>Please be advised that we view "over-betting" as a violation of the service we provide, and an attempt to deal unfairly with us. If a player attempts that, confiscation of the winnings accrued is in order. Of course, you might claim that you were uninformed and that you meant no harm. We are always careful to return to the balance the deposit from which the confiscated winnings were accrued, even though, technically, we don’t have to do that.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Timo had received an email from one of the casino operators where he had explained to Timo about his irregular bets.</p>
<p>In a matter of fact, Timo didn't reply to this email nor did he send a new one.</p>
<p>The Casino understands Timo's frustration, but it is imperative that all players comply with the terms and conditions that a player agrees to upon opening an account.</p>
<p>We hope it is clear and we wish you the best of luck in your future.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Nordi Casino</p>
