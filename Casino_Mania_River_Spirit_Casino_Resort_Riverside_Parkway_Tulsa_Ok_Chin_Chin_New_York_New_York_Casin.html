    <h1>Casino Mania River Spirit Casino Resort Riverside Parkway Tulsa Ok Chin Chin New York New York Casin</h1>

<p>I deposited about $32 or .014 of Ethereum crypto to Bovada.</p>
<p>While waiting for the deposit to show up, the website shut down for maintenance. It did not come back up until 6 AM the following day.</p>
<p>When I logged in, my funds weren't there.</p>
<p>The first online help/chat person assured me that my funds were deposited but that there was just a "hiccup" in the system.</p>
<p>They "escalated" the issue and said I'd hear back in 24-48 hrs.</p>
<p>I logged back in 12 hours later and funds still weren't there.</p>
<p>The second online help/chat person filed a "report" and "escalated" the issue as well.</p>
<p>When I told them that I did not want to wait 48 hours and wanted to chat with a manager, they refused repeatedly.</p>
<p>I logged back in more than 30 hours later and my funds still weren't there.</p>
<p>The third chat person said that my funds weren't accepted because my deposit was less than $50!</p>
<p>He sent a link to their policy which says the same thing as the notice on the deposit webpage and was something I was aware of, "Ethereum deposits less than 0.01 ETH will not be honored."</p>
<p>I explained to "Andy B." that my deposit was .014 and above the required amount of .01 but the mathematics must have been too complicated because he did not understand and again refused to let me chat with a manager!</p>
<p>I read their terms of service and under "Acceptance of Deposit" it says, "we shall notify you if your Deposit Request is rejected."</p>
<p>Well, I was never notified officially of that by email.</p>
<p>So I guess, to sum it up, I got robbed by Bovada.</p>
