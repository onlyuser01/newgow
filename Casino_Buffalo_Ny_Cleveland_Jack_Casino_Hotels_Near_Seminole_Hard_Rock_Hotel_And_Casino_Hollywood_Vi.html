<p>Agilysys, the company behind what it claims to be the “broadest integrated hospitality software portfolio,” has inked an agreement with a Mohegan-owned casino. Under the deal, the software specialist will supply the Mohegan Tribe’s property in Korea with its proprietary hospitality systems.</p>
<p>Agilysys will Power Mohegan Inspire</p>
<p>The Mohegan Inspire Resort is still in the process of being built. Once it’s finished, Agilysys will power the venue with its strong portfolio of hospitality systems, helping its customers enjoy quality experiences.</p>
<p>Mohegan Inspire Resort is planned to open in 2023. The venue cost $5 billion to build and is a huge investment on the Mohegan Tribe’s side. It will have a hotel with 1,300 luxury rooms, as well as a 20,000-square-meter casino. Mohegan Inspire is located an hour away from Seoul, making it an attractive destination for gambling tourists from Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>For Agilysys, this agreement is a perfect opportunity to grow its presence in Asia and promote its products in the region. In fact, this new deal will be the first time the hospitality software company has worked together with an Asian casino.</p>
