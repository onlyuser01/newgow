    <h1>Casablanca Resort Casino Golf And Spa Gta Casino Real Casino Games Online Mackinaw City Casino Pione</h1>

<p>Dear Steven.</p>
<p>With my growing indignation, I re-read your comment regarding my complaint. In the same way, I resented when I had a dialogue with your specialist in the support chat. You, like him, stand your ground and do not recognize the obvious - namely: your violation, as a certified casino, of all written and unwritten rules of gambling, especially in international markets. Your demeanor in particular and the policy of the company as a whole do not lend themselves to any criticism. Your lies and excuses, even here, in front of witnesses, once again prove that your actions are fraudulent.</p>
<p>I'll start with the last one, with your remark about my supposedly connected double accounts in your casino. It's a lie. I am sure that I did not register earlier, specifically at Kudos Casino. There is a possibility of registration in the related casinos of your iNetBet group. I'm afraid you rather mean them. I will answer: - I DO NOT HAVE A SECOND OR THIRD ACCOUNT IN KUDOS CASINO.</p>
<p>I would like to note that everyone has already repeatedly re-read the essence of my claim several times, so I wonâ€™t repeat what happened for what, we already know this. Therefore, I will simply ask you as a person with pragmatic and balanced thinking: - FOR WHAT SIGNS AND WHAT MY ACTIONS DO I, AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION OF A PROFILE IN KUDOS CASINO AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS WITH THE ISSUANCE OF BONUS CHIPS TO ME AND THEIR SUCCESSFUL WINING, YOUR TEAM SPECIAL AM A RULES BREAKER AND WILL MY WINNINGS BE CONFISCATED? THE CHAT SUPPORT AGENT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ESTABLISH IF I AM REALLY A RESIDENT OF UKRAINE AND CHECK MY DOCKS? I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE UNDER YOUR RULES I MUST BE A RESIDENT IN ONE OF THE LISTED COUNTRIES. And for example, at the time of registration of the profile in this country, while being a native, for example, the Russian Federation, its citizen and performing official duties at the territory of Ukraine on the address specified in the profile, without preliminary check, do not give you reason to believe that I VIOLATOR. Without making sure of my documents, without the KYC procedure, just smoothly and looked around with me, slandered and absolutely delicately (with me for the first time) arrived brazed, unethical, without proper compliance with customer service rules anulated my honest winnings and threw me away. BY WHAT CRITERIA DID YOU DETERMINE THAT I CONSCIOUSLY WENT TO VIOLATION OF THE RULES?; QUOTING MY LINES FROM CORRESPONDENCE, WHERE ARE THESE FACTS GIVING YOU GROUNDS TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF MY WRONG ACTIONS? WHO EVER GAVE YOU SUCH A RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT I PURPOSE TO DECEIVE YOU BY PLAYING WITH THE CHIPS YOU GIVEN?</p>
<p>DESPITE ALL, YOUR REPRESENTATIVE, NOT CONFIRMED OF MY BELONGING TO ONE OF THE PROHIBITED COUNTRIES, UNREASONALLY TAKEN 150 US DOLLARS FROM ME. PLEASE RETURN THEIR BALANCE WITH THE RENEWAL OF THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in fact, I, in turn, determined that some actions of players in your casino are suppressed by the system and are not acceptable. I made such a conclusion when I received a refusal when ordering a bonus coupon found on a third-party site. "You are not allow to redeem this coupon due to the territorial restrictions" - this is exactly the notification I received after the no deposit bonus claim was tedious.</p>
<p>It was not in my mind to deceive or deliberately violate anyone when, 5 minutes later, I opened the Casino Notice in my profile with clear instructions on how to proceed. When I entered the promo code you suggested and when the coupon activated, I was sure that it was legal. Based on the bad experience with the first promotional code, I decided that if this could not be done, then the system simply would not allow this.</p>
<p>Conclusion: from all the scaros described: and not intentionally, does your firm-casino go on such errors in the work of the system, offering bonuses and approve of the players' requests for this bonus (for confirmation of the player's email) to then, in the event of a wager, players, players WE MADE YOU REAL DEPOSITS WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE RULES, WILL NOT BE APPLIED TO A WAGER AT ALL. THE MARKING OF THIS DEPOSIT WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE CASINO AS A PURELY TECHNICAL MOMENT OF DETERMINING THE METHOD FOR THE FURTHER WITHDRAWAL OF ANY FUNDS FROM THE PLAYER'S BALANCE. SUCH POINT IS CLEARLY AND TRANSPARENTLY WRITTEN BY YOUR RULES.</p>
<p>I will note, by the way, that there are more than one of your rules to still find on the site, so more and legal ambiguity together with the ambiguous subtext of the rules of the program prohibitions from a number of countries suggest me on the thoughts on a specially tricky scheme of the players' layout on obtaining bonuses possible WHEN THE LUCKY WINNER MAKES A CONDITIONAL DEPOSIT, IN ORDER TO THEN INFORM THAT HE IS AN INFRINGEMENT AND CANCEL ALL MONEY, IS NOT EXCLUDED AND TOGETHER WITH THAT DEPOSIT MADE. YOU KNOW THAT. AND THIS IS HERE I MAY HAVE TO STOP A COMMA AND HEAR YOUR ANSWER, MR. STEVEN.</p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.</p>
<p>G<strong><em> Sergey P</em></strong></p>
