Plus, you will witness a +1 multiplier be applied to all high-paying symbols or Wheelspin Wild symbols that have already experienced conversion.</p>

<p>Keep an Eye on the Special Nitro Wilds</p>
<p>When special Nitro Wild symbols are seen landing on reels from one to five together with scatter symbols placed on reels from two to four, players can prepare for the Super Free Spins. During it, any Wheelspin Wilds that will land will be locked in position, turning high-paying symbols into wild symbols landing to their left. All symbols converted by Wheelspin Wilds will also feature a +1 multiplier.</p>
<p>Players eager to jump straight into the bonus round can purchase the Buy Feature in those markets powered by Relax gaming that are compatible with the feature.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon described the game as a “high-octane slot” expected to make even “the tamest Sunday drivers” happy. He also expressed confidence in Hot Rod Racers’ ability to turn into a “huge hit” among players. In September, Relax Gaming listed Thunderkick as its latest partner for the Powered By program. During the same month, the studio won SBC’s Innovation in Casino Entertainment award. In April 2022, the company opened a new studio in Novi Sad in order to “make room for more creativity” in its quest focused on driving differentiation in the industry.</p>
