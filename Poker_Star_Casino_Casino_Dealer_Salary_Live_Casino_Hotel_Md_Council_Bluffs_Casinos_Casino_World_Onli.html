<p>The deal with 10bet was described as a huge moment for Playtech by the latter company’s chief operating officer</p>
<p>Playtech, a leading supplier of gaming tech, has unveiled a new partnership agreement with 10bet, a global iGaming brand. The partnership will see the former company supply its new partner’s business in the United Kingdom and Sweden with sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>10bet is a leading gambling company that boasts a loyal customer base of over a million players. Thanks to its engaging features and drive for innovation, the operator attracts new customers each day.</p>
<p>As a company that is dedicated to maintaining top-notch quality, 10bet recognizes the importance of technology and has decided to pick Playtech as its sole provider of sportsbook tech in the UK. The new deal will benefit both companies and will solidify Playtech’s position as a leading provider.</p>
<p>At the same time, Playtech will expand in the Swedish market, where it recently expanded its deal with Svenska Spel. Under the current agreement, Playtech will supply 10bet with its Player Management System, Playtech Open Platform and other tools. Sweden recently decided to regulate gambling and sports betting suppliers, requiring them to have a license before they can operate in the market.</p>
<p>Playtech noted that the current agreement with 10bet demonstrates the increased demand for sports betting – a vertical that is a top priority for the supplier.</p>
<p>The Deal Represents a Huge Moment for Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech’s chief operating officer, Shimon Akad, shared his thoughts on the partnership with 10bet. He said that his team is happy to join forces with the operator and expand its presence in the UK and Sweden.</p>
<p>Akad described the deal as a “huge moment” for the company’s sportsbook offering.</p>
<p>This partnership is a huge moment for our sportsbook offering, and we are very excited to see what both of these key markets, Sweden and the UK, bring to Playtech and 10bet. This is only the beginning of our relationship, and the opportunities are endless. Shimon Akad, COO, Playtech</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yuval Klein, a spokesperson for 10bet, said that the deal with Playtech is “truly remarkable.” The partnership, according to him, will greatly enhance his company’s sports betting offering in the UK.</p>
<p>This partnership delivers top-tier experiences, advanced player protection tools, and sparks UK sports betting. It’s a win-win situation, fostering growth for both 10bet and Playtech, while providing our fans with an exceptional sports betting experience. Yuval Klein, spokesperson, 10bet</p>
<p>Finally, Klein said that his team is “wholeheartedly dedicated” to the current partnership and is looking forward to the future.</p>
<p>Playtech recently reported a strong start to 2023, highlighting its B2B and B2C growth. The report came a few days after the company penned a strategic deal with DAZN Bet.</p>
