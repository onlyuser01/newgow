<p>It’s time for the Battle of LA! The first Clippers vs. Lakers duel of the 2023-24 NBA season is on the program on Wednesday, November 1, at Crypto.com Arena</p>
<p>Our Clippers vs. Lakers prediction is that this is going to be a hell of a game. The Lakers lead the all-time series 104–63, but in their last 11 duels, it’s the Clippers that won. Plus, in the 2023-24 season, the Clippers look capable of beating almost anyone in the league.</p>
<p>The only issue ahead of the Battle of Los Angeles on November 1 is that the Clippers have had less than 24 hours to rest after the clash with the Orlando Magic.</p>
<p>Clippers vs. Lakers Odds</p>
<p>Spread Odds Los Angeles Clippers +3 -110 Los Angeles Lakers -3 -110</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Los Angeles Clippers +170 Los Angeles Lakers -200</p>
<p>Points Total Odds Over 226.5 -110 Under 226.5 -110</p>
<p>*Odds taken from FanDuel on Wednesday, November 1.</p>

<p>Clippers Hoping for Their 12th Straight Win Over the Lakers</p>
<p>Even though the Lakers have been significantly more successful than the Clippers, the “other LA team” has won each of their last eight duels in the NBA. These guys have every right to hope for another great result as in 2023, their roster looks even better than last year.</p>
<p>James Harden and Russell Westbrook have now teamed up at THREE different franchises! pic.twitter.com/LIrr49E8h1 — Basketball Forever (@bballforever_) October 31, 2023</p>
<p>It’s mainly because they now have James Harden. He probably won’t play as he’s just inked a deal with the Clippers but his old friend, Russell Westbrook almost certainly will.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old guard joined the Clippers in February, doing alright in the final couple of months of last season’s NBA campaign. This time, however, Westbrook is expected to have an even bigger impact on the Clippers.</p>
<p>But even such a talented player as Westbrook isn’t the key man of the Clippers in the 2023-24 season. Instead, this team’s been all about Paul George. Westbrook’s teammate from the Oklahoma City Thunder days has been in a scoring mood since the start of the season, the same as Kawhi Leonard.</p>
<p>Lakers are Ready for the Battle of Los Angeles</p>
<p>The Clippers vs. Lakers odds suggest LeBron &amp; Co. need to be thought of as the favorites in the November 1 game. The reason is that they’ve been brilliant since the start of the season, both offensively and defensively.</p>
<p>King James is the oldest active NBA player, but he’s not showing any signs of slowing down. He’s big and strong, and almost impossible to stop. And in the 2023-24 season, he’s diligent on the defense. The same goes for most of his teammates, including Anthony Davis, D’Angelo Russell, and others.</p>
<p>But if the Lakers have been so good, how come they’re 2-2 on the season? Well, their first loss happened in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets. Their second loss of the season happened against the Sacramento Kings after overtime.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Clippers vs. Los Angeles Lakers Prediction</p>
<p>Our Clippers vs. Lakers prediction is that this is going to be a very close game, the winner of which will be decided by only a couple of points. So, which team will it be? We think it’s time for the Lakers to finally beat their city rivals. LeBron &amp; Co. have had plenty of time to rest and prepare for this game, so it’s really a perfect opportunity for them to beat the Clippers for the first time since 2020.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Lakers to win</p>
