<p>Six days after Real Madrid defeated Chelsea 3-1 in London, the two meet again. Leg 2 of their Champions League quarterfinal takes place at Santiago Bernabeu in the Spanish capital.</p>
<p>The reigning UCL champions need to try and beat Los Blancos in Madrid. And they need a big win! However, oddsmakers don’t think they’re going to pull it off. In fact, they believe it’s more likely we’ll see Real winning again.</p>

<p>All Eyes on Karim Benzema</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s no.9 might be the very best striker on the planet at the moment. The 34-year-old Frenchman has scored 37 goals in the 36 matches he’s played for Real Madrid in all competitions this season. Eleven of those happened in the Champions League, where he played eight matches.</p>
<p>The most impressive fact about his UCL scoring tally is that he’s scored a hat-trick in the previous two games. First, he did it against PSG; then he scored three times at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.</p>
<p>In-between those games, Benzema played another two La Liga matches, scoring a total of four goals. Knowing all this, the attacker looks unstoppable.</p>
<p>Still, in Tuesday’s game, Real Madrid’s defenders are the ones that need to step up. They need to make sure Chelsea doesn’t score too many goals.</p>
<p>The Blues Need to Attack with All They Got</p>
<p>Chelsea needs a 2-0 win only to take the game to the extra time. Only a victory with 3 or more goals margin would give Chelsea an instant ticket to the semifinals.</p>
<p>The trouble is that attack hasn’t been Chelsea’s strongest weapon over the last couple of weeks. Although they did score a goal in each of the four games leading to the UCL Leg 1, they didn’t score more than two goals in any of those matches.</p>
<p>The reason why that’s strange is that Chelsea’s opponents before the UCL game with Real were Newcastle, Lille, Middlesbrough, and Brantford.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>We probably aren’t going to see too many goals this time. It’s because Real Madrid is going to be even more focused on the defense than in Leg 1. Further, Chelsea forwards just don’t seem capable of scoring too many times against such a strong opponent.</p>
<p>Picks: Real Madrid and Chelsea to draw; Under 2.5 goals</p>
