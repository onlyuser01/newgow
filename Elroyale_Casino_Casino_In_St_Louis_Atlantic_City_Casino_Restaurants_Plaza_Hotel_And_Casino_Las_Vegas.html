    <h1>Elroyale Casino Casino In St Louis Atlantic City Casino Restaurants Plaza Hotel And Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Elys Game Technology, Corp will help its partner in Washington DC, Grand Central Restaurant and Sportsbook, to launch a second sportsbook location in the area. While the two companies have not released details about what location this may be, they are fairly confident in the success of this new venture. The new sportsbook is still subject to approval by the regulator, the DC Department of Small &amp; Local Business Developments, and the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming.</p>
<p>Second Sportsbook in the Works</p>
<p>According to Elys Game Technology executive chairman Michele Ciavarella welcomed the new opportunity and said that the company’s Management Services Provider license with Grand Central proved to be a pivotal moment for the betting industry in the United States. The launch of the original partner translated into a strong sports betting handle, Ciavarella remarked and said that this has served as the basis of the new partnership that is being worked on right now. Ciavarella added:</p>
<p>We believe our sportsbook solutions could play an important role in supporting the recovery of bars, restaurants, and other small businesses post-pandemic, and are witnessing very strong interest and demand for our solutions and our highly popular Build-Your-Bet feature for sports bettors. Elys Game Technology executive chairman Michele Ciavarella</p>
<p>The executive also welcomed the existing support from the pertinent regulators and added that the two companies were now looking forward to making a second location a reality. This new location should further empower customers in Washington DC and provide them with the opportunity to have more options to choose from.</p>
<p>It’s also a signal that the sports betting industry is continuing to improve and that no repeat of the COVID-19 shutdowns is expected, emboldening others to pursue business ventures of their own. While online sports betting is the name of the game today, interest in land-based sports betting is not subsiding in the slightest.</p>
