<p>Transylvania Night of Blood review</p>
<p>Transylvania Night of Blood is a vampire-themed slot that centres on a werewolf and a vampire doing battle one fateful night in Transylvania. The slot provides us with a brief introduction when it loads up, introducing us to the key characters and setting the stage for the showdown on the reels.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>When you think of vampire slots, it’s hard not to think of the iconic Immortal Romance, but Red Tiger has actually made a little bit of a niche for these titles too. Transylvania Night of Blood bares a close resemblance to Dracula Awakening, another vampire-themed offering from the developer.</p>
<p>A full moon rises as the opening plays out, and the reels are situated inside Dracula’s castle. A silver glisten spreads around the border, with candles, chalices full of blood, a dagger, and a gun with a silver bullet making up some of the symbols on the grid.</p>
<p>It’s an effective design that helps immerse players into the world that this slot occupies. A spooky soundtrack also plays while the reels are spinning, with the faint sound of crows and the occasional howl adding to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Transylvania Night of Blood slot game uses six reels and four rows. The game has 4,096 ways to win, with winning combinations being made of matching symbols landing on adjacent rows.</p>
<p>The stake, autospin and turbo play options are all found under the reels. The latter of these is not available in all locations.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The battle between the werewolf and the vampire is key to the Transylvania Night of Blood bonus features. Both the werewolf and vampire have modifiers that can be triggered on any random spin.</p>
<p>The Vampire Bite can randomly select between two and ten positions on the middle four reels. Any symbols that land in a bitten position will instantly turn Wild.</p>
<p>The Werewolf Scratch is similar in that it also chooses between two to ten positions on random positions across the reels. Any symbols that land in these positions are given a Ways Multiplier up to 10x. The symbol is then counted as that multiple for any wins.</p>
<p>Like the modifiers, there are two free spins bonuses as well. The Vampire Free Spins are triggered when you land two Vampire Scatters. Seven spins are given, with an increased chance of the Vampire Bite occurring on each spin. The Werewolf Spins do the same for the Werewolf Scratch, with two Werewolf Scatters needed to trigger the round.</p>
<p>Landing a Vampire and Werewolf Scatter at the same time will trigger Seven Battle Spins. During this round, both modifiers land at an increased rate and they can also land at the same time.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Transylvania Night of Blood slot has a return to player of 95.76%, which puts it just below average but far from bad. We always recommend spinning highly volatile slots in our slot strategy, and Transylvania Night of Blood falls into that category. The slot offers a solid maximum win of 7,439x your stake.</p>
<p>Clicking the stake button in the bottom corner will allow you to adjust your stake. The minimum bet is $0.10 and the maximum is $10, making this an ideal slot for those with smaller budgets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Transylvania Night of Blood is a fun vampire-themed offering from Red Tiger. Fans of Dracula Awakening and other vampire-themed offerings from the provider will find that there is plenty to sink their teeth into, and the two different modifiers and bonuses keep things interesting. The 7,439x maximum win also helps to sweeten the deal.</p>
