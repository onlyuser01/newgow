    <h1>Ameristar Council Bluffs Casino Philadelphia Casinos Casino Charlotte Nc All Casino Action Youtube I</h1>

<p>hi there,</p>
<p>big complaint here towards casinochan. i have won the amount of around $35,000 aud and prior to me winning this, when i signed up for this casino i instantly uploaded my documents for verification so it was ready to go if i won and could withdraw easily. now i asked the agent at the time if my account was ok, no issues with the account, am i ok to depoist. he stated yes sir enjoy your casino experience and thank you for choosing casinochan etc etc. i thought everything was goddam good up until today 2/3/22 i won $35,000 without no bonus at all ( i dont accept bonuses, i always cancel this in my options. they kept refusing my withdrawl, then they said its been approved should be in my bank account 3-5days then they are saying i have a duplicate account/users mutli users on the same ip???? (WTF WOW) wait it gets better, they are also saying the accounts that are using the same ip doesnt have to be in my name either??? im so confused, for example " are they saying no one can play in your house hold besides you? " i have transcripts for my evidence backing me up. they cannot provide me no proof that i have a duplicate account. i have told them only account i have is with PLAYAMO CASINO shouldnt be linked to CASINOCHAN. they cannot give me a straight awnser to why they stole my winnings. these people are scammers they dont warn you for duplicate accounts, they dont check on sign up if you have a duplicate account. they throw it in your face when you win of course so they can rob you and the providers.</p>
<p>so guys basicallly not paying my winnings that i put my hard cash into and won from my own legit money not there sh** bonuses. $35,000 is alot of money for me as i am a big player, i do massive bets and yes i loose but i win. for them to just take my money not providing no proof and yet approving me at 1 point then saying no is complete robbery. i want to go far with this, it isnt fair on players, the stress i have from all this isnt something i want anyone to feel.</p>
<p>casino guru i have all legs to stand on here please help me recover what i earned and not thrown to the gutter after i won.</p>
