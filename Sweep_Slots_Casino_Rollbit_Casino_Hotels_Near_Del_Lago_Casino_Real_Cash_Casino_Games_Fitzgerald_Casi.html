<p>Bally’s Corporation, aiming to secure one of the limited New York casino licenses, has quickly adapted to shifting public sentiments</p>
<p>As former President Donald J. Trump’s civil fraud trial entered its closing arguments in Manhattan, a notable change occurred at the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx. The golf course, now under new management by Bally’s Corporation, underwent a rebranding event attended by Mayor Eric Adams, revealing an updated sign that reads “BALLY LINKS.”</p>
<p>The Golf Course Remains a Valuable Asset</p>
<p>Mayor Adams, a Democrat critical of Trump, refrained from making any direct comments about the former President but emphasized the change as an opportunity to enhance tourism in the Bronx. According to the New York Times, many New York Democrats welcomed this management transition, hoping to curtail the former President’s influence in the city.</p>
<p>Let’s make sure this is a turning of a corner of the greatness of the great borough with great people that have great expectations. Eric Adams, New York mayor</p>
<p>This move signifies another step in Trump’s withdrawal from New York City, where he once had a prominent presence as a businessman and celebrity. Bally’s Corporation acquired the license to operate the 180-acre golf course, a property the city had unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim from Trump’s company. The agreement stipulated the property would no longer hold the former President’s name.</p>
<p>Despite Bally’s announcing the deal with the Trump Organization in September 2023, the lease transfer did not occur until November. The $60 million price was lower than many industry experts estimated. The 18-hole links-style golf course offers stunning views of the skyline of New York City, delivering unique experiences for its visitors.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation is eyeing a casino bid at the Bronx site, hoping to secure one of up to three casino licenses in the New York City area. As the race for New York City casino permits intensifies, potential operators face a high-stakes gamble, leveraging all their resources to offer a better proposition than their competitors.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation hopes that by distancing itself from the Trump name, it can fully leverage the golf course’s unique advantages, avoiding the negative implications associated with its former owner. The rebranded property joins other projects in the city that have shed the Trump brand, including hotels and apartment buildings.</p>
<p>The rebranding of the golf course reflects a broader trend of Trump’s diminishing influence and visibility in various sectors, marking a shift in the city’s landscape and business associations. As Trump’s popularity wanes in certain circles, companies and organizations are recalibrating their associations to align with changing public sentiments, seeking to avoid damage to their reputation.</p>
