<p>Maya U Max review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game is themed around ancient Mayan culture and precious gems.</p>
<p>Players will stumble into an adventure as they explore a mythical Mayan temple. On a set of stone reels they will find treasures from jewels to gold.</p>
<p>This slot is a good choice for players who enjoy Aztec-themed slots or other South American- style games. The portrayal of the artifacts leans into fantasy rather than archeology, but this suits the magical atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a haunting melody that adds a mysterious ambiance to the game. This music creates an ominous feeling, as displeasing the gods might have great consequences. However, the reels spin to entirely different music that feels more like something that would be played at a holiday resort party.</p>
<p>The two styles of music conflict, which may leave some players uncertain about the game’s tone.</p>
<p>The game is set in an eerie temple, with lanterns behind the reels lending a moody lighting. The reels themselves seem to be crafted from rock and are filled with emerald, sapphires, and gold. These treasures are animated in luminous hues that definitely look tempting. The treasures radiate light upon wins, highlighting their precious nature.</p>
<p>Also among the symbols are letters and numbers carved with ornate designs that seem to reference ancient Mayan aesthetics.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Maya U Max has a five reel, three row base structure. However, due to the special features of this game, additional clusters of symbols may be added to the reels from above.</p>
<p>Payouts are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spins symbol and the U Max symbol.</p>
<p>The U Max symbol grows larger when it lands on the reels, giving players a greater number of chances to win.</p>
<p>If players land 5 Free Spins symbols anywhere on the reels, 5 Free Spins will be awarded.</p>
<p>Should players land additional Free Spins symbols, this will award them an additional free spin for every symbol landed.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, players will be awarded +1 free spins for every additional Free Spins symbol they land.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature may be retriggered without limit.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.69%, somewhat below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€ up to a maximum of $/£/€ per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, which makes it a moderate match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium-high volatility Mayan-themed slot.</p>
<p>With the less-than-impressive RTP and volatility that is moderate players, this game misses the ideal mark for strategy-minded players.</p>
<p>The animation is colourful and the South American theme offers attractive aesthetics, but these qualities do not overcome the game’s deficits.</p>
<p>Players hoping for a South American theme have a host of other options that also offer a better strategy profile.</p>
