    <h1>Illinois Casinos Gta Casino Wheel Of Fortune Casino Miami Casino Shooting Star Casino Mahnomen MostB</h1>

<p>You know we have explained our approach fairly and openly. The only thing you're doing is biting the hand, which may eventually help. Do you think this is wise?</p>
<p>Just accept that you need to stick with the complaint. Mind the 14-day process we informed you about. Since this time frame has not been met, in our eyes, it's too soon to investigate. Until you update your complaint with news, that would suggest otherwise. Do you catch my meaning?</p>
<p>Have you also noticed that many countries have a national banking holiday? I truly think you should calm yourself and stop being stupidly rude. üôè</p>
<p>Be assured that:</p>
<p>"If the complaint is justified and we are unable to resolve it, it is closed and categorized as being 'unresolved'. This happens when the casino either does not respond to us or refuses to do what we consider to be fair in that specific situation. You will not get your desired outcome but the complaint will be saved in our system, the casino will be punished with a lower rating from us and our review of the casino will warn other players of what happened. What's more, if the casino wants to improve its rating in the future, it will be forced to address the complaint, so there is a chance that your complaint will be resolved at a later date."</p>

<p>I hope you understand that the whole investigation needs to be concluded to decide whether something wrong was done. For an obvious reason, the safety index does not count unfinished complaints or unproven experiences posted on the forum. That would be truly irresponsible.</p>
<p>Try to be patient and cooperate through the complaint; this is what matters.</p>
