    <h1>The Durango Casino Wind Creek Casino Com Hotel Pueblo Amigo Plaza Casino Tijuana Shoshone Bannock Ca</h1>

<p>SlotMatrix has penned a new multistate content deal with betPARX, one of the biggest mobile casino and sports betting operators in the United States. Under the deal, EveryMatrix’s slot aggregation division will supply the gambling operator with a “comprehensive library” of games from tier-1 suppliers.</p>
<p>BetPARX will thus be able to immediately refresh its gambling offering and engage its customers with many new and relevant gambling titles. As agreed, SlotMatrix will supply content to the operator in New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In addition to supplying content, the aggregator will also fuel the betting brand’s growth with cross-product bonusing and gamification tools, such as tournaments and free spins. This will help betPARX channel more players toward its platform and retain its existing customers.</p>
<p>The current agreement follows an earlier deal that saw EveryMatrix leverage its CasinoEngine aggregation platform to integrate content from its in-house Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios into betParx.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix, as the name suggests, is EveryMatrix’s slots-focused division. It currently boasts more than 300 studio partners and over 22,500 games integrations. Its parent company, EveryMatrix, holds licenses in a number of North American markets, including New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, Connecticut and the Canadian province of Ontario. The company is also preparing for launch in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Bolster betPARX’s Business</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the deal, with Gil Bushkin, betPARX’s senior director of interactive marketing, highlighting his team’s ambition to incorporate “well-known, exciting, and highly sought-after game titles” into its product offering. He said that the current partnership agreement aligns with this very goal.</p>

<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president for the Americas, also commented on the deal, expressing his company’s delight about the current partnership extension. Nyman said that he is happy to be able to provide betPARX with a huge variety of content from cutting-edge online gaming studios.</p>
<p>Once live, EveryMatrix will provide free spins, tournaments, leaderboards and jackpot capabilities through our back office for multiple vendors, making it one of the most significant product disruptions in US iGaming to date. Erik Nyman, president Americas, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Nyman concluded that he is certain the new partnership will provide betPARX with an important player retention boost.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, EveryMatrix secured a safer gambling certification from the World Lottery Association.</p>
