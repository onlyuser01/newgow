    <h1>Casino Near Me With Slots Win A Day Casino Longhorn Casino And Hotel Restaurants At Foxwoods Casino</h1>

<p>Hi Nick!</p>
<p>The verification process has started on the 14th of August, Monday. It is difficult to find all the documents because Casinoin has closed my account for some reason. However, I check the e-mail for all the attachments I send to the casino and which are accepted and which are not. The casino has requested several different documents and I assume that the personal information and payment documents are accepted, but the problem came with the origin of the money.</p>
<p>I would like to put the documents here, but this is not private, so I can send the documents I have sent through another way if necessary.</p>
<p>The last time I talked to the casino, I told them that I would dispute the matter, because my friend's personal information does not belong to the casino. After this, the casino has closed my account and I received the following message from them:</p>
<p>"Hey</p>
<p>Please note that your account has been suspended for violating several clauses of the company's terms of use, ie: registration of multiple accounts, unfair play and suspicious activity.</p>
<p>The company's security department made this decision after a thorough investigation, which includes a detailed analysis of the account's gaming activity. The result of the investigation revealed the creation of more than one game account and dishonest play, which led to the permanent closure of the account and retention of funds in accordance with the following clauses in our terms of use:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a player attempts to open or has opened more than one account per website, all accounts may be blocked or closed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only one account per household, device, IP address, financial instrument is allowed. The Company may perform additional security checks to detect multiple accounts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fraud, multiple accounts, multiple participations, circumvention of anti-fraud measures and/or unauthorized access, participation in violation of bonus terms and conditions is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Company has the right, at its own discretion, to reject a customer who has committed fraud or falsified or attempted to falsify the participation process or the progress of any campaign, or has violated this agreement, bonus terms and/or special terms, or who, in the Company's reasonable opinion, may damage the Company's reputation and brand, or which reputation of any of our group companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you cannot register a new account in our system. Any new account you have created in our system will be blocked and all funds will be forfeited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the support team does not have the right to comment on such decisions of the security department."</p>
<p>This is strange because I haven't made multiple accounts for the casino?</p>
<p>You also asked about transfers between my friend and me, and the answer is no. The transfers between my friend and I have not been related to casino gambling. The transfers between my friend and I have been related to private life. For this reason, I don't feel obligated to send my friend's personal information to the casino. Evidence of this can be found in the following documents.</p>
<p>I hope my message clarified the situation and I await your reply!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>the codguy</p>
