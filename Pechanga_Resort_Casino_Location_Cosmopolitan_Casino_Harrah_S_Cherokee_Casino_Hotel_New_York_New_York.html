<p>Much has been said about sports betting in California this year. But what appears to be certain is that it is unlikely the residents of the state to support the proposals calling for the legalization of the activity. In that line of thought, a new report reveals that California Governor Gavin Newsom opposed one of the sports betting proposals that will be up for voting this November.</p>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom: Vote No on 27</p>
<p>Governor Newsom opposed Proposition 27, saying it is bad for the state, a new report released by Politico reveals. In addition, the Governor explained that the proposal will likely negatively impact the state’s Indian Tribes. At the same time, Governor Newsom predicted that Proposition 27 may increase the risks of underage gambling and funnel billions of dollars from Californians into the hands of organizations out of state. Last but not least, the Governor urged: “Vote No on 27.”</p>
<p>“Proposition 27 is bad for California. It would hurt California’s Indian Tribes, increase the risks of underage gambling, and push billions of dollars out of California and into the pockets of out-of-state corporations.“ Governor Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>There are two proposals that will be up for voting this November. One of them, Proposition 27, is supported by major gambling industry players. The proposal seeks to legalize online sports betting and bring leading operators such as FanDuel, DraftKings and BetMGM. On the other hand, Proposition 26, is backed by Tribal operators in California. The proposal seeks to introduce retail sports betting for the state’s tribal casinos and four horse racing tracks.</p>
<p>The two proposals clashed in California which resulted in a local multi-million “war,” considering that the involved parties have spent more than $400 million to support their propositions. This local competition for the support of each of the measures proved to be one of the most expensive ballot initiatives in the US to date.</p>
<p>The Proposals Are Unlikely to Pass, Says Study</p>
<p>While Tribal and commercial operators spent millions to support their initiatives, the results of a recent study revealed that voters are unlikely to support any of the sports betting pitches. The study revealed that 31% of the likely voters may support Proposition 26, while 42% would likely be against it. In other words, more people are likely to vote in opposition to the proposal than to support it. A similar was the result for Proposal 27. The study said that 53% of the likely voters would vote against the sports betting proposal, while only 27% are likely to support it.</p>
