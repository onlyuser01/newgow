<p>The last race of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series regular season is on the program on Sunday, August 27</p>
<p>The 2023 Coke Zero Sugar 400 race is the final event of the regular season of this year’s NASCAR Cup Series, and the last chance for some elite drivers to book a ticket to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Just 16 drivers will get to the postseason, meaning that we could possibly see some real legends of the sport – Chase Elliott, AJ Allmendinger, Austin Cindric, and others – fail to qualify for the 2023 NASCAR Playoffs.</p>
<p>Coke Zero Sugar 400 Odds</p>
<p>Driver Odds Chase Elliott +1100 Kyle Busch +1200 Brad Keselowski +1200 Ryan Blaney +1200 Joey Logano +1200 William Byron +1600 Chris Buescher +1600 Martin Truex Jr. +1800</p>
<p>*Odds taken from FanDuel on Wednesday, August 23, 2023.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida</p>
<p>: Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida Date : Sunday, August 27, 2023</p>
<p>: Sunday, August 27, 2023 Time : 3:00 PM</p>

<p>Chase Elliott Needs to Win on Sunday to Get to the Playoffs</p>
<p>The winner of the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series had big plans for the 2023 season, but it started disappointingly for him. He finished 38th in the first race of the season, which took place at Daytona International Speedway, the same place where the one on Sunday will be held. The reason behind it was that a crash happened at Stage 2, which knocked him, as well as Erik Jones, and Tyer Reddick out of the race.</p>
<p>If Chase Elliott and Alex Bowman fail to win at Daytona, it would mark the 1st time since 2016 that only 2 Hendrick drivers would make the playoffs.</p>
<p>It would also mark only the 5th time since the Chase was implemented that Hendrick would have less than 3 drivers in the playoffs. pic.twitter.com/T3C3S7ggDM — BMG12 (@BigMikeGwood12) August 23, 2023</p>
<p>Eliott bounced back straight away, finishing second in the second race of the season, but then had to miss the following six races due to suspension and an injury. He missed another race a few months later, which explains why he hasn’t secured a place in the postseason.</p>
<p>The good news for him is that he still has a chance to get to the 2023 Playoffs. However, that can only happen if he does well on Sunday.</p>
<p>Drivers Who Could Ruin Elliott’s Plans on Sunday</p>
<p>Bookies see Elliott as the No. 1 favorite to win the Coke Zero Sugar 400, with NASCAR odds of +1100. However, there are another four drivers with only slightly longer odds. Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, and Ryan Blaney are each priced at +1200 because they all need a good result on Sunday to ensure they get to the postseason.</p>
<p>Then, there’s Martin Truex Jr., who’s already got himself a place in the 2023 NASCAR Playoffs, but who’s arguably the best driver, with the best car this season.</p>
<p>2023 Coke Zero Sugar 400 Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that the 2023 Coke Zero Sugar 400 is going to be one of the most exciting races of the entire NASCAR season. Everyone is motivated to do their best on August 27, which is why we could see some upsets happening.</p>
<p>Chase Elliott is the main favorite, a driver who hasn’t won a single race this season and we don’t think he will change that in the final event of the regular season. Instead, we suspect Joey Logano might do it. He too needs a good result, but unlike Elliott, he usually does well at Daytona. Further, the fact that he’s last season’s champ means that he’s got the skillset to win such an important race as the 2023 Coke Zero Sugar 400.</p>
<p>Pick: Joey Logano to win</p>
