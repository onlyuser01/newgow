    <h1>Isle Casino Hotel Waterloo Akwesasne Mohawk Casino How To Play Casino Games Mc Luck Casino Hustler C</h1>

<p>I was playing playing plinko while screen recording for close to an hour on September 7th 2023,</p>
<p>at $5 a ball when my balance was at 168 to getting an error message saying that there were to many request. When i refreshed my page it showed a $751 balance then it quick went down to $4.20 with out anything being touched. When I brought it to supports attention with the video evidence I originally brought it up for 165 dollars going missing and was told that my missing balance was due to multiple devices which I am only logged in on one device, but I had a buddy over who has his own account, who was not playing at the time this happened. Then blamed the missing balance on drops that I had done like half an hour before hand of 20 and 40 dollars but I was watching my balance the whole time hence why I switched to 5 dollar drops. Then I was told that they were going to escalate it to there tech team and when i asked how long that would take mary replied with idk, but she would be getting ahold of me. I waited 12 hours before asking if they found anything to which Support agent moe replied with they needed the round ID all of a sudden, so after going and finding the round ID Moe's informed of my larger bets from before when my balance was higher. That I had gone though that 164 dollars during that time and but i told him how is that possible cause that doesnt explain 8 ghost drops, that's when Support agent mary chimed in on the conversation saying that I had won 40 dollars on a 20 dollar bet. Then moe goes on to tell me I did a 3.20 bet after placing a $5 bet and said there was nothing they could do for me and my video evidence didn't mean anything.</p>
<p>I've attached the part of the video that shows my problem but will give the entire full length video if needed. I've also uploaded the support conversations and the round ID they requested.</p>
