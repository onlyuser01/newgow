<p>The leading business-to-business (B2B) technology and content provider for the iGaming industry, Relax Gaming, announced that its famous Dream Drop jackpot series made another lucky gambler a millionaire. Since the launch of Dream Drop just over a year ago, ten lucky gamblers secured life-changing awards. Now, this positive trend continues with Relax Gaming announcing the eleventh Dream Drop jackpot millionaire.</p>
<p>The company confirmed Monday that the lucky winner, becoming the eleventh millionaire, secured nearly €3 million ($3.2 million) while playing on Jackpothunter.com. Triggering the Dream Drop Mega Jackpot while playing Volatile Vikings Dream Drop, the lucky winner collected the staggering €2,976,908 ($3,152,066) after placing a wager that was only €2 ($2,12).</p>
<p>The recently secured Dream Drop win comes just four hours after a Major jackpot was won. The win represents an important milestone for Relax Gaming as the list of Dream Drop millionaires continues to grow.</p>
<p>A representative of Jackpothunter Casino explained that it is exciting to see one of its players become the new Dream Drop millionaire. “Everyone at Jackpothunter is excited to see such an impressive win happen on our platform, it validates where our brand is heading as we make winning jackpots easier,” added the representative. Finally, they spoke about the positive impact of the addition of Relax Gaming’s titles and the thrilling experiences they deliver for the operator’s growing customer base.</p>
<p>“It is truly a delight to be the casino that has played host to the eleventh Dream Drop Mega Jackpot winner,“ explains a statement released by Jackpothunter Casino</p>

<p>Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s CEO, was similarly thrilled regarding the multi-million-dollar win.
