    <h1>New Casinos Online Warhorse Casino Casino Chukchansi Bitcoin Casinos Aria Resort Casino Pool STATSCO</h1>

<p>The new additions come amid a talent drain that has seen multiple soccer legends migrate to Saudi Arabia’s top-flight soccer scene</p>
<p>A month after enhancing its live coverage with cutting-edge ads, STATSCORE, a leading provider of reliable sports data, live sports statistics and software, announced that it has expanded its soccer portfolio with the addition of betting data for certain Asian leagues. According to the company, the expansion will cover leagues with great growth potential.</p>
<p>STATSCORE explained that the new additions come amid a talent drain that has seen multiple soccer legends migrate to Saudi Arabia’s top-flight soccer scene. This includes notable athletes such as Christiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané, the data company explained.</p>
<p>As a result, STATSCORE decided to tap into some of Asia’s best soccer leagues and competitions, expanding its soccer portfolio with the addition of many beloved Asian leagues and competitions.</p>
<p>STATSCORE noted that the new products will be available for ordering by its partners via the ScoutsFeed product and the company’s live data widgets, like LivematchPro. The company emphasized that ScoutsFeed offers customizable coverage options that allow its partners to only include the matches it and its fans are interested in.</p>
<p>STATSCORE Continues to Expand Its Sports Coverage</p>
<p>STATSCORE’s product manager, Michał Kopciński, expressed his excitement about the expansion. He said that the new additions will allow his team to explore promising sports leagues with great room for growth.</p>
<p>The newest expansion will allow us to deliver more detailed data from venues for some unique football leagues, which have great potential for growth! Michał Kopciński, product manager, STATSCORE</p>
<p>Kopciński explained that his team is constantly working to expand the library of products available to its partners across the sports wagering and media sectors. He said that the company is excited about the opportunity to enhance its products with data from said Asian leagues and make its offerings even more attractive to potential partners.</p>
<p>Last month, STATSCORE signed an extension of its agreement with Fortuna 1 Liga, Poland’s second-tier soccer league. As a result, the former party solidified its position as the league’s official statistics partner, allowing it to continue distributing premium sports data.</p>
<p>Several days earlier, the company also launched a new cricket widget that allows operators to engage fans of the sport. Speaking of cricket, STATSCORE also agreed to cover the Cricket World Cup Qualifier with real-time data and added the Tamil Nadu Premier League to its cricket coverage.</p>
