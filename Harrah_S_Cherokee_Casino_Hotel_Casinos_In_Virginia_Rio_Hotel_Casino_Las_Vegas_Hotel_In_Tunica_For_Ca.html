<p>FanDuel Continues to Ride Its Momentum</p>
<p>The FanDuel FanFest marks the brand’s continuing efforts to expand its presence in Illinois. In February, the sportsbook announced its plans to open a new land-based venue at Chicago’s United Center stadium. The two-story space will have all the necessary equipment to provide a thrilling wagering experience. The operator is still working on obtaining an Illinois Gaming Board for its land-based project. In the meantime, FanDuel will host a non-wagering space in the United Center stadium central atrium. It will stream live sports events and help promote the upcoming sportsbook.</p>
<p>The operator is among the top performers in the USA, chiefly due to its deals with various leagues such as the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, EPL, WNBA, and PGA. The company has substantially increased its marketing efforts and currently dominates the national TV gambling ads with a 34% share of impressions. It has 17 million current customers and maintains a presence across all 50 states.</p>
