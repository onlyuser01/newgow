<p>The new launch with Soft Plus further expands CT Interactive's presence in the Italian iGaming market</p>
<p>Provider of gaming content and software solutions to the online gaming industry, CT Interactive, announced its Italian footprint has expanded after launches with two other brands of Slot Plus.</p>
<p>Strengthening Ties with Slot Plus</p>
<p>The existing agreement with the Italian operator Slot Plus saw CT Interactive going live with two additional brands in the online gaming market in the country – chescommessa.it and hcasino.it – further expanding its presence in Italy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Milena Tsankarska, head of Business Development of EMEA at CT Interactive, highlighted the company’s objective to offer its clients “products that will guarantee the best possible experience with the highest-quality gaming content.”</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the way our portfolio is accepted in the Italian market and that operators we have worked with in the past continue to reach for us and our new products,” she added, pleased to see that CT Interactive’s games are slowing but surely winning the hearts of Italian online casino players.</p>
<p>The launch of CT Interactive’s content with Slot Plus’ two other iGaming brands is further strengthening the ties between the games provider and the operator, following the last year’s content launch with Slot Plus’ main brand, Signor-Bet.it.</p>
<p>“Product excellence has always been our top priority; this is the reason why we are very selective when it comes to partners, we collaborate with,” commented the director of Slot Plus, Antonio Distante, outlining that “the award-winning games of CT Interactive managed to impress us with their striking designs, amazing sounds, and dynamics.</p>
<p>Their products have huge success with our clients, and this is why we continue to work with them. Antonio Distante, director of Slot Plus</p>
<p>Italy, Europe and Beyond</p>
<p>The launch with Slot Plus’ two other brands is the latest expansion of CT Interactive’s presence in the Italian iGaming market, following the content deal with MondoGaming in December. CT Interactive agreed to deliver 20 of its games and help the Italian operator boost its product offering.</p>
<p>Also in December, the Bulgarian-based content provider teamed with TimelessTech to expand its presence into new global markets, utilizing TimelessTech’s access to these markets due to the platform’s Curacao license.</p>
<p>There was another key development for CT Interactive in Italy, a market where it acquired its provider license in 2021, a month earlier when the casino content supplier received certification for 10 jackpot games.</p>
<p>In 2023, CT Interactive was particularly active, signing content agreements with European and global partners, including Belgian operator PepperMill Casino, Lithuanian iGaming operator 7bet.lt, and content aggregator QTech Games to expand its product reach into Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
