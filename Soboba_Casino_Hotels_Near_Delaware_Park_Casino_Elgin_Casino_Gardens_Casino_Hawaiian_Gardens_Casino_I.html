    <h1>Soboba Casino Hotels Near Delaware Park Casino Elgin Casino Gardens Casino Hawaiian Gardens Casino I</h1>

<p>I am shocked by their decision last week to confiscate all my winnings. I had made 2 deposits (80 and 120 mbtc) back in November and December. First I started losing and then all was fine. But at the end of December I went on a winning run and at the end I had a balance of 468mbtc. Then I wanted to request a withdrawal on 27th December of a part of my balance (150mbtc) but it was rejected. I was asked to submit KYC and I did. Then it took them a rediculous 22 days and I constantly kept asking why it was taking so long. And then last week, on 18th January I was told I could only withdraw my original 200mbtc deposit and that my 268mbtc of winnings were confiscated.</p>
<p>I am someone who clearly checks the rules before I join a website and I am 100% sure I did nothing against the rules:</p>
<p>I'm not from a forbidden country</p>
<p>I do not use VPN</p>
<p>I have not used any software</p>
<p>I have not bet on any dodgy leagues</p>
<p>I never took any deposit bonus</p>
<p>I do not have multiple accounts</p>
<p>This is the text they wrote to me:</p>
<p>You can withdraw the amount of your deposit, after that your account will be blocked forever.</p>
<p>In accordance with the rules:</p>
<p>7.5. coins.game reserves the right to reject a withdrawal request in case of fraud, in which case the account will be suspended and the payment will not be processed.</p>
<p>9.2 Collusion and fraud</p>
<p>Coins.game has the right to disable users' accounts and confiscate their account balances (including deposits and winnings) if they are found to be receiving, attempting to gain an advantage in trading their card information or colluding with other users to gain an unfair advantage. These advantages may include dropping and transferring chips, discussing hands during play, using the same account multiple times, soft play. Coins.game provides thorough game verification, both manual and automated, and investigates all related user complaints. In addition, coins.game provides proactive and random verification of gameplay and accounts.</p>
<p>9.3 Fraudulent Activity</p>
<p>Once coins.game notices fraudulent, illegal, dishonest or improper activity (including the use of a VPN, proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of your real location, or betting, wagering or playing poker through or on behalf of a third party) on the Website, we have the right to block a user's Account with forfeiture of all Account balances without prior notice. In such cases, coins.game reserves the right to report fraudulent activity to existing regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to banks, credit card companies and/or any person or entity legally entitled to such information, and/or to take legal action against such user.</p>
<p>I have little hope to get my funds back, this complaint is mostly to warn others. What a terrible disgusting scam website!</p>
