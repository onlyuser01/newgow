    <h1>Palm Springs Casinos Lake Charles L Auberge Casino Live Casino Hotel Maryland Hotels Near Pechanga C</h1>

<p>B2B iGaming software provider EveryMatrix has agreed to power 888casino with content from its brands. The former company will use CasinoEngine, its proprietary iGaming integration platform, to integrate its offer to 888casino.</p>
<p>The agreement covers games from EveryMatrix’s Armadillo and Spearhead Studios. Thanks to the popularity of 888casino, the provider’s content will reach countless bettors across the world.</p>
<p>Despite that, EveryMatrix’s main focus is to expand its footprint in the flourishing US market. EveryMatrix is already live in several US jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Michigan. In May, the company also acquired a license for West Virginia.</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios, one of the studios covered by the deal, will soon release The Lioness. The upcoming slot game pays homage to Amanda Nunes a top-level MMA fighter.</p>
<p>888 Welcomed the New Content</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president for the Americas, shared that he is very happy to pen a deal with 888. Nyman noted that the casino brand is “one of the largest and most experienced international gaming operators”, which will provide great opportunities for EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>This agreement will allow us to distribute our game content to a wider audience and we are looking forward to developing the relationship with 888 further. Erik Nyman, president for the Americas, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Talya Benyamini, vice president of B2C Casino at 888casino, said that her company is always striving to be a leader when it comes to content. To that end, the company will work with EveryMatrix and benefit from the cutting-edge content of its studios. Benyamini is sure that EveryMatrix will help 888casino achieve its ambitious goals.</p>
<p>Our commitment to our players to provide the highest quality games content across our portfolio continues to be at the center of everything we do. Talya Benyamini, VP B2C Casino, 888casino</p>
<p>A Busy Year for the Two Companies</p>
<p>This year has been an eventful one for EveryMatrix. At the beginning of this month, the company expanded its presence in Malta by agreeing to provide its National Lottery with online games. A few days prior to that, EveryMatrix penned a deal with BetMGM, agreeing to power its New Jersey offer with hit iGaming titles.</p>
<p>In June, the provider signed a quite interesting deal with Zitro. As per the agreement, EveryMatrix agreed to help Zitro digitalize many of its best retail games through the CasinoEngine platform.</p>
<p>888, on the other hand, was busy with the acquisition of the British operator William Hill. After successfully finalizing the deal, 888 introduced some changes to its team and added new members to its board.</p>
