<p>Data released by the gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), reveals that the Super Bowl resulted in $153.2 million in wagers for sportsbooks in the state</p>
<p>Overall, 185 sports books in the state accepted wagers on the Super Bowl. Although the result surpassed the amount wagered in 2021, it came short of Nevada’s record in Super Bowl wagers from 2022, which was $179.8 million in wagers. On the bright side, the $153.2 million in wagers from Super Bowl LVII was the fourth best result for sportsbooks in Nevada.</p>
<p>The Kansas City – Philadelphia game was responsible for a total of $153,183,002 in wagers this year, which brought them a 7.4% hold or $11,287,594 from the game. Not unexpectedly, the hold didn’t mark a record as well and was in fact the lowest since 2019, when the Super Bowl brought sportsbooks in Nevada $10.8 million with the same 7.4% hold.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger picture, recently, the leading geolocation service company, GeoComply, released a new report, pointing to significant growth in Super Bowl bets, in light of the recent event. The report acknowledged that an increase was observed within all different metrics related to sports wagering. Additionally, GeoComply acknowledged the positive impact of online betting activities. Those results come as no surprise, considering the popularity of sports betting, combined with the legalization of the activity in new states.</p>
<p>Super Bowl to Take Place in Las Vegas Next Year</p>
<p>NGCB’s chairman, Kirk Hendrick, explained that unaudited data points to $153.2 million in wagers and $11.3 million in winnings for sportsbooks from the Kansas City Chiefs’ 38-35 win against the Philadelphia Eagles from Super Bowl LVII. Finally, he acknowledged that the regulator is looking forward to the Super Bowl LVIII next year, which is set to take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Unaudited figures show a sportsbook win of $11,287,594 was recorded on wagers totaling $153,183,002. This resulted in a hold percentage of 7.4%. The Nevada Gaming Control Board looks forward to Allegiant Stadium hosting Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas next year.“ Kirk Hendrick, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board</p>
<p>While the latest result didn’t surpass the amount wagered last year, there are high hopes for next year’s Super Bowl. In fact, Chris Grove, a consultant for Eilers and Krejcik Gaming who was recently cited by the Nevada Independent, predicted that exponential growth of betting will be observed next year. Considering that the Super Bowl will take place in Las Vegas, the consultant predicted Nevada’s sportsbook may surpass $200 million in wagers.</p>
