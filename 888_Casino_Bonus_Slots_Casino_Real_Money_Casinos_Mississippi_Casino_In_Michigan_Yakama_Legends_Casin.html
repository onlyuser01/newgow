<p>Overall, in the last four years, Hard Rock has contributed with monetary donations to more than 450 charities.

<p>“Philanthropy is in our soul and in our DNA. It has been very important for our ownership to give back to the community.” Joe Lupo, president of Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City</p>
<p>During the celebration ceremony of the venue, its president, Joe Lupo, revealed that philanthropy is an inseparable part of the company. Moreover, he explained that contributing to communities is incredibly important for Hard Rock.</p>
<p>Besides monetary donations, since it opened its doors in 2018, Hard Rock has contributed with in-kind donations. The venue showed support for events organized by its partners and provided hundreds of in-kind donations that included concert tickets, hotel accommodation, as well as dining and spa experiences.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Continues to Contribute to Good Causes</p>
<p>Hard Rock International (HRI) opened its first location back in 1971. Staying true to offering entertaining experiences, the company also supports philanthropic causes around the globe. HRI has donated millions to different causes such as hunger, drought, and disaster relief, cancer prevention as well as human trafficking.</p>
<p>Boosting its charitable efforts, HRI created the Hard Rock Heals Foundation in 2016. The company revealed that this internal brand segment is “committed to championing the message that music is power.” Seeking to fund health and wellness programs around the world, the Hard Rock Heals Foundation teams up with organizations that contribute to philanthropy through music.</p>
