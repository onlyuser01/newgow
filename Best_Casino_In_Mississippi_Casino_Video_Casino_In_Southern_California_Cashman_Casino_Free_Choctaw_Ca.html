    <h1>Best Casino In Mississippi Casino Video Casino In Southern California Cashman Casino Free Choctaw Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Lindsss,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding the relevant screenshots. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I can see that you have requested permanent self-exclusion but unfortunately, without stating any reason. Is that correct?</p>
<p>I have checked the general terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>„35. RESPONSIBLE GAMING/GAMBLING</p>
<p>35.1 For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which enables You to close Your Account or restrict Your ability to place bets or game on the Website for a minimum period of six months. Once Your Account has been self-excluded You will be unable to reactivate the Account under any circumstances until the expiry of the period chosen under this paragraph. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period You will be entitled to re-commence use of the Services by contacting support@biamo.bet."</p>
<p>I can confirm, from the forwarded screenshots, that your requests have been sent to the correct email address. However, please understand that applying self-exclusion takes some time (ideally no more than three days). Until you receive a confirmation from the casino that restrictions have been applied successfully, your account remains accessible and deposits are accepted. I agree immediate action would be excellent, sadly, it is not always possible. Could you please advise if you received any reply from the casino already?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
