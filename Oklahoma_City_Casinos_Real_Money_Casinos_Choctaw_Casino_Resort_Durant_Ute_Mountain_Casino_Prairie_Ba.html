<p>Cryptocurrency gaming platform Lucky Block is going ahead with a dedicated daily jackpot prize which will be introduced at some point in mid-May. The total prize pool available in the lottery will start at $2.40 million, the company explained.</p>
<p>The company has been gaining traction with players in some of the world’s biggest gaming markets, including the United Kingdom. In the UK, the company is teaming up with Dillian Whyte, the heavyweight boxer, who is an official brand ambassador for the company.</p>
<p>Lucky Block Encourages People to Join</p>
<p>Lucky Block is offering all sorts of prizes for its upcoming jackpot draws, including cryptocurrencies and tickets to sporting events. Anyone who holds tokens on the platform may buy tickets for as little as $5. Free entries are also part of the offer and will be awarded to people who connect their crypto wallet with the account.</p>
<p>The free entries are what make the product available in jurisdictions that are a little more demanding from gaming platforms. According to Lucky Block CEO Scott Ryder the new prize draw will completely shake up how lottery-style games are run and proceeds will go to charities and players. Ryder continued:</p>
<p>“Also, now with a free entry option, the jackpot draws will attract users to our wider gaming platform in droves. We look forward to the challenge of catering to these new crypto users and scaling up as we grow our other giveaway and play-to-earn games offerings.” Lucky Block CEO Scott Ryder</p>
<p>Simple Onboarding Process to Enjoy</p>
<p>Lucky Block offers a number of excellent features that makes it possible for the platform to onboard people seamlessly. Unless of going in too heavily on cryptocurrencies, Lucky Block has also chosen to enable FIAT options as a more welcoming option to new players.</p>
<p>Overall, Ryder is confident that Lucky Block it as a significant advantage when compared to other products on the market. The website further offers Platinum Rollers Club NFTs, which are part of the assets available on the platform as part of its governing structure.</p>
<p>Winners of daily draws will also have to pick from charities and good cause initiatives which will receive a part of the amounts won by consumers.</p>
