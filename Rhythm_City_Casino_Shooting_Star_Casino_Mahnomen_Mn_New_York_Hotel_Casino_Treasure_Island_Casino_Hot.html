    <h1>Rhythm City Casino Shooting Star Casino Mahnomen Mn New York Hotel Casino Treasure Island Casino Hot</h1>

<p>DraftKings, the company that gained popularity mainly for its leadership role in the daily fantasy sports, has launched mobile sports book operations in Iowa.</p>
<p>Wild Rose Casinos Provide The Stage</p>
<p>Back in October 2019, as part of their partnership deal with Wild Rose Entertainment LLC, Boston-based DraftKings launched brick-and-mortar sports betting operations in the three Wild Rose Casino &amp; Resorts, in Jefferson, Clinton, and Emmetsburg, owned and operated by the LLC, and now these operations expand into the mobile betting realm.</p>
<p>The state legislation in Iowa requires each customer 21 or above that is willing to place bets through an app to initially register in-person in one of the state casinos, with the three Wild Roses properties becoming the 11th, 12th and 13th in the state that provide the convenience for clients to place wagers on sports through their phones.</p>
<p>Mobile App Provides Convenience</p>
<p>Powering mobile sports book operations is an important step for every operator in the growing sports betting market in Iowa, but DraftKings is not the first to do that, with William Hill sports book in the Prairie Meadows casino in Altoona and Gaming Innovation Group /GiG/ launching a mobile solution for the Hard Rock Sioux City casino being among them.</p>
<p>But being first does not matter that much as every client should be enticed to come to the casino, at least once, until 2021 when that requirement would not be valid any longer, and DraftKings believe being the best would be what it takes to establish a leading role in the state market.</p>
<p>“We believe DraftKings is offering the best mobile app yet to Iowa sports betting enthusiasts. Since we opened the sports books, we have been deluged with requests for this app”, Tom Timmons, President and COO, Wild Rose.</p>
<p>Incentives To Attract Bettors</p>
<p>DraftKings’ sports book, as much as any other operator’s one, provides the breadth and depth for the bettors, but what makes it stand above competition are the incentives and in-game options, with more than 100 prop bets available, including individual yardage totals, quarter-by-quarter scores, point spreads, the nature of the first points and many others.</p>
<p>Enticing customers would not be that hard for DraftKings, as the company is offering a bonus of up to $1,000 for new clients, comprised of a first deposit bonus and a first matched bet, both of up to $500, with the deposit bonus cleared at a rate of $1 for each $25 wagered.</p>
<p>The daily fantasy operator has also options for the more casual player, with bets as low as $0.10, just to use wagering as a way of engaging more fans for the game.</p>
