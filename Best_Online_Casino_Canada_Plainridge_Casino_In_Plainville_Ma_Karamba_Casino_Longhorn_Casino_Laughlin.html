<p>The BETguard remote gaming server and content will be premiered at BetRivers and PlaySugarhouse, the announcement says</p>
<p>ODDSworks partnered with Rush Street Interactive to launch BETguard in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>ODDSworks is a leader in the remote gaming server (RGS) technology segment in the North American market. The partnership with Rush Street Interactive (RSI) marks a new step in the deployment of the BETguard platform and further establishes its foothold in the market. The rollout will begin at RSI’s BetRivers Android and iOS apps and website.</p>
<p>The company expressed its excitement for the extended partnership with RSI, praising the operator:</p>
<p>RSI is not only a great business partner but a great company. Larry DeMar, president, ODDSworks</p>
<p>This was accompanied by a warm welcome from RSI chief executive officer Richard Schwartz.</p>
<p>The principals of ODDSworks are industry veterans who I have known and respected for decades. Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>DeMar also hinted that the step into Pennsylvania could soon be followed by expanding into another state. “We look forward to working with RSI to build our respective operations in that state, and other markets, as our close relationship grows in the years to come,” said DeMar. The press release detailed plans for expansion into New Jersey.</p>
<p>However, the new agreement marks ODDworks’ continued foothold in the state. iGaming hosting provider Internet Viking signed a Pennsylvania-facing deal with ODDworks recently, expanding its own presence in the state as well. The deal enables ODDworks to take advantage of Internet Vikings’ specialized cloud hosting services, fueling content in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Market is Blooming</p>
<p>The Keystone State is a natural focal point for industry participants thanks to the nature of the market there. Gambling has been very successful in the state, and in multiple forms, and even though it has been regarded as a relatively isolated market, it has also been widely recognized as a rather successful one at the same time.</p>
<p>The 2022 financial results for Pennsylvania show that legalized gaming was up 11% in comparison to the prior period. The combined revenue figures included iGaming, sports wagering, table games, slot machines, video gaming terminals (VGTs), and fantasy contests, and were provided by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). The total combined revenue amounted to $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the state is ready to rest on its laurels, though. Although it was largely speculated that Pennsylvania won’t be joining MSIGA any time soon, that was almost a year ago. Also, the state has been looking into ways to legalize esports betting, which would open up an entirely new niche for development and give birth to a new market.</p>
<p>It’s obvious how the state is a prime target for industry participants, then, and why ODDSworks’ focus on strengthening ties with operators in the state is a valuable strategy. This has been recognized by others, of course, with High 5 Games also partnering with RSI to gain a foothold in the state, for example. Bet365 also set foot in Pennsylvania recently.</p>
