<p>This week, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board reported that gross gaming revenue (GGR) from the state’s 13 riverboats and two brick-and-mortar casinos totaled approximately $174.5 million. The revenue includes gaming wins from slot machines, table games, and sports betting.</p>
<p>October’s win represented a 2.5% year-over-year decline from October 2022. It marked the ninth consecutive month where gaming revenue declined from the same month in the previous year.</p>
<p>The Lake Charles market and its three riverboat casinos, Golden Nugget, L’Auberge, and Horseshoe, led the way in October with a GGR of roughly $63.4 million. That represented a decline of 4.2% from October 2022.</p>
<p>The boats in the Shreveport/Bossier market — Boomtown, Bally’s, Horseshoe, Sam’s Town, and Margaritaville — combined to win $44.8 million. Shreveport/Bossier was one of the bright spots last month, as that win represented a year-over-year GGR increase of 3.6%.</p>
<p>Market Report</p>
<p>The New Orleans market, consisting of Harrah’s New Orleans, one of the state’s brick-and-mortar casinos, and Boomtown and Treasure Chest, won $39.9 million. That’s a 12.2% year-over-year drop. Harrah’s accounted for most of the market wins at $19.6 million, representing a 5.1% decline from October 2022.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge gaming win totaled $20.6 million, a 13% surge. The recent opening of the reimagined Queen of Baton Rouge, which is now a land-based casino following an $85 million investment, fueled the market growth. The Queen’s revenue spiked 51% to about $6.4 million. The L’Auberge accounted for most of the remaining Baton Rouge GGR at $13.4 million, as the Belle won only about $800K.</p>
<p>Slots at the state’s four racetracks, Delta Downs, Louisiana Downs, Evangeline Downs, and the Fair Grounds, combined to win roughly $22.3 million. That’s a 13% loss from October 2022, when the tracks generated nearly $25.7 million in slot win.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers kept about $3.25 million of the $32.8 million in retail bets they took, a 28% year-over-year drop. Online sportsbooks fared better, keeping $39.2 million of the $276.2 million in bets wagered. That represented a 14% increase in mobile sports betting from October 2022.</p>
<p>Possible Reason for Ongoing Declines</p>
<p>Gaming is flourishing across most of the US. The American Gaming Association reported this week that commercial gaming revenue in the third quarter topped $16.1 billion. The industry is on pace to report its third consecutive year of record gaming revenue.</p>
<p>So, why is Louisiana’s gaming industry struggling? Matt Roob, senior vice president of analysis for Spectrum Gaming Group, a Pennsylvania-based gaming consultancy, believes video poker, which isn’t counted in the LGCB monthly gaming tally, continues to find favor with gamblers.</p>
<p>Video poker machines operate inside bars, restaurants, hotels, off-track betting parlors, and truck stops. There are 1,390 video gaming locations across the state, with 11,834 terminals as of October.</p>
<p>Video poker revenue has increased from $623.8 million in 2019 to $839.2 million in 2021.</p>
<p>“People may be shifting their play and staying closer to home,” Roob told The Advocate in May 2022.</p>
<p>The machines, however, also experienced a bit of a rollback in 2022, as the gaming win fell to about $810 million.</p>
