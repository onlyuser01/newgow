    <h1>Casino In Shreveport Ethereum Casino Morongo Casino California Harrah S Philadelphia Casino Playland</h1>

<p>Hi Nicholas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post, We are sorry to hear your having difficulties with your withdrawal request. Firstly we would like to reassure you that we are always happy to see our players win, and the vast majority of our players have no issues when it comes to withdrawing with us.</p>
<p>As mobile telephone deposits are made on your behalf by the network provider, we do need to ensure these deposits have been cleared before we can move forward with processing any withdrawals. This does, unfortunately, mean that we are not able to process your win until we have received this information.</p>
<p>When you registered your account you confirmed your acceptance of our terms and conditions. We would refer you extracts from the terms and conditions which apply to your circumstances as follows:</p>
<p>Section 8: Withdrawals</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to void bets and refuse or withhold a withdrawal where we have any reasonable grounds for closing your Account (see Section 9 below), including where there is evidence of "suspicious activity" (see Section 12 below). In particular, if we suspect fraud or fraudulent activity on your part, or any of your deposits are charged back to us as a result of (alleged) fraudulent use, or loss, of your credit or debit card, we reserve the right to refuse or withhold a withdrawal from your Account and, if necessary, to lawfully collect any payments owed by you. It is your responsibility to provide correct bank details for winning payments. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you to obtain correct bank details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may ask you to provide other information, such as proof of payment of a phone bill, before we make a withdrawal payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We aim to process withdrawals for depositing customers within 3-4 working days (being Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays) of a request. Withdrawals for non-depositing customers will take 10-12 working days. Where we require source of funds, proof of payment of phone bill or any other documentation, withdrawals will be delayed pending receipt of such documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we are unaware of your billing cycle, this may mean you may have to wait until the next bill has been generated. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. Rest assured your withdrawals will remain in your account until the requested identification has been received.</p>
<p>We can see you have sent through screenshots relating to your phone bill, unfortunately, we are unable to accept them as they do not show the information required.</p>
<p>Contrary to your view about our reluctance to pay out, we are happy for our players to be successful and, once our security procedures have been satisfied, we are pleased to be able to make payments.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your identification and moving forward with processing your winning payment.</p>
<p>However, this query has already been raised on "ask gamblers" (https://www.askgamblers.com/casino-complaints/mfortune-casino-withdrawal-withheld-with-absurd-reasons) and is still on going.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion for both parties we would like to keep all communication on this issue on the original ask gamblers complaint thread.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>mFortune</p>
