<p>Wizard Games has released Cup Glory, a 5x4 slot with a women’s sports theme just in time for the upcoming soccer tournament for women</p>
<p>NeoGames’ subsidiary which offers top cross-platform games and focuses on providing data-driven i-Gaming entertainment, Wizard Games, has announced the launch of its freshest slot, Cup Glory. The women’s soccer-themed game from the studio that scooped up the Rising Star in Casino award during the SBC Awards for Latin America is packing mouth-watering features.</p>
<p>Ranging from the unique Shooting Wilds that adds more suspense to the gameplay and the Free Spins round that incorporates multipliers and sticky symbols, the new slot’s features once again prove the provider’s skill in mixing “time-tested recipes with innovative ideas.”</p>
<p>The game, which is available in 24 languages for Windows, iOS, and Android players, was launched right before the upcoming soccer tournament for women as well as the launch of Wizard Games’ freshest slot, Captains of the Coast.</p>
<p>The new all-women soccer slot follows the release of other top titles from the same studio, including Unchain the Dragons, Alice in Vegasland, and Majestic North.</p>

<p>Take Home the Trophy!</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art graphics, audio, and visual effects create an electric atmosphere on the pitch. The crowd is going wild and the team is warming up, so this makes it the perfect time for you to join the action on the 40 paylines and get ready for what could be one of the most exciting and rewarding soccer matches in history.</p>
<p>Any random spin could trigger the Shooting Wilds (golden footballs) with multipliers of up to x5 that can result in higher wins provided they belong to the same winning payline, in which case they are combined.</p>
<p>Landing at least three scatter symbols will not only mean scoring a goal, but it will also attract up to 12 Free Spins with Sticky Wilds. Any Shooting Wilds that are seen landing during the spins round become sticky. Whenever they are seen landing on top of one another during subsequent spins, their multipliers are combined for an even nicer boost.</p>
<p>Players can also opt for the Buy Free Spins option to instantly trigger the Free Spins round in exchange for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh game, managing director Benedict McDonagh expressed their thrill for being able to present the “big game” to players looking for engaging mechanics and attractive features prone to create a buzz.</p>
<p>The studio’s portfolio, which currently hosts more than 140 games, also covers table games, scratchcard options, bingo, keno, and instant win alternatives, including the February-released Magic Baccarat with side bets.</p>
