    <h1>Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Best Casino In Mississippi Florida Casinos Commerce Casino Photos Wend</h1>

<p>On 19/7 I informed slot10 via email that I wanted to block and close my account. I received an answer the same day and they tried to get me to stay and offered a bonus. I got up but they insisted that they had a good bonus offer even though I wanted to close and block the account "the account still not blocked the evening 19/7".</p>
<p>20/7 the account was still not blocked and I was able to log in. They insisted me to stay and offered nice bonuses once again.. so I wrote an email again that I wanted the account to be blocked and excluded asap !. 21/7 Was the account still not blocked. 22/7 I wrote another email that I wanted the account blocked and excluded but nothing happens. yesterday the 30/8 I wrote again that I want my account blocked and excluded "nothing happens" .. Today 31/8 my account was still open until i wrote a "claim deposits back email" this is against anything that has to do with safe gambling. I want to claim all my deposits back after 19 / 7-20 due to not taking this serious and professionaly.. That I have been able to make deposits even though I demanded that the account be closed is completely crazy. I want slot10 to look at this case and do the right thing and pay back my deposits as it would actually be technically impossible to make deposits and play hysterically even though I demanded that the account be closed permanently from 19/7 . I hope they will find a solution as this is completely unacceptable and contrary to responsible gambling. this is completely unfair and not okey to not closing account when it is requested by me.</p>
