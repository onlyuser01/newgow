<p>Reevo continues to expand its aggregation platform with a string of prominent supplier partnerships designed to boost its footprint and reach</p>
<p>The aggregator has now teamed up with Booming Games, a studio known for a string of exciting games that will be readily available to the aggregation platform, and its partners. Some of the games include Gold Gold Gold, Go Bananza, and King Cobra.</p>
<p>Reevo Welcomes Tons of New Content from Booming Games</p>
<p>The studio has developed more than 100 slot games and holds licenses from Spelinspektionen, the Malta Gaming Authority and UK Gambling Commission. Reevo too is certified and able to operate across a number of jurisdictions, which makes the integration with Booming Games a great opportunity for both companies which will step forward and bring more quality content to partner operators.</p>
<p>Reevo also stands out by virtue of its fast onboarding process which means that Booming Games will be able to roll out its games with new operators in the fastest fashion possible. All is done through a single API integration and through a streamlined process that works flawlessly for operators and players.</p>
<p>Reevo head of sales Petra Maria Poola has welcomed the arrival of Booming Games and said that the company was excited to add its games to what is rapidly shaping up to be one of the leading iGaming aggregation platforms. She also pointed out some of the evident benefits of teaming up with Booming Games:</p>
<p>Booming Games slots are great to look at, great fun to play and appeal to a multitude of players so we’re pleased they’ve joined our aggregation offering, providing them with fantastic distribution and our customers with access to their compelling premium content. Reevo head of sales Petra Maria Poola</p>
<p>Confident in the Opportunities Provided by Aggregation</p>
<p>Booming Games CCO Frederik Niehusen was similarly pleased with the opportunity to work closely with Reevo, and also hailed the platform as a leading aggregation solution. The collaboration would make it possible for both companies to showcase their products to wider audiences, and let players access innovative games.</p>
<p>“Together, we are confident that we can deliver a premium gaming experience to players and drive significant growth for both companies. We look forward to a successful and prosperous partnership with REEVO,” Niehusen said.</p>
