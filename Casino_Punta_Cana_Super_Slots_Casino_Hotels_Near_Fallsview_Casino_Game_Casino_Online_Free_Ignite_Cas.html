<p>WynnBet has teamed up with the Memphis Grizzlies as part of the sports betting operator’s launch in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Grizzlies and WynnBet Boost Brand Awareness</p>
<p>WynnBet has detailed its partnership with the Memphis Grizzles as the sports franchise and sports betting operator are coming together for a multi-year collaboration. As part of the tie-up, WynnBet will tap into the Grizzlies’ intellectual property and use it to spearhead social media campaigns as well as web and mobile applications. WynnBet has officially launched in Tennessee following approval by the Tennessee Education Lottery.</p>
<p>Whenever an event is held at the FedExForum, the Grizzlies home court, WynnBet will be there, the official press release explained. WynnBet and the Grizzlies will appear together in some of the most popular broadcast programs spearhead by the sports franchise and Grind City Media (GCM), which is an on-demand media platform and a digital content studio working with the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>WynnBet’s footprint will grow as the company will be an official presenting partner at the Chris Vernon Show hosted by the company and focusing on sports and entertainment. Wynn will also step in as the official presenting partner for Odds Couple, another sports show with a clearer focus on college football, basketball, and the NFL, including a detailed analysis of fixtures, lines, and odds.</p>
<p>Odds Couple is hosted by the likes of Rob Fischer and Lang Whitaker, along with Jon Roser and CJ Hurt. WynnBet will also join the GCM Podcast Network as an official advertising partner and appear on all GCM Podcasts’ productions. The company stands to benefit big from its partnership with the Grizzlies, which is a surprisingly well-represented team in the digital space.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue to develop through the Memphis Grizzlies Mobile App, which brings a comprehensive experience, such as news, features, merchandise, tickets, and more, and as a result of the alliance, it will now add a free-to-play game feature on top of everything else.</p>
<p>Free Games and Physical Locations at FedExForum</p>
<p>There will be the special Buzzer Beater Picks free game available directly in the app and presented by WynnBet. The game will essentially allow fans to try and predict various outcomes during official Grizzlies games, and for each successful prediction, fans will be climbing higher up the leaderboard.</p>
<p>To make sure it’s known to Grizzlies supporters, WynnBet will also receive the naming rights on the Plaza Level at the FedExForum. As a result, there will be a sports bar lounge along with other amenities that complement the sports betting experience and allow sports fans to settle in and place their wagers.</p>
<p>The WynnBet mobile app will also be accessible to fans, and more details are forthcoming. Memphis Grizzlies president Jason Wexler welcomed the opportunity for the team to be partnering up with WynnBet and said:</p>
<p>“The popularity of sports gaming in Tennessee continues to increase, and we’re thrilled to partner with one of the most recognizable names in sports and entertainment with WynnBet.”</p>
<p>Wexler was pleased to see WynnBet team up with the Grind City Media shows as well, pointing out the opportunity to bring various assets from the media, betting, and entertainment sectors together and even create new experiences for sports fans on-site at the FedExForum. Special Grizzlies-tailored promotions are now available at WynnBet in Tennessee.</p>
<p>In April, WynnBet pursued another deal with Minute Media which granted the sports betting operator access to various sports personalities and athletes.</p>
