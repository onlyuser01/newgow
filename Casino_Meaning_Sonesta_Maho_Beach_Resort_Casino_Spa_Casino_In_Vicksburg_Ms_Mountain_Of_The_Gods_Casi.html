<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s expansion into South Africa is a new opportunity for the company to popularize its games</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has unveiled a new partnership agreement with Hollywoodbets, a South African betting and gaming operator. Under the deal, the supplier will inject proprietary content into the operator’s platform.</p>
<p>This deal will mark Light &amp; Wonder’s foray into the country, expanding its overall global footprint. The entry was made possible by the Mpumalanga Economic Regulator (MER) and Western Cape Gambling and Racing Board (WCGRB), which cleared Light &amp; Wonder for launch in South Africa.</p>
<p>In addition to proprietary content, Light &amp; Wonder will also power Hollywoodbets with aggregated games from third-party studios, such as ReelPlay, Big Time Gaming, Blueprint, Greentube, Gaming Realms, Inspired, Elk Studios, Relax, G Games and Fantasma. These games will appear on Hollywoodbets’ platform at a later date, according to the official announcement.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s expansion into South Africa is a new opportunity for the company to popularize its games. The supplier’s live casino content already enjoys a lot of success in the country, making it very optimistic about the launch of its iGaming titles in the region.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s titles are also consistently among the top performers on gaming floors across South Africa. Players will now get to experience these very games online, boosting their engagement. This move aligns with the company’s omni-channel strategy and ambition to deliver fresh casino experiences.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets Seeks to Provide Players with Premium Experiences</p>
<p>James Bustin, Light &amp; Wonder’s commercial director, commented on the matter, saying that South Africa’s regulated online market presents a lot of opportunities to his team. He explained that the foray into the country allows the provider to fulfill its promise to “bring new worlds of play” to consumers all over the world.</p>
<p>We are excited to have launched our online games that we know South Africans already love playing in land-based casinos, and now we look forward to launching even more content from our partner studios in the coming months. James Bustin, commercial director, Light &amp; Wonder</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wayde Dorkin, Hollywoodbets’ head of product, also commented on the matter, saying that the new content deal will allow the company to provide players with “the best possible casino experience.” Dorkin said that the partnership means that his team will now have expanded access to many highly compelling games.</p>
<p>The initial range of games produced by Light &amp; Wonder is very impressive and this is only the first step. By integrating Light &amp; Wonder’s platform, we are looking forward to adding other third-party studios to our audience. Wayde Dorkin, head of product, Hollywoodbets</p>
<p>In the meantime, Light &amp; Wonder just selected Oliver Chow as its new chief financial officer. Chow had been serving as interim CFO for a while, replacing Connie James who departed from the company earlier this year.</p>
