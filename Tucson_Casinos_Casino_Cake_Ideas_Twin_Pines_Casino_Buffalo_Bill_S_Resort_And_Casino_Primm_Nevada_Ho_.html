    <h1>Tucson Casinos Casino Cake Ideas Twin Pines Casino Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino Primm Nevada Ho</h1>

<p>Dear Pawelle,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>„Multiple Accounts</p>
<p>47.Each Player is allowed to open only one Account per person, family, household, IP address and email address. Use of more than one Account per physical Player is known as "multi-accounting" and as such is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>48.In the event that We suspect that a Player is opening multiple accounts by using the same or similar names, address, telephones, email addresses, same or similar dynamic IP addresses, computer or other devices, with the intent of defrauding or cheating, We reserve the right to close an Account or Accounts at any time and to cancel all the transactions, bets, waive winnings and deduct bonuses from all relevant Accounts.</p>
<p>49.In the event that We suspect that a Player is acting as a part of the Player’s collusion undertaken with the intent of defrauding and cheating, meaning by using the same or similar names, address, telephones, email addresses, same or similar dynamic IP addresses, computer or other devices and acting on same or similar pattern, We reserve the right to block the relevant Account(s). Following the internal investigation We reserve the right to close an Account or Accounts at any time and to cancel all the transactions, bets, waive winnings and deduct bonuses from all relevant Accounts.</p>
<p>50.Condor Group reserves the right to block regular or tournament play and/or prize distribution should any evidence of multi-accounting or collusion arise."</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you and your girlfriend have been playing at this casino from the same IP address? Have you accumulated your winnings with or without an active bonus, please?</p>
<p>Please, forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru, or alternatively, post it here.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
