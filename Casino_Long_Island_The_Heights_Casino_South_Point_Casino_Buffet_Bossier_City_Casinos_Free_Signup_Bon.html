<p>Team USA Strong FIFA Women’s World Cup Favorite, Unlikely White House Visitors</p>

<p>The United States is the heavy favorite to win the FIFA Women’s World Cup, regardless of whether the team faces Sweden or the Netherlands in the finale on July 7 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais stadium in Decines-Charpieu, France.</p>

<p>The US women survived a tough test 2-1 against England on Tuesday to advance to the final. The team is a perfect 6-0 in the World Cup, and has outscored their opponents by a staggering 24-3.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has the US at 1/6 to win the Cup. That implies odds of 85.71 percent, with a $100 wager netting just $16.67 should the United States win on Sunday.</p>
<p>“I can’t even express how proud I am,” team USA coach Jill Ellis said after the match. “It was just such a great effort from everybody.”</p>
<p>“We had some challenges in terms of bodies and everything, and everybody just stepped up. And that’s what this team’s about. So just incredibly proud of them,” she concluded.</p>
<p>Netherlands plays Sweden today. The teams are respectively at 8/1 and 10/1 to win the World Cup.</p>
<p>Presidential Controversy</p>
<p>Megan Rapinoe, who caused controversy last week by saying she won’t be going to the White House should the team win the World Cup and be invited by President Donald Trump, was out of the England match with a hamstring strain.</p>
<p>Never one to shy away from a heated Twitter exchange, Trump responded, “Women’s soccer player @mPinoe just stated that she is ‘not going to the F…ing White House if we win.” The president continued, “We haven’t yet invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose.”</p>
<p>“Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team,” Trump declared. “Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!”</p>
<p>White House Odds</p>
<p>Irish bookmaker Paddy Power offered 5/1 odds that Trump would mention “Megan Rapinoe” in a tweet during the second half of the US vs. England game. The president refrained.</p>
<p>Trump paid $550 for McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King fast food when he welcomed the Clemson University national champion football team in January amid the federal government shutdown.</p>
<p>“If it’s American, I like it. It’s all American stuff,” Trump said at the time. “Three-hundred hamburgers, many, many french fries. All of our favorite foods.”</p>
<p>Online sportsbook Bovada has odds on whether Team USA will indeed take Trump up on his White House invite. The line is at Yes +400, No -700, meaning oddsmakers there don’t think there’s much chance the ladies make the trip to DC. Bettors who think they’ll decline would win just $14.29 for every $100 wagered on those odds.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is sending a relatively low-key representation to the World Cup final. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Karen Dunn Kelley is the highest profile delegate. In 2015, President Barack Obama sent VP Joe Biden and wife Jill to the final, which the US won. They also took Obama up on his White House invite.</p>
