<p>Red Rake Gaming, a provider of premium casino content, has inked a new partnership agreement with PokerStars Casino. Under the deal, the supplier will power its new ally’s platform with games. The arrangement comes almost three months since PokerStars also onboarded content from RubyPlay.</p>

A rich selection of cutting-edge titles will become available to players in multiple European regulated markets, such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Romania.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement covers Red Rake Gaming’s beloved Super Series slots, which are proven to resonate with players all over the world. The non-stop action such titles provide and their multiple innovative features and bonuses keep players engaged at all times.</p>
<p>In addition, PokerStars Casino will also get access to “1 million ways to win” games. The player-favorite genre continues to prove itself as a top performer, driving customer engagement and making significant profits for Red Rake Gaming.</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming Is Bullish on Popularizing Its Content</p>
<p>According to Red Rake Gaming, the agreement with PokerStars Casino is a testament to its commitment to delivering the best content possible to as many markets as possible. Furthermore, the deal highlights players’ positive reception of the provider’s games and their demand for more action-packed content.</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta’s managing director, released a statement on the partnership with PokerStars Casino, saying that his team is happy to supply the operator with games. He noted that the new partnership is in line with Red Rake’s desire to keep on popularizing its high-quality games.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with one of the largest and most prestigious operators in the industry and very much look forward to delivering our wide array of popular titles to PokerStars players. This collaboration reinforces Red Rake Gaming’s continued delivery of high-quality and engaging content across the industry. Nick Barr, MD, Red Rake Gaming Malta</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Red Rake Gaming also partnered with Starcasino.be, expanding its presence in Belgium.</p>
<p>The supplier, meanwhile, continues to work on its pipeline, constantly rolling out new games. Some of its most recent hits include games such as Buffalo on Fire, Ramses Legacy, Big Size Fishin’ and Boomerang Jack’s Lost Mines, among others.</p>
<p>Players in Spain, Romania, Italy and the UK will now be able to experience these titles thanks to the partnership with PokerStars Casino.</p>
