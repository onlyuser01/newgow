    <h1>Casino Website Spokane Tribe Casino Accident Casino In Lake Tahoe Sandia Hotel And Casino Live Casin</h1>

<p>I deposit 30 euro for a first time in that casino and i receive a 100% welcome bonus. I play slots and i saved my bonuses for the end(like a bonus hunt). When my balance was 0 they automatically cacelled my welcome bonus and all the winnigs from the bonuses i collected are gone(i played them but the balance not updated). They told me that because of the bonus was cancelled any winnings afterwards was gone.</p>
<p>I receive that as a response</p>
<p>"Your funds were charged off by the system, as you put off bets during the wagering period. And the system shows that first you completed the bet on the already lost bonus. The winnings from this bet were credited to the balance, and then it was charged off (since the winnings were on bonus money, and the bonus was already lost)."</p>
<p>Is that legal?</p>
