<p>Poker pro Alan Keating’s very first win on the Hustler Casino Live livestream included what Poker News is calling, “The biggest pot in US livestream poker history.” He scooped up $1.158M cash in heads-up action against the player known only as “Handz” during a session on Thursday night in Gardena, Calif.</p>

<p>Though Keating finished the session up more than $500K, he spent most of a post-victory interview criticizing his own play.</p>
<p>I think I’ve got to change how I start because I’m finding myself in these holes,” he told Hustler Casino Live. “It’s kind of fun getting your way out, but it’s a challenging way to play.”</p>
<p>Keating, known primarily for his World Series of Poker participation, doesn’t seem to enjoy the limelight much. He keeps a tight lid on the details of his personal life. About all that’s known about him is that he hails from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and is worth about $3 million.</p>
<p>The Record Hand</p>
<p>In a $200/$400/$800/$1,600 No-Limit Hold’em game, “Handz” raised to $9K on the button with ace-7 off-suit. He was called by Ben Lee in the small blind with 8-5 suited, then by Eric Persson with ace-jack off-suit, and Keating with king-2 suited.</p>
<p>The flop – the 10 and 6 of spades and the 5 of diamonds – was checked to Handz, who continued for $25K into a pot of $37.2K. Keating, one spade short of a king-high flush, was the only caller.</p>
<p>After Handz bet $70K on the 4 of diamonds turn, Keating check-called and the pair went heads-up with $227K in the pot. At this point, Keating had a 36% chance of winning to Handz’s 64%. The river gave Keating his flush with a 7 of spades.</p>
<p>Keating bet into Handz with $155K. Handz raised to $464K, forcing Keating all-in if he wanted to continue. Keating took two minutes to decide whether to make the call.</p>
<p>Keating said that after betting the river, he thought it would be interesting if Handz shoved.</p>
<p>“Then when he did, I was like, ‘OK well, maybe I should have thought that out further,’” he said.</p>
<p>A Hand for the Hand</p>
<p>Following the hand, fellow poker pros took to Twitter to commend Keating.</p>
<p>“@Mister_Keating legend,” tweeted Antonio Lievano. “Record pot on @HCLPokerShow! Congrats!”</p>
<p>Many poker players are now going to have second thoughts before making that naked ace-bluff shove,” added Andy Stacks.</p>
<p>Keating, though, turns out to be his own worst critic.</p>
<p>“It felt all right, I don’t know,” Keating told Hustler Casino Live. “I had the king-high flush. I’m not going to act like I thought of some brilliant thinking. I just called.”</p>
