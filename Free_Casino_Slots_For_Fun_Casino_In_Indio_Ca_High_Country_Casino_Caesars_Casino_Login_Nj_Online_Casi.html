<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>This "article" sounds more like someone else's opinion. If you want to understand the regulations, I'd go directly to the official source instead:</p>
<p>https://www.curacao-egaming.com/ceg-academy/#section-rules-and-regulations-on-aml</p>
<p>Allow me to quote from one of my recent posts regarding licenses:</p>
<p>I read some articles about how to acquire the Curacao gaming license recently - mostly advertisements, this one describing the advantages explains a lot, I'd say:</p>
<p>"Many online gambling operators have chosen to make Curacao their home because of the regionâ€™s fast and cost-effective licensing process.</p>
<p>Curacao is a stable country compared to Costa Rica, and unlike Malta and Cyprus, Curacao is outside of the EU, but still within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Curacao is also seen as an attractive destination for e-Gaming companies due to the simplicity of its gambling laws. Only one license is needed for any type of gambling operation, enabling registered companies to effectively run an online casino or sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Obtaining an e-Gaming license in Curacao is also significantly less expensive than in other parts of the world. When you combine this with the fact that Curacao is a modern, high-jurisdiction state with innovative IT infrastructure and an attractive tax system, this makes Curacao the perfect location for your e-Gaming company."</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a master license that allows companies to license all brands just under one license (this is the way I feel it works - can be complicated though), sometimes it makes players nervous, because the master license owner may actually be a different company that is stated as an owner in terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised players occasionally report being treated worst in licensed casinos. Sadly, some players see the Curacao licensed casino as much more dangerous places than the unlicensed ones.</p>
<p>To your question: If the official regulator fails to regulate, even the licensed casinos can do what they want. Normally, only the unlicensed ones are not bound by any regulations and are virtually untouchable.</p>
