    <h1>Social Casinos Real Money Casino Soundtrack Atlantis Hotel Casino Black Oak Casino Rv Park Ballys Ca</h1>

<p>Hi Kristina, thank you so much for getting back to me on this. I’ve been feeling helpless on this one and feel I’ve been just robbed. First of all one of the reasons they said they wouldn’t give me my money back was because it’s apparently in their policy that if you put cash into that casino you must gamble it and are not aloud to just take it back. This I find totally preposterous! I made a genuine mistake in that I was led to believe after a web search that they we’re top for poker which is obviously wrong information as they only cover casino poker and not the real poker from it’s truest form being the one I like to play. This is the email I sent requesting my money back.</p>
<p>Hi, I put my money into this site as I was lead to believe it was the best site to play poker on when looking on a search online. I tries to play texas holdem poker but couldn’t find any other than the one you play against a dealer. I asked the online chat and they confirmed the site doesn’t have such a game where you can play other online players so I tried to cash my money out. OK I made a genuine mistake and we’re not talking about a massive amount of cash here but with the current situation I’m out of work and was just trying to raise some cash. A bad way but I’m running out of money fast. I need my money back please. (GRAND IVY RESPONSE)</p>

<p>I have since tried to contact them but they have just ignored me and as I’ve been banned from the site I can’t go on and chat to the support team. I feel this site is corrupt and just stealing money. I have also seen on web forums that other people have been treated the same way.</p>
