    <h1>Casino In South Bend Casablanca Casino Mesquite Nevada Casino Near Yosemite Twinspires Casino The Or</h1>

<p>Supplier of gaming technology Scientific Games announced today it entered into an exclusive multi-year agreement with games developer Pixiu Gaming to distribute its titles via the OpenGaming ecosystem in North American regulated markets.</p>
<p>Pixiu Offers Diversification Away from Slots</p>
<p>The deal which makes Scientific Games’ content aggregation OpenGaming platform the exclusive distributor of Pixiu games, significantly enhances its offering and helps affirm its growing appeal among lottery operators in North America.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be extending our partnership with Scientific Games into the growing U.S. market. With a focus on high quality, intuitive games, often customised with our partners’ logos, Scientific Games is a natural partner for us and we look forward to launching more exciting titles through the year.” Tony Plaskow, Founder, Pixiu Gaming</p>
<p>Developer of bespoke games Pixiu is the creator of a number of player-favorite, market-leading Keno, Baccarat and Reactor games supplied to some of the major lottery clients such as Lotto Quebec, British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) and Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC).</p>
<p>“Our deal with Pixiu reflects the reach and power of the OGS. By continuously adding more quality content from a wide range of providers such as Pixiu, we’re generating strong momentum within the North American market.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Gaming, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>First Pixiu Game Set for New Jersey Launch</p>
<p>The OpenGaming content aggregator platform is set to launch with select partners for the market in New Jersey the first Pixiu game, Lucky Squeeze Baccarat, later this year, to attract players by unrivaled authentic casino experience, redefining interactive baccarat by offering them full control to squeeze the cards, besides the full ‘5 Roads’ scoreboard and an 8-deck shoe.</p>
<p>“We look forward to building on our long-standing relationship and working with Pixiu to bring new and unique mechanics to our partners throughout the U.S. With a focus on non-slots products, including powerful Keno, Baccarat, and Reactor titles, Pixiu gives operators the opportunity to reach new players and differentiate their portfolios away from slots.” Dylan Slaney, SVP Gaming, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Much like its lottery clients, Pixiu is committed to responsible gaming and supporting local communities and charitable causes, with Forget Me Not Children’s Hospice charity and Kamloops Food Bank being among the charities which already received donations from the games developer.</p>
<p>Customers at OpenGaming include some high-profile industry names such as Entain, which announced a new 3-year deal extension in March, as well as BetMGM after the sports betting brand and the tech supplier company agreed on a deal in October last year.</p>
<p>In April, Scientific Games signed a distribution agreement with Fantasma to add some of the developer’s exclusive slot game titles to the OpenGaming platform.</p>
<p>In October 2020, NetEnt agreed to have its iGaming content distributed via the aggregator platform, followed shortly after by slot developer Big Time Gaming.</p>
