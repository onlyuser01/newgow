<p>The recent senior-level appointment will be in effect as of September 1 and it comes at a time when the current chair, Marks Stewart, confirmed plans to step down</p>
<p>TAB NZ, the single racing sports betting agency in New Zealand, confirmed changes to its senior-level management earlier this week. The company revealed that Hon Kieran McAnulty, the Minister for Racing, appointed Anna Stove as the new interim chair of TAB NZ, replacing its current chair, Mark Stewart, who will be stepping down at the end of this month. The appointment of Stove as interim chair will be in effect as of September 1, 2023, TAB NZ reveals.</p>
<p>It was at the start of the 2021/2022 financial year that TAB NZ selected Stewart as its chair. The company acknowledged that he helped navigate it through a “transformative change” and highlighted the importance of the recent strategic collaboration with Entain.</p>
<p>Judging by the recently released statement, TAB NZ revealed that Bill Birnie, Wendie Harvey and Raewyn Lovett will retain their roles with the Board, joined by Stove. However, the company said that Jason Fleming has taken the decision to resign from his position with the Board to pursue another role with TAB NZ’s management team as general manager commercial.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, in June, TAB NZ launched its agreement with Entain. The strategic combination is already having a positive impact, fueled by Entain’s leading services and products.</p>
<p>Stove, Delighted to Spearhead TAB’s Growth</p>
<p>Despite the nature of the interim role, the new position with TAB NZ represents a promotion for Stove who has been holding the role of deputy chair since August 1, 2021. She thanked the outgoing chair and acknowledged his dedication and efforts. “I am very excited to be picking up the reins as we pay particular focus to working with the Government on modernizing New Zealand’s gambling settings,” said Stove.</p>
<p>“A legislative net which restores TAB NZ’s monopoly in the modern, online world will not only result in better harm minimization outcomes for Kiwi punters, but would also see an immediate funding uplift to racing and sport.“ Anna Stove, upcoming interim chair of TAB NZ</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Stewart added that he is proud of the legacy he helped create at TAB NZ while he was at the helm of the company. Speaking about the past, he acknowledged the success the company has seen in the last few years and spoke about the importance of the partnership with Entain.</p>
<p>Additionally, Stewart said that it is delightful to see Stove at the helm of TAB NZ as interim chair. “We have benefited from her governance experience in racing and commercial acumen over the last couple of years,” he added. Last but not least, he thanked TAB NZ’s management team for their ongoing support, hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>“We are indebted to Mark for generously giving his time to TAB NZ.“ Nick Roberts, CEO at TAB NZ</p>
<p>Nick Roberts, TAB NZ’s CEO, praised the efforts and dedication of Stewart, as well as the success his leadership brought. Finally, the CEO explained that under Stewart’s leadership, TAB NZ was able to reach tens of thousands of residents across the country and positively impact their lives.</p>
