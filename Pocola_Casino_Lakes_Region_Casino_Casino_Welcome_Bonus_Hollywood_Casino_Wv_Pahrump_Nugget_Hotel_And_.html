<p>The two-year agreement will see Novibet become the team’s primary sponsor, paving the way for future expansion in the country</p>
<p>Sportsbook sponsorships in Brazil face significantly less stigma than in other countries, as most Brasileirão teams have secured similar contracts. The agreement will benefit both parties, substantially bolster Fortaleza’s coffers and give the Greek bookmaker a significant visibility boost. Novibet is steadily pursuing its Latin America expansion goals and is prepared to invest a lot of funds into establishing solid brand recognition.</p>
<p>Fortaleza Is Now among the Best-Funded Brazilian Clubs</p>
<p>With the Novibet partnership now official, the number of Brasileirão clubs sponsored by betting sites rises to 19. Nearly all the country’s high-profile football teams have partnerships with operators, with Cuiabá as the sole exception after Luck.Bet did not renew their agreement. The extra funds are vital to the clubs’ competitiveness, and gambling sponsorships are substantially less divisive than in most other countries.</p>
<p>The sponsorship is the biggest in Fortaleza’s history and will place it among the best-funded teams in the country. Fortaleza president Marcelo Paz expressed his excitement regarding the deal. He noted that securing such a high-profile sponsor highlighted the club’s achievements and growing fanbase, promising to provide continued value to the team’s newest partner.</p>
<p>It is a sponsorship that will help us directly in our day-to-day activities… and we will do everything… to give the best possible return to the ones who invest in our shirt. Marcelo Paz, Fortaleza president</p>
<p>The team will receive R$ 20 million ($3,83 million) per season for the next two seasons. In exchange, Novibet’s logo will prominently feature on the club’s shirts, shorts, and sleeves. The Greek operator will also maintain a presence on Fortaleza’s digital channels and display promotional messages at Arena Castelão during the team’s Brazilian Championship games.</p>
<p>Novibet Prepares the Ground for Future Expansion</p>
<p>Partnering with a prominent Brazilian team is another step towards Novibet’s ambitions to expand its Latin American presence. The operator recently successfully launched online in Mexico, partnering with brick-and-mortar casino operator Big Bola. Novibet considers Brazil a valuable and underutilized market. Partnering with a well-loved football team will allow the company to bolster its public perception, easing future expansion efforts.</p>
<p>Novibet president Rodolfo Odoni confirmed Brazil’s position as a strategic market, lauding the nation’s rich sports history and world-renowned football reputation. He lauded Fortaleza as a historic and beloved team, expressing his eagerness to spearhead the operator’s first forays into the country and become a part of its rich sports culture.</p>
<p>Through this partnership… and the ones to come, we want to become one of the world’s main supporters of Brazilian football. Rodolfo Odoni, Novibet president</p>
<p>Despite Novibet’s eagerness, an official Brazilian launch may be challenging given the country’s current political climate. While the government has expressed a desire to update the country’s sports betting regulation, progress is slow. With offshore operators running mostly unchecked, Novibet may need to wait for the market to stabilize before moving in.</p>
