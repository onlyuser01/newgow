    <h1>Osage Casino Hotel Tulsa Casino Near Me Open Now Pechanga Resort Casino Temecula Ca Riversweeps 777</h1>

<p>I sent you this letter, which I sent to them. They said it was photoshop. When I started to demand that they return my money to me, because I made 10 thousand from these 14 thousand deposits, they sent me this letter</p>
<p>So you wrote me the wrong qualification in the cap. I passed verification. They also wrote me a letter that I passed it, access to the account is open. Gave me access. I went in, clicked on the output and again the block. When I wrote to them again why the block, they began to send letters that the withdrawal should be made to the card with which the deposit was made. In total, I did dep from three. But with one constantly. Those two happened once. I told them that I made a deposit from this card. They asked for her screen again, although I sent it to them on the 30th, the very first one. Well, I sent them back the screen map. And then they wrote me a letter stating that I violated these clauses 4.4 .... This card was opened with my maiden name, I recently got married, changed my passport, but did not send it to the bank for renewal. Because the card is virtual, I use it only in vibe. During the type of verification, I clarified to them that the card was for the girls' surnames, and that I re-verified on their website, because I registered using my old passport. They also have both my old passport and a new one in the download. I had absolutely all the documents on the website in my personal account. I even threw off my marriage certificate to them, they did not accept it. So, judge for yourself, they have a whole fraudulent scheme there.</p>
