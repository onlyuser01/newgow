    <h1>Casino Background Casinos In Usa Casino Bethlehem Pa Blitz Casino Sweeps Slots Casino Jackpocket Lot</h1>

<p>Jackpocket has just launched its Jackpocket Lottery App in Montana. From now on, Montanan players can use the app to purchase lottery tickets and play on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Jackpocket Goes Live in Montana</p>
<p>Jackpocket Lottery App is a third-party application that allows players to buy tickets for some of the most popular lottery games. By using the app, players can enter games such as Big Sky Bonus, Mega Millions, Lotto America, Powerball and many others.</p>
<p>Jackpocket users can not only buy tickets but also keep them on their phones as images and check their results. In addition, lucky players are able to claim winnings of up to $599 through the lottery app. Extremely lucky players who win more than that will have to redeem their prizes from the Montana Lottery instead.</p>
<p>Upon its launch in Montana, Jackpocket has ensured that all needed customer protection tools are available to players. Montanan lottery enthusiasts can opt to exclude themselves from buying tickets or set deposit and spend limits. Other safer gaming tools are also available on the Jackpocket Lottery App.</p>
<p>In addition, Jackpocket will celebrate its launch in the Big Sky Country with a special promotion for first-time players. New users can snag a free lottery ticket by using the code BIGSKY on the Jackpocket app.</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, the founder and chief executive officer of Jackpocket spoke about the launch in Montana. He named accessibility and convenience as two extremely important factors.</p>
<p>Accessibility and convenience are of the utmost importance right now, which is why weâ€™re looking forward to offering Montanans, both long-time lottery players and new players alike, a digital-forward way of streamlining their day. Peter Sullivan, CEO, Jackpocket</p>
<p>Sullivan also promised that Jackpot will do everything to prevent problem gambling and engage customers at the same time. He said Jackpocket is committed to safety and innovation and will put these principles at the forefront of online gaming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jackpocket has a reason to celebrate as Montana is the 12th state where it has launched its app. Jackpocket Lottery App is currently available to customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Washington DC.</p>
<p>On a separate note, Jackpocket recently demonstrated its commitment to sports and sports betting by partnering with the Colorado Rockies, a famous team from Major League Baseball.</p>
