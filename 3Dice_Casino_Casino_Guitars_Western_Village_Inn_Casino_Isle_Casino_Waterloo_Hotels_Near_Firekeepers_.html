<p>Poker content producer PokerGO and Betegy, a developer of real-time visualizations for sports data and poker stats, have agreed on an unprecedented data package deal.</p>
<p>The deal follows up on their recent collaboration at the Poker Masters tournament. Betegy provided real-time visualizations of data and statistics during the event, which accompanied all of the event’s games.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, PokerGO president Mori Eskandani welcomed Betegy’s expertise and argued that poker and sports share a lot of similarities. Both verticals stand to benefit a lot from each other’s unique insight into live coverage and poker can learn from the way sports companies cover live events.</p>
<p>“PokerGO’s partnership with Betegy allows PokerGO to deliver live data in a seamless fashion, merging our existing graphics packages with compelling information. We look forward to providing an enhanced experience for our global viewing audience,” Eskandani noted.</p>
<p>PokerGO is one of the most successful subscription-based platforms by Poker Central, and it aims to provide high-quality high-roller poker events. Some of the more recent partnerships of the platform include established names such as Caesars and CBS Sports.</p>

<p>This collaboration is part of Betegy’s continuous efforts to establish itself on the North American and international market by developing engaging real-time graphics. Betegy CEO Alex Kornilov commented on the deal: “PokerGO has quickly become one of the gaming industry’s most popular brands, and Betegy is honored to be able to work with PokerGO on this wonderful opportunity.”</p>
<p>This is yet another achievement for Kornilov, who is also the company’s founder. Over the years, the firm has established itself as a market leader, following many successful partnerships with reputable names such as Yahoo Sports, Sportsbet.io, ESPN, Tipico, and others.</p>
<p>In July, Betegy also won its first EGR B2B Award in the Innovation in Sports Betting Software category. The award ceremony was held in London and recognized companies that have provided an outstanding contribution to the sports betting and gaming industry. According to the jury, Betegy’s clients’ exceptional commercial success and reputable references helped them secure the prestigious award.</p>
<p>In December 2020, Betegy’s chief executive announced that the company is opening up “a new chapter” by acquiring a new member of its team – the supervisory board member Bill Pascrell and the financial support of JKR Investment Group.</p>
