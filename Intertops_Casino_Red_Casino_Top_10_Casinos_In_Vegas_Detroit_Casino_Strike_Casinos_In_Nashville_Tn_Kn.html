<p>Knight Hot Spotz review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Knight Hot Spotz is a medieval knight-themed game from Pragmatic Play. The slot is based around a brave knight and his loyal pig as they attempt to protect their kingdom and all of the gold that is in it.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The best thing about the Knight Hot Spotz slot is undoubtedly its design. The game looks brilliant, with Pragmatic Play opting for a really fun 3D animation style. The reels are placed in the middle of a far-away kingdom, with the titular Knight standing on the side of the reels decked in armour. To make things all the more charming, he has a little pig as his sidekick.</p>
<p>The background switches when you trigger the Knight Hot Spotz Free Spins round, with the slot moving inside a castle full of treasure. The whole thing has a really fun atmosphere and is definitely one of the game’s biggest attractions.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Knight Hot Spotz uses a conventional 5x4 game grid. The slot has 25 fixed paylines, with winning combinations being formed of three or more matching symbols starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Like all Pragmatic Play slots, the control panel is under the reels. Players can adjust the stake using the +/- buttons on either side of the spin button, with the autospin and turbo options also found there.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has kept stuck with tried and tested bonus features in the Knight Hot Spotz slot. The game has a Free Spins round which is triggered when players land six or more Scatter symbols. The number of symbols that trigger the round determines how many spins are given.</p>
<p>During the round, the positions where Scatters had landed are highlighted with a frame. Any time an additional Scatter lands, its position is highlighted. If a position is already highlighted and a Scatter lands, it is upgraded.</p>
<p>At the end of the round, the highlighted positions become Money symbols. These can be worth between x1 and x200. The symbols are then all added together and paid out.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Knight Hot Spotz slot has a good math model. It has an RTP of 96.50%, which puts it above the industry average. This is something we recommend monitoring in our slot strategy guide. The game has been given a 4.5/5 volatility rating by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The maximum win in the slot is a modest 2,000x the player’s stake, which, while not bad, is not as good as other Pragmatic Play slots.</p>
<p>The minimum you can bet in the game is $0.25, and the maximum is $125. This range will accommodate both higher rollers and those on more conservative budgets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Knight Hot Spotz looks great, but the gameplay fails to inspire. The bonus feature is okay, but the game feels as though it lacks any real bite. The highlighted positions bonus in the free spins adds a little bit of excitement, but there is very little else here that is going to grab a player’s attention.</p>
