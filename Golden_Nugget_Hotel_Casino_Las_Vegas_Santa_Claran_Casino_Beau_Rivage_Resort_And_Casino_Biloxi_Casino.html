<p>The leading provider of games for the online gambling industry, Videoslots, announced it completed a landmark achievement. The company revealed Thursday that it released its 10,000th title, reaffirming its position as a leading operator within the growing iGaming sector. Videoslots revealed that it has gone live with RAW iGamingâ€™s Raging Super2Ways, allowing it to expand its presence and reach new audiences in regions such as Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>It was back in January this year when Videoslots announced the launch of its 9000th title. Now, seven months later, the company continued to expand its portfolio of content with the addition of 1,000 more games. Besides growing its portfolio of games, Videoslots continues to sign deals with providers for the iGaming sector. By now, the company has a portfolio of more than 200 providers and that list is set to continue growing.</p>
<p>Tom Wood, RAW iGaming's CEO, shared the excitement of Videoslots' team in light of the recent milestone achievement. In a statement, he explained: "What an incredible achievement for Videoslots, reaching 10,000 games and to have our new patent pending SuperSymbols game, Raging Super2Ways, as the game is such an honor for a new start-up like RAW." Finally, Wood pointed out: "We thank Videoslots for its continuing partnership and hope their players enjoy the game as much as we had fun building it."</p>
<p>Ulle Skottling, Videoslots' Deputy CEO, was similarly delighted with the company's latest achievement. "To reach 10,000 slots is something we would have only dreamt about when setting off on our journey in 2011 but it is a testament to the hard work of everyone at Videoslots that we have got to this prestigious milestone," he said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Skottling outlined: "It is a real feather in our cap that the 10,000th title is from RAW iGaming, who have been a brilliant partner for us, and we look forward to more success with all of our suppliers moving forward."</p>
<p>Videoslots was established back in 2011 and since then, the company has been growing rapidly. Operating for more than a decade, the company signed many deals with some of the biggest online gambling developers, allowing it to boost its portfolio. After surpassing 10,000 titles, now, Videoslots plans to continue growing its offering by reaching 11,000 titles and more.</p>
