    <h1>Casino Washington Seattle Las Vegas Casino Map Best Online Casino Pa Free Bonus Casino Casino Royale</h1>

<p>So I have been playing at Ovitoons and other sites owned by Universalslots / Mirage Corporation N.V quite a while now. I have always deposited with bonus and always also lost the balance. I have lost approx. 500-800€ on their sites.</p>
<p>Now I finally made it through the wagering requirement and made a withdrawal request of 750 on 28.3.2021 . However to my surprise my winnings were confiscated by the casino. I got no information about this by email or anything. I had to find out my self by asking their live chat. Their live-chat told me that I have abused their bonuses and asked me to contact their manager or something.</p>
<p>I sent an email on 30.3.2021 to the given email address suppor­t@u­niv­ers­als­lot­s.net asking about this and what is going on but got no answer.</p>
<p>Their terms make it seem like they can at some point stop giving you bonuses if you have them too much, which really means that if you win too much with them. However they have always given them to me after my deposit, even thought the live-chat operator always checks my account before adding the bonus. So as I see it they will stop giving the bonuses out after a win like this. This has happened to me on other sites as well.</p>
<p>I understand that idea, but there is no reason to confiscate the winnings when a bonus is wagered fairly and by the terms. By their terms they should just not give out the bonuses if that is the case that you cannot get/use them.</p>
<p>I proposed two options for them in my email:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refund my winnings they confiscated</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
<li>Refund my deposits for the bonuses that I should not have gotten on the site Ovitoons and also on their other sites.</li>
</ol>
<p>So to conclude according to them I should only get the bonuses when I lose and when I win its ok just to take the winnings and refer to bonus abuse. I strongly believe they are breaking their own terms by giving bonuses to "blacklisted" users and so they can confiscate their winnings while keeping them depositing more.</p>
<p>Hope we can get this sorted!</p>
