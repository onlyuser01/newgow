<p>The boost was across all sectors including sports betting, online casinos, retail casinos, and slot machines</p>
<p>The latest financial results report from the Danish gambling regulator Spillemyndigheden highlighted that the overall gross gaming revenue (GGR) for the betting, online casino, slot machine, and physical casino sectors amounted to DKK 1.8 billion ($254.9 million) in Q4 2022, which represents a 4.5% increase compared to Q4 2021.</p>
<p>The report also noted that all four gaming areas saw growth in gross gaming revenue (GGR) during Q4 2022. This can be attributed to the fact that the gaming halls and physical casinos were not impacted by Covid-19 restrictions in this quarter, unlike Q4 2021.</p>
<p>Online casinos contributed the most to the overall increase with a boost of 6.5% year-on-year. This means that GGR increased from DKK 723 million ($104.6 million) in Q4 2021 to DKK 770 million ($111 million) in Q4 2022.</p>
<p>In second place came retail casinos, which experienced an increase in GGR of 5.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022 when compared to the same period last year. This corresponded to a rise of DKK 5 million ($722,995) to DKK 89 million ($12.9 million) in Q4 2022.</p>
<p>Sports betting was actually the sector that experienced the least growth in the last quarter of 2022 with only a 2.5% increase year-on-year. Still, the sector reported solid numbers with GGR of DKK 607 million ($87.8 million).</p>
<p>FY 2022 GGR Was Also on the Rise</p>
<p>As reported by Spillemyndigheden at the end of January, the combined GGR for sports betting, online casino, slot machines, and physical casino sectors in 2022 reached DKK 6.7 billion ($969 million), with year-over-year growth of 7.5%. However, considering the impact of Covid-19 restrictions, the real-term increase in GGR was only 0.2% from 2021 to 2022.</p>
<p>The online casino industry saw only a slight increase of 2.4%, bringing in DKK 2.88 billion ($420.4 million), while the sports betting sector experienced a decline of 4.1% with a total of DKK 2.32 billion ($338.7 million).</p>
<p>However, the retail sector flourished with remarkable gains of 59.1% and 47.5% respectively for land-based casinos and slot machines, yielding a total of DKK 349 million ($50.95 million) and DKK 1.15 billion ($168.5 million). This can also be attributed to the removal of COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>It is important to note that moving forward Spillemyndigheden will switch from quarterly to monthly reporting, starting with the figures for 2023, which are expected to be released in early March.</p>
