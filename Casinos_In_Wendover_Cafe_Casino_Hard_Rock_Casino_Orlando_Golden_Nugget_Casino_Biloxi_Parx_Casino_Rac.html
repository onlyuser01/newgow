    <h1>Casinos In Wendover Cafe Casino Hard Rock Casino Orlando Golden Nugget Casino Biloxi Parx Casino Rac</h1>

<p>Good evening</p>
<p>I am listing my problem</p>
<p>I created an account on ice and today before the identification process was completed (everything had been accepted and the selfie with the card that I sent was pending) I went to log in and it said that my account is blocked.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that my account had 3,000 (three thousand euros) in profits from the previous days.</p>
<p>I contacted the service in the chat and they told me that I violated the rules because I have two accounts in my name and they will do me the favor of unblocking me but they will keep the whole amount (3,000 euros).</p>
<p>I was honestly speechless. When I created the account, I was not notified that these details exist and I proceeded normally with the registration. I explain to them that I don't have another account, they tell me that I'm lying and then they tell me that from February 2023 there is a registration with my name, my date of birth and similar emails m<strong>*</strong>*@gmail.com</p>
<p>And I'm having fun. Actually, I used this email in the past and logically (because I honestly don't remember after so long) I would have started a registration but it was never completed. I asked if there was identification of this account and they said no, I asked if there was ever any movement or transaction on this account and they also said no but it doesn't matter I violated the terms and the casino management decided to block me and they offer to the favor of unblocking me while keeping the full amount (3,000 euros)</p>
<p>What to do I'm crazy is it possible?</p>
<p>How can I cheat the casino with a second account when it has never been identified or even used.</p>
<p>I didn't get a tip, I told them keep at least half it's unfair but nothing</p>
