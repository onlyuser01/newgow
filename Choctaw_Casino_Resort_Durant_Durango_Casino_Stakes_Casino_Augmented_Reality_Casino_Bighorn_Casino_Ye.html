<p>This casino runs on the Realtime Gaming (RTG) platform, which is known for a range of issues related to bonuses. Most importantly, you need to obey the bonus rules even after completing the wagering requirements. Until you withdraw your entire balance or your balance drops to zero, the bonus is still active. You can have only one bonus active at any time. If you break any of the rules (e.g. restricted games, max bet, etc.), you may lose all your funds, including pending withdrawals. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p>This casino operates without a license. As a result, the casino does not have to follow rules set by licensing authorities. Additionally, you will not be able to turn to any licensing authority if you run into issues.</p>
<p>This casino applies a withdrawal limit to winnings from progressive jackpots. We consider this unfair, as these wins are usually paid out by the game provider, so it does not make sense for the casino to restrict them by a withdrawal limit.</p>
<p>This casino deducts the entire balance (or a very large regular dormant account fee) from player accounts that have been inactive for a certain period of time (6 to 12 months).</p>
<p>Casinos with a Below average Safety Index usually have an unfavorable ratio of their number of visitors to relevant complaints submitted by players. It means that this casino has probably treated some players unfairly in the past.</p>
