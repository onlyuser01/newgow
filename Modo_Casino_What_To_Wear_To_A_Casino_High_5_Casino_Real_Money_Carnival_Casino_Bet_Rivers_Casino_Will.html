<p>William Hill listed the new features of the app in an X post</p>
<p>William Hill’s US arm has launched an enhanced version of its sportsbook app in Nevada following a short shutdown. The release of the new app comes a few weeks ahead of the new NFL season, ensuring that bettors will have the best possible experiences.</p>
<p>The new app launched earlier today, following a short maintenance period during which the William Hill app was unavailable to bettors in the Silver State. Players can now play as usual and try out some of the brand-new features.</p>
<p>The renewed app boasts a host of new tools that its previous version didn’t. This includes enhanced offerings, new betting products, such as same game parlays, as well as new payment and withdrawal methods.</p>
<p>William Hill customers can rest reassured that their accounts and funds are safe and transferred to the new platform.</p>
<p>What’s New on the Platform?</p>
<p>William Hill confirmed the launch of its new Nevada sportsbook on its US-facing X account, William Hill US. In its post, the operator listed the new changes players can expect to see. This includes the following:</p>
<p>24/7 app experience</p>
<p>Expanded events on wagering menus</p>
<p>Expanded in-play wagering menu</p>
<p>Expanded prop wagering menu</p>
<p>Same game parlays</p>
<p>Next Batter Up</p>
<p>Additional ways to fund/withdraw</p>
<p>The operator teased that more upgrades are on the way. In the comment section, it also noted that Football Teasers on the app will be a little different. A spokesperson told a customer that closer to the kickoff of the season, the app will have 10 and 14 point alternate lines allowing players to parlay or bet straight.</p>
<p>William Hill Wants to Provide a Better Experience to the Fans</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing the player experience, William Hill US’ new sportsbook may be a precaution, considering its sudden shutdown during last February’s Super Bowl. Back then, the operator’s platform went down amid the hottest event in American sports, causing disgruntlement among its customers. William Hill had to eventually apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, William Hill joined forces with Eric Cantona, featuring the French soccer legend in its latest promotional campaign. The operator said that the brand ambassador’s unique charisma made him perfect for the campaign.</p>
<p>In early July, William Hill published its FY 2022 report, highlighting the resilience of its business in spite of the recent regulatory trouble in the UK.</p>
