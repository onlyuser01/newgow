    <h1>Broken Bow Ok Choctaw Casino Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Mn Riverside Resort Hotel Casino The</h1>

<p>13 weeks ago my husband asked for his account to be excluded forever due to a gambling addiction (See screenshot). This should mean that under no circumstance does the casino have a right to uplift this exclusion even if the player asks.</p>
<p>6 weeks ago he asked for the exclusion to stop so he could access the account and they let him, no questions asked. (See screenshot)</p>
<p>Since then, he has deposited Â£1,566.6 which is all of his savings. The casino had a duty of care to not open this account again when he asked for permanent exclusion due to a gambling addiction, he has now suffered significant loss due to this negligence.</p>
<p>This was written by my wife (who is a solicitor) but I am making the claim as the account holder. I believe everything in statement to be true.</p>
<p>It is not allowing me to upload attachments of the conversations but please let me know if you need to see further evidence. I can send an email with this.</p>
