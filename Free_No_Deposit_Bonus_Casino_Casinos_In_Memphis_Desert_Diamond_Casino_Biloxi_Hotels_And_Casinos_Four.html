    <h1>Free No Deposit Bonus Casino Casinos In Memphis Desert Diamond Casino Biloxi Hotels And Casinos Four</h1>

<p>Genius Sports has extended an existing supplier agreement with WynnBET, which will now feature official NFL sportsbook data, content and fan engagement options. Genius Sports builds on its existing relationship with WynnBET, which already features various sports data and odds from important competitions, including English Premier League, Liga MX, Argentine and Colombian Soccer, the companies specify in a press release.</p>
<p>Boosting Its Data and Engagement Capacities</p>
<p>This is another big development for WynnBET in the past weeks, after the operator was listed as an NFL authorized sportsbook operator just ahead of the 2021 Season. WynnBET will tap Genius Sports for various NFL official play-by-play statistics and the leading Next Gen Stats (NGS) data and more sports betting feeds.</p>
<p>Genius Sports is doubly important to WynnBET, as it is also affiliated with the NFL following a data distribution deal between the two companies negotiated in April 2021. As a result, Genius has access to the league’s advertising inventory.</p>
<p>In turn, this will allow WynnBET to create tailored solutions that boost fan engagement and offer better solutions for pre-match and in-game betting solutions, as well as lead to long-term customer retention. Genius Sports will further assist the WynnBET team by running data-driven marketing campaigns and achieve deeper engagement and lower cost of acquisition across numerous media, including TV, video and social channels.</p>
<p>Facing the Challenges of a Competitive Market</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Genius Sports Mark Locke said, “In an increasingly competitive US sports betting landscape, sportsbooks need to be able to deliver immersive experiences that engage their customers at every step.”</p>
<p>WynnBET operates in seven states presently, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Tennessee and Virginia. Through Genius Sports’ partnership with WynnBET, the company will be able to optimize everything from data feeds to the real-time information users see displayed for some of the biggest leagues, including the NFL, Locke explained.</p>
<p>Genius Sports has signed a similar deal with Caesars just this week, marking the company’s commitment to delivering better engagement solutions for the leading US sports betting operators.</p>
