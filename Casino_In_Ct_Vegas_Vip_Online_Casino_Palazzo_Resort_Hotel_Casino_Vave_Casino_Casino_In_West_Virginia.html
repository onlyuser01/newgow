<p>In a letter, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling-Related Harm in the UK urged TV broadcasters to stop daytime gambling advertising.</p>
<p>APPG Urges TV Broadcasters to Stop Daytime Gambling Advertising</p>
<p>The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gambling-Related Harm (APPG) in the UK revealed that it wrote a letter to a number of TV channels. In its letter, the APPG called for an end of daytime gambling advertising on TV. According to the announcement, 52 experts along with 16 parliamentarians called for urgent action.</p>
<p>In the letter, addressed to multiple TV channels, including ITV and Channel 5, APPG said that it is deeply concerned regarding the sponsorships by gambling companies aired during daytime TV. Furthermore, APPG asked the TV broadcasters to “end these sponsorship arrangements without delay“.</p>
<p>The APPG said that by sponsoring programs, gambling companies seek to “glamorize gambling“. At the same time, gambling operators target women and young people and encourage them to gamble. An example that the APPG pointed out is the TV show Neighbors, which is sponsored by Gala Bingo, a brand belonging to Entain.</p>
<p>The APPG has written to a number of TV channels (@ITV @channel5_tv) asking them to consider suspending gambling advertising on daytime television.</p>

<p>More Children Are Likely to Get Exposed to Gambling Ads, Alerts APPG</p>
<p>In the letter sent by APPG, the group outlined that currently, there are more than half a million problem gamblers in the UK. Furthermore, APPG stressed that more than 55,000 children age 11-16 in England and Scotland are having some form of gambling disorder.</p>
<p>The group also acknowledged that during the national “Stay at Home” restrictions, more children are at risk of being exposed to gambling ads. Finally, the APPG said that it is very concerning that TV broadcasters are promoting gambling, considering that the group has seen “first-hand the harm and devastation that gambling can cause to people’s lives, families and communities“.</p>
