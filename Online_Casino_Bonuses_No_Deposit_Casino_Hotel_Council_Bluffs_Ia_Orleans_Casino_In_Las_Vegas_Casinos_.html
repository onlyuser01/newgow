    <h1>Online Casino Bonuses No Deposit Casino Hotel Council Bluffs Ia Orleans Casino In Las Vegas Casinos</h1>

<p>Okey so this is the case from beginning until now.</p>
<p>After i won and requested a withdrawl almost three months ago now it has only been a struggle fo me to get my account verified at kingdice.</p>
<p>Please read the email conversations between us so that you can see for yourself.</p>
<p>When i first uploaded my passport which also says on their casino (take a look at the print i sent earlier)</p>
<p>they did not accept it as a valid document for ID verification, very strange as they specifik type Passport as a requested document for verification.</p>
<p>I also uploaded a proof of residence .</p>
<p>I got an email where they want a document with stamp and signature, it took me weeks to get that specific document they requested from the govournment of Norway.</p>
<p>Then they asked for another type of ID instead of a passport which is written on their website as a valid document.</p>
<p>So it took me a few more weeks to apply for a physical drivers license as we in norway have digital ones.</p>
<p>I had to book a time go to the traffic department which is one hour drive from where i live to take photos and make a new license.</p>
<p>then i got an email saying that it is not valid either as a ID verification document, so far i have given them three diffrent types of govournment issued ID´´ documents and the specific ones with stamp and signature included.</p>
<p>Now here comes the emails i recieved yesterday i can also forward them to you if you wish.</p>
<p>IDENTITY VERIFICATION</p>
<p>Hi Ayouba,</p>
<p>We need another identity proof from you.</p>
<p>We've reviewed your uploaded documents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your identity couldn't be verified due to .</p>
<p>Please log back in and upload a different proof of identity.</p>
<p>Reupload Documents</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>King Dice</p>
<p>then later same day i recieved this:</p>
<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I hope you are well.</p>
<p>I have been speaking with our Verification team today, who have looked over the document you provided and they have advised this is not accepted as you have already sent this one through previously.</p>
<p>In order to fully verify your account, please can you send an original copy issued by the bank or another institution or alternatively you are able to send an electronic bank statement.</p>
<p>I understand completely your situation, but we are not able to continue to accept the same document you keep providing.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained this please let me know and I will reach out to our Verification team to ask if it is accepted.</p>
<p>I appreciate your time so far, but if you have any questions please let me know.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Natalie</p>
<p>King Dice Support</p>
<p>So you see it does not matter what documents i send they keep declining and asking for new ones.</p>
<p>It is clear what the agenda is here and it is to do everything to stall this withdrawl as they close down their business by the end of this month as they mentioned previously to me.</p>
<p>I will still give them what the request for and it is a electronic bankstatement but im pretty sure of the outome already.</p>
<p>It will get rejected and asked for another type of document.</p>
<p>I have never experience such difficault verification that asks for specific documents and when they are recieved they get declined and new ones are asked for.</p>
<p>I hope you guys can see the picture here at casino guru.</p>
<p>They are shutting down their business and will probaly not pay out my money i just checked and their website is gone also.</p>
<p>But i see that they still have casino that are related to them such as clubriches casino.</p>
