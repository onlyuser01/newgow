<p>EveryMatrix has received a conditional license from the Michigan Gaming Control Board to bring its CasinoEngine integration and productivity solution to the Great Lakes State. The company is now recognized as an official distributor of content in Michigan and will be able to roll out a rich library of gaming opportunities to local operators.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix President Americas Erik Nyman welcomed the opportunity and said that Michigan was an important step forward for the company in the North American market. He said:</p>
<p>"We are very pleased that EveryMatrix has been granted the license approval for iGaming and expect to go live shortly with our customers."</p>
<p>Presently, CasinoEngine boasts an impressive portfolio of titles and suppliers already, along with 12,500 games and 250 casino vendors. CasinoEngine makes for quick and easy integration with third parties because the solution is based on a modular technology that allows partners to only access the particular aspects of CasinoEngine they are interested in.</p>
<p>The license marks the latest expansion by the company in the regulated gaming market in the United States, with EveryMatrix previously obtaining licenses in West Virginia and New Jersey. Meanwhile, EveryMatrix has not wasted any breath and made sure that it collaborates with prominent operators in the country, including BetMGM.</p>
<p>The company has been building up its aggregation service, adding content from numerous studios and prominent stakeholders, including Stakelogic Live and 3 Oaks Gaming. In similar news, EveryMatrix secured a content partnership with 888 for the US iGaming market.</p>
<p>The company also received a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) in Canada. Overall, EveryMatrix has been committed to expanding its reach in the North American market. Elsewhere around the world, EveryMatrix has signed content partnerships with Veikkaus, the Finnish state-owned gaming company, and the Maltese National Lottery.</p>
