<p>Gaming Innovation Group, a provider of cloud-based platform services to the iGaming industry, inked a deal with Grupo Boldt. As per the agreement, the supplier will power the Argentine operator with its acclaimed sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>GiG to Power Bplay with Sports Betting Solutions</p>
<p>The deal will see GiG support Grupo Boldt’s Bplay brand. The iGaming provider will provide the brand with its state-of-the-art sportsbook and account management solution. This agreement comes right in time for Bplay’s launch in Buenos Aires, the province housing Argentina’s capital of the same name.</p>
<p>Argentina’s gambling law follows a federal model where each local jurisdiction is responsible for regulating gambling. Therefore, operators must secure a separate approval for each province where they would like to launch. In that line of thought, the province of Buenos Aires is the fourth province where Bplay’s offerings will become available.</p>
<p>The operator is ambitious about growing its presence further and has plans of teaming up with GiG to launch in Entre Rios by the end of the year. GiG, on the other hand, now has the opportunity to further grow its footprint in the region. A few days ago, the supplier penned a Colombia-facing deal with Betsson, which is so far GiG’s third deal in the country. For reference, Betsson is one of GiG’s long-time partners.</p>
<p>The Supplier Is Keen on Expanding Its Presence</p>
<p>Jose del Pino, Grupo Boldt’s business unit manager, said that Bplay’s mission is to keep on bringing the best gaming experiences to its customers in Latin America. Speaking on the current deal with GiG, del Pino noted that the partnership is one of the fundamental pillars for delivering the Bplay experience. The manager said that he is looking forward to working with GiG and Sportnco Gaming, one of GiG’s subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Sportnco Gaming’s managing director, Hervé Schlosser, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He mentioned that these are exciting times to be a part of LATAM’s quickly growing iGaming market. Schlosser concluded that GiG’s partnership with Grupo Boldt will allow his company to grow its LATAM influence.</p>
<p>Our partnership with Grupo Boldt and the Bplay brand promises a great deal of potential, leveraging our combined knowledge and expertise to further consolidate our commerciality in the region. Hervé Schlosser, managing director, Sportnco Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gaming Innovation Group recently inked another deal with the Portuguese sports betting and casino operator Caravel Entertainment. That deal demonstrates that GiG is bullish on expanding in multiple regions at the same time and growing its brand.</p>
