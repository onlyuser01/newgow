<p>Supplier of gambling technology, software, and equipment International Game Technology (IGT) announced that its cashless gaming solution and modules have been deployed at six Station Casinos’ properties in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>At the Forefront of On-Premise Cashless Payments</p>
<p>The deployment of IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGTPay cashless gaming modules of the IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system via the STN Cash app across six flagship casinos under the Station Casinos brand is set to make Las Vegas the epicenter of the cashless gaming revolution.</p>
<p>Nick Khin, chief operating officer of Global Gaming at IGT, was excited “to see Station Casinos at the forefront of the on-premise cashless gaming revolution,” following the decision to power its STN Cash app with IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGTPay modules of the IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system.</p>
<p>“In deploying IGT’s turnkey cashless solution and providing more ease to its customers, Station Casinos is positioned at the forefront of on-premise industry payment trends,” Khin concluded.</p>
<p>The multi-year, enterprise-wide agreement between IGT and Station Casinos will see the tech supplier deliver its user-friendly, intuitive, and play-driving cashless gaming solution aimed at land-based gaming establishments.</p>
<p>Distinguish from Competitor Casinos</p>
<p>Tom Mikulich, senior vice president of Innovation at Station Casinos, hailed the casino brand as “the leader in guest experience,” offering its guests to benefit from “leading-edge technologies such as IGT’s Resort Wallet and IGTPay” and their experience-elevating impact on slot play that will help Station Casinos distinguish from its competitors and reward its loyal Boarding Pass members.</p>
<p>“Our IGT-powered STN Cash app is deployed across our entire Nevada enterprise and has introduced efficiencies and player conveniences that support Station Casinos’ growth and profitability targets,” Mikulich added.</p>
<p>The Resort Wallet module generates a protected cashless wagering account for casino patrons while the IGTPay module serves as the payment gateway that will enable Boarding Pass members of Station Casinos to transfer funds from debit and credit cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets. Both modules will be integrated into the STN Cash app that facilitates the funding of slot play from a personal mobile phone.</p>
<p>Once transferred to the cashless wagering account, funds can be easily loaded into a slot machine as credits during play and as soon as the play is over, returned to the cashless wagering account and then be either cashed out or kept for the next gaming session.</p>
<p>The Resort Wallet and IGTPay modules that were named “Product Innovation of the Year” in the 2021 Global Gaming Awards Las Vegas will also eliminate the need for a physical Boarding Pass card during slot play as loyalty points for patrons are being accumulated or redeemed simply by tapping in with their smartphones.</p>
