    <h1>Casino Near Me Now Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Resort Casino Ocean Casino In Atlantic City Casino</h1>

<p>In October, Australian casino giant Crown Resorts named David Tsai as the new chief executive officer of its property in Burswood, Crown Perth. Yesterday, Tsai officially stepped into the office and released a statement on his plans for the casino.</p>
<p>Tsai Steps into the Office</p>
<p>Tsai was formally welcomed to the company with a traditional smoking ceremony on Crown Perth’s Great Lawn. The ceremony was led by Dr Richard Walley OAM, a Noongar man and leading Aboriginal performer.</p>
<p>As CEO of the property, Tsai will be responsible for Crown Perth’s remediation action plan. He will be tasked with working alongside Paul Steel who was appointed as an independent monitor as the two of them implement the Perth Casino Royal Commission’s recommendations.</p>
<p>Crown’s remediation plan comes in the wake of a wave of hurdles for the company. The casino operator was deemed unsuitable to hold casino licenses in Barangaroo and Victoria after various failings were uncovered. However, the company is hellbent on working on its shortcomings and fixing its business. The appointment of Tsai as CEO of Crown Perth attests to the company’s ambitions.</p>
<p>Tsai is a former MGM Resorts executive who worked with the international gambling juggernaut for a decade and a half. As a result, has plenty of executive experience and will leverage this expertise to help Crown Perth fix its past mistakes.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts Welcomed the New CEO</p>
<p>Ciarán Carruthers, Crown Resorts’ chief executive, welcomed Tsai as the CEO of the company’s Perth property. He praised the new appointee for his experience and passion for “instigating true cultural change.” Carruthers also said that he is sure that Tsai would be capable of reforming the casino. Crown Resorts’ CEO added that he is looking forward to working with Tsai and the Perth team on creating high-quality experiences for the company’s customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, David Tsai used the opportunity to talk about his plans. He said that he is happy to start a journey at Crown Perth and added that he is happy to join the Australian company. Tsai praised Crown Perth for being a world-class venue with best-in-class restaurants, accommodation and entertainment facilities and said that he will do his best to implement the remediation plan.</p>
<p>I am deeply committed to delivering on our reform and remediation plan and cultural transformation, and ensuring Crown achieves its ambition of becoming a world leader in the delivery of safe and responsible gaming and entertainment. David Tsai, CEO, Crown Perth</p>
<p>As CEO of the property, Tsai will head more than 6,000 employees and will have to work with them on improving the company’s inner culture.</p>
