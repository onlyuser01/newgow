<p>Entain, one of the world’s leading gambling brands, has confirmed that it is planning to phase out its sponsorships of sports. This means that Entain’s brands in the country, including Neds and Ladbrokes, will stop marketing their logos on the shirt of sports teams. This comes as a part of a broader push in the country to limit the exposure of gambling advertisement.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald recently reported that 62% of voters want to see sports gambling and commercials removed from the sports. The opposition to gambling ads in sports is much greater than the general opposition to coal, oil, and gas companies, for example – only 27%.</p>
<p>Entain spoke to the publication and said that it is time for the company to phase out advertisement and align with a more responsible overall policy. Entain is expected to stop appearing on the shirts of athletes as it seeks to reduce its sponsorship of sports and is addressing crucial events around the world.</p>
<p>A similar debate is brewing at home in the United Kingdom where Premier League football clubs are debating whether they should cut ties with gambling firms, or at least make sure that any partnership does not feature the display of said firms logos on athlete shirts, social media channels and physical properties.</p>
<p>Entain has built many great partnerships in the country, the media said in a report. The company has offered support to both the NRL and AFL, and a number of clubs in the competitions, including the Brisbane Lions and Brisbane Broncos. Entain also supports organizations such as the A-League and the UFC.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes has already been folding existing partnerships in Australia as well, having parted ways with the Broncos in July. The $7.5m partnership was phased out in Queensland after the local government hiked the point of consumption tax, which was welcomed by Tabcorp at the time and said that this 5% increase in the levy will actually empower the local gambling giants to be competitive.</p>
<p>Gambling advertisement is often a controversial topic that continues to haunt regulators, consumers, responsible gambling groups, and others. Entain making a first determined step in this space is an important benchmark though as it clearly demonstrates that if there is a will, there is a way. Even AFL teams in Australia are calling for a ban on gambling advertisement and many have opted in voluntarily, way ahead of the Premier League in fact.</p>
