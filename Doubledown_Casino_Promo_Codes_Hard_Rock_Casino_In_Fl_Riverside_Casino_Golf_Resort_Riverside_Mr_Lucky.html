<p>The Young Gamers and Gamblers Trust (YGAM) has begun the search for a new CEO after its founder and incumbent Lee Willows announced he is to leave the charity at the end of October.</p>
<p>Willows founded the charity, which aims to prevent young people from suffering gambling harms, in 2014 alongside Anne and Keith Evans. All three have lived experience of gambling-related harms and under Willows’ tenure, the charity became an established leader in the fight against problem gambling.</p>
<p>Along with exceeding its first-year targets for its joint Young People’s Gambling Prevention national programme, the charity also signed significant education partnerships with English Premier League football clubs Burnley FC and Leeds United, under Willows’ stewardship.</p>
<p>Willows said: "It has been a privilege to lead this amazing charity for seven incredible years. With the endless support and dedication of my co-founders Anne and Keith Evans, I have been on an extraordinary personal journey, and I feel extremely proud of what we and the staff team have achieved together."</p>
<p>"In 2014, I was determined to use my experiences of gambling harm to create a positive force for good and focus our efforts on evidence-led education and prevention. We have since developed a portfolio of award-winning programmes that are now helping to safeguard young people in every region of England, Wales and Northern Ireland."</p>
<p>"As YGAM is entering its third strategic cycle, the timing is right for me to step down. This is a special charity and one that has exciting plans for the future. I will always passionately support the exceptional staff team and I look forward to seeing what they can achieve next."</p>
<p>The charity announced that Helen Martin has been appointed as Chief Operating Officer and will take on the CEO responsibilities until a replacement for Willows has been found, with further details on the recruitment process to be made in the near future.</p>
