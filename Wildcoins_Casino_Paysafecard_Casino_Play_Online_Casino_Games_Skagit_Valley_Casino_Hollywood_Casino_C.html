<p>Yes, I passed the kYC verification, I rejected all the bonuses as I normally do so that there would be no obstacles when withdrawing, the explanation from the Weiss casino support, regarding the rejected withdrawals, was that I should have opted for the IBAN withdrawal method, This method was not available at the time of withdrawal and there was only one option available "bankcard", having contacted support around 4/5 times until they provided me with a solution, I posted this and resolved the withdrawal rejection situation , the withdrawal was made available, and I then received 3 payments in the amount of 478 usdt in approximately 3 days, since then I have not received any more payments, and the explanation given by support is that it can take from 15 minutes to several days, leaving a bit subjective since several days can be 5 days, 15 days, 200 days, etc... a bit of a vague answer, having then told me that the maximum period allowed will be 10 working days according to the terms and conditions of the website, even it has not exceeded 10 working days, it will not be long before this deadline is not met, and if the payments are as they have been until now and it takes an infinity of time, it will certainly exceed it, my question is, given that the payment has been processed, and having received around 1400 usdt, if it was processed they could at least make 1 transaction each day, and not 3/4/5 days apart, because tomorrow will be the fourth day without having received any more transactions.</p>
