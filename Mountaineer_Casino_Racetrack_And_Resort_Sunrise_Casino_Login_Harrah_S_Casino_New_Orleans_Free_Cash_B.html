<p>It’s time for the final round of the Premier League and Manchester City has a chance to win the title. Pep Guardiola’s men are already at the top of the table, but Liverpool is breathing just behind with only one point fewer. That said, to win the title, Manchester City needs to beat Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>

<p>Manchester City to Win Its Eight Title</p>
<p>Manchester City is currently in the shared #5 position in the list of the clubs with most title wins in the English top-flight. The Sky Blues have won the title seven times – two times in the 20th century and five times since the Saudi takeover.</p>
<p>The last time they won it was in 2021, meaning that they’re the defending champs. Online sportsbooks believe they are going to defend the title, giving the odds of just -714.</p>
<p>For that to happen, they need to win in the EPL final round. So, can they do it? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Not only do they have the most expensive roster of all the Premier League teams, but they also have the motivation to win. On top of that, they will also have fans to cheer them on. At home, the Sky Blues are 14-2-2 in the Premier League this season.</p>
<p>One final reason why Manchester City is expected to win with no problems on the Premier League final day is that these guys have a fantastic record against Aston Villa. They won nine of their previous 10 duels in all competitions and are without a home win to the Villans in 15 years.</p>
<p>Can Aston Villa Cause a Sensation?</p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, Aston Villa would finish the season in the #10 position. For that, however, they’d need a win over Manchester City, as well as to see several other teams lose on Sunday.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario, however, doesn’t exist for this team. Even if they get obliterated by Manchester City, they will not drop in the Premier League rankings – no one can overtake the #14 position from them.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Aston Villa Prediction</p>
<p>If Pep Guardiola’s men don’t win on Sunday, it would be the biggest failure of this team in years. The Sky Blues just cannot let that happen. We think this and so do online sportsbooks, as evident from the fact that they’re giving just -555 on this team winning.</p>
<p>You might not find the odds too attractive, but you can always spice things up. Betting on the handicap (a.k.a. spread) is a way more lucrative option. We think Manchester City will win big. After all, they destroyed each of their previous three EPL opponents by four or more goals.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City -3 (+250)</p>
