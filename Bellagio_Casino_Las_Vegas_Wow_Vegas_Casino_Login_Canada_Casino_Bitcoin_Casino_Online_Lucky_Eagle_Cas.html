<p>The addition of in-play betting products from Simplebet is expected to help Hard Rock Sportbook attract new customers</p>
<p>Micro-betting products expert Simplebet announced today that it has struck another major US sports betting partnership by adding Hard Rock Digital to its roster of business partners.</p>
<p>Expand US Product Reach</p>
<p>The new agreement with Hard Rock Digital will see Simplebet roll out its portfolio of micro-betting products live on the Hard Rock Sportsbook platform across multiple states, expanding the operator’s offering and lure to customers.</p>
<p>“Hard Rock Sportsbook is committed to building the best product in the market, and we know our players will enjoy the addition of play-by-play bets on football, basketball, and baseball to our already robust selection of in-play offerings,” commented Hard Rock Digital’s president, Matt Primeaux.</p>
<p>Under the arrangement, Simplebet will deploy its short-form betting markets for the NBA, MLB, NFL, College Football, and College Basketball via Hard Rock Sportsbook, further expanding its presence in the US and North America.</p>
<p>“Hard Rock is a global brand that needs no introduction, and we’re delighted to partner with them and offer an immersive digital betting experience like no other,” said Simplebet’s chief executive officer, Chris Bevilacqua, confident that what Simplebet has to offer will enhance Hard Rock Sportsbook’s in-play offering.</p>
<p>‘Entertainment for Any Type of Online Player’</p>
<p>Primeaux further outlined that what Simplebet offers in terms of micro-betting products is “perfect for sports fans that do not have time for a full game and casino players that enjoy the thrill of quick-resolution games like slots, roulette, and blackjack, convinced that the integration of these products “can provide entertainment for any type of online player,” as well as attract new players to Hard Rock Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Simplebet’s in-play markets gained in popularity during the NFL playoffs earlier in the year, and their addition to Hard Rock Sportsbook now, during the height of the NBA conference finals and as the season in the MLB begins to heat up, promises new and exciting opportunities for bettors and players with the operator to engage with the action.</p>
<p>With a suite of innovative products tailored to the NFL, NBA, MLB, college football, and college basketball, Simplebet enables sports betting operators, media and technology companies to elevate live sports broadcasts by offering their customers engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Digital is the latest addition to Simplebet’s roster of gaming partners, following hot on the heels of Amelco after the operator’s US subsidiary turned to the provider’s proprietary micro-betting products and technology in April.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Caesars Sportbook became the third major US operator to partner with Simplebet and enrich its offering with micro-betting products. DraftKings and bet365 are the other two operators to have signed deals with Simplebet previously.</p>
