<p>Gaming Innovation Group has delivered a statement of intent by selecting Andrew Cochrane as the new chief business officer for Platform &amp; Sportsbook</p>
<p>The 2012-founded leading iGaming technology company that supplies products, services, and solutions to iGaming operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), has announced the appointment of ex-DraftKings and SBTech executive Andrew Cochrane as its new chief business officer for Platform &amp; Sportsbook.</p>
<p>The move, which will see the new CBO work together with Platform &amp; Sportsbook’ recently appointed chief executive officer Richard Carter for a second time, represents an important milestone in the tech supplier’s plans for growth. Cochrane took it to his social media to announce his excitement about the appointment.</p>
<p>Cochrane, a “Prominent and Highly Respected” Industry Figure</p>
<p>Described as a “prominent and highly respected figure within the industry” by GiG, the new CBO is expected to bring his rich experience and proven track record of driving revenue growth and shareholder value to the table and help support the company’s success.</p>
<p>Further augmenting its choice, GiG mentioned the pivotal roles that Cochrane played in driving revenue growth for SBTech where he spent almost two years and occupied the chief commercial officer and chief business development officer positions.</p>
<p>GiG’s new CBO was also part of the executive team that led the DraftKings business combination which eventually resulted in the NASDAQ listing of the combined business in the spring of 2020.</p>
<p>The customer relations expert who engages with tier-1 and lottery operators also spent close to four years with DraftKings Inc. as senior vice president commercial.</p>
<p>There, he inked a series of strategic partnerships “with over $50-$100 million in annual partnerships” while busy guaranteeing the best-in-class commercial rates for services and products required by the company’s verticals including Sports Betting, Daily Fantasy Sports, and iGaming.</p>
<p>Cochrane was also Sporting Solutions’ key account director and sales director between July 2015 and July 2017. He was also Inspired Gaming Group’s global account director with the key responsibility of delivering the agreed service-level agreements and key performance indicators of the contract with the company’s largest leveraged buyout customer, William Hill.</p>
<p>Speaking about their previous collaborations, CEO Carter expressed his delight in having Cochrane “onboard to help propel our commercial efforts to unprecedented heights.”</p>
<p>What the New Position Brings</p>
<p>Together with Carter, the new CBO will focus on powering growth for the company’s innovative product suite via fresh agreements in growth global markets while strengthening its position as a leading option for turnkey solutions.</p>
<p>Cochrane will implement GiG’s commercial strategies across its iGaming platform, as well as across its sportsbook and Artificial Intelligence-based solutions. The list will include business development, partnerships, corporate development, and marketing.</p>
<p>His journey with GiG will begin with selecting and attracting some of the brightest industry pros who can help them unlock all the opportunities that await in GiG’s worldwide addressable markets.</p>
<p>At the start of October, GiG announced it would assist Goldenpark with making its entrance into Ontario’s online market. Earlier in the year, in May, the tech company extended its partnership with bet365.</p>
