    <h1>Wynn Casino Boston Casino Beach Pensacola Restaurants At Hollywood Casino Pechanga Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>Gaming suppliers and topflight soccer stars don’t usually have much in common, but Booming Games is determined to buck this trend</p>
<p>The acclaimed supplier has announced a landmark partnership with Ronaldinho, one of the most acclaimed soccer players of all time, who will now land his image and likeness to the studio and allow the company to build a series of innovative products geared towards the casino industry and soccer fans in particular.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho’s Image and Likeness Featured in a Series of Games</p>
<p>The resulting products will be built around the personality of Ronaldinho and use various assets associated with the player. The first of these games is set to arrive early into the new year, with no exact number of collaborations confirmed just yet.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Booming Games CCO Frederik Niehusen said that his company was excited to bring Ronaldinho’s image to the company’s games – a move that will revolutionize the landscape.</p>
<p>“It heightens the excitement for players and is crucial for our expansion not only in Latin America but globally. Ronaldinho is a global superstar,” Niehusen said.</p>
<p>The partnership is overseen by Robert de Assis Moreira, brother, and manager of the legendary player, who welcomed the opportunity to see his brother collaborate with Booming Games on this fresh opportunity.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Booming Games is an excellent choice. The company’s top-notch game development, worldwide distribution, and committed team make it an ideal collaboration,” Moreira explained.</p>
<p>Albeit a little odd to see a casino games supplier work with soccer players, many games have been successful precisely because they have been built around the brand and imagery of popular figures.</p>
<p>Booming Games Determined to Continue Expanding</p>
<p>Booming Games has been excited to seize new opportunities where available. The company has expanded its reach in Spain with 888casino at the beginning of the month, doubling down on the local sector and ensuring that it remains well-represented.</p>
<p>The company pursued a similar opportunity with Holland Casino Online in the Netherlands, with Booming Games sending a clear sign to the local market and ensuring that it holds a robust position locally.</p>
<p>Both markets are also very big fans of soccer, meaning that the upcoming game releases featuring Ronaldinho as their central piece will appeal to local fans. Booming also recently drove its first forays in the regulated Danish market.</p>
