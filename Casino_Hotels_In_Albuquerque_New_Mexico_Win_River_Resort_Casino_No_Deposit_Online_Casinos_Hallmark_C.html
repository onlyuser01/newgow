    <h1>Casino Hotels In Albuquerque New Mexico Win River Resort Casino No Deposit Online Casinos Hallmark C</h1>

<p>The supplier is driving another foray in the highly-lucrative albeit changing local market with William Hill as its go-to option</p>
<p>Moving forward, William Hill players in Italy will have the opportunity to benefit from Play’n GO’s full range of award-winning games, which includes Book of Dead and various well-established franchises by the company, such as Reactoonz, Rise of Olympus and Tome of Madness, among some of the company’s most prominent options.</p>
<p>Bringing Acclaimed Slot Franchises to Players in Italy</p>
<p>This partnership follows up on the two companies’ ongoing alliance which has already seen the Book of Dead games introduced to fixed-odds betting terminals in the United Kingdom, bringing the popular online classic to the brick-and-mortar industry, and not the other way around in a surprising trend-bucking move.</p>
<p>Play’n GO and William Hill are both committed to expanding their local footprint despite regulatory headwinds that could see licensing fees in Italy go up by a significant margin, and competition in the market diminished.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, William Hill Italy Head of Commercial Valerio Micchio welcomed this fresh opportunity and said that the company was very excited to see Play’n GO’s titles, hailing the supplier as a natural partner, and author of some of the best online slots.</p>
<p>“Our already-existing relationship points towards further success here in Italy, and we’re pleased to welcome a company who are as equally committed as we are to providing a safe, exciting experience to players everywhere,” Micchio added.</p>
<p>Building the Best Online Casino Experience Possible</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly hailed by Play’n GO Sales Leader, LatAm and Southern Europe, Michele Stefanelli who said that the company was very pleased to team up with William Hill and provide Italian players with the best online casino experience possible. Stefanelli added:</p>
<p>We’re confident that William Hill’s Italian players will love the opportunity to engage with our content, and we look forward to many years of success together. Play’n GO Sales Leader, LatAm and Southern Europe, Michele Stefanelli</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been steadily adding to its list of titles, with more than 300 premium online slots to date, one of the latest of which was Mega Don Feeding Frenzy released earlier in December. Play’n GO also launched Dutch Flip in the Netherlands earlier this year.</p>
<p>More prominent releases by Play’n GO over the past months, continuing to build upon some of the supplier’s most original franchises, were Raging Rex 3 and Legacy of Dynasties. Play’n GO also recently scored 250 million played rounds in a single day, setting an eye-watering record.</p>
