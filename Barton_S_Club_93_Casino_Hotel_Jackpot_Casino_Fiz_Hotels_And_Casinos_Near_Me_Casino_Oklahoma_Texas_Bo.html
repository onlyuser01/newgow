<p>Spotlight Sports Group, a global leader in tech, media, and content, is pressing on the Asian market through a strategic deal with Sky City. The agreement will help the former company reinforce its foothold in the region.</p>
<p>Spotlight to Develop Platforms and Sites for Sky City</p>
<p>As per the deal, Spotlight Sports Group will use its cutting-edge turnkey tech to create and manage specialist platforms. The latter will be reinforced by the company’s proprietary data sets, artificial intelligence, and smart content modules and will be provided to Sky City to increase its appeal to digital audiences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the agreement with Spotlight Sports Group will allow Sky City to offer media platforms in multiple languages and thus broaden its audience and appeal to certain demographics.</p>
<p>The deal between Sky City and Spotlight Sports Group will come to power at the start of the second quarter of 2022. As the year progresses, the two parties also plan to release two new media websites with corresponding mobile applications for each of the two.</p>
<p>The first site will be dedicated to racing content, including both horseracing and greyhound racing. The second will focus on seven different sports and aim for a broader audience by sharing content in numerous languages.</p>
<p>Spotlight Is Well-Poised to Reach New Markets</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group is happy to expand its business and double down on its efforts to expand across numerous regions. The company’s chief commercial officer, Sam Houlding, spoke about his company’s unique position. He mentioned that Spotlight’s savvy with tech media and its suite of expert content in over 70 languages makes it a great match to any sports publisher. Houlding also spoke about the deal, adding that the Asia expansion means a lot to Spotlight:</p>
<p>“Strategically this is a significant B2B media partnership for us and broadens our global reach, with this agreement in Asia following our recent expansion to service Spanish speaking markets with our AS.com partnership and our continued growth in North America.’’ SSG chief commercial officer, Sam Houlding</p>
<p>Spotlight has been vigorously working to scale its business. A week ago, the company signed a deal with Star Sports, agreeing to power the latter’s offerings with Racing Post content. This content is to reach Star Sports’ 18 retail shops in the United Kingdom, greatly increasing Spotlight’s influence.</p>
<p>Last year, Spotlight expanded its leadership team by appointing the experienced Justin Geiger as its new vice president of sales.</p>
