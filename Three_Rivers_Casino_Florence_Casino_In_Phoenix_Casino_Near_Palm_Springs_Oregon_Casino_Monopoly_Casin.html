    <h1>Three Rivers Casino Florence Casino In Phoenix Casino Near Palm Springs Oregon Casino Monopoly Casin</h1>

<p>DraftKings is adding Konami Gaming, Inc. iGaming content to its portfolio with one of the leading online casino and sportsbook brands in the United States committing to making its presence in the vertical more felt.</p>
<p>Konami brings a whole lot of excellent games that will now be introduced to the DraftKings brand in New Jersey at first via integration through Pariplay’s Fusion platform. Fusion is a powerful aggregator that facilitates the integration of different suppliers into new operators.</p>
<p>This is precisely how DraftKings will have quick access to Konami’s online portfolio and land-based casino games and offer players everything they have come to expect from the brand. DraftKings and Pariplay are no strangers when it comes to iGaming content collaborations either.</p>
<p>The two companies have already rolled out content together in the Garden State with Wizard Games, one of Pariplay’s in-house studios. This is just one of the many moves Pariplay has made in the North American market in recent months designed to strengthen the company’s presence there and expand.</p>
<p>Pariplay VP North America Shivan Patel welcomed the opportunity to facilitate the partnership between DraftKings and Konami and help onboard the titles. Connecting both companies is a great opportunity for Patel as well.</p>
<p>"Konami’s heritage in the land-based sector plays very well with online players and with such a large audience to put its game in front of through DraftKings, the potential of this launch is huge," Patel wrapped up.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been indeed committed to growing in the North American market. The company teamed up with EQL Games to further strengthen its reach in the region. Similarly, Pariplay also grew with Ainsworth Interactive in Canada, strengthening its content portfolio and improving its reach in the long term.</p>
<p>DraftKings has not just been seeking out individual brands to strengthen its content portfolio. The company similarly teamed up with EveryMatrix to introduce the SlotMatrix portfolio and give the operator an ample selection of worthwhile studio and game choices to strengthen its content offering.</p>
<p>DraftKings also added games by other suppliers over the past months. Some of the operator’s most notable content alliances include one with Design Works Gaming and Bragg Gaming Group.</p>
