    <h1>Resorts Casino Hotel Atlantic City Casino Livingston Tx Jamul Casino Hotel Southpoint Bingo And Casi</h1>

<p>NOVOMATIC’s digital gaming and entertainment division, Greentube, has launched its gaming catalog in the Dutch and Belgian online casino markets with Carousel.be and 711.nl respectively. Players in both countries will have access to Greentube’s established portfolio of titles that will strike home with consumers and offer them engaging gameplay, great features, and good potential for payouts.</p>
<p>Greentube Goes Live with Games in Belgium and the Netherlands</p>
<p>The titles featured by the company in both casinos include Simply Wild, Diamond Link, Mighty Elephant, Sizzling Hot, Random Runner, and many other worthwhile titles. Both markets are of particular importance to Greentube, which is keen on continuing to deepen its presence in regulated European markets.</p>
<p>Thanks to these partnerships, the company can continue to deliver trend-setting content that leads to a bigger share in each respective market. Commenting on this opportunity, Greentube sales and key account manager for the Netherlands Andy Duschek said:</p>
<p>In the space of less than a year since the regulated market opened, we have seen that our games have produced very strong results in the Dutch market and our goal now is to build on that excellent start. Greentube sales and key account manager for the Netherlands Andy Duschek</p>
<p>He praised the fact that Carousel is a trusted operator in both the Netherlands and Belgium and as such, the partnership had a deeper significance to both participants. Growth in both markets is part of the long-term strategy for the company, Duschek confirmed.</p>
<p>Greentube Committed to Growing Portfolio</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carousel COO Gilles De Backer was equally pleased with the opportunity. He said that Carousel was committed to creating a safe and reliable online gaming environment for players to enjoy. To ensure that, the company is committed to keeping on adding content from only the best suppliers.</p>
<p>Greentube makes a perfect fit for player bases in both Belgium and the Netherlands, De Backer said. Greentube has a number of excellent games that it can offer to partners. The company is present in social casino gaming, AWP reloaded slots, video slots, table games, and social casino gaming.</p>
