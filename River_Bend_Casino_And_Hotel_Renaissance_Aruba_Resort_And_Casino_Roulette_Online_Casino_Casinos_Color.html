<p>Shelley Hannah was the obvious choice because of her wealth of experience in iGaming, Relax Gaming said</p>
<p>Relax Gaming, a leading iGaming content provider and aggregator, has strengthened its leadership team with the appointment of a new chief product officer. The one up to the task is Shelley Hannah, an industry heavyweight with years of experience in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>Hannah boasts over 10 years of specialization in iGaming products and 5 years focusing on iGaming aggregation. She will leverage this experience to help the company elevate its portfolio while maintaining its robust pipeline.</p>
<p>Prior to her appointment as CPO, Hannah served Relax Gaming as director of casino products, leading the growth of the Powered by Relax and Silver Bullet aggregation divisions. Her input was instrumental in differentiating the company from its competitors and in establishing the provider’s unparalleled speed-to-market.</p>
<p>According to Relax Gaming, Hannah was the obvious choice for the new position because of her proven experience.</p>

<p>Hannah shared her thoughts on her new appointment, saying that she feels honored to be named CPO of Relax Gaming. She praised the company for its incredible success over the past years and said that she is excited to be a part of its growth journey.</p>
<p>I believe any company is only as strong as its people, and I am incredibly lucky to work with such a passionate team who want to take Relax to new heights. Shelley Hannah, CPO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Hannah promised to do everything she can to further elevate the provider’s position as a leading name in iGaming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer, welcomed Shelley on board. He lauded the appointee’s “exceptional leadership qualities and comprehensive knowledge of the iGaming sector,” noting that all of this made her “the ideal candidate to shape and elevate” the company’s content library.</p>
<p>The promotion to Chief Product Officer is richly deserved as she has been a hugely influential figure in our success and I am sure that with her skill and knowledge, she will continue to be an important figure in Relax’s continued success. Simon Hammon, CEO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>As CPO, Hannah will be responsible for maintaining the qualities that have made Relax Gaming an award-winning iGaming leader. Last year, the provider secured a variety of accolades, including Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider at the 2022’s EGR B2B Awards, Casino/Slot Developer of the Year at the SBC Awards and Best Game Provider at the AskGamblers Awards in 2022.</p>
