    <h1>7Bit Casino 50 Free Spins Casino Hotels In Atlantic City Casinos In Atlantic City Sunscape Cura ao R</h1>

<p>Dear Jorms,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your negative experience.</p>
<p>At Vikingbet we take responsible gaming seriously and we have a varity of tools available in the profile section.</p>
<p>Even during the sign up process players are asked if they have self excluded from any gambling websites in the past 12 months. And if they have they will not be able to sign up.</p>
<p>We provide advice and guidance to our players that is readily available immediately at registration, and for further information on our website that is available at any time.</p>
<p>Players can set their own deposit limits, time out function, self exclude option etc.</p>
<p>After reviewing your case we see that you emailed our support team and asked to close you account which was done. However this request was not for a permanent closure.</p>
<p>After a few weeks you contacted our support again and asked to have your account reopened.</p>
<p>After a quick review of your account the support agent only saw a few small deposits and made the decision to reopen your account with reference to our terms &amp; conditions 14.5:</p>
<p>14.5 Where You have closed Your Account, we may in certain circumstances be able to re-open Your Account with the same account details as before if You request us to do so. In such circumstances, while Your Account will have the same account details as before, it will be subject to the Terms of Use which are in force at the date of any such re-opening and any prior entitlements (including, but without limitation, to bonuses or contingent winnings) will no longer be valid.</p>
<p>I can also confirm that your Vikingbet account is now permanently closed and it will not be reopened again.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Vikingbet Casino Team</p>
