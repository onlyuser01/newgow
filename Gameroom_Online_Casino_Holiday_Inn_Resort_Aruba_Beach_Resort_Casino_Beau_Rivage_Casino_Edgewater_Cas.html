<p>A new report reveals that the global gaming and entertainment industry giant, Flutter Entertainment, may be looking for a new executive chairman</p>
<p>Gary McGann is an expert in the growing betting and gaming industry with significant experience. He joined Flutter back in 2015 and has served as chairman of the company since.</p>
<p>Global Gaming Giant Reportedly in Search of New Chairman</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a new report released by Sky News revealed that the gambling industry giant may be looking for a successor for McGann. Reportedly, Flutter has approached candidates that may be suitable to succeed him as a chairman. Moreover, the company has reportedly joined forces with the leading executive leadership advisory firm, Russell Reynolds Associates, to help in the search for an expert to succeed McGann as chairman.</p>
<p>According to the latest report, McGann’s successor may be onboarded this year. Still, it remains unclear when and if the senior-level change will be completed. For the moment, Flutter hasn’t confirmed or rejected the possibility to replace its current chairman.</p>
<p>McGann has a Bachelor of Arts from UCD and holds a Masters degree in Management Science. He is an experienced corporate leader with a track record in implementing effective strategies that help businesses grow. Besides Flutter, he held the position of chairman of Paddy Power. During that time, he spearheaded the company’s combination with Betfair.</p>
<p>Outside of the gaming sector, McGann was a part of Smurfit Kappa Group (SKG), the leading global provider of paper-based packaging. Overall, he was a part of SKG for nearly two decades. McGann held the position of group chief executive officer of SKG until August 2015 when he retired.</p>
<p>His professional background includes leadership positions with Aer Lingus and Gilbeys of Ireland where he served as Group CEO and CEO respectively. McGann was also a president of the Irish Business and Employer’s Confederation.</p>
