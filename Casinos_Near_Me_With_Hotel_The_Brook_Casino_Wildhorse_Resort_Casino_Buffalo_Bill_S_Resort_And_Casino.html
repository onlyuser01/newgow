    <h1>Casinos Near Me With Hotel The Brook Casino Wildhorse Resort Casino Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>(Wrote a similar post on their trustpilot page, so some of this text becomes a bit copy paste - The message is still completely real, however)</p>
<p>My friend and I chose to put 500 kroner into Casino999 in total, and participate in their welcome bonus, which due to the bonus, got us up to double, which meant we had 1000 kroner in initial deposit.</p>
<p>We both knew about the "bonus hunt" concept, which we have seen a lot of on Twitch, among other things. and wanted to try it myself.</p>
<p>Therefore, we started with 2 kroner spins on various machines, and were relatively lucky to get the bonuses quickly. The result was that we probably had 14 bonuses that we needed to open when we had managed to play all 1000 kroner and the balance stood at 0.</p>
<p>We started the opening and it went pretty wild. We were incredibly lucky with the winnings, which after just 3-4 bonuses got us up to 2000 kroner plus. The mood was fine. With the remaining 10 bonuses, we ended up with 7000 in total, which is a considerable amount for non-rich people.</p>
<p>All in all, with a little extra gambling, we ended up with 5,000 kroner in total, which was also the amount we ended up wanting to withdraw.</p>
<p>They then request various documents, such as photo identity, proof of address, a picture of both sides of your credit card with which you paid, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, they get that.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, they ask for another payment of 100 kroner, so that they can confirm the credit card to which they have to send the money.</p>
<p>Later on the same day as we send the 100 kroner, we receive an email in which they write that due to "Cheat and rigged games" they have canceled the payment, kept the 5100 kroner, and permanently banned our account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool, what about the DKK 600 we put in????</li>
</ul>
<p>After threatening with a police report and the gaming authorities, we can now, as a sign of "goodwill" (casino999's words), get the 600 kroner we deposited back again. However, this means that we still lack our 4,500 NOK, which we had actually won, but yes... We will probably never get that money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can never recommend this casino. They make up their own excuses that aren't even in the rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can also see on their Trustpilot that many other Danes have had the same experience.. It is a mystery to me how such a casino can still be allowed to retain its Danish gambling license.</p>
