    <h1>Yellow Brick Road Casino Chittenango Best Casino In Las Vegas Casinos In Albuquerque Nm Sunray Casin</h1>

<p>Supplier of technology and data-driven solutions to the racing and wagering industry BetMakers Technology Group announced it first significant racetrack sponsorship in the US.</p>
<p>Australian-based supplier of technology for global horse racing operators BetMakers Technology Group has agreed with Kentucky Downs to support a number of races at the racetrack. As part of the sponsorship deal, the technology supplier’s Global Tote business which powers wagering at the racetrack will become the title sponsor of the $500,000 “Global Tote Juvenile Sprint.”</p>
<p>BetMakers acquired the Global Tote business as part of the acquisition deal for pari-mutual wagering technology supplier Sportech, first announced by the end of last year. The deal for all Sportech racing and digital assets and IPs in the US, UK, Europe and Asia propelled BetMakers into another trajectory for global growth.</p>
<p>The significant sponsorship agreement is the first for the Australian technology group in the US, having previously provided an additional $1 million under the 2020 “BetMakers Bonanza,” awarded to the connections of Authentic after winning top prizes at the 2020 Haskell Stakes, Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup Classic at Keeneland.</p>
<p>Speaking about the sponsorship agreement, BetMakers head of international operations Dallas Baker outlined the racetrack as “one of the most unique racing experiences” globally, expressing his content that BetMakers’ Global Tote division became the sponsor of a racetrack with such high regard.</p>
<p>The sponsorship deal with Kentucky Downs came hot on the heels of two other horse racing industry events the technology supplier sponsored last month, first being named the official fixed-odds partner of the 100th Saratoga Sale in Saratoga Springs and then joining the sponsors of the Racing and Gaming Conference at Saratoga.</p>
<p>For racing to grow and prosper in the US, reinvestment in the industry is vital. BetMakers is proud to be a sponsor of racing at Kentucky Downs and to support our industry through key initiatives such as BetMakers’ Bonanza and the National Handicapping Contest.” Dallas Baker, Head, International Operations, BetMakers Technology Group</p>
<p>Also in August, the Global Tote division completed the project related to the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) that delivered a new technology platform for the association’s National Handicapping Contest, showing its determination to continue to make significant investments in the racing industry in the US via new technology.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with all of our racetrack partners as we continue to enhance our presence in the US market,” concluded Baker.</p>
