<p>American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting operator DraftKings has launched its sportsbook offerings in Arizona, joining the other operators who are already capitalizing on the state’s freshly legalized sports betting market.</p>
<p>DraftKings Joins Arizona’s New Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>Arizona sports betting went live just a few days ago and saw several licensed operators launch just in time for the annual edition of the National Football League. The state’s adult sports fans can now get involved even more in their favorite team’s journey by wagering through the official regulated outlets. DraftKings is proud to be joining the ranks of these approved operators.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ president and co-founder, Matt Kalish, is excited to be one of the pioneers in the newly-debuted Arizona sports betting industry. The state is the fourteenth where DraftKings’ mobile sportsbook is operational and Kalish thinks that now is the perfect time to get local fans to know his company’s betting offerings.</p>
<p>Kalish thanked all parties who were responsible for greenlighting sports betting and by extension DraftKings Sportsbook in the state: the Arizona legislature, the Arizona Department of Gaming, Governor Doug Ducey, and his spokesman Jeff Weninger, Senator T.J. Shope, TOC Scottsdale, and the PGA Tour. “We look forward to becoming the sportsbook of choice for Arizonans across the state,” Kalish announced.</p>
<p>Arizona is already famous for its professional sports teams across various leagues and sports games. Although its launch was opposed by some parties, sports betting has a lot of fertile soil to grow and expand as a pastime to the local population. Arizona’s various athletes can provide sports betting opportunities to bettors of all preferences.</p>
<p>DraftKings: A Valuable Addition to the Fresh Sports Betting Ecosystem</p>
<p>DraftKings’ critically acclaimed services will be a nice addition for Arizona bettors. The Boston-based company propagates safe and responsible gambling and informed decisions. It offers services in 17 countries with its sports betting options available in 16 states (including states where DraftKings only offers land-based betting options). Outside of Arizona, DraftKings is taking sports bets in New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, Wyoming, New Jersey, Oregon, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>DraftKings is also popular with its fantasy games which span across 15 sports and are available in 7 countries. The fantasy games were launched in Arizona a few weeks prior to the sportsbook and are already enjoying a decent activity. Other than the sports bets, DraftKings will be hosting an earth-themed $500 free-to-play pool for Arizona players. The initiative has received the support of the Arbor Day Foundation and aims to raise awareness for environmental issues. As a part of the green activities, DraftKings will be planting a million trees throughout the following year.</p>
