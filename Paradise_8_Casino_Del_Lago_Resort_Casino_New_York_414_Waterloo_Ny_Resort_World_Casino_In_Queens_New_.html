    <h1>Paradise 8 Casino Del Lago Resort Casino New York 414 Waterloo Ny Resort World Casino In Queens New</h1>

<p>NorskRikstoto, Norway’s only horse racing operator, has selected BetMakers’ Global Tote as its new provider. Thanks to this agreement, Global Tate, which is owned by BetMakers will distribute its Quantum tote to NorskRikstoto and replace the current pari-mutuel wagering system of the operator.</p>
<p>NorskRikstoto Is Looking To Become More Competitive in the Market</p>
<p>The director of gaming services at NorskRikstoto, Christofer Moestue Huseby, shared a few words on the new agreement.</p>
<p>He said that the operator is extremely happy that it partnered with BetMakers and that it is looking forward to using the Global Tote solution in the most effective way. In doing so, NorskRikstoto is looking to become far more competitive in the “liberalized market.”</p>
<p>Huseby added that the Global Tote solutions are state-of-the-art and that they are more than capable of accommodating the “local betting and regulatory requirements.”</p>
<p>BetMakers’ CEO, Todd Buckingham, stated that the company is thrilled that it will get to expand its reach via Global Tote. He also added that the company will be able to broaden the engagement with NorskRikstoto and thus, deliver a new and unique betting system.</p>
<p>Global Tote’s Quantum engine will be provided as a fully-managed SaaS solution and it will be distributed to the terminal, web and mobile platforms of the Norwegian operator. Additionally, the system will be hosted from the AWS computing environment of Global Tote.</p>
<p>Norway Is Keen on Regulating the Gambling Industry in the Most Effective Way</p>
<p>Norway is among the numerous countries that seek to have full control over the gambling industry. In 2020, it agreed to launch account-based play. Norway’s regulatory body, Lotteritilsynet, stated that the industry should switch to this model across all products as it would increase consumer protection.</p>
<p>With the rise of offshore gambling, numerous players started wagering at these sites and hence, the country submitted a consultation paper to the European Commission in which it sought to mandate DNS blocking to operators that fail to cooperate and respect Norwegian laws.</p>
<p>The minister of culture of Norway, Abid Raja, stated that various offshore sites are trying to attract Norwegian players and if the new blocking system is approved, the country “will be able to gag them.” Raja also added that Norway will go to whatever distance needed to get rid of these companies.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Norwegian Media Authority is also keen on protecting customers, which is why it ordered 5 TV distributors to stop broadcasting gambling ads. It seems that the efforts to minimize the effect of offshore companies are widespread as authorities are working hard. In mid-February, the Norwegian Lotteries Authority issued a warning to Trannel, a Kindred subsidiary, of a daily coercive fine.</p>
