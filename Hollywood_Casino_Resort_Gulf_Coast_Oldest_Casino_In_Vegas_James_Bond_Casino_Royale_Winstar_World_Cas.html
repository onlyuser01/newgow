    <h1>Hollywood Casino Resort Gulf Coast Oldest Casino In Vegas James Bond Casino Royale Winstar World Cas</h1>

<p>SkillOnNet, a provider of iGaming platforms and supplier of operators of online casino operators and brands in the sector, has teamed up with Ezugi, making it possible for the latter’s distinguished Live Casino products to appear across numerous portfolios and trusted websites.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Adds Ezugi Live Casino Games</p>
<p>SkillOnNet provides technical solutions for PlayOJO, Metal Casino, Genting Casino, Spin Genie, and Slingo which will now benefit from Ezugi’s immersive portfolio of live titles available for integration with each of these brands and others. Ezugi features a number of excellent games that are player-favorite and welcome options.</p>
<p>The studio provides games such as Speed Roulette, Cricket War, and Andar Bahar among other prominent titles that are welcomed by SkillOnNet partner audiences and that add a nice touch to the overall portfolio. All games at Ezugi are run by professional live dealers who guide players through the process.</p>
<p>Streaming is done from advanced studios using the latest technology that guarantees fairness, immersion, and uninterrupted experience for all players. The partnership will initially focus exclusively on operators that cover Malta licensed markets, along with the United Kingdom and Spain, but the companies are confident that they will be able to continue expanding their offer in the months to come.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet head of games Jani Kontturi welcomed the partnership and addition of Ezugi titles to the SkillOnNet network of titles which now features more than 3,000 options across all major verticals, i.e. Slingo, bingo, table games, jackpots, and slots, scratch cards, and Live Casino. Kontturi said that the company will continue to seek and provide players and partners with the best possible experience and added:</p>
<p>Ezugi is a true pioneer in the live casino space and its suite of games offers something different. Titles such as Cricket War allow our brands to stand out from others and deals like this are why casinos such as PlayOJO and EU Casino are the number one destination for players across Europe.

<p>Ezugi business development director Pang Goh was equally excited about the partnership opportunity. He said that SkillOnNet is a top-performing operator and platform in Europe and well beyond, and by having Ezugi’s games listed there, the company has achieved a milestone.</p>
<p>“Each of our games has been developed to deliver thrilling and entertaining experiences from the first game round to the last, and we believe they will prove to be a big hit with players across SkillOnNet’s network of casino brands,” Goh concluded.</p>
