<p>The leading casino game aggregator, SoftGamings, expanded its European footprint last week. The company revealed Wednesday it entered the regulated gambling market in Romania. Although the announcement came last week, SoftGamings was allowed to roll out its services and products as of November 1, 2022. The recent announcement comes after the company secured a Class II license from the gambling regulator in the country, the Romanian National Gambling Office (ONJN). Thanks to this business-to-business license, aggregators such as SoftGamings, as well as operators, can legally introduce their services, gaming content, solutions and other B2B activities for operators in Romania.</p>
<p>In a statement released by SoftGamings, Anna Lalina, the company's director of partnerships, acknowledged that currently, the company caters to a portfolio of more than 250 partners. She predicted that the latest Class II license in Romania creates new opportunities for SoftGamings' list of operators to expand further.</p>
<p>"We look forward to potential partnerships and welcome operators to our services," Lalina added. Moreover, she explained that SoftGamings' product portfolio complies with the regulator requirements within multiple European markets. Finally, SoftGamings' director of partnerships said: "At the same time, our goal is to keep pushing forward, enter new local markets, and deliver new and innovative solutions for the entire casino gaming community."</p>
<p>Securing a license in Romania will undoubtedly bring benefits to the company. Current SoftGamings' B2B partners may consider expanding to the country, considering its Class II license. What's more, operators that have already established their presence in Romania can now join forces with the company.</p>
<p>"More than 100 top casino software providers are powering SoftGamings' casino solutions with over 3,000 of the hottest games," explained the company. Additionally, SoftGamings offers solutions that help drive fan engagement and improve operational management.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes on the heels of a partnership inked between SoftGamings and Gamzix, a fast-growing developer of high-quality video slots. The duo's collaboration dates back to June when SoftGamings added Gamzix's products to its API platform. This helped expand the company's offering while at the same time increasing the reach of Gamzix's quality products.</p>
<p>With more than 14 years of experience within the industry, SoftGamings is famous for offering innovative solutions, gaming platforms and turnkey gaming systems for the growing gambling industry. The company's current headcount surpasses 350 full-time employees.</p>
<p>SoftGamings' leading platform is highly-scalable and can process millions of transactions daily. This translates to some 30 billion transactions completed yearly. Overall, SoftGamings' has a growing list of more than 250 clients around the world that are happy with the company's leading services and solutions.</p>
