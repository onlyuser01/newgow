<p>The target is just £6,000 shy of the expected sum, and a number of prominent companies participated in the backing of the zone, designed to spread awareness about problem gambling and how businesses stand to benefit from tackling the issue on an industry level.</p>
<p>Consumer Protection Is Now an Indelible Part of ICE’s Identity</p>
<p>Among the companies donating were prominent leaders, such as IGT, Betsson, Greentube, and Kindred Group, along with Flutter, all of which pledging more than £5,000. Les Ambassadeurs contributed another £10,000. The backers of the event’s Consumer Protection Zone have raised more than £186,000 in the past four editions of the event, demonstrating that the industry as a whole is taking problem gambling more seriously than ever before.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming’s director of industry insight and engagement, Ewa Bakun, welcomed this opportunity and said that the zone was first introduced in 2018 and hosted eight exhibitions. Now, things have been scaled up as consumer protection remains the core focus of businesses in 2023.</p>
<p>This year’s edition will feature more than 20 exhibitors, including charities, treatment facilities, and various not-for-profit entities, all of which are reunited in their goal of ensuring that consumers are safe and protected. Others will include responsible gambling tool providers, commercial organizations, and more.</p>
<p>The Consumer Protection Zone plays a crucial area and has been recognized by the 2022 Global Regulatory Awards for its contributions towards improving the overall informational landscape about problem gambling.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest edition of the Consumer Protection Zone, Betsson Group Head of Sustainability Jonna Danlund said that the initiative is shaping up as an important way to educate and raise awareness about the issue. Danlund added:</p>
<p>We believe that it is essential for the industry to work together to promote responsible gaming and showcase the work that is being done as it is fundamental for the long-term sustainability of the industry and the well-being of our customers. Betsson Group Head of Sustainability Jonna Danlund</p>
<p>Flutter head of safer gambling strategy Lisa O’Connor was equally pleased with the opportunity to back the Consumer Protection Zone another year. The dedicated zone plays a crucial role in informing industry leaders and stakeholders about the latest developments, innovations, and opportunities in the area of safer gambling and player protection.</p>
<p>“It is a real focal point for many guests attending the event, and its continued success demonstrates how important Safer Gambling is to colleagues in the industry,” O’Connor said.</p>
