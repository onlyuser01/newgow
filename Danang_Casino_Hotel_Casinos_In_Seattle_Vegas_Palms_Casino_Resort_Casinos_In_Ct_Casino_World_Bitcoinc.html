    <h1>Danang Casino Hotel Casinos In Seattle Vegas Palms Casino Resort Casinos In Ct Casino World Bitcoinc</h1>

<p>Good morning ,</p>
<p>this is a dramatic situation.</p>
<p>I have been having problems with gambling addiction for years. I try to fight this evil with all the possibilities I have but at the moment he is winning.</p>
<p>I joined this casino way back in 2019. I made my first deposit on 17.12.2019 for an amount of 250.00 euros. I requested self-exclusion for addiction, by writing to the address given by them on their website. I stuck to their T &amp; Cs but no one listened to me. In 2019 I played € 1250.00. I wrote them to block my account on 18.12.2019 (as per correspondence that I am attaching) no one listened to me. I tried to contact them again on 03.01.2020 and even here no one listened to me. I tried to heal myself, in every way, despite not having the support from the casino in blocking my account. Unfortunately, they continued to send me promotional emails despite my multiple requests for self-exclusion for gambling addiction. I resisted as long as I could and then I fell back. Yesterday, or the 06.11.2022 unfortunately I fell back and played again an important amount, divided into three different deposits (€ 286.22, € 479.89, € 383.61).</p>
<p>I also wrote those 3 different emails, the last one this morning, but no one has ever answered me. My account is still active and it is possible to deposit money. I don't want to do it, but I'm sick and I'm having a hard time resisting.</p>
<p>I only ask for a refund of the amounts deposited for a total of € 2,399.72. I am trying to heal, but the failure to protect these messes is completely destroying me.</p>
<p>Casino guru, please help me.</p>
