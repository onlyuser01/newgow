<p>In his new role, Carter is expected to help GiG's Platform and Sportsbook division grow after its separation from the company</p>
<p>The leading developer of iGaming solutions, services and products, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced a new senior-level appointment Monday. The company revealed it hired the services of the iGaming expert with wide experience, Richard Carter. Joining GiG, he was appointed to the role of CEO of the company’s Platform and Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Carter, an experienced leader with significant knowledge, is going to play a key role in the growth of GiG’s Platform and Sportsbook business segment. His appointment comes ahead of a planned separation of GiG and its Platform and Sportsbook business.</p>
<p>Recently, the company unveiled details regarding the planned separation. It is expected to benefit the Platform and Sportsbook business, as well as GiG, enabling the two companies to grow separately and capture new market opportunities.</p>
<p>The unique experience and deep industry knowledge that Carter brings are expected to play an important role in the separation process. The latest appointment follows an extensive process that sought to identify the best candidate that can fit the role and propel the growth of GiG’s Platform and Sportsbook division.</p>
<p>Under Carter’s guidance, the division is expected to grow further within the competitive iGaming market. Leveraging his experience, the new CEO is expected to help the company continue to deliver its technology via software-as-a-service (SaaS) to a growing portfolio of more than 40 business partners in 35 markets around the globe. Although Carter’s appointment was announced this week, GiG explained that he will join the company starting on September 18, 2023.</p>
<p>Carter Brings Extensive Experience</p>
<p>Petter Nylander, GiG’s chairman of the Board, welcomed Carter to the company’s C-suite. He said that GiG is excited to see him join the company for this important role. Finally, Nylander noted: “The Board believes Richard Carter has the relevant experience, given his success as CEO of SBTech and has shown an impressive and deep understanding of the GiG business, its opportunities and provided thoughtful strategic considerations on how to build on the recent success of the Platform and Sportsbook business and driving shareholder value.”</p>
<p>Carter was similarly delighted and said that it is thrilling to join GiG at such a transformational time. He spoke about the leading technology and solutions that GiG offers for the iGaming sector. Additionally, Carter pointed out that GiG’s division is positioned well to continue growing and expanding its footprint. Last but not least, he said that he is looking forward to playing an important role in the future of GiG’s Platform and Sportsbook business.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, Carter brings a solid background after being a part of leading companies within the iGaming sector. His professional career includes a CEO role with SBTech, as well as a CEO role with Bragg. Moreover, he was also a director of research at Deutsche Bank. Throughout Carter’s professional career, he was able to accumulate significant knowledge and understanding of the iGaming sector, qualities that are undoubtedly going to help him in his new role with GiG.</p>
