<p>Pragmatic Play continues to build up its momentum across the globe and the supplier of premier iGaming products across multiple categories, to name live casino, slots, jackpots, table games, and bingo, among others, has now signed a new partnership with Livescore Bet in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The partnership will help Pragmatic Play to further expand its reach and footprint in Dutch iGaming and bring players worthwhile products that are there to provide them with excellent gaming options through and through.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Livescore Bet players will have the opportunity to access a range of noteworthy games and titles provided by Pragmatic, to name excellent choices such as John Hunter and the Book of Tut Respin, Aztec Blaze, Gates of Olympus, Sweet Bonanza and so many others.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been picking up the pace of its content partnerships, negotiating a series of important tie-ups to provide its content to prominent operators in different markets, including Sysgaming, Aposta.la, Bplay, and more. This week, Pragmatic Play also expanded with Tinbet in Peru, consolidating its Latin American presence.</p>
<p>The latest partnership has been welcomed by Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides who said that the supplier was delighted to be teaming up with Livescore Bet and offer its content to one of the leading iGaming properties in the regulated Dutch market. She added:</p>
<p>"Providing our extensive and high-quality slots portfolio to operators globally is key to our continued development and growth strategy."</p>
<p>Livescore Group marketing director Richard Leask was similarly pleased with these developments and said that the Pragmatic Play will definitely help the Group and its brand succeed after launching only recently in the country.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has definitely been doing its best to make sure that it remains active in securing new market shares and opportunities. With this in mind, the company recently signed a partnership with Technamin. Earlier in November, Pragmatic Play agreed to provide content to World Sports Betting and NorthStar Bets.</p>
<p>The Netherlands remains one of the most important markets for iGaming operators in Europe, as the country has made it possible for suppliers to join a new highly lucrative even though heavily regulated market. Still, iGaming stakeholders have been very happy to pounce at this opportunity.</p>
