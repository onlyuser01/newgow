    <h1>The Artesian Hotel Casino Spa Sulphur Ok Sun Palace Casino Bobby Casino 200 Free Chip Penn National</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru!</p>
<p>The casino is refusing to pay my 0.0348395 BTC despite satisfying multiple requirements by chat, which are NOT stated in their terms and conditions.</p>
<p>On 2023/07/20 09:46:22 I deposited 0.01563547 BTC to the website, which I accumulated up above 0.034 BTC, without taking any bonuses.</p>
<p>When I wanted to withdraw this amount of money, my withdrawals got rejected.</p>
<p>The chat said my withdrawal amount is capped because I have not reached VIP level 2 on their site.</p>
<p>First off, there is nothing that states this on their terms and conditions page, but I was furious, so played along.</p>
<p>I played some roulette really quickly to scale up my VIP level and I got lucky, I managed to hit VIP level 2.</p>
<p>The chat agent changed his statements and told me that he was saying it incorrectly, I WAS level 2 all along, but I need to reach level 3, which is of course, a blatant lie.</p>
<p>This time I have taken a screenshot of my level 2 status, and tried my luck on roulette again. To my luck, I reached level 3 with a minimum loss of my funds to where I arrived at 0.034838935 BTC. I was so happy now that I can finally withdraw my funds.</p>
<p>Then, the chat agent said that my withdrawal is rejected again because of limits, and I can only withdraw 0.0035 BTC. What?? There is nothing on the site that says this.</p>
<p>T&amp;C says this:</p>
<p>9.6. In cases when your balance is at least 10 times larger than the total sum of your deposits, you will be limited to € 5,000 (or currency equivalent) for withdrawal per month. In other cases the maximum withdrawal amount per month is € 10,000.</p>
<p>None of those rules are broken, what they are saying makes no sense. I have also attached my transaction history! I had one previous withdrawal at the sum of 0.0320513 which has been processed successfully on the 20th of July, but they do not want to do it with the current one.</p>
<p>I also attached the full chat history and you can see the conversation unfold yourself.</p>
<p>I want two things with this complaint:</p>
<p>Make bet999.io pay me my funds as I have completed the chat agent's requirements even when they are not stated in their terms and conditions. If they fail to do so, I would like to get help on reporting them to the regulators, and also take their safe rating down from Casino Guru, as it was the main reason I have chosen them to play.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance Casino Guru. For any other questions that need to be answered by me, I am at your disposal.</p>
<p>Oh, and my account is not yet verified, as they have not asked me to do the verification to be able to withdraw. I am 100% willing to do it, but the chat has not even mentioned verification.</p>
<p>(The disputed amount is 0.03483935 BTC, which I could not specify when submitting the complaint)</p>
