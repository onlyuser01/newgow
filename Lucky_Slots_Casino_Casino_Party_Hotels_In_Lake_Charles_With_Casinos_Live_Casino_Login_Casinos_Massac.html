<p>Double Bonus Poker - Full Pay RTP over 100%</p>
<p>Double Bonus Poker is variation of Jacks or Better Video Poker, with extra payouts for selected Four of a kind hands. Four Aces will win you an 800 credit payout (when playing 5 credits).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the full pay version, which pays 100.17%, is not available online, and nowadays it’s also very rare at land based casinos. But it is still an excellent Video Poker game featuring a higher variance at 28.3, meaning you’ll require about 20% more bankroll than you would when playing Jacks or Better. More time passes between your wins, but once you hit something, there is a better chance that it’s going to be a big win.</p>
<p>Full pay Double Bonus Poker paytable</p>
<p>The paytable for full pay Double Bonus Poker is also called 10-7 (10 single coin payouts for a Full House and 7 single coin payouts for a flush) or 50-10-7-5 (50 single coins payout for Four of a Kind 5-K, and 5 coins payout for a straight are added). Other, lower paying versions of Double Bonus usually have one of these three payouts adjusted, which results in a lower payout.</p>
<p>The most common Double Bonus Poker games online are either 45-10-7-5 (99.37% RTP - usually available at RTG casinos) or 50-10-7-5 (99.11% RTP). However, the best theoretical payout available online is 99.92%, provided by the All Aces version of Double Bonus Poker available at Microgaming casinos. We recommend 32 Red Casino as one of the best, if not the best Microgaming casino. Players from selected countries can get a £10 free no deposit bonus, which can be also used on Video Poker games.</p>
<p>All Aces Poker - Microgaming Double Bonus Poker with a 99.92% RTP</p>
<p>Another important fact to remember is the huge variance of the All Aces version of Double Bonus, which is as high as 65.2. That means you will need about 80% bigger bankroll than in Jacks or Better to play for the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Double Bonus Poker Strategy</p>
<p>The strategy for Double Bonus Video Poker is adjusted from standard, because of the increased payouts for selected four of a kind hands. Actually, besides this increased payout for four of a kind, and the decreased payout for 2 pairs, the game is quite similar to Jacks or Better. It is possible to use the Jacks or Better strategy when playing full pay Double Bonus, but the theoretical payout decreases to around 99.65%.</p>
<p>Also, remember that even when you follow the basic or even the perfect strategy, Double Bonus Poker features a very high variance, so you have to expect to lose more sessions than you win. However, many of the winning session will feature big wins (especially for selected four of a kinds), when the "gambling gods" are on your side.</p>

<p>Free Double Bonus Poker</p>
<p>The best way to learn to play Double Bonus Poker for free with no download required is to play online. All Aces is a Double Bonus Video Poker game with the best payout out of those that can be found online. This game can be found at Microgaming online casinos.</p>
<p>Some of these Microgaming casinos even offer no deposit casino bonuses which can be used to play Video Poker games. However, the contribution to your wagering requirements is usually lower than when playing slots.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of Microgaming casinos is that the software automatically holds cards based on the perfect strategy, so you don’t have to worry about making any mistakes. We have checked the feature during a sample of 100 hands, and the held hands were correct based on our basic strategy, as well as the perfect strategy. A downside is that not all Microgaming casinos offer their players free games with no registration required. It might be a bit trickier to play Double Bonus Poker for fun as a result of that.</p>
