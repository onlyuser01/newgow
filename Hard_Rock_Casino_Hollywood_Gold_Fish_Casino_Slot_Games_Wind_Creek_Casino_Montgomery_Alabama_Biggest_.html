<p>Playson Continues Expansion in Latin America, Inks Agreement with Virtualsoft</p>
<p>The leading game developer, Playson, announced today that it inked a partnership with Virtualsoft, the dynamic platform provider. The partnership comes at a time when Playson has already gained momentum and continues its expansion in Latin America.</p>
<p>As a result of the latest agreement, popular Playson titles will be integrated with Virtualsoft’s partners, such as Doradobet. The agreement will bring titles such as Hand of Gold, Solar Temple, as well as Wolf Power: Hold and Win. Furthermore, only recently, Playson introduced a new UI, specially designed for mobile gaming in portrait mode. This will undoubtedly prove to be beneficial for Virtualsoft, considering that the demand for mobile content in Latin America continues to increase.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Bring Benefits for the Two Companies</p>
<p>In a statement, Jose Luis Osorio, head of new business at Virtualsoft, shared his excitement by saying that Playson’s products have kept consistently high standards over the years. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the recent enhancements have made Playson’s offering even more exciting. In conclusion, Osorio said that Virtualsoft is thrilled to team up with Playson and looks forward to a successful business relationship.</p>
<p>Playson’s sales director, Blanka Homor, also shared her excitement about the latest agreement. She acknowledged that Playson is delighted to continue its LatAm expansion. Furthermore, Homor said that Playson’s expansion is complemented by the agreement with Virtualsoft, which is a key player within the region.</p>
<p>This year, Playson continues to expand its partnership network by signing new agreements with both platform providers and operators. As a result, the company continues to increase its reach by entering key markets. Recently, in February, Playson inked a deal with Kaizen Gaming, a leading game tech company in Greece. Consequently, Kaizen Gaming’s brands in Greece received access to a suite of Playson popular titles.</p>
