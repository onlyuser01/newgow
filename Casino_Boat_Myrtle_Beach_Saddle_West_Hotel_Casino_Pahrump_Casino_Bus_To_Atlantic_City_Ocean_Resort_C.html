    <h1>Casino Boat Myrtle Beach Saddle West Hotel Casino Pahrump Casino Bus To Atlantic City Ocean Resort C</h1>

<p>Illegal gambling websites have been targeting consumers around the globe with no fear of any consequences. ACMA, the Australian media regulator, has recently reached out to Curacao’s government, asking the jurisdiction to do more in limiting the reach of websites that are licensed in the market but target customers in Australia.</p>
<p>Globally, regulators have been more vigilant about wrongdoers that encroach on their jurisdictions or offer unauthorized products, or generally try to conduct business without licenses. Now, the PhilippineAmusement and Gaming Corporation or PAGCOR has issued a similar warning, cautioning local and foreign nationals to be careful when they access online gambling products, as there are many instances of illegal sites.</p>
<p>One website that was specifically called out in the press release published by the regulator was "starspangled 200 dot org." Normally, PAGCOR would not bother too much with an individual rogue site, but "starspangled 200 dot org" was used by fraudsters in a dangerous way. The website is a reference to the recent campaign launched in the state of Maryland in the United States with the site’s name printed out on 800,000 registered vehicle plates to promote the state’s history.</p>
<p>However, fraudsters were quick enough to hijack the website and make it redirect to another domain, "globe international dot info," which authorities in the Philippines claim is linked to illegal gambling. PAGCOR has insisted that the website has put the country in a bad light and the regulator, as well as authorities, are now determined to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>"PAGCOR has nothing to do with the said websites, as well as the gaming activities happening therein. As the country’s gaming regulator, PAGCOR does not condone illegal online gambling," the regulator stated categorically, distancing itself from any illegal activities that may have been conducted through the domains.</p>
<p>The organization doubled down on its commitment to work with national regulators and governments in order to ensure that it flags such attempts at fraud through illegal gambling platforms and notifies partners aroundtheworld about potential violations. PAGCOR CEO Alejandro Tengco said that the case has been referred to the appropriate government and enforcement agencies for further investigation.</p>
<p>As to the actual way the fraudsters pulled off their nefarious activity, there are a few theories. The original domain, "starspangled 200 dot org" was owned by Maryland as part of a plan in 2007 to promote the state’s history and the War of 1812. However, a mix-up was made as the domain name was not renewed 15 years after the fact, allowing it to lapse and for the fraudsters to opportunistically snap it up and cause a global diplomatic headache in a sense.</p>
