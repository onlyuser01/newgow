<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming ControlBoard has posted its latest results, covering the period for January 2023. Gambling operations in the Keystone State were off to a strong start in the first month of the year, as results improved 18% year-over-year, posting a total of $464,488,191. In January 2022, that number stood at $393,144,086, a noticeably smaller number than the present results.</p>
<p>The results once again covered all sources of revenue in the state that were generated through legal and regulated gambling activities, including fantasy contests, VGTs, sports betting, table and slot casino games, and internet gaming. The PGCB tracked results across 19 gambling facilities in the state, with the majority of them seeing strong year-over-year improvement in their results.</p>
<p>Big gains in annual results were realized by properties such as Valley Forge Casino Resort which posted a total of $67,878,145 in total revenue, up 33.17% year-over-year. Live! Casino Philadelphia collected a total of $25,377,249, a 51.68% increase from last year’s results. Hollywood Casino Morgantown gained a 79.99% increase comparing 2023’s performance to 2022, with $7,946,856 in total revenue collected.</p>
<p>Other properties continued to post excellent performance across the board. Hollywood Casino at Penn National brought in the biggest chunk of revenue for the month with $71,834,201, or an increase of 25.44% comparing annual results. Rivers Casino Philadelphia then saw a 15.50% increase to $48,744,410 in January 2023.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Bethlehem and Mount Airy CasinoResorts saw $45,093,932 and $20,607,739 in total revenue, a 17.24% and 12.58% increase respectively. Some of the smaller gains were realized by Rivers Casino Pittsburgh which posted $29,061,421 or 1.81% gain year-over-year. Harrah’s Philadelphia saw $17,592,129 in total revenue which was only a 1.15% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>A handful of properties saw a dip in their overall results. Most notably, there was Presque Isle Downs and Casino saw its results go down by 13.60% to $8,361,609, compared to $9,678,237 in total revenue in January 2022. In terms of which segment did best, it’s not surprising that retail slots revenue continued to lead the way and even made significant gains in 2023.</p>
<p>The revenue from the vertical stood at $202,240,506, or up 20.07% on January 2022’s $168,441,692 results. Interactive slot revenue or iGaming slot revenue was nearly half that amount, at $90,201,543, also notching up a 25.57% gain. Retail table revenue seemed to be doing fairly modestly, but still experiencing an increase with total revenue hitting $83,912,666, up 7.27%.</p>
