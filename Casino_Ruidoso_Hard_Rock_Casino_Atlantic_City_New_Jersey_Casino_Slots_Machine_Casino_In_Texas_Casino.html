    <h1>Casino Ruidoso Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City New Jersey Casino Slots Machine Casino In Texas Casino</h1>

<p>The new partnership sees Greco provide the prominent gambling group with a dedicated risk engine solution that will help steer the Group on its journey toward sustainable and safe gameplay for players.</p>
<p>Greco and Betsson Group Elevate Player Protection in Real-Time</p>
<p>Betsson seeks to improve overall player management and efficiency, and to get there, the company wants to have a better read of real-time indicators that could point to problem gambling or other issues with individual players and accounts.</p>
<p>Betsson has made a commitment towards negating the revenue it generates from problem gambling completely. The Group has doubled down on its commitment by teaming up with prominent partners from the sector, with the latest being Greco.</p>
<p>Commenting on this latest foray to keep players protected, Betsson Group director of analytics Dragica Krsteva said that the analytics team has already had the opportunity to work with Greco on several occasions and see first-hand how well the solution and company are able to tackle important shared priorities. Krsteva added:</p>
<p>We value their advanced and ground-breaking approach to detecting unfavorable player behavior and developing better strategies on mitigating such risks. We are thrilled to be early adopters of their new technology and we are excited for the future of our partnership with Greco. Dragica Krsteva, Betsson Group director of analytics</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by Greco co-founder and CEO Ozric Vondervelden who said that the company was extremely thrilled to be teaming up with Betsson Group. Vondervelden confirmed that his company wanted to ensure that it’s able to read into risky behavior undertaken by players in every situation.</p>
<p>He further hailed Betsson’s own world-class analytics team and spoke about the collaboration’s potentially transformative effect on the entire industry. Meanwhile, the Greco platform continues to evolve through the addition of new modules and features, tailored to the needs of players.</p>
<p>Maintaining Robust Commercial Development Pace</p>
<p>On the commercial front, Betsson has been maintaining a strong presence in both iGaming and sports betting. The company signed a recent content deal with R. Franco Digital, a provider of online casino products. Betsson also became the sponsor of Chile’s top-flight soccer league and extended its naming rights for Liga 1 in Peru.</p>
