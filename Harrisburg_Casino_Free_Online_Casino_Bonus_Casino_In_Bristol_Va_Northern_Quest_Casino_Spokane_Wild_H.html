<p>Horseshoe Lake Charles, Caesars Entertainment’s latest casino resort, is set to open doors for guests on December 12. The property has been on shutdown for the past two years following the devastation it suffered during Hurricane Laura and the double-whammy inflicted by the subsequent pandemic and downturn in land-based gaming, hospitality, and entertainment.</p>
<p>Bringing Familiar Location Under New Lease of Life</p>
<p>The casino resort, though, is returning in style and it will offer Louisiana’s first Gordon Ramsay restaurant which sprawls on 60,000 square feet, set to open next year and after the main property has launched fully. As to players from the state and beyond, Caesars Entertainment’s new venue gaming floor will be precisely what they expect it to be.</p>
<p>The casino section will feature more than 1,000 slot machines along with dozens of table games, not least a sportsbook and more than 250 hotel rooms. Reservations are already available to customers, Caesars Entertainment confirmed in an official media communication. Company COO and president Anthony Carano said that reopening the property admitted that the initial damage caused by the hurricane did catch management by surprise.</p>
<p>“We were not expecting the property to be shut down for this length of time,” Carano said. However, the wait has been worth it, he added, and the team was proud to have revived and improved on the Horseshoe Lake Charles, a new property for all intents and purposes:</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming our partners and the community to celebrate with us as we commemorate this milestone and introduce them to Horseshoe Lake Charles. Company COO and president Anthony Carano</p>
<p>The Team Behind Horseshoe Lake Charles Excited to Welcome Guests</p>
<p>Horseshoe Lake Charles general manager and SVP Jeff Favre was similarly enthusiastic about the partnership and said that the team couldn’t wait to have guests welcomed back to the new all-resort experience. He added:</p>
<p>After being closed for more than two years, reopening as a Horseshoe casino is a cherry on top of a pretty spectacular celebration. Horseshoe Lake Charles general manager and SVP Jeff Favre</p>
<p>The property was previously known as Isle of Capri but was renamed and rebranded under a new marketing push that wanted to give the location a new lease of life and break away from its unfortunate-ridden past. The rebranding seems to have been successful.</p>
<p>The ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place at the specified date in December and the day will wrap up with fireworks. The Horseshoe properties are available in ten locations in the United States and the brand is one of the flagship assets owned by Caesars Entertainment to date.</p>
