<p>Section 11: Security</p>
<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to ask you to provide us with additional documents as part of our Enhanced Due Diligence process such as proof of the payment method used and source of wealth. We may also request further proof of identification relating to the details you have used to register your Account. Any such additional identification will be kept confidential. We further reserve the right to disclose your details, under certain circumstances such as those required by law. Further details on our identity verification procedure can be found in Section 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this instance I can see that we had asked you to provide us with confirmation showing the phone bill for number ending 547 has been paid up to date. This is to show that the deposits you have made with us recently had been settled with your mobile phone network provider. This was requested from you as you deposited to us and requested a withdrawal without any gameplay. Regrettably we cannot predict what deposit methods our players may choose to use, which is why this information cannot be requested in advance.</p>
<p>On review of the information which was received from you and applied to your account we identified some inconsistences with the document you provided which raised concerns regarding the legitimacy of the documents, and as such the decision has been made to close your accounts and void your withdrawals. The possibility of this happening is detailed in the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>Section 10: Closing and Suspending Accounts</p>
<p>Our Rights to Close and Suspend Your Account</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to close or suspend an Account in any of the following circumstances:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we have requested additional information relating to identification or proof of payment of a phone bill or source of funds/wealth and the Player has failed to provide such information your account will be suspended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we are legally obliged to do so; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we reasonably suspect "suspicious activity" (see Section 13 below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Touch Games reserves the absolute right and without limitation to close your account on reasonable notice to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Section 13: Suspicious Activity</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purpose of this Section 13, "suspicious activity" shall refer to where we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have placed a bet or a number of bets in suspicious circumstances or in contravention of these Terms and Conditions. Suspicious circumstances include but are not limited to:</li>
</ol>
<p>c. where we have reason to believe that you are misusing the mobile billing facility, including without limitation where you deposit funds via phone bill and subsequently do not pay your phone bill;</p>
<ol>
<li>In the case of any suspicious activity, we may, at our sole discretion, depending on the situation:</li>
</ol>
<p>a. request reasonable further information from you to investigate whether the bet(s) constitute(s) suspicious betting;</p>
<p>b. suspend your Account and withhold payment of any withdrawals until we have receipt of satisfactory evidence (in our reasonable opinion) from you for us to determine that the deposits are in your name, that play is not fraudulent or any other purpose connected to our concerns of "suspicious activity". For example, but without limitation, where we suspect that you have deposited funds via a mobile phone account which is not in your name or you are in default of settlement of your mobile phone bill, we may ask you to provide reasonable evidence that the mobile phone account is yours and that you have settled the mobile phone bill that you used to deposit funds before you can withdraw any winnings;</p>
<p>d. void or refuse all or any part of any bet, suspend your Account or withhold payment of any amounts (or any parts thereof), for a period of time that may reasonably be required (for example, pending any investigations by our Internal Security Team, a gambling regulator, a law enforcement authority or any other third party with jurisdiction).</p>
<p>While we understand that this may not be the response you had anticipated, we do hope that our explanation on arriving at this decision is clear. On this occasion regrettably there would not be an alternate resolution we can offer.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
