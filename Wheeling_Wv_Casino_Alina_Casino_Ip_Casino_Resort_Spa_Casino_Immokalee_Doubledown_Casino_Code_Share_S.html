<p>Stephen Thompson Ready to End His Losing Streak</p>
<p>Born and raised in South Carolina, Wonderboy will feel at home on Saturday in Orlando. The crowd will probably be on his side, which could help him end his two-fight losing streak. It started with a loss to Gilbert Burns, followed by a loss to Belal Muhammad. Thompson lost by a decision both times.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, five of his six losses happened by decision. The only time he lost within the distance was in 2019 when Anthony Pettis beat him by knockout.</p>
<p>When it comes to his wins, most of them too happened by decision. He won eight fights this way, while also winning seven times by KO/TKO and once by submission.</p>
<p>Now that you know this, you know that he is an athletic fighter with incredible stamina, who’s a great striker. What you should also know is that this is because he’s got a background in kickboxing which he’s been practising since 1999.</p>
<p>Kevin Holland Ready to Take a Big Step Forward</p>
<p>Holland is one of the most underestimated UFC fights. This may seem like a bold statement, but we really think Big Mouth deserves more praise. Not only does he have a pretty decent record, but his fights are usually very fun to watch.</p>
<p>Holland signed for the UFC after doing great in Dana Whites Contender Series 9. His UFC journey didn’t start great, with a 3-2 record in the first two years. However, the year 2020 then came which saw him win five fights, thus tying the UFC record for most wins within one calendar year. The following year was nowhere as great – he lost twice while one of his fights was declared no contest.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he got back into the spotlight with two impressive wins (vs Alex Oliveira and Tim Means), both of which got him the Performance of the Night bonus. His most recent fight, though, saw him lose to Khamzat Chimaev by submission.</p>
<p>Stephen Thompson vs Kevin Holland Prediction</p>
<p>Kevin Holland might never become a champ, but this guy’s fights are incredibly fun to watch. He’s coming to Florida to beat the hell out of Thompson. Whether he’s going to succeed in his intention remains to be seen. Nevertheless, we’ll probably see a real spectacle, meaning that one of them will likely end up on the floor.</p>
<p>Picks: Kevin Holland to win by knockout/technical knockout.</p>
