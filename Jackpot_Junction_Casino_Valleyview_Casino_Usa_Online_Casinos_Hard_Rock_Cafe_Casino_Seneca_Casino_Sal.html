    <h1>Jackpot Junction Casino Valleyview Casino Usa Online Casinos Hard Rock Cafe Casino Seneca Casino Sal</h1>

<p>Dear, Betsofa!</p>
<p>Can you, please, stop your lies? I'm not an idiot!</p>
<p>No, providers, isn't checking any bets, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Almost all complaints for Betsofa are about slow payments (ask, guru)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You refuse to provide any evidence of bet checking process. (it's confidencial! how convenient of you!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For my 10 years of online gambling experience, it's my 1st such long payment!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(you can't pay me this super big win of $1343 for 35 days as for now, lmao.)</p>
<ol>
<li>In complaints, I've seen that some ppl won in your casino a big amounts of money, recently. For example, 2 ppl for 8k euro, one for 4k, and, especially one for 74k$!</li>
</ol>
<p>This all in a 2023 year. Moreover, some of these complaints are still pending, 8k and 74k!</p>
<p>Thus, it's very clear that you have some problems with your business. But, it's not my fault. Stop lie to me, and start making, atleast, partial payments!</p>
<p>And, as I see in my recent experience with Betsofa, no one is responsible for anything: the casino repeats the same thing, the providers who do not answer, Gaming Curacao, where I wrote about the casino, they do not answer either.</p>
<p>I just don't have any rights. And you all can get away with it, freely!</p>
