    <h1>Stratosphere Casino Hotel Tower Casinoes Everygame Casino Dreams Casino No Deposit Michigan Casino R</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. We accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here (correct me if I am wrong, please).</p>
<p>Regarding the account closure – please understand the casino doesn’t have to have a set time frame during which it closes the player’s account.</p>
<p>Please, if there is anything else, we could help you with, do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, we will reject this complaint. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
