<p>Software supplier Tom Horn Gaming and gambling group and operator Condor Gaming Group have teamed up for content. As a result, Tom Horn Gaming will provide its full portfolio of titles to the operator and its brands and offer players the opportunity to experience excellent and established titles such as Tournaverse, LuckyBull, Gambeta10, and so much more.</p>
<p>Other popular choices here include 243 Crystal Fruits, 81 Frutas Grandes, and more. Condor Gaming Group is particularly happy with this partnership as Tom Horn Gaming will further provide the operator with loyalty systems, a number of gamification tools, and more to drive the best possible experience for players.</p>
<p>Tom Horn Gaming is confident that its titles will strike home with players of various backgrounds and demographics, owing to the developer’s motley game genres. Company CEO Ondrej Lapides hailed the opportunity to collaborate with Condor Gaming.</p>
<p>He further added that he was happy to provide players with safe and unique gambling experiences across the board, and "push the boundaries of online casino entertainment." The executive added:</p>
<p>"We always strive to bring a large variety of best-in-class gaming experiences to our distinctive player base around the world."</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly lauded by Condor Gaming CMO Prash Patel who was happy with the variety of mechanics and features that these new titles brought around as part of the portfolio. Patel further noted that the new additions are bound to appeal to the company’s players in various markets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership should lead to "substantial growth for both companies," Patel said. Meanwhile, Tom Horn Gaming has been on a tear. The company has been able to break into other markets and expand with regional operators and iGaming platforms.</p>
<p>In early December, Tom Horn Gaming teamed up with Fortuna to boost its reach in the Romanian iGaming market, part of the broader company pivot towards Eastern Europe. Tom Horn similarly boosted its presence in Sazka in the Czech Republic in November.</p>
