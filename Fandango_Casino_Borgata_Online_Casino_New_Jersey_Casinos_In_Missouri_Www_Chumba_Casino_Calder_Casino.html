<p>Las Vegas resident Qui Nguyen won the World Series of Poker Main Event at the Rio in Las Vegas in the early hours of Wednesday morning, following a grueling eight-hour heads-up battle against Gordon Vayo.</p>

<p>Nguyen proved himself to be a gutsy passionate player, whose flamboyant dress sense is reminiscent of that other Vietnamese-American poker world champion, Scotty Nguyen. But in contrast to his famous namesake, Qui Nguyen was a relative unknown before his triumph at the Penn and Teller Theater this morning.</p>
<p>A former nail salon owner turned professional baccarat player, he has only one previous cash in a World Series event, in 2009, for just over $9,000. Prior to the $ 8,005,310 he won this morning, it was also his biggest cash.</p>
<p>Josephy’s Rollercoaster</p>
<p>Three players returned from Monday to play Tuesday evening’s final, with Nguyen holding the chip lead and Cliff Josephy, the most experienced of the three, nursing the short-stack. The fireworks started early when Josephy doubled through Nyguen to leapfrog Vayo into second place.</p>
<p>But just four hands later, Josephy ran his lower set into Vayo’s top set (deuces vs threes), a brutal cooler that crippled his stack. Two double-ups later, and Josephy was miraculously again in contention, before losing a chunk of chips to Nguyen. Vayo quickly finished him off.</p>
<p>Play had lasted barely an hour and it had been a rollercoaster ride for Josephy, but if anyone thought it was an indication that this would be a quick final, they were wrong.</p>
<p>Lengthy Poker Duel</p>
<p>When Nguyen and Vayo squared off for heads up, Vayo had the slight chip lead, with around 60 percent of the chips, but there was still a lot of play in those stacks, as we were to discover. The action was cagey, a war of attrition, and Vayo, in particular, played with a cautiousness that befitted his sensible haircut.</p>
<p>“I was just telling myself, ‘Don’t give up. Don’t give up.’ I was so tired, you know?” said an emotional Nguyen afterwards. “But I was saying don’t give up. For my family . . . for my wife, my dad, my sister, everybody who supported me . . .Don’t make a misstep. When you misstep, you’re done. I just wanted to do the best I can for the show . . . I wasn’t thinking about win or lose, I was just, in my mind, thinking no misstep.”</p>
<p>Nguyen’s adrenaline-addled exhaustion was evident as he struggled to find the right words in his heavily accented and broken English.</p>
<p>“New Age of Poker”</p>
<p>Hours later, on the 364th hand of the final table, Vayo shoved his short-stack over Nguyen’s button raise holding J♠T♠, and his opponent, holding K♣T♣, made the call. A flop of K-8-7 gave Vayo’s dominated hand a double gutshot’s hope, but two turn and river blanks later, the house erupted.</p>
<p>A representative for the exhausted Nguyen said that a portion of the winnings would be donated to the Wounded Warrior Project for veteran servicemen and women, as a thank you for those who protect him and his adopted country.</p>
<p>“He wants to represent poker to take poker to another level, kind of like the Moneymaker Effect,” said the representative. “We believe it’s time for the new age of poker.”</p>
