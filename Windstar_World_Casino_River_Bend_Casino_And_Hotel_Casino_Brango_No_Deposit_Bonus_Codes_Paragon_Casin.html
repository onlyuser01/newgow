<p>Greektown Casino-Hotel, one of the three Detroit city casinos, will soon be renamed Hollywood Casino, Penn National Gaming (PNG) announced today.</p>
<p>Rebranding Comes with Additional Amenities</p>
<p>Effective May 1 and subject to customary regulatory approvals, the 100,000-square-foot gaming, entertainment, and dining destination and 30-story hotel in Detroit’s Greektown Historic District will go under Penn’s flagship Hollywood Casino banner and will bring changes and additions to its look, feel, and experience.</p>
<p>“Becoming Hollywood Casino at Greektown will offer our guests the best of both worlds: we’re keeping all of the unique, neighborhood charm that has defined Greektown since we opened our doors, while adding several new amenities that come with being a part of Penn National’s flagship brand family.” John Drake, General Manager, Hollywood Casino, Greektown</p>
<p>The Hollywood Casino will complete in the coming months the ongoing redesign of its guestrooms and suites as part of the $30 million renovation program which already saw the hotel lobby redesigned to open a lobby cocktail bar.</p>
<p>The property will be home to several new food and beverage offerings – the Urban Cocktail and Rock Bar lounges, as well as Dunkin’ concept, all located in the lobby, while currently available casual and to-go dining options at the Monroe Market food hall will be expanded with the inclusion of a new Detroit Taco Company. The casino’s premier steakhouse, Prism, will welcome its guests with a new menu.</p>
<p>Cashless Gaming and Plenty of Entertainment</p>
<p>The property will also feature some exclusive technology upgrades such as cashless gaming via the mywallet feature of the mychoice reward app which allows patrons to connect with slots and table games via their smartphones to add funds, collect winnings and earn tier points.</p>
<p>On the entertainment side, Hollywood Casino already extended its partnership with the Detroit Music Hall to cover the 2022-23 season and provide its guests with a variety of live music and comedy performances, as well as shows featuring Michael Bolton, Wanda Sykes, Boyz II Men, Jim Brewer, America, and others.</p>
<p>“Hollywood is coming to Detroit, and we’re ready to roll out the red carpet for our visitors and guests. Its Tinsel Town meets Greektown.” John Drake, General Manager, Hollywood Casino, Greektown</p>
<p>To celebrate the rebranding of the property, a red-carpet-themed private VIP event, as well as a community special event will be hosted on May 19 and May 21, respectively.</p>
<p>The events will offer all mychoice rewards program guests a chance to win luxury cruises, trips to Las Vegas, a Mercedes-Benz lease, and free slot play while the Hollywood Casino at Greektown will donate $10,000 to the Greektown Neighborhood Partnership.</p>
