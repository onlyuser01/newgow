<p>A shooting in Wisconsin at the Oneida Casino took two victims and the attacker who may have had a connection with the casino.</p>
<p>Man Shot Dead After Claiming Two Lives at Oneida Casino</p>
<p>A lone gunman in a Wisconsin opened fire at a casino property in the state on Saturday, killing two people and ending up being shot dead by police. According to Brown County Sheriff Lt. Kevin Pawlak, the shooting at the Oneida Casino in Green Bay did not appear as a random attack but was possibly premeditate.</p>
<p>“He was targeting a specific victim who was not there, but he decided to still shoot some of the victim’s friends or co-workers, it appears,” Pawlak said a quote by the Associated Press during a press conference on Sunday. The shooting happened at 7:30 pm on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said that the company was in disbelief and said that the property had strict anti-firearms measures in place. The identities of the victims and the gunman have not been released to the public.</p>
<p>Witnesses Accounts of the Shooting</p>
<p>A bystander who happened to be very close to the suspect, one Jawad Yatim, said that the gunman was shooting into the building specifically and ignored others. Pawlak said that the suspect had some sort of relationship with the employer and that may have prompted the attack.</p>
<p>One of the casino patrons, Max Westphal, said that casino staffers asked him and others to evacuate, but nobody had alerted them as to nature why. They all thought it was a minor accident and found out about the shooting only later when the shooting began.</p>
<p>In Westphal’s words, there must have been around 20 to 30 shots. Authorities responded immediately converging on the property. Commenting on the complex’s security, Hill said that security was up to par, but the company may consider tougher protocols depending on what investigators find out.</p>
<p>The Oneida Nation is one of 11 tribes that run casinos in the state through a compact negotiated with the state. The tribes have exclusive rights over gambling on their properties’ territories for which they pay taxes to the state.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2018/2019, tribal gaming in the state generated an estimated $1.3 billion in gross gaming revenue (GGR).</p>
