<p>Push Gaming, a renowned supplier and developer of unique and innovative gaming content, has further strengthened its presence in the Netherlands through a link-up with Fair Play Casino. The supplier is now bringing its full array of select and player-favorite games to Fair Play Casino’s shopping windows, including such titles as Wild Swarm, Goat Getter, and Fish ‘n’ Nudge.</p>
<p>These games are just some of the products that Push Gaming will be deploying in the local market through Fair Play Casino specifically. The supplier is keen to continue growing in the highly lucrative and promising jurisdiction which has proven to be one of the best places for regulated developers and operators to pin their banner.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has not waited for too long to explore this opportunity, as the company has also been securing astring of similar alliances across the country with the supplier providing its products to a string of noteworthy brands in the industry.</p>
<p>For its part, Fair Play Casino Business Development Manager Pascal Janshen has welcomed the chance to see the operator’s game library expanded once again, and specifically with Push Gaming’s content.</p>
<p>"We are confident that this success will be replicated on our platform and that our players will gravitate towards Push’s highly entertaining releases," Janshen explained.</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was expressed by Push Gaming Director of new Business Fiona Hickey who welcomed the opportunity to enact yet another strategic move on the part of Push Gaming in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"It’s a deal that gives us a stronger foothold in an important territory and maintains our expansion goals in regulated markets," Hickey explained. Among the previous partnerships negotiated by Push Gaming in the Netherlands are such successes as the tie-up with 711 and JACKS, both locally established brands that are now giving Push Gaming more clout in the local regulated iGaming market.</p>
<p>Push Gaming is now officially part of LeoVegas Group, which acquired the innovative studio and developer back in September.</p>
