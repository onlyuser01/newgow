    <h1>Hon Dah Casino Hotel Casino Near Me Open Penn Casino Casino West Virginia Valleyview Casino Depositw</h1>

<p>Hello, sorry if this is the wrong section. It's my first time writing here.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for reading the following story about "DepositWin Casino".</p>
<p>I don't know if you know who Roshtein is, but he's a streamer that I enjoy watching. One day, I saw a promotion for the casino he was playing at - Deposit Win Casino - with a nice welcome bonus code (100% up to €400 and 100 extra spins (€0.1/spin) 1st Deposit Bonus).</p>
<p>Well, I decided to give it a try and deposited 20 euros to get it. I used my free spins, played a little in other games, and since I was being lucky, I decided to withdraw my "little profits" of 43€. At this time, my bonus cash was untouched (22€).</p>
<p>It didn't surprise me when the financial team canceled my withdrawal and told me I needed to "wager" the same amount that I had deposited to avoid "money laundering". At this time, my "BONUS CASH" was canceled as stated on their website "Your bonus was automatically canceled due to a withdrawal request. At 21.04.2023 17:22:57".</p>
<p>After losing around 13 € while betting 25€, I tried to withdraw the remaining 30€, and once again, they canceled it, telling me that I must complete the "KYC" process. I thought to myself, "wow, KYC to get my money back and 10€." And that's where the real problem started.</p>
<p>Why would I sell my data for 30€? It's pointless. So, I decided to keep playing. I spent several hours playing Big Bass Bonanza, Dog House, and Wild West Duels but hadn't won anything substantial after wagering around 400€. However, I had a nice bonus hit at the end in Dog House that increased my wallet to around 70€.</p>
<p>I took these 70€ and started betting in Wild West at 0.20 bet. To my surprise and for the first time ever, I got an 8300x win, and my balance went from 10€ to 1650€.</p>
<p>Now it's worth completing the KYC process, isn't it? I sent all the required documents, and by the time the "Financial Team" reviewed my first 500€ withdrawal, I played around with the rest and made a total of €1,489.60 wagered, just in case I needed to do it.</p>
<p>The next day, to my surprise, my withdrawal request got cancelled, and they just deducted 1500€ from my account, leaving me with 110€ under this statement:</p>
<p>"As per our Bonus Terms and Conditions under section 2.10, the maximum withdrawal from bonuses in Welcome Package is 5 times the received bonus amount. Any balance above this amount will be forfeited when the finance department approves your withdrawal request. Bonus restrictions (maximum betting limit of 4€, forbidden games) apply until the withdrawal request has been processed, or winnings generated from the mentioned bonus are part of the players' balance."</p>
<p>Well, the bonus was already canceled, but they still applied the conditions. It seems logical. I tried to talk with the support, but they were like robots, copying and pasting the same "rule" over and over again.</p>
<p>After this, a few questions came to my mind. Why do they apply bonus policies when the bonus is canceled? Why didn't they deduct that amount from the first or second withdrawal? Why didn't they warn me about this when I requested the first withdrawal? Why did they forfeit the cash from my account when the withdrawal was not "APPROVED," as stated in their policy: "...when the finance department approves your withdrawal request..."? In that scenario, and under their "unfair policies," could I have just added €200 to withdraw €1,000? Whatever... They will always find a way to NOT pay you.</p>
<p>Finally, I requested a withdrawal for the rest (hopefully, they pay me) and proceed to close the account in that "casino." If you can try to mediate between the casino and me, that would be great. However, if you can't do it for any reason, that's okay as well.</p>
<p>I just wanted to warn the community about this: AVOID DEPOSITWIN CASINO AT ALL COSTS.</p>
<p>Have a nice day, everyone.</p>
<p>PS: I attached four images showing you the withdrawals I made, the game history after the bonus was canceled, the image with the bonus canceled, and the total amount wagered.</p>
