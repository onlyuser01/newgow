    <h1>Oldest Vegas Casino Ohio Online Casino Sac Fox Casino Powhattan Kansas Bucky S Casino Kansas Crossin</h1>

<p>Good morning Kristina, how are you, I hope you are well, yes, and the only obstacle, my identity was checked several times, once recently, my driver's license had expired, and a new check was carried out with another document with ID, everything was fine, I continued to receive my earnings normally through my card. digital pay4fun, but a month ago they excluded this withdrawal method from my account, leaving only the methods bank transfer, pix, astropay, jeton wallet, and cryptocurrencies so I decided to choose to withdraw my earnings via pix that this method already it had been verified and I had already used it a few times to withdraw my winnings. More than a while ago, there were many technical failures and in this withdrawal that I made right after they removed the pay4fun wallet, it gave a technical failure. They advised me to use the bank transfer or astropay method. I chose to use bank transfer which I had already checked and used this method a while ago for withdrawals so I created a withdrawal of R$17,900 Brl and Mr.bet casino automatically divided my withdrawal into two, one of R$14,450 Brl and the other in R$3,450 to make it easier for providers to make the payment but they gave the withdrawal of R$14,450 as a technical failure and only paid for the withdrawal of R$3,450 Brl so I chose to use the astropay wallet where I created a withdrawal and everything went fine it fell into my wallet astropay which is already verified by astropay and it reached my bank account and everything was fine, so I created a new withdrawal request through astropay, that's where they asked to verify the astropay payment method where I uploaded all types of documents that the app and the website astropay provides screenshot of astropay account details, astropay account information, astropay card with details, deposit made from astropay to Mr.bet casino, screenshot of all my transactions on astropay and also asked astropay support they gave me they sent a newsletter that they do not provide any type of document other than an astropay deposit slip for Mr.bet casino to also send to them and my screenshots were taken in the astropay app and also on the astropay website on my computer and everything was also sent to them but I'm worried because I honored all my deposits made to Mr.bet I already have a high level in the casino as president of parliament in my profile I have a high value in the casino my balance today is R$1,290,759.66 Brl I'm worried that they deleted the pay4fun wallet that my winnings were arriving correctly and through the other transfer and pix methods there are many technical failures and now that they are making it difficult for the digital wallet that I have available but I hope everything goes well, I appreciate the attention from all of you at the casino guru for helping to resolve this situation, thank you.</p>
