    <h1>Poseidon Casino 7 Clans Casino Casinos Kansas City Casino Cleveland Casino Yaamava Entain Changes Pr</h1>

<p>The decision comes less than half a year after the relaunch of Unikrn</p>
<p>Entain unveiled its plans to scale back Unikrn’s B2C operations amid notable restructuring plans. Unikrn, which was acquired by Entain two years ago, marked the gambling company’s foray into the world of esports. However, Unikrn seems to no longer align with Entain’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>After acquiring Unikrn in October 2021, Entain re-launched the esports brand in December 2022. Less than a year later, however, Entain plans to scale down Unikrn’s B2C operations, instead of expanding the brand’s global footprint.</p>
<p>According to Entain, this decision comes amid restructuring efforts that seek to improve the efficiency of the company’s business, allowing it to enact its strategy and grow. The company praised Unikrn as a leading esports betting product and teased that there would be many other opportunities to capitalize on its capabilities.</p>
<p>Entain did not provide further comment on its plans for Unikrn. However, Entain’s statement seems to suggest that the parent company does not plan to shut down the brand just yet and may still pursue opportunities in the realm of esports betting.</p>
<p>The downscale of Unikrn comes several weeks after Entain’s Australian arm unveiled substantial job cuts across several departments.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Unikrn scored a major partnership agreement with BLAST, a leading esports company, best known for its BLAST Premier Counter-Strike tournament series.</p>
<p>Entain Continues to Pursue Growth</p>
<p>Entain, meanwhile, continues to pursue growth opportunities as demonstrated by many of its most recent deals. For example, the company just completed the $100 million acquisition of Angstrom Sports, helping it to unlock significant opportunities in the lucrative US market.</p>
<p>Entain recently released a report in which it provided an update on its current trading and updated its FY 2023 guidance. In the report, the company outlined a number of measures it plans to undertake to increase shareholder value. However, the company also commented on the recent regulatory headwinds it encountered in the UK.</p>
<p>As a result of these setbacks, Entain projected slower online growth. Regardless, the company remained ambitious on growing, with Jette Nygaard-Andersen listing margin expansion, sustainable growth and the pursuit of opportunities in the US as key strategic points.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Polish brand STS secured UEFA advertising rights thanks to its recent acquisition by Entain.</p>
