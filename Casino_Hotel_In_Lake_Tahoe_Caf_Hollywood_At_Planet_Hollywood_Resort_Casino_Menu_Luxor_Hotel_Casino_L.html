<p>Drew Brees, an NFL all-time great and current ambassador of PointsBet, is featured in the first of three new advertising spots for the sportsbook’s Live Your Bet Life campaign, PointsBet announced.</p>
<p>Debuting First Ad</p>
<p>Retired New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Australian-based sports betting firm PointsBet teamed up in July, when the sportsbook announced the NFL legend would be joining as a brand ambassador. Brees will be participating in the development of original content, lead commercial campaigns, marketing and other promotional activities, PointsBet said at that time.</p>
<p>The agreement was also linked to a partnership between PointsBet and NBC Sports: Drew Brees joined the media in March and is currently serving as a studio analyst for Football Night in America and a game analyst for Notre Dame Football.</p>
<p>Showcasing our lightning-fast app and easy to use interface that is primed for the in-game betting experience, this campaign is as customer-friendly as our reputation.” Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet US</p>
<p>The new advertising spot, developed in partnership with Troika Media Group, focuses on the leadership skills of the legendary quarterback, highlighting PointsBet’s market-leading technology, in-play betting capabilities and strategic approach to gain the edge in the highly competitive sports betting space in the US.</p>
<p>Developed around Drew Brees’ personality and the “exciting features of our product,” the creative team at Troika did a great job to highlight PointsBet as the “service for everyone to Live Your Bet Life,” concluded CEO Aitken.</p>
<p>PointsBet is a clear leader in the gaming space, and the Live Your Bet Life campaign is a celebration of what differentiates our service.” Drew Brees, Brand Ambassador, PointsBet</p>
<p>“In the first ad spot, I am leading my friends on the adventure of a lifetime from the top of a mountain to a great local gathering spot,” Brees continued explaining the message behind the advertisement.</p>
<p>“We celebrate our victories together when our single-game parlay comes through, highlighting the take-it-anywhere approach and in-game betting options that our technology helps us achieve,” Brees further noted, hinting that the additional ad spots will be as entertaining as the first one.</p>
<p>Authentic and Credible Content</p>
<p>Troika Media Group, which was named PointsBet’s creative agency partner for 2021 and holds the trademark for Live Your Bet Life campaign as the brand’s market positioning partner, will leverage its expertise in the field of sports to create brand value, maximize its reach and broaden the scope of the brand’s recognition.</p>
<p>TMG’s Chairman and CEO, Robert Machinist, said that the agency would “create authentic and credible content that resonates with sports bettors,” looking to engage as with seasoned sports bettors so with novices in sports betting.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have been awarded this engagement and very excited to partner with PointsBet as they continue to enhance the modern bettor experience,” Machinist concluded.</p>
<p>As the first of the Live Your Bet Life campaign, the advertising spot will air nationally and in markets where PointsBet has active sports betting operations, while the additional commercials are scheduled to debut later this year.</p>
