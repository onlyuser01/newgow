<p>The partners are planning to expand their iLottery and sports betting offering beyond Minas Gerais in the future</p>
<p>Provider of iLottery technology and services NeoGames S.A. announced its lottery and sports betting solution is now available for Loteria Mineira, the official lottery of Brazil’s second-largest state, Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>Debuting in Brazil</p>
<p>LotoMinas, launched in partnership with Intralot do Brasil, known as Saga Business Games Intelligence, marked the first launch of the end-to-end technology-driven provider of iLottery and iGaming solutions in the Latin American country.</p>
<p>Commenting on this “truly ground-breaking launch in the Brazilian market,” NeoGames’ chief executive officer Moti Malul hailed the partnership with Intralot do Brasil, a lottery operator whose experienced team “understands the local market so well and has built a solid operation and reputation.”</p>
<p>“Together we will provide online lottery and sports betting players in Minas Gerais with a first-class online gaming experience,” Malul continued, highlighting the deal as another demonstration of how NeoGames’s recent strategic acquisitions are brought into play by capitalizing on Btobet’s sports betting solution and Aspire Global’s managed services.</p>
<p>NeoGames and Intralot do Brasil initially teamed up in June last year, agreeing on a partnership aimed at launching iLottery and sports betting solutions via Intralot’s Loteria Mineira in Brazil, and the launch of LotoMinas now marked the beginning of a multi-year turnkey project in the country.</p>
<p>Natural Fit between the Partners</p>
<p>Underscoring the “natural fit” between NeoGames and Intralot do Brasil, Sérgio Alvarenga, chief executive officer and owner of Saga Business Games Intelligence and Intralot do Brasil, hailed Neogames as “one of the industry’s most innovative iLottery providers.”</p>
<p>“We’re excited to offer our players a comprehensive digital program that will broaden and enhance the range of content and services that we offer them,” Alvarenga continued, noting that the partners are planning to expand “the new modalities of online instant games and sports betting” for new states and federal licenses, and confident that the collaboration will help the lottery advance.</p>
<p>Utilizing a local cloud-based solution on the NeoSphere platform, a suite of NeoGames Studio eInstant games tailored to the local market, a range of services provided by Aspire Global such as CRM and sports risk management, and BtoBet’s complete online sports betting solution, including Managed Trading Services, the comprehensive iLottery offering is expected to build on the state’s successful retail lottery and digital keno program.</p>
<p>Popular game titles Queen of Diamonds, Instant Keno Multiplier and VIP Platinum were among the 18 games that were made available to players at launch.</p>
<p>Outside of the Americas, NeoGames recently became a semi-premium partner for European Lotteries to help the organization’s members generate more revenue and maximize contribution to good causes.</p>
