<p>The agreement between AdmiralBet and the team has been characterized by reliability and mutual trust, HSV’s CEO said</p>
<p>Novo Interactive has extended its partnership agreement between its AdmiralBet brand and the soccer club Hamburger SV (HSV). As a result, the operator will continue serving as the team’s official partner until June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The two parties first joined forces in 2019 and have been working together since. Under the newly-extended deal, AdmiralBet’s brand will feature on HSV’s video and LED boards at its home stadium, the Volksparkstadion. In addition, HSV will promote AdmiralBet across its digital channels.</p>
<p>The operator, meanwhile, will leverage its agreement with the team to create exciting betting experiences for its customers. The company will continue hosting the beloved AdmiralBet Challenge and will feature HSV prominently.</p>
<p>In addition, HSV and AdmiralBet have thought of a new interactive tool to engage sports fans. It will be an AdmiralBet numbers game where customers can test their knowledge of Hamburger SV every matchday. The minigame will have a social element attached to it, allowing participants to compete with their friends. It will go live in the second half of the season, according to the announcement.</p>
