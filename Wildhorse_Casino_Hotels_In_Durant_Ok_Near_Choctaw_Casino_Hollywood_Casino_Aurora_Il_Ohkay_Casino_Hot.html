<p>Going to keep this brief however I wanted to share some information regarding Casino Rewards and their subsidiaries.</p>
<p>1) VIP Suspensions are triggered because you took advantage of the free bonuses on multiple accounts. We know this because all accounts you create are linked with one another.</p>
<p>2) The staff can always give out free bonuses but they rather not give them out to people who have a lifetime spend of $10.</p>
<p>3) People from canada will always have logging in issues as the parent company to Casino Rewards rushed the development of the Canadian Exclusive Casinos which are account starting with ON.</p>
<p>4) Most bonuses are pre-calculated which factors in your daily spend, lifetime spend and how many times you’ve come into the chat whilst factoring "computer generated" calculations which are BPM.</p>
<p>5) Make sure your account is in good standing otherwise your winnings can be stripped away from your account if you have any arrears and you won’t always be notified.</p>
<p>6) Most emails go unanswered for months due to the poor development of the in-house tools. Most answers are generic and will always be generic unless your a high valued customer.</p>
<p>7) We can see what bonuses you have claimed, when and how much the deposits were. If you try to use the bonuses found on forums these won’t be honoured as every bonus has a special PID which is tied to their accounts.</p>
<p>8) KYC is needed however not always asked for.</p>
<p>9) They’ve implemented a Chat-GPT based chatbot to deal with all bonus enquires, meaning that you won’t get to speak with a CS agent.</p>
<p>10) VIP Points Suspension is generally triggered due to abuse of the system i.e bonuses being activated on multiple accounts when the T&amp;Cs state that only one account can redeem the bonus.</p>
