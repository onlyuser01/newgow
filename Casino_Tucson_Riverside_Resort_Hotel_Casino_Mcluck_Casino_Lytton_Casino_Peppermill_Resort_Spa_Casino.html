    <h1>Casino Tucson Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Mcluck Casino Lytton Casino Peppermill Resort Spa Casino</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I started playing online casinos roughly two and a half years ago. Punt was the first casino that I was introduced to that provided "instant withdraw." Meaning they payout your winnings within a reasonable timeframe, which usually took 15-20 minutes. In addition, I truly loved all the slot games Punt had to offer.</p>
<p>But... soon after, they changed their "instant withdraw" payout method to "3 to 4 business days. To clarify, this is crypto currency I'm referring to. Once they changed their payout method, I played with them a couple of times and won once. I requested a payout of $260.00 US dollars. I waited 3 days. No winnings were deposited. So I waited a couple more days. No winnings were deposited. I contacted live support. They said my winnings were still on the Blockchain and to hang tight, my winnings should be deposited very soon. After a week, I reached out, and still, my winnings were still on the Blockchain. Long story short, I much have emailed them and contacted live support dozens and dozens of times over the next two months. Finally, one of the live customer support reps told me that my winnings had been sent to my crypto address a while back ago. I asked him to verify what crypto address it went to, and he actually showed me the crypto address. It wasn't mine. I was absolutely furious. After all those weeks, really! I mean, they could have shown me that a long time ago. At that time, I was new to online gaming, so it was probably my fault. But for Punt to keep me in the dark like that, it's just not right to their paying customers.</p>
<p>So, after two years of staying away from Punt Casino because of that incident, I decided to make a clean deposit with them, once again. I had read on their site that they went back to "instant withdraws." So I figured I'd give it a try, especially because of the instant withdraw.</p>
<p>I made my deposit on 01/24/2024. I won and ultimately decided to cashout at $121.00. I was expecting to see my winnings in my crypto wallet within the hour because it clearly states "instant deposits" and "instant withdraws."</p>
<p>It's now 01/26/2024 6:45PM PST, and I've emailed them and tried contacting live support. No one from Punt will answer me. I finally got ahold of someone, finally. She said Punt is within the timeframe and to wait, my winnings will be deposited very soon. I asked her over and over why the long wait if Punt clearly states that they are instant withdraw, She said Punt isn't instant withdraw. I proceeded to explain that yes it does say instant withdraw and exactly where I saw that posted.</p>
<p>My problem is: I would have NEVER deposited with them if I had to wait this long. I play to win and then I want to cashout. Plain and simple. I feel I was deceived into depositing with them, and that's not right to do to people. Especially, when they need their winnings immediately.</p>
