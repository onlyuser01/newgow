<p>The holiday festivities have not stopped Stakelogic from announcing another major partnership close to the year’s end. This time around, the supplier of bespoke and mass-market games has teamed up with BetShop in Greece, touted as one of the top five brands in the country, CasinoGuru learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>As a result, Stakelogic will provide its library of classic and video slot games to the local operator and help both consolidate their footprint in the market. Greece, which has been more open to suppliers and online gaming in recent months, has attracted serious interest from cutting-edge developers across the board.</p>
<p>As to Stakelogic, the supplier will be delivering titles such as Runner 8 Runner, Mega Runner, Super Bonus Wild, and Super 6 Timer. Stakelogic is also adding some of its best video slots that stand out with their gameplay and mechanics, including Wild Buzz, Origins, Cash Express, and El Cowboy Megaways.</p>
<p>The games that Stakelogic brings to bear in the Greek market and with BetShop feature both traditional and innovative features. Among them is the Super Stake mechanic which is the supplier’s own signature style. Through this mechanic, players have a chance to double their bet and get better bonuses for excellent win options that scale with each spin.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, Stakelogic Sales Manager Neil Tanti hailed BetShop’s place in the Greek market and described the brand as a leader. Tanti also said that Stakelogic’s games have been built in such a way as to excite and captivate players with the added benefit of a big-win potential, and concluded:</p>
<p>"We see Greece as having tremendous potential for our games, and what better way to build on our position in the market than by going live with such a prestigious operator."</p>
<p>BetShop Chief Product Offices Massimiliano Cerfoglia was similarly pleased with the news. He welcomed Stakelogic as a supplier that hardly needed any introduction, to begin with, and one that would significantly increase the brand’s offer when it comes to classic and video slots.</p>
<p>Cerfoglia described the latest partnership as a significant step forward for the company that would enable it to establish itself as a market leader. As to Stakelogic itself, the company has been definitely pushing across a number of markets in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix inked a partnership with the company’s live casino development arm, and bet365 signed a content alliance with Stakelogic to maintain its momentum in the Dutch iGaming market. As to the supplier’s efforts in another important market across Europe, Stakelogic launched with Videoslots in Italy.</p>
