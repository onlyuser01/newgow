    <h1>Sweepstake Casinos Casino Yuma Az Sac Fox Casino Oceans Eleven Casino 12 Tribes Resort Casino Rocket</h1>

<p>I am forever grateful for CASINO GURU. I love the transparency which is the cornerstone of integrity for me.</p>
<p>It's why I give more trust in your reviews than say askgamblers.</p>
<p>Yes casinos are your paymasters but there is a strong market niche for integrity. Just look at the US POLITICAL SPHERE... There is no doubt now that the CIA, FBI, Corporations, Judges, media etc all collude against the people...</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am seeing the same thing with online gambling casinos: corruption right across the board bar a few like Casino GURU and WINZ Casino etc.</p>
<p>From the casinos to the "reviewers" both affiliates and players reviews to the software companies, to the software auditors such as ECOGRA and the licensing authorities like CURACO.</p>
<p>Playing at Rocket Play and seeing the rigging of software before my eyes really brought home how widespread the corruption may be... be it online or real casino.</p>
<p>I wanted to post it all here immediately when I had all the damning evidence but had other priorities so I gave up.</p>
<p>I made 2 visits 2 deposits same amount and got a friend to sign up and deposited on another occassion. I had 30 screenshots from the 3 occassions.</p>
<p>Non live Roulette game in question we played were offered by many other casinos such as skycrown.</p>
<p>When the casino catches on to a winning formula where I was betting ($400) more than my deposit ($365) in a round, and it's a WIN, the bet amount is returned, but no profit is paid. Second 3rd time it happened I quickly snapshotted bet history and replays of the game knowing that the casino will scrub it out.</p>
<p>1st time they gave me a payback bonus of $42.</p>
<p>2nd 3rd time when I mentioned why there was NO PAYBACK BONUS for my deposit last week, they said I never deposited and showed my history. The deposit and all my game nets were wiped!</p>
<p>I then showed them some snapshots. They went silent.</p>
<p>I have deposited there since and have withdrawn $1000 on pokies after a few days verification delays but no issue.</p>
<p>This means that the software house allows the casino access to do do this editing!</p>
<p>This means that auditors etc like ECOGRA are not doing there job, incompetent or turning a blind eye!</p>
<p>At RICH CASINO had so many issues! I was up thousands from a $50 deposit. Betting $2 a spin I saw by balance decrease by $100 per spin?! I showed support with my screenshots... They have me back a few hundred but said must a been a glitch to give them a way out.</p>
<p>When it came time to withdraw they have me hell till I said I was gonna post it all on askgamblers and casino guru... And apologised and I pretensiously said it was cool...</p>
