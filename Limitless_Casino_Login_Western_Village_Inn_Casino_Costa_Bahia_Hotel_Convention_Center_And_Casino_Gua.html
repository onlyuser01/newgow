<p>The popular crypto sportsbook and casino website has used its in-house data to see what Bitcoin bettors’ attitudes are for the upcoming Wimbledon</p>
<p>Cloudbet has taken a closer look at who the most backed bettors using Bitcoin currency are naming Veronika Kudermetova and Daniil Medvedev. The company said that Kudermetova has collected 29% of all new bets placed on Cloudbet with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Cloudbet Looks into Bitcoin Betting Volumes for Wimbledon</p>
<p>As to Medvedev, he galvanized 20% of all new Bitcoin bettors to top the Men’s title at Wimbledon. Another prominent player Carlos Alcaraz took 29% of the new bets. Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic remain the bookmaker’s favorites based on the betting volume going in and the company’s own trading team.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest data release a Cloudbet spokesperson confirmed that the favorites were out there and well-known. However, they suggested that there is room to back one of the underdogs and get a much better value overall.</p>
<p>It’s clear who the favorites are, but if you’re betting on Wimbledon, you want to maximize your profits by backing an underdog or two. The search for value is on and that’s why we’re seeing some of these interesting moves in the market. Cloudbet</p>
<p>Although Kudermetova is mostly touted as an outsider and not an outright favorite, she has had a good year, placing it in a good position to upset oddsmakers and yield some interesting results for bettors.</p>
<p>Good Value to Be Had on the Underdogs</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is Medvedev who won both the Italian Open and Miami Open and is presently very good value for the money. Cloudbet has been habitually offering insights into important sporting events.</p>
<p>The bookmaker has been known to also offer exclusive odds boosters for events such as the Ultimate Fighting Champions, UEFA Championship League, and others. Cloudbet has been actively developing across several verticals, including esports, sports, and casinos, and leveraging cryptocurrencies as its main and most popular type of payment on the platform.</p>
<p>Cloudbet has also been keeping track of the odds of former President Donald Trump being reelected for office once again in the upcoming elections.</p>
