<p>The expert announced his plans to step down from the senior vice president of business-to-business partnerships role at Spotlight Sports Group at the end of 2023</p>
<p>The world-leading technology, content, media and solutions provider that focuses on the sports betting and fantasy sports vertical, Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), announced an upcoming change to its C-suite. On Tuesday, the company confirmed that its SVP of business-to-business (B2B) partnerships, Rick Wolf, has taken the decision to retire. His retirement would be effective as of the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, SSG confirmed that Wolf will continue to collaborate with companies within the betting and fantasy sports sectors in the role of advisor. Moreover, he will also continue to hold the position of Board Member with the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), delivering strategic guidance and extensive knowledge.</p>
<p>Before SSG, Wolf held different senior roles with CBS Sports, NBC Sports, as well as FSGA. Throughout his extensive career, he was able to create long-lasting B2B relationships, while at the same time accumulating significant knowledge and unique skills. Overall, Wolf is recognized for his expertise and unique experience that was accumulated through years of hard work and dedication to the sports betting and fantasy sports verticals.</p>
<p>Commenting on his retirement, SSG’s outgoing SVP of B2B partnerships revealed that he dedicated his entire career to fantasy sports and the sports betting industries. “It is my life’s work and I will always be a part of this industry,” he added. Finally, Wolf said that it was an honor for him to propel the growth of fantasy sports across the US while overseeing the expansion of SSG in the country.</p>
<p>“It was my honor to help grow fantasy sports interest before its popularity became widespread and to help the great people at SSG grow during the explosion of the US sports betting market in the last few years.“ Rick Wolf, SVP of B2B partnerships at SSG</p>
<p>Wolf Joined Spotlight Back in 2021</p>
<p>Sam Houlding, SSG’s chief commercial officer, praised the efforts of the outgoing SVP of B2B partnerships. He explained that Wolf was an important part of the company’s C-suite. Finally, Houlding said: “His unmatchable knowledge and expertise within the sports betting and fantasy sports landscape allowed us to further scale our B2B efforts and build a brand awareness of SSG in the US that would not have been possible without him.”</p>
<p>It was back in 2021 when Wolf joined SSG. This happened after SSG acquired The Alarm Sports Network, a company where he served as the president for the last 10 years. Joining SSG, Wolf played a key role for the B2B expansion of the company across the United States. Thanks to his strategic guidance, SSG became a leading provider of solutions and technology, powering betting and fantasy operators in the country.</p>
