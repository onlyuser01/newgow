<p>At the beginning of the year, Zitro announced the launch of its critically-acclaimed 88 Link games with KirolBet in Spain’s city of Boiro. Now, the slot game provider based in Luxemburg announced a similar deal with Atlantic City Casino in Lima, Peru. The agreement will help Zitro strengthen its presence in the LatAm region, with special emphasis on the Peru market that the company already entered via Chiclayo’s Palacio Royal Casino this spring.</p>
<p>Zitro’s Games Will Appeal to Tourists in the Miraflores District</p>
<p>Atlantic City Casino is located in Miraflores, an affluent district in Lima known for being an important destination for tourists. Atlantic City Casino’s chief operating officer Victor Cardoso expressed the company’s excitement to enter the “long-lasting business relationship” with “such a strong partner”. Cardoso also explained the company was eager to see how its players would respond to the fresh additions. He suggested that even more titles could be introduced to the gaming market in Lima in the upcoming future, thanks to the new collaboration that is paving the way for fresh slots.</p>
<p>For the moment, the new deal only includes two multi-game themes, Wild Duels, and Lucky Charms. The games count five reels and 243-ways-to-win each, along with a mystery jackpot with five different levels that can be engaged by the Allure feature.</p>
<p>The New Deal, an Added Catalyst to Nitro’s Growth</p>
<p>Nitro’s regional director for LatAm Alejandra Burato commended the company was “convinced that these top-performing game titles” would meet the versatile preferences of the casino’s players. She also called the partnership an “added catalyst” for the company’s ongoing development in Peru.</p>
<p>Burato called it “a pleasure” to work together with Atlantic City Casino and bring their “proven performance games” to the iconic venue. She also expressed her confidence in Nitro’s games and their ability to boost profits and player engagement, while mentioning the “enormous benefits” of the new deal for both parties.</p>
<p>Zitro was founded in 2007 and gradually turned into a leading creator of entertainment that provides video slot and bingo titles, online gaming, and systems. The company works with over 300 professionals busy with maintaining the company’s focus on development, research, and innovation. The freshest creations are made in the Barcelona Idea Factory, helping Zitro continue its path as a global leader in the video bingo industry. The company also plans on further expanding in the field of video slots using excellence and differentiation.</p>
