<p>After beating the Miami Heat in the Play-In Tournament, the Atlanta Hawks are coming to Massachusetts to try and do the same against the Boston Celtics. The first game of the Celtics vs. Hawks Playoff series is on the program on Saturday, April 15</p>
<p>The Boston Celtics destroyed the Atlanta Hawks in each of their last five duels, so it’s only logical to assume they’re going to do the same on Saturday, April 15. However, the Hawks are coming off a win over the Miami Heat in the Play-Ins, in which they were +179 underdogs before the match. Maybe they can upset the odds once again?</p>

<p>Atlanta Hawks Have Bad Memories from Duels with Boston Celtics</p>
<p>The Hawks lost each of their last five duels with the Celtics. When it comes to their trips to Boston, they’re 1-8 in the last 10 games at TD Garden.</p>
<p>Actually, they’ve been pretty poor on the road against most rivals. Their away record in the regular season was 17-24 (.415). If it weren’t for their good performances at home, they wouldn’t have finished in the No. 8 position and got themselves to the postseason.</p>
<p>In the Plan-In Tournament, however, they pulled off a great upset on the road. They defeated the Miami Heat in Florida, with the final score of 123-105. It was a brilliant team effort with nine different Atlanta players scoring points. Tray Young scored the most (25 pts), while another six players put away double figures. Two players scored under 10, but one of them – Clint Capela recorded 21 rebounds.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics’ Key Men Doubtful for Saturday’s Clash</p>
<p>Jalen Brown and Jayson Tatum are both listed as doubtful for Saturday’s game. These two are Boston’s key players, and without them, the Celtics are bound to struggle. The good news is that the NBA Playoffs are best-of-seven series, meaning that even if they lose on Saturday, it wouldn’t be a catastrophe.</p>
<p>But they sure don’t want to lose on Saturday, especially because they’re playing on their turf. With the help of their fans, the Celtics have been brilliant at TD Garden in the 2022-23 season. In the regular season, they went 32-9 (.780), which is the joint-best record (shared with the Milwaukee Bucks) in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Hawks vs. Celtics Prediction</p>
<p>The Hawks have the momentum on their side, but we doubt that will mean much. Sure, they might put on a good show on Saturday, but we honestly doubt they can beat the Celtics at TD Garden.</p>
<p>Pick: Boston Celtics to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
