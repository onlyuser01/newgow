<p>Two suspects were apprehended this week after an attempted abduction in the parking lot of West Virginiaâ€™s Wheeling Island Casino. The victims were held at gunpoint.</p>

<p>The suspects initially broke into a parked car at the gaming property on Tuesday evening, police said. They then allegedly tried to kidnap a woman from the vehicle. The suspects later aimed a gun at the woman and a second victim outside of the car, Wheeling police said.</p>
<p>The victims both were able to flee and neither was injured.</p>
<p>The suspects, identified as Duwan Malik Groover, 43, and Susan Irene Coryell, 37, both of Wheeling, were later apprehended by police, according to WTRF, a local TV station.</p>
<p>Groover is charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of first-degree sexual assault, and a single count of attempted abduction. Coryell is charged with two counts of accessory before the fact of robbery.</p>
<p>Both suspects were booked at the Northern Regional Jail. During a court appearance later in the week, a magistrate set bail at $300K for Groover and $50K for Coryell. The duo was also linked to the assault of a woman and man in an East Wheeling residence, also on Tuesday evening, police said.</p>
<p>More charges could be brought against the two suspects, WTRF said. The details of the sexual assault charge against Groover remain unclear as of this writing.</p>
