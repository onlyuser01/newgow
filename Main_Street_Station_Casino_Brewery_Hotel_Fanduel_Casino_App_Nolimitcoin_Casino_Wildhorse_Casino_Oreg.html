<p>Dear VEMar,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the promotional offers on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"There's nothing I like more than playing with all my toys. The second thing I like the most are the gift cookies and I would love to give you some to say Welcome to Will's Casino! But I know I can't, so I found a way to give you a welcome gift: € 350 + 100 free spins to start sniffing out all the options I have for you.</p>
<p>First deposit you receive 100% up to €200 + 50 Free spins</p>
<p>Second deposit you receive 50% up to €150 + 50 Free spins</p>
<p>Code 100%: WILL1</p>
<p>Code 50%: WILL2</p>
<p>Bonus conditions:</p>
<p>Minimum deposit 25 EUR | 25USD | 30 CAD | 250 NOK.</p>
<p>Expires 15 days after being activated.</p>
<p>It has a requirement of 20X (D+B) for match 100% and 30X for match 50%.</p>
<p>Table games are excluded.</p>
<p>Live casino has no contribution.</p>
<p>Free spins in The Dog House | Pragmatic Play."</p>
<p>However, in the general bonus terms, there's written that free bonuses are not available for players registering from Greece (please see below):</p>
<p>"Bonuses without deposit</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bonuses are not available to players registering accounts from the following countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Mauritius, Poland, Romania, Russia, The Netherlands, Ukraine."</p>
<p>That would explain why you received your match bonus but not the Free Spins. Please understand that due to your geolocation you are not entitled to obtain free offers and even if Free Spins were part of the Deposit bonus, they are extra and not received automatically.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
