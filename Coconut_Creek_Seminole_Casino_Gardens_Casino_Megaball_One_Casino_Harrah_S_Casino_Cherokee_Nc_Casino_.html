<p>3 Oaks Gaming, a casino games and marketing tools startup, has expanded its overall market presence via a new deal with Technamin, an iGaming platform provider. Under the agreement, the former company will supply the latter with a rich suite of premium slot games.</p>

<p>Thanks to the agreement, Technamin will be able to offer many more new games to its partnering operators. Clients of the platform supplier will be able to enhance their content offerings with fan-favorite titles including Big Heist, Sticky Piggy and The King of Heroes.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming, on the other hand, will have new opportunities to reach more end customers all over the world. Through Technamin and its partners, the provider’s titles will reach many new operators across different markets. 3 Oaks is famed for its immersive and high-quality slots and there is little doubt that a lot of new players will fall in love with the brand.</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming has been steadily expanding its reach through strategic deals with various companies. The company recently inked key deals with major operators and distributors, greatly bolstering its global footprint.</p>
<p>A Lot of Opportunities for 3 Oaks</p>
<p>Sebastian Damian, 3 Oaks Gaming’s managing director, spoke about the new agreement. He said that the deal with Technamin is a great opportunity for his company. He noted that seeing the 3 Oaks’ content go live on the platform provider’s platform attests to the hard work put in by 3 Oaks Gaming.</p>
<p>Damian concluded that key partnerships such as this one will put 3 Oaks Gaming on the map, helping it make even greater strides toward becoming a major force in the sector.</p>
<p>Suren Khachatryan, Technamin’s founder and chief executive officer, added that his company’s platform would gladly adopt games as good as 3 Oaks’. Khachatryan said that his team is delighted by the integration and looking forward to seeing how the players react to 3 Oaks’ titles.</p>
<p>The selection of slots available on our platform is now stronger than ever, and we can’t wait to see how players respond to this latest addition of titles. Suren Khachatryan, CEO, Technamin</p>
<p>3 Oaks Gaming was founded in 2021 but is already cementing itself as one of the fastest-growing distributors of iGaming content and marketing tools. The company has been inking major deals left and right, launching in many regulated jurisdictions with various local powerhouses.</p>
<p>In October, for example, the company was certified by Bulgaria’s National Revenue Agency, allowing it to launch in the country. A few days later, it also launched in Ukraine with Slots City, a famous local operator. At the end of the month, the company secured an entry to Italy, one of Europe’s most lucrative gaming markets.</p>
<p>In November, the ambitious distributor also minted deals with Hub88 and EveryMatrix.</p>
