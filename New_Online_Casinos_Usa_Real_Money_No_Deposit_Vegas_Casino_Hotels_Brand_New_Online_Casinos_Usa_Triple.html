<p>Michigan rolls out updated COVID-19 health and safety rules for employers. Casino patrons must mandatory wear masks and each operator must conduct screening upon entry.</p>
<p>Michigan government and health officials revealed new rules for employers aiming at ensuring a safe work process in the COVID-19 environment. The new rules were signed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer and COVID-19 Workplace Safety Director Sean Egan on Wednesday, October 14.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, the new rules will remain in place for 90 days. The announcement of the new safety rules comes just days after the Michigan Supreme Court deemed the Governor’s executive orders as invalid. The rules which employers need to follow have seen support by multiple business associations. Furthermore, the updated COVID-19 health and safety rules are quite similar to the safety guidelines which were introduced by Governor Whitmer previously.</p>
<p>Bars, restaurants, gyms, and casino employers will need to follow the new rules to ensure safe operations. In casinos, guests must wear a mask mandatory. Only exceptions are made when patrons are eating, drinking, or partially removing their mask for identification by casino security. Furthermore, casino operators will need to place informative signs outlining that masks are mandatory. Each casino guest will also have to undergo screening which includes a temperature check and COVID-19 questionnaire.</p>
<p>The Governor Vowed to Continue Working for the Protection of Businesses and Workers</p>
<p>In a statement, Governor Whitmer commented about the new COVID-19 rules outlining that they were introduced to bring clarity to employers regarding the necessary requirement to keep their workplaces, employees, and guests healthy. The Governor did acknowledge that most employers in Michigan are already following the rules to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I will continue to work around the clock with my partners in labor and business to ensure protections for every Michigan worker,” Governor Gretchen Whitmer</p>
<p>Under the new rules, employers will also need to create a workplace COVID-19 plan which outlines the health and safety guidelines which must be followed. Besides screening the guests, employees will also undergo questionnaire screening. On the other hand, temperature screening is currently a recommendation.</p>
<p>Any sick employees will be asked to stay home. Employers will need to track the screening process of all employees. This requirement is in place as such information would be necessary for contract tracing. Moreover, employers will also need to provide their employees with personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, etc. Employees who cannot keep a distance of 6 feet from each other will be required to wear a mask.</p>
