    <h1>Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino The Big M Casino Photos Kiowa Casino Jobs At Station Casinos Casino</h1>

<p>Online casino platform provider SkillOnNet announced today it entered into a market access deal with Caesars Entertainment and is set for its greatly anticipated US debut in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Long-Awaited US Debut</p>
<p>The deal between the US casino giant and the platform provider behind some of the biggest online casino brands globally, will see SkillOnNet’s PlayOJO brand launched on its proprietary software, pending regulatory approval in the Garden State.</p>
<p>“This is a milestone opportunity for SkillOnNet. We have seen the immense growth in New Jersey and very successful iGaming launches in other US states.” Maor Nutkevitch, Head, Corporate Development, SkillOnNet</p>
<p>The upcoming launch will allow players in New Jersey to experience first-hand the fully transparent and fair market approach adopted by the iGaming software supplier, which is behind its success in the main European markets where the PlayOJO brand became quite popular among players.</p>
<p>“PlayOJO offers an unrivalled gaming experience with a huge game portfolio and focus on safe and fair gambling. We are confident that launching this casino focused challenger brand at this stage of the market evolution, will allow us to build a meaningful market share within few years of operation.” Maor Nutkevitch, Head, Corporate Development, SkillOnNet</p>
<p>The New Jersey debut is just the first step of SkillOnNet’s ambitious plan to establish a presence across regulated markets in the US, as the company is planning on strong local HQ operation built on marketing campaigns, product development and technology teams.</p>
<p>Further US Expansion via Similar Market Access Deals</p>
<p>SkillOnNet said in the official press release it is also planning to secure similar market access partnerships for other states, relying on its online casino brand with an innovative platform tailored to attract casual players. The platform provider will also target deals in the iGaming and media space.</p>
<p>In February, the PlayOJO brand was among SkillOnNet’s popular online casinos which received a boost from the content deal the platform provider signed with 1X2 Network to allow players at its brands access to games from the 1X2gaming and Iron Dog Studio subsidiaries of the slot and table games developer.</p>
<p>The deal also allowed SkillOnNet to launch 1X2gaming’s player-favorite titles such as Rainbow Wilds, Blood Queen, Battle Maidens Cleopatra, 1Million Megaways BC, as well as Pirate Kingdom Megaways and Viking Wilds, across its Turbonino, Slingo, Lord Ping, and Play Toro online casino brands.</p>
