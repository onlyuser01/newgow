<p>New York has already seen retail sports betting at its upstate casinos. However, online wagering is yet to be legalized. Some residents have moved to Connecticut and New Jersey to access their sportsbooks. That could be changing sooner than previously expected.</p>
<p>New York Moves Closer to Online Sports Betting</p>
<p>New York has completed another item on its online gambling to-do list. It is keeping hope alive that legalized mobile betting will begin in the state by Super Bowl. The New York State Register published a notice of the adoption mobile sports betting rules on Wednesday. The Register is an official and weekly update of regulatory activity.</p>
<p>New York law requires this step, but it is also required as the state marches toward the official launch of online sports betting.</p>
<p>This amendment and the addition of regulations will allow the New York State Gaming Commission to “to prescribe the rules for mobile sports wagering through servers located at casinos and improve sports wagering regulation at casinos,” given recent changes to gambling laws, according to the notice.</p>
<p>New York casinos in the upstate are already offering retail sports betting. Online betting has not yet been legalized in New York, which leads some New York residents to travel to Connecticut and New Jersey to find sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Slow Race Toward the Finish Line</p>
<p>New York legislators started online sports betting by passing budget-related legislation in April. It required the gaming commission (the gaming commission) to issue licenses for at least two mobile platforms that offer sports betting and would host at most four sportsbooks.</p>
<p>At its November 8 meeting, the commission approved 10-year licensing for two groups whose sports betting revenue would be subjected to a 51% tax rate. This is the highest tax rate in the country. The first group comprises Bally Bet, BetMGM, DraftKings and FanDuel. The other includes Caesars Sportsbook WynnBET, PointsBet and Rush Street Interactive.</p>
<p>During the meeting, commissioners were informed that the recommended bidders would only be licensed conditionally if the regulators adopted the rules for mobile gambling.</p>
<p>New York’s preferred sportsbook platforms must meet several technical and regulatory requirements before being allowed to go live in the state. They include finding a state casino to host their server, finding an independent lab to approve and test their geolocation software, as well as paying their $25-million licensing fee.</p>
<p>One rule didn’t sit well with operators. An online sportsbook operator must submit for approval all promotions at least 15 days prior to being launched. DraftKings suggested that promotions only be submitted for new promos. Regulators rejected the request. Explains the notice, “The Commission disagrees, as requiring all promotions to be submitted enhances regulatory control and best protects consumers.”</p>
