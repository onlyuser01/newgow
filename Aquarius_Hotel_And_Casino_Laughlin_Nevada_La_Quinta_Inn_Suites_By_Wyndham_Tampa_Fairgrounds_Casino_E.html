<p>Pragmatic Play continues to build up its footprint in the iGaming space while putting the focus on geographical reach. The company has as a result decided to consolidate its presence in the Romanian gaming market through a fresh partnership extension with Maxbet.ro.</p>
<p>The pair have agreed to expand the current reach of their content partnership which will now feature live casino products by Pragmatic Play. Pragmatic has entered the live casino segment several years ago and has been actively building up its product offering, competing with established companies in the sector.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is already present in Romania and on Maxbet.ro through its extensive selection of slots that players have had the pleasure of enjoying on their time.</p>
<p>Moving forward, though, Pragmatic Play’ will offer its live Blackjack and Baccarat games, but also buck the trend and add the Mega Wheelgame show live casino experience to the list of available titles.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s commercial footprint has been growing at a good clip over the past months with the company signing up a string of similar partnerships in Romania as one of its key markets. Meanwhile, Pragmatic’s own efforts to bolster its portfolio have increased significantly, with the company going beyond the traditional iGaming selection and ambitiously entering the live casino segment.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely said that the company was pleased to be teaming up with Maxbet.ro and further establish its presence in the Romanian market. Live casino has become one of the leading segments anywhere in the world and gamers are actively seeking it.</p>
<p>"Our award-winning Live Casino portfolio represents an exceptionally strong proposition and we are excited to see how Maxbet.ro’s players, that currently enjoy our slots, engage with our live solution," Barzely added.</p>
<p>Maxbet.ro CEO Victor Rusinov similarly welcomed the opportunity to be expanding the operator’s portfolio with the latest additions by Pragmatic Play. Rusinov paid particular attention to the Mega Wheel experience which will help Maxbet.ro remain in pole position on the Romanian market.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s latest forays in the bingo and live casino space have been appreciated by partner casino companies looking to build upon their product variety and offer. Pragmatic similarly has big expansion plans for 2022.</p>
<p>To make sure that these plans are enacted, the company hired a new chief operating officer in the face of Irina Cornides who will help the company achieve the pre-set goals and objectives for the year.</p>
