<p>The world-class racing club providing horse racing, sports and betting entertainment, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, announced an executive-level appointment earlier this week. The Club revealed Tuesday it selected Dennis Hau for the position of Executive Director, Customer Strategy, Insights and Innovation (EDCSII).</p>
<p>Joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club in his new position, Hau will spearhead its efforts related to transformation and growth. One of his primary focuses will be customer satisfaction but he will also oversee strategies that help elevate the experience for the Club's clients.</p>
<p>In his new Executive Director role, Hau will be in charge of developing customer experience standards and implementing improvements that boost "the customer journey and the delivery of customer care across all businesses, segments and channels," a statement released by the Hong Kong Jockey Club reveals.</p>
<p>Hiring Hau doesn't come as a surprise considering his extensive experience in countries from Southeast Asia. He has a track record as a proven expert within the business development vertical.</p>
<p>What's more, Hau has accumulated invaluable knowledge in product and portfolio management as a part of leading businesses in Asia. Currently, he holds a Bachelor of Science and Business Computing from the Canada's University of Winnipeg. Additionally, he has an Executive MBA from HKUST-Kellogg.</p>
<p>Before joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club Hau was a part of Tencent Music Entertainment Limited. During his tenure with the company, he held the position of Group Vice President. At that time, he was in charge of multiple mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, Hau helped set up the International Business Group and Tencent International Product Centre.</p>
<p>Besides Tencent, he was also a part of the leading American multinational computer technology corporation, Oracle Corporation. As a part of Oracle, he was in charge of the company's product development, business intelligence, as well as data analysis for Mainland, Hong Kong, as well as the United States.</p>
<p>Although the appointment was announced this week, the Club explained that it is effective from January 11, 2023. In his new position with the company, Hau will be reporting directly to Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, the Club's Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>As a world-class racing club with a rich history, the Hong Kong Jockey Club offers unique experiences and entertainment for its members. Each year, the Club helps generate economic stimulus while at the same time helping in the fight against illegal gambling activities.</p>
