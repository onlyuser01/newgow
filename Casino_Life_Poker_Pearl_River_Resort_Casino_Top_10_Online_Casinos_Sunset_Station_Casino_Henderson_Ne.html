<p>The deal with the provider will help Betfred engage players in the United Kingdom where esports betting is very popular</p>
<p>PandaScore, a French provider of esports data and odds, has penned a new partnership agreement with the global betting operator Betfred. Per the deal between the two companies, the latter will bolster its esports betting product by integrating the supplier’s full esports betting portfolio.</p>
<p>PandaScore’s product offering currently includes 308 unique esports betting markets and more than 32,000 competitive events a year. The supplier, furthermore, boasts an average year-on-year turnover increase of 33% for operators.</p>
<p>PandaScore is fully committed to growing esports and the esports betting vertical while driving innovation in the sector. The company is backed by an experienced and professional trading team and is further powered by extensive player props markets, customer engagement widgets and an esports-oriented BetBuilder solution.</p>
<p>The provider’s BetBuilder product is the richest of its kind in the entire esports betting industry, the company claims.</p>
<p>The partnership between PandaScore and Betfred is set to launch later in 2023. It will help Betfred expands its esports betting portfolio and attract more esports punters in the United Kingdom. Betfred is a leading operator that has a strong presence in the United Kingdom’s retail and online sectors.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Help Betfred Engage UK Players</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies addressed the new agreement. According to Dasha Kirilishina. PandaScore’s senior sales manager, the provider is thrilled by the opportunity to work with Betfred and help it grow its esports product.</p>
<p>Kirilishina added that her team cannot work to launch its products with Betfred and deliver richer experiences for the players and strong and sustainable growth for the operator. She noted that her team is fully committed to helping Betfred engage esports aficionados.</p>
<p>At PandaScore, the real work begins after the client has signed, as we focus on the success of our partners and our customer success team works tirelessly to guarantee that. Dasha Kirilishina, senior sales manager, PandaScore</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Craig Reid, Betfred’s trading director, said that his team is just as excited to work with PandaScore and incorporate its products into the Betfred platform. He is certain that this agreement will help his team attract a wider audience in the UK where esports is a very popular wagering vertical.</p>
<p>There’s a strong appetite for esports betting in the UK, so it made sense to partner with a data and odds supplier like PandaScore to give our customers more of what they love. Craig Reid, trading director, Betfred</p>
<p>Speaking of Betfred, the wagering company recently launched a new IGT-powered sportsbook in the US state of Nevada.</p>
