    <h1>Tuscany Suites Casinos Las Vegas Nv Casino Online Gratis Avi Resort Casino San Juan Marriott Resort</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm new and just posting this here :)</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal from cocoa casino on 11/19/23 after winning €100 with free spins.</p>
<p>In order to initiate a withdrawal a deposit was required which I made and the withdrawal was "initiated"</p>
<p>The next day, November 20th. I had a cashback on my deposit, asked in the chat whether the cashback had a limit (answer: no), won around €150 and requested a second payout of €130.</p>
<p>A few days went by and nothing happened, so I asked the live chat, which told me to submit this and that document documents@cocoacasino.com (I hope that's right, but I still have the email.) send what I did. After a few days with no response, I asked again in the chat and was then told I had to send in the documents support@cocoacasino.com send, which I did in turn. After another few days with no response, I asked again in the chat, the lady told me she would contact the finance department and let me know the following day, which she did.</p>
<p>"Hey Philip,</p>
<p>I have received a reply from the finance department. They have checked your documents and they are now verified.</p>
<p>I have looked at your profile and have seen that you have requested your payout on November 19th. According to our terms and conditions the processing takes between 14-18 days before the process is completed.</p>
<p>best regards</p>
<p>Your customer service team</p>
<p>Cocoa Casino, cocoacasino.com"</p>
<p>This news came on December 1st. and right now, as I write this post, I see that the first payout since today, December 4th. is now listed as "pending" and no longer as "in process" and is no longer marked as reversible. I'm curious whether the second payment will be listed as outstanding tomorrow and whether the money will actually arrive.</p>
<p>I would definitely play in the casino more often if I can be sure that you will pay out if you win.</p>
