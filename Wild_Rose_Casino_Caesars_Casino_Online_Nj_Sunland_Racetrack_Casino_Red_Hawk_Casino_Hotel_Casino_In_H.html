    <h1>Wild Rose Casino Caesars Casino Online Nj Sunland Racetrack Casino Red Hawk Casino Hotel Casino In H</h1>

<p>The casino is this https://www.magicwin.bet/ and the account is still active. The casino does not have an option to self-exclude. In the safe game option, it says to contact the chat, and when you contact the chat they send you to the VIP agent who does not answer the emails. I go back to the chat to say that I have been waiting for a response for a month and they keep telling me that it has to be the VIP agent's email.</p>
<p>There are screenshots of the chat. What I do not understand is that the licensing entity allows them to act like this.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that they have changed the responsible gaming section. on Sunday it wasn't like that, I also have a screenshot of that sent to the chat, since it said that to self-exclude myself I would contact the chat.</p>
<p>Do you want me to send the captures to the mail?</p>
