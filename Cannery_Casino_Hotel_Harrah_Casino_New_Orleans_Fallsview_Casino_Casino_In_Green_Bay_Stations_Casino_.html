    <h1>Cannery Casino Hotel Harrah Casino New Orleans Fallsview Casino Casino In Green Bay Stations Casino</h1>

<p>When you live in an forbidden country, they are suddenly ''licensed'' and located by/in Costa Rica (jurisdiction).</p>
<p>When you ask more information regarding that ''Costa Rica'' license you don't get any answer. They do know that offering their services to Dutch residents located in the Netherlands is not allowed, they still decide to do so with showing in my opinion fake Costa Rica ''license'' information which they cannot clarify further, all to only hide their real information.</p>
<p>When visiting MetaSpins their website from a Dutch IP from my home country (where I do live), they are suddenly ''licensed'' and located in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>To be clear, no business information of which they are showing (Costa Rica) can be found on the internet. Nothing can be verified, also not when asking, because emails are ignored regarding that.</p>
<p>When you visit the website with a Tor Browser (non dutch IP) they are showing real information (as also shown at Casino Guru license section);</p>
<p>''Metaspins N.V. incorporated under the laws of Curacao with registration number 160102 with a registered address at Zuikertuintjeweg Z/N (Zuikertuin Tower), Willemstad, Curaçao. Metaspins N.V. is licensed and regulated by the Curacao Gaming Authority under the License No. 365/JAZ, sub-license GLH-OCCHKTW0703232022 issued to Curaçao eGaming, authorized and regulated by the Government of Curaçao.''</p>
<p>Emails to support are ignored.</p>
<p>How can this behavior be justified? If they were so sure of their business, they would show Dutch customers their real Curacao license information.</p>
<p>Which they don't do, with a good reason which they do know. But, at the end they blame the customer, while they know that they are wrong. Otherwise they would show truthful information.</p>
<p>My complaint against them is unresolved.</p>
