<p>Hand of Anubis review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Hand of Anubis has a dark Egyptian mythology theme, focusing on the ancient god of the dead Anubis.</p>
<p>In a shadowy underworld, players will face a stone wall filled with symbols and precious artifacts. The merciless Anubis looks on, and players will need to be clever to outwit this powerful being.</p>
<p>Hand of Anubis is a good choice for fans of mythology and Ancient Egypt, especially those who are looking for a moody atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mega win in the Hand of Anubis slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The moody soundtrack is filled with tension with an almost sexy macabre. Players might feel as if they are heroes in a final showdown with the titular god himself. The reels land to the sound of stones falling, giving them a tactile authenticity.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from grey rock, adding to the bleak and unyielding nature of the underworld setting. Some symbols are cryptic ancient symbols, while others are eye-catching gold and precious gems. Sharp-eyed players will notice that the gold is subtly sculpted into ancient Egyptian emblems such as the scarab.</p>
<p>Hand of Anubis is defined by the two haunting figures of Anubis that loom beside the reels. Each of these deities has a ripped torso accented by golden accessories. His unforgettable jackal head is ferocious, and his eyes glow with supernatural light.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Hand of Anubis create a unique Egyptian mythology world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hand of Anubis is a five reel, six row slot.</p>
<p>Players are awarded wins for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the right.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish to make way for more symbols to fall in from above to take their place.</p>
<p>Players can opt to buy directly into the bonus if they wish (see further details of this feature below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all high and low paying symbols.</p>
<p>The Soul Orb symbols come in red and blue and both function as Wilds. They have the power to absorb power from cluster wins and have stacking multipliers that are applied to any wins they are part of. The red Soul Orb symbol multiplier increases by x1 for every symbol in every cluster win, while the blue Soul Orb multiplier increases by x1 per winning cluster. This multiplier is reset for every spin.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature comes in two forms with different features: the Underworld Bonus and the Judgement Bonus.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Free Spins symbols, the Underworld Bonus begins, and all paying symbols appear with a special green Soul Orb as well as a multiplier. Throughout the feature there is a multiplier underneath each of the reels, and these increase with wins.</p>
<p>The Judgment Free Spins are one of two bonuses of the game</p>
<p>If players land 4 Free Spins symbols, the Judgement Bonus begins, and the regular symbols are replaced by "block" symbols. A multiplier is added over each reel, and these are increased when players land Multiplier Modifier Blocks. These Multiplier Blocks can have an adding effect or a multiplying effect and come in Normal and Epic variations.</p>
