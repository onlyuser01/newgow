<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship, one of the most prominent martial arts promotions in the world, has signed a partnership with a sports betting operator. Moving forward, Betclic will be the Official Betting Partner of UFC in three European countries, including Poland, Portugal, and France.</p>
<p>Betclic will also be listed as a presenting partner for the upcoming UFC Fight Night Paris, which is due to take place on September 2, at the Accor Arena in Paris, France. The event will feature a main fight between Ciryl Gane and Tai Tuivasa.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by UFC VP of Global Partnerships Nicholas Smith who said that the tie-up was a fantastic opportunity for both companies. France in general constitutes a fantastic opportunity for the promotion, Smith explained.</p>
<p>Smith continued by adding that the UFC has been laser-focused on nurturing and building partnerships with local organizations and partners. Betclic is headquartered in Bordeaux, France, making it a good fit for the company, but also benefits from the fact that the brand is represented in other established European markets, boosting UFC’s profile with European fans.</p>
<p>Betclic Managing Director Nicolas Béraud added that the operator was truly excited to see this partnership take shape and in the company’s three main markets. "UFC has accomplished amazing things in developing the sport of MMA. It is at the core of our mission to promote and partner with emerging sports and enhance fans' passion," Béraud.</p>
<p>Béraud added that fans are in for fresh experiences that will be made available thanks to this new partnership and the strong ties that will be formed between the organisations. There will be numerous promotional and activation initiatives over the course of the partnership.</p>
<p>The official press statement did not specify how long this partnership is set to last, but it is likely that the partners will carry on for a while. In the meantime, Betclic signage will be available on-site the event at the Accor Arena during the event and in the UFC’s Octagon.</p>
<p>Both the UFC and Betclic will work together to also promote their new rapport on social media. This partnership also comes at a time when France is in general tightening the rules on advertisement.</p>
<p>The country is essentially looking to ensure that vulnerable consumers are protected and that advertisements in general do not use the image and likeness of people who may appeal to underage gamblers.</p>
