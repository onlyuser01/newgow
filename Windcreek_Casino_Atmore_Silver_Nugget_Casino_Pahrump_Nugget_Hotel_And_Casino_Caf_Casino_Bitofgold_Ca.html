    <h1>Windcreek Casino Atmore Silver Nugget Casino Pahrump Nugget Hotel And Casino Caf Casino Bitofgold Ca</h1>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>It is true that I have had similar cases in the past and currently.</p>
<p>However, this is because I contact new casinos almost every day, provide the casino with my details and request a self-exclusion not only from the casino, but also from the provider.</p>
<p>So I scroll through Casino Guru, Google and other sites and proactively write to various casinos in order to block myself from the casinos.</p>
<p>This is the only way for me to deal with my gambling addiction and stop myself from playing, as unfortunately no blocking software works for me either.</p>
<p>Now it's the case that sometimes I write to up to 30 different casinos every day and request a block.</p>
<p>Please forgive me if I can't wait for every single answer to see if I need to use live chat or other channels to contact you again.</p>
<p>I have written to more than 1000 casinos in the past three years. Of those 1000 casinos, perhaps a handful didn't receive my email, ignored it and therefore didn't block me.</p>
<p>It worked at all other casinos.</p>
<p>The reason why there are a few complaints within a short period of time is because I am currently providing all the documents for all casinos and would like to make them available to a lawyer.</p>
<p>In other words, I look for my loss amount, look for my personal data, see when I registered with the casino and also come across the emails that I sent you regarding self-exclusion.</p>
<p>If I then see that my account was opened after my self-exclusion email, it is only natural that I contact the casinos about it and demand a refund, since by sending my self-exclusion email I am also being excluded due to gambling have a legal basis for which a refund is due.</p>
<p>I've never really dealt with it before, but now I'm gradually looking through my documents, which also leads to this complaint.</p>
<p>Of course, it is clear to me that the casino will then first say that they did not receive the email, which may even be true. However, I did everything in my power to fight my gambling addiction and block myself from casinos and their providers.</p>
<p>As already said, these cases are only now coming to light as I am only now reviewing all the documents. I also sometimes don't remember which casinos I contacted and which ones I didn't, because it's just a very high number.</p>
<p>However, I would like to make it clear that I can provide full proof of the emails that I send to the casinos, which I have done in every case. In my opinion, these emails cannot be refuted.</p>
<p>The only thing I hope is that the casinos I emailed that didn't ban me take responsibility and offer me a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>I also actively write to these casinos because I don't want to take legal action directly, but I didn't always hope to find a solution with the casinos.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up a few open questions and presents the situation in an understandable way.</p>
