<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Hoping for Impossible</p>
<p>The Steelers are coming to Orchard Park as 10-point underdogs, which makes them the team with the least chance of winning of all the teams playing in the 2024 NFL Wild Card Round. There are several reasons for this, starting with the fact that they haven’t been too impressive throughout this entire campaign.</p>
<p>They finished the regular season with a 10-7 record, which seems pretty good, but they need to count themselves luck. For instance, they played two games with the Cincinnati Bengals after Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending injury, so it wasn’t too difficult to beat them.</p>
<p>They also defeated the mighty Baltimore Ravens in the final round of the regular season, when it was already clear that the Ravens were going to finish as the No. 1 seed.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills Owe It to Their Fans to Play Well on Sunday</p>
<p>The Bills have been brilliant this season, finishing with an 11-6 record and winning the AFC East. They won their last five games and are undefeated since November.</p>
<p>Further, each time they lost this season, they lost by a relatively small margin. In fact, six points is the biggest margin by which they lost in 2023. It happened against the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincy. It happened in early November when Joe Burrow was still healthy.</p>
<p>When it comes to their wins this season, the Bills defeated a couple of real heavyweights – the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, etc. – which is what gave their fans a reason to feel optimistic about the postseason. Many of them believe this is the year when the Bills will get to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1993.</p>
<p>But first things first – they need to defeat the Steelers on Saturday. Will they pull it off? Well, they did it in three of their last four meetings.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>Of all the teams that made it to the 2024 NFL Playoffs, it’s the Pittsburgh Steelers that scored the fewest points in the regular season. These guys had an average of 17.9 points per game. In comparison, the Buffalo Bills’ average was 26.5 PPG.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s very unlikely the Steelers are going to score much on Sunday. We think they’re gonna go under their average from the regular season.</p>
<p>What about the Bills? We think their offense is going to have a good game. At home, they’re averaging 29.5 points, which is a number we think they might reach this weekend.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills -10.0</p>
