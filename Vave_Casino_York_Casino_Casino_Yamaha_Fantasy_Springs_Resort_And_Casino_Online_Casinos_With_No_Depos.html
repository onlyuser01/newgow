<p>The innovative tech venture that focuses on the development of a leading multiplayer engagement platform, BeyondPlay, announced a new major partnership with the leading iGaming provider, Play’n GO. The new collaboration, lauded as a strategic partnership, complements BeyondPlay’s ambitious plan for the development of a unique platform.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new partnership, the exceptional game portfolio from Play’n GO becomes integral to BeyondPlay’s multiplayer-enabled games collection. Ultimately, the new strategic collaboration is expected to bring benefits for the two companies.</p>
<p>The deal with Play’n GO complements other recent agreements announced by BeyondPlay. Such successful collaborations include deals with leading iGaming studios, including BTG and Relax Gaming, among others. The new deal represents another milestone for the company and comes ahead of the launch of its multiplayer software.</p>
<p>Karolina Pelc, BeyondPlay’s CEO and founder, revealed that the company is thrilled to join forces with such a trusted and respected studio like Play’n GO. “Our vision has always been to push the boundaries of gaming innovation, and this collaboration takes us one step closer to that goal,” she added. In conclusion, Pelc said that she is looking forward to the success of the company’s multiplayer software which is expected to bring unique and engaging experiences.</p>
<p>“I am incredibly grateful and excited to welcome such an accomplished and respected studio on board with BeyondPlay.“ Karolina Pelc, founder and CEO at BeyondPlay</p>
<p>Last month, Play’n GO confirmed it will continue to serve as the title sponsor of the Swedish professional ice hockey club, Växjö Lakers. The company has now been serving as a title sponsor for the club for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Play’n GO Is Excited to Team Up with BeyondPlay</p>
<p>Johan Törnqvist, Play’n GO’s CEO and co-founder, shared the excitement of BeyondPlay’s boss. He spoke about Play’n GO’s ongoing goal to deliver thrilling and entertaining games, backed by innovation that can help make a difference in the gambling sector. Finally, Törnqvist said: “BeyondPlay is on the cutting edge of innovation in our industry, and that’s why we are excited to support their journey as they give players worldwide another way to enjoy Play’n GO games.”</p>
<p>Late last month, Play’n GO became a signatory of The Climate Pledge, a global environmental initiative supported by more than 400 companies across the globe. At the time, the Swedish-based iGaming content provider reaffirmed its commitment toward sustainable growth and a future that is environmentally friendly.</p>
