    <h1>Tradition Casino Casino Immokalee Fl Casino In Las Vegas Nv Twin Rivers Casino Bitcoin Casino Napole</h1>

<p>The Belgian operator gained access to Pragmatic's Live Casino portfolio under the terms of an extended agreement</p>
<p>The provider of iGaming content, renowned for producing up to eight new slot titles every month, Pragmatic Play, announced it extended its existing agreement with Belgium’s market-leading gambling operator, Napoleon Sports and Casino. Under the extended agreement, Pragmatic agreed to supply the operator with its wide range of Live Casino games. Additionally, the company will launch two custom-branded tables for Napoleon Sports and Casino.</p>
<p>As noted, the latest collaboration builds upon an existing deal between the duo. Previously, Napoleon Casino tapped into Pragmatic’s portfolio of slots games. However, now, customers of the operator will have the chance to engage in the thrilling experience of the provider’s Roulette and Blackjack titles. Additionally, Napoleon’s customers will benefit from Pragmatic’s Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, among other hit gameshow titles.</p>
<p>The two dedicated Blackjack and Roulette tables would bring further engaging experiences for customers of the market-leading operator in Belgium. The gaming operator will have the chance to customize the look and feel of the table, elevating the excitement and thrill, while Flemish-speaking live dealers will contribute toward the local experience.</p>
<p>The partnership with Napoleon comes after earlier this week, Pragmatic Play expanded its portfolio of games. On Monday, the leading provider of iGaming content confirmed the release of Twilight Princess slot, the latest addition to its popular Princess series. The latest slot game, featuring the fan-favorite cluster pays mechanic, offers an RTP of 96.08% and brings multipliers, sticky wilds and free spins.</p>
<p>The Extended Deal Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Nicolas Van Malderghem, Napoleon’s head of casino, spoke about the importance of the expanded partnership with Pragmatic. He highlighted the growing popularity of the iGaming provider’s slots among players in Belgium.</p>
<p>According to Van Malderghem, the popular Live Casino games from Pragmatic will enable Napoleon to engage with more players that like traditional card games. “The unique branded tables will also give us a strong advantage over competitors, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Pragmatic Play,” explained the head of casino in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Expanding our partnership with Pragmatic Play was a natural next step following the popularity of its Slots on our platform.“ Nicolas Van Malderghem, head of casino at Napoleon Sports and Casino</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic’s chief operating officer, added that the company is delighted to expand its agreement with the leading Belgian operator. She praised the importance of Pragmatic delivering its entire portfolio of Live Casino games for Napoleon. Finally, Cornides pointed out: “Napoleon will also benefit from our fully dedicated Blackjack and Roulette tables, ensuring a more integrated, immersive, and localized experience for their players.”</p>
