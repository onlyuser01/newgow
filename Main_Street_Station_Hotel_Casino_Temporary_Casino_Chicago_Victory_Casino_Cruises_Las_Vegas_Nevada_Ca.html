<p>Partypoker MILLION Relaunches</p>
<p>It was 13 years ago that the last partypoker MILLION tournament was held. Now, it has returned to the online poker world, providing players across the web with the chance to win their share of an impressive $1 million pool.</p>
<p>The partypoker MILLION consists of four Day 1s, and there is a flexible format. Players can enter as many of the Day 1s as they want, but they’ll only be able to take their largest stack with them into Day 2. The Day 1s have 21 levels that are 10 minutes each, which means that there are just 3.5 hours of play – much shorter than most online poker tournaments.</p>
<p>“The return of partypoker MILLION is great news for players of all levels, who can now play for a huge $1,000,000 guaranteed every Sunday on partypoker” sSam Trickett, a member of Team Partypoker.</p>
<p>There are also several smaller tournaments that players can take part in. The schedule for the remaining partypoker MILLION events is as follows:</p>
<p>Sat 2 Nov 8:00 p.m. partypoker Mini Day 1G: $200K Gtd $22 8:00 p.m. partypoker Micro Day 1G: $20K Gtd $2.20 Sun 3 Nov 3:00 p.m. partypoker MILLION Day 1D: $1M Gtd $215 3:00 p.m. partypoker Mini Day 1H: $200K Gtd $22 3:00 p.m. partypoker Micro Day 1H: $20K Gtd $2.20 7:00 p.m. partypoker MILLION Final Day: $1M Gtd 7:00 p.m. partypoker Mini Final Day: $200K Gtd 7:00 p.m. partypoker Micro Final Day: $20K Gtd</p>
<p>There are some very big guarantees on offer in this event, and it looks like partypoker may not meet them. In the million, over 4600 runners would be needed to meet the guarantee. So far, just over 2400 players have bought in, so partypoker needs to attract over 2000 more runners on the fourth Day 1.</p>
<p>The overlay isn’t’ great news for partypoker, but it’s good for players. With fewer players competing for the top prize, each player has a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>While $215 might be a bit steep for most players, there are also several satellites that feed into the partypoker MILLION. The site’s new Tournament Dollars (T$) can also be used to buy-in to the event if you have enough.</p>
<p>The best thing about this event is that it’s on every week! So, you can vie for a huge prize often. It’s a great new initiative from partypoker.</p>
