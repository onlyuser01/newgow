<p>Doubles review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>Doubles takes the classic one-armed bandit theme and adds a couple of twists to the theme.</p>
<p>Each symbol comes in both a single and double form. The double form counts as two for winline and payout purposes. The game also has a visual twist with the images being formed from old school looking polygon graphics.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the theme is pretty standard slot machine fare. Plenty of fruit, some lucky sevens, diamonds, and horseshoes.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are rather pleasing. The polygon cartoon style is bright and fun, the images easy to read off on each reel.</p>
<p>The spin noises are electronic thunks and chimes that are highly satisfying. Although the soundtrack music is a garish electronica beat that is very distracting. Luckily the game controls make turning the music off very easy.</p>
<p>The animations are very smooth, and the same settings that give you control over the music also allow you to adjust the speed of the animations so that you can either slow the game down to increase tension or speed it up to get as many spins into your session as possible.</p>
<p>Small 5-symbols win</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is a five reel game with the 243 pay way system instead of standard winlines.</p>
<p>Each of the symbols comes in two types: single and double (indicated below by the difference between the double lemons and single lemons). Each double symbol counts as if you hit two of that symbol. So in the image below you win the value of hitting five lemons.</p>
<p>This means you can hit up to ten of any symbol by hitting one double on every reel (a double on every reel in that winline).</p>
<p>The downside of the gameplay is that bonus game is just free spins which can feel a little simplistic. Though it does introduce some interactivity which is always nice.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring 10 free spins with top symbol pick, without luck though</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The bonus for this game comes in the form of free spins.</p>
<p>The Free Spin symbol triggers as a scatter symbol, so if you hit the Free Spin symbol on any three or more reels in any order you will win your free spins.</p>
<p>At the start of the free spins, you get to chose one symbol to double. For the duration of the free spins, the symbol you choose will have all the single symbols converted to doubles. The more valuable the symbol that you double is, the less likely you are to hit it. So although the choice doesn’t affect RTP, it will make a difference to your volatility.</p>
<p>Choose your Doubles for the Free spins game</p>
<p>Free spins are apportioned as follows: 3 Free Spin symbols get you 10 free spins, 4 gets you 20, and 5 symbols gets you 40 spins.</p>
<p>There is no wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>This is a low variance slot, which we tend to avoid for strategic reasons. It comes with a bog standard 96.00% RTP.</p>
<p>Highest possible win isn't very attractive for high rollers</p>
<p>Medium symbols paytable in the Doubles</p>
<p>The possible bet size per spin range from €/£/$0.25 to €/£/$50.00 which is enough for most purposes, but might leave the highest and lowest rollers wanting to look elsewhere for their thrills.</p>
<p>These setbacks undermine an otherwise well put together slot.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Doubles is a fun slot that is nice to look at and fun to play. It is a little over simple (one bonus of just free spins).</p>
<p>It is also somewhat let down by its low volatility although the RTP is a perfectly acceptable 96.00%.</p>
<p>This slot will appeal to those who like old school fruit machine slots.</p>
