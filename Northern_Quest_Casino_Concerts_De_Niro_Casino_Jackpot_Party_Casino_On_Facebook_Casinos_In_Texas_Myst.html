<p>Get Ready for a Heavier Cascade with a TNT Bang</p>
<p>The world-famous Tumble series has returned with a more exciting cascade of wins than ever. Players are invited to go down the mine and start looking for the mighty treasure while getting ready to grab the magnificent jackpot about to drop. Players can get ready to collect a variety of rock features, different prize pools, and five types of jackpots: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major, and Mega. While engaged in the Drop Bonus, players can land a number of stone blocks or come across Dream Drop symbols. The Dream Drop symbols will stay on the reels while the stone blocks get gradually destroyed. The spins are then played until one of the reels is packed with Dream Drop symbols, bringing players a cool jackpot.</p>
<p>Free Spins for Lucky Miners</p>
<p>When all the dark stone blocks are taken down while engaged in the base game, players trigger the Free Spins feature. During it, the luckiest of miners can discover special blocks with additional free spins and added multipliers. To get two extra free spins, players need to clear every third complete row filled with dark stone blocks. To get more bonuses, players should be on the look for TNT stone blocks. These blocks can destroy all dark stone blocks on the respective row.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon expressed delight in launching the game that mixes “the time-honored slot theme of mining with the heart-pounding excitement” given by Dream Drop jackpots. The game is expected to appeal to players in different parts of the world and demographics. The provider has an impressive collection consisting of over 4,000 casino games including proprietary slots and games from cherry-picked titles from third-party gaming studios through partnership deals.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August, Relax Gaming signed a partnership agreement with bet365. According to the terms of the deal, Relax Gaming will have its aggregated content show up on the bet365 platform. The list of games includes many popular in-house slot games, including Snake Arena, Money Train 2, and Temple Tumble, along with games from 50+ providers and partners via the Powered By Relax and Silver Bullet programs. In July, Relax Gaming added Appart Gaming to its Powered by Relax platform, providing it maximum exposure.</p>
