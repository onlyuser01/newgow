    <h1>Casino In Tucson Az Rio All Suite Casino Hotel Luxor Hotel Casino Augustine Casino Coachella Ca Carn</h1>

<p>I have received one withdrawal of â‚¬ 490 I have now had three 490e withdrawals at the same time for 2 weeks because the casino can withdraw 500e a day and can have three withdrawals open. my game account is 1500e and 2 withdrawals now total 980e.</p>
<p>my account is verified and everything is fine it is said in the chat and that there is a delay and apologies but the problem itself is not talked about and round answers are given.</p>
<p>(15:07:45) Sammy: Joni, please note as per the terms, you can only have up to 3 active withdrawals at the same time. Once, one of the 3 has been processed, then you'll be able to proceed with making an additional one. Furthermore, all withdrawals undergo a 3-day pending period. Once complete and processed it may take an additional few days depending on the payment method and bank, excluding weekends. You will receive a confirmation email from the finance team once sent out to you.</p>
<p>so it is not an account or confirmation etc. for some reason the money does not move out, I make withdrawals and they are interrupted due to time delay or some other reason and the money is returned to the game account to be played, it is said that sorry for the disturbance try to withdraw again and wait the same week again.</p>
