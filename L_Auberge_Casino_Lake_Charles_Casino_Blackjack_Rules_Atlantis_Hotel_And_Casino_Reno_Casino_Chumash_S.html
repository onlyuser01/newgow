<p>Content from more Penn Entertainment racetracks will be added to the MonmouthBets platform in the months to follow</p>
<p>BetMakers Technology Group, a provider of betting tech, has added racing content from Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course to the fixed odds horseracing platform MonmouthBets in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The agreement between BetMakers’ Global Racing Network and Penn Entertainment allows for easy delivery of content for fixed odds betting from Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The two parties are likely to expand their agreement in the coming months and add other Penn Entertainment racetracks to the deal. However, this will depend on certain approvals from relevant authorities.</p>
<p>With Penn National Race Course as one of the United States’ best venues for thoroughbred horseracing, New Jersey customers will be able to benefit from reliable betting data and odds.</p>
<p>MonmouthBets, the United States’ only legal, regulated fixed odds horse racing platform, continues to steadily grow, adding content from more and more respected horseracing venues. As a result, players in New Jersey are now able to place fixed odds wagers on racing events from a total of 16 racetracks across the US, Canada the Caribbean and South America.</p>
<p>Penn Entertainment Hopes the Deal Will Benefit the Sector as a Whole</p>
<p>BetMakers Technology Group’s chief executive officer, Jake Henson, said that his team is delighted to make Penn National’s races available to racing aficionados in the Garden State. He praised Penn National for delivering some of the best races in the US and lauded the company’s availability for fixed odds betting.</p>
<p>The new addition, Henson said, will “expand New Jersey’s fixed odds betting content schedule.”</p>
<p>PENN Entertainment is a valued partner to BetMakers and we are excited to demonstrate the opportunities that the combination of fixed odds and tote betting – when offered on a robust racing menu – can offer North American racing’s stakeholders. Jake Henson, CEO, BetMakers Technology Group</p>
<p>Henson concluded that his team cannot wait to add more Penn Entertainment content to its fixed odds platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Penn Entertainment’s vice president of racing, Chris McErlean, said:</p>
<p>We are very happy to work with BetMakers to offer New Jersey’s racing fans an opportunity to bet fixed odds on Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course. Chris McErlean, VP of racing, Penn Entertainment</p>
<p>The VP added that his team is very interested to see how New Jersey customers react to the Penn National Race Course content. He hopes that the integration will generate positive returns for the horseracing.</p>
<p>In other Penn-related news, the company just moved its Barstool sportsbook to its proprietary online gaming platform. The migration will make the brand more competitive, allowing Penn to retain an edge over its competitors.</p>
