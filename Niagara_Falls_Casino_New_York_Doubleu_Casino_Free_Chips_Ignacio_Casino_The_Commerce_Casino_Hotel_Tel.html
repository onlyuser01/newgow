<p>Tickets for the 2023 Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix go on sale to the public at 10 a.m. on Saturday, November 5 via ticketmaster.com. Prices start at $500. Tickets, sold as 3-day passes only, are limited to eight per purchaser. .</p>

<p>Ticket demand is expected to far outstrip the 100K official spectator capacity for the race, which starts at 10 p.m. on Saturday night, Nov. 18, 2023</p>
<p>According to a news release from F1, a presale for American Express Card Members will be held from 10 a.m. on Tuesday, November 1 through 9:59 a.m. Thursday, November 3. After that, organizers wrote, “The priority interest list will receive early access to a dedicated ticket allotment beginning on Thursday, November 3 at 10 a.m. PT.”</p>
<p>The priority interest list, a promotion that is no longer available on F1’s website, offered prospective ticket buyers a chance to buy tickets early by donating $7.77 to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to alleviating hunger in Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>Different seating packages, with vantage points across the circuit, were announced in F1’s news release, but no prices were mentioned. According to the release, they include (presumably from least to most expensive):</p>

<p>In August, MGM Resorts International CEO Bill Hornbuckle told the Sports Business Journal that his company plans to scoop up $20 million to $25 million worth of tickets, with an eye toward cobbling together hotel/race packages with $100K price tags.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on a 17-corner, 3.8-mile temporary loop through Caesars Palace, the MSG Sphere, and the Bellagio, its finish line. Top speeds are estimated to be over 212 mph.</p>
<p>F1 held a Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas in 1981 and 1982, but that was limited to the resort’s parking lot.</p>
