    <h1>Isle Casino Hotel Golden Nugget Hotel And Casino In Louisiana Davinci Gold Casino Casino Omaha Oklah</h1>

<p>Many states where casino gambling is legal prohibit adults from leaving their children alone in order to gamble. With punishments varying from one state to another, in general, people who are found to have left their children unattended to gamble can be subject to fines and criminal charges. Moreover, such individuals may be placed on an involuntary exclusion list that prohibits them from engaging in gambling activities.</p>
<p>Now a new report reveals that Evansville, Indiana, police officers arrested one person earlier this week who allegedly left a young child unattended at a casino’s parking garage. The person, identified with the initials I.J., 27, was arrested and booked into the Vanderburgh County Jail on multiple charges, 44 News reports.</p>
<p>Besides neglect, the 27-year-old reportedly faced charges for driving on a suspended license and had a warrant for failure to appear for the suspended license. The bond for the individual is set at $850. What punishment he may face for the alleged crimes is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Dispatched Police Officers Find a Child Left Alone</p>
<p>The incident dates back to Wednesday night this week when around 11:55 PM law enforcement was contacted about a child that was left alone inside of a car parked at Bally’s Evansville parking garage. Upon arriving on the scene, police officers questioned a security guard who admitted they saw a child walking around the parking garage’s second floor. Moreover, the security guard confirmed they found a running car with a child inside.</p>
<p>Investigating further, police uncovered CCTV footage, showing the car entering the garage approximately one hour before they were contacted. The 27-year-old, presumably the father or legal guardian of the child, explained to the dispatched police officers that he went inside the casino to find another person but “lost track of time.”</p>
<p>Checking his identity, police uncovered that the 27-year-old driver’s license was suspended. Although he admitted to driving the car earlier, he wasn’t aware that a warrant was issued for him over failure to appear.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, similar incidents resulted in the ban of four casino patrons in Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), the gambling regulator in the state, confirmed it banned four individuals who allegedly left a total of six minors unattended and engaged in gambling activities. The four patrons were added to the state’s Involuntary Exclusion List, prohibiting them from gambling across the state.</p>
