<p>Majestic Forest review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Majestic Forest has for its setting the woodlands of the northern United States. Bears, foxes and elk live in harmony. And at its heart a strange stone dolmen sits.</p>
<p>The ethereal green beauty of the background and symbols justify the makers giving the forest setting the adjective "majestic."</p>
<p>There are plenty of animal based slots out there, but few focus on this particular ecosystem. As a result, it feels fresh, and the forest is oddly relaxing. Come in under the leaves.</p>
<p>Majestic Forest - win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The front end of the slot is pretty good.</p>
<p>It still has some of the clunkiness of other EGT slots. For example, there is no background music and the win and spin sounds are generic. But the artwork is quality stuff and the background is really quite attractive.</p>
<p>The animations are simple, but work well with the artwork and the generally quite laid back feel of the slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is the standard EGT fare. A five reel slot with three rows and up to ten winlines. There is the usual four tier progressive jackpot system and a simple free spin bonus.</p>
<p>There is a gamble feature that allows players to play for double or nothing on a fifty-fifty shot. This doesn’t affect the RTP, but ramps up the volatility whenever it is used.</p>
<p>Standard EGT gamble feature</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol is also the Scatter symbol and it substitutes for all other symbols.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels trigger the Free Spin Bonus. The player gets twelve free spins with a randomised expanding symbol. The expanding symbol expands to fill the reel whenever it lands during a spin.</p>
<p>It is a pretty simple bonus feature, but you can always use the gamble feature to spice things up.</p>
<p>There are four progressive jackpots, one for each of the suits in a deck of cards. They increase at different rates and so in general their size runs from clubs, diamonds, hearts, to spades.</p>
<p>A Jackpot Bonus can randomly trigger at the end of any base game spin. When the jackpot triggers, the player is taken to a picking game in which they are dealt 12 cards face down. The player then turns cards over until they hit three cards all in the same suit. The player is then awarded the jackpot of the same suit.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.19%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€60.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, which makes it a match for our preferred slot machine strategies, but a very weak one. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Majestic Forest slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With nice visuals and decent gameplay, Majestic Forest is a good slot for fans of animal themed slots that are a bit more chilled out than they are wild.</p>
<p>With medium-high volatility and the long shot of bringing home one of the big jackpots, this game works quite well with our preferred slot strategies. The average RTP could be higher, but isn’t bad.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this slot.</p>
