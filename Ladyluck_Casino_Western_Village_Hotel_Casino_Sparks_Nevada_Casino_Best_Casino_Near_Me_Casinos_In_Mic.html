<p>According to ACR Poker, its MO PLO tournaments are “the perfect excuse to put off Christmas shopping“</p>
<p>ACR Poker unveiled the return of its popular MO MO MO PLO promotion, promising a lot of holiday excitement to poker fans in Omaha. The promotion aligns with the company’s desire to spread joy and help its customers make memories.</p>
<p>According to ACR Poker, the promotion will run from December 3 through December 17 and will be even better than its previous iterations. In addition to giving Omaha “the attention it deserves,” ACR Poker will provide local players with three ways to “get MO out of their game.” According to the company, poker enthusiasts can get MO money with a generous Reload Bonus, as well as through MO PLO cash games and tournaments.</p>
<p>Bonuses Await</p>
<p>The MO Reload Bonus, for example, allows customers to receive a 50% Reload Bonus up to $2,500 if they use the MOBONUS promo code. Players can use the bonus by participating in Omaha cash games and tournaments and will have 30 days to release it.</p>
<p>Mo Cash Games will provide customers with a selection of MO PLO cash games. Players can play PLO cash games over 30 days to release the bonus. In addition, they will earn double points during Happy Hours (6 am to 8 am ET and 10 pm to 12 am ET) during the promotion period.</p>
<p>MO Tournaments, on the other hand, allow fans to take advantage of MO PLO tournaments to release their bonus. There will be a total of 101 events with a total of $1,165,500 in guarantees. Buy-ins for these events will range from $3 to $630. According to ACR Poker, satellites will also be available.</p>
<p>Players can learn more information about the MO MO MO PLO by visiting the promotion’s official webpage.</p>
<p>The Perfect Excuse to Put Off Shopping</p>
<p>According to ACR Poker, its MO PLO tournaments are “the perfect excuse to put off Christmas shopping.” While the company will offer a number of events, it highlighted two main events which feature 82 Day 1 Flights with Day 2 on Sunday, December 17.</p>
<p>The first event is the $200,000 GTD PLO Mystery Bounty tourney, which will have $55 buy-ins. The other is the $50,000 GTD PLO Mystery Bounty tourney with $11 buy-ins.</p>
<p>ACR Poker concluded that MO MO MO PLO is not the only thing poker fans can look forward to. In addition to that, the company announced that it is bringing its ACR Reshuffle security technology to PLO 4 games.</p>
