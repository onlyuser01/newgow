<p>Australia-based gambling machine manufacturer Aristocrat Gaming announced that it is opening a new management position for the vice president of communications and corporate affairs. The person chosen for this new role is Oriana Branon Monday, who will become a member of the company’s executive leadership team.</p>
<p>Branon’s Previous Experience Should Translate Well to the New Position</p>
<p>Branon has considerable experience managing communications in various sectors. Her latest position was with financial tech developer Bill.com, where she was in charge of corporate communications. Her resume also includes work for the aviation industry as Alaska Airlines’ first PR hire in California. Branon holds a double major in Communications and Sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Branon focuses on improving the education of women of color and helping to develop underserved communities. Both Latina Style and Forbes recognized her as a Latina advocate, and her professional experience has earned her a spot in PRWeek Magazine’s “Women to Watch” and “40 Under 40”. Her other passion is writing, and her pieces on womanhood and parenting have been featured in The Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>Branon’s new position will see her head the external and internal communications for Aristocrat’s Gaming division. Her other duties will include providing strategic guidance on the company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria to ensure Aristocrat’s social responsibility, ethical impact, sustainability, and inclusiveness. Branon will be working directly under Hector Fernandez, the company’s CEO.</p>
<p>This New Hire Is Likely a Result of Aristocrat’s Recent Growth</p>
<p>Fernandez expressed his excitement to have Branon join Aristocrat’s management in the company’s mission to “bring joy to life through the power of play.” He lauded Branon’s communications expertise in various fields and dedication to social initiatives. “She will be an incredible asset to our company during a time of rapid growth,” the CEO concluded.</p>
<p>Branon also had positive comments about joining Aristocrat and exclaimed that she was looking forward to “working with the team to capture the tremendous opportunity ahead.” The new VP of communications and corporate affairs noted the company’s award-winning history and expressed her eagerness to assume her new role.</p>
<p>Branon’s hire comes during a strong upturn for Aristocrat. JP Morgan recently reported that the company had recovered to pre-pandemic levels and had a very optimistic growth forecast. Expected revenue and EBITDA growth is about 20% as Aristocrat’s products enjoy worldwide success in Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Macau, and Singapore, among other countries.</p>
