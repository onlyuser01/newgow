<p>About exclusive no deposit bonuses</p>
<p>A no deposit bonus is one of the most popular offers an online casino can offer its players. Presented in the form of bonus credit or free spins, it allows you to try out a new online casino, and possibly win a small amount of money, with zero financial risk.</p>
<p>You don't need to deposit any money to claim a no deposit bonus – as the name suggests – you simply register with the casino who then award you the free credit or spins. Where and how you use the bonus is specified in the casino's rules: it might be that certain games are excluded, or that you have a bet or win limit, so it's good to check these conditions out in advance.</p>
<p>Note: You might ask why casinos do this when they don't earn money out of them, but the truth is that they often do later on. A player who enjoys their casino experience with the bonus may decide to deposit money to play again — plus it's good publicity for the casino to show a generous nature.</p>
<p>No deposit bonuses are virtually always a nice offer, but you can get some particularly good deals on this page that are reserved exclusively for Casino Guru visitors. These are our exclusive no deposit bonuses, and you can check out their details in the information box next to each one.</p>
<p>The next section will explore how you can get the very best of those deals.</p>
<p>How to find the best exclusive no deposit bonus code</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you'll see a certain number of exclusive no deposit bonuses available to players in your country right now. It might be that you have many of these to choose from, in which case going through each one is pretty time-consuming.</p>
<p>To help you with this, you can use a set of filters and sorts to arrange the list in a certain order so that your preferred options appear at the top.</p>
<p>An example of this is the Wagering Requirement (WR) filter. This is the amount of money you need to stake to get hold of your bonus winnings, usually expressed as a multiple of your bonus. You can find out more about WR in our How casino bonuses work article.</p>
<p>Many players like to find bonuses with the lowest WR possible, and you can do this by adjusting the slide-rule in the 'Maximum WR' section. Let's say you want a maximum of 20x WR; you simply move the icon to x20, which would mean that the bonuses you see all have less than x20 WR.</p>
<p>You might also want to see those with a certain bonus amount and value, or number of free spins – again, you can use the slide-rule mechanism for all of these.</p>
<p>One last thing to note. It's equally important to find a good casino offering the bonus, so there are also filters to help you with that. Go to the 'Filter by casinos' section and pick your preferences in the different categories to make sure you get the best possible site. Maybe you want a casino with a certain payment method, in which case you choose your preferred option from the 'Payment Method' section.</p>
<p>All the exclusive bonuses you see on this page should be relevant to you as of the date of your search due to the Casino Guru team working hard to keep them up to date. Newest no deposit bonuses can be found in the 'Latest' tab.</p>
