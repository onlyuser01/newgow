    <h1>Directions To The Hard Rock Casino Tropicana Online Casino Atlantic City Riverside Casino Buffet Cas</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I signed up in this casino a week ago. I made a total of 5 deposits using 150% bonuses. I reassured with live chat that I am eligible to redeem those bonuses. Their answer was that I could use any bonus available in my account section. After wagering the last deposit bonus completely I ended up with 4800€ account balance. After my account was fully verified, the casino still canceld my withdrawal and I recieved this from live chat:</p>
<p>Hello Lukas,</p>
<p>Our apologies for the delay in responding to you, we are not available over the weekend and Support was not updated before the weekend.</p>
<p>Your withdrawal request was initially approved (why Support confirmed it to you), however a number of accounts, including yours, were flagged for further checks due to fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, we found that you used the same bonus on multiple occasions and this is in direct contravention of our Bonus Terms (please see: https://cetusgames.com/en/bonus-terms points 1.1 and 1.15).</p>
<p>The bonus in question was used twice (2) on 13/10/2022 and a further three (3) times on 17/10/2022.</p>
<p>Rather than removing the balance in total, the decision was made to return your total Deposits. We see this and full and final settlement of this case.</p>
<p>We do hope you choose to continue playing with us at Cetus Games.</p>
<p>Wishing you everything of the best,</p>
<p>Cetus Compliance Team "</p>
<p>If the live agent had told me that I am NOT eligible for the bonus that was available in my bonus section then I would not have played it and risking my money. It seems this site is softwarewise unfinished, otherwise this bonus would not have shown up in my account.</p>
<p>It is not that I opened up multiple accounts to make use of a welcome offer multiple times, I only have this one account.</p>
<p>In the end I was risking 840€ of my own money in total which I would have not seen again, if I lost the 5 balances.</p>
<p>This seems to be not fair since I asked the support before claiming the 150% before my deposits.</p>
<p>I would be happy to agree to some sort of compromise, like getting paid 4800 substracted by the 1220€ bonus money I have been using. But only getting back my deposits is, for the reasons described above, unfair.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
