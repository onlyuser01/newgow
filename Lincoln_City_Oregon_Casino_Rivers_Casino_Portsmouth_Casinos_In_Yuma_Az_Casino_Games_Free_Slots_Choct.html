<p>Clarion Gaming has shared the official dates for ICE and iGB Affiliate for this year. Even though the original plan was for ICE London to take place from February 1 to February 3 and iGB Affiliate London to take place from February 2 to February 5, they were postponed due to the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Now, the new dates for these two events are April 12 to April 14 and April 13 to April 14, respectively.</p>
<p>Both Events to Be Held at ExCeL London</p>
<p>ExCeL London will host both ICE and iGB Affiliate events and the week will kick off with the ICE VOX conference, which is scheduled on April 11. The first conference will be the World Regulatory Briefing and International Casino Conference. iGB Affiliate will start on April 13 and it will host the annual iGB Awards at the Troxy on the same day.</p>
<p>The managing director of Clarion Gaming, Stuart Hunter, stated that there were two reasons that influenced the decision to choose the specific April dates. First off, he said that after consulting with customers from all around the world, they came to the conclusion that the Omicron variant was just too unpredictable and made the market unstable.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that the main goal was to provide venue staff, visitors, and exhibitors with a “safe and secure environment,” a decision has been made to postpone the events and host them in mid-April. As for the reason why those specific dates were chosen, Hunter said that Clarion Gaming made sure not to clash its dates with the Indian Gaming Tradeshow &amp; Convention, which is scheduled to take place in Anaheim, CA, from April 19 to April 22. After all, Clarion Gaming has shown appreciation to US tribes and recently it joined forces with NIGA to empower the tribal community in the country. Both parties stated that they were more than happy to work together and help each other grow.</p>
<p>Hunter took a moment to show gratitude to the Indian Gaming Tradeshow &amp; Convention and publicly thanked the organization for its support and understanding and closed off by saying that Clarion will continue to work hard, no matter how challenging the recent period is and regardless of the challenges that the future brings.</p>
<p>More Than 700 Exhibitors Will Be Present at ExCeL London</p>
<p>While sharing details on the event itself, Hunter stated that this is becoming the most important week of the year for many brands and buyers in the world of gaming. He also added that this year, ExCeL London will feature over 700 exhibitors.</p>
<p>Naomi Barton, the portfolio director of iGB Affiliate, stated that iGB Live! and iGB Affiliate Amsterdam, held in 2021, showed the importance of in-person events and added that she’s more than happy to secure new dates just 6 months after Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Barton closed off by saying that the main focus will be to build on iGB’s momentum and further establish its brand as the best in the world by delivering the biggest iGaming affiliate event in London this year.</p>
