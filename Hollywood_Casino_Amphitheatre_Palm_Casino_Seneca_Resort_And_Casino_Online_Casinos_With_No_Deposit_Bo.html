<p>Big Time Gaming’s proprietor megaways feature will become a permanent part of the portfolio of yet another provider with Microgaming signing a licensing agreement for the mechanic.</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming and Microgaming Strike a Fresh Licensing Agreement</p>
<p>Microgaming has forged a new partnership with Big Time Gaming for the latter’s proprietor Megaways technology. As a result, BTG will deploy the megaways feature across a number of upcoming Microgaming slots starting early next year.</p>
<p>For its part, Microgaming will collaborate with a number of independent developers and help them integrate the mechanic for unspecified number of upcoming releases. Microgaming will start the megaways overhaul with Shamrock Holmes, a game with a distinct Irish slot theme.</p>
<p>The megaways feature was originally debuted in 2016 and has been a tremendous success. This mechanic creates a dynamic grid interface and boosts the number of possible payouts to thousands at a time. Thanks to a random reel modifier, each spin creates a completely new gameplay environment providing the player with a unique experience.</p>
<p>With the first megaways game set to arrive in January 2021, the studio will have several months to prepare how to best approach the megaways roll-out as well as plan how to scale up the experience from there on in.</p>
<p>Moving into Megaways Territory</p>
<p>On explaining the studio’s motivation behind the adoption of the feature, Microgaming CEO John Coleman was happy to offer his insight. Coleman said that the megaways feature had had a huge success and integrating the mechanic as a core part of the offer was an exciting step for his company.</p>
<p>The developers at Big Time Gaming have proven themselves as innovators, Coleman continued, and added that Microgaming considered it a privilege to extend the relationship with the studio and their unique platform.</p>
<p>Responding to this, Big Time Gaming CEO Nik Robinson said that the company was committed to expanding the reach of their unique slot mechanic to a wider audience. Choosing Microgaming as a partner was a sensible move, Robinson clarified as the team behind Microgaming is industry pioneers. He further added:</p>
<p>“As ardent slots fans, we’re delighted to be contributing in a small way to the Microgaming story.”</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming has a sizeable portfolio of games and a growing list of partners. The studio has released some interesting games, such as Monopoly Megaways and extended megaways licensing to Red Tiger for the arrival of Gonzo’s Quest Megaways.</p>
<p>The original game is one of the most iconic slot games in iGaming introducing avalanche reels and multipliers to the gameplay experience. Microgaming signed an esports partnership with Unikrn, a first for the company.</p>
