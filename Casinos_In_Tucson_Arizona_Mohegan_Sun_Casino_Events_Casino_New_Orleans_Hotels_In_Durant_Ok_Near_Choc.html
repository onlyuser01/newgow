<p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>thank you for your feedback. I would be happy to answer your questions, in order:</p>
<p>1.) Can you please advise how long after your request you lost your money?</p>
<p>On 06/21/2022 at 09:51 am I emailed support to verify my details and that I would like my account blocked because I have a gambling addiction and I want to protect the money. Westcasino then requested further documentation but did not suspend my account. On June 21st, 2022 I had 4600 EUR in the casino account. My account would not be blocked within 24 hours (should have been blocked by 09:50 a.m. on 22.06.2022 at the latest. My verification was delayed, with the same documents that you requested, but no exclusion. Then unfortunately I feared the delay and didn't answer my request, I couldn't save my money and ultimately continued playing and then went down to zero EUR on the evening of June 22, 2022.</p>
<p>2.) Is your account currently still active?</p>
<p>No my account was closed yesterday after requesting my money back.</p>
<p>3.) Have you contacted the casino for a refund and if so what was their reply? What is your current balance?</p>
<p>Yes I wrote, that was their last answer: once you place a bet in the casino, it is final, you receive the result of that bet in the account - whether you win or lose, and it is not possible to get a refund , once you have used the money to place bets.</p>
<p>The whole thing is really not fair, because I suspected that something like this would happen and immediately when I wanted to pay out my money I asked for a block due to the gambling addiction and that you should pay me the money despite that, even if I'm no longer active. Normally I would never lose 4600 EUR within 1 1/2 days. But I knew about my addiction and I immediately stated my wish and request. Westcasino writes in their terms and conditions that an account will be blocked within 24 hours at the latest if requested. But in this case it wasn't.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>EY</p>
