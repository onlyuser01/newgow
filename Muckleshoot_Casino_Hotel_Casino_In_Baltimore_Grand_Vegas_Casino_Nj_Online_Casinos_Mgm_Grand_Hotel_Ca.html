    <h1>Muckleshoot Casino Hotel Casino In Baltimore Grand Vegas Casino Nj Online Casinos Mgm Grand Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>Sweden-based slot developer with a vision to become “the best gaming entertainment supplier there is” Play’n GO has recently released its freshest rock band-themed slot, Dio – Killing the Dragon. The game brings tribute to the popular heavy metal band formed in the US four decades ago by two former Black Sabbath members. The studio managed to beautifully capture the spirit of this iconic band known for hit songs like Don’t Talk to Strangers, We Rock, and Evil Eyes. one interesting fact about the new release is that it does not actually include any of the songs part of the “Dio Killing the Dragon” album released in 2002 by the band.</p>

<p>Take the Holy Dive and Fight Some Dragons</p>
<p>Team up with the group’s lead vocalist Ronnie James Dio and let his magical music help you fight against the dragons, wild wolves, and other powerful creatures roaming around. Get ready to scoop up as many Scatter symbols as possible and unlock the door guarding the castle packed with features including Free Spins. Land at least three to five scatters to gather six, eight, or 12 free spins. During the same game feature, players have the chance to enjoy several ways of winning when landing sticky wild or special symbols and unlocking even more features.</p>
<p>Fallen Angel and Wild Multipliers</p>
<p>When the Fallen Angel feature is triggered, players get to spot Wild symbols and Wild Multipliers adding extra value to the Sticky Wilds. The feature automatically adds a wild symbol on top of the first reel. The same wild symbol will then proceed to move down one position on each upcoming free spin until it eventually lands off the grid.</p>
<p>During the Symbol Upgrade feature, players will witness the lowest value monster symbols be turned into the Dio symbol. During the Lock up the Wolves feature, players can get their hands on ongoing Re-spins.</p>
<p>The company’s head of games Charlotte Miliziano spoke about the resounding success of their music series, explaining how fun it was to put together Dio’s story. Miliziano added that Play’n GO’s design team “really outdid themselves with the visual details.”</p>
<p>Dio was also used as a source of inspiration for Holy Diver Megaways, another rock-themed slot hit launched by Big Time Gaming three years ago. At the beginning of October, the company announced a partnership agreement with Italy’s Lottomatica, as part of its expansion plans in the region. The studio will also be present at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas between October 10-13.</p>
