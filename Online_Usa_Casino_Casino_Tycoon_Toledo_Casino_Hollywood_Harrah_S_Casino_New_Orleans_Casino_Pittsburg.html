<p>Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson is reportedly negotiating to buy a minority piece of the Las Vegas Raiders – for a record price. According to semafor.com, Johnson has been assembling a team of investors in recent weeks, and the price “could set a new record for sports deals, according to people familiar with the matter.”</p>

<p>News of Johnson’s interest comes after Forbes reported in August that the franchise and owner Mark Davis received an offer from “an unnamed investor” for a minority ownership stake, which had valued the team as being worth $6.5 billion – a price that would surpass recent purchases for ownership of the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers.</p>
<p>Forbes noted that minority stakes usually involve about 5% of a sports franchise, which confers no operational say in the team.</p>
<p>The Magic Touch</p>
<p>In 2012, Johnson led a group of investors that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers, in which he still owns a stake, for $2 billion. Johnson also holds minority stakes in the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA, the Los Angeles Football Club of MLS, and esports giant Team Liquid. He held a stake in the Lakers until 2010 and in the Dayton Dragons, a minor league baseball team, until 2014.</p>
<p>That record-setting Broncos purchase mentioned above? Its $4 billion price tag reportedly beat out an offer by an investment group with Johnson’s involvement in May 2022.</p>
<p>In non-sports ventures, Johnson is the majority owner of the EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, and built his reported $620 million net worth with investments in the Starbucks, Pepsi, and Burger King brands.</p>
<p>A History of Raiders Interest</p>
<p>Johnson previously expressed interest in owning a piece of the Raiders a decade ago when the franchise sought taxpayer money in order to build a new stadium in Oakland, Calif. Johnson was linked to a group seeking to bring the team back to LA, where it played from 1982 to 1994. That deal fell through.</p>
<p>Since their move to Las Vegas was announced in 2017, the Raiders jumped from the NFL’s 31st- most valuable team to its ninth. According to Forbes, their valuation increased from $2.1 billion in 2015 to $5.1 billion this year.</p>
<p>Johnson was one of the NBA’s best players, averaging 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game during his 13-year career. The 12-time All-Star also served as the Lakers’ president of basketball operations from 2017 to 2019, championing the push to acquire LeBron James in 2018.</p>
