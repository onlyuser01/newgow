<p>Go Bananza is a brand new 3x3 slot game that allows players to win huge monetary prizes by collecting bananas</p>
<p>Booming Games has released a new ape-themed slot, allowing players to join a bunch of furry friends in search of riches. The new game sports a thrilling gamble mechanic, allowing gamblers to multiply their bets.</p>
<p>Go Bananza Metrics:</p>
<p>Reels: 3</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Paylines: 10</p>
<p>RTP: 95.5%</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Max win: 2,000x</p>
<p>Collect Bananas for Huge Payouts</p>
<p>In a game of Go Bananza, players will spin the reels and collect various symbols. The 3×3 slot includes a bunch of cheerful monkeys in cool clothing, banana symbols, wild symbols, golden monkey mask scatters and multiple stick symbols.</p>
<p>Arranging the symbols in paylines will yield players various prizes. However, the symbols they should care the most about are the scatter golden monkeys and the banana symbols.</p>
<p>Collecting two or more bananas is sure to multiply a player’s bet. Collecting 9 of them in a single spin will yield 2,000x the bet, which is the biggest prize possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, collecting three scatter symbols will award 10 free spins to the players, launching a free spins mode, where they can collect additional bananas. Players shouldn’t worry about wasting the free spins since they can trigger them an unlimited number of times (provided they collect three scatter symbols).</p>
<p>If that doesn’t sound thrilling enough, Go Bananza also comes with a built-in gamble feature. After each winning spin, excluding free spins, players can choose whether to collect their prize or gamble it.</p>
<p>Players Can Take High Risks for High Rewards</p>
<p>If they choose not to gamble, their prize will be collected and the game will resume. If they choose to gamble, they will be presented with a hidden playing card. Players can either try to guess its color to multiply their winnings by two or try to guess its suit to multiply their winnings by four.</p>
<p>If the players fail to correctly guess, however, their entire winnings will be lost. Needless to say, this is a high-risk, high-reward mechanic for true slot connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Moritz Blume, Booming Games’ director of product, commented on the new release. He praised his team for the game, saying that it has “lively graphics, captivating animations and engaging bonuses.”</p>
<p>This exciting release lets players explore the jungle and team up with mischievous monkeys to potentially score up to 2000 times their bet. It’s games like Go Bananza that have established Booming Games as a highly sought-after provider for operators across global markets. Moritz Blume, director of product of Booming Games</p>
<p>Speaking of Booming Games, the studio just expanded its team, adding a new product owner and marketing manager.</p>
