    <h1>Tonkawa Hotel And Casino California Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino In Cincinnati Mgm Maryland</h1>

<p>The company confirmed that its current chief financial officer will step down from her role effective from the beginning of December</p>
<p>The owner and operator of NorthStarbets.ca, an online casino and sportsbook gaming platform in Ontario, NorthStar Gaming, unveiled future changes to its senior-level team. The company has announced that its current chief financial officer (CFO), Jennifer Barber, intends to step down from her role. The C-suite change is effective a month from now, starting from December 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Details on why Barber decided to step down from her role with NorthStar were scarce. Still, the company confirmed that once she steps down from her CFO role, she plans to pursue “another opportunity.” To fill in the vacant role, NorthStar confirmed it selected Chin Dhushenthen, one of its senior-level executives with extensive experience.</p>
<p>According to the company, once Barber steps down from her role, Dhushenthen, who currently serves as the company’s vice president, finance and compliance, will be appointed to the role of interim CFO. As interim CFO, he will oversee strategic financial processes and ensure the smooth transition to a new permanent CFO.</p>
<p>NorthStar did not disclose whether or not it has already started going through either internal or external applicants for the permanent CFO role. The company also did not disclose a timeframe on when it anticipates hiring a permanent CFO.</p>
<p>A Seasoned Executive Takes on the Role of Interim CFO</p>
<p>As interim CFO, Dhushenthen brings more than 25 years of executive-level experience within a wide range of verticals, including finance, risk management, technology and compliance. He initially joined NorthStar back in 2021 and since then played a key role in the development of the company’s financial reporting processes, as well as important functions related to regulatory reporting and compliance, among other strategic processes.</p>
<p>Outside of NorthStar, Dhushenthen held important senior-level roles with The Hunter Group, Azerty United Canada, as well as Hydrogenics Corporation. Before joining NorthStar Gaming, he was a part of the largest publicly traded provider of quality rental housing in Canada, CAPREIT. Overall, he was a part of the company for 13 years, holding important financial leadership roles.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank Jennifer for her contributions at an important time in our Company’s development.“ Michael Moskowitz, chair and CEO at NorthStar Gaming</p>
<p>Michael Moskowitz, NorthStar’s chair and CEO, thanked Barber for her dedication and hard work. He praised her experience which drove the company’s development. At the same time, Moskowitz outlined that Barber played an important role in strategic financial processes, including the acquisition of Slapshot Media. “We wish Jennifer the best as she moves into a financial leadership role in a new sector,” he added. Finally, Moskowitz said that NorthStar anticipates a smooth transition to Dhushenthen as an interim CFO.</p>
