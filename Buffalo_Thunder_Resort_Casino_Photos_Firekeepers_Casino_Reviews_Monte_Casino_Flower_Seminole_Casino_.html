    <h1>Buffalo Thunder Resort Casino Photos Firekeepers Casino Reviews Monte Casino Flower Seminole Casino</h1>

<p>Since March 13, I requested a withdrawal at Betway for 2000 euros and they sent me a message telling me that money was transferred to my account, which was not the case, I contacted customer service and they told me that I had to wait between 4 to 5 days to see the transference. On March 20, I returned to earn 15,154 euros and I retired without any problem. On March 22 I contact customer service again because the withdrawal of March 13 had not reached me and I was like that every day until March 31 that my account was closed without any explanation. To this day I keep asking about my withdrawals and they have not given me any answers. I have been with Betway for more than a year and I have never had problems with my withdrawals and I was very happy with that game house. I filed a complaint and still no one gives me an explanation for my withdrawals and why they closed my account. They owe me a total of 17,158 euros that I need them urgently and I have no answer. The truth is that I am very disappointed in the treatment they have given me and I did not expect this. To be faithful to a gambling house, depositing you have no problems but to withdraw what you have played there no one gives their face or gives you an answer.</p>
<p>More than 2 months have passed and no one has contacted me to tell me what happened and when they will pay me my withdrawals.</p>
