<p>A new partnership will see the largest land-based operator in New Zealand gain access to leading technology from White Hat, powering its online casino operations</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming, the leading iGaming platform and technology provider, powering the global betting and gaming sector, announced a new partnership, allowing it to significantly expand the reach of its technology. On Thursday, the company revealed it joined forces with the leading casino operator in New Zealand, Christchurch Casino. Under the terms of the new deal, White Hat agreed to supply its leading technology, powering the operator’s online casino.</p>
<p>As a result of the new partnership, Christchurch Casino’s iGaming offering will benefit from secure, safe and entertaining options. The iGaming platform provider agreed to deliver its cutting-edge player account management (PAM) platform that is powered by innovation and offers scalable functions. Additionally, Christchurch Casino’s online offering will benefit from White Hat’s solutions, including a proprietary cashier, 24/7 customer support, extensive payment options and CRM marketing support. The operator would also benefit from a wide range of player protection tools, strengthening its efforts within the responsible gambling vertical.</p>
<p>Another major advantage of the new partnership is the extensive range of casino games that will be supplied by White Hat. Per the new collaboration, the operator in New Zealand will gain access to more than 3,000 games from globally-recognized iGaming content providers. Such titles include slingo, live dealer, jackpots, table games and slots, among other thrilling games.</p>
<p>The partnership in New Zealand comes after White Hat announced another important deal recently. Late in August, the company signed a deal with Bally’s, enabling the operator to gain access to its market-leading PAM for the gambling market in Ohio. That deal saw Bally’s strengthen its offering, tapping into the innovative technology from White Hat.</p>
<p>The Partnership Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Keith O’Loughlin, Christchurch Casino’s executive chairman, said that the company is delighted to forge this new collaboration and gain access to quality services. According to him, White Hat was selected for the partnership as its leading products matched the company’s needs perfectly. “We’re delighted to be working alongside their team and offering players a best-in-class online casino offering,” he added. Finally, O’Loughlin acknowledged the benefits within the responsible gambling vertical brought by the new deal.</p>
<p>It was back in 1994 when Christchurch Casino started offering casino entertainment through its land-based venues. Since then, the operator has grown to a leadership position within the gambling sector in New Zealand. Now, thanks to the new deal with White Hat, Christchurch Casino is expected to propel its online gambling operations.</p>
<p>“We are delighted that White Hat Gaming is partnering with Christchurch Casino as they begin their journey within the online gambling environment, we share the highest standard in providing a responsible and enjoyable experience for the end-users.“ Phillip Gelvan, CEO at White Hat Gaming</p>
<p>Phillip Gelvan, White Hat’s CEO, added that the company is excited to team up with Christchurch Casino and power their entry into the online gambling vertical. He said that White Hat’s innovative technology and services ensure fun and responsible experiences. Finally, Gelvan explained that the company is excited to support the growth of the biggest land-based operator in New Zealand.</p>
