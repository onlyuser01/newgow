    <h1>Casino In New York Casino In Canada Montreal Catawba Casino Casinos In Shreveport Louisiana Lumiere</h1>

<p>ACMA has issued its latest blocking order against two casino and sports betting websites, to name Las Atlantis and Cloudbet. ACMA, which stands for the Australian Communications and Media Authority, has been looking to actively restrict the access of unlicensed websites to citizens.</p>
<p>There have been a number of enforcement actions, most recently in September, when the regulator suspended Zenith Slots, Bizzo Casino, Spin Oasis, and a number of other websites. A total of 15 offshore gambling websites were targeted in September, making the latest enforcement action small by comparison.</p>
<p>ACMA similarly targeted seven websites that were in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 back in August, and it has been seeking to actively suspend any offender. With the latest move, ACMA has been able to successful restrict the access of 619 unauthorizedgambling websites. All of them are in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act which explicitly states that in order to operate, an entity must hold a license from a local regulatory authority.</p>
<p>ACMA is not specifically tasked with issuing licenses, but it has been able to work through ISPs to make sure that consumers in the country are protected. Another success for the regulator has been the fact that ACMA managed to drive some 180-odd websites outside of Australia.</p>
<p>The regulator threatened these brands that it would file complaints with their regulating authorities overseas. This proved a strong incentive for many who decided to fold their business operations and withdraw from the market. Regardless, Australia still remains an important market for many gambling websites that continue to operate in a predatory way.</p>
<p>They do not have a license that binds them to responsible gambling, and even though most promote such materials on their website, there is no obligation to follow through. ACMA has urged consumers to signal the regulator so that the watchdog can be more efficient as it seeks to completely limit the reach of such websites.</p>
<p>Despite the hundreds of bans, there are still many websites that remain to be suspended. ACMA, though, needs to follow protocol and place requests with ISPs to have illegal gambling websites targeted. As ACMA fights the good fight online, many states have began tightening the measures they use in land-based facilities in order to protect consumers.</p>
<p>NSW has recently announced the start of facial recognition software to be introduced to pubs and bars in a bid to ensure that vulnerable gamblers are protected. Cashless payment technology is also on the way to address issues such as AML failings.</p>
