    <h1>Casino Slots Near Me Black And Mild Casino River Spirit Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Golden Nugget Casino M</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>does anyone have experience with Spinrio Casino?</p>
<p>At first I was positively surprised, the design is beautiful - everything is nicely arranged and lots of games. Now I start to doubt something because this is what happened.</p>
<p>I won a small sum and then I uploaded all the documents to verify myself. Since then it says:</p>
<p>"Congratulations your documents have been approved! You may be asked to upload extra documents at a later stage. Thank you!</p>
<p>When??!!</p>
<p>I thought, well ... they might check something else and so I played a little more. While playing the Shake Shake Leprechaun game, I won free games and a nice sum too. I was so happy and recorded everything with my cell phone - thought I can upload it and report on my luck.</p>
<p>I played, then a little (other games too) and logged out. After logging in again, I keep getting the message that the Shake Shake game is not closed and that I should do so. But it doesn't work!</p>
<p>In the chat I was told that they have to check and will get in touch.</p>
<p>Well, now I'm slowly wondering what the whole thing is about or whether this is not a delaying tactic - but I don't want to impute anything to anyone.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has a good rating on Spinrio - that's why I registered there.</p>
<p>LG</p>
