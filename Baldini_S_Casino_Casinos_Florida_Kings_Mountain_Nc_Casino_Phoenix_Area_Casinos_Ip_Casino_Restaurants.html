<p>Information about Inpay casinos</p>
<p>Inpay is an online cross-border payment provider that markets itself as an alternative to SWIFT transfers and credit cards. Its products are an instant international payment service and PostalCheque, a postal money order solution.</p>
<p>The service operates in over 100 countries, so you may well have come across its logo while browsing online. Some internet casinos accept Inpay deposits, and this page is here to help you find the best Inpay casinos.</p>
<p>Continue reading to find out how to make an Inpay casino deposit, which Inpay sites offer bonuses, and also gain some background on the company behind this payment solution.</p>

<p>Inpay: a fast-growing payment method with big plans</p>
<p>There's an old English expression that says 'necessity is the mother of invention'. This is certainly the case when it comes to Inpay and its founder Jacob Tackmann Thomsen.</p>
<p>After the worst cyclone in Myanmar's history devastated the country in 2008, Tackmann Thomsen felt compelled to help. He went online to make a donation to the thousands of orphaned children there, but was shocked to discover that his payment would lose 5% to fees and take several days to arrive.</p>
<p>Determined to get all of the money to where it was needed, he set about finding a way to make cross-border payments cheap and quick, and Inpay was the product of his search.</p>
<p>Starting out as an office in Copenhagen, the start-up quickly grew into one of Denmark's top payment methods, and the firm opened a second office in London as it looked to expand internationally. Tackmann Thomsen had timed it just right: his idea allowed him to tap into the online payment industry that was about to start booming.</p>
<p>In 2018, Inpay acquired Eurogiro, a global payment community for postal operators that broadened the start-up's service offerings. The Financial Times named it one of the fastest-growing companies in Europe in 2021 after it processed several millions of transactions that year.</p>
<p>Along with Eurogiro, Inpay is targeting a customer base of 100 million people by 2030 — a figure that would put it among the most successful payment methods in the world.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Inpay</p>
<p>Inpay looks the part with its smooth, modern website and rapidly growing customer base, but how does its service measure up?</p>
<p>Well, the most important aspect of any bank transfer is security. We want to be 100% sure that our money will arrive at its intended destination when we want it to. Inpay scores highly on this front. It follows stringent fraud detection measures, is regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), and is an EU-recognized institution. There are also no user complaints online about Inpay's service, which suggests that it is held in high regard by its customers.</p>
<p>Inpay also places great emphasis on transaction speeds. Its website claims a typical time of just minutes, which beats traditional bank transfers, but it is about normal for modern digital methods. Still, you can expect a quick transfer once you've completed the payment details.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, the only information we could find on the site was that it costs less than a wire transfer, which isn't saying much. That said, payment methods like this are often cheap, if not free, for users, because they use a single integration method. This involves having partner accounts in each country rather than transferring the funds and then converting them into the local currency.</p>
<p>Inpay has a large network of participating banks, but if your bank isn't part of it, then you won't be able to use the service. This is an obvious downside compared to more widely available methods like PayPal. It's also unavailable in the United States, one of the largest consumer markets in the world.</p>
<p>Finding the best Inpay casino for you</p>
<p>One of the reasons you're using this site is to find the best online casinos, right? After all, if you can't trust the casino, then Inpay could be the best payment method in the world, but your money would still be at risk.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has made the casino search process a whole lot easier by assessing sites in its database to check whether they are up to scratch. To do this, our team of experts awards a Safety Index based on performance factors like the number of complaints the casino has received and how likely it is to pay out big wins. By using this page's filters, you can find which sites suit your preferences.</p>
<p>Starting off with the 'All' tab: when you're on the 'All' tab and the 'Inpay' filter is selected, you'll have the full list of Inpay casinos in front of you. We believe you should start with the best of these, so select the 'Recommended' tab to see those sites with the highest Safety Index.</p>
<p>Alternatively, choose the 'Newly opened' filter to see the newest Inpay-friendly offerings on our system – new casinos often have some nice welcoming offers as they try and make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Note: There are a host of other filters that will help you refine your search further. If you'd like to find Inpay casinos with games from your favorite provider, then go to the 'Game provider' filter and select it from the list there. For Habanero casinos, for example, just tick its dedicated box. You can also sort the casinos by currency, language, or even a second payment method if you like.</p>
<p>How to use Inpay in online casinos</p>
<p>Once you've found your ideal Inpay casino, then that's the hard part out of the way. Making a deposit is simple, and you should have funds in your casino account within minutes if you follow these steps:</p>
<p>Once your casino account has been opened, head to the site's cashier and choose 'Inpay' from the list of payment options in the Deposits section. In the pop-up window, enter your bank account details and how much you'd like to deposit. Remember to double-check these figures as the payment will be rejected if anything is incorrect. Click confirm.</p>
<p>The funds should appear in your casino balance within minutes, but sometimes it may take a little longer. If you find yourself waiting more than a couple of hours, then it might be a good idea to check with the casino and/or your bank to confirm that everything has gone through OK.</p>
<p>Note: One downside to Inpay's service is that it doesn't process casino withdrawals, so you'll have to use another payment method to get hold of your funds.</p>
<p>Inpay casino bonuses</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses are a nice way to get to know a new site and how it works. It's fairly common for a casino to give new players a deposit bonus after transferring money into their accounts for the first time, or even a no deposit bonus that is awarded just for signing up.</p>
<p>To find those Inpay casinos that offer bonuses, head to our list of casino bonuses and pick the 'Inpay' filter. You'll see a list of relevant offers which you can narrow down further. To see only deposit bonuses, for example, then choose 'Deposit Bonus' in the 'Bonus Type' section. Alternatively, head to our list of deposit bonuses and select the 'Inpay' filter there.</p>
<p>Be aware that all of these bonuses should be relevant as of the date of your search as the Casino Guru team works hard to keep them up to date.</p>
