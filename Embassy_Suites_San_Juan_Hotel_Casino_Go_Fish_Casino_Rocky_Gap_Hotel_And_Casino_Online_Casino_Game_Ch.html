<p>Religiously observant Jewish tourists will soon have two new options in Hollywood, Fla. In the works are two kosher diet hotels located near a well-known tribal gaming property: the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>

<p>The Wyndham Dolce is scheduled to open next October. It will be located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>It will include 100 guest rooms. It will also have a kosher rooftop restaurant. Room service will be offered via a robot. Construction started in June by BSD Capital LLC of Boca Raton.</p>
<p>The hotel will cater to kosher tourists and feature accommodations for Jewish religious rules.</p>
<p>Another kosher hotel is in the works to open in 2024.</p>
<p>Hotel to Feature Sabbath Elevator</p>
<p>The property will also feature an elevator that complies with Jewish Sabbath rules. Observers of the Sabbath cannot use electricity from Friday to Saturday night,</p>
<p>The Sabbath elevator will stop on every floor of the hotel automatically. Visitors will not be required to press buttons.</p>
<p>The firm also is expecting to begin construction on a second kosher hotel next year located nearby. It is to be part of the Wyndham Grand brand.</p>
<p>When complete, it will provide 200 rooms, as well as 64 condos that can be rented.</p>
<p>Many Observant Jews in Hollywood</p>
<p>When asked about the project, Jewish Theological Seminary historian Jack Wertheimer told Casino.org the Seminole casino is near a large Orthodox Jewish enclave in Hollywood, Florida.</p>

<p>“That means there is an infrastructure of Jewish institutions nearby, such as synagogues, kosher restaurants, and take-out food places, as well as places to spend some time studying Jewish texts,” Wertheimer explained.</p>
<p>However, gambling has traditionally been frowned upon by some Jewish religious authorities, so Wertheimer is doubtful similar kosher developments will take off in other gambling meccas.</p>
<p>I’m dubious that Las Vegas would offer the same attraction for Orthodox Jews–or Atlantic City,” Wertheimer said. But other types of travel destinations could lure kosher travelers.</p>
<p>But Wertheimer says that there is a growing demographic of affluent Orthodox that are looking for vacation spots that cater to their needs and that would be interested in sites such as these.</p>
<p>Nora L. Rubel, chair of the University of Rochester’s Department of Religion &amp; Classics, also has seen a similar trend.</p>
<p>Rubel operates a kosher-style vegetarian restaurant in Rochester, N.Y. with her husband. She told Casino.org she’s seen a growing market for kosher hotels in all sorts of settings. She added there are limited travel options for them outside of organized tours.</p>
<p>“Jews who keep kosher — in non-kosher settings — often choose to adhere to a vegetarian diet in order to avoid dietary transgressions. But there are many Orthodox Jews who won’t even do that, so hotels that are actually under kosher supervision will be attractive to that demographic,” Rubel said.</p>
