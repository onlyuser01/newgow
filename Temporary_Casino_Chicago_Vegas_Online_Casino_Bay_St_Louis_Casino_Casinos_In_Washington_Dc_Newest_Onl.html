    <h1>Temporary Casino Chicago Vegas Online Casino Bay St Louis Casino Casinos In Washington Dc Newest Onl</h1>

<p>my favorite provider was microgaming for a long time but things things are getting worse and worse there as well and since they started to replace the old flash games with the mobile version of many games, it's over. i guess that this should only be a temporary solution and microgaming is to program the html5 variants of the games because the mobile versions of the games such as "immortal romance", "playboy" or "thunderstruck II" are so terrible.</p>
<p>after 2 years the profits from the big well-known providers became less and less, so i looked around for alternatives and at the moment i like to play games from multislot and world match, the asian providers dreamtech, spadegaming and ganapati. playtech also has some good games. the worst provider for me are definitively play n go, yggdrasil, nextgen, pariplay, netent, rtg only to name a few. since play n go start offering their games to the casinos with a variable RTP that goes down to 84.18% i stopped playing their games and because of the high variance of most play n go slots. netent is on my no go list because of the crapy releases for more then 1,5 years now.</p>
