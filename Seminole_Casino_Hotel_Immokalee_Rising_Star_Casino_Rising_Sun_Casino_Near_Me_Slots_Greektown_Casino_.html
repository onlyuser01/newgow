<p>Following the conclusion of the limited period, the solution will be made available to all of White Hat Studios’ partnering operators</p>
<p>White Hat Studios has released a brand-new promotional tool called Win Spins. For a while, the solution will be exclusively available with BetMGM, allowing its customers to be the first ones to try it out.</p>
<p>Win Spins has been designed to provide a huge boost to the customer experience as it guarantees the amount of Win Spins up front. This feature eliminates the disappointment of low winning free sins and zero wins that some slots players experience from time to time.</p>
<p>The solution is available within a pre-selected range of White Hat Studios’ slot games, allowing players to continually spin until they have achieved the number of winning spins they have been assigned as part of the promotional offer.</p>
<p>The new solution is expected to provide White Hat Studios’ operator partners with improved customer acquisition and retention rates. This would further cement the studio as a leading and reliable developer of cutting-edge iGaming content and solutions.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Win Spins will be exclusively available to BetMGM customers at first, solidifying the gambling giant as a leading industry innovator. Following the conclusion of this limited period, the solution will be made available to all of White Hat Studios’ partnering operators.</p>
<p>White Hat Wants to Drive Innovation in iGaming</p>
<p>White Hat Studios’ vice president of gaming, Armen Tatarevic, commented on the newly launched solution, saying that it will change how players perceive promotions and rewards. He believes that the US iGaming market has been lagging behind the online sports betting sector, which has been driven by innovation and fierce bonusing competition.</p>
<p>Because of that, White Hat Studios continues its efforts to change iGaming and make it more entertaining to customers.</p>
<p>By introducing Win Spins, we are modernizing the way in which players receive promotional rewards and making them far more enjoyable. We’re excited to have launched Win Spins initially with BetMGM and we have seen fantastic player engagement from the initial campaigns. Armen Tatarevic, VP of gaming, White Hat Studios</p>
<p>In other news, White Hat Gaming recently launched its PAM system in New York with Bally’s Entertainment, expanding its existing alliance with the American gambling giant. This was the sixth rollout with the cooperation in several months and followed the success of similar rollouts in Colorado, Virginia, Arizona, Indiana, and Ohio.</p>
