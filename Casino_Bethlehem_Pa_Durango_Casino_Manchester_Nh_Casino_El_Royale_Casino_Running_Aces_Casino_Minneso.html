<p>ESA adds Abacus3 as marketing partnership</p>
<p>Abacus3 will seek to scale fan-investor interaction globally</p>
<p>Arlington to be pivotal for esports for years to come</p>
<p>The Esports Stadium Arlington has added Abacus3 to help with marketing efforts and connecting investors with new audiences.</p>
<p>ESA Signs with Abacus3 to Expand Reach</p>
<p>The Esports Stadium Arlington (ESA) is seeking to expand its footprint by adding marketing specialist Abacus3 onboard. Though the collaboration, the esports venue hopes to raise its profile and win new investment and hosting opportunities.</p>
<p>Excited to announce our partnership with @Abacus3_ . They'll be taking lead on our naming rights and sponsorship opportunities for @EsportsStadium. The folks on this team are some of the best in the business.https://t.co/YUtRklCYJX — Jonathon Oudthone (@solidxpanda) June 4, 2019</p>
<p>In particular, ESA will be focusing on building esports communities, a move that is aligned with the stated goals of investors in the property. ESA president Jonathon Oudthone didn’t miss an opportunity to praise Abacus3 for their expertise:</p>
<p>We selected Abacus3 because of their team’s rich history in sponsorship and community building. They understand that what benefits the fan ultimately benefits the brand.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on a $10-million investment, ESA sprawls on 100,000 sq ft imagined by the creative minds at Populous. The venue arrived in November, 2018 and has already served as a host to several high-profile esports events, including the FACEIT Esports Championship Series (ECS).</p>
<p>Similarly, the event played host to the Collegiate Rocket League National Championship amid the increasing significance of competitive video gaming on the collegiate level.</p>
<p>Commenting further on the venue in light of the newest partnership, Oudthone didn’t forget to point out the importance of the venue:</p>
<p>We take pride in being the largest, most turnkey dedicated esports facility in North America. We are the hub for community events large and small year round. Our sponsors want to make a meaningful impact on the esports and gaming community.</p>
<p>Abacus3 CEO Greg Skasko also used the opportunity to comment on the partnership noting the engagement between local audience at the venue and sponsors.</p>
<p>Skasko called this relationship a unique opportunity and pointed out that it could be easily scaled to feature a national or even international audience. According to Sasko, the location of Arlington is of particular significance to the future success of the property.</p>
<p>Esports Arena Spread the U.S.</p>
<p>Esports arenas will spread across the united states. Last year, South Korean broadcast company OGN invested in the PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds North American League.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Full Sail University released its own esports arena better known as “The Fortress”. The Fortress is supposedly the largest esports venue a college has rolled out in North America to date.</p>
<p>Another notable mention is the 30,000 sq ft HyperX Las Vegas Esports Arena, which hosts both esports and poker events.</p>

<p>The Overwatch League (OWL) hosted by Blizzard has been another big motivator for the arrival of esports real estate.</p>
<p>With its city-based model OWL is yet to inspire more localized esports that will resemble today’s big sporting events, similar to the NBA and NFL.</p>
