<p>Network Gaming has inked FIFA World Cup-oriented partnerships with four different sports media companies. The developer wants to capitalize on the opportunities during the famous sports event and expand its reach.</p>
<p>Network Gaming Inked Four New Partnerships</p>
<p>The four companies Network Gaming joined forces with are 101 Great Goals, At the Races, Planet Sport and WhoScored.com. Per the agreements, Network Gaming and its new partners will launch new betting products and will promote the developer’s proprietary World Cup Tournament Survivor offering.</p>
<p>101 Great Goals is a soccer-centered broadcasting and betting advice website owned by XLMedia. At The Races is the company behind Sky Sports’ Racing TV channel. While a predominantly racing brand, At The Races will support Network Gaming during the World Cup. Planet Sport is a media and business-to-business tech specialist that will help Network Gaming through its publishing brands and B2B services. Lastly, WhoScored is a site that brings fans data, match results and ratings from the most popular soccer leagues in the world.</p>
<p>The Media Companies Are Happy to Work with Network Gaming</p>
<p>Despite being a horse racing platform, At The Races is excited to join Network Gaming and promote other sports as well. The company’s director of new media and innovation, Matthew Taylor, said that he is certain that many of the brand’s fans are not exclusively interested in equine sports. Taylor noted that At The Races has previously given editorial coverage to such tournaments and is now excited to “add another level of participation.”</p>
<p>The World Cup transcends traditional boundaries and we have historically devoted significant editorial coverage for tournaments but this year we also wanted an extra layer of engagement. Matthew Tylor, director of new media and innovation, At The Races</p>
<p>Tylor is certain that players of Network Gaming’s World Cup-themed games are going to be very clever, skillful and lucky to rise above their competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thomas Rooney, XLMedia’s director of European sports, is by the opportunity to engage soccer fans with great content during this year’s World Cup event. He noted that many sports enthusiasts are sure to follow the competition online. Rooney added that he is thrilled to join forces with Network Gaming and hopes that this would be the start of a long and successful collaboration.</p>
<p>Planet Sport’s managing director of betting, Mike Grenham, also spoke on his company’s agreement with Network Gaming. He said that the whole content integration process has been very smooth and a delight for Planet Sport’s team. Grenham is sure that his company’s customers are going to adore Network Gaming’s titles.</p>
