    <h1>Illinois Casino Barton S Club 93 Casino Hotel Jackpot Casino In Canada Are There Casinos In Florida</h1>

<p>Online betting and gaming operator, Novibet, announced today it has reached an agreement to become the Official Betting Partner of the 2023 Tattersalls Irish Guineas Festival.</p>
<p>Three Days of Horse Racing</p>
<p>Under the sponsorship agreement, Novibet would be named sponsor of six of the races that would take place during the last weekend of May at The Curragh Racecourse in Ireland. The deal is the biggest-ever sponsorship of a horse racing event for the European gaming operator.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be named as the Official Betting Partner of this year’s Irish Guineas Festival in what is the biggest horse racing sponsorship we’ve been involved with so far,” said Karl Riley, country manager for Ireland at Novibet.</p>
<p>The three days of horse racing festival between May 26 and May 28 is one of the biggest events in Irish Flat racing and Novibet’s sponsorship will increase the presence of the operator among fans of horse racing in Ireland and the UK.</p>
<p>The Tattersalls Irish Guineas Festival is considered as one of the most prestigious events in the international racing calendar. Among the races sponsored by Novibet will be the Novibet Emerald Mile which will feature on the opening day of the festival, and the Novibet Guineas Festival Premier Handicap on Saturday.</p>
<p>Raise Profile, Attract New Audiences</p>
<p>“We are very excited that Novibet has selected The Curragh to launch their biggest horse racing partnership to date,” said the manager for Racing and Sponsorships at The Curragh Racecourse, Evan Arkwright.</p>
<p>“… we will work closely with their team to ensure they maximize all opportunities to raise their profile across the extensive global audience that the Tattersalls Irish Guineas Festival attracts throughout all three days,” he added.</p>
<p>The sponsorship of the 2023 Tattersalls Irish Guineas Festival would further popularize the sports betting and gaming operator which is the active sponsor of recently crowned three-times British Champion Jump Jockey, Brian Hughes.</p>
<p>Focused on regulated European gaming and betting markets, Novibet has recently considered markets on the side of the Atlantic, following the partnerships with US entertainment giant Caesars Entertainment to market access in New Jersey, and Big Bola Casinos in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Malta-based operator launched its online offering in Mexico in November – just in time for the 2022 FIFA World Cup event in Qatar. Following its Mexican launch, Novibet boosted its visibility and presence in another Latin American jurisdiction, Brazil, by becoming the primary sponsor of Fortaleza in March.</p>
