    <h1>Casino Casinos Near Me Jackpot Casino California Hotel Casino Casino Jobs Las Vegas Is Chumba Casino</h1>

<p>A system created in 2018 that allows players to establish a credit line and access the funds directly at a slot machine with their rewards card is about to debut at Morongo in Cabazon, California. Marker Trax was created by Gary Ellis and has been testing at an off-Strip small casino on Koval Lane, looking to roll it nationwide.</p>
<p>First Cashless Tribal Casino in California</p>
<p>The Morongo Casino and Resort, run by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, is set to become the first tribal gaming establishment in California to go cashless and offer wagering markers to its customers. Initially, only the most trustworthy of the casino’s slot players will be able to take advantage of the Marker Trax system, to allow the casino to monitor and trace transactions.</p>
<p>“A number of years ago, back when we were just a slot house, I remember a guy came to the cage and drew on his line of credit. I watched him take the $1,000 in cash and walk right out the door. That’s kind of where the idea came from.” Gary Ellis, Owner, Marker Trax</p>
<p>Gary Ellis further noted the new credit line system could be used basically across the board in terms of the different casino games, and that his company already approached the biggest US casino operators, having between 30 and 40 casinos already signed up for it.</p>
<p>With operations at Marker Trax led by former International Game Technology (IGT) employee Charlie Skinner, the new system is gathering the attention nationwide as it significantly reduces the credit application time and cuts on paperwork.</p>
<p>A player can get a credit line in as little as 5 minutes, Skinner outlined, comparing to the hours or even days needed traditionally. Marker Trax even undertakes casinos’ responsibilities for monitoring individual player accounts, handling the billing and collection processes on their behalf, Skinner added.</p>
<p>The innovative credit line system partnered with slot maker Konami Gaming to roll its first trials at Ellis Island, and was welcomed by players such as D’Ante Garner, a member of Ellis Island’s Passport player’s club, who hailed it eliminated the need for an ATM.</p>
<p>Marker Trax is also gaining popularity in a period when there is a wide push towards cashless and touchless payment options across the board, and most of the casinos that were already approached by the company regarding a possible launch of the system confirmed plans to introduce some form of cashless systems inside their gaming properties, Skinner concluded.</p>
