<p>The Entain Foundation has announced that it will financially support the Alumni Project of Gordon Moody, a UK-based charity that focuses on the treatment of gambling addiction. The Foundation is set up as a not-for-profit organization by Entain and is aiming to back various initiatives that seek to reduce gambling-related harm and addiction.</p>
<p>The Alumni Project by Gordon Moody seeks to achieve just that. The program is designed by the charity and it will run over the next two years, where former problem gamblers who have received successful treatment by the organization would now assist others who may be seeking help, or who have recently finished treatment.</p>
<p>Gordon Moody has set up the project as a peer mentor program that is designed to ensure ongoing supervision and that newly-treated patients stay on the right path. Alumni will be offered a variety of part-time and full-time paid positions to help spearhead Gordon Moody’s ongoing efforts to leverage the lived experiences of recovered gambling addicts and help others.</p>
<p>Entain Chairman Barry Gibson has welcomed the opportunity to be funding the charity and offers more financial help. Entain and Gordon Moody have been working together for years now, Gibson noted.</p>
<p>He explained that the present funding was just the latest round of financial aid Entain was offering to treatment and addiction prevention campaigns and companies, including £40m that has already been voluntarily donated to GambleAware, a prominent charity that tackles addiction in England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>
<p>Gibson hailed Gordon Moody’s new initiative further noting that this is the first case where people who have completed their treatment would be able to offer hands-on help to those who are only now beginning to seek help.</p>
<p>The Entain Foundation has confirmed that it’s prepared to fund the project in the first two years, at a cost of roughly £740,000, with a launch date set for April and the campaign overseen by Gordon Moody’s Head of Service Development, Clinical Director and the Clinical Governance Committee, part of Gordon Moody.</p>
<p>The charity’s chief executive, Matthew Hickey, was similarly pleased with the support that the Entain Foundation has shown for the campaign.</p>
<p>"The Alumni Project will help Gordon Moody reach more people who need our support by putting the voice of lived experience at the heart of both our engagement and residential services," Hickey said. He called the support from Entain crucial for the charity to grow its services and help those who need treatment and support.</p>
