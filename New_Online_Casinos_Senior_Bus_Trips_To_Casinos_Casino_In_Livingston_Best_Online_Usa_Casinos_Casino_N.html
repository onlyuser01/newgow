    <h1>New Online Casinos Senior Bus Trips To Casinos Casino In Livingston Best Online Usa Casinos Casino N</h1>

<p>The provider of quality casino games, powering iGaming operators across the globe, Pragmatic Play, announced it inked a new content agreement. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with Niké, a leading Slovakian gambling operator. Under the terms of the new agreement, Pragmatic agreed to supply the operator with products from its slots portfolio.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recently forged agreement, Niké’s players will be able to experience thrilling slots from the leading iGaming provider. As a result, new customers are going to be able to access Pragmatic’s recent hits like Cash Chips and Tundra’s Fortune. Moreover, the collaboration includes player-favorite and popular titles from the iGaming supplier such as Gates of Olympus and Sugar Rush, among other games.</p>
<p>Currently, Pragmatic Play develops up to eight new slot titles per month. The company has solidified its presence as a leading provider for the iGaming vertical, delivering not only slots but virtual sports, bingo and live casino products. Pragmatic’s multi-product portfolio is available through a single API, making them suitable for operators who want to quickly expand their offering and deliver unrivaled experiences for their customers.</p>
<p>The content deal brought excitement for Niké with a representative explaining that the addition of games from Pragmatic marked a milestone achievement for the company. Moreover, the representative explained: “It has gained an enviable reputation for delivering some of the industry’s most entertaining experiences and opening those opportunities up to our player base heralds the beginning of a fantastic collaboration.”</p>
<p>The iGaming Content Provider Continues to Grow across Europe</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s COO, was similarly thrilled regarding the freshly minted agreement with the prominent Slovakian operator. She explained that the company continues to expand its presence in strategic markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Moreover, Cornides pointed out that the deal with Niké in Slovakia helps Pragmatic’s products engage with new players. Finally, she said: “We look forward to a great partnership with Niké as it continues to strengthen its offering as a top operator in the market.”</p>
<p>“Pragmatic Play continues to expand in regulated markets and partnering with major operators like Niké in Slovakia provides a great opportunity for us to deliver our rich portfolio of games to even more players.“ Irina Cornides, COO at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>The new deal with Niké in Slovakia comes on the heels of Pragmatic’s recent partnership with DAZN BET. Earlier this month, the company agreed to supply its sportsbook product, powering DAZN BET’s operations in Spain. That deal marked an important achievement for Pragmatic as it propelled its presence in Europe. Besides its sportsbook product, DAZN BET tapped into Pragmatic’s full-service iGaming solution.</p>
