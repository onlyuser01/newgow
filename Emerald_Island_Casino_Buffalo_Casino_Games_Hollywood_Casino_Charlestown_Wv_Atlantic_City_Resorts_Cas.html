    <h1>Emerald Island Casino Buffalo Casino Games Hollywood Casino Charlestown Wv Atlantic City Resorts Cas</h1>

<p>Dear Casinoguru team,</p>
<p>Yesterday I've made a deposit of 50€ at Bambet Casino, I've read the bonus terms and everything looked good. Tried to use their 100% welcome bonus.</p>
<p>After the deposit I saw, that only 4 games are available to play with bonus money. This is nowhere to be found in the bonus terms and conditions.</p>
<p>After contacting the support I've got the following message:</p>
<p>"you can always cancel your bonus if you do not like the conditions"</p>
<p>I've also made screenshots of the bonus terms, in case they change it.</p>
<p>After 2 hours arguing with the chat, i canceled the bonus and requested my withdrawal as the casino support team assured me to withdraw my money (after they admitted that the bonus terms are really wrong)</p>
<p>They even sent me a mail where they've asked for all my details:</p>
<p>I've then made the withdrawal on the casino site.</p>
<p>Well, after a few hours I got another mail, that I must wager the deposit 3 times, although they've promised me to withdraw my deposit because of unfair bonus terms</p>
<p>These practices are really disgusting. There is a system of cheating here. On the one hand, they lure players with a 100% bonus where nowhere in the terms does it say that this is limited to 4 games. Then they hope, on the one hand, that the player still gambles away his money. After hours of back and forth with support, they promise a payout, which they then cancel again hoping you're gambling away your money.</p>
<p>Can you please help me, the 50€ are still on my balance because I don't intend to play in a casino which scams people like that.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
