<p>Evoplay has doubled down on its presence in the Italian market through a new tie-up with a content aggregator</p>
<p>The collaboration with Tuko Productions, a leading aggregator and online slots provider of its own, will help Evoplay to quickly and reliably deploys its products with leading local brands. Italy has been an important focus of many suppliers’ most recent efforts, with companies queuing up to secure a strong presence in the market.</p>
<p>Jumpstarting Evoplay’s Further Expansion in Italy</p>
<p>Through this link-up with Tuko Productions, Evoplay will be able to deploy its vast array of original gaming content with a number of companies that are currently working with Tuko Productions, including but not limited to Snai, Sisal, Lottomatica and Goldbet.</p>
<p>Integrations with targeted local operators will be facilitated by the aggregator’s dedicated platform, Tuko Hub Production which makes the injection of fresh content on large scale simple and straightforward. The partnership concerns the full portfolio of games that will now debut with Tuko’s partner operators in Italy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Evoplay has a lot to offer all on its own, bringing around games such as Book of the Priestess and Perfect Fishing amongst some of the company’s most popular titles. Evoplay has been a force in the Italian market as well. The company only obtained its supplier license in May 2022, but it has already been spinning its wheels to secure a bigger market share as it goes along.</p>
<p>The company has been able to negotiate individual product launches with Scommettendo and Sportbet, two big local brands, and will now only add to its ranks with Tuko’s partner operators. Commenting on the recent developments, Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi noted:</p>
<p>Tuko is an expert in the Italian market, and we trust their ideas and thank them for the support. We are thrilled to sign a deal with a company that embodies our forward-thinking approach. Evoplay CCO Vladimir Malakchi</p>
<p>Evoplay a Worthwhile Addition to Tuko’s Product Offering</p>
<p>Malakchi confirmed that he was pleased to see Evoplay’s portfolio of games launch on the Italian market with ever more brands. He also teased that there is a new revolutionary product rollout coming later in the year for Evoplay.</p>
<p>Tuko Productions sales director Vincenzo Tancredi was similarly pleased with the development and hailed the significance of adding Evoplay’s portfolio to its library. Evoplay, said Tancredi, brings products that appeal to a wide variety of demographics.</p>
<p>“The diversity of Evoplay’s superior product suite is especially appealing and we look forward to working with our new partner,” Tancredi concluded.</p>
