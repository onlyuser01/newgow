<p>Tipico has renewed its partnership with Bundesliga soccer powerhouse Bayern Munich and will continue to collaborate with the club through 2025.</p>
<p>Sportsbook Tipico Strengthens Positions in Germany with Bayern Partnership</p>
<p>Tipico will continue to pursue stronger ties with local sports franchises in Germany as the company has renewed its partnership with Bundesliga’s FC Bayern Munich. Through the partnership, Tipico will be able to continue collaborating with the soccer club on various marketing opportunities and create tailored content for sports fans.</p>
<p>This deal is a continuation of a five-year deal originally signed back in 2015 and the period of the new partnership puts the companies together as partners well through 2025.</p>
<p>The collaboration was welcomed by Tipico CCO Marlon van der Goes who argued that by continuing to build on this relationship, the company was demonstrating its unfaltering dedication to improving itself.</p>
<p>Tipico’s track record for creating meaningful partnerships is well-established with the company tasking Fade The Noise with the sportsbook’s marketing campaign in the United States.</p>
<p>Marlon drew parallels between the company’s business strategy and Bayern Munich’s own commitment to success, arguing that the organizations shared the same passion and desire to win.</p>
<p>“The extension of our trusted partnership is a very clear commitment to these shared values, and we are very happy about it,” van der Goes added.</p>
<p>A Big Player in a Big Market</p>
<p>Tipico is the dominant name in the German sports betting landscape and intends to remain a bidding player in the newly-regulated climate. By one estimate, Tipico owns half of the entire betting market in Germany and strategic partnership with sports teams helps consolidate the company’s standing in the country.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge welcomed the partnership and said he was looking forward to another successful spell. “Tipico is the market leader in its field, and we at FC Bayern are always interested in working with the best in their respective industries. It is our ambition to always be number one – and this partner fits that bill,” Rummenigge added.</p>
<p>Tipico has been involved in many consumer-focused initiatives of late. Apart from expanding across the pond in New Jersey, the company has worked painstakingly to boost customer satisfaction and overall product sustainability.</p>
