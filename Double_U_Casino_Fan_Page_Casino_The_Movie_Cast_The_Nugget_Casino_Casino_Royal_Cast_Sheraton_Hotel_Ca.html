    <h1>Double U Casino Fan Page Casino The Movie Cast The Nugget Casino Casino Royal Cast Sheraton Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>On March 17, I won a jackpot playing Legends of Avalon. This jackpot was won using a deposit I made with usd via credit or debit card. The total amount in my bank after winning the jackpot, was $354,848.81. I attempted to withdraw, but could not do so via bitcoin. When I spoke with customer service, I was informed that I just make a bitcoin deposit in order to withdraw via bitcoin. I then, proceeded to make a $20 or $25 deposit via bitcoin. Once finished, I requested a withdrawal via bitcoin in the amount of $10,000, which was the limit on cash out for the week. After waiting a few days, my withdrawal request was voided by admin without documented justification. When I contacted support on March 21, 2022, they said that I was on a negative list due to my card being compromised at a different casino. They advised me to email support with the following: 1. Copy of your Driver’s license and the card holder’s driver’s license 2. Copy of a Utility Bill in your name, not older than 6 months 3. Front and signed back copy of the card. I immediately sent the email with the requested information. I was also asked to provide an explanation of what happened with my compromised card. I explained that my card was compromised at a separate casino, but that the issue was cleared up and the compromised card was never used on this site. I was told that my account would be reviewed and I could then proceed with my withdrawal. Upon attempting again, my withdrawal was once again voided. I have contacted this casino on multiple occasions to request payout and customer service does not attempt to help me in any manner. Since I was requested to send in the documents, my account was still active until about a week ago when I contacted lcb.com to express my dissatisfaction with the casino being unwilling to pay out the money that I won. The following day, my account was locked and the casino’s customer service and managers will not provide me with any information or confirm any information regarding my account. Please help.</p>
