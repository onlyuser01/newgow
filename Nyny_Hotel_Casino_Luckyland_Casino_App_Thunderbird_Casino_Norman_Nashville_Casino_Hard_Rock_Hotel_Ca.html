<p>Triton Poker Inks Key Partnership with Kraken</p>
<p>Triton Poker, the poker brand that brings together some of the best players for a good cause, inked a key partnership with Kraken, a crypto exchange platform with a presence in over 200 countries. Under the partnership, Kraken will be the Official Crypto Exchange partner of Triton’s 10-part YouTube poker series. While the first two episodes of the series aired back in September, more have been released this month. Triton revealed that the digital partnership isn’t just a collaboration between two proven market leaders. The company outlined that the new deal “creates tremendous synergies since poker was one of the early use cases for cryptocurrencies.”</p>
<p>It was back in 2019 when Triton organized the largest poker tournament that also featured a charitable cause. The Triton Million: A Helping Hand for Charity was the poker tournament with the largest buy-in ever. The entry of the tournament was a staggering $1.4 million (£1,050,000). The tournament welcomed 54 of the best professional and amateur poker players around the world. Each of the competitors that participated in the Triton Million tournament donated $68,000 (£50,000) for a charitable cause.</p>
<p>Overall, the tournament raised $3.3 million (£2.4 million). The money that was raised was donated to more than 15 charities around the world including the Malaysian Red Crescent, One Drop Foundation, Raising for Effective Giving (REG), and more.</p>
<p>Triton and Kraken Share Dedication to Charitable Ventures</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, by now Kraken has solidified its presence as one of the longest-standing cryptocurrency exchange platforms globally. In fact, the recent partnership with Triton happens while the company celebrates its 10th year on the global crypto market.</p>
<p>“Triton’s dedication to charitable ventures is a vision that firmly aligns with our own,” reads a statement released by Kraken</p>
<p>In a statement, Kraken outlined that it shares a vision for charitable events with Triton. Additionally, the company said that it is thrilled to support the poker brand while at the same time promoting its products to a “demographic primed for cryptocurrency adoption.” In conclusion, Kraken said that some top poker players are outspoken advocates and support the digital money revolution.</p>
