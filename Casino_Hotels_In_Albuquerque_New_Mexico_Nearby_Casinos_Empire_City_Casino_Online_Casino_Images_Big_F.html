<p>Global leader in gaming technology and software solutions International Game Technology (IGT) announced that its Wheel of Fortune slots has minted another millionaire.</p>
<p>Second Foxwoods Millionaire This Year</p>
<p>IGT announced that a casino patron at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, who wished to remain anonymous, won a $1.2 million jackpot while playing Wheel of Fortune Pink Diamond slots on September 16.</p>
<p>The winner became the second player to win over a million from Wheel of Fortune slots at the casino within the space of five months, following the $1.66 million prize won by another player whose identity was not revealed in May while playing IGT’s Wheel of Fortune Gold Spin Triple Red Hot 7s slots game.</p>
<p>Both wins added to IGT’s tally of over 1,100 millionaires IGT’s Wheel of Fortune slots have minted since they were launched in 1996, awarding over $3.4 billion in the process, yet both wins did not come even close to the world record registered at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune World Record</p>
<p>In the early hours of Saturday, June 17, 2000, a 52-year-old Korean soap opera celebrity put only $6 in the slot machine but that was more than enough for her to hear the bell ringing as she hit the massive $9,487,583.74 Wheel of Fortune dollar jackpot.</p>
<p>She and her family have been on a trip to Vegas since Monday – her only second visit to the gambling Mecca – but not the last as she was awarded the first check for $474,379.18 from the win that is paid by IGT in 20 annual installments as per the Wheel of Fortune jackpots terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Last year, IGT’s omnichannel Powerbucks Slots awarded three players with winnings over the million mark: two in March while playing online Wheel of Fortune Hawaiian Getaway and Wheel of Fortune Ruby Riches in Quebec, winning CA$1,194,278 and CA$1,000,000, respectively, and one in May, CA$1,162,364, also in Quebec, while playing online Wheel of Fortune Ruby Riches.</p>
<p>Millionaire Prizes Awarded Last Year</p>
<p>Also in May, 2021, IGT’s Wheel of Fortune slots minted three other millionaires: one who won $1,253,791 playing Wheel of Fortune Pink Diamond at Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, and two while playing Wheel of Fortune Gold Spin Triple Gold: the one at We-Ko-Pa Casino Resort in Fort McDowell, just outside of Scottsdale, Arizona, won $1,332,819, while the player at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, won around a quarter of a million less, $1,108,042.</p>
<p>The record of the largest jackpot ever won from IGT’s Powerbucks omnichannel progressive link for Canada is held by a PlayOLG player who won CA$2,256,578 in May 2020 while playing Powerbucks Wheel of Fortune Exotic Far East slots game.</p>
