<p>FunFair Games has launched with William Hill, presenting its full range of iGaming solutions. The collaboration allows the company to deploy and expand its footprint in the UK market quickly and efficiently. William Hill’s Mr Green players will have the opportunity to pick from a number of FunFair Games’ products, including Astroboomers to the Moon!, The Wheel of Steal and Hugo: Up and Away.</p>
<p>FunFair Games Happy to Innovate iGaming for All</p>
<p>All of the games are part of a new tradition of development in iGaming which seeks to innovate how people enjoy and interact with iGaming in the first place. Astroboomers is a crash-style game where players take a chance on virtual space rockets soaring through the skies and adding multipliers to a potential win.</p>
<p>The caveat is that each rocket may explode if the players do not eject their characters on time. William Hill is one of the first companies in the UK to offer FunFair Games products which the company hopes will also give it a competitive edge. FunFair in the meantime is committed to expanding its reach in regulated markets and collaborating with more brands in the United Kingdom and beyond.</p>
<p>The integration of content for William Hill is carried out through SlotMatrix. FunFair Games commercial director Carlo Cooke welcomed this opportunity and said that launching with Willian Hill is a significant achievement for the company.</p>
<p>More Opportunities Lie Ahead for FunFair Games</p>
<p>It’s a recognition of FunFair Games’ commitment to creating pioneering products in the gambling industry. Cooke added:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to kick off this partnership with William Hill and to introduce our titles to their large customer base. We have ambitious growth plans, and this is a fantastic step forward in that journey. FunFair Games commercial director Carlo Cooke</p>
<p>William Hill global gaming content manager Sarah Patrick was similarly pleased with the development and said that FunFair Games is at the forefront of developing non-traditional iGaming content. The products the company delivers are entertaining and engaging, focused on multiplayer and social, which is precisely what William Hill needs.</p>
<p>“We are always looking to bolster our offering and with FunFair Games’ content, we will be able to introduce our customers to a unique and exciting vertical,” she concluded.</p>
