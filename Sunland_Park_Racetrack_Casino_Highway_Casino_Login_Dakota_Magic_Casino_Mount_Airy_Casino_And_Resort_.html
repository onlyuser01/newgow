<p>Entertainment and gaming leader Mohegan published a new report, highlighting the economic impact of its properties. The company said that its venues generated a total of $5.2 billion in local economic activity within a year.</p>
<p>Mohegan Commissioned an Inaugural Economic Impact Report</p>
<p>Mohegan published the results of its first Economic Impact Report, a study conducted by Oxford Economics. The report in question is based on Mohegan’s 2019 activities, which are the most representative of the company. The operator pointed out that its casino and hospitality facilities generated $5.2 billion in local economic activity.</p>
<p>Mohegan’s properties had a dramatic positive impact on employment, household income, visitor spending and taxes, the company remarked. The research shows that the casino and hospitality specialist created nearly 35,000 new jobs. In addition, the 15.7 million customers who visited Mohegan’s US and Canada-based properties in 2019 helped the company generate over $2.7 billion in revenues. As a result, the company paid $759.3 million in state and local taxes – a number which includes gaming contributions. Lastly, Mohegan’s recorded around $639.2 million in business purchases that supported local businesses and communities.</p>
<p>The casino and hospitality firm noted that this analysis is based on the performance of all Mohegan properties, including Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Mohegan Pennsylvania, ilani in Washington, Resorts Casino Hotel in New Jersey and Niagara Casinos in Ontario.</p>
<p>The Company Wants to Support Its Local Communities</p>
<p>James Gessner Junior, the Mohegan Tribe’s chairman said that Mohegan is committed to supporting the communities in which it operates. This report, Gessner pointed out, makes it clear that Mohegan is able to truly have an impact.</p>
<p>We are guided by our core values and our centuries-old philosophy, ‘Spirit of Aquai’ – living the importance of cultivating productive and long-term relationships. This study demonstrates the important benefits of those relationships. James Gessner, chair, Mohegan Tribe</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, Mohegan’s president and chief executive officer, added that the company is glad to continue benefiting local businesses and communities. He noted that the company is looking forward to expanding in new regions, such as Las Vegas and Korea. Pineault promised that Mohegan will care just as much about the communities of these new locations as it does for its existing communities.</p>
<p>As we continue to expand into new locations, including Las Vegas and Korea, we look forward to continuing to contribute to the prosperity of the communities in which we live and serve. Ray Pineault, CEO, Mohegan</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mohegan struck a new deal with Intelitics, a leading performance marketing and analytics provider. The latter will help the casino giant expand its reach.</p>
