<p>Hub88, a company that specializes in the provision of platform solutions for iGaming operators, has strengthened its content library by teaming up with Peter &amp; Sons, a studio known for innovative games such as Johnan Legendarian, Xibalba, and Valkyries amongst others.</p>
<p>The partnership is designed to help Hub88 deliver a range of new and fresh experiences for its partner operators which will now benefit from Peter &amp; Sons’ existing and future releases, including the recently rolled-out Barbarossa slot game.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; Sons has made a name for itself by building solid games that have standout graphics, gameplay, and mechanics. The alliance benefits both parties significantly as Hub88 will have access to outstanding titles, and then again – Peter &amp; Sons will be able to ensure that their games are visible to a wider audience, and possibly break ground with more operators.</p>
<p>Hub88 Head Ollie Castleman welcomed this new opportunity and said that it was exciting to see a boutique studio such as Peter &amp; Sons become a member of the company’s portfolio of supplier partners.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to now be their distribution partner as we can offer content that is truly different and that stands out, appealing to players around the globe," Castleman noted. For its part, Peter &amp; Sons has not been limited to one aggregator only, with the company also becoming a member of the Silver Bullet by Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Hub88 has also been adding more operators, including 1X2 Network which brought a range of games to the table as well. Peter &amp; Sons Founder &amp; Commercial Director Yann Bautista was also excited about the partnership and its long-term significance for both companies.</p>
<p>Bautista said that finding strong distribution partners is key for the company’s growth and future, and this is precisely why Hubb88 will give a significant boost to the operator.</p>
<p>"Following a streamlined integration process, we are thrilled to now be live with Hub88 and look forward to a successful partnership," Bautista concluded. Hub88 has been expanding its portfolio of suppliers with other companies, too.</p>
<p>Recently, the platform secured content alliances with Urgent Games and ELA Games, building its strength and adding exponentially to the variety of available online casino games that third-party operators can access through one single platform.</p>
