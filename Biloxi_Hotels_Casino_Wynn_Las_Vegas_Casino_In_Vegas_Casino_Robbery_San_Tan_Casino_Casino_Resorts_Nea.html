<p>Hip-hop star and winner of four Grammy awards Drake is making the headlines after an agreement to collaborate with Canadian betting platform Stake.com and effectively double down on his commitment to digital currency.</p>
<p>‘Drake on Stake’</p>
<p>The prominent musician, who has already built a reputation for himself for placing huge bets on all types of sporting events, announced a live event in partnership with betting platform Stake.com.</p>
<p>“It was inevitable. Drake and Stake have come together.” Drake</p>
<p>“I am going to be announcing a date for an upcoming live event where I play to win some real money and give it all to you because what’s better than sharing the love with my people. Stay tuned for details,” said Drake on his Instagram profile, announcing the event that is yet to receive an official date.</p>
<p>Besides the “Drake on Stake” event, the collaboration with Stake.com will encompass a series of exclusive live video streams throughout 2022 in which Drake will be working with the marketing teams to bring an exciting new experience to the platform users and offer them a chance to win alongside him.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, co-founder of Stake.com Ed Craven outlined the active role Drake has been playing in the platform’s global community for the past few months, and the “next step and natural evolution” for both parties was to come together and collaborate on a stream.</p>
<p>“We share the same love for crypto, gambling and community and are like-minded fans of the technology and culture at the forefront of this movement.” Ed Craven, Co-Founder, Stake.com</p>
<p>Making Betting Headlines</p>
<p>Last month Drake again made the headlines in relation to gambling after his bets on Super Bowl LVI reportedly won him nearly a million-and-a-half in Bitcoin equivalent.</p>
<p>The rapper placed bets amounting to $1.25 million worth in Bitcoin on the Rams to win against the Bengals and on Odell Beckham Jr., one bet, to achieve at least 62.5 receiving yards and another, to score a touchdown. Drake won two out of the three wagers and ended up winning.</p>
<p>Drake is also a fan of placing wagers with his pals and in 2018 Quavo from Migos had to part with a sizeable amount following a lost wager on his hometown Georgia Bulldogs in the College Football Playoff National Championship.</p>
<p>On the music scene, Drake’s last year album “Certified Lover Boy” set a new US record after 595,000 downloads and over 600 million plays on streaming websites.</p>
<p>Drake became the latest high-profile figure to collaborate with the Canadian betting platform, following in the footsteps of recently retired professional soccer player Sergio Aguero, who teamed up with Stake.com in a multi-year partnership last month.</p>
