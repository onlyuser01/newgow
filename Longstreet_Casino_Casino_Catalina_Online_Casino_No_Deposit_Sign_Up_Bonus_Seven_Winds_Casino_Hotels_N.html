    <h1>Longstreet Casino Casino Catalina Online Casino No Deposit Sign Up Bonus Seven Winds Casino Hotels N</h1>

<p>Leading B2B cloud-based product and platform services and performance marketing provider Gaming Innovation Group (GIG) has agreed to provide Crab Sports, a Maryland-based sports betting startup, with its solutions.</p>
<p>GIG Will Provide Crab Sports with Sportsbook</p>
<p>As per the agreement, the provider will power Crab Sports’ offerings with its tech platform, sportsbook and content management system. These additions will help Crab Sports continue to grow its market share and establish itself as one of the state’s leading operators.</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Brown, commented on the deal and said that he is very optimistic about the future of his company’s partnership with Crab Sports. He praised the latter company for being a promising Maryland-based localized operator. Brown also noted that his company views Maryland and the wider US market as a strong opportunity to grow GIG’s footprint.</p>
<p>Brown pointed to GIG’s expertise in personalization and creating unique customer experiences and said that this can help GIG team up with other localized brands.</p>
<p>We believe we can partner with brands, such as Crab Sports, and truly provide them with differentiation on the market and help them compete against the nationwide Tier 1 players. We look forward to working with the excellent team at Crab Sports to help build a brand and an experience that will stand out in Maryland. Richard Brown, CEO, GIG</p>
<p>GIG Returns to the US Market</p>
<p>The current deal with Crab Sports is notably GIG’s first US-facing agreement since the acquisition of Sportnco in April this year. Back then, the B2B provider agreed to purchase its fellow solutions provider in a €51.37 million deal. Thanks to this, GIG greatly boosted its sports betting offerings, helping its client operators offer superior products to their users.</p>
<p>Additionally, the agreement with Crab Sports will help GIG consolidate power in Maryland, a key state that launched legalized sports betting less than a year ago. Analysts predict that the Old Line State will earn $217 million in its first year of sports wagering.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Gaming Innovation Group signed a three-year partnership deal with sports betting and gaming company Caravel Entertainment through its Sportnco subsidiary. The agreement saw Caravel Entertainment power GIG with its proprietary Moosh brand, helping it attract lightning-fast revenue growth. This Portugal-facing agreement further expanded GIG’s footprint in Europe and armed GIG with another powerful solution.</p>
