<p>The world's leading sports technology company, Sportradar, expanded further its North American and global presence after securing a new license. The company said Tuesday that its US-facing subsidiary, Sportradar Solutions LLC, secured a temporary license from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC), the gambling regulator in the state.</p>
<p>Massachusetts legalized the activity last year. Now, on January 31, 2023, the state officially started accepting legal in-person sports wagers. The launch of the retail sports betting market coincided with the Temporary Sports Wagering Vendor license secured by Sportradar this week.</p>
<p>The license marks a milestone moment for the company as it continues its US-facing expansion. At the same time, Sportradar is benefitting from expanding its presence in North America as well. Adding the recent license, now, the company has 44 licenses in North America, including in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The company currently provides its leading services to "a wide range of clients operating within these jurisdictions, advancing transparency and integrity and delivering accurate sports data to sports betting and gaming agencies," a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The recently secured vendor license in Massachusetts comes during a busy period for the company. Only recently, Sportradar signed an agreement with the Biathlon Integrity Unit (BIU). The BIU is an independent unit that monitors the integrity on behalf of the International Biathlon Union (IBU), the governing body of biathlon around the world.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the company agreed to monitor all competitions under the IBU, including the IBU World Cups and IBU World Championship. Per the terms of the new collaboration, Sportradar will utilize its Universal Fraud Detection System (UDFS). Thanks to the deal, Sportradar will flag suspicious matches which can then be investigated further by the BIU.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in January, the company extended its collaboration with Betway, a Super Group-owned brand. This deal saw Sportradar deploy additional services for the popular operator, expanding further their successful business-to-business collaboration.</p>
<p>More recently, Sportradar announced the launch of a suite of artificial intelligence-led solutions that help power its in-house sportsbook operators called Insight Tech Services. The unique solutions, according to the company, helps sportsbook operators "to optimize the performance of their trading, risk management and marketing functions."</p>
<p>In a statement released on February 2, 2023, Sportradar's Managing Director Managed Betting Services, Paolo Personeni, shared his excitement saying: "By combining Sportradar's market leading artificial intelligence and impressive depth of betting industry data, Insight Tech Services provides operators with the tools they need to manage an efficient sportsbook in-house and directly engage with bettors, delivering a service that's tailored to the interests and preferences of individual customers."</p>
