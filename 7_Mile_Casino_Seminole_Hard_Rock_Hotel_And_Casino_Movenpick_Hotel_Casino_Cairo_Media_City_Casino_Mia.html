    <h1>7 Mile Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Movenpick Hotel Casino Cairo Media City Casino Mia</h1>

<p>Desert Diamond Mobile LLC has selected Strive Gaming to provide the company with managed services and player platform solutions. With this development, Strive Gaming is set to make its Arizona debut as Desert Diamond Mobile will launch a branded mobile and online sportsbook in the state.</p>
<p>Arizona Bettors Will Be Able to Enjoy A Unique Experience</p>
<p>Strive Gaming is a first-player platform company that is designed to meet multi-state requirements and for operators that are specifically looking to expand in North America, with the United States and Canada as their core focus.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, Desert Diamond Mobile is launching an online and mobile sportsbook under its brand name for the first time in Arizona. The Tohono O’odham Nation owns Desert Diamond Mobile LLC and this company is one of the state’s largest casino operators. All four Desert Diamond Mobile casinos in Arizona are operated by the Tohono O’odham Gaming Enterprise.</p>
<p>Strive Gaming and Desert Diamond Mobile signed a multi-year agreement with one goal in mind – to use the solutions by Strive Gaming to provide existing and new bettors on Desert Diamond Mobile’s platform with a world-class experience, one that they receive at all of the brand’s casinos, and via the available online channels.</p>
<p>The CEO of Strive Gaming, Max Meltzer, stated that he recognized the massive quality and importance of Desert Diamond’s brand after spending some time on its properties. Meltzer added that the company will gain massive power by integrating its customers online, which will be underpinned by Strive’s leading technology.</p>
<p>He ended by saying that the present opportunity is a fascinating and ambitious project and that Strive Gaming is looking forward to having a long and fruitful relationship with Desert Diamond Mobile.</p>
<p>Strive’s Managed Service Solutions Will Operate Non-Stop</p>
<p>The new platform is set to be market competitors with Fubo Sportsbook. The managed service solutions by Strive Gaming is one of the best features of the platform as they run 24/7/365. Players will be provided with dedicated customer support by trained agents that are based in Europe and across North America.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Kambi tech stack which powers the sportsbook will benefit Desert Diamond Mobile as it will unlock numerous upsides. Desert Diamond Mobile will launch in Arizona ahead of the NFL Playoffs via its official website – playdesertdiamond.com.</p>
<p>As for Strive Gaming, the reason why its platform is so advanced is that it has been built on the post-PASPA market and it meets individual operator needs, based on the jurisdiction in which where they operate. Logically, each US state regulates online betting and casino gaming differently, and Strive Gaming is able to meet all of the differing requirements.</p>
<p>Strive has the Infinity Engine, which is a flexible rules engine that helps operators connect better with their customers and as a result, increases the overall performance while remaining compliance-ready.</p>
