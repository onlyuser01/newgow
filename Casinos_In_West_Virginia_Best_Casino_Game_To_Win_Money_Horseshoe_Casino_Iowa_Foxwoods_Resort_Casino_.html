    <h1>Casinos In West Virginia Best Casino Game To Win Money Horseshoe Casino Iowa Foxwoods Resort Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Lucky Tiger Casino representative,</p>
<p>I will give you an example:</p>
<p>If you decide to drive to a new country for a vacation and you get lost in the night in the new city and use the road that looks normal but somewhere behind the tree is a one-way sign. After you pass the short route, the police stop you and ask you to pay a ridiculously high fine for what you did, which will cost you almost all the money that you have. Now honestly, answer me, would you return to that country, even when you made a mistake? I bet that you turn right away and sad return and tell everybody about your negative experience.</p>
<p>And it wouldn't be nice if the policemen, after stopping you, explained to you that this is a one-way street, but they understand that you have overlooked the traffic sign because you are not a local and first time there. And then they ask nicely where you are going and if you need help with navigation.</p>
<p>Because what I see in this case is a regular player. (definitely not a bonus hunter (from a playstyle)). This player made over 6000 bets; in one bet, she accidentally bet $2.5 more than she should have. She didn't even win this bet. (if she would win from this bet a considerable amount, of course, you should void the winnings) but not when it is obvious that this single bet was an accident. She didn't get any benefit from it. So arguing that the max bet rule was breached is an excuse not to pay herâ€”nothing else.</p>
<p>We have many casinos on our website that would pay this player without hesitation, and if you do not believe me, I can post many examples of such behaviour here.</p>
<p>It is your decision on which side you want to be on. To be the strict casino trying to find anything to avoid paying or a fair casino that accepts that players may win and are happy when players are happy. Because more happy players are the goal for the casino and not to save every cent possible.</p>
<p>So please, consult this case with your management and let me know which type of casino you want to be.</p>
<p>We are following our fair gambling codex when we make decisions in complaints.</p>
