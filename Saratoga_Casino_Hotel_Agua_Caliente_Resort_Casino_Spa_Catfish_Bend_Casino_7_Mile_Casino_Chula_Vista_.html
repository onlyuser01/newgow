<p>The Top Employers Institute recognized SKS365’s dedication to the well-being of its employees, including it in its ever-growing list of leading people-oriented companies. The operator received praise for its people-related practices and policies, successfully meeting the Institute’s updated list of requirements. SKS365 accepted the distinction with gratitude, pledging to maintain its focus on employees’ needs.</p>
<p>Certified Companies Receive Many Perks</p>
<p>The Top Employers Institute is a leading global authority recognizing excellence in people practices. In 2005, the organization introduced its Certification Seal and started the yearly process of distinguishing the best employers through ever-improving research methodology. Top Employers rapidly expanded its reach, eventually opening eleven offices worldwide to aid in the implementation of better people strategies and enrich the world of work.</p>
<p>So far, the organization has certified 2052 Top Employers in 121 regions across five continents. Companies can apply via The Top Employers Institute’s official website and receive several advantages like benchmarks, HR insights, and advice on best practices. Certified organizations also receive an official seal of recognition and extra tools to leverage their status and promote their brand.</p>
<p>The Operator Regularly Attracts New Talent</p>
<p>SKS365 joins 141 other distinguished Italian businesses as a Top Employer. The Institute lauded the newly certified company’s exceptional performance and its care for the development and needs of employees. SKS365 CPO Brian Dean expressed his delight to be recognized as a Top Employer in Italy and reiterated the company’s ongoing dedication to employee well-being.</p>
<p>This accreditation represents an important recognition of our ongoing commitment to developing a pioneering workplace culture that puts our people’s needs first. Brian Dean, CPO of SKS365</p>
<p>Dean added that the last five years had been transformative as the operator implemented its People &amp; Culture framework. The CPO noted that the Institute’s distinction would be instrumental in maintaining SKS365’s ongoing momentum, allowing the company to attract top talents. The company regularly announces new high-profile hires on its official LinkedIn profile, indicating a healthy and dynamic working environment.</p>
<p>SKS365’s People-Focused Efforts Are Paying Off</p>
<p>SKS365 continues to be one of Italy’s leading gaming and sports betting operators via its Planetwin365 brand, servicing 600,000 registered online customers and maintaining nearly 1,000 retail betting shops. The company claims to be one of Europe’s fast-growing and award-winning Sportsbook &amp; Gaming organizations, sporting a team of over 500 employees across four locations.</p>
<p>The operator retains its users with a diverse and engaging set of content thanks to partnerships with leading developers. In December, SKS365 joined forces with supplier Play’n GO, acquiring 100 new games, with more coming later. The combination of employee satisfaction and a customer-focused approach distinguishes it from the competition and ensures continued avenues for growth.</p>
