<p>Norsk Tipping deepens ties with Playtech in a renewed content partnership for online gaming products and video lottery terminals.</p>
<p>Norsk Tipping and Playtech Renew Push in iGaming and Brick-and-Mortar Gaming</p>
<p>Playtech has signed a brand-new partnership with online Norway’s state gaming operator Norsk Tipping, delivering a range of high-quality iGaming products developed by partner studios such as Quickspin, Ash, Origins, Rarestone and Ash. The partnership also features video lottery terminals (VLT) for the brick-and-mortar venues operated by Norsk.</p>
<p>Thanks to this opportunity, Playtech will deploy its products across multiple verticals, reinforcing Norsk Tipping’s own portfolio and adding innovative solutions that benefit and engage consumers. In the spirit of cooperation and delivering exclusive content, Norsk and Playtech plan to develop a bespoke content that is customized to meet the specific needs of Norwegian players, the press released specified.</p>
<p>The latest move is a continuation of an already successful partnership between the companies which have been working together on online casino products since 2016, and first inked a VLT deal back in 2003.</p>
<p>Executives Happy with Playtech’s Involvement</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership and its meaning for the future, Norsk Tipping Head of Gaming Operations Hans Erland Ringsvold said that Playtech has already proven its expertise in the brick-and-mortar and iGaming segments, making it a valuable partner to Norsk Tipping and supporting the operator’s expansion strategy and better market positioning.</p>
<p>Similarly, Playtech CEO Shimon Akad added that the company was excited to help Norsk Tipping adjust its targets for the coming year and develop market-leading and responsible online and retail gaming products to the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the renewed partnerships, Playtech can continue to strengthen its position in both verticals, Akad added. Meanwhile, Playtech has had a remarkably strong year, securing multiple partnerships, ranging from compliance deals to new content alliances, and distribution opportunities.</p>
<p>A Year in Partnerships</p>
<p>The company entered a partnership with SKS365 and its proprietor Planetwin365 brand to deliver its gaming products to the operator’s consumer base. Before that, Playtech launched its product portfolio at Casumo Casino.</p>
<p>Playtech also teamed up with Swiss Casinos Group granting access to the operator to its iPoker Network. In a bid to improve sustainability and consumer protection, Playtech sought closer ties with TruNarrative’s Affordability Tool, and the company further dipped its toes in esports content opportunities with Golden Matrix.</p>
