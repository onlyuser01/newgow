<p>MGM Resorts International has been added on the list of 750 World’s Best Employers for 2020 compiled by Forbes with the help of Statista.</p>
<p>Forbes Distinguishes MGM Resorts International as Employer</p>
<p>Forbes has distinguished MGM Resorts International in its list of 750 World’s Best Employers for 2020. The casino giant secured 107th place. MGM Resorts is the only Las Vegas Strip to have made the cut.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has been buoyant about its prospects in the industry. Recently, MGM rose a new $750 million debt, signaling investor confidence. That and the upper management’s own drive towards securing a better operational future.</p>
<p>Previously, MGM Resorts ranked 125th in a separate classification study, featuring 500 organizations across the United States. Forbes teamed up with Statista to carry out a complete review of the businesses on the list.</p>
<p>Estimated 160,000 full-time and part-time workers in 58 countries have participated in the survey. Forbes wanted to reach objective conclusions and reflect on both the domestic market as well as brands’overseas operations. The company shortlisted 750 organizations headquartered in 45 countries, giving the survey a rather broad scope.</p>
<p>Other organizations based in the United States to make the list under the ‘Travel &amp; Leisure’ section include:</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean Cruises (134 th )</p>
<p>(134 ) Hyatt Hotels (170 th )</p>
<p>(170 ) Hotels Group (219th)</p>
<p>Marriot International was 28th on the list. Commenting on the listing, MGM Resorts chief people, inclusion, and sustainability officer Jyoti Chopra said that the company was honored to receive the distinction by Forbes. He attested to the commitment and broad skill sets that MGM Resorts employees possessed and said that MGM Resorts employees cared about their mutual welfare as well as the company’s growth.</p>
<p>From Diversity to Sustainability</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has reaped more prizes recently. The Solar Energy Industries Association recognized the company’s efforts in sustainability with MGM committing to generate 90% of its daily energy needs across 13 properties in Las Vegas starting in mid-2021 when a 100-MW solar array will arrive.</p>
<p>According to the list, US companies remain some of the best employers in the world with 247 entities named by Forbes, followed by 224 in Europe and 208 in 208. IBM ranked second in the global survey and South Korea’s Samsung placed first.</p>
<p>Despite its can-do attitude, MGM Resorts had to lay off 18,000 employees as a direct result of the pandemic. Conversely, the company has been bringing back some members of the staff, circumstances permitting.</p>
