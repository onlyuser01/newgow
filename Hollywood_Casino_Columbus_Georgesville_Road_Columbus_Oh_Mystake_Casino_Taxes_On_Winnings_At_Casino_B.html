    <h1>Hollywood Casino Columbus Georgesville Road Columbus Oh Mystake Casino Taxes On Winnings At Casino B</h1>

<p>Following a very strong second quarter, gaming content and technology B2B provider Inspire Entertainment has seen a year-on-year decline in its third-quarter financial results.</p>
<p>Declining Revenues for Inspired in Q3</p>
<p>Game technology firm Inspired Entertainment saw decreasing total revenue and revenues from its various divisions in the third quarter of 2022 with virtual sports revenue being the only sector achieving a year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA also experienced a decline compared to the same period in 2021. The negative results are mostly attributed to the challenging macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p>Despite the declining revenue and overall results, Inspired Executive Chairman Lorne Weil remained positive:</p>
<p>This quarter’s underlying operating performance was strong, with third quarter Adjusted EBITDA exceeding last year’s record performance on a functional currency basis. This reflects a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, with the resiliency of our diversified business model as well as what we perceive to be the continued strength in consumer spending across our segments – notwithstanding perceived ongoing macro trends. Executive Chairman Lorne Weil</p>
<p>Weil also highlighted the major increase in the virtual sports revenue segment, which has shown the strongest yearly growth.</p>
<p>In addition, Weil noted that just after the third quarter ended Inspired signed a major agreement with Betfred, which involves Inspired selling 5,000 gaming terminals to Betfred and providing the necessary services for operating the machines.</p>
<p>Another major highlight in the results announcement was the company’s success at the recent Global Gaming Expo held in Las Vegas and the World Lottery Summit in Vancouver, proving the popularity Inspired’s gaming products are gaining in the USA and Canada.</p>
<p>Inspired Q3 Results in Numbers</p>
<p>Inspired’s total revenue reported in the third quarter of 2022 was $74.9 million, which marked a 3% decline compared to the $77.6 million reported in the same quarter in 2021.</p>
<p>However, when adjusted according to functional currency these results reflect a 13% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Gaming revenue was also on its way down experiencing a 12% yearly decrease to $24.1 million in the third quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>In Q32022, leisure revenue was down by 9% to $30.5 million when compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Inspired reported a considerable increase in virtual sports revenue of a whopping 39% to $14.6 million for the quarter ending on September 30, 2022. Based on functional currency, this meant a 63% increase in comparison to Q32021.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA in Q32022 was $27.8 million marking a decline of 8% in comparison to Q32021.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the online segment of the company’s business, including virtual sports and the interactive sector, accounted for 50% of the adjusted EBITDA. This meant that it was 14% higher than the 36% contribution the segment made in Q32021.</p>
