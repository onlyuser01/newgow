    <h1>Eagle Casino Gold Nugget Casino Double Down Casino Promo Codes Forum Westgate Resort Casino Black Be</h1>

<p>The largest online casino database which also represents a reputable authority in the iGaming world was distinguished with the Safer Gambling Initiative of the Year Award as a result of its impactful work in improving responsible gaming standards.</p>
<p>The important reward is only given to affiliate services that have proven a steady and unaltered track record in committing to boosting player protection standards. The distinction is also given to affiliate services working on helping the industry to better comprehend gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>Casino Guru’s Gamtegrity Project Showed Excellent Results</p>
<p>All of Casino Guru’s sustained efforts to see the company’s vision of a safer and more transparent industry come to life were best expressed through their Gamtegrity project.</p>
<p>The latter is described as the “unifying home of all responsible gambling and consumer protection projects and initiatives” that were launched by Casino Guru under their brand name and banner.</p>
<p>Managed by Casino Guru’s sustainable safer gambling lead Šimon Vincze, the project effectively brings together some of the company’s most important initiatives and projects directed toward improving the industry standards in relation to problem gambling, gambling harm risks, and player behavior.</p>
<p>The same project also incorporates Casino Guru’s Global Self-Exclusion System. The latter represents a cross-border initiative meant to generate a comprehensive international mechanism that would allow players to self-exclude from regulated gambling markets and take their time to focus on their recovery.</p>
<p>The detailed review that Casino Guru was subject to also included a close inspection of the way the company provided education and protection to players beyond the standard statutory regulations. Casino Guru’s active operations which helped them introduce players to safer gambling experiences in several markets were also assessed, eventually leading to the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The Award, an Important Milestone for Casino Guru</p>
<p>Vincze called the IGB Affiliate Award a well-deserved achievement that represented “a reflection of work throughout the departments” including most of the projects he had personally worked on. He added that the award was a new and important milestone for the company in its ongoing endeavor to offer better guidance on the protection of consumers.</p>
<p>The company also runs the Casino Guru Academy aimed to educate industry professionals regarding the most suitable practices in relation to customer support services, casino promotions, safer gambling practices, and a series of other similarly important topics.</p>
<p>Casino Guru is also responsible for creating tools meant to support vulnerable players in finding better ways to address their issues and come across the help they need. Last October, the company announced it would organize the Casino Guru Awards, in an attempt to award the most responsible casinos with awards and distinctions in a number of categories.</p>
