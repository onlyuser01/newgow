<p>Xpoint has announced that a federal court has granted a motion to dismiss a complaint by a rival company, GeoComply, over alleged patent infringement. Both Xpoint and GeoComply are market-leading geolocation specialists that provide support for the sports betting and gaming industries and ensure compliance on a state-by-state basis.</p>
<p>Federal Circuit Judge William Bryson chose to side with Xpoint in the case, explaining that GeoComply’s geolocation patent was invalid. Essentially, GeoComply had attempted to claim rights over a technology that Judge J. Bryson saw as "unpatentable." Xpoint insisted in the press that this was a "complete win" for the company in the matter.</p>
<p>The company maintained that geolocation specialists should remain as free as possible and open to competition. Commenting on this opportunity Xpoint CEO Marvin Sanderson said that the company was very much happy with the ruling and the legal arguments presented.</p>
<p>Sanderson explained that GeoComply’s claims were without merit and false, and Xpoint was confident from the start that it would prevail. He accused GeoComply of attempting to maintain its "monopoly." Christian Goode, a gaming industry expert, also weighed in on the case and said that the victory was an important one for the entire gaming industry as it embolden disruptive startups to pursue innovation.</p>
<p>Geolocation is a business-critical service, Goode reminded, and gaming companies were somewhat limited in their choice of a partner until now. Meanwhile, GeoComply and Xpoint have been locked in a fierce fight for market share. While GeoComply has a significant share of the market, owing to its first-move advantage and quality product, Xpoint is playing catchup quickly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GeoComply has been sharing useful industry data. During the latest Super Bowl game last Sunday, the company confirmed that it had been able to block 140,000 fraud attempts against consumers, protecting them from a range of cyber threats. The rivalry between GeoComply and Xpoint is set to benefit consumers and businesses that are looking to benefit from the best fraud-prevent and geolocation software solutions in the gaming industry.</p>
