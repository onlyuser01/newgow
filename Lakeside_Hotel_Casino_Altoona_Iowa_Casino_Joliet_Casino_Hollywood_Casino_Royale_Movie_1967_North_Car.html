<p>Falzon is no stranger to the gambling industry, having previously served a variety of gaming companies</p>
<p>AvatarUX, a developer of “dazzling slots that pop,” has reinforced its leadership team with a new chief executive officer. The one up to the task is the experienced Lara Falzon who will help the studio continue its impressive strides.</p>
<p>Falzon is no stranger to the gambling industry, having previously served a variety of gaming companies. She joins AvatarUX from Bragg Gaming where she served for two years, first as a non-executive director and then as president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Before her tenure at Bragg, Falzon had stints with other notable companies, such as NetEnt and Red Tiger. Her prior experiences saw her work with other industry entities, such as Evoke Gaming and King.</p>
<p>Falzon joins the company as AvatarUX’s outgoing CEO, Nicola Longmuir, prepares depart because of family-related reasons. For reference, Longmuir has been heading the company since early 2022.</p>
<p>An Exciting Time for AvatarUX</p>
<p>AvatarUX’s new chief executive commented on her new appointment, expressing her excitement about this new opportunity. Falzon said that she feels honored to serve AvatarUX as CEO at what she called an “extremely exciting time for the company.”</p>
<p>Falzon praised the company’s rapid expansion, saying that she hopes to double down on its growth.</p>
<p>AvatarUX has grown incredibly fast and has made an impression with operators and players alike for their innovation and the fantastic entertainment their games offer. I look forward to being a part of the future success story that will take the company to new heights. Lara Falzon, CEO, AvatarUX</p>
<p>AvatarUX’s chair, Tomas Bäckman, welcomed Falzon to the AvatarUX family. He said that the company and its team feel safe in Falzon’s hands and are assured that the new CEO will drive future growth.</p>
<p>Bäckman lauded Falzon’s experience, echoing her words that it is an exciting time for the company.</p>
<p>Her [Falzon’s] experience and skills are second to none and will be crucial as we continue to expand and bring new and unique products to market. It is a really exciting time for the business. Tomas Bäckman, chair, AvatarUX</p>
<p>Bäckman also used the opportunity to thank Longmuir for her incredible contributions to the company over the past two years. He thanked her for everything she had done and wished her all the best for the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, AvatarUX continues to grow geographically and enhance its industry-leading portfolio with new hits. The company just received two nominations at the SlotsWise Awards 2023/2024 and is looking forward to performing even better in 2024.</p>
<p>In September, AvatarUX injected its portfolio into BetConstruct’s aggregation solution.</p>
