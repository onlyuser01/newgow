    <h1>Fire Keepers Casino Casino Royal Caribbean Casinos Pennsylvania How Old To Go To Casino Hotels Near</h1>

<p>I fairly won 3530 dollars on a game called tree of fortune after depositing $300 dollars when I put in my withdrawal it was taking ages so I kept asking and the online customer service representative said I had to be patient and that my withdrawal was being processed, 3 hours later after I repeatedly asked if everything was ok and was repeatedly told to be patient I was then told I had violated a casino rule and I would be forfeiting all of my winnings and the 300 I deposited. At first they couldnt tell me which rule and after many tireless conversations and tears and frustration they are now telling me I used a bug or something like that. I didnt use a bug or any other type of crustacean or mammal to get my winnings I simply hit the spin button everytime it was my turn to spin and I got lucky and my housemate had a theory which seemed to help. I had previously lost 800 or more only the hour before I'd won the money.. I reckon I could bet on the fact they wouldnt pay that though if I thought that they had diddled me somehow. I have screenshots of my winnings and some of the bets I made and screen shots of me trying to resolve this with them . Please help it's the first time Ive ever won and it's exciting experience has made it so bitter!</p>
<p>Frustrated and sad</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Frankie</p>
