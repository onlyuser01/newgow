<p>Here is my dialogue with their support, they just insolently scoff and laugh at me repeating the same information without even trying to help --- HISTORYSupport 03/21/2021 18:13</p>
<p>There is no problem, all current available withdrawal methods are in the "Finance" section, it is impossible to withdraw in any other way at the moment, sorry.</p>

<p>I personally checked by looking at the information about the available conclusions, why should I write in support if this information is in the public domain, is on your website, why are you fooling my head, let's solve the current problem that arose through your fault, since you did not indicate the correct one information and deliberately misled me !!!</p>

<p>Why then did you not remove the information about what can be withdrawn to qiwi, why did you deceive me, then let me withdraw it in cryptocurrency</p>

<p>Here you have it written what can be displayed on kiwi, where is the kiwi? Why did you deceive me saying that you have a conclusion on kiwi? How can I get the money now?</p>

<p>You do not have qiwi, and there is no withdrawal in cryptocurrency, have you not read my message or are you just kidding me?</p>
<p>Support 03/21/2021 17:34</p>
<p>Withdraw to any account from which you previously replenished, which is available during withdrawal</p>

<p>I have always used qiwi, made a deposit using cryptocurrency, usually in normal licensed casinos, what did you deposit in that you can withdraw, in your case there is a deposit using cryptocurrency, but there is no withdrawal in cryptocurrency, how so? I don't have a bank card, piastrix doesn't suit me either, how are we going to solve the problem?</p>
