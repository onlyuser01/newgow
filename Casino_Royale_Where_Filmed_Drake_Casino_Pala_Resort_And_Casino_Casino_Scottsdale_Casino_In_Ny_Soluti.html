<p>The company that assists gaming, crypto and blockchain companies with compliance and regulatory licensing, SolutionsHub, announced a senior-level appointment. On Monday, SolutionsHub revealed it hired the services of industry expert and ex-Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC) Inspector, Nick Bowden.</p>
<p>Joining SolutionsHub, Bowden will serve as the company's Head of Regulatory Affairs. In his new position, he will be in charge of strategic regulatory processes and collaborate with its C-suite members.</p>
<p>Lee Hills, SolutionsHub's Chief Executive Officer, welcomed Bowden to the company's team of experts, a statement reveals. "We are always looking for talented, results-driven people and Nick fits the profile perfectly," he said. Last but not least, Hills pointed out: "As a former Inspector, Nick brings a wealth of knowledge and is a fabulous resource for our clients, so we are thrilled to have him onboard."</p>
<p>Throughout his professional career, Bowden has accumulated experience while holding compliance and business management roles. Back in September 2020, he joined the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission. While with the Commission, Bowden held the role of an Inspector. During his tenure, he gained invaluable experience in policy application and gambling regulation.</p>
<p>Bowden holds a BSc degree in Health and Sports Studies. Additionally, he completed an International Compliance Association Specialist Certificate specializing in Money Laundering Risk in Betting and Gaming. Currently, Bowden is progressing toward an International Diploma in AML.</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Bowden said that he liked working for GSC and collaborating with its dedicated team of experts. This, according to him, made the decision to leave GSC more difficult. However, he acknowledged that SolutionsHub is a company that has built a strong reputation within the growing gambling industry and especially within the esports and blockchain verticals.</p>
<p>Finally, Bowden said: "I'm excited to get started in my new role as Head of Regulatory Affairs and to be working with such an innovative team, driving new markets and promoting the Isle of Man as the premier jurisdiction for gaming companies."</p>
<p>Founded back in 2016, SolutionsHub leverages unique expertise and helps with the registration and maintenance of gaming, crypto and blockchain businesses to comply with regulations. The company helps its partners by resolving complex operational and regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Overall, SolutionsHub has secured more than 35 awards for its work within the blockchain and iGaming industry. The company has won Cryptocurrency Services Supplier in 2019 and 2022, as well as two EGR B2B Awards.</p>
