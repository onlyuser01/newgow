    <h1>Chumbo Casino Grand Sierra Resort And Casino Reno Nv Davinci S Gold Casino Palace Casino Resort Casi</h1>

<p>Hello chantels0210, Viliam,</p>
<p>Thank you for your replies.</p>
<p>Viliam, I have forwarded the evidence now to your email.</p>
<p>Chantels0210, I have reviewed your account again and we can not see you would have ever notified us the card **5701 is connected to a joint account. In fact, on the 3rd of April, 2022, you were in contact with our Customer Support in Live Chat and mentioned this card being a prepaid card. Should you have the transcript saved on your email, you will find this chat with incident number #2644649.</p>
<p>We can also see in our system, that the cardholder name inputted for this card upon depositing was not your name, but another name, S<strong><em>* B</em></strong>****. Based on this, we have reasonable doubts to suspect this is a 3rd party payment method, even though we haven’t been able to fully confirm it, as you did not provide us with a Proof of Ownership for this card. The pictures of the card you sent us do not show a name.</p>
<p>In addition to making a chargeback, you had also created multiple accounts on one of our brands, Wildz, with different details. These are both breaches of our Terms and Conditions and your accounts with us have been permanently closed as per management decision. This also means the 200 CAD will remain confiscated and shall not be returned to you.</p>
<p>Please see the following clauses of our Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>5.2 - You may only hold one Account with us at any single point in time. We reserve the right to close any multiple Accounts opened in the same name or in any way referable to the same person. At Wheelz’s sole discretion, and in the event that we consider that multiple Accounts have been opened in genuine error, we may agree to credit one Account which you have opened with us with any balance remaining on your additional Account(s). Should we have reasonable grounds to believe that fraud has been committed or attempted, we reserve the right to cancel any related transaction, any Bonus or any other promotion without prejudice to any other action. In these Terms and Conditions, a reference to ‘fraud’ shall be deemed to include ‘Bonus abuse’. Bonus abuse includes, but is not limited to, opening more than one Account in order to claim an additional Bonus or benefit.</p>
<p>6.15 - You acknowledge that we shall have the right to block a Wheelz Account should we receive a chargeback request concerning that Account. When a chargeback request has been received, we will contact you as the registered Account holder, to seek confirmation of your identity. If necessary, we shall also ask you to confirm your preferred method of payment. Reminders may be sent if the requested confirmation is not received. Administrative fees may apply in such cases, and the balance of your Wheelz Account may decrease in the case of unduly incurred chargebacks, reversals, or other charges we may sustain concerning Your Account. You are to note that any remaining funds held in a Wheelz Account which has been blocked due to a chargeback request, shall be treated as though they were funds on an Inactive Account.</p>
<p>I wish you a nice day!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jenny</p>
<p>Casino Representative</p>
<p>Wheelz</p>
