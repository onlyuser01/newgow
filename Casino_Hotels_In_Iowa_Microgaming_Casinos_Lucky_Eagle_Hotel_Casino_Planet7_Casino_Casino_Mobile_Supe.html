<p>A recent report suggests that the leading betting and gaming company plans to enter the insurance and brokerage after securing licenses from Romania's Financial Supervision Authority</p>
<p>Superbet is famous as a global tech-powered entertainment platform that brings exciting casino and betting experiences to millions of customers around the globe. Founded more than a decade ago, in 2008, the company has been continuously growing and expanding its presence in strategic markets across Europe. While Superbet currently holds a leadership position within the regulated betting market in Romania, a new report suggests that the company will continue to expand, entering new verticals.</p>
<p>As reported by Romania Insider, Superbet has secured a license for an insurance and brokerage company. The licenses were awarded by the country’s Financial Supervision Authority (ASF) and effectively enable Superbet to enter the financial industry and an entirely new sector.</p>
<p>Currently, the company’s betting operating arm, Superbet Betting, has a presence in all major Romanian cities, offering supreme betting experiences for customers. Complementing this activity, in light of the ASF’s licenses, Superbet will now have the option to sell insurance. This would be applicable to the retail, as well as the online sector. Moreover, the licenses from the financial regulator enable the company to assist with brokerage. As a result, Superbet employees will be able to qualify as agents or assistants in brokerage.</p>
<p>The Betting and Gaming Company Continues to Expand</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after recently, Superbet was selected as the title sponsor for the first world series of darts in Poland, the 2023 Superbet Poland Darts Masters. A collaboration announced late last month designated the online betting and gaming operator as the title sponsor of the event that is taking place between July 7 and July 8, 2023, at COS Torwar in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>Superbet’s anticipated entry into the financial vertical also comes at a time when the company confirmed that it withdrew its interest in Slovenia’s Sports Lottery. In addition to Superbet, Entain, the globally recognized gaming company, also showed interest in the lottery but has decided not to pursue such opportunities anymore.</p>
<p>Neither of the two companies described reasons why they suddenly decided to back away from the interest in Slovenia’s Sports Lottery. Still, the latest endeavor announced by Superbet reveals that the company remains dedicated to growing and expanding its presence by entering new sectors.</p>
