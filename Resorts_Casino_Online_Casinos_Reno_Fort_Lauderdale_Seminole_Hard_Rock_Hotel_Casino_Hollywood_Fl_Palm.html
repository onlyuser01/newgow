<p>FTN Network truly knows how to best use SSG’s solutions, the latter company’s SVP of B2B partnerships said</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), a leader in tech, content and media that delivers distinctive betting experiences, has unveiled a new partnership with FTN Network. Under the agreement, SSG has re-engineered three platforms for its new partner.</p>
<p>FTN is a company that excels in providing affordable, customizable and reliable data to the betting and daily fantasy industries. The company works with individual customers, betting startups and established companies, providing them with sports data and tools they can trust.</p>
<p>Thanks to its new agreement with SSG, FTN’s platforms, namely FTNFantasy, FTNBets and FTNDaily will now be able to benefit from SSG’s cutting-edge publishing platform. As a result, the three platforms will be able to use SSG’s checkout services and SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>SSG’s affiliate management services are now deployed across the three platforms, allowing FTN to continue supplying its partners with relevant offers.</p>
<p>The improvements to FTN’s platforms will allow platform managers to elevate and personalize the experience for their customers. The additions are in line with FTN’s goal to grow its platforms in an organic fashion, while constantly improving the consumer experience.</p>
<p>FTN Trusts in SSG’s Capabilities</p>
<p>Kevin Adams, FTN Network’s founder and chief executive officer, welcomed SSG to the FTN family. He said that the partnership with SSG will help his company realize its technological vision, solidifying FTN’s position as a leading source for sports bettors and fantasy sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Our vision for our redesign was to provide a cleaner, more modern and premium user experience for our subscribers. Kevin Adams, founder &amp; CEO, FTN Network</p>
<p>Rick Wolf, SSG’s senior vice president of B2B partnerships, also commented on the matter, praising FTN Network for truly understanding how to utilize SSG’s solutions. Wolf added that FTN’s vision for ease of use, findability and deeper features using proprietary data has been seamlessly executed across FTNFantasy, FTNBets and FTNDaily.</p>
<p>Wolf added that the integration did not undermine FTN’s SEO strength.</p>
<p>The upgrades were implemented across the board using our new SaaS capabilities and delivered in collaboration with the great team at FTN Network. The upgrades feature a cleaner and more personalized design allowing for greater findability, which allows FTN Network to stand out amongst the competition with premium services for the upcoming NFL season. Rick Wolf, SVP of B2B partnerships, SSG</p>
<p>SSG’s content is hailed as best-in-class in the industry. Because of that, in March, Sky Betting and Gaming asked the provider to create a special content hub for this year’s Cheltenham Festival.</p>
