<p>Yaroslav Amosov Going for His 28th Career Win</p>
<p>Born and bred in the Irpin suburb of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, Yaroslav Amosov has proved many times he’s a real warrior both inside and outside the cage. Back in February 2022, when Russia attacked Ukraine, the mixed martial artist volunteered to be a part of the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>His hometown was invaded in the early days of the war and his house was shelled by the Russians. After Ukraine liberated Irpin, Amosov went home to retrieve his Bellator Welterweight Championship belt, which stayed hidden in the basement.</p>
<p>Bellator welterweight champion Yaroslav Amosov (26-0) has been defending Ukraine from Russian invaders with weapons in his hands for the second month. The MMA fighter returned to the liberated Irpen, where he took his Bellator championship belt, which he hid in the basement. pic.twitter.com/3DVQ4YTRbm — Zero 🇨🇿 🇸🇰 🇱🇹 🇱🇻 🇵🇱 🇺🇦 🇪🇪 (@SNEl787) April 3, 2022</p>
<p>Russians failed to take the belt away from Amosov, and you can be 100% certain he has no intention of surrendering it to Jason Jackson.</p>
<p>This is going to be the second time he’s defending his title; the first happening against Logan Storley last February in Storley’s home country of Ireland. Amoson won the title in 2021 by beating Douglas Lima, and before that, he had six straight wins in Bellator MMA.</p>
<p>Overall, Amosov is 27-0 in his professional MMA career which kicked off back in 2012. He’s still young and at the age of 30, it might be time for him to take it to the next level (UFC), but that won’t be possible if he suffers a loss to Jackson. Is there a chance of something like that happening at Bellator 301?</p>
<p>Jason Jackson to Show the World He Really is an “Ass-Kicking Machine”</p>
<p>Jason Jackson a.k.a. “The Ass-Kicking Machine” is 16-4 overall, with all of his losses happening against pretty nasty opponents. His first career loss happened in 2012 to Colby Covington who later went to become a UFC superstar.</p>
<p>Jackson’s second loss happened in CGA to Hayder Hassan, a fighter best known for reaching the final of The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) in 2015, in which he lost to Kamaru Usman. His No. 3 loss happened in Dana White’s Contender Series – Kyle Stewart beat him by a TKO after Jackson injured his ankle.</p>
<p>His fourth and (so far) last loss happened on his Bellator MMA debut. Ed Ruth beat him by a split decision. Since then, Jackson is 6-0, with each of his wins happening by a unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Yaroslav Amosov vs. Jason Jackson Bellator 301 Prediction</p>
<p>Our Amosov vs. Jackson prediction is that the Bellator 301 main event is going to be a bloody battle that will probably last for the full five rounds. Both fighters are famous for never backing down, so you can be 100% certain that they’re going to keep going until the end.</p>
<p>But who’s going to win the Bellator 301 headliner? Our pick is Amosov, the reason being that he’s just on a much higher level than any other welterweight in Bellator MMA.</p>
<p>Picks: Yaroslav Amosov to win by decision</p>
