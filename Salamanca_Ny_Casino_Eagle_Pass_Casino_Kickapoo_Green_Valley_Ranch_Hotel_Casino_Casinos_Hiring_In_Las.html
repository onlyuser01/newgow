<p>The fast-growing provider of games for the iGaming industry, BGaming, announced a new deal, boosting its global footprint. The company confirmed Friday it joined forces with Geogrator, a Georgia-compliant aggregator.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, BGaming's portfolio will become available for players within the online gambling market in Georgia. This marked an important collaboration as it expanded the reach of the company's content to new audiences, delivering engaging titles and unique mechanics.</p>
<p>Teaming up with Geogrator, BGaming's popular content will become available for partner operators, bringing a fresh portfolio of titles to the market. Thanks to the new collaboration, Geogrator's offering will be expanded via BGaming portfolio that includes slots, as well as other gambling games.</p>
<p>BGaming's titles stand out with engaging mechanics and mathematics, complemented by quality sound and visual effects. Moreover, the company's titles offer features that take the experience of the players to a new level.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 14, 2023, Nika Mikaberidze, Geogrator's Key Account Manager, said: "We are very excited to announce the partnership between Geogrator and BGaming." She added: "BGaming exceeds expectations every day so we are ready for new challenges and an exciting future with them." Last but not least, Mikaberidze pointed out: "Today BGaming offers a wide variety of interesting and entertaining games which will conquer the Georgian market in no time."</p>
<p>Olga Levshina, BGaming's Head of Sales, was similarly excited about the deal by pointing out: "We're thrilled to announce our new partnership with Geogrator, which marks the expansion of our presence in Georgia." She predicted that the collaboration between the company and Geogrator will bring benefits for the duo while at the same time expanding the reach of BGaming to new customers.</p>
<p>The recent deal comes on the heels of another important announcement by BGaming. Last month, the company announced a strategic hire, by adding Ulf Norder, a gambling industry veteran, to its C-level management team. The industry expert joined the company as its new Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Becoming a part of BGaming's C-suite, Norder was tasked with overseeing the expansion of the company on a global scale. Moreover, as Chief Commercial Officer, he is also in charge of the company's commercial strategies and will seek to ensure its growth within existing and emerging markets around the world.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, BGaming's CEO, Marina Ostrovtsova, welcomed Norder to the company's team. She acknowledged that he brings unique experience in different markets and predicted that he will play a pivotal role in the company's future growth.</p>
