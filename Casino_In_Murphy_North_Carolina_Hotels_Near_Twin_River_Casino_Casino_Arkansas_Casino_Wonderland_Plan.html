    <h1>Casino In Murphy North Carolina Hotels Near Twin River Casino Casino Arkansas Casino Wonderland Plan</h1>

<p>GGPoker is getting more serious about its iGaming operations with the world’s biggest poker room now adding fresh content from Yggdrasil, an established supplier of online casino products and solutions. The partnership now covers GGPoker’s global domain and will see Yggdrasil games featured across all jurisdictions covered by the mandatory licenses.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s Titles Already Launch with GGPoker</p>
<p>The companies have negotiated to launch the full range of Yggdrasil games, including the Game Engagement Mechanics, which are expected to drive interest in GGPoker’s bespoke iGaming offer. This is a continuation of the platform’s efforts to continue expanding its portfolio of online casino titles, which will now receive a significant boost from the new supplier. Commenting on this opportunity, Yggdrasil CCO Andrew Pegler said:</p>
<p>We are extremely excited to launch our games with GGPoker, especially during the WSOP Online 2022 tournament series, an event that sees increased traffic to the site. GGPoker continues to expand its online casino segment and we look forward to being a key part of that growth. Yggdrasil CCO Andrew Pegler</p>
<p>GGPoker has pressed on to make sure that the new games arrive on time for the World Series of Poker Online 2022 tournament series, which is expected to see big traffic headed the website’s way, which could potentially translate into bigger activity at the online casino. Yggdrasil also stands to benefit from this partnership as the company will be able to break ground with new customer bases and add to its growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil is also deploying the BOOST solution, an advanced engagement tool designed to increase engagement with new and existing players and audiences. The integration with GGPoker has already taken place, with both companies happy with the end results and looking forward to strengthening their results.</p>
<p>GGPoker Is Happy with the Games by Yggdrasil</p>
<p>GGPoker head of PR Paul Burke said that Yggdrasil “fits the bill,” and that the two companies’ joint efforts will yield the desired results. More entertaining and engaging games by Yggdrasil will be added to GGPoker’s portfolio, Burke said in due time. Yggdrasil has launched a series of prominent slot games over the past month, including RagingPop, Prized Pets, Monsters vs Gigablox, and others.</p>
