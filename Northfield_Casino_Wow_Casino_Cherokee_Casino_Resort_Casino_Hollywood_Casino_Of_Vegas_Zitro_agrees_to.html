<p>The provider of video bingo games and video slots, catering to the growing gambling sector, Zitro, announced a new collaboration, allowing it to expand the reach of its thrilling games. On Friday, the company confirmed it signed a multi-game deal with Orenes Gran Casino Castellón, a premium casino entertainment location in Spain that is a part of the Orenes Group.</p>
<p>The terms of the new partnership see Zitro expand the reach of its Fantasy Wealth and Mighty Hammer games. The aforementioned titles are already renowned for their quality and the unique experiences they bring. Moreover, the two games are famous in different markets across the globe and will now be available for Orenes Gran Casino Castellón visitors.</p>
<p>Jaime Aníbal-Álvarez, Zitro's Director of Casinos in Spain, revealed that the company is thrilled to forge this new partnership. In a statement, he pointed out: "We would like to thank the entire Orenes Group for their trust in Zitro’s products and for once again choosing our games to enhance the entertainment offerings in their casinos."</p>
<p>Francisco Ortiz, Orenes Gran Casino Castellón's Director, was similarly thrilled about the latest collaboration with Zitro. He explained: "Following the success achieved at Orenes Gran Casino Murcia and Orenes Gran Casino Extremadura, we are delighted to introduce these Zitro multi-games in Castellón, further boosting our entertainment offerings in the casino."</p>
<p>Fantasy Wealth currently uses the premium Altius Glare cabinet. The game is famous for its engaging gameplay, unique theme and thrilling mechanics. Players of Fantasy Wealth can expect unrivaled experiences and innovative features.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mighty Hammer is another one of Zitro's fan-favorite games. It is available on the Allure Glare cabinet and offers different levels of excitement thanks to its bonus link. Moreover, Mighty Hammer offers quality animations, sound effects and an overall engaging and thrilling gameplay.</p>
<p>Last month, Zitro expanded its global footprint after opening the doors of a new technology campus located in India. The new campus is expected to play a key role in the development and growth of the company in the region. At the time of the announcement, Zitro revealed that the new campus will create new product development opportunities and enable the company to leverage local talent.</p>
<p>This summer, Zitro announced it expanded the reach of its popular multi-game, Mighty Hammer. Back in July, the company revealed it agreed to provide its game for Gran Madrid Casino Torrequebrada in Benalmádena, Málag, Spain. This marked an important move for the company in the country, enabling customers to enjoy its thrilling game.</p>
