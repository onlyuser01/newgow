<p>The new deal helps expand significantly Playtech's presence in North America and is expected to deliver engaging experiences for Hard Rock customers</p>
<p>The fast-growing content, services and platform provider for the iGaming industry, Playtech, announced a strategic collaboration with Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming’s interactive gaming and sports betting joint venture, Hard Rock Digital (HRD).</p>
<p>Details of the new strategic deal emerged Tuesday and will see HRD license iGaming content, as well as technology solutions from Playtech. Consequently, this content and solutions are going to power Hard Rock’s hospitality, entertainment and casino vertical, delivering engaging experiences for its customers.</p>
<p>For strategic markets such as Canada and the United States, HRD’s customers will benefit from live dealer table games, RNG, as well as slots. This content is expected to supercharge HRD’s current platform and offering. Additionally, the duo confirmed that it plans to extend their collaboration beyond the markets in Canada and the US.</p>
<p>“This partnership will act as an accelerator to Hard Rock Digital’s planned strategic initiative to expand its online gaming offerings to international markets, becoming the first operator with a global omnichannel offering under a singular, irreplaceable brand.“ Jim Allen, chairman of Hard Rock International and chairman of the Board of HRD</p>
<p>Jim Allen, HRI chairman and HRD chairman of the Board, acknowledged that this partnership represents a strategic move for the company that will boost the expansion of HRD. Moreover, he outlined that the collaboration reaffirms the leadership position of Hard Rock and seeks to deliver unique entertainment and gaming experiences for its clients. “We look forward to providing an authentic, digital experience for Hard Rock’s global fan base within a comprehensive, omnichannel offering,” said Allen in conclusion.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Boosts Playtech’s B2B Strategy</p>
<p>Besides the strategic collaboration, Playtech confirmed that it has invested some $85 million “for a low single-digit % minority equity ownership stake in HRD.” With that investment, HRD will grow further its retail and online betting and iGaming position within markets in the US such as Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio and more states, where the company has already established its presence.</p>
<p>“For Playtech, this partnership significantly advances our position in the North American market and is very much in line with our B2B strategy.“ Mor Weizer, CEO at Playtech</p>
<p>Mor Weizer, Playtech’s CEO, said that the company is excited to team up with HRD. Additionally, he explained that Hard Rock International currently holds a leadership position within the gaming and entertainment vertical. Finally, Weizer acknowledged that the strategic deal will help Playtech continue to grow while at the same time complementing its business-to-business strategy.</p>
