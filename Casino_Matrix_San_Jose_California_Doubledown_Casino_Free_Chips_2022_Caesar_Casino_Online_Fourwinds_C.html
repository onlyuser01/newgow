<p>When the season opens Jan. 22, guests with a racing credential or reservation for that day’s races will be permitted to watch from the grandstand, according to Oaklawn’s website. General admission to the grandstand will not be allowed initially.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working on plans covering numerous scenarios, and we’re happy to announce we will be welcoming back race fans in 2021, albeit on a limited basis,” General Manager Wayne Smith said.</p>
<p>Box seat holders and Oaklawn Jockey Club members will receive correspondence from Oaklawn about their options. Face masks will be required for employees and spectators. Other coronavirus-related safety measures, such as social distancing, will be enforced.</p>
<p>Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort worked with the Arkansas Department of Health is setting guidelines for the 57-day season. This year’s season ends May 1.</p>
<p>During the season, restaurants inside the grandstand will be open, but reservations are required.</p>
<p>The Oaklawn track is in Hot Springs, about an hour southwest of Little Rock, the state capital. Little Rock is in central Arkansas.</p>
<p>The dirt track at Oaklawn opened more than 100 years ago. It is home to the annual Arkansas Derby, considered an important run-up to the Triple Crown races. One of the most acclaimed Arkansas Derby winners, American Pharoah, won the Triple Crown in 2015.</p>
<p>Gangsters at Illegal Casinos</p>
<p>Oaklawn is one of three legal casinos in Arkansas. The others are in Pine Bluff and West Memphis. A fourth casino has been licensed for operation in Russellville, but is tied up in a legal dispute.</p>
<p>For decades, casinos operated illegally but openly in Hot Springs, before authorities shut them down in the 1960s. During this era, Hot Springs was a popular vacation spot for the country’s most notorious gangsters.</p>
<p>Among the outlaws who visited Hot Springs were Al Capone of Chicago, and East Coast gangsters Charles “Lucky” Luciano and Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel.</p>
<p>Luciano was arrested in Hot Springs in the 1930s and taken back to New York City to stand trial on a prostitution-rackets charge that led to a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>Siegel made headlines in the 1940s after opening the Flamingo hotel-casino south of downtown Las Vegas on what now is the Las Vegas Strip. A few months later he was shot to death at his girlfriend’s home in Beverly Hills. A killer has never been identified.</p>
<p>Illegal casinos are a part of Hot Springs’ past. Oaklawn is the only place in the area now with legal casino gambling.</p>
<p>Dog Track Closure</p>
<p>Of the three casinos in Arkansas, Oaklawn is the only one with a horse track. Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis has a greyhound race track. However, the track is expected to close at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>With the closure at Southland, only two states, Iowa and West Virginia, will be left with greyhound tracks.</p>
<p>If the dog track in Iowa also closes next year as expected, West Virginia would be the only state in the nation with legal dog racing.</p>
