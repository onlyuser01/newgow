<p>PointsBet continued to strengthen its Canadian executive team with the appointment of Brett Jackman as the new Vice President of Strategy for PointsBet Canada.</p>
<p>‘Expertise and Vision’</p>
<p>New VP of Strategy for PointsBet Canada Jackman is joining the Australian-based sportsbook operator from Rogers Communications (RCI) and will be reporting directly to PointsBet Canada’s chief executive officer Scott Vanderwel.</p>
<p>“Brett’s expertise and vision will be absolutely crucial in helping shape PointsBet Canada’s priorities as we forge further ahead into the budding sports betting landscape.” Scott Vanderwel, CEO, PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>Jackman brings to PointsBet nearly 15 years of experience at large North American companies, spearheading strategic and transformational initiatives on growth, new market and product launches, M&amp;A, and others, and Vanderwel was “thrilled” to have him on board while the business is shaping to build “upon the strong foundation” and drive growth.</p>
<p>At RCI Jackman served as senior director of Corporate Strategy and helped the company drive its long-term strategy across its core business units by being a top strategic advisor and thought partner to senior leadership.</p>
<p>He played a key role in RCI’s project to provide underserved rural and indigenous households in Ontario and Atlantic Canada with high-speed connectivity, as well as the C$26 billion acquisition deal of Shaw Communications.</p>
<p>“The opening of the regulated iGaming market in Ontario represents one of the most exciting business opportunities within Canada in recent memory. As the industry collectively continues to build, we know this space will soon touch so many Canadians from coast to coast to coast.” Brett Jackman, VP, Strategy, PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>‘Truly Authentic and Differentiated Product Experience’</p>
<p>Jackman, who holds significant experience from the technology, media, and telecommunications sectors acquired during his time as a senior consultant with Accenture Strategy before joining RCI, was eager to play his role and ensure his new employer capitalizes on the sports betting opportunity brought to Canadian markets and satisfy sports fans with “a truly authentic and differentiated product experience.”</p>
<p>Holder of a Master of Business Administration degree from the Ivey Business School and undergraduate degrees in Business and Medical Sciences from the University of Western Ontario, Jackman is also involved with the board of Lakefield College School and is chair of its Finance &amp; Audit Committee.</p>
<p>Jackman joined PointsBet Canada shortly after the company had announced its multi-year deal with sports and real estate company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE) to become one of MLSE’s official sports betting partners and strengthen its position on the recently launched market in Ontario.</p>
