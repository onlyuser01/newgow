    <h1>Cashman Casino Games Vegas Vip Online Casino Washington Pa Casino Casinos In New York City Gila Rive</h1>

<p>Thanks to a new partnership, with the help of Scientific Games, ReelPlay content will be available to players at Golden Nugget Online Casino. ReelPlay’s innovative slot mechanic reaches the US shores after debuting in Europe back in 2019.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Teams up with ReelPlay</p>
<p>The gambling colossus Scientific Games (SG) has partnered up with the famous casino content creator ReelPlay. With this recent move, SG is strengthening its market footprint in New Jersey. Under the agreement, ReelPlay content will be available to players logging at Golden Nugget Online Casino. This will be possible with the help of the OpenGaming system platform by Scientific Games.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget players will have access to a sizeable part of ReelPlay’s portfolio and not least El Dorado Infinity Reels slot. Released back in November 2019, El Dorado Infinity Reels offers ReelPlay’s innovative slot mechanic.</p>
<p>With each spin players have a chance to add an additional real, multiplier or re-spin. The game proved highly popular already in Europe. Under the current deal, New Jersey players will be the first to have the chance to play it outside Europe. Adding to Reelplay’s slot portfolio, back in April, the company released another slot game – Giza Infinity Reels. The company plans to release yet another interesting slot title in June called Odin Infinity Reels.</p>
<p>ReelPlay More Than Welcome to The US Market</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Online Casino senior vice president and general manager Thomas Winter commented on the deal: “Golden Nugget Casino continues to be a leading sponsor of innovative slots content in the US market.” He further emphasized that under the agreement, users will receive the exclusive chance of playing games that are pioneers in the slot industry.</p>
<p>Response came also from Scientific Games’ SVP of casino and platforms Dylan Slaney who said: “We’re excited to bring another round of breakthrough experiences to players in New Jersey.” Slaney also had to add: “This launch builds on our OpenGaming ecosystem which gives developers and innovators the opportunity to offer their content to more players than ever before.”</p>
<p>ReelPlay COO David Johnson also commented on the exciting news by saying: “We are delighted that Golden Nugget has chosen ReelPlay games for their players and become our first partner in the US.” Johnson continued that ReelPlay will continue developing and delivering high quality products for New Jersey’s players.</p>
