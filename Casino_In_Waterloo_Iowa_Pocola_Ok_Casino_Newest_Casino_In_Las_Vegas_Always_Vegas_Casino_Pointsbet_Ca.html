<p>FuboTV Inc. subsidiary Fubo Gaming has struck a partnership with the Cleveland Cavaliers, an NBA franchise. The partnership is a continuation of FuboTV’s efforts to establish itself as a one-stop-shop for sports betting and entertainment options with the collaboration hoping to raise awareness for the brand’s wagering products.</p>
<p>The multi-year partnership will be a first for Fubo Gaming with an NBA franchise. Fubo Gaming’s signage will be visible during broadcasts and will have a presence on team television and radio programming, helping push the brand name with fans.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers will further assist Fubo by leveraging marketing assets and social media channels clout. The platform will be part of the Cavs Pick ‘Em free-to-play game, which allows fans to participate in live betting markets.</p>
<p>Welcomed Move by Fubo and the Cavaliers</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Cleveland Cavaliers SVP for global partnerships Shelly Cayette said that the franchise was excited to be adding Fubo Gaming as a partner, describing it as “a company that shares a mutual passion for innovation and as we like to say, who are “obsessed with finding a better way’ in such a new and rapidly-evolving sports gaming category.”</p>
<p>Cayette added that the Cavaliers were proud to help Fubo Gaming increase its brand presence with the team’s fan bases in Ohio and well beyond. Fubo Gaming’s signage and brand will be visible in the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, which is the home arena for the Cavaliers with the signage visible at the start of the 2021-2022 season.</p>
<p>Sharing in the optimism, Fubo Gaming president Scott Butera said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with the Cavaliers as a first for Fubo. “This partnership is a natural extension of our overall goal to deliver sports fans dynamic and engaging experiences with the teams and sports they love,” Butera added.</p>
<p>This partnership comes in the even broader effort undertaken by Fubo to launching the Fubo Sportsbook in the fourth quarter of 2021. The sportsbook has been gearing up for launch by striking partnerships with Paysafe and the Ak-Chin Indian Community in Arizona.</p>
<p>With regulatory approvals still pending, the company expects to service every aspect of the sports experience, whether it pertains to adding pure coverage or enhance that coverage with real-time data and interactive wagering options. Previously, Fubo Sportsbook established a similar partnership with the New York Jets, an NFL franchise.</p>
