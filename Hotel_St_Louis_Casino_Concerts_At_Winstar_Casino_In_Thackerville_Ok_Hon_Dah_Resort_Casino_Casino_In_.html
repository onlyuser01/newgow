    <h1>Hotel St Louis Casino Concerts At Winstar Casino In Thackerville Ok Hon Dah Resort Casino Casino In</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I created my account at Chips.gg because the casino looked reputable. I've never had any problems either. Payouts were always instant (regardless of the amount) and deposits were credited quickly.</p>
<p>Now I registered there (already 1-2 years ago) when I was still a minor. When I turned 18 on March 2nd this year, I uploaded my documents there and was verified.</p>
<p>When I deposited $10000 in $CAKE cryptocurrency a few days ago and then rolled it up to $12000-$13000, I was only able to withdraw $10000 due to the daily withdrawal limit. I wanted to pay off the rest the next day.</p>
<p>The next morning I went to Chips.gg on my phone and was redirected to the "under maintenance" page.</p>
<p>I switched browsers and was able to open the page (with the browser I was NOT logged into Chips.gg in) with no problems.</p>
<p>When I tried to log in there, the message "Account is banned" came up.</p>
<p>I wrote to the live support, they either don't answer at all at some point and the e-mail support.... Which e-mail support? I don't get any replies there.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: I still have $2000-3000 in my account that I can't withdraw because I can't log in because my account got blocked out of nowhere (even though it was verified)</p>
