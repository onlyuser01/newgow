<p>Atlantic City casinos have been looking for new and innovative ways to attract more gamblers to their venues in a world where there is a lot more regional gambling competition than there was a decade or two ago.</p>
<p>That’s why the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) agreed to let casinos start offering games with skill elements as a part of the “New Jersey First” program that wants to bring innovative games to the state before they appear elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now, one casino is taking that concept to its logical extreme by offering a contest based on nothing but skill.</p>
<p>The Borgata will host a basketball free-throw shooting tournament on March 21, a contest that anyone can enter and that will award prizes to the winners.</p>
<p>The event doesn’t require players to pull any levers, roll any dice or hope for the right cards to come: they only need to line up and shoot better than their opponents in order to advance to the money rounds.</p>
<p>$20 Entries, $10,000 in Prizes</p>
<p>Each participant will put up $20 to buy into the tournament. Players will then shoot in three 90-second rounds in an attempt to qualify for the round of 16, after which the tournament will proceed in a head-to-head elimination bracket. The top four finishers will make the money and split a prize pool of $10,000, with the winner taking $5,000.</p>
<p>“This is a first step, something we’ve never been able to do until now,” said Borgata senior vice president Joe Lupo. “A year from now, you’ll probably see a lot more of these skill-based tournaments or even games on the casino floor.”</p>
<p>Officials Say Contest is First In the Nation</p>
<p>Reading this news, it’s natural to wonder what’s so innovative about this. After all, skill-based competitions are played for money all of the time: people compete in sports for money all of the time, and real-money contests like chess tournaments are regularly held in casino resorts on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>The difference here, however, is that the casino itself is offering the contest as an official casino event, rather than allowing someone else to hold a competition in a hotel or arena. That makes this the first ever such contest offered by a licensed casino in the United States, say New Jersey officials.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the progressive thinking of the [DGE] as well as their encouragement as we begin to introduce social and skill-based gaming options to a new generation of players,” said Borgata president and COO Tom Ballance.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) also had positive things to say about the Borgata’s experiment.</p>
<p>“It’s smart for them to be creative and try to find new ways to provide what consumers want, given the highly competitive nature of the region,” said AGA spokesman Chris Moyer.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the tournament, players simply need to be of gambling age (21 or older) and have a valid Borgata players’ club card. That means that even those with extensive basketball experience, perhaps even professionals, could play in the tournament in an attempt to take down the $5,000 top prize. When asked if LeBron James could enter, Lupo gave a clear response.</p>
<p>“Definitely,” he said. “In fact, I wish he would.”</p>
