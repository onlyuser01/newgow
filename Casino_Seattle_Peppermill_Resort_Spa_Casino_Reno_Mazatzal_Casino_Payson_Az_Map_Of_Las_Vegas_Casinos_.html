    <h1>Casino Seattle Peppermill Resort Spa Casino Reno Mazatzal Casino Payson Az Map Of Las Vegas Casinos</h1>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I signed up at the casino and made a deposit and received a bonus. After playing with it for a while with different bets of the money up to a maximum of €5 per game, I won around €3,000 in one game. But first I had to fulfill the bonus conditions. So I kept playing and when I had successfully completed the bonus conditions, there were still around €2600 left. I kept playing until I was up to €2200. From this I wanted to have 1200.-€ paid out. After the application I received an email with the information that I violated the terms and conditions. When receiving a bonus, you can only bet a maximum of €4 per game. But in the games it is not a problem to raise the stakes. I am aware that I should have read the terms and conditions, but first of all they are completely in English and so big that you simply overlook certain things. And secondly, the casino should actually ensure that you are not allowed to make too high a bet under certain conditions. And the profit would have come about if I had only staked €4 per game.</p>
<p>Then this would have been less. But the casino simply says I violated the terms and conditions and simply canceled my winnings and now there are only €250 in my account.</p>
<p>I find that the casino is speculating that the player does not read everything and that you do not receive your winnings even though you have legally won.</p>
