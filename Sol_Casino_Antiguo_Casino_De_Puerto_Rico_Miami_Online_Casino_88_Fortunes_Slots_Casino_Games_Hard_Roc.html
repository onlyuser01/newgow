<p>FanDuel, the largest sportsbook operator in the United States with 33.6% of the market, enters a social-media-driven partnership with digital media start-up WAVE.tv to reach more customers.</p>
<p>Fanduel to Engage More Fans on Socia Media</p>
<p>WAVE.tv reaches more than 400 million people every month. It is a conglomerate of 24 brands like FTBL and Slapshot, engaging fans on social media platforms. The company has connections with more than 110 right holders and leagues from organizations like MLB and more niche sports like karate, badminton, and wood-chopping.</p>
<p>WAVE’s income comes from advertising. Now it also includes collaborations with brands like Miller, Triller, Under Armour, and Lite.</p>
<p>Under the new partnership deal with FanDuel, WAVE.tv will create and launch a new betting media brand with sports wagering content and branded videos. The sportsbook operator will appear on all of WAVE.tv’s social media platforms.</p>
<p>The company has a majority of young fans who have specific interests. It will be beneficial for FanDuel because it offers odds on some high-engagement niche sports. Furthermore, Bettor Capital, founded by FanDuel’s former executive manager, Dave VanEgmond, advised WAVE.tv while making the deal.</p>
<p>WAVE.tv Is Expanding at the Speed of Light</p>
<p>FanDuel’s general manager and vice president of sports content, Adam Kaplan, said that FanDuel has something for everyone, and it is only natural to partner up with WAVE.tv, which has “an unprecedented reach and engagement.”</p>
<p>Recently, WAVE.tv partnered up with the national video network, GSTV, to distribute non-traditional user-generated content from WAVE.tv’s most popular brands like Buckets, Rage Quit, FTBL, and Benchmob. WAVE.tv reaches millions of fans on social media, but this was its first partnership deal that made its content visible outside of its platforms.</p>
<p>Last year, WAVE.tv made an important partnership deal with IMG Media which focused on the young generation of sports fans on social media, who don’t like the traditional experience of sitting and watching a whole game. WAVE.tv gained access to a broader range of IMG’s licensed sports rights to use for its shows.</p>
<p>FanDuel is Looking Forward to Win-Win Situations</p>
<p>The company advocates for legalizing sports betting and calls it a “win-win situation” for the state and the customers. Last month its stock started to rise in the weeks before the Super Bowl as it generated a record sports betting handle of $1 billion in the first 28 days, with which it filled some fiscal holes due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, Fox Corporation owner, Rupert Murdoch, plans to increase its stake in FanDuel, and investing in the growing national sports betting industry as more and more states are legalizing sports wagering.</p>
