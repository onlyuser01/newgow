<p>Cleveland police are continuing to search for multiple suspects late this week in connection with a violent hold-up in a house allegedly used for illicit gambling and other crimes, according to news reports.</p>

<p>Two assailants broke into the Glenville neighborhood residence a few days ago, with one of the robbers stealing about $100 from a 31-year-old victim as he was pistol-whipped.</p>
<p>The duo first entered the residence and pointed guns at those inside. They demanded players get on the floor.</p>
<p>Minutes earlier, a robber jumped out of a car, brandished a gun and stole $40 from a 40-year-old pedestrian on the street close to the gambling house, police told Cleveland.com.</p>
<p>The robber fled in the car. It was described as a 2005 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>Police located the auto a short time later. The four occupants jumped out and scattered.</p>
<p>Two of the bandits that had been in the car ran into the house allegedly used for gambling. Later, police discovered the residence was used for dice games, dominos, and card tables, Cleveland.com reported.</p>
<p>It also held an upstairs bar and another in the basement, the report adds, based on information from city police. Coolers found in the house allegedly contained liquor.</p>
<p>Police said one witness further alleged the house was the site of prostitution, beyond the other illegal activity.</p>
<p>Several occupants in the gambling house also ran out of the house following the robbery.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made so far in connection with the robbery or the illicit activities allegedly taking place in the house.</p>
<p>Eleven Indicted by Grand Jury</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Cleveland, last month a federal grand jury indicted 11 people in what law enforcement described as a “large-scale illegal gambling operation” that was orchestrated through an online betting website hosted in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio claims the 11 individuals acted as bookmakers for individuals wishing to gamble on sports. The alleged scheme was infiltrated by the United States Secret Service and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations unit.</p>
<p>Law enforcement says the bookmakers collected payment by way of gift cards and bitcoin. The indictment says the defendants used an online site based in Costa Rica to track each customer’s bets.</p>
<p>When it comes to legal betting in Ohio, the Buckeye State’s 11 regulated casinos and racinos saw $1.94 billion in revenue during 2019, Cleveland.com reported. The state’s casinos have seen $11.9 billion since the first casino opened in Cleveland in 2012, the report adds.</p>
<p>The 2019 revenue total represents a record for the state. The amount reported by regulators is the total kept by racinos and casinos after paying out winnings for slot machines and table games, Cleveland.com reported.</p>
<p>An estimated $650 million of the revenue will go to the state for yearly payment of gaming fees or taxes, the report adds.</p>
<p>Ohio Considers Sports Betting</p>
<p>Ohio legislators may soon reconsider approving sports betting. Two athletic wagering bills have been proposed.</p>
<p>Both proposals would permit sportsbooks at the state’s casinos and racinos. Mobile sports betting applications could be used anywhere in Ohio.</p>
<p>A House bill would grant administrative authority to the Ohio Lottery Commission. The Senate plan would allow the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) to oversee it.</p>
<p>The OCCC oversees the state’s four casinos, while the OLC also administers the state’s seven racinos that feature video lottery terminals.</p>
<p>Under the House bill, tax revenue from sports betting by the lottery would go to support education. The Senate’s bill directs the tax revenue to the state’s general fund.</p>
