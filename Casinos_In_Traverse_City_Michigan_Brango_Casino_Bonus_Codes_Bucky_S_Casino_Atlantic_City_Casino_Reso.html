    <h1>Casinos In Traverse City Michigan Brango Casino Bonus Codes Bucky S Casino Atlantic City Casino Reso</h1>

<p>It's been going on for 2 months they verified my identification but nothing for my address I do not have a credit card bill I do not have a utilities in my name and I do not have a bank statement my bank is trying to send me a verification letter and I'll see if that will work but I doubt it they've sent me an email at one time saying that they were going to pay me off that was last week they said we'll contacted the payout people and they're going to take care of it this afternoon when I signed on to put in the withdrawal request that's when they let me know that they weren't going to pay me out and I had just got the confirmation from the casino rep a couple hours before. The only bank I had at the time was Green Dot bank I sent them that information as far as government agencies I sent them all kinds I said I'm probably about four different things a letter from the sheriff's office on top of that and then they sent me something saying the letter from the sheriff's office was folded and then all the sudden this time they're saying that the documents aren't clear and they're clear you can see everything on them at first they started telling me to put everything in PDF form so I did that when I did that they said they couldn't take it because it was from a third party third party being the company I used or the app I used to make the PDF. Because they couldn't take a PDF that was emailed to me because it would have been from a third party so that makes absolutely no sense because no matter how I make something a PDF it'll be from a third party then later down the road they advised me they couldn't take anything from drive because they couldn't open it then they asked for me to redo everything including my ID and I did that and gave him all the government documents gave him the Green Dot Bank information yeah they're going to say that I gave them screenshots and in the very beginning the first week I did I had screenshots that I turned into PDFs but I changed all that I took pictures of everything and send it in I sent him in his JPEG and PDF when I sent him in his jpeg they requested them in PDF when I sent him in his PDF they said they weren't clear and they can't be seen they tell me to call customer support for any questions I have and customer support and that is 100% not with the website says it says to verify your address the first thing they're going to do is use a digital model whatever that looks it up and it's got two different databases and if that doesn't work then they would manually verify with paperwork and it definitely says in there that you can use a government document that has your address and then two paragraphs later it says utility bill credit card and then it says any government mail that has your state and address on it and I figured that those were in love not having a bank or not having the utility bill and that was my sister that's my situation I've read the kyc before I gambled on their site and because it said what it said I knew that I had the documentation to verify but I suppose they're going against their own kyc statement that they still have posted it's at the bottom of every single page that you go on next to the AML counterfeiting policy and kyc it says it says it right on there and you can hit it and you'll see where it tells you to send your ID next to six randomly generated numbers then the second ID then utility bill credit card statement bank statement government document or government mail. And the only thing I've been verified for is nothing to do with any casinos it was ID me for the government and the national verifier for Life Link and AC be it's a government program for phones and stuff like that but no I haven't been verified for any casinos or anything like that and I'm assuming that the attachments I sent made it over and those that's their kyc statement and you can see right on there where it says but they won't even address I asked them over and over and no one will respond at all to it's stating that I can use as government documents they won't talk about it and then when I asked him about why did they say I was going to they were going to pay me off they won't talk about that either no one will answer that question in any way shape or form so if you guys could help that would be great and if there's anything else I can get you please let me know</p>
