    <h1>L Auberge Casino Lake Charles Binion S Casino Las Vegas Sam S Town Casino Econo Lodge Lake Elsinore</h1>

<p>I used a coupon code of 'fearless' at Limitless Casino - referencing the following rules:</p>
<p>Bonus: 40% (+20% ON CRYPTO)</p>
<p>NO MAX CASHOUT</p>
<p>Wagering: 1x deposit + Bonus</p>
<p>Max bonus amount: $1000</p>
<p>Games: Non-progressive Slots, Keno &amp; Video Poker</p>
<p>Max bet: $10</p>
<p>I deposited $50 dollars via my credit card and my balance was 80.13 as a result.</p>
<p>I played slot games and won a few bonuses never wagering more than $6.25 meeting the requirements of the no max cashout. I at the time had a real balance of $2,000.00. It even stated withdrawable amount $2,000.00. I requested the withdrawal but had to go through the account verification process. I did this and sent in my documentation. I also followed up with customer service and asked what my allowable amount to withdraw was and was told that I just had to leave the $30 bonus amount on my account, so I did that.</p>
<p>Prior to requesting the verification, I clicked on Black Jack which the system generated a restriction to allowing me to access. Once the verification process started, I was of the impression that the real balance was my balance to use. I clicked on the black jack game and it was now unrestricted so I assumed that I was in good standing with the casino and met all obligations of the coupon rules as well as the terms and conditions. I played black jack as well as slots with my real balance and brought my account real balance down from 2,000 to 1689.</p>
<p>I received another email that I needed to also send my credit card verification in which I did this as well. I then was able to process my withdrawal request to my bitcoin address to which I only requested $1500.00 of the $1689.00 leaving 168.00 on my account.</p>
<p>After making the payout request I received a confirmation email:</p>

<p>Your request number: 3614592</p>
<p>Logging into my account; I see only available is $50.00. If I were to take into consideration what the casino is stating was my violation, then why was black jack restricted and then unrestricted? From what I believe I was within my appropriate usage of the gameplay rules and am entitled to the winnings.</p>
<p>I responded to the pit boss as well as management with my concern that I did not agree and was given exactly the same response. I followed up with a potential negotiation to come to an agreement as I do not find it fair gaming practice to void my winnings based the terms and conditions they claim I violated. The casino knowingly restricted the gameplay during the promotional period and then unrestricted it during the verification process. My withdrawal was approved.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
