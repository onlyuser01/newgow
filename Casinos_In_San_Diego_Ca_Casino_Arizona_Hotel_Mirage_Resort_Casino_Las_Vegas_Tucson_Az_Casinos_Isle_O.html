    <h1>Casinos In San Diego Ca Casino Arizona Hotel Mirage Resort Casino Las Vegas Tucson Az Casinos Isle O</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Please, be informed that hrki99 was indeed a registered account on FortuneJack. As the User withdrew his/her winnings, the withdrawal went under standard security check, where we found that the account under the name hrki99 was associated with another account – mbabic.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Terms &amp; Conditions (T&amp;C) paragraph 2.5 "You are allowed to register only one Account. Registering and operating multiple Accounts (more than one) is strictly prohibited. The Company reserves the right to qualify the account(s) registered on anyone from Your family, household, relative, friend, or otherwise connected person to be Your other Account and, thus, decide that You have multiple Accounts. In case of multiple Accounting, We reserve the right to immediately block and terminate all such Accounts and confiscate all monetary funds available on such Accounts".</p>
<p>In this particular case both users - hrki99 and mbabic were registered under the same IP address (please, find the attached screenshot). Moreover, our fraud team also analyzed users’ behavior and they were very similar.</p>
<p>FortuneJack strictly enforces its policy of not allowing multiple accounts and the User’s association with another account is considered to be illegitimate use of our website. Due to non-compliance with T&amp;C both accounts were blocked. Despite us having the right to confiscate all the funds, our team decided to let hrki99 withdraw the deposit amount back to his wallet, which he did successfully. The decision regarding this case is final and will not be altered in any way as we have all the proof and evidence of the violation.</p>
<p>If you have more questions regarding the complaint, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.</p>
