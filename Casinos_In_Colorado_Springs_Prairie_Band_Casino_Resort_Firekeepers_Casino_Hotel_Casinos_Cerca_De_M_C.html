    <h1>Casinos In Colorado Springs Prairie Band Casino Resort Firekeepers Casino Hotel Casinos Cerca De M C</h1>

<p>Hello.. On July 12th I sent my documents to get verified at El Royale Casino.</p>
<p>They sent a reply(attached) that stated they head received them and I needed to make a deposit for them to verify me. I always send my documents a week or so ahead of making a deposit, mainly so they can't do crap like this. Their Terms and Conditions don't say ANYTHING about having to make a deposit before getting verified. So fast forward to yesterday, I made a small deposit. Won all couple hundred dollars and went to go make a withdrawal, and there's a message saying I can't make a withdrawal because I'm not verified. SO HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THIS CASINO. I email them asking why it says I'm blocked, they reply with they only received them and they couldn't verify them until I made a purchase. Meanwhile, I get another email from someone else telling me I had to do a phone call verification. No problem.. She calls... Answer all her questions. She says everything is good to go and I'm verified.</p>
<p>However, the email I received after that says I have to send another ID picture because because mine has a chip in the corner of it. Also.. They want me to fill out a verification form with all my banking and credit card information? I don't have either of those. I use bitcoin and that's it.</p>
<p>One lady said I was verified, there email says otherwise, and that they couldn't verify me until I made a deposit.. Which again.. Is NOWHERE in they're Terms and Conditions!</p>
<p>Completely stalling and not following their own T&amp;C. I thought this was a decent Casino, but I guess they all lie and do whatever it takes to not payout.</p>
<p>Could you guys please help with this issue? It's only a few hundred bucks I have in there, but I want to withdrawal it and they won't let me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and please let me know if you need anything else from me.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Greg.</p>
