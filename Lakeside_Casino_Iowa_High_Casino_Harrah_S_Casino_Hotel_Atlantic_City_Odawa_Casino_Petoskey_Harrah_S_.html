<p>The Idaho Lottery has confirmed that it will extend its existing contract with Scientific Games, a global supplier of various lottery tickets and solutions, including scratch cards, instant win games, and more. The contract extension will focus on scratch card games, and it will seek to help the Idaho Lottery continue raising funds for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Scientific Games has already had a strong positive impact on the lottery sales of Idaho, helping boost revenue significantly for the 2022 fiscal year. Some of the top-performers here included Million Dollar Blowout and Sapphire 7s.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Lottery Executive Director Jeff Anderson welcomed the opportunity to be continuing on what he described as a successful relationship. The two companies have been able to drive innovation together and Scientific Games has significantly contributed to the Idaho Lotteryâ€™s selection of scratch games, driving revenues, and helping fund education in the state.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is without a doubt one of the most accomplished developers of such titles. It boasts no fewer of 4,000 instant scratch games and has been adding to its portfolio at a rapid pace. The company also has rights to create, and distributed games licensed under The Wizard of Oz and Monopoly brands, which gives Scientific Games even more flexibility when delivering outstanding titles for consumers to explore.</p>
<p>SG President of Americas and Global Instant Products John Schulz also welcomed the opportunity to be extending the partnership with the Idaho Lottery. He assured that Scientific Games has every intention to continue delivering high-performing products across the board which should help players have a great choice and for the lottery to fund educational structures in Idaho.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is certified by the World Lottery Association and it has been in business for decades now, having built some of the most compelling and responsible lottery titles. In fact, the company is represented with more than 130 lotteries in 50 countries. It has been building its North American and global footprints rapidly and presently, Scientific Games is responsible for 70% of all global instant game retail sales, making it a true behemoth in the sector.</p>
<p>The French lottery operator, FDJ, also launched a similar partnership with Scientific Games, having decided that the company is the most powerful ally on the market. Speaking of North America, Scientific Games has won the lottery contract for the Texas Lottery through 2034.</p>
