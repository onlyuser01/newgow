    <h1>Best Online Casino Pa Casino In Mesquite Nevada Where Is Yaamava Casino Black Jack Casino Top Casino</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>There were, as they said, technical problems with the downloads without specifying when they would be solved or anything more, as a result of which days passed without any response from the experts.</p>
<p>After I told them that I have filed a complaint here the problems were magically resolved and they approved some of my withdrawals.</p>
<p>Let me clarify that there has never been any problem with deposits.</p>
<p>Always with withdrawals.</p>
<p>Then there were technical problems again.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that there was no problem and they follow this tactic so that the player bet the money again i.e. breaking nerves and patience.</p>
<p>This happened and I made some withdrawals and bet the remaining amount again, after so much waiting for answers in the chat. They did not give any serious answers.</p>
<p>You also activate the bet block which they give you the option after 2 to 3 days to cancel it yourself, this is something you shouldn't do.</p>
<p>Anyone who makes the mistake of entering this casino like the rest of the same company will only leave as a loser.</p>
<p>Their tactic is that when after a very big loss of money you can hardly win a certain amount, they do everything they can to prevent you from taking it.</p>
<p>Fixed slots and generally fixed as many games as I have chosen, for example you bet €100 if you win €10 and finally if you get €1.</p>
<p>to get the 1€ they will mock you in the chat for days or even weeks with lies and supposed technical problems to lose that and bet and more and...damn it from the beginning.</p>
<p>A lot of attention from the players</p>
<p>What they choose away from this casino.</p>
<p>They are scammers and you should not have a high rating at this casino.</p>
<p>Players to look at player reviews and complaints.</p>
<p>A formal complaint should be made to shut down these casinos.</p>
