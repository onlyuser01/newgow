    <h1>Casino In Massachusetts Casinos Resorts Casino Org Free Slots Casino Attire Horseshoe Casino Indiana</h1>

<p>Thanks to its new agreement with Velvix, the casino will adopt the developer’s West Wanted and Battle Mania games</p>
<p>Velvix, a company that seeks to revolutionize the gaming industry by creating cutting-edge slot machines, has made a foray into California. As announced by the company, two new slot machine titles will be available to customers of Chicken Ranch Casino in Jamestown.</p>
<p>Chicken Ranch Casino is a property that describes itself as “a tiny bit weird, a whole lot of fun.” Thanks to its new agreement with Velvix, the casino will adopt the developer’s West Wanted and Battle Mania games. These are notably the first Velvix titles to be featured at the venue.</p>
<p>Velvix’s West Wanted title will suit Chicken Ranch Casino, considering the latter’s proximity to gold rush towns. The game puts players in the Wild West and engages them with atmospheric music and engaging cowboy-themed gameplay. The machine features exciting mechanics such as the Endless Jackpot Wheel Feature which will keep players at the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Battle Mania, on the other hand, is a game inspired by old school arcade fighting games. It puts players in the shoes of a character called “The Bull,” doing battle with various bosses to collect credits.</p>
<p>Velvix’s content has been quickly gaining traction in multiple jurisdictions, such as Oklahoma and California. The company’s latest deal with the Californian casino comes a year before the opening of a large-scale resort that will be operated by the casino’s ownership tribe. The location is strategically situated between Modesto and Yosemite National Park, making it a perfect destination for tourists.</p>
<p>Velvix Thanked Chicken Ranch for Its Support</p>
<p>Chicken Ranch Casino’s director of gaming, Christoph Phipps, commented on the agreement with Velvix, saying that the deal has been a no-brainer. He said that the casino’s team was immediately drawn to Velvix’s game teams, which are well-suited for the property.</p>
<p>They [the games] speak to our audience and our location very well. We are excited to build a relationship with a new manufacturer, especially as we look to launch our new resort in 2024. Christoph Phipps, director of gaming, Chicken Ranch Casino</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chris Wieners, Velvix’s managing director, thanked the Chicken Ranch Casino team for being very supportive of his company.</p>
<p>The entire team at the Chicken Ranch Casino has been supportive of us as a new manufacturer. Their interest in trying new themes and working with us as they look to build their slot floor footprint is incredibly exciting – I look forward to a long-term relationship with their Tribe. Chris Wieners, MD, Velvix</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Velvix set its sights on Asia, seeking to expand its presence in Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
