<p>The new live casino environment will sport a luxurious Scandinavian atmosphere and will employ professional local live dealers</p>
<p>ComeOn Group, a leading iGaming operator, has unveiled a new bespoke live casino environment for its Ruby Lounge portfolio. The studio is called Nordic Ruby Lounge and, as the name suggests, offers a distinct Nordic atmosphere.</p>
<p>The new studio will broadcast content to all of ComeOn Group’s core markets, allowing players to get a taste of the Scandinavian feeling that the environment offers. In addition to the distinct vibe, the Nordic Ruby Lounge will offer a high degree of customization and personalization.</p>
<p>The studio will sport native live dealers that will elevate the experience for the end customers. It is a part of ComeOn Group’s Ruby Lounge portfolio, which was launched in early 2022. The Ruby Lounge studios all boast premium quality and a strong brand identity statement. They offer superior and safe casino experiences, allowing players to truly immerse themselves in gaming.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group describes the Ruby Lounge studios as studios leveraging a “brands within brands” approach. They offer live Blackjack and Roulette tables presented by experienced live dealers.</p>
<p>What makes the new Nordic Ruby Lounge so special is the customized and personalized touch ComeOn Group has put into it. The studio seeks to become a trendsetter and help its parent company distinguish itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group: the Launch Is an Important Milestone</p>
<p>ComeOn Group described the launch of the new lounge as a great milestone in its growth track. The company’s chief product officer, Cristiano Blanco, commented on the launch, saying that his team is very happy to launch the Nordic Ruby Lounge. According to him, the new studio will “take things to the next level.”</p>
<p>Nordic players can now enjoy a bespoke environment locally tailored around their preferences, with native dealers for that extra cherry on top. It’s been about great teamwork throughout all involved departments, which has landed us in a great quality product with a truly impressive design and functionality. Cristiano Blanco, CPO, ComeOn Group</p>
<p>Blanco concluded that the launch of the new lounge is a “great milestone” for ComeOn Group. The company is looking forward to its success and hopes that it will “take things up a notch.”</p>
<p>The launch of the Nordic Roby Lounge comes a few days after ComeOn Group expanded its Netherlands-oriented partnership with Pragmatic Play. Under the agreement, Pragmatic’s Chroma Blackjack solution went live in the country with ComeOn.nl.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2022, ComeOn Group expanded its leadership team by promoting Sherwin Jarvand to chief data officer.</p>
