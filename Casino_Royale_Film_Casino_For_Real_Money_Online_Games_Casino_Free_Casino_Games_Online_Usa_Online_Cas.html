<p>Is Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks Game 4 of the Western Conference finals going to be the last one of the series? It can be if Steph Curry and the Warriors win again. They’re currently leading the series 3-0, meaning that they just need one more win to seal the deal.</p>
<p>Bookmakers, however, don’t think they’re going to do it. Instead, they think the Mavs will be able to take advantage of the fan support and grab themselves a win on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors are a Step Away from the 2022 NBA Finals</p>
<p>The Warriors are the main favorites for winning the 2022 NBA title in the eyes of the bookies. Priced at -161, they’re given much better chances than the other three teams still in the game.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why that is the case is that the Warriors have been fabulous in the Western Conference Finals. They beat Dallas without any problems in the two games played in San Francisco, after which the series moved to Dallas. Oddsmakers were certain the Mavericks would fight back, giving them the role of the favorite in Game 3 on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The Mavs were five-point favorites ahead of the game, but they ended up losing by nine points (109-100). Once again, the key to Golden State’s win was team play – five of their players recorded double-figures.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Golden State player who scored the most points is Steph Curry. The guy’s been having a vintage season, especially since the start of the playoffs. In fact, we saw him score 20+ points in 12 of the 14 games the Warriors have played in the 2022 postseason so far.</p>
<p>A Must-Win Game for the Dallas Mavericks</p>
<p>If they lose on Thursday, they’re out. The Mavericks know this, which is why you can be certain they’re going to give their utmost in Game 4. Truth be told, some of their players have been giving their utmost already. The best example is Luka Doncic, whom we saw score 40+ points in the previous two games of the Western Conference Finals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Doncic, his teammates haven’t been as impressive. In fact, only three other Dallas players have scored more than 20 points against Golden State – Jalen Brunson and Reggie Bullock in Game 1, and Spencer Dinwiddie in Game 3.</p>
<p>All of them will have to step up in order to beat the Warriors on Tuesday night. The good news is that they will have their fans to give them a morale boost. At home, the Mavericks have been superb this season. In fact, before losing to Golden State on Sunday, they were on a five-game win streak.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks Game 4 Prediction</p>
<p>We think it’s time for the Dallas Mavericks to make things more interesting in the Western Conference Finals. They might not have as good a roster as Golden State, but they will be super motivated to win on Tuesday. With Doncic playing fantastically as usual and his teammates improving their performances, the Mavs should be able to win in Game 4.</p>
<p>Picks: Dallas Mavericks to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
