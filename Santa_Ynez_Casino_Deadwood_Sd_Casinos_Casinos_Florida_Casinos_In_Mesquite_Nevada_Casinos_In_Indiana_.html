    <h1>Santa Ynez Casino Deadwood Sd Casinos Casinos Florida Casinos In Mesquite Nevada Casinos In Indiana</h1>

<p>Initially I signed up to this casino via an affiliate offering a 150% match bonus up to £150. After completing registration (via a landing page showing the offer) I made my £100 deposit and did not receive the bonus. I spoke to support and they informed me I was not eligible for the bonus as I was not linked to the affiliate. Strange considering the sign up journey and also strange that they would not honour the bonus despite me now being an organic player of higher value.</p>
<p>Anyway that their decision.</p>
<p>So now I want to withdraw my funds as I am not keen on spending my money with casino’s that do not honour their offers. Now I am told I have to go through the KYC process, so I send in both documents required. Next day I receive an email saying my account is now verified. I log straight in to my account to make my withdrawal forgetting that my work VPN is on. Now I cannot make a withdrawal because my IP does not match my address. I went on to chat again, explained why this is and then followed it up with an email to support to further explain why I am withdrawing without playing and why my IP does not match my location. 24 hours later and I have not received anything back, despite the CS guy telling me my withdrawal will be handled as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>I understand there are certain things required by the UKGC as I work in this industry, however I believe these tactics used by QueenVegas are simply stalling tactics. My account is not frozen and they will very happily let me play on the site with my deposit and deposit more, but when it comes to withdrawal there are issues with my account and this cannot be processed.</p>
<p>It is casino’s like this that give the industry a bad name.</p>
