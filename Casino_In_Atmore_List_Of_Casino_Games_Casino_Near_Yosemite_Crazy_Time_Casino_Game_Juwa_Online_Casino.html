<p>Innovation-focused and driven game studio Lady Luck Games has released a brand new slot game that is a dedicated and original experience for Betsson Group, one of the biggest operators of online gambling brands around the world, the companies shared via an email press release.</p>
<p>The new partnership sees the rollout of Popeye, a dedicated and highly-anticipated slot experience which was developed exclusively for Betsson. The game has been created as part of a collaboration with King Features, and it’s a significant opportunity for all companies involved in the process – as well as Betsson’s gaming audiences</p>
<p>Popeye, the beloved spinach-chomping sailor, is returning to the casino experience with what is a captivating slot that stands out with excellent gameplay features, immersive gaming, and awesome graphics. Both Betsson Group and Lady Luck Games are confident that Popeye is bound to be a blockbuster title.</p>
<p>LL Lucky Games AB Co-founder and CEO Mads Jørgensen has welcomed the opportunity to see a brand new – and dedicated – slot experience arrive for Betsson. "We're incredibly excited to exclusively release our latest slot game, Popeye, on Betsson. This partnership further solidifies our position as a leading provider of quality games in the industry," the executive explained.</p>
<p>Once again, Jørgensen confirmed that he is confident in the slot’s success and release. The executive noted that Lady Luck Games was very interested to expand its reach with new players and that the Popeye slot is one way to achieve this. Betsson Group Head of Supplier Relations Laura Peretta was similarly pleased with the rollout of this new slot.</p>
<p>The collaboration is a great chance for Betsson to demonstrate that it’s capable of delivering players exceptional gaming that stays with them. "We believe that the Popeye slot, with its iconic characters and engaging gameplay, will be a popular addition to our extensive collection of games," Peretta concluded.</p>
<p>Lady Luck Games, though, is not drawing the line here. The company is preparing to go ahead with more fresh launches that focus on original and bespoke content available to players. Recently, Lady Luck Games introduced its content to Soft2Bet.</p>
