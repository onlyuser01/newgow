<p>AffPapa, one of the world’s leading businesses that brings affiliates and operators together, and the company behind the highly successful and acclaimed iGaming Club event series, has confirmed that it has added Satsport247 to its growing directory of partners. Satsport247 is powered by Betfair, AffPapa notes in the official press release shared with Casino Guru News via email, and has been steadily expanding its reach in Asia where it’s hailed as the best gambling website.</p>
<p>The hallmarks of Satsport247 are those of Betfair itself, as the operator is committed to responsible gambling and focuses on players in a bid to enhance their expeirence and create worthwhile, meaningful, and impactful experiences. This new opportunity with AffPapa is a great chance for both parties as they seek to expand their reach in the market, something that can be achieved by reaching to the existing affiliate partners available in AffPapa’s repository.</p>
<p>Satsport247 did not hesitate to express its happiness and confidence in the success of this collaboration and its significance as a whole:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to announce our partnership with AffPapa. Our team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, ensuring that our users enjoy a seamless and exciting gaming environment, and this partnership brings big opportunities for Satsport247."</p>
<p>For her part, AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan was similarly excited about the opportunity and welcomed Satsport247 to the AffPapa community. The company has shown a tremendous effort in building safe and reliable gambling experiences for its players, Avagyan explained, adding: "We look forward to a successful partnership that will bring new opportunities for both parties."</p>
<p>As for Satsport247, the company maintains a clear commitment to player satisfaction, security and cutting-edge gameplay. The next iGaming Club will be happening in February 2024 in London, which started it all. AffPapa has been able to harness the social format and take it to new heights, starting out small, but quickly finding itself in a position where demand fast outstripped initial capacity.</p>
<p>Things have now been normalized, though, as AffPapa is committed to growing its new flagship event while also ensuring that new operators and affiliates are being added to its ever-growing family of business partners. Recently, the company added JustAffiliates as one of its latest affiliate partners.</p>
