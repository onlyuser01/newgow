    <h1>Harrah Casino Casino In Kansas Live Casino Blackjack Mobile Casino Wynn Las Vegas Hotel And Casino i</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I played at Iwild with a bonus... at the moment the bonus conditions were met, I was at around €500-700 (at that moment the balance should have been reduced, if at all)... after that When the bonus conditions were met, I won another €1200 and was now at €1900.</p>
<p>I applied for the payout, of course sending documents several times by email... and shortly before I finally received the verification confirmation, I received an email saying that a total of €1,050 would be deducted from the €1,200 because it was the maximum amount that could be paid out The bonus is €150...the bonus conditions have already been met and the €1200 was then won.</p>
<p>If the bonus conditions were implemented while there was €700 in the account...how can you deduct more money from me afterwards (that I won with supposedly "cashable" money) than what I won in the bonus... .</p>
<p>Then the casino could still deduct money from me outside of the bonus conditions months later after I have made €50,000 in sales, as happened in this case.</p>
<p>According to the lawyer, it was fraudulent because I was no longer within the scope of any bonus conditions.</p>
<p>Support hasn't responded to my emails for days!</p>
