    <h1>Aviator Casino Riverside Hotel And Casino Fortunes Casino Best Casino In Lake Charles The Orleans Ho</h1>

<p>Veritone Inc and Stats Perform have inked a ground-breaking partnership that is intended at transforming the sports tech industry. The partnership focuses on the development of new AI-powered voice capabilities which will be made available to content creators, brand agencies, leagues, betting platforms, teams, and media organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>This solution will combine the best of both companies, relying on the Opta product developed by Stats Perform and the synthetic voice AI technology that was created by Veritone. The result should be a transformational experience that will realize the full potential of content creation and seek to elevate the way organizations create and people experience sports.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Stats Perform CRO Steve Xeller said that the Veritone technology would enable users to create custom voices in collaboration with trusted broadcasters. The solution is multi-lingual supporting options such as French, German, Japanese, English, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic.</p>
<p>This will enable content creators to reach global audiences and bring them localized entertainment options. Opta will be a huge part of that journey as the platform provides statistically relevant and powerful data that is created in such a way that both informs and engages sports fans.</p>
<p>Veritone Voice will further add to the range and capabilities of Stats Perform’s tool and guide to a way to a better future in which companies are creating compelling experiences for their fans. The news was understandably welcomed by Veritone president Ryan Steelberg, who said that this new collaboration is a truly "tipping point" for the way that sports tech and AI industries collaborate.</p>
<p>He may have a point as this is a powerful solution that promises to create automated and deeply personalized opportunities to deliver even more content and entertainment value. How it can be harnessed remains to be seen, but both companies are confident that this solution can play a pivotal role in content planning and content strategies.</p>
<p>One of the people to comment on this partnership is OneFootball’s own Chief Business Officer Patrick Fischer who was similarly thrilled with the prospect of leveraging this tool with its 100 million fans worldwide. He is confident that the AI voice can be leveraged successfully to reach millions of fans worldwide.</p>
<p>"We believe content that drives engagement and adds to our vertically integrated product will give our fans a reason to return to our app many times per day," he concluded. The convergence of sports and technology has been yielding impressive results for a long while now, and this is now bound to be elevated to a new level through this particular tie-up.</p>
<p>Stats Perform is already well-versed in football, as it introduced its dedicated feeds solution Opta Vision back in 2022-2023.</p>
