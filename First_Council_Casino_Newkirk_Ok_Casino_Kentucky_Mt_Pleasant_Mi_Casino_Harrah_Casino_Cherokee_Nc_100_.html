<p>Georgian players will be able to try out some of the supplier’s best games, which include classics such as baccarat, blackjack and roulette</p>
<p>CreedRoomz, a tech company providing high-quality live casino solutions, has unveiled a new partnership with Lider Bet/Leader-Bet, a Georgia-based iGaming and betting operator. Under the agreement, the former party will fuel Lider Bet’s leading platform with live content.</p>
<p>As announced, CreedRoomz’s full catalog of live casino titles will be integrated into the gaming operator’s platform, expanding both companies’ presence in the local market. As a result, Georgian players will be able to try out some of the supplier’s best games, which include classics such as baccarat, blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>The current partnership is in line with CreedRoomz’s expansion strategy which has seen it actively seek out partnerships with major gambling operators and distributors. Agreements, such as the current one, allow the live casino company to remain ahead of its competition and expand its influence.</p>
<p>Both CreedRoomz and Lider Bet have a wealth of experience in the iGaming sector. Their newly-formed alliance is sure to help them expand their footprint in Georgia while providing local players with engaging and modern iGaming experiences.</p>
<p>Lider Bet has been on the Georgian market since 2008. At first, the company was primarily focused on land-based gaming but in 2010 broadened the scope of its operations and launched online casino gaming products. Currently, Lider Bet owns a number of land-based gambling properties in all of Georgia’s major cities.</p>
<p>CreedRoomz, on the other hand, continues to expand its global presence. In May, the supplier penned a similar live casino agreement with Tom Horn Gaming, an online gaming software provider with an extensive portfolio of casino titles.</p>
<p>The live casino specialist also announced that it will be present at the SiGMA Asia Event on July 20-21, 2023.</p>
<p>Georgia Continues to Evolve as a Major Gaming Hub</p>
<p>In other Georgia-related news, Bragg Gaming Group just launched content in the country thanks to a newly-minted agreement with the Flutter Entertainment-owned operator Adjarabet. Under the deal, Bragg agreed to supply the gambling company with a selection of proprietary and aggregated iGaming titles.</p>
<p>The deal was praised by Bragg Gaming, which was excited by the opportunity to reinforce its existing relationship with Flutter.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, OnAir Entertainment launched a new studio in Georgia, solidifying the country as a major hub for the flourishing online casino industry. The new studio, located in Tbilisi, Georgia, is the company’s third one in Europe and was hailed as a significant milestone in the company’s global expansion plans.</p>
