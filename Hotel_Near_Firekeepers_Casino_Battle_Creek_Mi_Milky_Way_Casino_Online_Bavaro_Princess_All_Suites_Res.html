<p>Sports Information Services (SIS), a leading supplier of 24/7 betting services, has named Conall McSorley as head of international horse racing. McSorley joined SIS only recently but has already been promoted to a position of high responsibility thanks to his experience.</p>
<p>McSorley’s Experience Earned Him a Promotion</p>
<p>McSorley is a seasoned gambling industry worker and has worked for various companies in the sector. Before joining SIS in February 2022, he worked as a business development director for GBE Technologies, a Dublin-based B2B provider. Prior to that, McSorley had a three-year tenure as commercial director of Metric Gaming. His earlier experiences include stints with BragBet, WorldSpreads and Boylesports among other companies. McSorley also currently serves as a consultant for SBF Consultants.</p>
<p>As head of international horse racing, McSorley will leverage his experience to help SIS grow its business and reinforce its horse racing offering. The new head will oversee the delivery of the company’s products, ensuring a new betting event is provided every three minutes.</p>
<p>SIS is renowned for its proven horse racing solution. The company has over 400 clients, some of which are renowned global operators. Bet365 is one of the SIS’ most influential customers.</p>
<p>Byrne Praised McSorley as the Perfect Pick for the Job</p>
<p>Conleth Byrne, product director for SIS, spoke about the new appointment. He explained that the company’s horse racing solution is ever-growing and needs to be constantly overseen.</p>
<p>The ever-increasing scope of our round-the-clock horse racing product is testament to the hard work of the delivery teams at SIS, as well as the clear desire from operators for a seamless end-to-end solution that includes streamed pictures, a complete data feed, commentary, graphics with betting triggers, and an extensive range of prices and derivative markets. Conleth Byrne, product director, SIS</p>
<p>Byrne added that McSorley has the experience needed to manage this robust solution. According to the director, the new head of international horse racing is “the perfect candidate” for the role.</p>
<p>McSorley also shared his thoughts on his new position. He admitted that SIS’ 24/7 horse racing product has deeply impressed him. He is, therefore, happy to have the opportunity to manage these services and help the company grow. McSorley noted that the continued increase in customers attests to the product’s quality and added that he hopes to help SIS evolve even further.</p>
<p>In other news, SIS recently launched another 24/7 product, this time for the esports industry. The betting odds are delivered with the help of Oddin.gg and guarantee superior margins for operators.</p>
