    <h1>Slotocash Casino Login Casino In Shreveport Tualip Casino Casino Bonus Online American Casinos Onlin</h1>

<p>They don't want to give free spins. It started with the fact that in their telegram they posted a post with two promotional codes, it said, I quote:</p>
<p>Activate one or both promo codes to üîç claim NO DEPOSIT 50 FS on Lion Gems</p>
<p>The first promo code '1NY23' did not work due to an error by the site administration, I tried to make a deposit on it but it said 'Promo code not found'. He wrote it at the time when he was supposed to work, on the night of January 1. After a billion mistakes with the first promo code, I decided to try activating the second promo code '2NY23' and it worked! I deposited the required amount of 200‚Ç¥ and started playing, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, the post said</p>
<p>PS No-deposit FS will be credited on 01.01 after 13:00.</p>
<p>But they haven't been there for almost two hours, the first woman in support wrote that you need to wait a little, but an hour later I wrote to support again, where they formally sent me to hell because I didn't activate the first promo code. And now the question is, HOW DO I ACTIVATE IT WHEN IT WASN'T WORKING AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF YOU? It is very unfair because they say one thing and do another. In total, I spent 1,500‚Ç¥, played the slots, activated only the second promo code because the first one was not activated due to a developer error, and they also sent me to hell because the promo code did not work due to their error. I want compensation in the form of free spins, because in this case I know that I am 200% right, because I am not the only one who can confirm that the first promo code did not work. I want compensation for waiting, free spins at a normal rate in a normal slot.</p>
