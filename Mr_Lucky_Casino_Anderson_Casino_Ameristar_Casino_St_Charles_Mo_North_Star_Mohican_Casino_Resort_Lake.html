    <h1>Mr Lucky Casino Anderson Casino Ameristar Casino St Charles Mo North Star Mohican Casino Resort Lake</h1>

<p>The United Kingdom Gambling Commission, based in Birmingham, was established under the Gambling Act 2005 to license and regulate individuals and businesses that operate gambling services in Great Britain. It has earned a good reputation as an authority that is committed to enforcing its rules and policies with the aim of making gambling safer and fairer for players.</p>
<p>Who is the UKGC and what does it do?</p>
<p>The UKGC is responsible for safeguarding players and the wider public by ensuring gambling is safe and fair. It aims to protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed by gambling, strives to ensure that players are more informed, and to keep crime out of gambling. One way the commission achieves these aims is by licensing gambling businesses and making sure that strict regulations have been established, and are being adhered to.</p>
<p>Note: Any gambling websites which trade or advertise to customers in Britain must have a license from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission</p>
<p>For an online casino to obtain and keep a license from the UKGC, there are many specific criteria that must be met. For example, certain information must be made available to the player at all times, regarding:</p>
<p>any transactions that are made</p>
<p>the time that is spent gambling</p>
<p>how a player can set limits on deposits or the amount spent</p>
<p>how to take a break from gambling</p>
<p>Online casinos must also have terms and conditions that are clear and fair, provide information about any fees that might be applicable to the player, and make information available about how to gamble safely and how your money is protected in case the business fails or goes into liquidation. There are also rules regarding what a gambling operator can and can't do in relation to bonuses and promotions. For example, a player should always be able to walk away from playing at any time, and keep what is left of their deposit and any winnings earned from play with their deposit.</p>
<p>With regards to responsible gambling, The UKGC works closely with a number of organizations and charities, such as The Advisory Board for Safer Gambling, in order to make sure that problem gambling is adequately understood and researched, and to ensure that their policies elicit responsible behaviour from license holders towards their customers.</p>
