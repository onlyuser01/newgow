    <h1>Best Casino In Detroit Seminole Hard Rock Casino Apache Gold Casino Hotels With Casinos Near Me Bilo</h1>

<p>Dear Vaggelis,</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and details, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions and bonus terms and conditions - there are strong and reasonable grounds to believe we are talking about multiple account use, which is forbidden, and also about bonus abuse. Only one account and one bonus are allowed per player, and according to the provided evidence in combination with your claims and inconsistencies between the versions you provided, it would be very difficult or even impossible to prove that you did not play with both connected accounts. Apart from that, there is another thing. I asked you to provide me with the communication where the casino informed you about account closure since you claimed it was due to using another IP address. You have not provided me with it, and you even changed your explanation again - in your last post, you claimed that the casino did not inform you about any reason. In addition, players play with real money first when playing with an active bonus. It means you played your real money deposit away before you started playing with bonus funds, and you are not entitled to the winnings obtained from this bonus due to a breach of the rules. Thus, there remained nothing the casino could return to you back.</p>
<p>Each player is obliged to read the terms and conditions and comply with them, and you accepted them upon registration. The casino acted correctly, in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that regulates the casino. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Casinoin team, for your help and cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
