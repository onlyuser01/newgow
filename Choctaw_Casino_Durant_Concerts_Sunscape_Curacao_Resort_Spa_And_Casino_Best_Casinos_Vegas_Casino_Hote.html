    <h1>Choctaw Casino Durant Concerts Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa And Casino Best Casinos Vegas Casino Hote</h1>

<p>I got a 200% bonus in the casino (€ 100 deposited, got 300 ... as far as everything was correct), then I played JamminJars and won € 1200 (at that point my money was gone because I had broken rules) .</p>
<p>At every casino, certain games are prohibited during a bonus period ... these are then blocked and not playable ... but not here! First, the list of banned games is extremely long. Second: There is no indication when you click on a "forbidden" game that I have never seen in another casino ... and you can continue to play ... even though you are not entitled to any winnings at this point (But you are still welcome to gamble away all of your money ... at this point you no longer have to pay out! Thirdly: In the account overview my real credit was used up (€ 100) ... with which I also had the € 1200 profit .</p>
<p>For me this is simply fraud ... it will set you a really nasty trap ... who reads through all the games listed (were around 80 and of course the most famous ... so that you can easily read their "Terms and Conditions - Trap "taps.) For me an absolutely dubious casino that wants to make money quickly but doesn't want to pay out. To date I have never had any problems with "bonus conditions" because it was simply not possible "accidentally" to catch such a game because an appropriate notice or block came immediately. Here you are ripped off in a very bad way. Furthermore, it should also be mentioned that there is also a 4 € maximum limit ... which is not pointed out while playing (this is also in no other casino that I know of).</p>
<p>Conclusion: 2 nasty traps in which everyone falls who is not paying close attention.</p>
<p>For my part, I will also go public with this scam and use all the resources that the Internet gives me. Such a casino must not survive and the market is big enough.</p>
