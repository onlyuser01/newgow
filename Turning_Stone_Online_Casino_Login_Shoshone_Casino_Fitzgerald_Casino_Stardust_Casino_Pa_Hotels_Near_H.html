    <h1>Turning Stone Online Casino Login Shoshone Casino Fitzgerald Casino Stardust Casino Pa Hotels Near H</h1>

<p>I have made a deposit at the Casino on a chip mobile. Played the required recycling and verified my account.</p>
<p>But the casino refuses to repatriate my winnings. At first, they kindly kept all my bank details and promised to make a manual withdrawal. I waited more than a week and asked afterwards. Next, they stated that withdrawal was not possible and demanded to make a new deposit with either an online wallet or bitcoin to change the payment method. (I think this is unreasonable because the minimum deposit is € 10 and the recycling is 3 times, in other words I have to pay € 30 to get the winnings for myself)</p>
<p>I have also clearly indicated in the Casino's instructions that it states that "the casino pays out winnings primarily by deposit method, but if this is not possible by bank transfer or even in a different currency (ie Bitcoin). But the casino does not respond when depositing profits the mother can be paid.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to get their supervisors involved, but they have to hear more important things than my problems.</p>
<p>Next, I informed the Casino that I wanted to close my account and attached a section to their account terms and conditions which clearly states that the funds in the account will be refunded using either a deposit method or other possible payment method or even a different currency.</p>
<p>So now my account has been closed and no money has been refunded. Customer service still refuses to pay my profits and supervisors are not interested.</p>
<p>Is there anything left to do? The amount is small, but I still think it belongs to me</p>
