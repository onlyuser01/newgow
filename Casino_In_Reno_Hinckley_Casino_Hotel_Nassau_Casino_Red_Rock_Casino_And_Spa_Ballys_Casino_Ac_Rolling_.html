    <h1>Casino In Reno Hinckley Casino Hotel Nassau Casino Red Rock Casino And Spa Ballys Casino Ac Rolling</h1>

<p>I am reaching out to you as I am having an issue with a withdrawal from rollingslots 14.</p>
<p>Here's the situation:</p>
<p>Player name: liner99</p>
<p>I have been successfully verified since October 22, 2022 (I still have the documents or email I received from the KYC department.)</p>
<p>On Sunday, January 21, I had €2100 pending for withdrawal. These are transferred in increments of €700 each.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago, my withdrawal limit was even raised from €500 per withdrawal to €700 per withdrawal (I also have an email as proof of this.)</p>
<p>I have withdrawn money several times before. The deposit is always made using the same method (either giro pay or credit card) and withdrawal is also always done via the same method, bank transfer.</p>
<p>However, as it stands today, I have not received any information from the KYC department despite contacting them daily since Monday, but have received no response.</p>
<p>When I got in touch with support, they told me:</p>
<p>My account is in verification mode.</p>
<p>This should absolutely not be the case since I was already verified in October 2022 and nothing has changed since.</p>
<p>All the data has stayed the same and nothing has been altered.</p>
<p>I received an email today claiming that the KYC department supposedly sent me an email on February 16, 2023.</p>
<p>This is not true! I still have all the past data and emails and there is no trace of the KYC department needing additional documents.</p>
<p>Still, if that is the case, I have been waiting for responses since Monday 22nd of January about what documents are supposed to be missing or what is currently preventing the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've received no response.</p>
<p>Can you assist me?</p>
