<p>Aspire Global is bringing new products to its platform through Pariplay Ltd, the company’s dedicated game aggregator, with the company signing up FBM Digital Systems. As a result, Pariplay will leverage FBM titles through the Fusion platform with Aspire focusing on three key markets, to name Brazil, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Pariplay managing director Adrian Bailey welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with Pariplay:</p>
<p>“Pariplay is very proud in distributing FBMDS digital content within its network. FBM is a very well-established land-based brand and Pariplay is happy to be providing the right environment to take FBMDS content to a higher level. This strategic alliance is a big win for both parties that shall consolidate their positioning within their respective markets.” Pariplay managing director Adrian Bailey</p>
<p>FBM’s digital division, FBMDS, is the author of a number of iGaming products that have achieved customer recognition in numerous markets. The company specializes in the production of slots and multi-card video bingo along with tailored products that are welcomed by partners and players.</p>
<p>Pariplay and FBM’s Focus on the Same Gaming Markets</p>
<p>The Fusion platform has spearheaded Aspire Global’s growth in the aforementioned markets which are equally important to FBM. Fusion has also facilitated the onboarding from land-based solutions to iGaming options for developers and companies and has helped Amelco in the United States.</p>
<p>FBM Digital Systems CEO Roberto Regianini joined the conversation and said that his company was happy to be teaming up with Pariplay and have access to the opportunities that Aspire Global’s brand now opens up.</p>
<p>“We believe that the FBMDS base of customized and innovative products will aggregate value to the powerful platform of Pariplay, leading to an increase in player engagement in different markets,” Regianni added.</p>
<p>Pariplay has pivoted towards Latin America through several deals already. One was struck with AGT earlier this month and the company broke ground in Colombia in May with Codere.</p>
