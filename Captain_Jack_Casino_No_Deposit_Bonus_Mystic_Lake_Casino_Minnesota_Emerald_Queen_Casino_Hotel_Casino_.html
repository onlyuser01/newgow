    <h1>Captain Jack Casino No Deposit Bonus Mystic Lake Casino Minnesota Emerald Queen Casino Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I hope my email finds you well.</p>
<p>I will try to make this on point as possible as I am really stressed out by what Videoslots casino is making me go through.</p>
<p>I am a verified user for quite a few years already and I have been depositing and done withdrawals smoothly until march 26 2022.</p>
<p>I do not win all the time- and when I won (thought I was lucky,now I dunno) i made a withdrawal in the amount 1201.00 US dollars via skrll. This shouldn't take so long- usually it takes less than an hour so when it exceeded that time, I went to live chat only to be greeted by rebuttals such as it has been escalated and I should be patient.</p>
<p>During this time- I still had some money left in my account decided to play again and I won again! I should be happy- but I was already worried since the first withdrawal hasn't gone though yet. So I decided to break down the amounts that I was gonna withdraw. I made a withdrawal for 20.00US dollars , 1,100.00US dollars, and 500.00US dollars.</p>
<p>Now there's 4 pending withdrawals- and you know what went through? Just the 20 US dollars. And by now, you can just imagine my frustration. Went to live chat again- and was again met by rebuttals of the same kind. What they did though was refunded me the 3 amounts- 1201, 500, and 1100. What was I supposed to do with it? I then consolidated those amounts and made a withdrawal in the amount 2,800.00US dollars. (Left the 1 dollar in my account).</p>
<p>It has been almost 48 hours now and still they haven't given me what is due me.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me in this dilemma.thank you.</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p>Angela N<strong><em>* R</em></strong>*</p>
