<p>Sportradar, a NASDAQ-listed company trading under the ticker SRAD, has formed a new powerful alliance with the International Cricket Council (ICC). The two companies have announced that they will collaborate on a groundbreaking project that will allow the provider of technological solutions to capture live fielding data through a new data collection tool developed by Sportradar.</p>
<p>The solution is deployed on the occasion of the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which is taking in Australia from October 16 through November 13, 2022. This is the first time in the history of the sport that such a solution has been developed and used. According to the partners, the tool will allow cricket fans to feel "closer to the action," no matter where they are around the world.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new data, Sportradar Managing Director for Strategy and Sports Solutions, Sam Taylor, noted that the company wanted to create the "most intelligent cricket platform" available out there. The rollout of this new tool is a step in the right direction, Taylor said, and continued:</p>
<p>"We are committed to delivering innovation and technology to help grow the sport and are thrilled that these game-changing new features are being used for the first time at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup."</p>
<p>The tool will seek to boost engagement and understanding and offer fans a true and testedway to feel more involved with the sport they enjoy and love. Sportradar is particularly proud of this product which is the first of its kind in the world to offer comprehensive fielding data capture and coding.</p>
<p>The data collected by the company includes standard batting and bowling statistics and it uses up to 80 data points per ball bowled in order to ensure that it translates the data quickly, reliably, and accurately. This data is then translated to the ICC’s website and official mobile application in order to help fans track the action in real-time and garner a deeper understanding into what is going on the field.</p>
<p>The data can be leveraged with other entities as well and not just be distributed through the ICC’s fan-facing website. For example, Sportradar explains that the newly obtained data can be readily shared with media outlets via bespoke feeds, or/and broadcasters.</p>
<p>All of this should help offer a better read of the game action, help analysts provide live commentary that makes it easier for everyone to adjust their expectations from the game or even spot the small changes in a game before they have translated into a final result.</p>
<p>The Sportradar tool does not mean to be helpful during live broadcasts or to fans, though. The company has been known to leverage its data with sports teams and leagues, helping them to significantly improve their performance and work out weaknesses. Sportradar’s data can read into players’ strengths and shortcomings and offers training teams a starting point from which they can improve on those. A year ago, Sportradar became an official betting and data partner for the International Cricket Council.</p>
