    <h1>Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Hollywood Casino York Casinos In Albuquerque New Mexico De Niro Casino Fort</h1>

<p>My gaming id is 594****7</p>
<p>I recently encountered a concerning situation with 1xbet, and I believe it's important to share my experience for the benefit of others. Initially, I used a payment scanner to deposit funds, with a friend making a payment of 1500 INR from his bank account. Surprisingly, despite any potential issues with third-party deposits, 1xbet allowed the amount to be credited to my account without any warning or restriction.</p>
<p>Encouraged by my initial success, I decided to play with larger amounts. I deposited 20,000 INR from my Paytm wallet and an additional 8,000 INR using the same method. After placing bets, I managed to accumulate a total profit of 900 INR.</p>
<p>However, when attempting to withdraw my winnings, I encountered unexpected hurdles. 1xbet requested various documents, including a document ID, an app screenshot displaying the operator's name, and my mother's document since the operator's number was associated with her. Subsequently, they asked for account statements for both my friend's 1500 INR deposit and my own account.</p>
<p>What raised my concern was the inconsistency in their approach. Why was I allowed to continue playing and depositing without issue when my friend initially deposited the funds? It only became problematic when I sought to withdraw profits.</p>
<p>The situation escalated when they asked for a photo holding my national ID, with visible emails from their correspondence, and a selfie. Following submission of these documents, they informed me that my account was under verification due to suspicious activity, and I would be unable to withdraw any funds for 180 days.</p>
<p>This extended timeline for investigation seems disproportionate, especially considering the nature of the verification process. I believe my experience raises questions about the transparency and fairness of 1xbet's practices, particularly when users attempt to withdraw profits after depositing significant amounts.</p>
<p>And now, they are not responding to my emails. Their customer service appears to lack proficiency and is marked by rudeness, displaying a deficiency in effective communication and issue resolution. The only directive provided is to wait and contact them again after 180 days. Does it genuinely make sense to endure a 180-day wait period?</p>
<p>I hope sharing this detailed account of my experience will help others make informed decisions and prompt 1xbet to reconsider their procedures for the benefit of their users.</p>
