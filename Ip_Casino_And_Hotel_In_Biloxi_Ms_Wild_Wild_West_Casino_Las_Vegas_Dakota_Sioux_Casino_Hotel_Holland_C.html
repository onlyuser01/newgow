<p>The Novomatic Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, Greentube, joined forces with the leading online gaming hosting provider, Internet Vikings. In a deal announced Wednesday, the global gaming hosting provider agreed to support Greentube's game launch in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest deal, the leading provider of omnichannel gaming content, Greentube, expands further its presence and leverages the services of a proven gaming global hosting leader.</p>
<p>Since its foundation back in 1998, Greentube has been on the path to further growth. Now, the company's Pennsylvania launch represents another major step in its US-facing expansion.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Greentube found a perfect partner in the face of Internet Vikings, considering that the company needed specific hosting featuring "Kubernetes capabilities to manage containerized workloads and services." Responding to the request, Internet Vikings offered a solution called VMware Tanzu, that will fit Greentube's needs for the specific market in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In a statement released on December 21, 2022, Internet Vikings' COO, Kristoffer Ottosson, pointed out that the partnership is significantly important for the company. He added: "From the start, we have been determined to utilize our expertise to provide a solution that matches Greentube's goals now and in the future."</p>
<p>According to Ottosson, the setup needed for Greentube in Pennsylvania was unlike anything else that was done before. Still, he acknowledged that developing specific solutions is a part of Internet Vikings' services. Finally, Ottosson said: "The opportunity to support a pioneering business such as Greentube with customized and new solutions was a welcome challenge for us to demonstrate our expertise."</p>
<p>Rickard Vikström, Internet Vikings' CEO and Founder, added that the company "created a Vmware Tanzu offering for Greentube's new platform in accordance with their request." He pointed out that upon completion of the process, the company intends to deliver this unique service and power the operations of sports betting and iGaming operators in different states.</p>
<p>The new collaboration further solidifies Internet Vikings' presence in Pennsylvania. In fact, Vikström said that the company has a growing number of clients from the state. He said that Pennsylvania was one of the first states where Internet Vikings launched its leading services.</p>
<p>Greentube's CFO and CGO, Michael Bauer, was also excited about the new collaboration with the award-winning global iGaming hosting provider. Sharing his excitement, Bauer said: "We aim to deliver quality, tailor-made gaming content that cannot be easily found elsewhere. In order to execute our plans, we needed a partner that could engage closely in our mission."</p>
