    <h1>Hollywood Casino St Louis Mn Casinos Online Casinos With Free Play Hard Rock Casino Careers Casino I</h1>

<p>I came across a very strange behavior of a popular streamer and wanted to know if anyone has faced a similar situation? What incidents have you had with streamers?</p>
<p>Twitch: TheDoctor 24800 followers. On the channel, several people take turns streaming slots almost every day. I think they are the ambassadors of Gamdom Casino. I've been watching for a long time - they only play in one casino.</p>
<p>There was a money draw on Twitter. Retweet + subscribe to YouTube, like, comment and post a screenshot to Discord. The first 5 people get $50 today. There were a lot of applicants, but I managed to get there before the others. I'm sitting, waiting for my honestly won prize.</p>
<p>12 hours have passed - silence. Since I won for the first time, I didn't find any rules for getting a prize in Discord, I decided to write to the streamer and find out when I get the prize.</p>
<p>The reaction was strange and inadequate - he refused because I asked about the prize (a screenshot of the correspondence will be below). I apologized, explained that it was the first time I had won something and I just didn't know the rules. He said OK, wait.</p>
<p>I'm sitting, waiting for the prize. 8 days have passed...</p>
<p>I decided to write again. He turned to me very politely, said that I had been watching his streams for a long time, I like them (which was absolutely true at that time) and at the end politely asked about the prize. In response, silence.</p>
<p>Today it's been almost 2 weeks, and even to me, stupid, it became clear that I would never get anything. And I wrote for the last time - to say goodbye to this streamer. And express my disrespect to him.</p>
<p>This time I got an answer. And the reaction was again strange and inadequate.</p>
<p>I made the only logical assumption that all these money draws are just a promotion in order to attract viewers to play at the casino. At the same time receive money from advertising. But when you need to give a prize not during the stream and when no one finds out about it, then you can not give money... And I called him greedy. Which in my opinion is true. A person who plays a $200 bet for one spin - 2 weeks cannot give his viewer $ 50. It's just some kind of cosmic greed.</p>
<p>To which he suddenly started telling me how much he donated to charity... I have a question - how does this relate to my prize? Or if he donates to charity, then he can do contests on Twitter, and then not give prizes?</p>
<p>And I do not know if he is donating or not. I can't check it. But suppose he donates. This is all a show-off again. Being kind and good is when someone sees it. The same as giving money away during a stream. And when no one sees, he does not give. He can be himself...</p>
<p>In general, I wanted to ask, maybe I don't understand something? I've never encountered this before. After all, there is an unspoken agreement. Streamers receive money from advertising, contracts, and so on. They make contests, promote their social networks. They attract viewers, and we sometimes win and can also play in the casino. And everyone is happy. But when you are simply deceived and you are forced to humiliate yourself in order to get an honestly won prize, it is devastating. And plunges into a sad mood. For someone, this is probably ridiculous money. But for me it's a significant amount.</p>
<p>This is my negative experience. The only thing that pleases me is that this is the first time I have encountered such a thing and have never heard of it. So this is an isolated case. And most of the streamers are quite adequate good people.</p>
<p>Tell us about your experience with streamers, if you have one. Good luck to everyone!</p>
