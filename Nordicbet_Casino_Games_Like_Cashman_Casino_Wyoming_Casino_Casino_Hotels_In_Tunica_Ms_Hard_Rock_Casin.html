<p>The much-anticipated Betsson launch of its new operations center in Bogota, Colombia has been finally executed. The online gambling group listed on the Stockholm stock exchange has inaugurated its new LatAm headquarters. The launch is part of the group’s continuous strategy of strengthening its presence in South America. The new hub comes to complete an objective set by corporate in 2022 regarding the creation of a Bogota center that would aid the group’s current partners and brands in Colombia, as well as Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico.</p>
<p>Betsson to Continue “Progressive Growth” in the Area</p>
<p>The group’s chief executive officer Jesper Svenson spoke at the launch event, calling Latin America “a special region” and expressing his thrill about the opening of the fresh operations center in the city capital. Svenson also expressed his confidence in the company’s talented team that should further support their ongoing “progressive growth in the region”. He also expressed the group’s focus on bringing its contribution to the development of a gaming industry “based on responsible entertainment”. The LatAm market has already turned into one of the group’s primary revenue streams.</p>
<p>The launch event was attended by prestigious representatives of public and private sector companies including the Fecoljuegos, which is the Colombian Federation of Entrepreneurs of Games of Luck and Chance. Fecoljuegos expressed their honor to be able to affiliate with “one of the most important betting houses in the world” through the voice of president Evert Montero Cardenas. Montero also spoke about the launch of Betsson’s operations center “in the national territory” as further proof of its support to the gaming industry. The president also applauded the group’s proposal to “promote actions of fair play, mutual support, teamwork, and responsibility”.</p>
<p>Organic Growth of 33% in Q3</p>
<p>The group recorded a 33% organic growth during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year. The group reported hitting €200.3 million ($200.7 million) in revenue during Q3 2022. The growth was explained by the expansion to Central Asian, Latin American, Central, and Eastern European countries. In LatAm, Betsson is working on this strategy that relies on geographic diversification and expansion, taking advantage of the generous online sports betting and casino market in the area.</p>
<p>The company also entered the Mexican territory earlier in August, when it launched its online gaming operations via the betsson.mx platform that hosts live casino, online casino games, and sports betting options. Betsson is also the official sponsor of the professional soccer league in Peru as well as the official sponsor of the Women’s and Men’s CONMEBOL Copa America.</p>
