<p>Manchester City Going for the EPL Title</p>
<p>The Cityzens are coming off a 3-0 win over Bayern Munich on Tuesday, which has gotten them very close to securing a spot in the semifinal of the Champions League. What this means is that they can move their focus to the Premier League, where they’re trailing by six points behind table leaders Arsenal.</p>
<p>The good news for Pep Guardiola’s men have played one game fewer, meaning that if they beat Leicester City on Saturday, they will reduce the point gap to just three points.</p>
<p>They got the motivation, as well as the manpower to pull it off. Practically all of their key men and fit and ready for Saturday’s game, the only exception being Phil Foden who’ll probably miss the game. But all the others are ready to go and put on another great performance for their fans.</p>
<p>These guys are undefeated at Etihad Stadium since November and are cruising on a 10-win home streak in all competitions.</p>
<p>Leicester City Desperate for Points</p>
<p>The Foxes are in desperate need of points if they want to stay in the English Premier League. Right now, they’re second from the bottom, with only two points more than the bottom-placed team.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they’re just two points away from the safe zone, but to get there, they need to improve their form significantly. These guys are 0-1-7 in the Premier League in the last five weeks.</p>
<p>But now is the right time to switch to top gear. They need points ASAP and even a single point against Man City on Saturday would mean a lot for this team.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Leicester City Prediction</p>
<p>Anything but a big win for Manchester City would be a huge surprise. Everything is going in their favor ahead of the clash with Leicester City. The last time these two met at Etihad, the hosts won 6-3, and we think something similar might happen this time as well.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester City to win &amp; over 3.5 goals</p>
