<p>After spending nearly three years with Kindred, Wilsby will be parting ways with the company later this year</p>
<p>The global gambling holding that consists of multiple leading brands, Kindred Group, announced an upcoming change to its senior-level team. On Monday, the company confirmed that its current chief financial officer (CFO), Johan Wilsby, will be stepping down from his role.</p>
<p>Kindred revealed that the current CFO will remain with the company by this autumn. Meanwhile, the company has already started to look for a successor to Wilsby. At the time of the announcement, Kindred did not point out a reason behind the senior-level change.</p>
<p>It was back in September 2020 when Wilsby joined the company. Since then, for nearly three years, he played an important role in overseeing strategic and financial processes related to Kindred’s growth. Currently, it remains unclear who may fill the role of CFO. Yet, as with most senior-level changes, it is likely that there will be a transition period that will enable Wilsby to transfer his responsibilities to the new CFO.</p>
<p>“Kindred is a dynamic company and Johan has been instrumental in developing the Group’s corporate function, the strategic execution, as well and contributing to the Executive leadership team.“ Henrik Tjärnström, CEO of Kindred Group</p>
<p>Henrik Tjärnström, Kindred’s CEO, spoke about the importance of Wilsby in the company’s growth. He explained that the current CFO played a pivotal role in the execution of the company’s strategy and helped guide its C-suite. Finally, Tjärnström thanked Wilsby for his dedication, hard work and wished him well in the future.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Johan for his contributions and wish him the best of luck in his future career,“ added Tjärnström</p>
<p>Details about the senior-level change come after recently, Kindred forged a deal with PXP Financial, a global specialist in payment acquisition, as well as data and fraud analysis. Under the terms of the fresh deal, the company will power its operations by tapping into leading solutions provided by PXP Financial.</p>
<p>Before that, Kindred signed a content deal with the fast-growing developer of iGaming content, Booming Games. Under the terms of that deal, the company expanded its portfolio of offerings by delivering engaging and unique games.</p>
