<p>Bubble Bubble 2 Slot Review</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2 is Realtime Gaming 2017’s sequel to the first title in the series released two years earlier. Players who enjoyed the excellent graphics, engaging gameplay, and spectacular bonuses with unique boosters in the original Bubble Bubble game are expected to have an equally fun time discovering the stunning 5×3 slot packed with special features and a massive jackpot of up to 50,000x bet per line.</p>
<p>If you are ready to start brewing some magical potions alongside gorgeous witches Wanda and Winni and scoop up the big wins, check out the rest of our Bubble Bubble 2 slot review online to know just what the game with a Win-Win feature has to offer.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Ready to Brew Up a Storm!</p>
<p>Players are once again summoned to experience the enchanted lands of witch Winni and her cheeky sister Wanda and gradually fall under their spell while experiencing their witchcraft during the spooky season – or outside of it. The game is available all year long at top casinos powered by RTG and it can be played on desktop and mobile while enjoying the same features and premium experience.</p>
<p>Players who have never tried the original title or those who would like a quick reminder of what to expect from the sequel should get ready to be greeted by the two beautiful main characters who are also siblings. The two attractive ladies are ready to cast their spells upon players and help them score big wins. The slot, therefore, revolves around the power of their magic spells and the witches riding their broomsticks while wearing what appear to be Halloween party costumes. As the game unfolds on the beautifully designed reels and eye-catching backdrop, players get to come across even more symbols, magic, and overall more ways to win compared to the first title in the popular series.</p>
<p>The mesmerizing creepy scene can easily be considered more playful than frightening on its own. Players are ushered into what appears to be a haunted house located in a dark and creepy forest where spiders, black cats, rats, bats, potion bottles, candles, witch’s hats, books of spells, and voodoo dolls are all part of the decor. While crayoned with cartoonish elements in mind, the game symbols do a wonderful job of adding to the spookiness that can only come from a night moonlit night.</p>
<p>While mostly dedicated to players who love the spooky season and horror-themed slots in general, Bubble Bubble 2 is definitely on the lighter and more fun side of the tradition rather than the gore-packed releases in the industry.</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game is played on a standard 5×3 grid counting 50 pay lines where players are encouraged to match the right combinations of symbols from left to right across the pay lines to get their hands on the wins. win prizes. All it takes is a minimum of three symbols in a row typically to win. A few of the highest-value symbols will also pay off for a minimum of two of a kind. The list of high-paying symbols includes owls, rats, and witches’ hats.</p>
<p>Low-paying symbols are represented by book spells, love potions, voodoo dolls, and cauldrons. The highest wins are scored when coming across cats and bats, with five identical symbols triggering a reward consisting of 1,000 coins.</p>
<p>The key symbols of the slot are, as expected, witches Winni and Wanda who can be seen popping on the first and fifth reels. Each of them represents the wilds in the game and they can expand in order to cover the entire reel they are on while replacing the rest of the symbols and even taking the role of scatters.</p>
<p>All winning pay lines that involve one of the two sister witches will also be eligible for receiving a 3x multiplier. Seeing both witch symbols land on the same line will reread players with a 9x boost.</p>
<p>The game’s list of scatter symbols also includes magic wands. At least two of these symbols seen showing up randomly on the reels grant players an instant win. Coming across a minimum of three scatters at a time will allow players to select one of them in order to reveal one of the three available free spins special features. Read on to reach the dedicated features section for more information on the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>RTG has once again selected a mischievous soundtrack that does a great job of promoting the creepy and mysterious mood. The burning candles in the backdrop and the rest of the animations also nicely contribute to the theme.</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2 Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is simple and straightforward. After selecting their desired bets using the coin denominations that start at $.01 and go up to $0.25 for a minimum bet of $0.50 minimum bet and a maximum bet of $12.5, players can hit the Spin button to the right and watch the reels move. It is also possible to activate the Speed option for fast-paced action or Autoplay mode after selecting a certain number of automatic spins.</p>
<p>The paytable can be consulted by clicking the vertical Help &amp; Rules tab to the right or the 50 Line Play to the left.</p>
<p>Bubble Bubble 2: Greater Ghost Free Spins Ghost Wild, Win-Win, Wilder Witches Free Spins &amp; Ultra Bewitched Free Spins</p>
<p>The game is packed with cool features that can instantly round up players’ wins. Among them, we can mention the following:</p>
<p>Greater Ghosts Bonus</p>
<p>During this bonus round, the Ghost Wild symbol will replace all the other symbols except for the scatter symbols. The feature rewards players with 20 free games. Also, as many as nine wild ghosts can be seen flying onto the reels once any scatter-based win is paid. The feature can be retriggered, with 20 extra free games being added to the feature after each new retriggering takes place.</p>
<p>Wilder Witches Free Spins</p>
<p>During this feature, players get nine free games. Provided Winni or Wanda are seen popping during the feature, they will cast a spell. Those reels that will be struck by this spell will be turned into the same witch who cast the spell prior to awarding the pay.</p>
<p>In case both witches pop up, they will automatically cast a spell on the mid-reel and transform it into a wild reel, add 33 free games, or both. The feature can also be retriggered, adding nine free games to the current session.</p>
<p>Win-Win Feature</p>
<p>The feature is enabled during the Wilder Witches feature and it awards a bonus when the size of the qualifying win is 10x the bet of the triggering game or smaller. Provided there are no qualifying wins, players get a win of 100x bet. Any other qualifying win will reward players with wins ranging from 5x to 100x bet.</p>
<p>Ultra Bewitched Feature</p>
<p>Players get seven free games when they come across a minimum of one wild symbol. Witch Winni can cover the first reel while Witch Wanda can cover the fifth reel. Both witches can cover their reels during any random spin. The feature is available for retriggering. Each new retriggering episode will add seven free games to the feature.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with the original Bubble Bubble game, you are prone to find RTG’s 5×3 sequel with 50 pay lines equally exciting and rewarding. Play the game to enjoy the win-boosting features, the seemingly upgraded graphics, and overall better gameplay.</p>
