    <h1>Bitcoin Casino Casino Alabama Quality Inn Near Casinos And Convention Center Coeur D Alene Casino Re</h1>

<p>The leading global sports betting and gaming group, Entain plc, announced a new senior-level appointment. The company confirmed on Tuesday it selected Amanda Brown, an experienced executive with significant knowledge, for the role of independent Non-Executive Director. Although the appointment came this week, Entain explained that Brown's role will be in effect as of November 8, 2023.</p>
<p>Currently, she holds a degree in English from Reading University. Throughout her career, Brown held the role of Remuneration Committee Chair and Non-Executive Director at Micro Focus International PLC. Before joining Entain as an independent Non-Executive Director, she was most recently a part of Hiscox plc, a company that specializes in insurance.</p>
<p>During her tenure at Hiscox plc, Brown held the role of Chief Human Resources Officer. In her role, she collaborated with the company's C-suite, providing strategic guidance and expert advice. Back in 2022, Brown stepped down from her role with the company.</p>
<p>Barry Gibson, Entain's Chairman, shared his excitement about the latest appointment in a statement. "On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to welcome Amanda to Entain," he explained. Gibson outlined that Brown brings extensive knowledge and experience after being a part of leading international companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, he praised her board experience as well. Last but not least, Gibson pointed out: "I am confident that her skills and expertise will further enhance the Boardâ€™s ability to support and oversee the delivery of our strategy."</p>
<p>According to Entain's recent statement, upon joining the company as an independent Non-Executive Director, Brown will also become one of the members of its Remuneration Committee. The company explained that currently, Brown doesn't hold any company ordinary shares.</p>
<p>Besides Entain, Brown currently holds other senior-level roles with two different companies. Currently, she is a Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate of the Remuneration Committee at the Manchester Airport Group. In addition, she also currently holds a Non-Executive Director and Remuneration Committee Chair role with Mitchells &amp; Butlers plc.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the extensive experience and knowledge Brown brings would make her an important addition to Entain's C-suite. She delivers a wide range of skills and joins a growing team of experts.</p>
<p>The latest appointment comes after recently, Entain confirmed its plans to scale down Unikrn business-to-customer esports operations. The announcement came in October after Real Luck Group announced a similar move earlier in the month.</p>
