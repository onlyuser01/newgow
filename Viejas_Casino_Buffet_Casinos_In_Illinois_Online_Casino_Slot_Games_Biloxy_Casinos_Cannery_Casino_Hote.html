<p>BetUK has chosen Adebayo Akinfenwa as its new brand ambassador just in time for the upcoming Cheltenham Festival</p>
<p>UK’s fastest-growing sportsbook in 2022 has chosen soccer icon and cult hero Adebayo Akinfenwa to represent it right ahead of the start of the much-anticipated sporting event that will take place between March 14-17, 2023.</p>
<p>Akinfenwa Joins Jockey Legend Scudamore and Golden Boot Winner Sheringham</p>
<p>The betting brand that offers odds for the most beloved sports and greatest sporting events on the planet took the opportunity to announce the exciting partnership with the “biggest-ever ambassador” while presenting its biggest-ever offer for Cheltenham.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the idea of “the biggest-ever offer” for the upcoming festival, the charismatic player known for his muscular physique can be seen in a brief video on BetUK’s Twitter page encouraging players to download the app to benefit from the current offer: bet £20 ($23,67) and get a £60 ($71) free bet.</p>
<p>The ex-Wycombe Wanderers striker that was called the strongest player in the world has already initiated its interesting collaboration with BetUK on March 6.</p>
<p>The player who has joined other iconic brand ambassadors chosen by the operator including champion jockey Peter Scudamore who scooped up eight titles and legendary goal-scorer Teddy Sheringham will be a part of BetUK’s print, radio, social media, and digital ad campaigns promoting the festival.</p>
<p>“Who Doesn’t Love Bayo?”</p>
<p>BetUK’s country manager Matt Bramley has emphasized the amazing popularity that the ex-player nicknamed Bayo continues to enjoy. Bramley further explained that their greatest ever Cheltenham customer offer required their “biggest ever brand ambassador”, which is why they considered Akinfenwa to be the right choice for them.</p>
<p>The manager also stated that the company was thrilled to welcome Bayo to the team. As expected by fans, the player used the “size does matter” card with reference to the strapping body that he is best known for when speaking about the new partnership and its dimensions.</p>
<p>The player who is considered one of the most famous modern English soccer players who never got the chance to play in the Premier League said that he was “massively excited to be teaming up with BetUK” before the head start of the festival.</p>
<p>“The Beast” called the festival “an epic event” while expressing his certainty that the event will benefit from the “strongest start yet”.</p>
<p>Sports bettors will get the chance to access the freshest racing tips and offers on BetUK’s official website and social media pages. Special emphasis has also been put on their Scu Selects podcast.</p>
<p>The latter will present Peter Scudamore’s expertise and tips before the upcoming horse races.</p>
<p>At the end of January, Bet365 announced the launch of Non-Runner No Bet markets for all Cheltenham Festival races. The live markets will enable bettors to confidently place their wagers on all races part of the event.</p>
