<p>Sportsbet.io is diversifying its product portfolio with two new games by SportCaller as part of a new alliance forged with Coingaming Group.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io Now Features Two New Games by SportCaller</p>
<p>Innovating the experience is part of SportCaller’s bread and butter, and continuing in this tradition, the supplier of F2P games has forged a new alliance with Coingaming Group’s dedicated sportsbook brand, Sportsbet.io.</p>
<p>Under the new partnership, SportCaller is releasing two sports-themed games called 4-3 free and bet free 6-6, which will be available on Sportsbet.io as the bookmaker seeks to diversify its offer and introduce products that do not depend entirely on sporadic sports scheduling.</p>
<p>The new games come with brand-new jackpot mechanics, refreshed user interface, and span multiple sports, from cricket to football. Following the pandemic and suspension of sports, Sportsbet.io has ramped up its focus on alternative betting products, including sports games and esports.</p>
<p>Building Products Fit for Sports Fans</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io director of sportsbook Joe McCallum praised SportCaller for its established track record in analyzing consumer data and putting it in the process of product creation, giving the end result in a distinct advantage and appeal.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s the acquisition or retention-focused games, we now feel confident of keeping our players engaged with the Sportsbet.io brand in a fun, fast, and fair way – enhancing the existing experience, and minimizing churn, wherever we set our scene,” McCallum added.</p>
<p>SportCaller director Cillian Barry said that Coingaming and Sportsbet.io were companies that have focused on innovating the experience in their respective fields and that SportCaller “aligned well” with the values upheld by both brands.</p>
<p>Barry added that achieving global success depended on bringing international ambition and local utility together. Part of SportCaller’s success has been the development of peerless geo-location tools, allowing the company to adapt swiftly to any local demands from governments and regulators.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to report that initial engagement has been incredibly positive, so we can’t wait to see how games like 4-3-free and Bet free 6-6 continue to perform across varied regions which, in some cases, represent new markets for us,” Barry continued and explained that the free-to-play segment is here to stay and it benefits business as much as it does consumers.</p>
