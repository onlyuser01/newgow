<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us!</p>
<p>The first withdrawal request was placed on the 12th of June for the amount of 700, and the winnings originated in a free bonus. The second withdrawal request was placed later that day for the amount of 2000, with winnings originating in the third deposit bonus.</p>
<p>The initial withdrawal request was reviewed and approved on the 18th of June for 100. As per our Bonus Rules item 2.1.9. Free Bonus/Spins withdrawal limits, maximum withdrawal amount from free bonus money are as follows:</p>
<p>(i). Basic maximum 100.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were unable to operate the transfer through your preferred withdrawal method so the funds were returned to your balance. Our chat host requested that you submit the withdrawal again via a different method so we could process the transaction and get the funds to you.</p>
<p>As per our Banking Page, we shall honor one payout approval per account, per review and per week. If you submitted more withdrawal requests simultaneously, only one of the submissions shall be subject to review. Since the request for 2000 came after the initial request for 700, it was returned to your balance.</p>
<p>On the 19th of June, a new withdrawal request was placed for 2000, leaving the 100, originating in the free bonus, in the playable balance.</p>
<p>The request for 2000 was reviewed on the 25th of June, and during the review of your play sessions it was found that they were in breach of our Bonus Rules item 3.4. Until the play through requirements have been met, the maximum amount per spin/ bet that can be placed is 5. We reserve the right to decline a withdrawal and void any winnings, if you place a bonus money bet higher than the allowed limit. The bet in question was placed on the game Money Mouse on the 12th of June.</p>
<p>Should you require any additional help or information, please do not hesitate to contact us, we are available 24/7.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
