<p>El Salvador’s national lottery commissioned the supplier to boost its portfolio by developing new region-specific titles</p>
<p>Scientific Games continues its drive to solidify its position as an international leader in lottery systems production and management. The developer expanded its partnership with Lotería Nacional de Beneficencia de El Salvador, the National Lottery of El Salvador, agreeing to develop exclusive new titles and bolster the organization’s instant game catalog.</p>
<p>The Lottery Doubles Down on Winning Products</p>
<p>El Salvador’s national lottery has partnered with Scientific Games since 2017. The global B2B gambling products supplier bolstered the organization’s portfolio of popular instant games substantially, helping it achieve record revenues in 2022. National Lottery of El Salvador president Javier Milian praised the developer, drawing attention to their mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ support… helped us grow 40% last year and achieve an accumulated growth of nearly 400% in the last five years. Javier Milian, National Lottery of El Salvador president</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ products were so popular they even outpaced traditional lottery in profits, motivating the lottery’s decision to double down on that vertical. The organization uses part of the proceeds to fund community-facing health, education, and social programs in the country. Such charitable initiatives have significantly benefited from skyrocketing profits.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Promises Continued Value</p>
<p>According to the latest agreement, Scientific Games will develop exclusive new high-performance products tailored to the local market, following the success of previous hit titles like Mascotas, Safari, Dinero al Instante, and Tragamonedas. Scientific Games president John Schulz was also excited to extend the partnership with the El Salvador lottery, building on their rich history.</p>
<p>We have navigated challenges together over the years, and we are confident that our strong relationship will drive continued success. John Schulz, Scientific Games president, Americas, and global instant products</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ data-driven design has helped the company consistently develop high-value products, bolstering their partners’ offerings by driving continued engagement. Creating the newest titles for El Salvador’s lottery will likely fall to the company’s team in Santiago, Chile. It is the nearest to Scientific Games’ five major global production centers.</p>
<p>The Developer Maintains Its Leading Global Position</p>
<p>Expanding the relationship with the El Salvador lottery is a significant step in ensuring Scientific Games’ continued prominence in Latin America. The developer partners with many other lotteries in the region, but its instant games have proven their worth as some of the company’s most profitable ventures.</p>
<p>As one of the innovators in that space, Scientific Games products are responsible for over 70% of instant game retail sales worldwide, cementing the company’s leading status. Pursuing relentless innovation, the developer will likely continue to make headlines in 2023 as it explores new expansion opportunities.</p>
