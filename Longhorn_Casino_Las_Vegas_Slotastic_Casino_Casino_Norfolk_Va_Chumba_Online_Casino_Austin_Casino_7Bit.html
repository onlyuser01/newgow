    <h1>Longhorn Casino Las Vegas Slotastic Casino Casino Norfolk Va Chumba Online Casino Austin Casino 7Bit</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I found the 7bit casino here on casino.guru. The positive reputation looked good and the exclusive bonus catched my eye.</p>
<p>I followed the link here on casino.guru to their casino site, where you land on a landing page that shows the offered bonus (and how to obtain it - deposit 20€ and use the bonus code that is also mentioned here on casino.guru). After the sign up I typed in the bonus code - it got accepted - and deposited. I didn't receive the bonus though.</p>
<p>After contacting the live chat, they told me I need a special link (I showed them the link from casino guru, screenshot of their own website offering the bonus to me and screenshot of accepted bonus code) to be eligible for the mentioned bonus and they can't credit the bonus to me.</p>
<p>So first of all: I used the link here from casino.guru.</p>
<p>2nd: I got to a landing page which is part of THEIR WEBSITE which offered the bonus to me (how do I got there if I didn't use a link for that bonus?)</p>
<p>3rd: the bonus code was accepted at the cashier.</p>
<p>So this whole link thing is very dubious in the first place (again, how do I get to the landing page of that bonus on their website when not by a link that is directed at that bonus?), but since their own website offered that bonus to me, it's pretty obvious that something on their end didn't work out. First I thought it was some misunderstanding, but after talking to the support (for a whole day) it looks more like it's just a trick to get people to deposit or something, who knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, because of this my trust in this casino is destroyed and since that is the most important thing in online gambling, I want a refund on my deposit. Since they offered that bonus to me (there might be some communication issues between casino.guru's exclusive offer and them, but since their own website offered it to me too, it should be obvious that it's their end) and chose to not add it, I payed for something that was advertised by them but never delivered. This should be simple, but somehow they think they can just keep my money.</p>
<p>It's like going to a bath where a big pool is advertised and you just get a bathtub. Obviously you'd demand a refund (and probably contact the authorities).</p>
<p>I'd appreciate your help on this. I know it's only 30€, but even if I don't get the money back I want others to know that this casino tries to trick customers.</p>
<p>I'll attach the screenshots I mentioned. If you need anything else please tell me.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
