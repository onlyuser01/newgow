<p>8 Golden Skulls of Holly Roger Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game has a femme fatale pirate theme.</p>
<p>Players will go back in time to a world of seafaring buccaneers, only these aren’t the marauders that most will expect. The crew is entirely made up of sultry women wielding swords and a thirst for treasure.</p>
<p>The drama and fresh ocean air of this game make it engrossing to visit and players won’t have any trouble getting into this seductive story.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Cries of gulls and festive accordions create a swashbuckling soundtrack. Players will feel like they’ve just stepped on to the deck of a pirate ship and taken in the view of the sea.</p>
<p>The sexy and deadly women who crew the pirate ship are the stars on the reels. With outfits that range from corsets to low-cut peasant blouses, they do not shy away from using their feminine wiles. With long flowing hair tamed by bandanas, the women look more than capable of taking care of themselves both on the sea, and in a sword fight.</p>
<p>The diamond symbol is another standout, animated with sparkle and depth for an alluring effect. Players will feel a sense of pirate-like glee whenever they land on the reels.</p>
<p>Realistic waves splash over the reels, sloshing with impressive animation quality. This creates a convincing feeling that players are on the high seas, feeling the salt water on their skin.</p>
<p>The backdrop is a breathtaking scene of a sunset over the ocean. The purple waves feel especially dreamy and suit the world of fantasy perfectly.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>This game uses the Megaways system, which means that the number of symbols on each reel is randomised for each of the player’s spins.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded to players for matching symbols in adjacent reels from left to right.</p>
<p>A cascade system is used and symbols that are part of winning combinations vanish. This leaves their positions open for new symbols to fall in.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can appear on all the reels and when players land 4 Scatters. Each additional Scatter symbol gives players 2 more free spins.</p>
<p>Landing 3 or more Firepot symbols awards players a cash prize which increases in size if more Firepot symbols land.</p>
<p>When players land a Mystery symbol, it will reveal a hidden symbol once the spin finishes. This symbol may be any symbol except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Bonus wheel is made up of sections, each of which contains a number of free spins and a multiplier. Players will have the free spins awarded on the Bonus wheel added to any spins that they already have been awarded from triggering a Free Spins round.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.86%, quite above our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility pirate-themed game.</p>
<p>With sky-high RTP and ample volatility, this game is an excellent choice for strategy-conscious players. Add the gorgeous animation and femme fatale pirate crew and it becomes a game that can’t be missed.</p>
