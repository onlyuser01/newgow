    <h1>Online Real Money Casino Casino Game Table Cool Cat Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Tampa Tam</h1>

<p>I can't recommend the casino yet.</p>
<p>€ 40 deposited, get 200% bonus.</p>
<p>Then carefully read the bonus terms and conditions and started playing.</p>
<p>I played 2-3 slots (none of them forbidden, nor listed with a low wager share)</p>
<p>Bonus implemented happily and then had € 670 on the clock.</p>
<p>Then asked for the address for verification and sent all documents (3 days ago)</p>
<p>Request for payment of € 500 1 day later.</p>
<p>Now (4 days after the verification email and 3 days after the withdrawal request) I can no longer access my account, message "Account has been frozen"</p>
<p>When asked, why? There is only the following answer from the chat: The decision is final and irrevocable ''</p>
<p>Hello? How intransparent is that?</p>
<p>for no reason ... suppose because because it doesn't suit them to pay out € 500 to someone who has deposited € 40.</p>
<p>Allegedly I should get my money the days despite the ban, for which no reason can be given to me or probably rather `` may ''</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 3 days are over after the payment, I really fear that she lied in the chat to get rid of me and the money never comes anyway.</p>
<p>Above all, the fact that one cannot give a reason for the freezing is poor.</p>
<p>Sure, a casino can do it anytime for no reason, but that just shows me that something stinks high up here as far as my situation is concerned.</p>
<p>and no: I don't have 2 accounts, broken conditions or anything.</p>
