<p>Dear Optional,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. Do I understand it correctly, that you have accumulated your winnings from a no deposit bonus or a cashback? I have checked bonus policy, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"A No Deposit Bonus is a bonus that has been credited manually or automatically without requiring a deposit to activate it. There are certain restrictions that must be taken into account when playing with a No Deposit Bonus.</p>
<p>The maximum amount that can be won and/or withdrawn from any No Deposit Cash Bonus is 10 times the value of the bonus funds. For example, if a customer receives a No Deposit Cash Bonus of €50 and wins €1000, the customer will be able to withdraw €500 (€50 x 10), and the remaining €500 will be held by Pledoo;"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"The maximum withdrawal from the winnings received from the cashback cannot exceed ten times the amount of the cashback credited to the balance. For example, if you received €100 cashback (or equivalent in your currency), then you can withdraw maximum €1000 (or equivalent in your currency). Any amount exceeding 10 times the size of the cashback credited to balance will be withheld by Pledoo."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits,</p>
<p>we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predatory, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Have you requested a withdrawal of your winnings already?</p>
<p>Were your withdrawals already processed?</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
