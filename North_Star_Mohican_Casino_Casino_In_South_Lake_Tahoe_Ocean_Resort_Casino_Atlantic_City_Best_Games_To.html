<p>The leading developer of gaming solutions that specializes in 3D cinematographic presentation, Betsoft Gaming, announced a new partnership agreement with PepperMill Casino, the entrepreneurial casino brand. Under the terms of the new agreement, the casino will gain access to popular Betsoft games including Thai Blossoms, 88 Frenzy Fortune and Return to Paris.</p>
<p>Announced on Monday, the new collaboration sees Betsoft expand its reach in Belgium. In fact, the new deal complements the company's growing presence in the country. Currently, Betsoft has more than 200 slot titles that have been localized, translated and certified. This makes the company incredibly appealing to the growing market.</p>
<p>In a press release dated July 4, 2022, Betsoft Gaming's Head of Account Management, Anna Mackney, said: "Reinforcing our footprint across newly regulated European countries is part of our strategic development plan." She outlined that the company is looking forward to collaborating with PepperMill casino. In conclusion, Mackney predicted that the new collaboration will be successful.</p>
<p>Anthony Rus, PepperMill Casino's CEO, added: "We are delighted to be working with a leading content provider of Betsoftâ€™s provenance." He outlined that PepperMill Casino offers innovative content for the Belgian players. According to Rus, Betsoft is the perfect fit for PepperMill's requirements within the market.</p>
<p>Initially founded in the Netherlands, PepperMill Casino is one of the landmark casino destinations in Europe. However, the casino's Belgian operations are mostly online. The online casino joined forces with five land-based casinos and currently caters to them under the same brand name.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Betsoft Gaming was founded back in 2006. Operating for more than 15 years, the company earned a reputation of a leading producer of high-quality iGaming content. Betsoft's team of experienced engineers, software developers, account managers, game and graphic designers and 3D animators help the company offer a unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Betsoft seeks to solidify its leadership place within the iGaming industry. Thus, the company continuously seeks new certifications and licensing within emerging iGaming markets. This helped Betsoft establish a solid portfolio of loyal partners. Currently, Betsoft offers its services to many operators within the European and American gaming markets.</p>
<p>Late last month, Betsoft announced the launch of its newest game called Book of Helios. The innovative game combines Greek mythology with magic and treasure-hunting adventures. What's more, the Book of Helios has an RTP of 95.58% and a hit rate in free spins of 51.73%.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in June, Betsoft announced a new deal with iGG's newly launched casino brand, Simsino. As a result of the new collaboration, Simsino will offer the company's leading portfolio of award-winning slots and table games. Such games include the anime-themed Kensei Blades, Alkemor's Elements, as well as classic hits like Weekend in Vegas and The Slotfather.</p>
