<p>Both companies are among the first suppliers to receive the new license after Sweden introduced the new requirements</p>
<p>Push Gaming and Pariplay, two suppliers of gambling content, have received permission to offer their products in Sweden. The B2B companies have officially secured a license from the Spelinspektionen and are ready for the new market requirements.</p>
<p>For reference, starting July 1, 2023, gambling suppliers in Sweden will be required to have a gaming software license before they can offer their products in the country. Since Sweden is a key market for Push Gaming, obtaining such a license was imperative for the company.</p>
<p>For Push Gaming, this new license means that the operator will be able to continue powering operators with games such as Giga Jar, Retro Tapes, Big Bamboo, Jimmin’ Jars and Razor Shark.</p>
<p>Pariplay, on the other hand, will continue powering the biggest local iGaming operators with aggregated content, as well as with games from Wizard Games, its proprietary studio. Under the terms of the license, the company will be able to offer its products undisrupted for the next five years.</p>
<p>Both companies are among the first suppliers to receive the new license.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Glad to Have Secured the Licenses</p>
<p>Representatives from Push Gaming and Pariplay commented on their newly-secured licenses. Fiona Hickey, Push Gaming’s director of new businesses and markets, said that her team is glad that the company will remain in the Swedish market even after the new rules go live on July 1.</p>
<p>According to her, the new license attests to Push Gaming’s commitment to focusing on regulated markets and responsible gaming. She concluded that Swedes will be able to continue enjoying the best games Push Gaming has to offer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pariplay’s managing director, Adrian Bailey, said that Sweden is a key market for his company, which currently aggregates more than 14,000 games from dozens of developers. He said that his team is happy that it will not be forced to exit the country.</p>
<p>We’re committed to keep being the leading aggregator in regulated markets, and look forward to continuing to entertain our Swedish players for many years to come. Adrian Bailey, MD, Pariplay</p>
<p>Bogdan Barbacaru, Pariplay’s head of compliance, also shared his thoughts on the matter, thanking the Spelinspektionen for allowing the company to continue operating in Sweden. Barbacaru said that his team is excited to keep growing in Sweden and continue strengthening its local foothold. He hopes that Pariplay will continue to expand its presence in Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>Speaking of the two companies, Push Gaming just released a new slot game called Dino P.D. Pariplay, on the other hand, recently added Urgent Games to its Pariplay Fusion platform.</p>
