    <h1>Grand Casino Hinckley Hotel Winner Casino Magnet X Net Casino L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles P</h1>

<p>Casino Guru &amp; The Pokies</p>
<p>It is clear the funds are not going to be paid before the 30 days if at all.</p>
<p>I am actually really disappointed in the way The Pokies have handled this. The casino has not only given very limited support but in fact the casino representative has and is still stating the wrong information re the issue despite me telling them different with evidence pertaining to it.</p>
<p>I know Ive said this over and over and over all whilst submitting proof everytime, I would like to make it clear and repost the original conversation I had with Kyle at The Pokies Support.</p>
<p>FACTS:</p>
<p>Before Submitting the withdrawal form I contacted Kyle And advised him. The bank details which were on the withdrawal form are incorrect as that account is now closed. Kyle stated the following</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, there is no way to change your bank details in our system once they have been Unfortunately, there is no way to change your bank details in our system once they have been put into the system"</p>
<p>I then reiterated the fact the bank data was incorrect and that they need to be changed as the funds could not be processed to that account. Kyle then stated the following</p>
<p>" The details that are on the withdrawal will not be sent to this account as I did not deposit via credit card. If i had of deposited via credit card, these details would of been able to be changed But you deposited via payid, so this is where your withdrawal will be sent to as all withdrawals sent via payid a process and sent back to the account which was used to deposit.</p>
<p>I checked this information with Kyle 3 times before. I submitted the withdrawal form and I then went online and spoke with Casper. He also told me the exact same thing. But within 12 hours it was processed to the account they said it would not get processed to.</p>
<p>None of this was my error at all.</p>
<p>The Casino are getting annoyed that I keep hassling them but the frustrating part for me is I have a written letter from Westpac advising the funds have been returned successfully to the senders account but Pokies just keep denying it.</p>
<p>I have since sort some legal advise and I am currently in talks with Gaming Curacao as well as the Gambling body regulator and this isn't something that's just going away.</p>
<p>The Pokies, my adviser has adked me to asking the following questions so if the rep could please respond to the following:</p>
<p>Could you please check with your payment processor and can I please request a copy of the bank transaction. The confirmation that the payment was made to the wrong account successfully. Also theyve asked me to find out what the casinos plan is when the 30 days is over and they still claim not to have received it?</p>
<p>I await your prompt response.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
