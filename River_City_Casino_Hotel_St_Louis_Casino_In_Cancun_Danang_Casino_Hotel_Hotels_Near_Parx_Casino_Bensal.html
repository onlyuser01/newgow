<p>Gambling giant Flutter Entertainment announced that it is parting ways with Mary Turner, one of its non-executive directors. According to the announcement, the Canadian national will officially leave the board at the end of September, ending a three-year tenure.</p>
<p>In addition to departing from her position as a NED, Turner will also resign as chair of the workforce engagement committee. That position will be assumed by Nancy Cruickshank, another non-executive director, starting in October.</p>
<p>Turner is an experienced industry worker who initially served as a corporate director and chair of corporate governance and nominating committee at Stars Group. She joined the company in 2017 and remained on board until its merger with Flutter Entertainment in 2020.</p>
<p>Prior to her time in the gambling industry, Turner worked in senior positions at several other companies. Between 2002 and 2022, she served Mackenzie Financial Corporation as a corporate director. From 2015 to 2017, on the other hand, Turner had a short stint as the senior vice president of finance transformation at Canadian Tire Corporation. From 2012 to 2016, she also served as president and chief executive officer of Canadian Tire Bank.</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment’s chairman, John Bryant, used the opportunity to thank Turner for her “exceptional contribution” to the board. On behalf of his team, he wished her all the best.</p>
<p>Bryant himself is a fairly new addition to Flutter’s team. He was appointed a week ago, replacing the outgoing Gart McGann.</p>

<p>In other news, Flutter Entertainment recently posted its financial results for the first half of the year. The company reported strong growth in revenue and EBITDA, as well as an increase in its overall number of monthly active players.</p>
<p>Flutter’s H1 revenue sat at $6.12 billion, representing a robust 42% year-on-year increase and underpinning the success of the company’s growth strategy. Group EBITDA, on the other hand, hit $1.04 billion. Flutter Entertainment’s monthly players, meanwhile, skyrocketed from 9.6 million in H1 2022 to 12.9 million in H1 2023.</p>
<p>The results were partially attributed to Flutter’s spectacular success in the United States.</p>
<p>In late July, Flutter Entertainment and Fox Corp decided to shut down their joint sports betting venture, FOX Bet. The decision followed multiple disagreements between the two parties.</p>
