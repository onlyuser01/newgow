<p>The millions donated by The Brook signify how casinos can utilize a model to provide fun and serve the public at the same time</p>
<p>America’s largest charity casino, The Brook, announced it has donated more than $4 million to local charities in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Utilizing a Charity Casino Model</p>
<p>The Brook, a casino located in New Hampshire just minutes away from the Massachusetts Stateline operates on a charity-based model and donates 35% of all its gaming revenue to support more than 100 local organizations on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Andre Carrier, chief executive officer of The Brook, explained why the casino which is operated by a company that is 100% owned by its employees was built in the first place.</p>
<p>“Seeing the potential of New Hampshire’s charity casino model is what brought us home to build The Brook,” Carrier said, adding that the millions donated show exactly how the model is being utilized to “provide for essential service organizations in New Hampshire.”</p>
<p>Organizations such as Make-A-Wish New Hampshire, Big Brothers Big Sisters of New Hampshire, Annie’s Angels, and Rockingham Nutrition Meals on Wheels have received more than $8 million from The Brook since 2019 when the casino was acquired by Eureka Casinos, one of only two employee-owned casino operators nationwide.</p>
<p>“Every day, people are confronted by real problems that need to be solved; from hunger to addiction to suicide prevention,” Carrier continued, paying tribute to the “incredible people” at the hundreds of charities in the Granite State “serving these causes.”</p>
<p>Continued Remodelling and Expansion</p>
<p>Carrier was also convinced that the millions provided to fund these essential activities by the company and the “continued remodel and expansion” of the casino serve as an indication of their ambition to contribute even more in the future.</p>
<p>Located 40 miles away from Boston and within an easy drive for most of the people living in Massachusetts and Maine, the 75-acre casino property provides a variety of gaming options, including table games such as blackjack, roulette craps, and Cajun Stud, simulcast racing operating seven days a week, and an 18-table poker room running cash games and giveaways on a daily base.</p>
<p>The casino which offers no slot machines expanded its gaming area earlier in the year and introduced around 500 new gaming machines like Buffalo Gold, Ultimate Fire Link and China Shores to become the first in the state to offer its visitors these popular Historical Horse Racing machines.</p>
<p>Already having the largest sportsbook in New England, The Brook recently invested millions in renovation to add a 300-seat showroom with upscaling capabilities, a scenic outdoor deck area, a grand ballroom and meeting spaces.</p>
<p>Its showroom regularly becomes the scene for musical acts, band tributes and comedy shows, which, together with the millions donated to local charities, serve as an example of how providing entertainment and fun can go hand in hand with doing public good.</p>
<p>After all, The Brook’s motto is ‘Live Free and Play.’</p>
