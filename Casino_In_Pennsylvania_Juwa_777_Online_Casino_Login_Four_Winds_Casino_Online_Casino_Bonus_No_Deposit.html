<p>Juventus vs Napoli is the most interesting matchup of the Italian Serie A this weekend. The game is taking place at Allianz Stadium in Turin on Sunday</p>
<p>Napoli are out of the Champions League, but the Sky Blues from Naples are just a step away from securing the Serie A title. Even if they don’t do well against Juventus, they shouldn’t worry much. Still, they would love to get one over their foes from Northern Italy.</p>
<p>Juventus vs Napoli Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Juventus +188 Draw +210 Napoli +160</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 +120 Under 2.5 -149</p>

<p>Juventus Determined to Improve Their Serie A Form</p>
<p>Juventus are sitting in the No. 7 position right now, which does not lead to either of Euro competitions. The reason behind this isn’t that they’ve been bad in the league this season. On the contrary, their record is 18-5-7, which is better than all teams other than Napoli and Lazio.</p>
<p>The reason why they have just 44 points is that the league deducted some points from them as a fine for a breach of financial regulations.</p>
<p>What this means is that they need to get into a winning mode in Serie A to get themselves into the Euro zone. The bad news is that their recent form isn’t good. They’re coming off back-to-back losses. The good news is that they definitely have the manpower to get to the Top 6.</p>
<p>Napoli are Very Close to Securing the Title</p>
<p>With 14 points more than the No. 2 team, Napoli are almost certainly going to win the Serie A title. Their recent run isn’t that impressive, but that’s probably because their focus was set on the Champions League in the last couple of weeks. But that dream is over – AC Milan knocked them out of the UCL earlier this week.</p>
<p>What this means is that their only focus for the rest of the season is going to be the Italian domestic league. With only eight games left to be played, they need only a few more wins to secure the trophy. So, can they get a win on Sunday?</p>
<p>Juventus vs Napoli Prediction</p>
<p>Juventus are going to be way more motivated on Sunday than Napoli. They need points and they will have their fans to cheer them on from the stands of Allianz Stadium. At home, they’re undefeated against Napoli since early 2018, and we don’t think that’s going to change this weekend.</p>
<p>Pick: Juventus to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
