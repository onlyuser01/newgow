<p>Genius Sports Group announced today it entered into a partnership deal with Scientific Games (SG) to allow access to its LiveData and LiveTrading services excluding US leagues to SG’s OpenSportsTM platform.</p>
<p>Official Data Available via OpenSportsTM</p>
<p>Genius Sports and its sports betting division Betgenius offer their partners access to official data for over 170,000 events each year, and under the terms of the deal, SG would be able to offer the data to every customer which utilizes its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>“This partnership will ensure Scientific Games’ partners get all the benefits of the world’s finest sports content – from maximum market up-time to increased margins – delivered in a way which is tailored to their own specific trading strategy. No matter where in the world you are operating, these are vital components of success in today’s sports betting industry.” Jack Davison, Chief Commercial Officer, Genius Sports Group</p>
<p>The OpenSportsTM platform offers its customers one of the most reliable and versatile sports betting platform, adding value in terms of betting experience, and having built-in functionalities to allow for personalisation to create bespoke services for partners.</p>
<p>“Genius Sports Group offers a vast array of in-game content which will further our already market-leading offering. There is an extremely high fluidity level brought by the sporting calendar, and our technology is unrivalled in matching these levels with the integrity, robustness and scalability that the OpenSports platform provides.” Keith O’Loughlin, Senior Vice President, Sportsbook, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Data to Improve OpenSportsTM Further</p>
<p>Having among its customers gaming operators such as Hard Rock, Wynn Resorts and Flutter Entertainment is a direct recognition of the value the OpenSportsTM platform adds by providing a world-class sports betting experience for players.</p>
<p>“With Genius Sports Group’s LiveData and LiveTrading services being integrated into our solution, the technology continues to evolve and become more exciting to our players.” Keith O’Loughlin, Senior Vice President, Sportsbook, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>The entire portfolio of data provided by Genius Sports is included in the partnership deal, including content from the English Premier League (EPL), NASCAR, Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga, and also from FIBA basketball and FIVB volleyball leagues.</p>
<p>In October, Genius Sports entered into a definitive business combination agreement with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group II. The $1.5 billion deal with the blank-check company will allow the data provider to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) where dMY Technology II is currently listed.</p>
<p>The combination is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain closing conditions, and the payment to Genius Sports shareholders is set to take place in a combination of cash and rollover equity in the new company.</p>
