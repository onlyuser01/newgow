<p>The leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of games catering to the growing gambling sector, Aristocrat Gaming, announced it started the distribution of the first National Football League-themed (NFL) slot machines to casino floors across the United States. The launch was confirmed Thursday and it comes ahead of the kick-off of the NFL's new season, scheduled to start next week.</p>
<p>The distribution of the much-anticipated NFL Super Bowl Jackpots will enable the games to reach gambling venues across the country, allowing sports fans to pick their team out of the 32 clubs. According to a statement released by Aristocrat Gaming, a full list of locations that offer the new games can be found via its NFL slots section on its website.</p>
<p>As a leading company within the gaming and entertainment sector, Aristocrat Gaming supports responsible gambling entertainment. The company encourages responsible gameplay and that is one of its fundamental values. Additionally, Aristocrat Gaming supports clear standards for the gambling sector and rigorous regulation.</p>
<p>Hector Fernandez, Aristocrat Gaming's CEO, shared his excitement about the recent announcement. "After nearly two years of collaboration with the NFL and NFL Players Association, we finally get to see these game-changing machines in action," he said. Last but not least, Fernandez pointed out: "A tremendous thank you to our teams around the world for their collective brilliance to make today possible."</p>
<p>Judging the company's statement, NFL Super Bowl Jackpots will initially arrive for casinos in Nevada, Connecticut, California, Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon, Arizona and Massachusetts. Moreover, Aristocrat confirmed that deployment for further states across the US can also be expected soon.</p>
<p>While the new NFL-themed game will be the first, it certainly won't be the last. Aristocrat Gaming revealed that NFL Super Bowl Jackpots marks the first title in a series of such engaging and thrilling games that are expected to cater to sports fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>The distribution of NFL-themed slot machines comes on the heels of a partnership between the company and Skill Master Pro. Earlier this week, the duo confirmed a new deal for Georgia's Coin Operated Amusement Machine (COAM) market.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, Aristocrat Gaming agreed to deliver games, powering Skill Master Pro's operations in the state. The delivery of six fan-favorite games will be facilitated via the company's MidKnight XTM cabinet. As a result of the deal, the cabinet will become available to partners of Skill Master Pro in Georgia.</p>
