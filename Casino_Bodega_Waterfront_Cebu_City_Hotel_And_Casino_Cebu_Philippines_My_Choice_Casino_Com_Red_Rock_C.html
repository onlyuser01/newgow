<p>November marked a strong month for New Jersey's nine casino hotel properties, judging by gaming revenue figures released by the gambling regulator in the state, the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE)</p>
<p>On Friday, the gambling regulator revealed that last month, the total gaming revenue reported by casinos, racetracks and their partners hit $441.1 million.</p>
<p>New Jersey Gaming Win Hits $441.4M in November</p>
<p>This result marked a slight 0.3% increase when compared to the $439.6 million reported for the same period in 2021. Focusing on the bigger picture, year-to-date results until the end of November showed that revenue was $4.76 billion. This result marked a strong 9.8% increase when compared to the $4.33 billion reported for the corresponding period last year. More importantly, the year-to-date total gaming revenue this year surpassed the $2.5 billion result reported in pre-pandemic 2019.</p>
<p>Last month, licensed gambling operators paid a total of $45.8 million in taxes, marking a slight increase month-over-month compared to the result from October when taxes halted at $45.5 million. DGE’s latest result reveals that year-to-date taxes hit $478.7 million.</p>
<p>Internet Gaming and Casino Revenue Rises</p>
<p>A breakdown provided by the gambling regulator reveals that casino win in November this year hit $214.5 million, marking a 3.7% increase or $7.6 million more when compared to the $206.9 million reported for November 2021. Additional details reveal that table games win last month increased significantly by 10.9% to $57.9 million, while slot machine win marked a 1.3% increase to $156.7 million.</p>
<p>Internet gaming win soared last month, judging by details released by the DGE. Overall, the internet gaming win hit $146.2 million, up by 23.9% or $28.2 million more than the result from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Reports Betting Revenue Plummets</p>
<p>In contrast to the positive results from casino win and internet gaming, sports wagering revenue decreased. Last month, sports wagering revenue hit $80.4 million, marking a staggering 29.9% drop compared to the result from November 2021 when the revenue hit $114.8 million.</p>
<p>Judging by the latest report, the betting handle reported by sports betting operators in November hit $1.10 billion. Not unexpectedly, the majority of the handle was reported by internet sports wagering operators which was $1.03 billion, while retail sports betting operators saw only $69 million in betting handle.</p>
<p>Year-to-date total sports wagering handle was $9,889,036,983. It’s no surprise that the year-to-date online betting handle was $9.14 billion, while retail wagering was responsible for only $745.8 million.</p>
