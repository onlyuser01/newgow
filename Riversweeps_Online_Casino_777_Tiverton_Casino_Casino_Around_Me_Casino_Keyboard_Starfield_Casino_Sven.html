<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have always read the bonuses own conditions and followed those. This next is from the section bonus rules:</p>
<p>a) "Fraudulent Practice" means any fraudulent activity engaged in by you or any person acting on your behalf or in collusion with you, and includes without limitation:</p>
<p>fraudulent chargebacks and rake-back activity;</p>
<p>the use of a stolen, cloned or otherwise unauthorized credit or debit card as a source of funds by you or any other person participating in the same game as you at any time;</p>
<p>colluding with others to obtain an unfair advantage (including through bonus schemes or similar incentives we offer);</p>
<p>any attempt to register false or misleading account information;</p>
<p>any actual or attempted act by you that we reasonably believe is illegal in any applicable jurisdiction, done in good faith, or intended to defraud us and/or circumvent any contractual or legal restriction, whether or not such act or attempt actually causes us damage;</p>
<p>b) "Unfair advantage" includes without limitation:</p>
<p>exploiting a bug, loophole or error in our or any third party software you use in connection with the Services (including any Games);</p>
<p>use of automated players ("bots") or other third-party software or analysis systems; or</p>
<p>Exploiting a "Flaw" as defined in Section 18, in any event either to your advantage and/or to our or others' detriment.</p>
<p>c) "Bonus abuse" includes:</p>
<p>Making a deposit to get a bonus without the activity of the deposited funds</p>
<p>Withdrawal for redeposit</p>
<p>Betting on either side of one event to meet bonus wagering requirements incorrectly</p>
<p>Directing new accounts to your own use</p>
<p>All bonuses are subject to a bonus use limit based on the bonus engine, and unless otherwise stated, should not be used more than 6 times per calendar month, if for any reason an individual player uses a bonus code beyond that. summa's company reserves the right to further investigate the misuse of bonuses and reduce bonus winnings</p>
<p>I have not done other accounts, placed bets for both teams, taken more than 6 bonuses/month, withdrawn money, not taken advantage of any loopholes or technical issues. I simply haven't broken the rules.</p>
