<p>Arsenal vs. Sevilla is one of the most exciting Champions League duels scheduled for Wednesday, November 8</p>
<p>With a little bit of luck, a win for Arsenal over Sevilla on Wednesday, November 8 would mean booking the ticket to the knockout stage of the 2023-24 Champions League for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs team. That seems like good enough motivation for the Gunners to give their best in this game. If they pulled it off, they‚Äôd be able to make the Prem their No. 1 priority until Spring.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Sevilla‚Äôs players will be super-motivated on Wednesday as well. The reason is that they‚Äôre desperate for points in order not to finish the group stage at the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Sevilla Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Arsenal -303 Draw +375 Sevilla +850</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 2.5 -189 Under 2.5 +140</p>

<p>Arsenal Looking Unbeatable at Emirates</p>
<p>Emirates Stadium in North London is Arsenal‚Äôs impenetrable fortress this season. On their turf, the Gunners are 5-2-0 in competitive games in the 2023-24 season. The best thing is that they‚Äôve played already against such heavyweights as Manchester City and Manchester United ‚Äì they defeated both of those.</p>
<p>11 years apart, but Arsenal ran it back to perfection against Manchester City at the Emirates yesterday‚Ä¶üíØüí™üèº pic.twitter.com/dFHT7BfzlD ‚Äî now.arsenal (@now_arsenaI) October 9, 2023</p>
<p>Even before the start of the new campaign, they were brilliant at home. In fact, they‚Äôve been undefeated on home turf since mid-May.</p>
<p>They also have a great record in home matches against Sevilla, although truth be told, these two haven‚Äôt met too many times so far. The last time they met in London was in the 2022 Emirates Cup (a friendly tournament) when we saw Arsenal winning 6-0.</p>
<p>They might not win by such a huge margin this time, but you can be certain the Gunners will go for the jugular on November 8. The English team wants to win this game as it would mean making a giant step toward securing a spot in the next phase of the 2023-24 Champions League.</p>
<p>They wouldn‚Äôt have to worry too much about their remaining two games of the UCL group stage (vs. Lens at home and vs. PSV on the road). Instead, they should be able to focus entirely on the Premier League, where they‚Äôre competing for the No. 1 spot.</p>
<p>Sevilla Desperate for Points in the Champions League</p>
<p>It seems that the Champions League just isn‚Äôt a good match for Sevilla. Instead, the Spanish team seems to prefer the Europa League. This team holds the record for the most Europa League/UEFA Cup wins with seven trophies (four teams share the second spot with three titles each).</p>
<p>Sevilla is the winner of last season‚Äôs Europa League, which is what got the Spaniards to the Champions League this season. But they might return to their favorite continental competition if they finish third in Group B.</p>
<p>Right now, they‚Äôre sitting in that spot with 2 points, which is the same as bottom-placed PSV. Lens is one spot above with 5 points, while Arsenal is practically out of reach with 6 points. That said, Sevilla does stand a chance to finish second, but at the same time, there‚Äôs also a risk these guys could finish last in their group.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs no room for relaxation in Sevilla‚Äôs locker room. Taking some points home from their trip to London would mean a lot to them, but they probably won‚Äôt go all-in on Wednesday. After all, they‚Äôve got Spanish La Liga to think of as well. And that‚Äôs where they‚Äôll lock horns with their city rival Real Betis just four days after the UCL duel with Arsenal.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs. Sevilla Prediction</p>
<p>We think that Arsenal‚Äôs odds are -303 for a reason. This team is better than Sevilla, has more motivation to win, and is playing in front of its own fans. That said, anything but a relatively easy win on November 8 would be a huge surprise.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal to win</p>
