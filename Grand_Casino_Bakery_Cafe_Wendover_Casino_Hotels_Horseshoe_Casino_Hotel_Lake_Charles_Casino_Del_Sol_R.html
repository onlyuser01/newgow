<p>Yggdrasil, a leading supplier of exceptional gaming experiences, has announced that James Curwen, the Chief Online Officer of OPAP, will be succeeding Bjorn Krantz as Yggdrasil’s new Chief Executive Officer, who has announced his departure from the company and will be taking his leave at the end of September, Casino Guru News learned in a press release.</p>
<p>Krantz will help with the smooth transition and passage of responsibilities over to Curwen in the coming weeks before he finally leaves the company with the new CEO stepping into office officially on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Krantz has thanked Yggdrasil for the opportunity to be a part of the company’s journey over the past several years, and he hailed the board’s choice of Curwen as his successor:</p>
<p>"Since day one, my work with Yggdrasil has been focused on transformation, and as the company now enters the next phase of its global developments, it's time for me to hand over the reins. James Curwen is an industry veteran; he will bring invaluable experience and leadership to the company as it enters the next phase of driving sustainable, profitable growth. It's his time to lead."</p>
<p>Itai Frieberger, Yggdrasil’s Chairman of the Board, was similarly pleased to see Curwen agreeing to join the supplier from his current position at the esteemed Greek operator. Curwen makes an ideal fit into Yggdrasil’s own organization and he brings the skill set necessary to take the company to the next level.</p>
<p>Frieberger thanked Krantz for his service over the past four years and his commitment to building and expanding the Yggdrasil brand. Krantz has been with Yggdrasil over the past four years, with he first starting as Division Head of Publishing in 2020 and quickly transitioning to the position of Chief of Global Market Operations in 2020.</p>
<p>He assumed the leadership position in April 2022, taking the reins over from Fredrik Elmqvist, and has helped the company expand its global reach and drive results in established markets. His departure comes shortly after Yggdrasil’s celebration of the company’s 10th anniversary as an innovative disruptor in iGaming.</p>
