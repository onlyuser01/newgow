<p>Under a recent agreement with the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Sportradar will be safeguarding the upcoming Premier League cricket season.</p>
<p>The Indian Premier League Cricket Season’s Integrity Will Be Safeguarded by Sportradar</p>
<p>The sport integrity services provider Sportradar inked an agreement with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Under the agreement, Sportradar will be safeguarding the integrity of the matches of the 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket season. The matches safeguarded by Sportradar will be held in the United Arab Emirates. It will be Sportradar’s task to monitor the matches and report any betting inconsistencies. Furthermore, BCCI will also receive a risk assessment based on previously collected intelligence.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sportradar Integrity Services managing director Andreas Krannich said: “It is an honor to partner with the BCCI for the 2020 IPL season.” He outlined that as a global leader in sports integrity, Sportradar will provide its expertise and support to safeguard the tournaments against integrity-related issues. Moreover, Krannich added that BCCI takes integrity seriously and Sportradar is looking forward to working with them throughout the tournament.</p>
<p>The IPL 2020 matches will be played across three locations in the United Arab Emirates. In the period September 19 – November 10, there will be:</p>
<p>24 matches taking place in Dubai</p>
<p>20 games in Abu Dhabi</p>
<p>12 games will be hosted by Sharjah</p>
<p>Sportradar Continues to Expand Its Coverage</p>
<p>The most recent deal of Sportradar with BCCI clearly shows that the company continues to expand its coverage offering safeguarding services to more sports. Last year, an existing media partnership between Sportradar and NASCAR was extended. Under the partnership, Sportradar was sharing live data by NASCAR to high-end media partners such as the Associated Press and Bleacher Report.</p>
<p>Back in July, Sportradar strengthened an existing partnership with FanDuel for National Football League (NFL) data. As a result, FanDuel received access to official data by the NFL. Back then, Sportradar’s vice president of US sales, Neale Deeley said that FanDuel has been an “excellent partner”.</p>
<p>More recently, in August, Australian athletes spoke out on social media against abuse by gamblers. NBA players, rugby players, and footballers all shared their negative experiences with angry punters. Back then, Greater Western Sydney Giants professional footballer Callan Ward revealed that he even received death threats. In light of those events, Sportradar did not wait long and revealed that it will safeguard professional athletes from social media abuse. Consequently, the company revealed a new product which is tackling online media abuse and ensures player protection. With the help of investigation, prevention, and intervention, Sportradar said that it will reduce online harm and discourage abusive users.</p>
