    <h1>Casino Royale Film Casino Mesquite Nv Tachi Casino California Casinos Phoenix Scottsdale Biloxi Ms C</h1>

<p>Dear Jase198636,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>WHO CAN PLAY</p>
<p>Players from the following countries and their territories ("Restricted Countries") are not allowed to deposit and play real money games: United States of America, United Kingdom, Spain, French overseas territories (Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, Mayotte, St. Martin, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, New Caledonia), Netherlands, Israel, Lithuania, Dutch West Indies, and Curacao, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Gibraltar, Jersey, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldavia, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan. The Casino cannot guarantee the successful processing of withdrawals or refunds in the event that a player breaches this Restricted Countries policy.</p>
<p>However, we accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here (but correct me if I am wrong, please).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
