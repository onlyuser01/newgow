<p>Instant Win Gaming (IWG), a company that specializes in the provision of eInstant and instant win games to numerous lotteries and has more than 20 years of experience in the industry, has appointed Jason Lisiecki as its new Executive Vice President, Global.</p>
<p>The appointment comes at a time when IWG is determined to continue growing its footprint by signing new partnerships with NASPL/WLA-member lotteries and to deliver cutting-edge experiences to players who are interested in enjoying some of the most worthwhile games in the vertical.</p>
<p>Lisiecki will help the company with its North American pivot and the man himself is a well-seasoned industry veteran. He has also been a part of the IWG family for the past five years, which has helped him cut his teeth on the company’s international operations and help him garner an intimate understanding of the company’s business culture and specific needs.</p>
<p>Lisiecki himself has been an influential presence in IWG as he helped a number of lotteries, to wit BC Lottery Corporation, DC Lottery, Kentucky Lottery, Loto-Québec, Michigan Lottery, and many others to develop their eInstant programs over the past years. Before joining the private sector, Lisiecki was a member of the Michigan Lottery and spent eight years with the organization.</p>
<p>He was one of the early champions of eInstant games within the lottery and helped pioneer the vertical in the United States. His appointment and subsequent string of promotions within IWG’s pecking order comes as no surprise, given the man’s experienced background and passion-driven commitment to business development.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new appointment, IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher was very pleased with the promotion and what it would mean for the company as a whole. "Jason has been instrumental to the success of IWG and the growth of the eInstant category in North America. I know he will serve as a highly valuable resource to our customers worldwide," Fisher added.</p>
<p>Lisiecki was equally pleased to progress up the hierarchy and bring what he described as bullishness in the eInstant category. The EVP, Global confirmed that he feels confident in the future of iLottery sales channels and innovation, and he was thrilled to be working with IWG and collaborating with the company’s clients and customers as the company continues to build momentum and unlock new opportunities.</p>
