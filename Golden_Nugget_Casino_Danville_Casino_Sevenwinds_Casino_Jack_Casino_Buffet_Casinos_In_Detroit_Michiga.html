    <h1>Golden Nugget Casino Danville Casino Sevenwinds Casino Jack Casino Buffet Casinos In Detroit Michiga</h1>

<p>This is extremely exhausting that no matter what casinos always win. They can do whatever and everything is customers responsibility. Even when we know that addiction causes also a lot other difficulties such as depression etc. Can it be so difficult that casino would take responsibility in a case where there is clear evidence proofing my words? Casinos can basically always get away with breaking their own terms, not give any explanation, not take any responsibility. And you cant say anything and dont have any rights.</p>
<p>Have they got the emails or not, I still think it tells all about the casino when they see a proof that this email regarding my addiction was sent to correct email, and still decide to take the money. I know there is many casinos that wouldnt do like this in this kind of situations.</p>
