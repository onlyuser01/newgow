    <h1>York Casino Win River Casino Thundervalley Casino Tioga Downs Casino Ac Hotel Casinos New Campaign U</h1>

<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill University announced the 2023 Gift Responsibly Campaign, an initiative that seeks to raise awareness of the risks related to gifting lottery tickets to children and teens. This year’s campaign is supported by 66 lotteries as well as 84 community organizations across the globe, all united to send a single clear message that lottery products are not suitable gifts for children.</p>
<p>The NCPG cited research data, explaining that children who are exposed to gambling are more likely to suffer from problem gambling later in their life. Children are usually exposed to lottery products that are given by adults who are unaware of the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>The 2023 Gift Responsibly Campaign is organized for the sixth consecutive year. The initiative is supported by 100% of the eligible lotteries across the United States, as well as Canada. International lotteries across the globe, along with non-lottery organizations have also joined the campaign.</p>
<p>Moreover, the initiative is backed by the World Lottery Association, European Lotteries and it is endorsed by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. Similar to the campaigns in previous years, the Gift Responsibly Campaign reaffirms the collaborative efforts of lotteries to protect children and young people.</p>
<p>The campaign, running through November and December, will see the participating organizations provide education to communities, explaining the risks associated with gifting lottery tickets to children. The collaborative effort will involve in-store signage, training of retail employees, as well as delivering messages via social media. Ultimately, the 2023 Gift Responsibly Campaign plans to raise awareness and help more adults understand that lottery products are not suitable gifts for teens and children.</p>
<p>Lottery Tickets Are Not Suitable Gifts for Children</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, NCPG’s executive director, spoke about the new campaign, explaining that it comes during the holiday season. He outlined that it is crucial for adults to understand that they shouldn’t gift lottery tickets to children or teens.</p>
<p>Whyte praised the efforts of the organizations and lotteries that showed support for this year’s campaign and will help deliver the important message while raising awareness of the dangers of youth gambling. “The Gift Responsibly campaign stands out as one of the largest international responsible gambling awareness campaigns, underlining our collective commitment to safeguarding youth and promoting responsible gambling practices worldwide,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“With the growing social acceptability and opportunities available for gambling on an international level, it is important to remember that even young people may experience gambling-related problems.“ Jeffrey Derevensky, director of the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors</p>
<p>Jeffrey Derevensky, the director of the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors, added that amid the expansion of gambling on a global scale, it is imperative for adults to understand the impact of the activity on the younger generation. Finally, he said that the new campaign serves as a reminder for adults to stop gifting lottery tickets to children.</p>
