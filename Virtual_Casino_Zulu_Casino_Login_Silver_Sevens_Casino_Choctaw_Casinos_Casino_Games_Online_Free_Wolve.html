<p>Liverpool are traveling to Wolverhampton to try and get their first win on the road in the Premier League in 2023. The Wolves vs Liverpool game is taking place on Saturday, February 4</p>
<p>This season won’t get down in history as Liverpool’s best. The Reds are struggling and the No. 1 reason for that is that their injury list is very long. Still, bookies think the banged-up Liverpool has what it takes to beat Wolves on Saturday. Keep reading our Wolves vs Liverpool betting preview to learn if they’re right to think so.</p>

<p>Wolves Will Do All They Can to Stay Up</p>
<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are above the relegation zone ahead of the Premier League Round 22. They’re on level points with AFC Bournemouth, but they got a slightly better goal difference. This is strange because Wolves have scored only 12 goals so far. This makes their scoring average just 0.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>Their defense, on the other hand, has been alright. This goes especially since Julien Lopetegui has taken over. With him in charge, Wolves conceded more than one goal in the Premier League in just one game. The game in question is the one with Manchester City on January 22 – the Citizens beat them 3-0 at Etihad with a hat-trick by Erling Haaland.</p>
<p>Before that game, they played against Liverpool in the FA Cup and lost just 1-0. It was their second duel in the cup, after their first finished in a draw.</p>
<p>Things Not Looking Great for Liverpool</p>
<p>Liverpool are out of the FA Cup and the EFL Cup. The Reds are sitting in the No. 9 position in the Premier League, with 21 points fewer than table leaders Arsenal. What all this means is that the only chance for Jurgen Klopp’s boys to win a trophy this season is to win the Champions League.</p>
<p>The bad news is that their opponent in the first round of the knockout stage is the reigning champion Real Madrid. The first part of the UCL doubleheader is on the program in some three weeks and the Reds are probably already thinking about it.</p>
<p>That said, they might not be too pumped up for the Premier League, even though they got a relatively easy schedule ahead.</p>
<p>Wolves vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Wolves are horrible in the offense, while Liverpool are missing a number of attackers (Luis Dias, Diogo Jota, and Roberto Firmino). Knowing this, it’s very likely we won’t see too many goals on Saturday. We do think there will be some goals, but probably only in Wolves’ net.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win and under 2.5 goals</p>
