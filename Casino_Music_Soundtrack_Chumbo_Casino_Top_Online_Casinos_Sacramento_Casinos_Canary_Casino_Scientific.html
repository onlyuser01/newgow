    <h1>Casino Music Soundtrack Chumbo Casino Top Online Casinos Sacramento Casinos Canary Casino Scientific</h1>

<p>Scientific Games has deployed a new central gaming system for the national lottery, significantly strengthening its capabilities and onboarding it with the latest tech stack</p>
<p>Latvijas Loto will, as a result, now have access to the AEGIS central system, which is taking over from the legacy technology. AEGIS is better positioned to help the Latvian Lottery to pursue its future growth targets and achieve them.</p>
<p>AEGIS’ Central System Strengthens Latvian Lottery</p>
<p>AEGIS essentially allows for sales of draw-based games, such as Vikinglotto, SuperBingo, Eurojackpot, Latloto 5/35, Keno, Loto5, and many other leading instant games by Scientific Games to be part of the products that the company brings to the local market.</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by Scientific Games president of international &amp; strategic accounts Michael Conforti who hailed the opportunity to see his company collaborate with Latvijas Loto and work on this new central system to drive lottery sales in the country. Conforti added:</p>
<p>The agility of the new system will allow Latvijas Loto the opportunity to grow and add products and distribution channels in the coming decade. Scientific Games’ Michael Conforti</p>
<p>The opportunity to work together was also welcomed by Latvijas Loto chairman of the board Edgars Lediņš who said that the lottery was very happy to have gone ahead with the transference of technological stacks. He described the system provided by Scientific Games as the more advanced of the two. Lediņš added:</p>
<p>Scientific Games continues to provide superior products and services, making our decades-long partnership a true success. Latvijas Loto chairman of the board Edgars Lediņš</p>
<p>Scientific Games to Also Strengthen Latvia Lotto’s Retail Network</p>
<p>According to the official, this new system provided by Scientific Games is one of the few that can significantly enhance data security and support the lottery as it prepares for a new growth chapter that will be marked with a huge focus on responsible gambling, as well as funding education and sports programs for Latvian children and youth.</p>
<p>The new system has been introduced to the company as part of a ten-year agreement with Scientific Games which also covers the delivery and installment of the WAVE X retailer terminals, which will bolster Latvijas Loto’s sprawling retail network in the country.</p>
