<p>Frutz review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This is a fruit themed slot, but with a modern twist.</p>
<p>Players will discover a reel surrounded by carefully- cut paper trees and butterflies. This handcrafted aesthetic is novel and suggests a fantasy arts and crafts world.</p>
<p>The fruit symbols stand out colourfully in their paper forest and players will find their attention zeroing in on them. This is a great game for players looking for a new take on a vintage fruit theme.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a quirky ‘80s mood that will bring to mind retro video games. It’s a cheerful tune, but some players may tire of the upbeat chimes and hit the mute button fairly quickly.</p>
<p>The framing of the reels immediately stands out with the silhouette of a forest crafted from tactile-looking paper. Delicate butterflies have been carefully cut into the paper forest, and every now and then their wings flutter as if the piece of art is coming to life. Closer to the reels, the shapes of trees are cut from green paper, creating the appearance of depth.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are full of fruit symbols that also seem to be handcrafted. Classic red apples, purple plums and yellow lemons are all animated careful folds as if they too have been made specifically for the game.</p>
<p>Overall, the intriguing animation style and whimsical music combine to create the feeling of being in a world entirely made of art.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Frutz is a five reel, five row slot.</p>
<p>Using the Any Way Wins system, this slot pays out for matching symbols in adjacent reels going from left to right.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spins symbol.</p>
<p>The Multiplier symbol will reveal a certain value whenever it lands. The value will then be logged so that it may apply to players’ wins. The multiplier may be x1, x2, x10, x20, x25, x50 or x100.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Free Spin symbols, this will trigger the Free Spins feature. Players will receive 8 free spins for 3 Free Spin symbols, 10 free spins for landing 4 Free Spins symbols, or 12 free spins for landing 5 Free Spins symbols.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, multipliers are added progressively for the length of the feature. Players' wins will be multiplied by the current total multiplier after each free spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>

<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
