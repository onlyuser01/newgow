<p>Hello! On 05.10.2020. around 23.30 my access to my account was temporarily restricted due to a random security check. On 06.10.2020. provide them with the following documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy of ID card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy of bank card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy of phone bill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the bank statement for the respective card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declaration of origin of the funds, containing in my opinion unnecessarily a lot of confidential information, which I will scan and send to you as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On 07.10.2020 I receive a message to provide the following documents:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The last 3 payrolls from my current employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank statement for the last three received salaries</p>

<p>A copy of my tax return for the previous year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract from my investment portfolio or investment account</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After my refusal to provide the requested documents and an offer to transfer the money to my account and close my account, I receive the same automated answer in my opinion ... we kindly ask you to provide the documents in question. I am a player at a fixed limit and tournaments less often, at Pokerstars, I just decided to try their casino, if I had read your review, I would never have done it .... Now we are in a stalemate, I have not broken any casino rules that suggest that my funds should be paid .... but they put me in a situation that means to me, or you provide us with the requested data or your account remains blocked .... This is a living blackmail, for which I plan to file a complaint to The Commission for Personal Data Protection and respectively to the legal successor of the Gambling Commission, namely the NRA .... I will inform you about the developments ... and I am ready to provide you with reliable correspondence between the two parties, which will be available to others. ig in the hall in question ....!</p>
