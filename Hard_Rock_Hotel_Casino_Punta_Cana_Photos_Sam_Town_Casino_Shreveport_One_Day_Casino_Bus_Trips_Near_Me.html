    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Photos Sam Town Casino Shreveport One Day Casino Bus Trips Near Me</h1>

<p>CYBER.BET</p>
<p>I ve been waiting for a month already to get my withdrawal and they are ignoring it. From time to time they anawer to my emails (they have no live chat anymore) that they have the right to prolong the pending period. My account is fully verified (also they call me a vip), i dont use bonuses and there are 0 reasons not to receive my funds.</p>
<p>i had a balance of 7k euros. They did send me 3 times 1000€ (as max is 1000 per withdrawal) and then they just stopped. Im waiting my 4th part of withdrawal for more than a month already. They keep telling ne that i should be patient and that they have the right to prolong the pending time…</p>
<p>Also, they removed sportbetting. Not sure what that means but maybe they decided to close the company and not to pay its players. Their Curacao license is technucally allowing them to do that.</p>
