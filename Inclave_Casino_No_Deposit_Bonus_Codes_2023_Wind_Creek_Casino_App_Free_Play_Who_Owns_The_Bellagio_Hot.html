    <h1>Inclave Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Wind Creek Casino App Free Play Who Owns The Bellagio Hot</h1>

<p>The Battle of Malta online poker tournament series got underway on Sunday, July 10, with $25.5 million. Hosted by GGPoker, this is one of the biggest events in the poker world this month. It will run through July 31, offering participants the opportunity to win big and make sure they have access to some of the most competitive and worthwhile events.</p>
<p>Battle of Malta Rages Online with Solid Prize Pools</p>
<p>The event features 18 headline events and has already seen the completion of the Kings Landing Opener with €110 buy-in and a guaranteed prize pool of €250,000. The main event here comes with a whopping €2.5 million ($2.53 million) to online poker players who wish to participate and show their mettle online.</p>
<p>While Europe has numerous land-based poker events, the Battle of Malta is a continuation of GGPoker’s efforts to keep the industry and community vibrant in the Old World. Europe is definitely interested in poker, as notes GGPoker director of sponsorships and live events John Scanlon. Commenting on the recent event, Scanlon shared his enthusiasm:</p>
<p>GGPoker is proud to partner once again with Casino Malta once more to host the ever-popular Battle of Malta Online. With loads of mid-stakes poker tournaments to choose from, 18 awesome feature events and at least $25.5 million to be won, we know that players will love this year’s series just as much as in previous years.</p>
<p>The event though is not isolated or completely independent. It’s actually connected to the October 2022 Battle of Malta Live Events. This is why people who seek to qualify for the next pow-wow will have the opportunity to play for 25-seat and hotel packages with a total value of €1,555 each.</p>
<p>GGPoker Committed to Making the Game Better</p>
<p>GGPoker has been actively seeking to better poker across Europe and the world. The company introduced the Poker Integrity Council, a body designed to ensure that consumers get the best possible experience playing online through the GGPoker platform.</p>
<p>The Council is investigating fraudulent behavior and attempting to minimize the harm that automated playing algorithms known as bots have on the overall liquidity and poker ecosystem on the platform.</p>
