<p>The ultimate directory for iGaming affiliates and operators, AffPapa, has added a new hand-picked ally to its portfolio with Captain Words now joining the partnership list. Captain Words, which specializes in iGaming content, was founded in 2017 and is dedicated to delivering highly curated iGaming writing for operators, agencies and affiliates.</p>
<p>As it stands, Captain Words combines more than a hundred years of writing and content-creation experience, bringing its nous to the industry by creating relevant, compliant, and optimized pieces of content. Captain Words creates landing page materials, how-to and strategy guides, works on outreach pieces and anything that may be necessary to advance a client’s brand.</p>
<p>Captain Words is committed to bringing the content in a language relevant to a partner’s audiences, with more than 60 supported languages available. Commenting on this tie-up between the two companies, Captain Words CEO Jonatan Parski said:</p>
<p>"Captain Words is thrilled to be working with AffPapa. We’re excited to work with such a powerful and well-known partner within the industry, and we’re confident that it will result in a beneficial relationship."</p>
<p>Parski welcomed the partnership arguing that it provided Captain Words with an opportunity to establish connections and work with new partners from across the affiliate landscape. AffPapa’s Head of Commercials, Yeva Avagyan, was similarly pleased with the development, noting that Captain Words was an important addition to the company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Avagyan spoke confidently that Captain Words will be able to provide affiliates with the necessary standard and quality writing in terms of fact-checking, accuracy, and SEO optimization when delivering content.</p>
<p>"Can’t wait to see the parties involved come together to make this a successful cooperation," Avagyan concluded. Previously, AffPapa established a similar partnership with Craze Affiliates. Casino Guru and AffPapa joined forces earlier this year to collaborate on a variety of player-focused iGaming projects as well.</p>
