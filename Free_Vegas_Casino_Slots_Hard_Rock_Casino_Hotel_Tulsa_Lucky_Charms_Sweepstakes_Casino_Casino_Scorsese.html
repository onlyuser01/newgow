    <h1>Free Vegas Casino Slots Hard Rock Casino Hotel Tulsa Lucky Charms Sweepstakes Casino Casino Scorsese</h1>

<p>The new and innovative live betting and entertainment project has officially obtained a permit to roll out on the regulated market in the province</p>
<p>This follows the license approval from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario Twain Sport received, allowing the Hybrid Sports League and BetGames’ initiative to take root in one of the biggest iGaming and sports betting markets in North America.</p>
<p>Twain Sport’s products have been tied to strong overall results for operators and their sustained growth. The company has launched a number of innovative live offerings and products that are leading to high turnover and a high-frequency format of live sport that has been a success.</p>
<p>These products include the T-Basket and T-Kick solutions focusing on basketball and soccer products with 6,300 matches each month. Thanks to this new license, Twain Sport will have a solid foothold in the region and seek to rapidly scale its offer with companies that may be interested in leveraging these new solutions that dramatically improve the live experience.</p>
<p>Striking Home with North American Audiences on Path to Global Growth</p>
<p>Ontario is also one of the biggest North American markets which should quickly introduce Twain Sport’s products to a huge number of players through local and regulated operators. Twani Sport VP Europe, Asia, and the Americas at BetGames, John-Paul Rowland, has hailed the opportunity to enter the Ontario iGaming market:</p>
<p>The region is growing quickly and showing a lot of potential, as we head into 2023, we feel we’ve arrived at the perfect time.</p>
<p>Rowland added that the specificity of Ontario as a market allows the company to rapidly establish Twain Sport as a “major name” in the live sports ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to get going and see what Ontario has in store for us,” Rowland added. T-Kick is a fairly new addition to the Twain Sport lineup, launched in January, and is now available on time for the company’s expansion in the North American market through Ontario.</p>
<p>Twain sport has been able to achieve a stronger geographical reach and pull elsewhere, through a collaboration with Betway in Africa in early December. Twain Sport is yet to announce what operators it may be teaming up with in Ontario.</p>
