    <h1>Harrah S River Valley Casino Lucky Eagle Hotel Casino Hottest Casino In Vegas Best Casino The Garden</h1>

<p>If Santa and his elves are not your thing, if even Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer won’t cut it for you this Christmas season, worry not, for the good folks at Kalamba Games invite you to a fantasy-themed treasure hunt with their new slot title Goblins and Gemstones. Any resemblance to Dungeons &amp; Dragons is purely coincidental, of course.</p>
<p>The new game is being distributed via Silver Bullet, a partner program to the Relax Gaming platform. It features three distinct mechanics configured to allow for massive volatility and a monstrous win potential of up to 38,800 times the original bet, the company revealed earlier this week.</p>
<p>Nuts and Bolts</p>
<p>The game features a 5×4 slot with 1,024 paylines. You will have to keep an eye on three Collection Meters which can activate three Collection Spins once you have managed to hoard a total of 20 Collection Symbols. And if you think we’ve overused the word “collect”, then you are entitled to our collective apology.</p>
<p>You can increase your chances of winning through the Scatter Split feature which splits a random symbol into two or three. The Paired Reels feature groups the reels into random combinations allowing for huge wins on every spin. If you want to go big, the Expand n’ Lock feature allows you to expand the reels so they can create more possibilities to win. In addition, Goblins and Gemstones offers Kalamba’s signature HyperBonus feature which can fast-track you to the three Free Spins rounds.</p>
<p>No Goblin-Cleaver</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Alex Cohen commented enthusiastically on the game’s “exciting new mechanics and features that will have players engrossed as they try to unlock the gems and treasures inside the vault protected by Goblins.”</p>
<p>Given the nature of the treasure’s guardians, we can assume the game doesn’t feature a collectible Orcrist sword, also known as the Goblin-Cleaver – a fact as unfortunate as it is understandable as that would make Goblins and Gemstones a rather short and unlucrative title.</p>
<p>“We are constantly looking to evolve our games and features and we are really pleased with this high-volatility title packed with chances to win up to 38800x the bet,” Cohen added, justifying our collective disappointment at the fact that we would not be able to wield the fine elven blade that was once held by Thorin Oakenshield.</p>
