    <h1>St Louis Casino Hotel Cannery Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casino Meadow</h1>

<p>Livespins continues to add more companies to its portfolio of live streamed opportunities that elevate the online casino experience and transform spectators into active participants. The company, which focuses on creating a shared experience between viewers and casino streamers, has added FUGASO as the latest partner to its growing family.</p>
<p>Great Stream-worthy Titles by Fugaso</p>
<p>As a result, Livespins streamers will be able to play FUGASO titles and introduce them to sizable audiences, a process that helps boost exposure and awareness for individual brands, and now FUGASO. Moving forward, streamers will have access to a number of excellent titles by FUGASO, including Diamond Blitz, Magnify Man, Sugar Drop, and Running Reels &amp; Running Wins.</p>
<p>A big plus in favor of FUGASO is the company’s rich visuals and gameplay that is built around striking graphics, with strong gamification and an intuitive interface. Livespins is confident that this partnership will help it to further engage with the next generation of online casino players and deliver on the exact content they expect.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Livespins makes it possible to not just watch streams of slot and iGaming, but also engage with the experience and streamers, sending messages, and emojis, and placing wagers in real-time along with other viewers.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen welcomed the opportunity to add FUGASO to the company’s growing portfolio of partners and praised the developer’s fantastic titles, both existing ones and the others that are set to arrive in the following months. Pedersen added:</p>
<p>Content is such an integral part of a slot stream, and that is why we continue to join forces with the best developers in the business so that our streamers have access to the games that players want to watch being played and also bet behind. Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen</p>
<p>Opportunity to Engage with Audiences</p>
<p>FUGASO business development director Robert Metzger was equally pleased with the opportunity and said that Livespins is a pioneer in space and in what it does. Metzger expressed confidence that the company’s products provide streamers with the opportunity to engage with their audiences, where every spin is an opportunity to win together with spectators.</p>
<p>“This partnership will also allow us to get our games in front of an entirely new audience of online casino players and showcase the engaging and entertaining experience they provide,” Metzger concluded. Livespins recently signed a partnership with NetGaming and WynnBet, with the company constantly expanding its reach.</p>
