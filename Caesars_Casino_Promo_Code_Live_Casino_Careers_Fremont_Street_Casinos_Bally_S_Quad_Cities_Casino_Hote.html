<p>Barca Looking for their 12th Straight Win</p>
<p>Sensational is the word that best describes how Xavi’s team has been playing in 2023. Barcelona are without a single loss this year with 11 straight wins, two of which did come after extra time/penalties. However, in each of their last eight matches, Barca won in regulation.</p>
<p>The result is that this team is now sitting confidently at the top of La Liga table, while in the Spanish Cup (Copa del Rey), they’ve booked a place in the top 4.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this team is that their strongest weapon in 2023 has been their defense. In their last seven games, Barca allowed only one goal in total. Their offense hasn’t been as impressive, but with Robert Lewandowski as their No. 9, these guys have been putting away a decent number of goals.</p>
<p>The Red Devils Fear No One</p>
<p>The same as Barcelona, Manchester United have been playing amazing soccer over the last two months. The difference, however, is that their strongest weapon has been their attack. With Marcus Rashford in the form of his life, the Red Devils have scored two or more goals in each of their last seven games in all competitions.</p>
<p>There are some things though that should worry their fans ahead of their trip to Spain. First of all, Man United haven’t faced too many strong teams lately. In fact, in their last six games, they played Leeds and Nottingham twice, as well as Crystal Palace and Reading.</p>
<p>Another reason to worry is that they got some injury woes, especially in the center of the pitch. Christian Eriksen, Donny van der Beek, and Scott McTominay will likely miss Thursday’s game, which could mean problems for the Red Devils as Barca are incredible in the center of the pitch.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Manchester United won’t be able to hold the ball in their possession for a significant period of time on Thursday. Instead of trying to waltz their way into Barca’s box, they’ll have to go with long passes and/or lightning-fast counterattacks. Luckily for them, they got Rashford to make the most of that.</p>
<p>Unlikely for Man United is the fact that the Spanish team to has a nuclear option in the offense with Lewandowski being a player who can score against literally any opponent. Knowing all this, it’s only logical to assume we’ll see goals on both ends on Thursday. But which team will score more?</p>
<p>We think Barcelona. After all, the game is played on their turf, where they’ll have the support of nearly 100,000 fans.</p>
<p>Pick: Barcelona to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
