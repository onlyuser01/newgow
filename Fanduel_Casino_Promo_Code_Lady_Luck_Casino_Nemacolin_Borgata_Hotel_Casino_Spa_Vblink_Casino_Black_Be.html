<p>Asian online betting operator Me88 and professional cage fighter and ex-Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) double champion Conor McGregor have signed a Brand Ambassador deal. According to the new partnership, the UFC icon will turn into the official Brand Ambassador of the operator in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“An Honor to Join Fists with Me88”</p>
<p>The ex-fighter who grew into the biggest UFC star in only four years called it “an honor to join fists with Me88” with the purpose of supporting their brand expansion plans in the region. The legendary mixed martial arts fighter also took the opportunity to express his excitement for being part of the upcoming marketing initiatives from his new position of brand ambassador. McGregor also said that he was looking forward to interacting with more sports fans in the area, taking the opportunity to share his “experience and knowledge in the field.”</p>
<p>The Irish fighter with a net worth of $200 million will work together with the Asian operator to advertise the brand in the region while getting involved in other online marketing tasks.</p>
<p>Me88, a Step Further to Strengthening Its Position in the Market</p>
<p>The gaming operator chose to sign McGregor as its new brand position as a way of further probing its clear intention to strengthen its position as a safe and highly trustworthy sports betting platform via the “play safe with me” tagline together with their commitment to offering superior solutions in terms of options, quality, and security.</p>
<p>The new deal was made possible with the help of a partnership between McGregor’s talent management team and sports and entertainment agency Paradigm Sports, and Me88’s Outlast Sports Entertainment. Me88’s spokesperson James Snider called the organization a “reliable destination platform that serves the best variety of options” for its members. He also praised McGregor’s “dynamic presence as a fighter and personality.” Besides having fought in the most popular fight in the history of combat sports against Floyd Mayweather five years ago, McGregor is also known for his business skills. He is the co-founder of a whiskey distillery in Ireland and other ventures.</p>
<p>Outlast Sports’s chief executive officer Salauddin Sinnakandu expressed his company’s excitement for having played “an integral part” in reuniting one of the greatest online gaming platforms in Asia with the legendary fighter. He added that the new partnership is expected to attract excellent results and even greater opportunities in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In November 2019, McGregor became Parimatch’s Brand Ambassador.</p>
