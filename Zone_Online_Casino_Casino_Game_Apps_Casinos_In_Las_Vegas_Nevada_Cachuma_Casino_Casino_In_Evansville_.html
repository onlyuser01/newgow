<p>Altenar has expanded its presence in the Eastern European and Balkan iGaming and sports betting market with the company signing a new content alliance with Magic Bet in Bulgaria. The partnership is an important part of the supplierâ€™s pivot in the region and its determination to continue delivering state-of-the-art sportsbook and iGaming software and solutions for locally recognized, trusted, and popular companies.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Altenar will deploy its Virtual Sports and interactive bonus offerings with Magic Bet, as the two companies continue to explore further opportunities to work together and strengthen their respective portfolios in the market. Magic Bet is keen to learn from Altenar and work with the company so that the operator may develop its own odds offering along with risk management, and more.</p>
<p>This way, Magic Bet believes it can gain traction in the fast-developing and increasingly lucrative Bulgarian iGaming and sports betting market, offering punters improved odds and better-value fixtures and significantly strengthening its presence across the board.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Magic Bet CEO Plamen Dzhedzhev said that he was eager to partner up with a company that he hailed as a world-class leader in the development of sports betting technology.</p>
<p>"This integration will see us become one of the top online operators within the territory and we are thrilled to be able to offer a wide range of verticals to our customers," Dzhedzhev added.</p>
<p>Altenar Account Manager Panagiotis Lantzas was similarly happy with the opportunity and added that the company is fully committed to Bulgaria as a country and keen to grow its overall presence in the Balkans region as a whole.</p>
<p>"Magic Bet has some ambitious plans ahead and, with our cutting-edge technology, the operator will be able to enhance its success across Bulgaria and we look forward to a fantastic journey with them," Lantzas.</p>
<p>Altenar has been steadily expanding its geographical footprint, aiming at not just markets in Europe, but also Oceania, through a tie-up with SpinBet in New Zealand.</p>
<p>A significant step forward for the company was a partnership with Flows, a platform that allows clients to develop advanced solutions for the iGaming and sports betting industries without the necessity to handle hard code in the process.</p>
<p>Altenar remains committed to rapidly scaling its presence and technological capabilities to help create a rewarding and fun experience across the board for everyone involved.</p>
