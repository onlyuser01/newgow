<p>The organization that is busy crayoning the future of fintech, blockchain, and gaming with services and products that place customers at the center of the universe Yolo Group has announced Joe McCallum as its new director of gaming for Business-to-Consumer.</p>
<p>McCallum is no stranger to the group that he first joined in 2017 as director of sportsbook in Tallinn, Harjumaa, Estonia. Now, some of his old duties will be transferred to betting industry pro Stuart Weston. The latter will join the group as the new director of Sportsbet.io. Besides their shared passion for sports, Weston and McCallum have something else in common: William Hill. Both Weston and McCallum have spent a long time working for the company that focuses on gambling facilities and casinos.</p>
<p>McCallum Will Manage Casino and Sports B2C Departments</p>
<p>In his new position as director of gaming for B2C, McCallum will be responsible for overseeing both the casinos and sports departments belonging to a number of brands. The list includes LiveCasino.io, Sportsbet.io, and Bitcasino. While still a director of sportsbook, McCallum’s role in supervising the growth of the group’s B2C sports betting brand Sportsbet.io has been crucial. Sportsbet.io is Arsenal FC’s betting partner.</p>
<p>Before joining Yolo, McCallum spent five years and nine months working for William Hills as business lead for new sportsbook between July 2014 and December 2016, and head of customer assurance between April 2011 and July 2013.</p>
<p>Weston Spent 18 Years With William Hill</p>
<p>Weston has spent a total of 18 lucrative years with William Hill after he started off as a shop cashier in Stoke-on-Trent in April 1998. He fulfilled his duties as sportsbook operations manager, business development manager, and retail area manager over a period of six years and nine months, followed by a 16-month break when he worked as head of remote operations for Pagebet. He resumed his collaboration with William Hill in March 2006 as a business analysis manager and continued to grow his career as head of ecommerce operations, head of product development, and director of product development, culminating with the sportsbook director position between October 2015 and July 2017. After he left William Hill, Weston became Superbet’s managing director for the Gibraltar division, vice president for sportsbook operations at SG Digital (Division of Scientific Games Corporation), sportsbook director for the Gaming Innovation Group, Pragmatic Play’s vice president of sportsbook, and, finally, Sportradar’s head of US betting strategy.</p>
<p>Sitting at the convergence of highly dynamic gaming, fintech and blockchain domains and proving a constant focus on innovation, Yolo Group was originally launched in 2014 as a Business-to-Business platform provider. The brand that launched the pioneer licensed bitcoin casino on the planet managed to establish itself as the leading bitcoin gaming platform soon after. The launch of their standalone sportsbook, Sportsbet.io, came naturally in 2016 right before the European Championships. In September 2021, the Coingaming Group announced its ambitious rebranding as Yolo Group. At the beginning of 2022, the group Yolo Group selected Oddin.gg as its new provider of iFrame solutions that would help it elevate esports betting experiences.</p>
