<p>The iconic two-day flat race will officially be known as The Betfred Derby Festival, starting in 2024</p>
<p>Betfred, the renowned UK-based bookmaker, has extended its partnership with The Jockey Club, further solidifying its support for The Derby Festival, set at Epsom Downs. The renewed collaboration secures Betfred’s involvement with The Jockey Club until at least 2026 and should be welcome news for fans of the sport.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Strengthen Their Collaboration</p>
<p>Betfred and the Jockey Club, the UK’s largest commercial horse racing organization owning 15 of the country’s famous racecourses, first announced their collaboration in April 2023. The deal saw the leading independent bookmaker in the UK become the new sponsor of The Oaks and The Derby at Epsom Downs, setting the stage for future collaboration.</p>
<p>According to the newest sponsorship deal, starting in 2024, the iconic two-day flat race will officially be known as The Betfred Derby Festival as the operator strengthens its commitment to one of the most prestigious events in the racing calendar. Fred Done, Betfred Group chairman, emphasized the company’s eagerness to elevate the festival’s prominence.</p>

<p>The partnership extension secures Betfred’s involvement with The Jockey Club until at least 2026. In addition to the naming rights for the festival, Betfred’s agreement includes bolstering their support for the event by backing an extra race on each day of the Festival. This augmentation brings the total sponsored races across the two days to six, enhancing the racing experience for participants and spectators.</p>
<p>Horseracing Remains at the Core of Betfred’s Business</p>
<p>Betfred, founded in Salford in 1967 by Fred Done, has grown into the largest independent bookmaker in the UK with 1,400 high street shops. Beyond its significant presence in the UK, the company operates globally, expanding into South Africa and the USA. The operator’s willingness to expand into new verticals has also bolstered its considerable momentum.</p>
<p>This newest collaboration extension follows Betfred’s sponsorship involvement in major racing events, including The Oaks and The Derby at Epsom, demonstrating its continuous commitment to supporting British horseracing. Amy Starkey, managing director at Jockey Club Racecourses, also hailed the extended partnership as a significant development, expressing enthusiasm for the future collaboration.</p>

<p>The extension of the partnership between Betfred and The Jockey Club underscores a shared dedication to enhancing the quality and prestige of The Derby Festival, promising an exciting future for racing enthusiasts worldwide. It also further bolsters the operator’s leading position in this vertical, serving as an exciting start to 2024.</p>
