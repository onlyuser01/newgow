<p>Keep reading our professional online slot review for Stardust to get a better understanding of the powerful payouts behind the excellent illustrations chosen by the popular provider.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Step into the Land of Fairies</p>
<p>The game introduces players to a fresh take on fairy-themed slots, with its premium graphics and sparkling animations leading the way to the fairyland. The intricate illustrations and choral music immediately create a mystical atmosphere. The five-reeled slot counts 11 magical fairy woodland symbols, such as fireflies, toadstools, berries, sprites, unicorns, and hollowed willow trees, all inviting players to take part in the mesmerizing action. The backdrop is represented by a turquoise water part of a forest filled with magical elements, dwelled by different types of beautiful fairies in different colors. The action takes place at night, by the lake covered in water lilies and housing different fairies.</p>
<p>The design is, as expected, au pair with RTG’s top-tier premium video slots released over the years, and its implementation is flawless, leaving no room for complaints. We particularly enjoyed the fact that there were no standard royal card symbols on the grid that usually interrupt the smooth action on the spinning reels in most of today’s games. Everything nicely falls into place and complements the theme and the storyline behind it.</p>
<p>Stardust: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the game only focuses on 12 symbols that are perfectly aligned with the theme. The all-ways-pay structure of the slot boasting 243 different ways to win and minimum bets of 40 with coin values set at 0.01 are just a few of the main highlights of the game with medium volatility.</p>
<p>To score a win, players need to come across three to five identical on the reels. The combinations pay only when they are seen in adjacent positions from the utmost left reel to the right. Scatter symbols pay in any random position on the grid.</p>
<p>The studio has selected berries, crystals, hove, and toadstools are the low-paying symbols. They pay out between 3x and 75x the line bet. The medium-paying symbols pay between 5x and 100x and they are represented by the ladybugs and the butterflies. To grab wins of 125x, 250x, and 500x, players need at least three glass balls, unicorns, or golden sprite symbols.</p>
<p>The green fairies represent the wild symbols in the game, replacing all the other symbols except for the scatter symbols. They can turn into blue fairies before awarding payouts to players. The blue fairies are also wilds and they substitute the rest of the symbols as well, granting a 4x win when helping form a win.</p>
<p>The game’s scatter is represented by the willow, a symbol that pays up to 125x the total bet for landing five symbols. The same symbols can also unlock a series of bonus games.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s theme is nicely complemented by a series of exciting visual effects that will mostly be visible once the reels are in motion, along with the cool animations with a soothing effect meant to keep the reels spinning. The game also features a mysterious fairy melody that definitely does a good job of doubling up players’ experiences.</p>
<p>Stardust Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is available to both desktop and mobile users. New players will need to put in a minimum effort to start the action and use the interface. The game features the standard “+” and “–” buttons that allow players to change their bets as they please, with total stakes ranging from 40 to 100. It is also possible to click on the Max Bet tab and set up the reel spinning sessions using the highest amounts possible. Players can also engage in automated gameplay by using the available Autoplay tab and selecting a given number of auto spins. To take a look at the paytable and all the symbols, control the music, and other game options, players must access the Help page using the dedicated “i” and “?” icons.</p>
<p>Stardust: Free Spins and Lucky Feature</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, one exciting feature in the game is represented by the green fairy that is possible to change into a blue fairy prior to getting a win. Each blue fairy replaces for a winning combination, helping players land quadruple payouts.</p>
<p>The free spins feature is triggered when three, four, or five scatter willow symbols are seen popping during the main game. This will automatically bring players eight, 15, or 50 free plays. The green fairies are then seen filling up an entire reel during each bonus round. It is possible to retrigger additional games.</p>
<p>The Lucky feature can be triggered in a random manner at the end of any base game. During the feature, one or all of the reels have the potential of turning into wilds and eventually awarding a respin round. This feature can also be triggered again, making the action even more engaging.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With a maximum payout set at 2,000x the total bet, 243 ways to win, cool bonus features promoted with the help of the wild and scatter symbols including a free spins feature with sticky wild reels and spectacular graphics that make up the fairy-themed slot, Stardust is definitely a playable RTG game we can recommend to fans of the genre.</p>
