<p>Kalamba Games has managed to expand its business operations two-fold during 2020, now supplying 300 casinos worldwide and promising to release 14 new games before the year is out.</p>
<p>Record Year Marks Kalamba Games’ Development Efforts in 2020</p>
<p>Kalamba Games has seen a strong 2020 with the company’s business marking up a 100% growth over the past 12 years, its strongest year on record.</p>
<p>Growth has been spurred by numerous industry-defining solutions and specifically by investing in the company’s bespoke product, the Bullseye remote gaming server.</p>
<p>Bullseye has been instrumental in helping Kalamba expand its footprint globally and boost its presence in established markets.</p>
<p>Presently, Kalamba is supplier for at least 300 online casinos worldwide, and the company is planning on launching no fewer than 14 new games by the end of 2020, making for a busy end-of-year period at Kalamba’s development studio.</p>
<p>Kalamba is banking on unique games that add fresh twists to the iGaming experience rather than sinking their teeth in the holiday spirits.</p>
<p>Some of the company’s most successful releases this year included Sadie Swift: Guns n’ Glyphs, Blazing Bull, Goblins and Gemstones Treasure Hunter, and Sky Hunters to name a few.</p>
<p>Roadmap for 2021 Remains Focused and Full of Innovation</p>
<p>Kalamba has ramped up its production in 2020, but innovation will lead the way in 2021, the company says, with a number of new features and promotional tools already in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Kalamba has secured key partnership alliances with operators such as Wildz Casino and Kindred, and teamed up with CasinoTest24, a Twitch Streamer, for one of its most successful titles to date, Sadie Swift: Guns ‘n Glyphs.</p>
<p>The company has not sat on top of revenue but reinvested in expanding its workforce, which has grown by 40% since the beginning of the year. Commenting on recent developments, Kalamba Games CEO Steve Cutler had this to add:</p>
<p>“We have had a fantastic year with several important milestones and I’m really proud that the team has achieved this against a backdrop of great disruption.” -Kalamba Games CEO Steve Cutler</p>
<p>Next year will be one where the company’s focus will remain on refining existing products and further expansion with brand-new solutions.</p>
