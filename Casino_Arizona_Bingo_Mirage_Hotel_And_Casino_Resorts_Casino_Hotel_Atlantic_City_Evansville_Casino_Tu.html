<p>William Hill and Eldorado continue building their partnership</p>
<p>Online betting and in-play solutions coming to Iowa</p>
<p>Iowa betting launches in August</p>
<p>William Hill and Eldorado expand existing partnership to introduce online and mobile betting solutions in Iowa as early as August.</p>
<p>William Hill to Provide Eldorado with In-Play and Online Betting Services</p>
<p>William Hill US is expanding its clout in the United States by striking up a new partnership with Eldorado Resorts’ Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf and Isle Casino Hotel Waterloo in Iowa. As per the agreement, William Hill will supply the properties with land-based and mobile sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>The brand will leverage its expertise in providing bettors from the state with a state-of-the-art gaming platform and granting them a hassle-free mobile betting process. Customers will be able to access various betting markets and Live Betting options through the dedicated app. William Hill has been eyeing the sports betting sector in the US even before the federal ban known as PASPA was struck in 2018.</p>
<p>William Hill and Eldorado won’t introduce their offer right away. Rather, the platform and partner venues will have to wait until such time that lawmakers in the state have approved and given the go-ahead to license holders. Based on the current timeline, Iowa should welcome its first sports bettors in August.</p>
<p>William Hill Builds on a 25-Year-Partnership in Iowa</p>
<p>Based on the agreement, William Hill and Eldorado will work together to introduce a multitude of highly-sought digital solutions for sports betting options. Eldorado is also equally interested in expanding in the iGaming segment by introducing online casinos in the United States.</p>
<p>The companies are no strangers to each other. In September, 2018, William Hill and Eldorado struck a 25-year partnership.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest deal, William Hill US President of Retail Operations David Grolman had the following to add:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to build on our already extensive relationship with Eldorado Resorts as the sports betting industry continues to gain momentum. As a growth-fuelled company, they have taken monumental steps to become leaders in the gaming industry.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eldorado Resorts’ COO Anthony Carano expressed his satisfaction with the deal, arguing that expanding the recently struck William Hill – Eldorado deal to Iowa was a continuation of both companies’ efforts to bring excellence to customers.</p>

<p>As of today, Eldorado holds a $50 million stake in William Hill and owns 20% of the company’s US subsidiary. William Hill has partnered with Eldorado in a bid to expand across the United States. At the same time, Eldorado has also been investing in its land-based operations.</p>
<p>The companies have shown similar appetites to establish a presence in every state and the UK-based betting agency has agreed to go it together with Eldorado, instead of looking for multiple partners in different states.</p>
<p>As current legal statutes are, each license holder for online betting or gaming should partner with a land-based property in order to operate in the country and individual states.</p>
