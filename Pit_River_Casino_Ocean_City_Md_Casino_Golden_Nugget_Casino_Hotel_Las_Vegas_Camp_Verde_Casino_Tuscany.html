<p>Hi guru</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.I have printed off the transaction records. You'll see the amount of times i withdrew after putting in more documents then should be needed to confirm my identity and I've done alot of kyc. The only places that anger me are the ones that use it as a way of delaying funds hoping you'll use them. Cause let's face it gambling is addictive and if your unlucky it's not something you should do. But really anything that hurts your well-being is the same. But I'm sending the transactions page here. The funds from the 300 withdrawal at the bottom is my first withdrawal. After this withdrawal the funds came back at 100$. Which was wrong and I'll tell you why. They gave 20 spins and I won 1.75$. wagering here and the bonus rules say 45x. So that's 77 and change dollars till i was out of the 100 dollar max win. The first win i got of 60$ was in that total but after I'd played hundreds of dollars around 3 hours of play i cash out 300. Ok i was fine with it becoming 100$. But the next day when i saw it was 100$. I felt kinda ripped off and said screw it and played my winnings.Again i have a lucky day and turn the 100 into a 500 withdrawal. Well 709 and I tried 2 times with a hundred bucks to see if my streak would continue it didn't i withdrew 500. This is where is crap they reduced it again saying it's not out of bonus funds till it's been withdrawn. While they deny the withdrawal. With crap like saying the pdf with my address and name from my bank wasn't good enough. When it says that in their kyc. No where in their rules does it state funds are bonus until withdrawn. Then why is wagering there at all why not say just play to 100 dollars and we will lick out your account for days while we make excuses not to pay . Well I'm starting to rant so that's the facts and transaction record.</p>
