    <h1>Luxor Hotel And Casino Atmore Casino Alabama The M Casino Casino On St Croix Md Live Casino Vavada C</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, project https://kasinoazov.info/. Please consider the following situation.</p>
<p>Paragraph 10 of the Fair Play Code states that players experiencing problems with gambling should be able to exclude themselves from the casino when their hobby gets out of control. Players who exclude themselves must not be allowed to play until the end of the self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>VAVADA casino has the status of an even casino. I ask you to review this status in violation of the fair play code and commonplace decency.</p>
<p>I publish a complaint about the irresponsibility of the administration of the casino Vavada</p>
<p>According to paragraph 1 of the Rules resp. games hosted on the vavada website in the "responsible game" section, the operator must take and maintain appropriate measures to help prevent players from becoming addicted and to allow players who access the Websites to self-exclude</p>
<p>By virtue of paragraph 3 of the Rules games, at the request of the End User, as well as in case the health problems of the End User require, the Operator must ensure that the End User for a limited or unlimited period of time cannot use any services offered on any of the Sites that were registered by the Operator</p>
<p>Paragraph 5 of the Rules of the game it is determined that if self-exclusion measures are applied, the Operator or any of its Affiliates should not contact the End User with any information aimed at obtaining interest from the recipient in relation to the Operator's products and services</p>
<p>From the information available on the vavada website, it is indicated: Vavada Ltd. adheres to the policy of a responsible attitude to the game among its customers, the goal of the responsible game policy of Vavada Ltd. is to minimize the negative impact of gambling, the key objective of this policy is the prompt adoption of appropriate measures aimed at ensuring a responsible attitude to the game among customers, we will do our best to avoid the slightest problems that may arise during gambling.</p>
<p>Thus, the Vavada Casino Operator is fully responsible for complying with the rules of responsible gaming. The casino is required to comply with its own rules, including those related to responsible gaming, as well as the rules of the Curacao license.</p>
<p>Curacao's license rules also oblige the Operator to take and maintain appropriate measures to help prevent players from becoming addicted and allow players to self-exclude.</p>
<p>The list of accents (from earlier to later from the moment of registration):</p>
<p>993 * 882/952 <em><em><em><em> 079 - lost van without the right to rebuild due to gambling addiction; Qu</em>sa15@mail.ru - zabl-van without the right to rebuild due to gambling addiction; ma</em>arpa@gmail.com - forgotten without the right to rebuild due to gambling addiction; mag</em>rpa@hotmail.com - forgotten without the right to rebuild due to gambling addiction; anto</em>sov@hotmail.com - forgotten without the right to rebuild due to gambling addiction; pok*am@yandex.ru - valid at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>email addresses are hidden</li>
</ul>
<p>From the big picture, it becomes clear that I am a compulsive player. More than five self-blocked accounts due to gambling addiction. For each newly created account, there was permission from the operator / administration / personally Max</p>
<p>Thus, the Vavada administration knew that I had problems with the game and the inability to control it, but nonetheless it encouraged my illness every time, allowing me to create new accounts. The casino also allowed you to use welcome bonuses, which ultimately coupled with the game</p>
<p>led to a loss of control over their own behavior and, as a consequence, the state of psychological discomfort, irritation, anxiety</p>
<p>The casino has repeatedly violated its own rules and license rules. This violation is a serious violation.</p>
<p>Please explain the validity of accepting deposits from the above accounts</p>
<p>I consider the response of the administration a mockery. So cynical, irresponsible and formal answer I could not hear</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Dear player, good afternoon! The above points apply exclusively to the end user. In this case, each new account is the "unique" end user, upon handling which the administration takes measures for self-exclusion and blocks access to services.</p>
<p>For all requests, accounts were blocked.</p>
<p>When creating a new account, registration takes place by new email or phone number, which are also unique, and the operator will consider the treatment of this user as a new player.</p>
<p>We recommend that you do not create new email addresses and do not register accounts by phone numbers.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Administration of online casino VAVADA</p>
<p>You are trying to fight your demons, you are visiting specialists to somehow break out of this vicious circle, and the casino is ready to allow you to create accounts and accept deposits. And you wonâ€™t be able to get these thoughts out of your head.</p>
<p>VAVADA casino is the only one from a huge number of projects who does this. A shame!</p>
