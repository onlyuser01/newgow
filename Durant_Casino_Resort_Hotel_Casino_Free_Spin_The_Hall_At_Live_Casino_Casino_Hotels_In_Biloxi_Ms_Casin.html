<p>The WSOP.com Fall Online Championship Series has kicked off on November 8 and runs for 15 days through November 22 and with $1 million in guaranteed prize pools.</p>
<p>WSOP Fall Online Championship Series Overview</p>
<p>The virtual showdown known as WSOP.com Fall Online Championship Series has just kicked in with players from Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey all mustering up their virtual avatars for a share of the $1 million guaranteed poker festival. WSOP’s Fall Online Championship is the platform’s way to adapt to new market realities with brick-and-mortar poker still suffering.</p>
<p>The championship, which features 37 different events with buy-ins from $30 to $1,000, will run from November 8 through November 22, when the crowning Main Event takes place. The Main Event will bring a guaranteed prize pool worth $175,000 with it and grant the winner a WSOP Champion Belt.</p>
<p>Today's Fall Online Championship starts at 5PM PST/8PM EST with the Fall OC #4 – $25,000 NLH [Re-entry] for a $100 buy-in. NV: https://t.co/gkamoSrVua NJ: https://t.co/Vk6Ld2X2R4 pic.twitter.com/IsrpuPs6TD — WSOP.com (@WSOPcom) November 9, 2020</p>
<p>There are several tournaments every day, with the 15-day action bringing all buy-in events and levels of competition. The formats range between knockout tournaments, turbo and deep-stack mini-championships, and more. The bulk of the games are played as No Limit Hold’em, but there are also Pot Limit Omaha events here and there.</p>
<p>Schedule and Noteworthy Events in the Following Days</p>
<p>One of the highlight events takes place on Friday, November 13 with the $12,500 Turbo Deepstack available for just $50. More worthwhile events have been planned in the schedule ahead.</p>
<p>For example, the $12,500 Monster Stack on November 16 is available in exchange for a $50 buy-in, and then followed up by a $10,000 PLO 6-max on November 19 for the same buy-in. If you do not want to pay $525 for the Main Event, you may as well opt for the $20,000 Deepstack Turbo taking place on November 22 with a $100 buy-in.</p>
<p>Players can also participate in the NLH High Roller event on November 17 which offers $85,000 in GTD prize money, but asks for a $1,000 buy-in. Another worthwhile and fairly affordable event is the PLO High Roller which will take place on November 22 and ask for a $500 buy-in for a shot at winning a share of the $30,000.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania will have to miss the WSOP.com Fall Championship Series as the state is yet to launch a WSOP/888poker platform. In fact, the Keystone State recently approved licensing for both, but there has been no formal move on the part of the companies representing the brands.</p>
<p>With WSOP and 888poker arriving in Pennsylvania, these competitive events can expect a much bigger interest and liquidity. Michigan is another state that is currently trying to legalize poker, adding to the player and prize pools of the game, but it might have to wait a little while longer.</p>
