    <h1>Barstool Casino Lucky Creek Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne</h1>

<p>Livespins continues to grow its lobby of partners that are available as part of the company’s innovative and highly-distinctive live streaming product and functionality. In the latest business agreement, the company has teamed up with Comtrade in a bid to boost its reach with established operators and brands, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>Comtrade provides some of the biggest names in the iGaming industry and leverages its cutting-edge software to power operators such as Mansion Group, and the M88 brand. Comtrade will benefit from this new partnership offering partner operators and groups of operators the opportunity to also benefit from the Livespins experience.</p>
<p>Livespins has created a super-charged social network that exists as a separate and dedicated lobby section in casinos. The idea behind Livespins products is that streamers play community-favorite games with an overlay menu allowing players to bet alongside the live-streaming action.</p>
<p>Players are free to pick their own bet size, and there is no pressure to match the pace on the screen. Livespins provides games from dozens of established tier-one suppliers, including iSoftBet, Relax Gaming, Yggdrasil Gaming, SlotMatrix and others. Comtrade’s operators will now have access to this stardom of products that will come wrapped in Livespins’ delightfully-innovative gameplay mode.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity to expand the platform’s reach, Livespins CCO Michael Pedersen said that he was very happy to see Comtrade become the latest in a string of operators. He hailed the company for its established track record in powering some of the biggest brands in the world, and added:</p>
<p>"That Livespins sits within the lobbies of these casinos means that players are afforded the same responsible gambling measures as when playing other games and this in turn means that Comtrade’s partners can leverage the streaming opportunity confident that they are fully compliant."</p>
<p>Comtrade CCO Steven Valentine was similarly excited about the opportunity to further strengthen the type of product that operators receive in the end. Livespins will significantly improve the experience for partners’ audiences and players.</p>
<p>Valentine said that slot streaming is only going to get bigger, and having an important partner such as Livespins on one’s side is the best way to ensure business resilience and sustainability. Besides, Valentine added that Livespins is a company that clearly delivers this innovative product in a responsible and compliant way that paves the way for the future of iGaming.</p>
