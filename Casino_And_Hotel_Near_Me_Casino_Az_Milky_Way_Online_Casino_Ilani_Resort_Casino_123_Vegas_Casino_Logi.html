<p>This summer, the Las Vegas Strip will be ablaze with residencies and tours featuring some of the biggest female artists in the music industry</p>
<p>Two musical legends, Madonna and Adele, are extending their Las Vegas residencies into 2024, while pop star Kelly Clarkson has announced her own residency on The Strip starting in July 2023.</p>
<p>The Queens of Pop Return to Las Vegas: Adele’s Residency and Madonna’s Expanded Tour</p>
<p>Madonna is expanding her global Celebration Tour with eight new dates, including a third show in Las Vegas on January 18, 2024, at the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino Las Vegas, in addition to the previously announced two shows at the beginning of October 2023.</p>
<p>Madonna’s loyal fans and members of MGM Rewards and AXS customers will receive access to a pre-sale running from March 30, with the general on-sale starting on March 31. VIP passes will also be available for purchase, offering fans premium tickets, backstage photo ops, behind-the-scenes tours, and limited-edition lithographs. Madonna’s special guest for all tour dates will be Bob the Drag Queen.</p>
<p>Madonna, the top-selling female solo touring artist ever, has announced that The Celebration Tour has already sold out more than 40 shows and is still going strong in Toronto, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Las Vegas and other locations. Starting on July 15, 2023, in Vancouver, BC, The Celebration Tour will visit various destinations in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Adele had to delay her Las Vegas residency due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused some backlash from fans. However, she will return for a few weeks in June, followed by a summer tour from August to fall. Adele has added 34 dates to her Weekends With Adele’s residency at the Colosseum Theatre in Caesars Palace. Fans can expect to hear her new album and her classic hits. Adele took to social media to express her excitement about continuing the tour and thanked fans for their support.</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson Announces 10-Day Las Vegas Residency</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson has announced a 10-day residency in Las Vegas called “Chemistry: An Intimate Evening with Kelly Clarkson” in support of her upcoming album of the same name. The residency will take place from July 28 to August 19, 2023, at the Bakkt Theater at Planet Hollywood.</p>
<p>Clarkson has revealed that her album will showcase all aspects of love, describing it as “the arc of an entire relationship.” She chose the title “Chemistry” because it can be both a positive and negative force in relationships.</p>
<p>Clarkson’s Las Vegas residency will feature large-scale productions and will be a departure from her usual appearances on “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” She has assured fans that she will not add more shows beyond the 10-day schedule, stating that she also needs to take a break. Tickets for the residency will go on sale starting March 31.</p>
