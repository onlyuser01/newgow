    <h1>Guymon Casino Murphy Nc Casino Hardrock Casino Florida Tucson Az Casinos Traverse City Casino Desert</h1>

<p>Thank you very much, Alex, for your reply. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what found https://1win.pro/rules.html#20:</p>
<p>"9.4. Due to the legal reasons we do not accept any Clients from the following countries:</p>
<p>9.4.1. Absolute Restriction. No customers will be accepted from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, France and Italy."</p>
<p>Since there is a possibility to register an account from a restricted country (see the screenshot below) and deposit funds, I would like you to confirm that you’ve submitted correct data and haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account.</p>
<p>Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
