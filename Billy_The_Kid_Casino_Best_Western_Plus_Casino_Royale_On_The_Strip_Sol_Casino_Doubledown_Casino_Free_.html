    <h1>Billy The Kid Casino Best Western Plus Casino Royale On The Strip Sol Casino Doubledown Casino Free</h1>

<p>Hi CasinoGURU, I have been playing on 22bet for a very long time now and have gambled 10's of thousands a month since I joined.</p>
<p>A few months ago I got blocked for documents request, I sent everything and my account was activated again.</p>
<p>Now I got up to 5000â‚¬ in the balance and my account was once again blocked for documentation requests.</p>
<p>The operator behund their security e-mail is asking for repeated documentation, does not answer to any questions and threatens me to block my email if I keep asking when this endless verification process will finally be over.</p>
<p>I have sent them everything they could ask for. There have been around 100 emails back and forth of me sending everything they ask.</p>
<p>Neteller screenshots? Sent that</p>
<p>Printscreens of cards used for deposits? Sent that</p>
<p>Id? Sent that</p>
<p>Utillities bills? Sent that</p>
<p>Bank statements? Sent that</p>
<p>Also had to print 60 sheets of documents to sign to confirm that I had been aware of all the deposits made in the last few months. (Wasted 3-4 hours just signing and filling everything.</p>
<p>I have done all this and the operator just keeps not responding to anything and I don't have the guarantee that this process will be over at any time.</p>
<p>Obviosly they just do it when I win big, but I believe that this could just be a bad opearator and if this gets resolved I could give the casino a second chance.</p>
<p>I just ask for my account to get back to normal because this is just not acceptable and a casino as big as 22bet should pay their customers without all this trouble.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
