<p>The leading global online casino and sports betting operator, Betsson, expanded its roster of partners last week. The company revealed Friday it joined forces with the ex-football player and current sports commentator, Nicole Regnier. Under the terms of the new collaboration, Regnier was named Betsson's new ambassador in Columbia.</p>
<p>Last year, Regnier retired from professional football but unveiled her plans to keep her engagement with sports. Her retirement coincided with her new career as a sports commentator.</p>
<p>Regnier worked as an analyst for Win Sports for the Colombian Women's league. What's more, earlier this year, she became a part of ESPN. Overall, she was a part of different programs focused on sports analysis while at the same time playing an important role in strengthening the presence of women in sports.</p>
<p>Before her career as a commentator and analyst, Regnier played football professionally for a decade. She was a part of international and national teams such as Rayo Vallecano, Atlético Madrid and América de Cali, among others. Additionally, Regnier was among the women who participated in the first Women's League in Colombia.</p>
<p>In a statement released on November 25, 2022, Regnier said: "I am very happy and full of expectations for what we are going to build in the future with Betsson, as it is a company with which I have a lot in common." She added: "First of all, there is the passion for soccer; but we also share interests regarding the creation of more spaces for women in sports and, in general, regarding the strengthening of sports activities in the country."</p>
<p>Betsson's latest collaboration with Regnier complements the company's commitment to offering exciting experiences for sports fans. What's more, the collaboration strengthens the betting industry in the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, Betsson benefits from increased brand exposure within Latin America, which is a strategic market that holds significant potential. The company explained: "Through this alliance, Betsson Colombia reaffirms its commitment to work together with sports experts to continue innovating in the betting industry characterized by an exciting offer with a high level of responsibility."</p>
<p>Santiago Melo, Betsson Colombia's Country Manager, added that the company is delighted to join forces with Regnier. He explained that Regnier was among the first players from Colombia to compete in European football.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Melo added: "I am certain that together with Nicole and our regional ambassador, Mario Alberto Yepes, we will advance in our purpose of being a company recognized for its sports experience and an exciting portfolio of services."</p>
