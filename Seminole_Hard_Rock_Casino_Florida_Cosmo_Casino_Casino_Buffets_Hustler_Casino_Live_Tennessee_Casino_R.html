<p>Ragna Wolves review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ragna Wolves is themed around a Norse fantasy world.</p>
<p>As players explore a mysterious realm, they will encounter a pack of wolves with special powers. With the help of the gods, players might learn the secrets of these enchanting creatures.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in Norse mythology may be especially pleased to discover this slot.</p>
<p>Win in the Ragna Wolves slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation of Ragna Wolves has a trippy aesthetic with contrasting shades of deep purple and orange featured prominently. A stylized dragon exhales flames on one side of the reels, and a starry sky swirls with mist on the other.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will see ornate runes, magical trees, and Norse gods. The gods seem to be riding chariots as their capes float around them, one representing the flames of the sun, and the other the pale light of the moon.</p>
<p>The stars of the reels are the Ragna Wolves themselves, a blue one posing against a moonlit sky, and a red one standing fiercely in the presence of an eclipse.</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a sorrowful tone that would suit a dramatic fantasy film. The music loop is quite short, so some players might find themselves reaching for the mute button.</p>
<p>Huge win during the Free Spins bonus round</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Ragna Wolvesis a five-reel, three-row slot with wins awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels.</p>
<p>Players can opt to increase their bet by 10x in order to guarantee that a Wild symbol will appear in every spin in the base game.</p>
<p>If players wish to buy directly into the Free Spins feature, they can pay 100x their total bet. This will award 10 free spins.</p>
<p>For 500x the player’s total bet, 13 free spins are awarded, along with a Multiplier Wild that will not reset between each free spin.</p>

<p>The Countdown Wild symbol appears on reels 2 and 4, and has an associated value that indicates the number of respins that will be awarded if the Countdown Wild is part of a win.</p>
<p>The Multiplier Wild only appears on the middle reel and continues to award respins as long as there is a win. The Multiplier Wild features an associated multiplier that increases for each consecutive win. When players receive a losing spin, the multiplier resets.</p>

<p>The Free Spins feature begins when players land 3 Free Spin symbols, starting with 10 free spins. A greater number of Wilds naturally land during the Free Spins feature and function as they do during the base game.</p>
