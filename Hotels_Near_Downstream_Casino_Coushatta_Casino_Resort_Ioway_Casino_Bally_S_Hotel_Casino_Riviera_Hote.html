<p>The latest collaboration strengthens Bragg's position in the country, reaffirming its role as a go-to supplier of content and technology for iGaming operators</p>
<p>The leading provider of iGaming solutions, content and technology, powering online and land-based gambling operators, Bragg Gaming Group, announced a new partnership focused on the gambling sector in Brazil. On Thursday, the company revealed it joined forces with Superbet, agreeing to deliver its aggregation platform for the operator.</p>
<p>Besides going live with its aggregation platform, Bragg agreed to deliver third-party content for Superbet. In addition, the iGaming content and solutions supplier agreed to deliver titles from its proprietary portfolio, including games from its in-house studios, Indigo Magic and Atomic Slot Lab.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new collaboration is expected to solidify Bragg’s presence in Brazil, a market that is estimated to hold significant potential. The announced deal comes ahead of the country’s much-anticipated gambling reform that may result in the regulation of online gambling, as well as online sports betting.</p>
<p>If lawmakers in the country continue their efforts, Brazil may become a major iGaming and betting market as early as 2024. Despite the efforts so far, earlier this month, Brazil’s Senate greenlighted sports betting but turned down online gambling after a majority of 37 members voted against iGaming and only 27 votes were in favor of the activity.</p>
<p>The Deal Brings Excitement to the Two Companies</p>
<p>Adam Shaw, Superbet’s chief revenue officer, spoke about the potential of the gambling sector in Brazil. He explained that once the market opens for licensed operators, the company anticipates offering supreme online gambling experiences. Finally, Shaw said: “Bragg’s aggregation platform supplies us with a diverse portfolio of proprietary and exclusive content as well as games from the industry’s most popular providers and we are thrilled to partner with them in Brazil.”</p>
<p>“We have already seen tremendous growth with Superbet through aggregation partnerships in several countries, and this Brazilian launch is another important milestone which throws a spotlight on Bragg’s position as a leading supplier in this fast-growing iGaming market.“ Matej Nemec, commercial director at Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Matej Nemec, Bragg’s commercial director, revealed that the new collaboration with Superbet builds upon a successful business relationship between the two companies from several other markets. Moreover, he explained that the latest launch in Brazil strengthened Bragg’s position in the country and reaffirmed its role as a go-to supplier for the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Nemec pointed out: “We offer a wide portfolio of casino content that has already proven popular with local audiences in LatAm, and this partnership will further our ambitious growth plans for the region which will be a key focus for us in 2024.”</p>
<p>Previously, Bragg and Superbet collaborated for different markets across Europe. At the time, Bragg agreed to power the gaming operator’s brands in Belgium, as well as Serbia.</p>
