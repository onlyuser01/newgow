    <h1>Plusz Online Casino Watch Casino Royale Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Gila River Resorts Casino</h1>

<p>One of the leading providers of sportsbook solutions and technologies, Altenar, has signed a new partnership with Belgian operator Starcasino</p>
<p>The new partnership is in fact an ongoing collaboration as Altenar first completed its product integration late last year and is now moving forward with making the sportsbook platform fully available at Starcasino, and to its players.</p>
<p>Belgium Just a First Market for This Collaboration</p>
<p>As a result, Starcasino gains access to a highly-competitive product that is associated with strong engagement and customer retention, that will deliver pre-match and live betting offerings. Altenar’s products come with full front and backend support.</p>
<p>This means that Starcasino will also have access to the full promotional suite and market-leading customer support management options. Altenar offers 24/7 support to partner brands to help the navigate the platform and deliver on the best possible experience for their players. The partnership follows on similar expansions with ChillyBets in Germany and PalmBets in the Balkans and Bulgaria in particular.</p>
<p>As to the latest tie-up, Altenar is also Starcasino’s technology partner, which means that it will deliver a 360-degree solution that will make it possible for the brand to enjoy the best-in-class tech provision for its existing and future markets.</p>
<p>While the partnership is only now being put to a solid test in market conditions, Starcasino is very confident about the future of this collaboration. Commenting on the opportunity, Starcasino representative Stefaan Maene said:</p>
<p>When setting out our plan for launch in Belgium, we hoped to have a partner that not only allows us to offer the best possible sports betting experience to players, but works with us to help us both grow. Starcasino representative Stefaan Maene</p>
<p>He hailed Altenar as the right partner for the company and confirmed that the company is looking to further expand its reach in various markets, including Belgium at first, but later on – in other worthwhile jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Altenar sales manager, Alejandro Cazorla, was equally chuffed with this development. The sportsbook solution, he said, was one of the best and most flexible options available, and the entire team at Altenar was happy to welcome Starcasino as its latest partner.</p>
<p>“We have certainly found that in Altenar, and we look forward to enjoying a great deal of success in this exciting market,” Cazorla concluded.</p>
