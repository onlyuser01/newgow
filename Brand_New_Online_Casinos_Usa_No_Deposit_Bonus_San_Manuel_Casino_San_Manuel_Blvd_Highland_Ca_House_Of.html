<p>The termination includes the cessation of promotions such as campus ads and digital marketing</p>
<p>The partnership between the University of Maryland and PointsBet Sportsbook has officially come to an end, marking the second time PointsBet has terminated a college sports team deal.</p>
<p>PointsBet Cuts Ties with University of Maryland, Reflecting Evolving College Betting Regulations</p>
<p>The University of Maryland partnership, which began in 2020 and had three years remaining, follows the March conclusion of the deal between PointsBet and the University of Colorado, eliminating Folsom Field advertising and sportsbook messaging through the school’s channels. PointsBet’s decision to end these partnerships coincided with its joining the Responsible Gaming Council, alongside other sports betting operators like Fanatics Sportsbook and Hard Rock Sportsbook.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the partnership between PointsBet and the University of Maryland is also influenced by potential legislation in Maryland that could reshape the state’s college betting landscape. Lawmakers have passed a bill that, if signed by Governor Wes Moore, would require all sports wagering deals with Maryland universities to be made public and prohibit compensation for new user signups.</p>
<p>The termination of the partnership with the University of Maryland comes at a time when college sports betting faces scrutiny and controversy. The Ohio Casino Control Commission recently placed a hold on wagers in the state for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team due to suspicious betting activity. Furthermore, both Iowa State University and Iowa University have initiated investigations into student-athlete betting.</p>
<p>College Sports Betting Partnerships Under Scrutiny</p>
<p>Maryland itself only recently launched mobile sports betting in November 2022, making the end of the University of Maryland’s partnership a significant development. While Maryland sports betting law allows wagering on in-state college teams like the Terrapins, Mount St. Mary’s University Mountaineers, and John Hopkins University Blue Jays, other states have more specific rules regarding betting on local college teams.</p>
<p>PointsBet’s decision to exit its partnership with the University of Maryland reflects the increasing challenges faced by sports betting operators in the college sports arena. With heightened regulatory environments and concerns about gambling’s impact on young people, college sports betting partnerships are being scrutinized across the country.</p>
<p>Senator Richard Blumenthal has called for the termination of all college sports betting partnerships, prompting the American Gaming Association to revise its sports betting marketing code to limit such partnerships.</p>
<p>While some college partnerships, like the one between Caesars and Michigan State Spartans, are facing backlash and potential termination, others continue. However, the ever-changing landscape of college sports betting and the increasing focus on responsible gambling practices may continue to reshape these partnerships in the future.</p>
