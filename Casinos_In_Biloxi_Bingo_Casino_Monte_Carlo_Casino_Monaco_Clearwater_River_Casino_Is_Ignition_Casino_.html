<p>PayNearMe, a modern and reliable billing and payments platform, has received approval to offer its solutions to operators in the state.</p>
<p>PayNearMe Goes Live in Kansas</p>
<p>The Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission allowed the provider to supply operators with its acclaimed MoneyLine payment solution. This will allow gambling operators and B2B companies to use MoneyLine as soon as sports betting launches in the state.</p>
<p>Kansas legalized sports betting on September 1, allowing a number of operators to take bets from sports enthusiasts. The state will also launch online sports betting a week later. Kansas, furthermore, marks the 20th state where PayNearMe’s solutions are available.</p>
<p>With sports betting now live, customers in the Sunflower State can now wager with some of the best operators in North America. This notably includes companies such as Butler National, Catena Media and DraftKings, among others. The approval of PayNearMe’s MoneyLine solutions will allow companies to have a higher degree of flexibility when it comes to payments</p>
<p>A Timely Approval</p>
<p>Michael Kaplan, chief revenue officer and general manager of PayNearMe, noted that the next few days will be busy because of the launch of sports betting and the upcoming National Football League season. This means that there will be high traffic of money as many fans will be placing bets on their favorite teams. Considering this, Kaplan said that he is delighted to launch PayNearMe in the state and support the local operators from day one of Kansas sports betting.</p>
<p>Enabling our clients to go live on the same day Kansas residents can place online wagers ensures they will be able to seamlessly manage the millions of dollars projected to be wagered online in Kansas over the next year. Michael kaplan, chief revenue officer, PayNearMe</p>
<p>Kaplan mentioned that his team has been working hard to make sure its solutions are well-suited to help operators process the huge sports betting handle.</p>
<p>Connor McNulty, PayNearMe’s COO and vice president of legal, also shared his thoughts on the matter. He noted that PayNearMe is very experienced with payments within the gambling industry and has worked closely with the Kansas regulator to ensure its solutions are compliant with the statutory requirements. He added that fast approval times are a top priority for the company as more states launch their own sports betting and online gaming markets.</p>
<p>One of the latest operators to pick PayNearMe’s MoneyLine as its preferred payment solution is SaharaBets, which inked an Arizona-facing agreement with the provider.</p>
