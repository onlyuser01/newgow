    <h1>Grand Casino Bakery Twin Pines Casino Northern Quest Resort And Casino Circus Circus Hotel And Casin</h1>

<p>Good Evening</p>
<p>Since 12/18 while I have won some money I have a problem with the verification and withdrawal of my winnings. It had happened again in the past for a smaller amount of course. The first time was for the amount of €700 which since they canceled my withdrawals I continued to play and while the money was reduced I made a withdrawal of €350 which was immediately accepted and a withdrawal of €150 which was rejected. This happened on September 19, 2022. The same happened on December 16 after 3 months of abstinence and I started playing again. The money that entered my account was €300 while I had won more but after my withdrawals were canceled I continued to play and the amount decreased. And now we come to today's issue. I have earned the amount I have entered and they are asking me for account verification information. The information I was initially asked for was:</p>
<p>1) Photo ID</p>
<p>2) Photo of my card</p>
<p>3) Photo (selfie) of me holding my ID and card with the live chat in the background.</p>
<p>I send them and they tell me the identification process will take 5 working days.</p>
<p>There were two other cards in my account, one which belonged to me and one which belonged to a third party and was used ONLY and ONLY for a withdrawal which was of the order of €20. In other words, we have a total of three cards, two of mine and one of a third party.</p>
<p>I was asked for the statements in pdf format to confirm that deposits have been made from these cards as well and I sent them. These happened on December 18th.</p>
<p>So on December 20th they asked me who these two cards belong to and I told them the names of the owners. Later that day they asked me for a photo (selfie) of the cardholder which was not in my name. I asked them if there is a problem that is not in my name and they said they don't have that information.</p>
<p>So on December 21st I send them the photos with the ID of the owner as well as the selfie of him holding it.</p>
<p>Later on December 21st they asked me for a photo (selfie) of the cardholder which was not mine and on December 22nd I sent them that too.</p>
<p>In total, from December 18 to 22, I have sent the following:</p>
<p>1) Photo ID front and back</p>
<p>2) Photo of both my cards</p>
<p>3) Selfie photo of me holding my ID and card against live chat background as requested</p>
<p>4) Selfie photo of me with my second card</p>
<p>5) Front and back photo ID of the cardholder that is not in my name</p>
<p>6) Selfie photo of the owner with his ID</p>
<p>7) Photo of the holder's card that is not in my name</p>
<p>8) Selfie photo of the card holder which is not mine with his card together</p>
<p>9) All statements from all cards</p>
<p>My issue is that every day they ask me for something new and I suspect that this is to delay the verification of my account. It has already been a week since the day I sent them the first message and since December 22 when I sent them the last photos there has been no update.</p>
