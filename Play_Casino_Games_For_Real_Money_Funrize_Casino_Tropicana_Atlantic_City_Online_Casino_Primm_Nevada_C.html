<p>Been a long time player on bc</p>
<p>lost a lot and won a lot.</p>
<p>Today i played twist game first time with big amounts i had tried it earlier a few bets.</p>
<p>I lost a little over 89000$ in 6 bets on it, all were 0 multipliers, I have had lost 15 bets in a row at 2x too in dice and other games on bc and other sites but this twist game 6 looses just with a new seed seemed a little suspicious to me.</p>
<p>I wanted to verify the results as the game is "Provably Fair"</p>
<p>I thought it wont be an issue and site is legit but still had some doubt and wanted to verify.</p>
<p>Now strangely after searching a lot, I am unable to find any documentation for how to verify the bets.</p>
<p>On the bet slip when Verify is clicked it takes to a page which throws a 404 error as seen - https://prnt.sc/f4y7mx5IdagC</p>
<p>Ok no issue might be some error.</p>
<p>Then i clicked the provably fair tab on bc and clicked on twist game, there the description it shows is no where related to twist game, you guys can read it here https://bc.game/help/provably-fair by clicking on twist game or see the screenshot https://prnt.sc/5yKZZdUMUpwA .</p>
<p>And on the twist game if validate is clicked it takes to verification page of classic dice - https://prnt.sc/WMi9XC23376s</p>
<p>Ok no issue might be some error,</p>
<p>I have a vip host on bc since over an year, I sent him the screenshots and asked him to get me an email id so I can raise it to proper person, because normal chat and email are mostly unhelpful, chat told me to clear cache check mirrors, change browser I did all that</p>
<p>They then said try again later lol.</p>
<p>Now the VIP Host first told me - "Asking around! Getting back to you once i got the correct info"</p>
<p>After 4 hours I texted him for an update</p>
<p>And 2 hours after that he got back to me - "Nop sorry it's compplicated i heard"</p>
<p>This is what raised the alarm bells for me, is the game really provably fair or I got scammed of 89,000$?</p>
<p>I have documented and captured screenshots for all I have said, someone from BC please help here, if the game is really provably fair please share documentation and prove the results of my bets!</p>
