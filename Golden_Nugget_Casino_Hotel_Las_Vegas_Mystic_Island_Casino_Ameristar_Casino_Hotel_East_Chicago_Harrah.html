<p>The launch of the new soccer fantasy game called Fantasy5 coincides with the start of the new Premier League season</p>
<p>20SHOTS, the fast-growing business-to-business betting software supplier, announced it forged a new deal, allowing it to expand the reach of its famous soccer jackpot game. On Thursday, the company revealed it joined forces with Grosvenor Casinos, allowing the leading casino and sports betting operator to gain access to its flagship free-to-play soccer jackpot game called Fantasy5.</p>
<p>The popular jackpot game allows users to pick five players to “beat their fantasy points target in five weekly games.” The customers that guess correctly all five picks will benefit from a £10,000 ($12,800) jackpot from Grosvenor Casinos. If more than one player makes the correct guesses, the jackpot is shared between them. Under the terms of the new agreement, Grosvenor Casinos will deliver the soccer game with its own branding. Additionally, the free-to-play soccer jackpot game will have a separate player pool from 20SHOTS.</p>
<p>The launch of the new soccer jackpot game is planned for Friday, August 11, 2023, via GrosvenorCasinos.com. The introduction of the thrilling new game comes just in time for the start of the new season of the Premier League and is expected to engage with new audiences and existing fans of the sport.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Grosvenor Casinos confirmed the launch of its Live Casino Studio. Back in February, the leading betting and gaming company expanded its offering by bringing in live casino options for its growing customer base.</p>
<p>20SHOTS Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Jacob Kalms, 20SHOTS’ co-founder and CEO, was delighted about the new collaboration with Grosvenor Casinos. He acknowledged that the deal represents a major milestone for the company and reminded that 20SHOTS has a partnership with BoyleSports for the Fantasy5 game too, offering thrilling experiences for customers in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Kalms said that 20SHOTS is excited to expand Grosvenor’s offering and position within the market. “We expect that its decision to offer a £10,000 jackpot will make it especially appealing to players and we look forward to a successful season,” said 20SHOTS’ co-founder and CEO in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We now have multiple partners across multiple jurisdictions and we have a number of further partnerships due to be announced imminently.“ Jacob Kalms, co-founder and CEO at 20SHOTS</p>
<p>Tom Orton, Rank Group’s director of sports, the parent company of Grosvenor Casinos, added that the collaboration brings excitement. He said: “We were really impressed by the company’s retention and engagement figures and believe it is going to be a very successful acquisition and retention tool for our brand.” Finally, Orton said that the launch of Fantasy5 complements the company’s vision for the Premier League and anticipated growth.</p>
