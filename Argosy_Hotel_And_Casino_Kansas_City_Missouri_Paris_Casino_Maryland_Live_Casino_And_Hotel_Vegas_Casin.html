    <h1>Argosy Hotel And Casino Kansas City Missouri Paris Casino Maryland Live Casino And Hotel Vegas Casin</h1>

<p>I had won a grand jackpot on storm lords, prior to this I had a cashback coupon claimed for roughly $65, this had a playthrough requirement, and max bet limit. The casinos playthrough balance had not been completely finished, unaware of this, I innocently upped my bet to $12.50 (max bet on playthrough balance is $10) I had only done 7x $12.50 bets before the playthrough was completed and alll funds become withdrawalable.</p>
<p>All of this information only become aware to me recently. Had continued playing for quiet a long period of time on the same machine 'storm lords' I got the coin bonus and hd all 15 coins exposed and won the $50,000 jackpot.</p>
<p>I was put through 3+ weeks of slow account verification and not once had anybody mentioned of any rules broken.until it was verified then I made the claim of withdrawal and denied for 7x bets $2.50 over the maximum bet.</p>
<p>I have deposited thousands upon thousands to this casino, without one withdrawal. The casino offered me $550 to 'build a good reputation'. For the casino.</p>
<p>I had made aware to the casino of my personal situation that had recently deteriorated rapidly. Not to go into to much detail, but a sibling passed away, with nobody to pay for a funeral but myself. I lost my job days after that, I have a young family of my own at the age of 27 with 2 kids under 3 and a partner who cannot work and now have no income to keep a roof over their heads or bury my sister.</p>
<p>The win on the casino seemed like a diamond in the rough and allowed some relief for the short term while I get another income in order. But the casino chose to make my only chance at my family being fed and warm with my sister farewelled impossible. Over 7x bets wagered $2.50 over themax bet, unknowingly breaking the rules. So close to the playthrough I don't understand how their cannot be a closer assessment and even a reduced payout agreement, not $550. Down from $55,000.</p>
<p>If I had made a clear intentional attempt of say 50 totalled bets over the playthrough even 30 bets I could understand their logic, but 7 bets !? When my win was $55,000. Its pure greed and minimal care for the player and no attempt to come to an agreement.</p>
