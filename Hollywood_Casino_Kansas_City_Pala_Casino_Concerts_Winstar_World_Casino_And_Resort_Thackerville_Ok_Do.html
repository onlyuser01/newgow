<p>Dear Maureen,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services and this is what I found in Responsible Gaming section https://casino765.com/:</p>
<p>"Casino765's Self Exclusion Restrictions</p>
<p>As part of the Casino765 policy, we give you the option to take a break and suspend your use of your Casino765 account for the below time periods:</p>
<p>A one-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A seven-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A fourteen-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A fourteen-day self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A one-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A two-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A three-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A four-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A six-month self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A one-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A three-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>A five-year self-exclusion period.</p>
<p>You can request a self-exclusion period by simply sending an email to our customer service department</p>
<p>During your self-exclusion time period Casino765 will block your account for the entire Casino765 platform and any new account that you might attempt to open on the Casino765 platform will also be blocked.</p>
<p>During a self-exclusion period your account will be blocked and this will be irrevocable until the self-exclusion period is over. Once your self-exclusion period has come to an end a one day cooling off period will apply before your account is reopened.</p>
<p>Please note that a request for a self-exclusion period may take up to 72 hours to be processed."</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend sending an email to support@casino765.com, in this way you’ll have a proof of such an action. Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
