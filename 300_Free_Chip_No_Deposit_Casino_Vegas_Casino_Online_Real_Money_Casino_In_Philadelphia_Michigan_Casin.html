<p>Google Play has posted information about a pilot program for DFS and Rummy apps that will now be launched in a temporary capacity in India. Essentially, the company is allowing Indian developers to make their products accessible to local customers with DFS betting and rummy apps getting a temporary exemption.</p>
<p>Google Play India to Feature Rummy and DFS Programs</p>
<p>Google provided a brief overview of what the pilot is about. Daily fantasy sports is a form of betting activity whereby contestants leverage their knowledge and understanding of athletic events and make decisions based on “skill” rather than “luck-based” factors. Contestants are supposed to follow and track the daily performance of human athletes across various sports and teams and then compose the best possible selections to win.</p>
<p>These fantasy rosters are then compared to those of other participants, and the best team wins. The “skill-based element” comes from players actually following performances and trying to compose the best teams.</p>
<p>The Rummy apps are games in which players strategize and try to memorize the fall of cards, Google’s pilot program page explains. The games are played with 27 cards and follow pre-approved rules and format allowed under current Google Play policies. The pilot program will be running for an extensive period of one year, from September 28, 2022, through September 28, 2023, and be available to the Indian version of the shop.</p>
<p>All developers must complete an application form which will be reviewed by Google’s team before any entity is approved to list its products in these two categories on Google Play India. Google has been treading carefully when it comes to launching mobile apps that support sports betting products.</p>
<p>Embracing Indian Market’s Potential</p>
<p>Over the past years, the company has kept mostly silent on the matter, issuing updates when it felt the need to. In the United States, it cleared all regulated states that offer various forms of gambling and enabled developers serving those states to launch mobile apps. Elsewhere, Google has mostly clamped down on betting and gambling apps. Allowing “skill-based” app betting, though, could be a good way to ensure that consumers are protected.</p>
<p>The pilot program will be a litmus test if such apps can be launched in other markets in the future. India is one of the most populous countries with a clear interest in sports betting, but the activity is not legalized and most Indian consumers turn to offshore and often fraudulent gambling websites.</p>
