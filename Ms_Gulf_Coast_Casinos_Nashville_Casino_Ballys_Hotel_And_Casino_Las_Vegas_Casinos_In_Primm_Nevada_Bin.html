<p>Last month marked a busy period for licensed sports betting operators in the state who reported a year-over year increase in betting handle and gross gaming revenue</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in New York, the New York State Gaming Commission, has announced its latest report, outlining the performance of mobile sports betting operators in April this year.</p>
<p>Judging by the latest figures, sportsbooks enjoyed a busy month with mobile betting handle hitting $1.54 billion, marking an increase when compared to the corresponding period last year. There was a notable increase of more than $100 million in the betting handle when the latest result is compared to the $1.39 billion result from April 2022.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the uptick in betting handle also led to an increase in mobile betting GGR last month. In April 2022, mobile betting GGR hit $104.1 million. This year, in April, the GGR result soared by more than $34 million, hitting $138.8 million.</p>
<p>Per the tax rate for online sportsbooks in New York which is 51%, a breakdown of the $138.8 million in GGR reveals that the net revenue for platform providers was $68 million, while the revenue to education for April hit $70.8 million.</p>
<p>While the result from April marked an increase on a year-over-year basis, this wasnâ€™t the case on a month-over-month comparison. In March this year, the betting handle hit $1.79 billion marking a new record for the mobile betting vertical in the state. Similarly, mobile betting GGR in March hit $162.8 million, which was significantly higher than the April result.</p>
<p>FanDuel, DraftKings and Caesars Are the Top 3 Sportsbooks for April</p>
<p>Based on the results released by the New York State Gaming Commission, FanDuel was an unquestionable leader within the mobile betting market in the state last month. The company saw a betting handle of $626.3 million, resulting in a GGR of nearly $71 million. This GGR translated to $34.8 million in proceeds for FanDuel and $36.2 million in proceeds for education for April.</p>
<p>Second in line last month was DraftKings. Overall, the betting handle reported by the sportsbook last month was $516,406,585. This resulted in some $44.9 million in mobile betting GGR. A breakdown of the GGR reveals that some $22.9 million was allocated toward education last month while DraftKings saw $22 million in net revenue.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook was the operator with the third-highest betting handle in April. The company saw $185.3 million in betting handle last month, translating to some $12,752,332 million in GGR. Of that total, Caesars collected $6.2 million in net revenue, while some $6.5 was allocated to education.</p>
