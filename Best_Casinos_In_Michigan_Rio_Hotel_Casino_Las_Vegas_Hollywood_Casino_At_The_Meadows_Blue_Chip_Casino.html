<p>The premier online gaming company in North America, FanDuel, announced the launch of a new advertising campaign. On Monday, the company which is also an official sports betting partner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), confirmed it launched "Think Like a Player," a new ad campaign that comes just in time for the NBA playoffs.</p>
<p>FanDuel explained that the new campaign will bring one legendary NBA player from his prime playing days by leveraging deepfake technology. Collaborating with the basketball legend and NBA Analyst, Charles Barkley, the company's "Think Like a Player" campaign will introduce a young version of the player that is deepfake-generated.</p>
<p>Barkley's 1990s version will be called "Young Chuck," and the deep-fake generated player will encourage "FanDuel users to think like a player when placing wagers on the platform, recruiting his younger self to help fans understand how they can create exciting Same Game Parlays on their favorite players," a statement released by the leading sportsbook reveals.</p>
<p>Andrew Sneyd, FanDuel's EVP of Marketing, said about the latest ad campaign: "We're excited to tap into the energy of the NBA playoffs as well as the fanhood for Charles." Finally, he explained: "This campaign will not only cement FanDuel's place in the conversation of brands that are adding to the sports experience but continue to give us the opportunity to flex our creative muscle and demonstrate how we're reaching our target audience in unique ways."</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the new ad campaign is planned to deliver engaging experiences. Moreover, new FanDuel customers will benefit from "Think Like a Player" by tapping into unique betting markets. Those customers would also be able to engage with a special sign-up offer.</p>
<p>New clients that bet $5 may get up to $150 in Bonus Bets as a part of the special sign-up offer. Additionally, FanDuel confirmed that throughout the postseason, there will be more special offers for NBA fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>The latest ad campaign comes after only recently, FanDuel vowed support for different initiatives during March, the Problem Gambling Awareness Month. At the time of the announcement, the company revealed multiple donations and new initiatives.</p>
<p>As a part of those initiatives, FanDuel confirmed it will donate $100,000 to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and also continue to raise awareness via its Responsible Gambling Ambassador Program. Ultimately, the initiatives reaffirmed the company's commitment to fighting against problem gambling and gambling harm, while at the same time, complementing its ongoing Responsible Gaming efforts.</p>
