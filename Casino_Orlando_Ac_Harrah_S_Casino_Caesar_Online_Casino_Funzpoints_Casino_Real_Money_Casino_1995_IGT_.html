    <h1>Casino Orlando Ac Harrah S Casino Caesar Online Casino Funzpoints Casino Real Money Casino 1995 IGT</h1>

<p>Supplier of gambling and lottery products and services International Game Technology (IGT) announced today that its lottery footprint has expanded with the addition of the Michigan Lottery.</p>
<p>‘Extensive Library of Premium iLottery Content’</p>
<p>IGT Global Corporation, a subsidiary of IGT, signed an agreement with the Michigan Lottery to provide the state lottery operator with its engaging iLottery content delivered via IGT’s remote gaming server (RGS).</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, chief operating officer at IGT, outlined the benefits for the Michigan Lottery the integration with IGT’s advanced RGS solution would bring, offering players an “extensive library of premium iLottery content” while helping the Lottery diversify its product portfolio with popular “eInstants and omnichannel themes.”</p>
<p>“As a leader in this space, the Michigan Lottery has built a robust iLottery offering from the ground up, and IGT is thrilled that we can contribute to its continued success through the launch of our games,” Gendron concluded.</p>
<p>A trusted partner to the world’s most successful lotteries, IGT continues to expand its presence in the US where it powers growth in iLottery sales for its portfolio of lottery partners, providing its vast portfolio of eInstants to Georgia, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and now Michigan.</p>
<p>In June, IGT Global Corporation and the Kansan Lottery signed a 10-year contract extension related to IGT’s advanced INTELLIGEN electronic-gaming central system to keep IGT as the official technology provider for the Lottery through 2032.</p>
<p>Driving Lottery Sales Growth</p>
<p>Srini Nedunuri, vice president for Global iLottery at IGT, highlighted the company’s “proven track record” of growing iLottery sales for global lotteries, eager and excited to replicate the same result with its high-quality eInstant games with the Michigan Lottery.</p>
<p>“The addition of player-favorite IGT retail games in a digital format and exceptional licensed brands will help strengthen the Lottery’s eInstants library and provide engaging content to its players,” added Nedunuri.</p>
<p>Less than a week ago, IGT received industry-wide recognition as a leader in lottery products by being named Lottery Supplier of the Year at the 2022 SBC Awards North America event which took place in New York.</p>
<p>Outside of the lottery vertical, IGT recently finalized the acquisition of iSoftBet initially announced in April and aimed at bringing in-house the developer’s expertise by acquiring full control over its operations.</p>
<p>In addition, the acquisition doubled IGT’s PlayDigital content library expanding the product offering to the tech supplier’s partners to over 220 games and adding functionalities related to third-party integrations via iSoftBet’s aggregation distribution solution.</p>
