<p>Betway has secured a fresh partnership for the upcoming Stockholm Open, which will get underway on Sunday, November 7. Under the partnership, Betway will step in as the official betting promoter for the event and seek to expand brand awareness with tennis fans.</p>
<p>Bringing Tennis in Focus of Marketing Efforts</p>
<p>This will include signage across the active courts that will host the games as well as association rights that the brand can leverage through traditional and digital marketing channels to improve visibility.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Betway CEO Anthony Werkman welcomed the opportunity for the sports betting operator to be teaming up with one of the oldest indoor tournaments hosted by the ATP.</p>
<p>“As the world’s oldest ATP indoor tournament, the event has a fantastic history, and we’re thrilled to be their exclusive betting partner for the next three years.” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman</p>
<p>The company’s focus on tennis has been going on for several months now. In September, the brand established closer ties with the European Tour, marking an orchestrated effort to strike home with tennis audiences.</p>
<p>Stockholm Open head Kristoffer Svensson was equally pleased with the development and argued that Betway’s involvement would add to the level of fun tennis fans can expect at the six-day tournament.</p>
<p>Betway recently announced an esports event reuniting competitive video gaming organizations that have been sponsored by the operator. The Battle of Betway, as the event is dubbed, will be held on October 25, ahead of the PGL Stockholm Major, another pivotal point in competitive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
<p>Betway has been on a tear in terms of similar sponsorships and collaborations with other prominent sports organizations. The team struck a deal with Atletico Madrid earlier in October, and it already has several prominent partnerships in the face of Eintracht Frankfurt FC and Schalke 04.</p>
