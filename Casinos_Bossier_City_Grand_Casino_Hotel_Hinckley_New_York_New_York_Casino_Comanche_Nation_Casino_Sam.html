<p>Daily fantasy and sports book provider FanDuel announced Thursday it entered into a strategic partnership with The Ringer. The multifaceted deal with the sports and culture website that has been recently acquired by Spotify will be focused around sports betting.</p>
<p>The Ringer’s Exclusive Fantasy and Sports Book</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, FanDuel has been designated as the exclusive fantasy and sports book for The Ringer, with the partnership promoting an array of daily sports and sports betting contests across the media network, such as “The Ultimate Ringer”. In the contest participants will pick the winners from multiple National Football League (NFL) games per week through the regular season, as well as the NFL and NBA playoffs.</p>
<p>Besides sponsoring multiple podcast episodes across The Ringer and receiving promotion as well as newsletters for contests and events, Fanduel will present multi-week fantasy leagues that will offer a chance for the winners to receive trips to FanDuel’s World Fantasy Football and World Fantasy Basketball championships.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with The Ringer as major sports leagues return to action. They have a pulse on sports and pop culture, which has contributed to a strong and loyal following across a myriad of platforms. This exclusive partnership helps us reach and attract new customers, both avid and casual sports fans, with exciting contests and wagering opportunities.” Mike Raffensperger, Chief Marketing Officer, FanDuel</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, FanDuel quickly redefined the meaning of fantasy sports, searching for more excitement for its customers. The operator offers one-day, weekly and season-long game options for the major professional leagues in the US, the English Premier League and golf competitions. In May 2018, FanDuel was acquired by Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>FanDuel’s new strategic partner, sports and culture website found by Bill Simmons, The Ringer, was acquired by the US audio streaming subscription service Spotify, in a deal reportedly worth nearly $200 million. The deal with FanDuel made perfect sense for a sports media network, The Ringer’s Managing Director Geoff Chow outlined.</p>
<p>“Betting and fantasy are synonymous with sports, and we’re thrilled to partner with FanDuel, a leader in the industry, to further engage with our rapidly growing audience. This exclusive partnership further positions The Ringer as the premier destination for all your sports and entertainment needs.” Geoff Chow, Managing Director, The Ringer</p>
<p>As more and more states started legalizing sports betting, FanDuel was always looking to be among the first entering the market. Besides market expansion, the daily fantasy and sports book operator deepened ties with some of its partners. In June, FanDuel strengthened its ties with Swiss-based sports data company SportRadar, to gain access to official NFL data.</p>
