    <h1>Doubleu Casino Free Chips 2022 Free Online Casinos Games Hotel St Louis Casino How Much Are Rooms At</h1>

<p>France’s roster might not be as strong as four years ago when they won the World Cup in Russia, but this team sure has high ambitions for the tournament in Qatar. Winning the group is on their agenda and the bookmakers think they’re going to pull it off. That is unless one of the other three teams upsets the odds.</p>
<p>The team that looks most likely to do such a thing is Denmark, followed by Australia and Tunisia. We are sure that they are going to give their best to do so. However, we don’t think we’ll see a huge surprise happen in Group D.</p>
<p>FIFA World Cup 2022 Group D Winner Prediction – France (-227)</p>
<p>France may have some serious problems in the midfield but at least their offense and defense look incredibly strong. Over in the final third, they got the FIFA Balloon d’Or winner for 2022, Karim Benzema, as well as Killian Mbappe who’s the world’s most valuable player at the moment.</p>
<p>They’re almost as equally strong in the backfield, with players like Raphael Varane, Lucas Hernandez, Presnel Kimpembe, and others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the French, their head coach Didier Deschamps won’t be able to count on N’Golo Kante and Paul Pogba, two players who were crucial for the victory at the World Cup in 2018.</p>
<p>They might not win another trophy without those guys on the roster, but they definitely can advance to the knockout stage of the tournament from the first position in the group table.</p>
<p>Group D Runner-Up Prediction – Denmark (-110)</p>
<p>There’s going to be a real battle between Denmark, Australia, and Tunisia in Group D for the no.2 place. Still, we do think the Danes are going to qualify for the next stage of the competition. The reason is simple – they have a better team than both the Aussies and the Tunisians.</p>
<p>Their biggest star is midfielder Christian Eriksen, but we think their strongest weapon in 2022 is their defense. Their skipper Simon Kjaer will play in the center-back position, along with Andreas Christensen.</p>
<p>Getting past these two is not going to be easy, not even for the French. And even if they get through it doesn’t mean they’re going to score. Why? Because Kasper Schmeichel is standing between the posts!</p>
<p>Group D Best Prop Bet – Tunisia Not to Qualify (-500)</p>
<p>Even though Tunisia’s been playing decent soccer over the last couple of months, we don’t think these guys have the manpower to advance to the knockouts. Still, you can be sure they will have huge motivation to do so. Why? Because they’ve never gone past the group stage in history.</p>
<p>They will try, but, unfortunately for them, we don’t think they will succeed. Instead, this nation will have to wait at least another four years before getting to the World Cup Playoffs.</p>
