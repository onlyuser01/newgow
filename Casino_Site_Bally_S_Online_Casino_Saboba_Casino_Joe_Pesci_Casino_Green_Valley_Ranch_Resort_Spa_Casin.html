    <h1>Casino Site Bally S Online Casino Saboba Casino Joe Pesci Casino Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa Casin</h1>

<p>Hello. I am experiencing the following issue. I deposited 700 euros in the casino in one day and turned it into 4400 euros. When I went to withdraw my winnings, I verified my account and waited for two days. After that, my account got blocked. The explanation provided was that there were two accounts from one IP address. Essentially, I am being accused of being a scammer. However, at home we share a single router and internet provider. I also sometimes use my mobile data to access the site. The other account they're referring to belongs to my mother, who passed away four months ago. It was she who introduced me to this casino. Now, they are stating they will transfer 50 euros into her account, which was her initial deposit. Meanwhile, my account with 4400 euros will remain blocked. It seems clear who the real scammer in this situation is. I have done nothing wrong. I deposited the 700 euros from my personal account two days ago. I used my own money to play and won. I can prove it. Yet, instead of my 4400 euros, they are offering a measly 50 euros. This is incredibly unfair. I have taken screenshots of everything. My bank statements, balance in the account, my mother's death certificate - it can clearly be seen she hasn't played there since her passing. There has been no dishonesty. I am not hiding from anyone and I am not a scammer. I plan to file complaints everywhere and expose them on every forum. They need to be known for the scammers they are. They have conveniently washed their hands off this. However, they were quick to accept my 700 euros in one day. Back then, they didn't inform me about duplicated accounts. They didn't tell me this profile has been blocked, or that I can't withdraw money from it. If I had known, I wouldn't have played or deposited. I also want to note that my winnings were not due to any bonus. They were gained through my personal funds.</p>
