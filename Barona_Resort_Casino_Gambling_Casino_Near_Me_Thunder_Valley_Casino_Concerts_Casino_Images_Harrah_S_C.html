<p>IGT has been supplying solutions to the lottery for many years</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a global leader in gaming tech and solutions, has secured an agreement extension with Lotrie Nationale Belgium (LNB), the country’s national lottery. As a result, IGT will continue to supply the operator for four more years.</p>
<p>Under the extended agreement, IGT’s subsidiary, IGT Global Services, will continue to provide its partner with lottery and iLottery central systems technology and other related lottery products.</p>
<p>IGT is a global leader in lottery technology and boasts of being the primary supplier of 8 of the 10 biggest lotteries in the world. The company also supplies solutions to 16 of the top 25 lotteries.</p>
<p>IGT believes in the provision of quality and safe products that allow players to enjoy gambling without risking gambling harm. The company serves many gambling segments, including iGaming, lottery, retail and digital slots and sports betting.</p>
<p>IGT has an extensive global presence thanks to its agreements with operators, regulators and governments in over 100 regulated markets. The supplier fields around 10,500 employees and is committed to the highest possible standards of service, integrity and responsibility.</p>
<p>IGT Is a Valuable Ally to LNB</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership extension with the LNB, Jay Gendron, IGT’s chief operating officer of global lottery, said that IGT will continue to “securely power” LNB with flexible solutions. He added that IGT will continue working closely with LNB to help it remain relevant and appealing.</p>
<p>Over the course of our longtime partnership, IGT has worked closely with LNB to successfully stay ahead of ever-evolving lottery trends and innovations. IGT’s flexible core lottery and iLottery systems securely power LNB’s retail, digital and omnichannel sales, while a variety of related components support the Lottery in its efforts to offer players responsible and exciting experiences. Jay Gendron, COO global lottery, IGT</p>
<p>Jannie Haek, the chief executive officer of LNB, also commented on the deal. He noted that the two companies have been working together for many years, with IGT helping LNB with high-performing tech and expertise. Thanks to this, the Belgian lottery remained capable of innovating and driving growth.</p>
<p>This extension ensures that our lottery players will continue receiving the same high-quality experiences they enjoy at the retail point of sale and while playing compelling eInstant games online. Jannie Haek, CEO, LNB</p>
<p>Two days ago, IGT also unveiled a partnership with Dreamscape Companies, under which the provider will supply the Rio Hotel &amp; Casino property with a selection of systems. In the meantime, IGT continues to expand the presence of games like Mystery of the Lamp, Powerbucks and MegaJackpots across North America.</p>
