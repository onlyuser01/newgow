<p>Asgardian Stones review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Plenty of slot machines have tackled the world of the Vikings and the myths of the Norse Gods, but few approach from the angle Asgardian Stones takes. Here the star of the show are not the characters of that world, but its relics.</p>
<p>In place of gods and warriors, Asgardian Stones has a pile of rune marked carven faces, eerie caves and brooding choral soundtrack.</p>
<p>Asgardian Stones - Multiple Wilds win</p>
<p>It is an absorbing and beautiful approach to the subject.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>This approach is backed up by the remarkable art style. That choral soundtrack is perfectly pitched as background music that you hardly notice is there, but for the chill in your spine.</p>
<p>The stones are designed to look like a blend of Native American and old Norse art styles which look both alien and familiar.</p>
<p>Another bonus feature - crushing big tile adds a multiplier</p>
<p>As with most NetEnt productions, Asgardian Stones is also animated beautifully, the background is constantly moving and when you win the winlines are marked out in an ethereal blue glow.</p>
<p>The slot is a work of art to look at.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Although Asgardian Stones is technically a five reel slot, rather than spinning reels the symbols fall into place as blocks. The twenty winlines are then checked and any blocks that are part of a win are destroyed triggering an ‘avalanche’. New stones fall to take the place of the old and these stones rechecked for wins. The spin ends when there are no further avalanche wins.</p>
<p>Colossal symbols are part of how this work, with each symbol appearing as one (except the Wild and Bonus symbols). These Colossal symbols are either two by two or three by three sized symbols. The entire Colossal symbol is destroyed even if only part of it is used in a winning combination.</p>
<p>If there are any empty spaces under a Colossal symbol (as there might be once the winning lines have been removed from the spin), then all the symbols under the Colossal symbol are destroyed until it is resting on no empty spaces.</p>
<p>Bonus feature of Asgardian Stones slot machine</p>
<p>Each time it falls and destroys a symbol the multiplier is bumped up by one. The maximum multiplier you can win from this feature is four times your winnings.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol which doubles for any symbol except the Bonus wheel.</p>
<p>The Bonus wheel is a special type of Colossal symbol. It is three by three in size and has a wheel on it which stops spinning once the other wins have been calculated for that spin. When the wheel stops it awards either free spins or a payout of coins. There is a maximum coin payout of 36 times the bet per spin.</p>
<p>The bonus wheel with a chance of winning up to 15 free spins</p>
<p>If the block covers three rows, you win three prizes off the wheel and so on down to one if the block rests on the top row.</p>
<p>During the free spins, a Colossal Wild is added which breaks up into nine single Wild blocks. This allows for more wins as these blocks can then be part of avalanche wins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player for Asgardian Stones is 96.31% which is not too bad when compared to the trends in the industry.</p>
<p>The slot is moderately volatile. We prefer high volatility slots.</p>
<p>Asgardian Stones - Top symbols paytable</p>
<p>The site we tested allowed a minimum bet of £/$/€0.20 as you must play all twenty winlines. The maximum bet was £/$/€200 per spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A beautiful slot machine with great visuals and some lovely design elements. The features are solid and the RTP decent. However, we would normally look for higher volatility in a slot we would recommend.</p>
<p>Close, Asgardian Stones, but not quite cigar-worthy.</p>
