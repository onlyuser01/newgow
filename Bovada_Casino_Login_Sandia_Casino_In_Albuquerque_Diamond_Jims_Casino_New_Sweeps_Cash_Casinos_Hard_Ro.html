<p>Better Collective, the sports media specializing in educational platforms for the online casino industry, announced today it has signed a media partnership with The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>Quality Content for Readers Interested in Gaming</p>
<p>Under the new media partnership with The Philadelphia Inquirer, Better Collective will deliver innovative technology and engaging sports betting and iGaming content to the readers of the publication with a readership of up to 10 million per month.</p>
<p>“Philadelphia has some of the most passionate and knowledgeable sports fans in the country and this business partnership with Better Collective through Action Network allows us to offer quality content to readers who are interested in sports betting and iGaming.” Lisa Hughes, Publisher and CEO, The Inquirer</p>
<p>Better Collective’s subsidiary, Action Network, will deliver the content, data, and statistics under the partnership that will provide an additional marketing channel for Better Collective in terms of operating, managing and marketing customer data to sports betting and online casino gaming operators.</p>
<p>Education and Experience Enhancement</p>
<p>Also commenting on the media partnership, Marc Pedersen, vice president and chief executive officer at Better Collective US, outlined the company’s strong belief that providing bettors with relevant information, data and statistics not only educates them but also enhances their experience.</p>
<p>“The partnership with The Philadelphia Inquirer will allow us to reach a very large number of potential users, and we are excited to partner with the publication to provide engaging content to a growing audience.” Marc Pedersen, VP and CEO, Better Collective US</p>
<p>Both parties expect to launch the partnership in August, providing readers of The Philadelphia Inquirer with sports betting content, data and statistics directly on the publication’s website to help them learn more about their favorite sports and teams.</p>
<p>Reach a Larger Audience</p>
<p>On behalf of Action Network, chief executive officer Patrick Keane outlined the new partnership would be beneficial to readers of The Philadelphia Inquirer as Action’s “unique sports betting insights and premium content” will help them decide where to put their wagers, utilizing the expertise of Action’s “deep roster of talented sports betting experts.”</p>
<p>The partnership will also help the “purpose-driven” Action Network to reach a larger audience with its products and analytics and serve bettors of all levels of betting experience, Keane concluded.</p>
<p>The media partnership with The Philadelphia Inquirer is the latest for the sports media which signed its first media partnership in 2019.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Better Collective teamed with the New York Post to provide its readers with a detailed breakdown of sports events, including data, content, statistics, as well as a dedicated betting section.</p>
