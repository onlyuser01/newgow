    <h1>Best Casinos Online How Many Casinos Are In Atlantic City Bayou Casino Catalina Casino Carson City C</h1>

<p>GeoComply has thrown its weight around in formidable ways over the past months. The company, which is a leader in geolocation, fraud, and risk services, has been able to sway Kentucky and its somewhat hesitant lawmakers to push through with regulating sports gambling.</p>
<p>GeoComply has repeatedly proved that it’s able to "geo-fence" and protect newly-regulated iGaming and online betting markets by deploying advanced tech solutions that are meant to ensure that consumers are safe. To achieve this and more, the company has relied on a team of highly-trained and experienced Risk Services experts.</p>
<p>The latest member of the company’s division is former US Secret Service Special Agent Michael Dawson who will strengthen the company’s capabilities and use a network, contacts, and hands-on experience to help GeoComply bring its product to the next level.</p>
<p>Commenting on this appointment, GeoComply Director of Risk Services Danny DiRienzo had this to say: "While automating fraud alerts is a big part of what we do to protect our customers, we have found that machines still don’t learn as fast as fraud evolves."</p>
<p>DiRienzo explained that the company’s success was owing to both human analysis and data science. This is why Dawson makes a meaningful addition to the team. Dawson has more than 23 years of experience working with the Secret Service, and he worked as a leading investigator on cybercrime, fraud, and money laundering, with a particular focus on cryptocurrencies during his time in the force.</p>
<p>Dawson will serve as Law Enforcement Liaison within GeoComply, as the company continues to evolve its product to meet new challenges posed by the criminal world. The team at GeoComply works tireless, however, to ensure that what services it offers ultimately help customers mitigate security risks or help escalate them to law enforcement agencies when and if required.</p>
<p>Dawson himself was very happy with his appointment, saying that it was a natural continuation of his career trajectory. "Geolocation is such an effective tool. If more of the banks and platforms I helped had used GeoComply, it would have made investigations a lot simpler and the life of the criminals a lot harder," he commented on his appointment.</p>
<p>His experience in investigating cryptocurrency-related cybercrime is just part of the experience he will bring to GeoComply’s ever-evolving team of specialists.</p>
