    <h1>Aruba Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Yabby Casino 225 No Deposit Bonus Casinos Near Syracuse Ny Sh</h1>

<p>With the Super Bowl LIV just a few days away, sports bettors in West Virginia will be delighted to know that they now have some more options when it comes to the venues where they will be able to place their bets. The state is one of the growing numbers of states that capitalized on the Supreme Court ruling that abolished PASPA and gave way to the legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>West Virginia’s growing gambling market is one of the most lucrative ones in the country hence the interest from a number of leading sports betting brands.</p>
<p>Roar Digital’s BetMGM Sports Betting App</p>
<p>About a week ago, Roar Digital unveiled the BetMGM mobile sports betting app in West Virginia. The launch of the sports betting app was in partnership with a privately-owned resort and casino in the state that is known as The Greenbrier.</p>
<p>At launch, BetMGM became the third mobile sports betting app to go live in the state. It will be joining renowned sports betting operators DraftKings and FanDuel which both went live in August 2019.</p>
<p>With these apps, sports bettors will be able to place bets on their favorites sporting activities from anywhere within the state. All they have to do to get started is to download the apps and registers. To register sports betting accounts they do not have to visit affiliated retail casinos which makes the process tremendously simple. This is not the case in a number of states where sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>IGT and Delaware North Partner Up for the WV Sports Betting</p>
<p>Another option for sports bettors in West Virginia has also been recently announced by International Gaming Technology (IGT) and Delaware North Companies Gaming &amp; Entertainment Inc., its new gaming partner. Unlike the other sports betting operators who have opted to focus on digital gaming, Delaware North and IGT intend to offer both retail and mobile sports betting.</p>
<p>As it turns out, in addition to powering Mardi Gras Casino &amp; Resort in Cross Lanes and Wheeling Island Casino-Hotel-Racetrack in Wheeling Island with its sports betting technology, IGT’s partnership with the operator will extend beyond the state. Delaware North’s Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis, Arkansas will also be using IGT’s top-of-the-line PlaySports technology.</p>
<p>For now, IGT and Delaware North are focusing on the retails sports betting offerings in West Virginia. There are plans for mobile sports betting but no specific timelines or launch dates have been announced. Perhaps the goal is to wait for the state’s nascent digital sports betting market to mature a bit more before they can dive in. Retail sports betting, on the other hand, has been performing exceptionally well in the state. This makes it a great place to start.</p>
