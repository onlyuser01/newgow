<p>Peaky Blinders review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Peaky Blinders fans will find themselves playing on the streets of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Based on the hit period crime drama, this game offers a dark and moody atmosphere. Characters from Thomas Shelby to Polly Gray peer out as if inviting players to join them for a life in the underworld.</p>
<p>As the coal dust settles and sparks fly, joining the gang is irresistible.</p>
<p>Epic Win in the Peaky Blinders slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With subdued smoky hues and realistic animation, the graphics provide a similar experience to the show’s opening. The restrained colour palette and high definition images give a slick feel to this world.</p>
<p>Haunting background music increases tension with the characteristic Peaky Blinders’s percussion sequences. However, the recognisable clip loops frequently, which may grow tedious for even the biggest fans. This is easily solved with the menu option to silence the sound.</p>
<p>With the show’s most prominent characters featured, Peaky Blinders lovers won’t be disappointed. The characters glow and softly smile in response to players’ wins, furthering the feeling of collusion with them.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Peaky Blinders is a five reel slot machine. Each reel has three rows. The game has twenty win lines.</p>
<p>There is no gamble feature. There are two bonus features (see below for details).</p>
<p>This pretty standard stuff and slot players will find what they normally expect.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol, Shelby Betting Shop symbol, and By Order of the Peaky Blinders.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol appears on reels 1 and 3.</p>
<p>Players are awarded the Free Spin bonus when they land a combo of two Bonus symbols along with either a Shelby Betting Shop symbol or a By Order of the Peaky Blinders symbol.</p>
<p>The Shelby Betting Shop symbol only appears on reel 5. Players trigger the Shelby Betting Shop feature whenever a Shelby Betting Shop symbol appears without two Bonus symbols also appearing.</p>
<p>During the Shelby Betting Shop feature a random direct money award is given to all character symbols.</p>
<p>Appearing only on reel 5, the By Order of the Peaky Blinders symbol triggers the By Order of the Peaky Blinders feature. This can only occur when it lands without two Bonus symbols on the other reels.</p>
<p>In the By Order of the Peaky Blinders feature, the winlines on the screen pay and after this all character symbols and Wild symbols remain in place. Then, players are given a free respin. Following this, all Wild symbols and character symbols change into a randomly assigned character symbol. Throughout this feature special reels are in play.</p>
<p>Shelby Betting Shop feature reveals cash prizes for all high paying symbols</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%, well over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for Peaky Blinders slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We strongly recommend this high volatility, high RTP Peaky Blinders-themed slot.</p>
<p>Between its excellent strategy stats and its moody front end design, this game is an engaging choice for players.</p>
<p>Fans of the show will love the atmosphere and the sense that they’ve joined the crew. Even players unfamiliar with the hit series will likely enjoy the narrative, volatility and RTP.</p>
<p>The variety of bonus features keep things interesting and players will find it easy to get swept up in the crime and coal dust.</p>
