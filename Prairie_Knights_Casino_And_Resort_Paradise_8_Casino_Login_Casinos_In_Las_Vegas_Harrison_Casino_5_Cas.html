    <h1>Prairie Knights Casino And Resort Paradise 8 Casino Login Casinos In Las Vegas Harrison Casino 5 Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I created an account with MBit Casino as far back as March 18th, 2021, using my email address pascalschmerler@web.de.</p>
<p>A day later, I sent an email to the Casino informing them about my gambling addiction and requested that they permanently suspend my account without any possibility of reopening it.</p>
<p>Sadly, as a gambling addict, it's not easy to help oneself. However, I started by sending an email to all the casinos where I was registered, detailing my addiction and asking for my account to be suspended.</p>
<p>Gradually, I sought to black out myself from all casinos and applied for a ban from several Dama N.V casinos due to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Since then, I am unable to register or create an account with Dama Casinos. And if by some chance I do, I am unable to make any payments.</p>
<p>Thus, I notified the Casino about my gambling addiction two years ago and haven't logged into the account since then. I confirmed this today via Live Chat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as it happens with addicts, I found myself searching for casinos today and tried to register with MBit Casino. When I got notified that my email address was already in use, I attempted to log in. I was able to access my account and made deposits totalling approx â‚¬1300 via Ethereum.</p>
<p>I played, lost all of the money and emailed the Casino. Upon quick investigation, it dawned on me that I should not have been allowed to play in this Casino because I had previously requested account closure over two years ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should not have been possible for me to register with Dama Casinos.</p>
<p>The Casino has therefore violated measures put in place for gambling addiction prevention since, as I mentioned earlier, I should never have been allowed to play in their Casino. Consequently, I am demanding a refund on all the deposits made today.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that you will support my case and I'm ready to provide any information you require.</p>
<p>I'm also attaching other exclusion notices from Dama N.V. Casinos, for the sake of clarity. I'm aware that a closure of one casino account doesn't automatically apply to all other casinos. However, in this situation, I contacted MBit Casino directly and my account was not closed.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Pascal Schmerler</p>
