<p>Fredrik Elmqvist Joins ParlayBay’s Board</p>
<p>Having Elmqvist join the Board complements the company’s growth strategy. In his new position, the iGaming industry veteran is expected to spearhead ParlayBay’s growth and help achieve strategic objectives in 2023, a new report released by SBC reveals.</p>
<p>With Elmqvist as a part of the Board, the company anticipates further expansion of its quickfire and micro-betting games to new jurisdictions. This makes the recent announcement a strategic appointment in ParlayBay’s plan for growth. What’s more, the company acknowledged that Elmqvist brings significant industry experience. This experience makes him an invaluable member of the company’s Board. In addition, the announcement comes amid the 2022 FIFA World Cup, one of the most-anticipated soccer events recently.</p>
<p>“ParlayBay is such an exciting opportunity. Reactions from both operators and the players to the sports betting product are very positive, so it was an easy decision to accept to chair ParlayBay and support them as much as I can in their venture.“ Fredrik Elmqvist, chair of the Board of ParlayBay</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Elmqvist said that joining ParlayBay represents an exciting opportunity. He added that the company’s products are well-received by the growing sports betting audience. This, according to Elmqvist pushed him to join ParlayBay and boost its ongoing growth further.</p>
<p>Elmqvist pointed out that he knew the company’s CFO and CEO for years which made the decision to join ParlayBay even easier. Finally, he said: “For what I have already seen ParlayBay has a truly inspiring can-do attitude which takes me back to the first couple of years with Yggdrasil.”</p>
<p>Elmqvist Brings Rich Industry Experience</p>
<p>Before joining ParlayBay’s Board, Elmqvist founded the leading provider of online gaming solutions for the iGaming industry, Yggdrasil Gaming Ltd, more than 10 years ago. For nearly a decade he served as the company’s CEO and director before in April, he transferred the CEO responsibilities to Björn Krantz.</p>
<p>“We warmly welcome Fredrik as COB, to join us in the ParlayBay endeavor, to create a game changing sport betting proposition to the iGaming industry.“ Patrick Nordwall, CEO at ParlayBay</p>
<p>Patrick Nordwall, ParlayBay’s CEO, welcomed Elmqvist to the company’s senior management team. He acknowledged that Elmqvist joins the company at the perfect time as it prepares to expand the reach of its portfolio on a global scale. Last but not least, Nordwall said: “Fredrik will also be able to bring value in our ambition to accelerate growth, profitability, and market reach.”</p>
