<p>EveryMatrix, one of the largest iGaming companies and provider of solutions for multiple verticals in the gambling industry, has secured another milestone with the company receiving an approval from the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>The approval has to do with EveryMatrix’s gamification solution specifically – JackpotEngine, which is an advanced way for partner operators and brands to leverage jackpot solutions into their core offer – and specifically into any games they choose to.</p>
<p>What this means is that EveryMatrix may now move forward with JackpotEngine and have it featured in hundreds of brands that carry a Malta Gaming Authority licensure. JackpotEngine is deployed through EveryMatrix’s productivity platform CasinoEngine, which comes together with all the necessary features to make the experience smooth for businesses in terms of integration and players – in terms of gameplay.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine similarly features a Jackpot Management System which facilitates the backend use of the solution and allows operators to adjust the particulars of any jackpot smoothly and quickly, as well as the games that it will cover. The solution allows brands to experience a significant uptake in their player acquisition and retention rates, making it a worthwhile addition across the board.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, EveryMatrix Head of Casino Engine Stian Enger said that there has been extensive testing done in the "first phase of release," and the results were already promising. According to Enger, there has been an "uplift" in game rounds, session times, and bet size, all thanks to the JackpotEngine solution, which the executive described as a "game changer."</p>
<p>‘I’m delighted with the MGA approval, and this will significantly boost the product’s rollout in the months to come," Enger concluded. JackpotEngine is presently available to EveryMatrix partner operators through the deployment of the CasinoEngine or SlotMatrix, another solution used to help operators get access to thousands of games brought by hundreds of quality and hand-picked studios, such as Spinberry and Rogue.</p>
<p>The company has done particularly well across its first quarter this year, with EveryMatrix reporting a significant increase in its revenue coming from its iGaming operations, which are only getting started in the North American market, for example. Erik Nyman, the company’s President of Americas, spoke of the accelerated iGaming growth in the region and what is to follow for the company.</p>
<p>Although a Malta Gaming Authority approval focuses mostly on European brands, it’s still an important step forward for EveryMatrix’s overall place in the iGaming sector.</p>
