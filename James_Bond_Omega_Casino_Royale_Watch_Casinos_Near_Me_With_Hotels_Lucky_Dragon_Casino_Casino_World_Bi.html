<p>Bison Battle review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bison Battle is themed around the American wilderness, especially its iconic wildlife.</p>
<p>Players will soar through canyons and arrive in the company of bobcats, bald eagles, and bears. These fierce animals will guide them through the unforgiving landscape.</p>
<p>This slot also features Native American aesthetics and artifacts, including a bow and arrow and decorative feathers. This is definitely more of a fantasy depiction than a realistic one, but still adds to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Big win in the Bison Battle slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The epic soundtrack is infused with Western flavour, highlighting the majestic setting. Players will feel the drama of stepping out into the wild.</p>
<p>Each of the animals among the symbols looks ferocious, with the bobcat’s teeth fully bared. The American bald eagle is particularly striking and his feathers are accented with tribal designs.</p>
<p>The show-stopping animal is the bison as he charges straight towards the player, his forehead richly adorned with enigmatic patterns.</p>
<p>Two Red Bison symbols run in opposite direction</p>
<p>The lower paying symbols take the form of card suits in bright hues and decorative engravings consistent with the Native American aesthetics.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a sweeping desert landscape.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Bison Battle is a five-reel, four-row slot, with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild Bison symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Red Bison, Blue Bison, and Green Bison symbols.</p>
<p>The Blue Bison and Green Bison symbols are Scatter symbols. They will both only land on the first reel.</p>
<p>The Red Bison symbol only lands on reels 1 and 5 during the base game. If players land a Red Bison symbol on the first reel, they will be awarded an instant prize in the form of a bet multiplier. This multiplier could be x5, x10, x25, x50, x100, x250, x500, x1000, or x2500.</p>
<p>If two Red Bison symbols are on the same row, bonus feature is triggered</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Red Bison symbol that lands in reel 5 will have a multiplier value between x1 and x10 associated with it. The Red Bison then moves one reel to the left with each spin. Should the Red Bison land on reel one, the Red Bison moves in the opposite direction, shifting one to the right with each spin.</p>
<p>If players land Red Bison symbols in the same row of reels 1 and 5, the Bison Clash feature begins. The pair of Red Bison symbols clash and the instant prize is multiplied by the multiplier.</p>
<p>The Ice Park feature begins if players land a Blue Bison symbol as well as a Red Bison symbol in the same row. This feature begins with 3 free spins and offers additional opportunities for multipliers and prizes.</p>
<p>Red Bison symbol multiplies all symbols in its row everytime it shows up</p>
<p>If players land a Green Bison symbol and a Red Bison symbol in the same row, the Green Valley feature begins. This feature starts with 8 free spins and features Sticky Wilds and additional multipliers.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.4%, which is above our yardstick for average RTP of roughly 96%. With a slight bump in RTP for players that buy directly into the bonuses (up to 96.69%).</p>
