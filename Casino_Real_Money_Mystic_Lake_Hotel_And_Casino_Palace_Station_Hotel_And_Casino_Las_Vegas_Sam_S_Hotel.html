    <h1>Casino Real Money Mystic Lake Hotel And Casino Palace Station Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Sam S Hotel</h1>

<p>I received a $100 No Deposit Bonus. which I played through. By the time I completed my play through, I had accumulated about $1000. Before I processed the withdrawal, the Bonus $100 was deducted, which was correct. I cashed out $500 and then another $300. The balance, I played with until it was gone. A couple days later on 4/15/21, it showed that the $300 was processed and completed. for some reason it also said forfeited. While I was waiting for the agent to chat, I reversed the $500 withdraw and lost the $500. When I finally spoke to the agent, I was told the $300 withdraw was forfeited and that I would not be able to get the $300.</p>
<p>Don't play at this casino, there is no such thing as fairplay.</p>
<p>As a side note, I did deposit over $150 to this casino on 4/15/21, and lost that funds. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>This is a SCAM Casino. BEWARE!</p>
