    <h1>Skrill Casino Aqua Caliente Casino Palm Springs Pechanga Casino Resort Directions To San Manuel Casi</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming Group has expanded its gamification and player engagement product, Fuze. The product will now be made available to sportsbooks which will give B2B partners the opportunity to explore further opportunities to build stronger ties with target audiences and existing customers.</p>
<p>Deploying Fuze to Help Sportsbooks Excel</p>
<p>Fuze’s toolset is already available as part of Bragg’s online casino content through the company’s dedicated distribution platform. However, the product will now also be leveraged by sportsbook partners or iGaming operators that run both online casino and sports betting verticals.</p>
<p>Fuze will help companies achieve better gamification in real-time leveraging data and driving betting demand through promotions and other solutions. Bragg’s Fuze solutions are tailored to the specific tastes of target audiences. For example, customers may be asked to participate in a leaderboard where try to get the outcomes of every World Cup group stage match right for a chance to grab a sizable reward.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Fuze makes it possible to promote sports betting in a variety of innovative ways that strike home with players and turn them from passive customers into active consumers. The technology can also be leveraged to build loyalty programs and elicit stronger reactions from players. Fuze is also regulation-ready, meaning that the platform is always being adjusted to the specific local regulatory rules and mandates.</p>
<p>Fuze has an easy-to-set-up overall campaign manager, which can boost results for partner sportsbooks. The back office is user-friendly and offers seamless integration with all sportsbook engines.</p>
<p>Fuze has already made its debut with a leading sportsbook in the Netherlands. Bragg launched the solution with BetCity.nl a week ago.</p>
<p>Bragg Sees Strong Uptake in Fuze Tech for Sports</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bragg’s chief technology officer Peter Lavric has been very optimistic about this new expansion and repurposing of Fuze’s efforts. He said:</p>
<p>We have high hopes for this solution as it enables sports fans to enjoy actively competing with each other, rather than passively following the events they love. Our engagement tools take the experience that punters get from sports betting to a whole new level while for operators, Fuze significantly helps drive business performance. Bragg’s chief technology officer Peter Lavric</p>
<p>The more aggressive roll-out of the Fuze platform comes at an important time for Bragg with the company posting a record revenue handle, and the company upping the ante on both the online casino and sports betting vertical.</p>
