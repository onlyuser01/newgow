    <h1>Downstream Casino Resort Hotel Lvh Las Vegas Hotel Casino Casino Hotels In Laughlin Nevada Betmgm Ca</h1>

<p>It‚Äôs time for the third golf major of 2023. From Friday, June 16 to Tuesday, June 20, the Los Angeles Country Club will be the world golfing capital ‚Äì that‚Äôs where the 2023 US Open will take place</p>
<p>The prize pool of the 2023 US Open is $17.5 million, but money is just one on a long list of reasons why every player will give their utmost. The main reason why Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, Jon Rahm, and everyone else will be super-motivated to win the US Open is that this is a thing of prestige. If you want to challenge for a GOAT status in golf, you need as many US Open titles as possible.</p>
<p>2023 US Open Golf Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Scottie Scheffler +650 Jon Rahm +900 Brooks Koepka +1100 Rory McIlroy +1100 Patrick Cantlay +1400 Viktor Hovland +1600 Xander Schauffele +1800 Jordan Spieth +2000 Cameron Smith +2500 Max Homa +2800 Matt Fitzpatrick +3000 Collin Morikawa +3000 Tony Finau +3000 Tyrrell Hatton +3000</p>

<p>Top 2023 US Open (Golf) Favorites</p>
<p>Scottie Scheffler is sitting at the top of the favorites list for the 2023 US Open, but his record this year does not look that great. The winner of last year‚Äôs Masters Tournament finished tied for 10th place in this year‚Äôs Masters while finishing tied-second in the PGA Championship.</p>
<p>He did, however, impress in The Players Championship, which he won by five strokes. The win got him to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking, but he‚Äôs dropped from that place since. Heading into the 2023 US Open, he‚Äôs sitting in the No.3 position.</p>
<p>Of course, if the bookies are right and he ends up winning the tournament in California, we could see him reclaim the top spot. However, it‚Äôs not going to be easy to do so as competition is very fierce. As per US Open Championship odds, his closest competitor is Jon Rahm, who seems to love playing on the West Coast ‚Äì this guy‚Äôs already won two events in California this year.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka Mustn‚Äôt be Underestimated</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka is a two-time US Open winner who‚Äôs been great in 2023. This year, he‚Äôs already won one major (PGA Championship), as well as finished tied second in another one (the Masters Tournament).</p>
<p>It‚Äôs officially U.S Open week. Good luck to Brooks Koepka, this generations best major championship golfer, as he tries for his 3rd U.S Open, 2nd major victory of the year, and 6th total major win of his already hall of fame career. pic.twitter.com/puh1Ou2eo4 ‚Äî Tour Pro üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@OfficialTourPro) June 12, 2023</p>
<p>This guy definitely has the experience needed to bag another major. However, so do many other golfers who are coming to California this week, most notably, Rory McIlroy.</p>
<p>The Northern Irishman is the US Open Championship aggregate and par record-holder, but these records were set 12 years ago. Now a 34-year-old, McIlroy has been without a win at a major tournament in seven years. Is that too long of a wait?</p>
<p>2023 US Open Golf Championship Prediction</p>
<p>Which golfer is going to win the US Open in 2023? Our pick is Brooks Koepka. Priced at +1100, he‚Äôs seen as one of the main contenders for the trophy, but in our eyes, he‚Äôs the No. 1 favorite.</p>
<p>The thing is that when it comes to the US Open Golf Championship, players with the shortest odds rarely come on top. In fact, the betting favorite won just once in the last six editions of the US Open. This is another reason why we think backing Koepka wouldn‚Äôt be too crazy.</p>
<p>Pick: Brooks Koepka to win</p>
