    <h1>Casinos In The Us Borgata Online Casino Login Live Casino Restaurants Directions To Hard Rock Casino</h1>

<p>Dear joeblack1,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience with Flappy Casino.</p>
<p>I checked the casino's responsible gambling section and found this:</p>
<p>"You can always contact our support department at support@flappycasino.com and ask to terminate your Flappy account for a certain period of time. After that we will take necessary measures to completely block you from our site and block any promotional e-mails that you might have been receiving from our casino before.</p>
<p>Please contact customer support team if you want to set a personal cooling-off period."</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, clearly state the reason for deactivating your account and specify the time period. Also, the email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as the casino support receives many requests per day. If it is marked visibly you will stand a better chance of having your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (permanently).</p>
<p>The reason for my decision is xxx (your reason).</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and that the self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@flappycasino.com (you can CC me at tomas@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments.</p>
<p>If this request doesn't work within a few days, please let me know and we'll intervene.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
