<p>MLB and Arizona have something in common. They both ushered in a new era last month as MLB held its Opening Day on April 1, after having had to change up the schedule last year due to COVID-19, and the state approving sports gambling a short time later. With the passage of that legislation, Arizona made it possible for its professional sports teams to get in on the action and the Arizona Diamondbacks haven’t wasted any time. The MLB team is now partnered with Caesars Entertainment, ready to bring sports gambling to Chase Field, its home stadium.</p>
<p>Sports Gambling Continues Expansion</p>
<p>Baseball park vendors might not yet be ready to hand out hot dogs, peanuts and wagering slips, but that day might come. For now, D-backs fans will have to settle for the new Caesars sportsbook coming to the Plaza, the entertainment area located next to Chase Field in downtown Phoenix. There, the gaming operator will be putting up a sportsbook, a sports bar and a broadcast studio, using what was previously the Game 7 Grill. Caesars and the Diamondbacks have some time to work out the details because, even though sports gambling was approved last month, the framework is still being developed and it isn’t yet known when the first wagers will be allowed.</p>
<p>Caesars will have a robust program established through its arrangement with the MLB team. It will launch mobile sports gambling and will be the exclusive sponsor of sports gambling and daily fantasy sports activity tied to the D-backs. Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars, explains that this is going to be an opportunity to “create new ways for baseball fans to engage” with baseball, adding that the operator is going to link its Caesars Rewards network to its Arizona activity, giving sports fans an “unbeatable experience.”</p>
<p>Caesars Now More Than a Casino Operator</p>
<p>Caesars has been quick to react to the changing gaming market in the US, expanding its operations and understanding that there is a major transformation occurring. Land-based casino operators have to adjust to the rapid growth of iGaming and sports gambling, and the company has developed a strong presence in both. It is now an official betting partner for the NFL and the recent completion of its acquisition of William Hill greatly expands its digital footprint. In addition to partnering with the NFL, Caesars has signed a multi-year deal to be an authorized gaming operator for MLB.</p>
<p>Caesars also operates iGaming sites in states that have legalized online gaming. All of these new arrangements are going to give the company a more solid foundation moving forward as land-based gaming is relegated to second place behind digital alternatives. The full transition is likely at least a decade away, but Caesars is prepared.</p>
