<p>Tipico has made another splash in the United States market, launching in a fourth state in the country, and bringing its sports betting options to a new local market</p>
<p>The launch was approved by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, allowing the company to begin accepting bets in the Hawkeye State.</p>
<p>Tipico Goes Live in Iowa, Marking Its Fourth US Entry</p>
<p>The entry into Iowa follows previous expansion moves in New Jersey, Ohio, and Colorado, which are the other jurisdictions where the company is present in the United States as of right now.</p>
<p>This launch marks a significant milestone for Tipico which hopes to continue expanding throughout the United States, as many other states are now actively discussing the potential legalization of their sports gambling industries..</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are a number of already licensed states where Tipico could seek to strengthen its presence. However, Tipico also seems inclined to stay ahead of the pack rather than simply trailing other brands in already established markets.</p>
<p>The priority has been to launch into recently regulated jurisdictions. Commenting on this, CEO of Tipico USA, Adrian Vella, said that the company was thrilled to further expand its footprint in the market. He elaborated:</p>
<p>Iowa betters will be able to use a very simple product with fast deposits and withdrawals, experience cutting edge functionality in Live betting, SGP+ with wide coverage on player props, and can cash out anytimeâ€” including partial cash-out capabilities. CEO of Tipico USA, Adrian Vella</p>
<p>The company uses its own proprietary technology to power next-generation sports betting experiences. The company entered the US market in December 2020 and has been expanding rapidly. Today, Tipico provides a desktop and mobile experience, powered by the Android and iOS apps it offers.</p>
<p>Tipico has been looking to actively increase its footprint in the United States. The company launched a free-to-play betting deal ahead of the official January 1, 2023, rollout of the entire market. There has been a lot of chatter about new markets legalizing their sports gambling industry. States such as Kentucky, Texas, and most recently Maine are making somewhat determined first steps.</p>
<p>Where Tipico makes its next move remains to be seen.</p>
