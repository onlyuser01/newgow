    <h1>Old Havana Casino Washington Casino Grand Casino Hotel Resort Slotswin Casino How Tall Is The Strato</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal from this casino called club player casino. I was under the impression that the withdrawal would be approved within 3 business days of being requested because that's what it said in the terms and conditions. When I filled out my withdrawal request I put in btc address; bc1qt3f869g9m3h9tujyv2avnneg55aaesumvpaf53 but when C.P.C sent the payment they sent it to a different address. They sent it to 1N1HcNGVoC7RFeNGcLrgauVuu9raaBH7HQ. You can see that they sent the btc payment in the blockchain but you can also see that nobody sold the btc that was sent to that address. I could watch, on the bitcoin blockchain, while my btc payment lost over half its value sitting in the wrong address. I couldn't do anything to get it out because it wasn't my address. I wasnt sure if I was to blame at first it wasn't until I had a chat with Tony Martinez from the club player casino that I realized it wasn't my fault and it was their fault. I only ever withdrawaled from this casino using 1 btc address. Well if you look at the screen shot Tony Martinez clearly says that my payment was sent to bc1qt3f869g9m3h9tujyv2avnneg55aaesumvpaf53. But when you look at my conversation with the payments team in my email you can clearly see them saying that they sent the payment to 1N1HcNGVoC7RFeNGcLrgauVuu9raaBH7HQ and they lie and say that they got the address from me. Just from the screenshot of Tony Martinez saying that my payment was sent to the other address, after i asked him to look up the withdrawal request that I filled out, that's proof that there are two addresses that they have on file for me when there should only be one because the only time I requested a withdrawal was for the $900 that im missing. I messed up and didn't screen shot the parts where Tony said they were at fault and they sent the payment to the wrong address but I guarantee they have a copy of that whole conversation and could show anyone that wanted to see it at any time. I didn't think to screen shot that whole conversation because Tony was telling me that they were gonna make it right. He even asked me for an updated btc address so that they could send the payment to the right address this time. He was so believable that I didn't think that any foul play was going to happen after that conversation. But the next time I talked to a CPC agent they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and I had to go back over the whole situation with a new agent. Then when I talk to the payments team on my email they totally mix my words up and act like they don't know exactly what I'm talking about. They can easily tell that they sent the payment to the wrong address but they can't admit that because whoever did that is going to get fired for sure. I gotta hope that someone takes a real look at my story. I've been trying to get this money for over a year now. Here are the screen shots. The first one is of Tony mistakenly telling me that the payments were sent to btc address bc1qt3f869g9m3h9tujyv2avnneg55aaesumvpaf53. The next one is of the payments team telling me that they sent the same payments to btc address 1N1HcNGVoC7RFeNGcLrgauVuu9raaBH7HQ and wrongfully accusing me of giving them that address. Both screen shots are about the same withdrawal requests. I have put in a lot of hours trying to get this money from this casino. There was another withdrawal request that never made it past approval because it sat in limbo for over a month. It sat for so long that I was bored and broke one day so I cancelled that request and put it back into the casino. But I believe that I deserve to receive that withdrawal also not just because of all the stress this casino put me through over the past year but because broke the terms and conditions by not approving and sending out my payment within the 3 business days they say it will take recieve a withdrawal. That withdrawal was worth another $900. If this was fair I would get $1800 from this casino. I will attach all of my withdrawal request confirmation emails so you can see that I requested withdrawals on 11/21/21, 11/25/21, and 12/05/21 and they didn't send out a payment until 1/30/22. I cancelled the third withdrawal on 1/9/22 and put it back in the casino. If they would have just sent it when they were supposed to that would have never happened. Thank you for your time. I may be reaching since I'm asking for a withdrawal request that I cancelled to be paid out to me but if I didn't follow the terms and conditions then I wouldn't have had a chance to get a payment because they would just flat out not pay me. Since they can use the terms and conditions to not pay me I should be able to use them to make them pay me when they don't abide by them. Thank you for your time.</p>
