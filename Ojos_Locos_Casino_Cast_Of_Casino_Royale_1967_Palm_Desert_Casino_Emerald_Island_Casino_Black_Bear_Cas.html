<p>Players can compete in weekly contests and win a variety of prizes</p>
<p>Rivalry Corp, a leading iGaming and online sports betting operator among younger players, has teamed up with innovation and gamification specialist Low6 to release a new NBA fantasy game. The new title is called Rivalry Ultimate Fan and comes just in time for the NBA season.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the newly launched title taps into the rise of trading card culture, collectibles, and pack openings to engage basketball fans. The free-to-play fantasy basketball title allows users to open digital packs, collect NBA athletes and create their dream teams.</p>
<p>Players can also compete in weekly contests and win a number of prizes. These include exclusive NBA merchandise, gift cards and Rivalry promotions.</p>
<p>In addition, Rivalry teased its plans to release physical booster packs full of illustrated cards of NBA players. Players can also get QR codes that allow them to claim additional prizes. For example, the packs may contain “The Big Baller” card, a holographic card that will award two tickets to the 2024 NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Rivalry will also team up with its creator partners to livestream booster pack openings throughout the season.</p>
<p>In addition, the company plans to give back to basketball fans and local communities by refurbishing neglected basketball courts. Registered users can submit their local courts to the program for a chance to have it restored in the near future.</p>
<p>Rivalry Ultimate Fan will be available for download to both Android and iOS users.</p>
<p>The announcement comes just as PrizePicks launched a free-to-play product in Michigan.</p>
<p>The New Product Aligns with Rivalry and Low6’s Philosophies</p>
<p>Steven Salz, Rivalry’s co-founder and chief executive officer, commented on the new deal, saying that the game is a perfect addition to the company’s fantasy sports lineup. He pointed out that the expansion into the traditional sports segment allows Rivalry to tap into new opportunities.</p>
<p>Expanding further into the traditional sports segment enables us to introduce the unique betting experience we’ve built to a new community of players and realize the operating leverage we see in other parts of the business among a broader audience. Steven Salz, co-founder &amp; CEO, Rivalry Corp</p>
<p>Salz praised Low6 for the innovative product it delivered and said that Rivalry Ultimate Fan fits well into Rivalry’s strategy.</p>
<p>Low6’s co-founder and CEO, Jamie Mitchell, also commented on the deal, praising Rivalry’s profound understanding of Millennial and Gen Z audiences. He said that this expertise perfectly aligns with Low6’s product development.</p>
<p>We’re confident our award-winning fantasy game will drive acquisition and engagement for Rivalry among a new audience while maintaining their commitment to innovation and one-of-a-kind experiences in betting. Jamie Mitchell, co-founder &amp; CEO, Low6</p>
<p>In September, Rivalry launched Cash &amp; Dash, an innovative casino game for next-gen bettors.</p>
