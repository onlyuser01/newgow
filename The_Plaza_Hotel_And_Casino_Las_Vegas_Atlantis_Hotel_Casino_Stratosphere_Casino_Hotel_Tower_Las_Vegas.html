    <h1>The Plaza Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Atlantis Hotel Casino Stratosphere Casino Hotel Tower Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group is launching with yet another operator in the Spanish market, bringing the total number of properties that GiG helps with its technology within the market to 14. The latest is Starcasino Group which is introducing its namesake brand to the market, and which will benefit from GiG’s localized expertise to provide players with the best possible experience in both casino and sportsbook operations.</p>
<p>Starcasino Breaks Ground in Spain with GiG</p>
<p>The partnership will allow Starcasino to expand in the highly competitive Spanish market which continues to grow in terms of new operators and suppliers despite the jurisdiction enforcing some of the toughest regulatory conditions on local operators.</p>
<p>GiG already generates more than €800 million or $834.7 million in gross gaming revenue in Spain, which is chiefly driven from interactive sports and casino options. Starcasino is similarly happy to expand in the market with GiG, benefiting from the tech provider’s clout in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, GiG managing director of Sportnco Hervé Schlosser said that he was pleased to see Starcasino choose his company to power the operator’s entry into the Spanish market, and said that the future held great things in store for both:</p>
<p>I am convinced that our combined sportsbook, platform technology and regulatory experience is well suited to help established operators like Starcasino power into new regulated markets. GiG managing director of Sportnco Hervé Schlosser</p>
<p>GiG is happy to attract a big brand such as Starcasino as it’s also one of the most respected brands in Belgium, which is the operator’s home market. Starcasino has been able to deliver on outstanding iGaming experiences elsewhere in Europe, making it likely to expect the same in Spain.</p>
<p>Starcasino country manager for Spain Alejandro Casanova also welcomed the opportunity and said that the agreement with GiG was an important milestone for the company as well. “After many years of work and success in Belgium we have initiated our expansion to other markets, in Spain we have selected GiG’s technologies to successfully face the challenges of this market,” he concluded, outlining a strong future for his brand in the country.</p>
