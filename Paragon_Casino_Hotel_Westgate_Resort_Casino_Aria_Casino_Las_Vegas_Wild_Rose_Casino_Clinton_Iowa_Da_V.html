    <h1>Paragon Casino Hotel Westgate Resort Casino Aria Casino Las Vegas Wild Rose Casino Clinton Iowa Da V</h1>

<p>The latest cabinets by Zitro have arrived at the renowned and world-class Casino Colón, owned by the Gran Madrid Group. The machines feature the new Double Link and Wheel of Legends multigame designed to engage players on physical casino gaming floors and elevate their experience.</p>
<p>New Zitro Cabinets Arrive in Casino Colón</p>
<p>While interactive gambling has become the norm, innovation in the land-based sector has not slowed down, with Zitro one of the most committed to developing new physical games and cabinets. This comes at a time when even Aristocrat is looking to expand its reach in the digital space.</p>
<p>But Zitro has remained through to its purpose. The Exclusive Illusion Glare cabinet comes with a curved and 43” Ultra HD screen. The name “double” is not chosen by chance either, as the cabinet has the ambition to double on all the features offered by previous versions, including a special bonus round and double the prizes.</p>
<p>Wheel of Legends, which comes as part of the Altius Glare cabinet, offers excellent graphic qualities and a brand new game called Dynamic which bucks the traditional gaming experience and takes it to the next level. Head of product for retail and online at Gran Madrid Group, Sergio Rupérez, has offered a laudatory statement for the new Glare cabinets:</p>
<p>Zitro’s wide variety of products allows us to renew our gaming offer with the latest in the market, as is the case of Double Link, which together with Wheel of Legends is having a great reception. Sergio Rupérez, head of product for retail and online, Gran Madrid Group</p>
<p>Products Designed to Innovate and Engage</p>
<p>Rupérez is confident that the new products will provide players with all they have been looking for. The Double Link and Wheel of Legends are bound to be a defining experience for many players at Casino Colón, the executive assured. The Glare Cabinet quality is also another reason why Rupérez feels this will be the case.</p>
<p>In fact, the executive has called the new games’ presentation “unbeatable” owing to the slick design and underpinning software and technology. Zitro director of casinos for Spain Jaime Aníbal-Alvarez thanked her colleague for the praise and said it was a privilege to be bringing the company’s latest and best product to date to the Gran Madrid Group and its properties.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make sure that players are satisfied and happy with what they get, and Zitro will make sure that this is indeed the case.</p>
