<p>William Hill makes a first bold step in Iowa</p>
<p>Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino becomes official partner</p>
<p>Iowa has no timeline for setting up its sports betting facilities</p>
<p>Iowa is preparing to enter the world of legal sports betting at a moment when the Department of Justice (DoJ) may be planning sweeping changes across the country. Nevertheless, the state’s operators are all geared up.</p>
<p>Iowa’s William Hill, Prairie Meadows Join Forces Ahead of Sports Betting Bill</p>
<p>On January 16, Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino has announced that it had signed a partnership with industry leader William Hill. The British operator has been expanding throughout the United States and its entry in Iowa is yet another successful step towards that goal.</p>
<p>The choice of partner is also well-considered, with Prairie Meadows providing visitors with access to 1,700 slot machines and table games, sprawling on the impressive 85,000 sq ft. The news was published on William Hill PLC’s website:</p>
<p>William Hill […] and Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino […] today announced an innovative partnership that makes William Hill the casino’s official sports book operator, should sports betting become legal under Iowa state law.</p>
<p>An Exciting Iowa Sports Betting Team</p>
<p>William Hill is making an effort to expand its footprint quickly, trying to overtake competitors in Iowa. With sports betting legislation still dithering in the state, Will Hill CEO Joe Asher had this to say in the official press statement:</p>
<p>We are excited about the prospect of sports betting in Iowa and are thrilled to partner with Prairie Meadows to be ready for the day when sports betting is legal in the state. We are building a first-class sports book that will make Prairie Meadows the place to bet and watch the games.</p>
<p>Prairie Meadows CEO Gary Palmer also commented on the opportunity, cited by Weareiowa.</p>
<p>According to Palmer, William Hill brings many years of experience and the company has established itself as a leader in sports betting operations. Mr. Palmer explained that the Altona horse racing track wanted to team up with knowledgeable &amp; experienced partner.</p>
<p>A Fever for Sports Betting</p>
<p>Sports betting has been a common topic these past few months. Kentucky, Michigan, and most recently New York have all been discussing the possibility of introducing and legalizing the activity in full. In the Empire State, Senator Joe Addabbo has pushed ahead with a bill, which will need endorsement.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the country, in places such as California, sports betting to be beyond the reach of local supporters and lawmakers alike. Despite the partnership, William Hill and Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino must await Iowa to formally legalize its industry.</p>
