<p>Thank you for your reply, barrymcdowall7. Unfortunately, if you are sure you didn't make the transaction yourself, it is most likely that someone stole your payment information. I completely understand your frustration and disappointment in this situation, however, please note that this is in no way the casino's mistake. It would be close to impossible to prove that it was in fact someone else who created the account and deposited using your credit card, therefore we cannot penalize the casino as they did nothing wrong. I am afraid that the issue regarding stolen identity and/or funds is for the local police department and not us. Therefore, I would suggest that you report this to the police and contact your bank to protect yourself from further loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to close this complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
