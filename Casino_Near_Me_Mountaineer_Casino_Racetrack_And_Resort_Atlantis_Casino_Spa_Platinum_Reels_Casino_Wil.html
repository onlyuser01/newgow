    <h1>Casino Near Me Mountaineer Casino Racetrack And Resort Atlantis Casino Spa Platinum Reels Casino Wil</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>thank you for the message. I initially contacted the online support on the website because I could no longer log in. Without warning, without email or any other message. When I try to log on to the website the following appears: Login failed! System error!</p>
<p>Support told me that my account was suspected of money laundering. I asked how you would come up with it and I was told to email them. I already did this on February 17th, 2020 and received the following answer:</p>
<p>"Dear Erik,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting our casino.</p>
<p>I hope you find this email as you wish.</p>
<p>Regarding your last email, we would like to inform you that your account is under investigation. You will be informed by email as soon as the process is complete. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact us, we are available around the clock, have a nice day;</p>
<p>Sincerely yours;</p>

<p>A few days later I received a new email with the invitation for further deposit bonuses etc. ... I then reported again why I would get something like this but I could not log into my account and my payments were pending. (Multiple payouts are open)</p>
<p>The site attracts customers with several bonuses. I verified myself on the site just like other providers and they stole my data and my money! Since someone apologized that I still get advertising, no one has answered my request.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Erik L.</p>
