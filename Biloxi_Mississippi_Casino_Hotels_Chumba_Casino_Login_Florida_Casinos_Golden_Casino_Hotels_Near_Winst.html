    <h1>Biloxi Mississippi Casino Hotels Chumba Casino Login Florida Casinos Golden Casino Hotels Near Winst</h1>

<p>On 4-29-2023 I received an email from crashino@crashino.com containing a promotion. The email stated, " Crashino. 20 MEGA SPINS. Get these amazing Mega Spins right away!</p>
<p>Sweeten up your life with this amazing offer of 20 Mega Spins with 0 wagering requirement on Sweet Bonanza! Play with 1$ worth per spin only in the next 24 hours only. How to get this bonus?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a deposit over 20$ 2. Go to the bonuses section and claim your bonus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Sweet Bonanza to play your free spins. This offer is valid only in the next 24 hours, claim it before it expires!"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So later on in the day I deposited (first time depositing there) $23.58. at the time my deposit was received I was still well under the 24 hour expiration time frame. I checked my account and there was nothing in the bonus tab. after talking with live chat rep i was told "i'm very sorry for the caused inconvenience however i have made sure that your concern has been prioritized to be checked as soon as possible" over the next 12 hours i contacted them 4-5 times and was told the same, "i'm very sorry for the caused inconvenience however i have made sure that your concern has been prioritized to be checked as soon as possible", every time with no other explanation. i was told multiple times i could not speak to a manager, chat reps only. also i requested a chat transcript at the end of every chat and was told they would get emailed to me, which none of them did. the final chat i had with them i requested all chat transcripts and the conversation i copied and pasted. "10:26 name: David</p>
<p>Every conversation i have had with yall over the last 11 hours has been marked for yall to send me the transcript. i have received none of them. i need you to send me the transcripts to those chats, and this one.</p>
<p>10:27 Mark</p>
<p>Hello. Thank you for contacting me. How may I help you?</p>
<p>10:27 David</p>
<p>Every conversation i have had with yall over the last 11 hours has been marked for yall to send me the transcript. i have received none of them. i need you to send me the transcripts to those chats, and this one.</p>
<p>10:28 Mark</p>
<p>If you wish to get the transcript just after the end of the chat press on the send me a transcript button and it will be automatically send to you via Email.</p>
<p>10:29 David</p>
<p>no i have done that for every single chat and it has not worked</p>
<p>so, i need those transcripts</p>
<p>10:33 Mark</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting and I'm very sorry for the caused inconvenience however i have made sure that your concern has been prioritized to be checked as soon as possible. Please make sure that you're correctly pressing on send me a transcript button.</p>
<p>10:33 David</p>
<p>that's what yall said about the free spins you lied about giving me</p>
<p>10:35 David</p>
<p>its been 11 hours with zero evidence anything is being done about that so i assume since im getting the exact same response about the transcripts, i will never see those either....is that correct?</p>
<p>10:36 Mark</p>
<p>I'm very sorry and you have my sincere apologies for the inconvenience i can assure you that i have forwarded your concern once more to be checked faster." Mark ended the chat immediately after sending that last message.</p>
<p>What i am disputing it that the only reason i deposited there in the first place was because of the email promotion i received. which now it appears i was lured there and tricked into depositing by the false promotion that i never received. The promotion was for 20 free spins with no wager requirement, as good as cash. i feel like that they owe me 20 free spins valued the same as the promotion offered under the same terms that they offered in the email i received. if they are not willing to do that then they should reimburse my deposit .</p>
