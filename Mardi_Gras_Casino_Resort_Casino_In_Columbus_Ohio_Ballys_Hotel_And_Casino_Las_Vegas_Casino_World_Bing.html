<p>The fast-growing multi-award-winning global sports betting and iGaming supplier, FSB Technology, announced a new senior-level appointment. The company confirmed Friday it hired the services of the seasoned financial industry veteran, Craig Artley. Joining the C-suite at FSB, he was appointed to the important role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO).</p>
<p>As CFO, Artley will oversee FSB's financial strategy. He will be in charge and lead its compliance, as well as financial teams. Moreover, the recently appointed executive will provide strategic advice and guide existing and new partnerships. Ultimately, Artley's efforts are expected to play a key role in FSB's future growth and its expansion on a global scale.</p>
<p>In a statement released by the company, Artley shared his excitement. "FSB’s transformation into a leading global sportsbook supplier has been inspiring to follow from within the industry, so to be offered the opportunity to join this journey is a great honor," he explained. Last but not least, Artley said: "My job now is to support the business from a financial view across our four operational continents and growing partner pool as we look forward to a busy 2024."</p>
<p>Adam Smith, FSB's Chief Executive Officer, was similarly thrilled with the latest senior-level hire. He spoke about Artley, explaining that he is a perfect fit for the company's growing senior leadership team. "As we continue to build our partner network across multiple continents, it was clear we needed a dynamic figure to deliver a robust, holistic economic strategy to support the overall ecosystem of our global business," added Smith. Last but not least, FSB's Chief Executive pointed out: "With Craig’s sector experience and infectious desire to deliver he was the clear choice to fill this role and we're thrilled to have him on board."</p>
<p>The company's latest senior-level appointment comes during a productive period. Earlier this year, FSB entered into the regulated gambling market in Ontario with its long-term partner, Fitzdares. Additionally, the company grew its global footprint with expansion into the African region.</p>
<p>Before joining FSB, Artley held senior-level roles with Sporting Group. Overall, he was a part of the company for more than three and a half years and during that time held key positions, allowing him to accumulate significant experience. Outside of Sporting Group, Artley grew its corporate finance expertise holding important roles at Gfinity, the leading gaming media and technology company. Throughout his professional career, he was also part of Deloitte.</p>
