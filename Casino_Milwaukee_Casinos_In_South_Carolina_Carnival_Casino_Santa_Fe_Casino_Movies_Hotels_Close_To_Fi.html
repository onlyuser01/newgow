<p>Richardson sustained a shoulder injury in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans in an AFC South divisional game. He was tackled during a run play, and landed on his right shoulder after he was slammed to the turf at Lucas Oil Stadium.</p>
<p>Richardson pointed to his shoulder when medical staff rushed to the field to attend to him. Cameras caught him walking to the locker room in obvious pain. Initial X-rays were negative.</p>
<p>Backup quarterback Gardener Minshew entered the game late in the second half. He completed 14-of-22 passes for 155 yards off the bench, and helped lead the Colts to a 23-16 comeback victory over the Titans.</p>
<p>The Colts improved to 3-2 on the season, and are currently tied for first place in the AFC South with the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>The Colts selected Richardson with the fourth-overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. He earned the starting quarterback job early in the preseason over Minshew.</p>
<p>Another Injury for Richardson</p>
<p>Richardson underwent additional testing on Monday, which revealed an AC joint injury on his right shoulder. He has a grade three sprain and is currently seeking a second opinion.</p>
<p>Dr. Keith Meister, a shoulder specialist, will examine Richardson and determine if he requires surgery. Richardson could miss up to a month until his shoulder injury heals, and possibly more time if he undergoes surgery.</p>
<p>The Colts listed Richardson as out for Week 6’s game against the Jaguars in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>Richardson exited three games this season with an injury. In Week 1 against the Jaguars, Richardson made his pro debut. He banged his knee late in the fourth quarter and did not finish the game. In Week 2, Richardson sustained a concussion in a divisional game against the Houston Texans and Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite C.J. Stroud.</p>
<p>Richardson missed Week 3 because he did not clear concussion protocol, so Minshew started against the Baltimore Ravens. In Week 4, Richardson played a full game against the Los Angeles Rams without any injuries.</p>
<p>Against the Titans in Week 5, Richardson suffered an injury in the second quarter before he was pulled from a third game this season.</p>
<p>In four games this season, Richardson completed 59.5% of his passes for 577 yards and three touchdowns. He threw one interception and was sacked seven times.</p>
<p>Richardson displayed his skills as a mobile quarterback by scoring four rushing touchdowns. He rushed 25 times this season for 136 yards.</p>
<p>Richardson’s best game this season occurred in a 29-23 overtime loss against the Rams in Week 4. He passed for 200 yards and two touchdowns, while adding 56 rushing yards and an additional touchdown on 10 carries.</p>
<p>Betting the Colts, Minshew 1-0 ATS This Season</p>
<p>In one official start this season, the Colts are 1-0 with Minshew under center. Minshew led the Colts to a 22-19 upset against the Ravens in Baltimore in Week 3. He completed 68.7% of his passes this season for 533 yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Minshew is expected to start for the Colts in Week 6 against his former club. He has a 9-16 career record as a starter, including 7-13 as a starter in 20 games with the Jaguars.</p>
<p>The Colts are currently +4 road under dogs against the Jaguars. The Colts and Jaguars both have a 3-2 record against the point spread this season.</p>
<p>In the season opener in Week 1, the Colts were a +3.5 home dog against the Jaguars. The Colts blew a 21-17 lead in the fourth quarter and lost, 31-21.</p>
<p>The Jaguars return home after playing two games in London during the last two weeks. They won both games, including a huge win against the Buffalo Bills in Week 5.</p>
<p>The Colts currently have a win total of 7.5 over/under. The Colts are +200 odds to make the playoffs, and -250 odds to miss the postseason, according to DraftKings.</p>
<p>The Jaguars and Colts are tied for first place in the AFC South. The Jaguars are -105 odds to win the division, and the Colts are +400 odds.</p>
<p>The Colts opened this season at +15000 odds to win Super Bowl LVIII. They saw a slight uptick in the futures since the season began, and they’re now +13000 odds to win the Super Bowl. They’re also a long shot to win the AFC Championship at +6000 odds.</p>
