<p>Commenting on the matter, LeBron James said: “Football season just got A LOT more fun. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Basketball powerhouse LeBron James is joining DraftKings’ team as a talent ambassador, the American betting operator announced. While best known for his basketball prowess, King James’ partnership with the gambling juggernaut will actually be centered on football.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the multi-year agreement will see the Los Angeles Lakers star participate in a variety of football activations centered on select key tentpole events. This latest football venture will see James, who is prohibited from discussing the NBA under the terms of his agreement, leverage his understanding of the professional sports sector as a whole.</p>
<p>James is, admittedly, no stranger to football himself. Prior to his foray into the world of professional basketball, the King played football for two years for St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>A Union of the Crowns</p>
<p>LeBron James commented on his new venture on X, where he shared a promotional photo of himself under DraftKings’ signature crown. Using emoji, he implied that this is a partnership between kings and added:</p>
<p>Football season just got A LOT more fun. Let’s go! LeBron James</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jason Robins, DraftKings’ board chair, welcomed the basketball star to the DraftKings family. Robins lauded King James as “one of the most influential athletes of all time” and said that the current deal is an “absolute honor and privilege” for his team.</p>
<p>Robins added that he cannot wait to work with such an outstanding athlete who reflects the operator’s love for sports.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with a passionate sports fan who shares the same competitive mindset that echoes throughout the walls at DraftKings, while delivering exciting engagement opportunities to our customers and his loyal fanbase for years to come. Jason Robins, chair, DraftKings</p>
