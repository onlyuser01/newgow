<p>The global gaming technology and mobile games publisher, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, announced it plans to extend its C-suite via a new nomination for a Non-Executive Director. On Tuesday, the company confirmed it has nominated the expert with more than two decades of experience in delivering, developing and operating infrastructure assets, Jennifer Aument.</p>
<p>Aristocrat confirmed that her nomination as a Non-Executive Director of the company is effective as of April 11, 2023, but remains subject to receipt of the relevant regulatory pre-approvals. Prior to all regulatory pre-approvals, "Aument will be referred to as a Director (Elect)," explains a statement released by Aristocrat. Once the necessary approvals are met, Aristocrat's Board will officially confirm the appointment of Aument as Director.</p>
<p>Neil Chatfield, Aristocrat's Chairman, shared his excitement in a statement saying: "I am delighted that Jennifer has agreed to join the Aristocrat board." He pointed out that Aument has significant experience and understanding of the complex Australian and US environments. Additionally, Chatfield pointed out that she is a proven leader and has experience in overseeing major projects.</p>
<p>He added: "Jennifer also brings strong government relations and public affairs capabilities. Jennifer is an impressive, people-oriented business leader, with a track record of active community engagement." Last but not least, Chatfield pointed out: "I am pleased to welcome Jennifer to Aristocrat and look forward to her contribution to our ongoing success."</p>
<p>Overall, Aument has more than 25 years of experience within large-scale Australian and US publicly listed companies related to infrastructure. Throughout her career, she has accumulated experience in managing and operating large infrastructure assets.</p>
<p>Most recently, Aument was a part of the global premier infrastructure consulting firm, AECOM. She served as a Global Transportation Chief Executive and in that role, she was in charge of a team with more than 14,000 members. Her professional background also includes a leadership-level position with Transurban's North American business where she served as President and Chief Executive Officer for nearly 10 years.</p>
<p>Aument is currently a part of different advisory boards such as the Eno Center for Transportation and Cornell University. She also held a strategic role with the Board of Commissioners for the Virginia Port Authority. Currently, Aument resides in Virginia, the US.</p>
<p>The recent nomination comes after Aristocrat Gaming and Inspired Entertainment forged a new partnership. The deal saw the duo join forces to deliver advanced virtual sports solutions.</p>
