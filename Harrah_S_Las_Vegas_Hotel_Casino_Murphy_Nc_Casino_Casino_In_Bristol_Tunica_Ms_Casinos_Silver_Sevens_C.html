<p>In the early hours of Friday, Kanye West went on another of his now trademark antisemitic rants. In this one, the formerly respected hip-hop musician raved about Adolf Hitler, Donald Trump, and his former business partners.</p>

<p>“It’s 60 million of us in America, 60 million Jews in the world!” he falsely screamed in a video circulating on social media. West also claimed that Zionist Jews own all the banks, hospitals, and private schools in L.A.</p>
<p>“Who’s going to make the hospitals, though? He’s a Zionist, Trump. This is what I’ve been trying to tell you. Jesus Christ, Hitler, Ye, third party, sponsor that shit.”</p>
<p>A group of West’s “friends” egged on every “point” the spiraling rapper made, appearing to value staying in his orbit more than correcting or helping him.</p>
<p>According to tabloid reports, the 10-minute explosion took place in his suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas, where West and the hangers-on retreated after Vegas police shut down a $2K-a-ticket party.</p>

<p>Vulture Release</p>
<p>The party, thrown by West with rapper Ty Dolla $ign, was held to preview material from West’s new album, “Vultures,” which has already missed its scheduled release date.</p>
<p>However, it was held at a Vegas warehouse without a proper permit.</p>
<p>As a crowd that included North — West’s 10-year-old daughter with Kim Kardashian – watched, West sampled lyrics from the album: “I still keep some Jews with me. Management? Nah. I only let ’em do my jewelry.”</p>
<p>West v. Kardashian</p>
<p>West and Kardashian — who have four children together — finalized their divorce in November 2022.</p>
<p>West, 46, was blacklisted by the music industry last year for similar comments. He claims he was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2018.</p>
<p>He and Bianca Censori, his Australian model wife, were seen outside the Four Seasons Hotel hours later, standing with their luggage while waiting for a car to pick them up.</p>
