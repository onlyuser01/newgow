<p>discuss whether the Los Angeles Rams are suffering from the ‚Äúchampionship hangover.‚Äù They weren‚Äôt great in the season opener, but they‚Äôve had plenty of time to analyze their performance and prepare for Week 2, when they welcome the Atlanta Falcons at SoFi Stadium.</p>
<p>This is going to be the first time the Falcons are playing at the Rams‚Äô new stadium. They did, however, do well at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is the venue the Rams used for the first five years after coming back to LA.</p>
<p>The Falcons did beat the Rams in both of their previous two games in California, but oddsmakers expect the result to be different this time. They think the Rams are going to rip the Falcons apart on Sunday.</p>

<p>Morale is Low in Atlanta Falcons‚Äô Locker Room</p>
<p>The Falcons must feel disappointed after a victory slipped right through their hands in Week 1. They were 26-10 ahead of the fourth period in the game against the New Orleans Saints, but they gambled away the lead, losing 27-26 in the end.</p>
<p>Since 2020, only five times has a team blown a 15 point lead in the fourth quarter and lost. Three of them were the Falcons üò¨ #DirtyBirds #Saints #NFL pic.twitter.com/Sgly7uuxRb ‚Äî Eric Mintzer (@MintSports) September 12, 2022</p>
<p>In the first three quarters, however, the Falcons show the world they could be a fantastic team. Their quarterback Marcus Mariota threw for 215 yards and one touchdown, while also gaining 72 yards for his team. Speaking of rushing, Cordarrelle Patterson recorded 120 yards, while also scoring one touchdown.</p>
<p>These two are likely to be the men in the spotlight in Sunday‚Äôs game. The big question is whether the Rams‚Äô defense can stop them.</p>
<p>Matt Stafford Needs to Up His Game</p>
<p>We have faith in the Rams‚Äô defense. They should be able to handle whatever Mariota, Patterson, and the rest throw at them. After all, LA‚Äôs defensive team did put an okay performance against an offensive powerhouse that is Buffalo in Week 1. They even forced four turnovers in the Bills game.</p>
<p>The Rams defense will do well in Week 2, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. But what about their offense? They weren‚Äôt great in the season opener, with QB Matt Stafford getting picked three times and throwing for only one touchdown.</p>
<p>We expect him to do better this time. He did have some problems with his elbow, which may explain why he didn‚Äôt perform well against the Bills. However, ten days after the game, he should feel better.</p>
<p>Apart from doing better in the passing game, we also expect the Rams to improve their running stats. In Week 1, their rushing was horrendous. This time, they need to do much, much better.</p>
<p>Falcons vs Rams Prediction</p>
<p>The Rams are a much better team than the Falcons and they have the motivation to grab a big win. Although the Falcons do have some decent players on the roster, we don‚Äôt expect to see much from them on Sunday.Picks: Los Angeles Rams to win and cover the spread</p>
