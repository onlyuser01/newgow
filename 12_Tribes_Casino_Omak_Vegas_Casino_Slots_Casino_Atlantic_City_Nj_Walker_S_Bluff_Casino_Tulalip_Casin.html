<p>Ainsworth Game Technology, a leading gaming solutions supplier, has strengthened its financial team with the promotion of Lynn Mah. The latter will serve the renowned provider as its new chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Mah to Replace Ludski as CFO</p>
<p>Lynn Mah’s tenure at Ainsworth will officially begin at the beginning of the next year. Starting January 1, Mah will assume office as the company’s new chief financial officer. She will succeed Mark Ludski, who has served in this position for over two decades.</p>
<p>Both Mah and Ludski are long-time Ainsworth Game Technology members who have long years of experience with the company. Mah joined Ainsworth in 2007 and worked as its group finance manager prior to her current promotion.</p>
<p>Ludski, on the other hand, has occupied the CFO seat since 2000 and has been with the company through most of its existence. He will remain within the company and will serve as a secretary while helping for a smooth transition of the CFO role. As a secretary, Ludski will also help Ainsworth Game Technology on other fronts and will continue working for the company’s future.</p>
<p>Gladstone Believes Mah Is Well-Suited for the Role</p>
<p>Danny Gladstone, Ainsworth Game Technology’s chairman, congratulated Lynn Mah on her promotion and welcomed her as a chief financial officer. He noted that the entire team trusts her skills and expertise and believes she will be able to bring much value to the company. Gladstone lauded Mah as a skilled finance worker with a skill set that will support Ainsworth’s growth.</p>
<p>She is a highly competent and effective finance executive, and her skills are well suited to the opportunities ahead. We look forward to working with her in her expanded role. Danny Gladstone, chair, Ainsworth Game Technology</p>
<p>Gladstone also addressed Ludski and thanked him for his exceptional service. The chairman added that he is relieved that the incumbent CFO will remain a part of Ainsworth even after Mah replaces him in 2023.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Board I would also like to thank Mark and pay tribute to his significant and valuable contribution to Ainsworth over the last twenty-two years. We are delighted to retain his expertise and experience and look forward to continuing to work with him. Danny Gladstone, chair, Ainsworth Game Technology</p>
<p>Ainsworth Game Technology is a publicly listed company headquartered in Newington, Sydney, Australia. The company currently operates across several continents, including Australia, Europe, NA and LATAM. In March, Ainsworth successfully launched its online slots with Cordish Live in Pennsylvania.</p>
