<p>Los Angeles Chargers vs San Francisco 49ers is one of the most exciting matchups of Week 10 of the 2022 NFL. The Chargers are traveling to northern California without a couple of their key offensive players, which could the decisive factor in Sunday’s game. At least, that’s what oddsmakers think, who are giving the role of a huge favorite to the Niners. The hosts are seen as a 7-point favorite in the Week 10 clash.</p>

<p>The Chargers’ Problems on the Receiving End</p>
<p>Five of the six Chargers’ leaders in receiving yards are currently on the injury list. WR Mike Williams is definitely out, and so is Keenan Allen. DeAndre Carter is listed as questionable, while Josh Palmer has only recently returned to practice.</p>
<p>Further, running back Austin Ekeler – the man with the most receiving and rushing TDs – is also not at 100% fitness after suffering an abdomen injury. He will play, but we doubt he’s going to be able to do much on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sure, he’s a fantastic player even when not in top shape. However, he’s likely to struggle against such a good defense as the one of the Niners.</p>
<p>The Niners Going for Their Fifth Win of the Season</p>
<p>San Francisco is competing in one of the toughest divisions in the league. They’re currently in second place in the NFC West Division with two wins fewer than the Seattle Seahawks. The Niners are 4-4 right now, but they have a good chance to get to the top of the divisional table.</p>
<p>The bad news is that their schedule for the remainder of the regular season looks very ugly. Not only do they have to play against the Chargers this coming Sunday, but they also have to play against such heavyweights as the Cardinals, Saints, Dolphins, Buccaneers, Seahawks, and so on.</p>
<p>The good news for the Niners is that they have some amazing players on the roster. This team is so strong in 2022 that oddsmakers are giving such short odds as -500 on the Niners making the playoffs.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers vs San Francisco 49ers Predictions</p>
<p>The 49ers are winning the Week 10 game, there’s no doubt about it. The only question here is whether they can cover the 7-point spread. We don’t think so. The Chargers do have problems with injuries, but they do have enough manpower to avoid a blowout loss.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win but not cover the spread; under to hit</p>
