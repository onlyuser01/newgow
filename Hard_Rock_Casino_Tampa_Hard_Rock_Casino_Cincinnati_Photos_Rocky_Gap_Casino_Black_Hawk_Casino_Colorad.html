    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Tampa Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Photos Rocky Gap Casino Black Hawk Casino Colorad</h1>

<p>I Played with Black Lotus Casino for some time now and I recently started having issues with them once i started withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>I made multiple withdraws for different amounts on different days to be able to differ one withdraw from another as ive dealt with online casinos attempting to claim the funds were already sent. The withdraw im refering to in this complaint is for $1900.00 B119943155 made 4-16-2022 @10:52 PM.(included account screenshots and email verification) I waited a week to finally hear anything about it but it was my account info that showed me they weren't wanting to pay this withdraw as it was reversed 4-19-2022 @3:20AM B119989411 +$1900.00 back to my account, and on 4-19-2022 @3:20AM an Operator Adjustment of -$1900.00 from my account. (screenshots included) When i wrote into customer service they told me the reverse was due to using bonuses without making a deposit in between. I thought it was unusual as they dont give many without deposting bonuses. I checked back at my screenshots i made and it told me different from their explanation. It just so happens i didnt use any bonuses at all that day. I made 3 deposits throughout the course of the day and each show no bonuses attached from 2 AM to the time of the withdraw made for $1900.00.(Included screenshots)</p>
<p>First deposit 4-16-2022 @ 2:03AM B119923655 +$20.00 which gave my account $20.03, $0.03 was the remaining amount before deposit.</p>
<p>Second Deposit 4-16-2022 @ 5:52 PM B119937539 +$20.00 which gave my account $24.43, $4.43 was the remaining amount before deposit.</p>
<p>Third deposit 4-16-2022 @ 6:23 PM B119938055 +$50.00 which gave my account $72.78, $22.78 was the remaining amount before deposit.</p>
<p>I dont like being lied to or in fact having $1900.00 stole from me based off of lies. they didnt tell me about me not going to get the $1900.00 until weeks later. I just so happened to see the transactions they made and screenshotted it JUST IN CASE. Although here we are. Im HIGHLY UPSET AS THEY CONTINUE TO LIE EVEN THOUGH IVE TOLD THEM TIME AFTER TIME I HAVE THE INFORMATION STATING OTHERWISE. They wont pay me the $1900.00 still.</p>
