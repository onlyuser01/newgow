<p>The deal with FeniBet is but the latest in a string of content agreements Stakelogic has been securing with operators around Europe</p>
<p>Casino content house Stakelogic has minted a new agreement with FeniBet, a startup iGaming operator in Latvia. Under the agreement, the supplier will provide the Latvian company with a selection of casino content.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s games are famous for their lighthearted fruit themes, which give them a familiar vibe. At the same time, the titles incorporate some innovative engagement features that boost player engagement and help players increase their chances for big rewards. One such mechanic is the famous Super Stake feature that is available across many of Stakelogic’s games.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is also popular for the quality of the content it provides. Its titles excel in terms of graphics, sound design, gameplay and bonuses to provide players with unforgettable gambling experiences.</p>
<p>FeniBet will secure access to some of Stakelogic’s critically-acclaimed hits, such as Buzz, El Cowboy Megaways and Devil’s Trap. It will also be able to offer the supplier’s newly-launched Diamond Staxx Multipays game.</p>
<p>The deal with FeniBet will expand Stakelogic’s position in the Latvian iGaming market and will, at the same time, reinforce the operator’s offering. Thanks to the agreement, FeniBet will be able to quickly grow its portfolio and channel more customers toward its platform.</p>
<p>FeniBet’s head of IT, Martins Opmanis, commented on the agreement, noting that Stakelogic’s content is quickly gaining traction. By adopting its hits, FeniBet will be able to provide its customers with a variety of new titles. Opmanis is most excited about introducing the Super Stake feature to its players.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is rapidly gaining popularity, and we want our customers to enjoy its classic and modern video slots. We look forward to introducing Stakelogic flagship Super Stake feature to elevate our players’ experience on FeniBet. Martins Opmanis, head of IT, FeniBet</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Danila Dzehs, Stakelogic’s senior sales manager, lauded FeniBet as a top-tier operator in Latvia. Dzehs pointed out that the new deal will expand Stakelogic’s global footprint while elevating gaming experiences for Latvian customers.</p>
<p>FeniBet is a top-tier operator in Latvia and this partnership further establishes Stakelogic as a leading content provider. Our games are proven in Latvia and will allow the operator to elevate the experience it offers to players. Danila Dzehs, senior sales manager, FeniBet</p>
<p>The deal with FeniBet is but the latest in a string of content deals. Stakelogic just penned another deal with Fonbet, agreeing to supply content in Greece. Prior to that, the content house entered Belgium thanks to an agreement with PepperMill Casino. In Early March, the company also consolidated its presence in the Dutch market via an arrangement with 711.</p>
