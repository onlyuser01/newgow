    <h1>Casino Royal Offers Casinos In Rhode Island Hollywood Casino In Joliet Rainbow Hotel Casino Aquarius</h1>

<p>Hello, makdi,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience. I will contact the casino and try my best to resolve the issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, while we will wait for the casino's response, can you please:</p>
<p>Provide me with the information on which e-wallet/app you use for your crypto BTC.</p>
<p>Contact the casino as they recommended you via email, and provide them with the requested document; however, it could be a photo, so I recommend taking a photo of the requested data (maybe you will be able to take a photo of that without the sensitive data if it is possible to scroll the screen to a correct position) and only to cover up a part of the key you mentioned above - if it is a photo, the casino should be able to verify the correctness of e-wallet address and your personal data and see that nothing else was edited on the photo.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if it does not work, let's then only wait for the casino's response and further details, or simply provide them with the requested (the casino should respect your privacy and comply with their Privacy Policy, so it is impossible that the casino would share anything with any 3rd party).</p>
<p>Now I would like to invite Miami Club Casino's representative to join this conversation and participate in the resolution of this complaint.</p>
<p>Dear Miami Club Casino team,</p>
<p>Could you please provide us with further details regarding the player's situation? What steps should the player take to withdraw his winnings?</p>
<p>Can you provide him with detailed instructions on how to proceed to complete the KYC/verification and what documents are accepted by the casino for payment method verification purposes?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for providing the information.</p>
