    <h1>Casino Resort Near Me Mgm Casino Hotel Paragon Casino Ozwin Casino No Deposit Bonus Best Casino Onli</h1>

<p>The leading developer of games for the online gambling industry, Kalamba Games, continues to expand its portfolio of engaging titles. The company confirmed in a statement on Wednesday it launched a new nature-themed slot, packed with engaging and rewarding features, called Blazing Spirit Hold and Win.</p>
<p>The name of the recent slot game suggests that it incorporates the popular Hold and Win mechanic. However, the slot game offers even more features that grant a chance for big prizes and bring thrilling experiences.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games' new 5x3 reel slot features an RTP of 96,62% and 25 paylines. The thrilling game takes the players on an adventure to the wilderness and the reel is presented at the center of the screen. Quality sound effects and animations elevate the excitement of the new slot that incorporates symbols including horses, eagles and owls, perfectly matching its animal theme.</p>
<p>Alex Cohen, Kalamba Games' COO and Co-Founder shared his excitement about the recently released slot game. "Blazing Spirit Hold and Win boasts a popular theme and a way to align the gameplay with player preferences, allowing them to raise their stake for an increased chance at landing the bonus," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, Cohen pointed out: "With two different bonuses available and the ability to win one of these whilst already playing through a thrilling free spin round, itâ€™s a game is full of surprises, and we are confident its fiery nature will keep players engaged."</p>
<p>Players of Blazing Spirit Hold and Win can benefit from Wolf wild symbols that can substitute all base game symbols. To further elevate the thrill and engagement, the game also offers Cashpots that bring instant prizes. Each Cashpot has a different prize attached to them and players need to land four or five during the base game to secure a cumulative prize.</p>
<p>To secure free spins, players need to land at least three scatters. Once this happens, they are granted 10 free spins. While the free spins bonus round is ongoing, scatters award an extra free spin and at the same time remove low-paying symbols, granting a chance for big wins. Moreover, during free spins, players can also activate the Hold and Win bonus.</p>
<p>Players of the new slot game from Kalamba Games that land six or more Cashpots during the base game can trigger the Hold and Win bonus. This engaging functionality gives them three respins, while every additional Cashpot that lands during those spins retriggers them.</p>
