<p>The supplier of online and mobile games, catering to the growing online gambling sector, Push Gaming, expanded its portfolio of games with a fresh new addition. Earlier this week, the company released details regarding its newest slot game, Fish 'n' Nudge. Considering the name of the game, it's no surprise that it features a fishing theme. However, Fish 'n' Nudge comes packed with engaging and rewarding features, perfectly fusing a classic feel with modern functionality.</p>
<p>This 5x4 reel slot game from Push Gaming offers medium volatility, variable RTPs such as 96.40% or 94.38% and a maximum win of 10,000x. The engaging slot uses symbols that match its distinct fishing theme such as lures, reels and rods, among others.</p>
<p>Bringing thrilling and rewarding features, Fish 'n' Nudge is the perfect addition to the growing portfolio of Push Gaming. The recently released slot game follows other hit titles from the company, such as Razor Returns, Rat King and Goat Getter.</p>
<p>Craig Turner, Push Gaming's Senior Game Producer, was excited about the newest addition to the company's growing portfolio. "Fish 'n' Nudge is a versatile slot that offers players multiple ways to win in the base game, with net symbols adding a transformative element to the already exciting gameplay," he explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Moreover, Turner pointed out: "The ability for the free spins round to spin infinitely, as long as there are nets on the reels, simultaneously increases the multiplier and provides more opportunities to win resulting in an escalation of excitement for players." In conclusion, Push Gaming's Senior Game Producer said that the company is looking forward to seeing players enjoy its latest game.</p>
<p>Players of Fish 'n' Nudge can land a net overlay during any spin. This appears as a stack of four vertical symbols that "nudge down one row for each subsequent spin before leaving the gameboard," explains Push Gaming.</p>
<p>To trigger free spins, players online need to land at least three scatters. Once this happens, a special free spins round is initiated. Lucky players who land scatter symbols during the free spins round can benefit from further prizes by increasing a multiplier.</p>
<p>The release of the new slot game comes after Push Gaming recently expanded in the Netherlands via a partnership with JOI Gaming's JACKS casino brand. Under the terms of that deal, the provider of online casino games agreed to supply content, powering the operator's offering for Dutch customers.</p>
