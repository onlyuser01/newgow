<p>Global payments technology company, Nuvei Corporation, announced two new appointments late last week. The company said Friday that it appointed two new independent directors. DraftKings' former Chief Financial and Chief Compliance Officer, Tim Dent, as well as Meta Platforms Regional Vice President, Maren Lau, were both appointed as independent directors.</p>
<p>In a statement released on August 5, 2022, Nuvei's Chair and CEO, Philip Fayer, said: "Both Maren and Tim are proven leaders who bring extensive knowledge and experience that is beneficial to our business and highly relevant to our growing industry verticals and geographies." He deemed the duo as outstanding additions to the company's Board. In conclusion, Fayer said that the company is looking forward to the success the new collaboration with Dent and Lau will bring.</p>
<p>Overall, Dent has more than 20 years of experience within the online gaming industry. Most recently, he served as Chief Financial and Chief Compliance Officer at DraftKings. While a part of the leading US sportsbook, he spearheaded risk management, as well as legal and legislative departments.</p>
<p>Before becoming a part of DraftKings, Dent also held several leadership roles as a part of Everest Gaming. The company was a leading European poker and casino operator. As a part of Everest, Dent helped boost its growth from a start-up company to a leading regulated operator.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lau is currently a Vice President at Meta for Latin America. Besides helping the business in its long-term growth for the region, she also prepares its transition for the next level of social connection, the metaverse. Before joining Meta, Lau was CMO and a founding partner at IMS, a digital marketing company.</p>
<p>According to Nuvei, Lau's recent appointment reaffirms the company's ongoing gender diversity strategy. Having Lau join the company's board boosts its efforts for female representation of 30% by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2003, Nuvei is currently a leading global payments platform. The company offers flexible and scalable solutions that help companies with next-gen payments and payout options.</p>
<p>Currently, Nuvei helps connect businesses with their customers in more than 200 markets globally. The company supports more than 550 alternative payment methods, including cryptocurrencies, as well as 150 currencies. With its high-scaling technology, Nuvei can help businesses grow both locally and globally via a single integration.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company announced a new collaboration with the fast-growing hospitality brand, Selina. Under the collaboration, the brand selected Nuvei as its payments provider for Europe and Israel. What's more, Selina plans to further extend its collaboration with Nuvei to cover territories such as Australia, the United States and Latin America soon.</p>
