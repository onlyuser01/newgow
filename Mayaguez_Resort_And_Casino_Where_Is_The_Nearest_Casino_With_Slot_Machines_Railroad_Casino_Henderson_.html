    <h1>Mayaguez Resort And Casino Where Is The Nearest Casino With Slot Machines Railroad Casino Henderson</h1>

<p>The gambling regulator in Indiana, the Indiana Gaming Commission, released its latest report, revealing details regarding the performance of sports betting operators for the month of September. The recent report reveals that the betting handle posted by regulated betting operators last month hit $404.1 million, marking a year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>A comparison to the $382.5 million in betting handle posted a year earlier, in September 2022, shows that this year, the handle increased by nearly 6%. On the other hand, when compared to the $355.4 million betting handle result reported in September 2021, an increase of 13.7% is observed, reaffirming an ongoing growth trajectory.</p>
<p>Considering the $404.1 million in betting handle reported last month, taxable sports wagering adjusted gross revenue (AGR), halted at $41.1 million. A year-over-year comparison to the corresponding period last year shows that while the betting handle was lower, taxable AGR was higher. In September 2022, taxable AGR reported by regulated sports betting operators was higher by $10 million, a total of $51.2 million. Still, the taxable AGR reported last month surpassed the result from September 2021 which was $33.9 million.</p>
<p>According to the newly released report by the gambling regulator, sports betting tax last month was $3,972,181. This result, when compared to the $4.9 million in sports wagering tax reported for September 2022, also marked a decrease.</p>
<p>Considering the start of the new NFL season last month, it’s no surprise that football posted the highest betting handle, $155.4 million. Parlay bets were also strong in September with $124.8 million in betting handle, while other sports saw $62.9 million in betting handle.</p>
<p>Highest Betting Handle Posted by DraftKings While FanDuel Follows Closely</p>
<p>DraftKings, the leading online betting operator, along with its retail partner in Indiana, Ameristar Casino, posted the highest betting handle last month, a total of $171.2 million. This resulted in $15.6 million in taxable AGR for September, bringing in nearly $1.5 million in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Second in line was Blue Chip Casino and its online betting partner FanDuel. Overall, the duo reported a betting handle of $124.8 million last month, the second-highest result out of all operators in the state. The taxable AGR posted by Blue Chip Casino and FanDuel last month was $15.1 million, bringing in $1.5 million in taxes.</p>
<p>The Commission’s latest report reveals that Belterra Casino posted the third-highest betting handle result in September, hitting $33.7 million. This resulted in $3.8 million in taxable AGR and $357,194 in taxes.</p>
