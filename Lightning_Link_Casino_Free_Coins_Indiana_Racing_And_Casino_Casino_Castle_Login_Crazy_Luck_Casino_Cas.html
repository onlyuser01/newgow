<p>Bayern Munich vs Barcelona is arguably the biggest matchup of Matchday 2 of the 2022-23 Champions League. Not only do these two teams have 11 UCL titles between them, but they also have huge ambitions for this season as well.</p>
<p>Still, the no.1 reason why Bayern Munich vs Barcelona Champions League game is the match of the round is that it will mark the return of Robert Lewandowski to Allianz Arena. The man who is Bayern‚Äôs second all-time top goalscorer (just behind legendary Gerd Muller) is playing for Barcelona in the 2022-23 season.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich Dreaming of 2022-23 UCL Title</p>
<p>Bayern Munich is expected to have an easy job in the German Bundesliga this season, even though they haven‚Äôt been too impressive over the last couple of weeks. Oddsmakers see them as strong favorites for the domestic title, with no serious contenders there who could take it away from them. With no major worries in the German league, Bayern Munich players will be able to focus their energy on the Champions League.</p>
<p>It seems that the 2022-23 UCL is already their priority no.1, as evident from the fact that they beat Inter Milan in the first round. The game was played in Italy, but the German team completely outplayed its rival, getting a 2-0 win in the end.</p>
<p>In Round 2, they‚Äôre coming to Germany to have their first home UCL game of the season. At Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich have suffered only two losses in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Robert Lewandowski Revenge Game</p>
<p>Calling Bayern Munich vs Barcelona a revenge game for Lewandowski might not be the right thing to do. Although the Polish striker sure wants his new team to win, it‚Äôs 100% sure that he holds no grudge against Bayern. In fact, we expect him to get a warm welcome from Bayern‚Äôs supporters at Allianz Arena.</p>
<p>He still loves Bayern, but Lewandowski is going to give his utmost to score again. We say ‚Äòagain‚Äô because he‚Äôs done it in each of Barca‚Äôs previous five games in all competitions. He‚Äôs put away a total of nine goals in the 2022-23 season, three of which happened in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Knowing that Lewandowski had spent eight seasons with Bayern Munich before moving to Barcelona, it‚Äôs clear that he knows these guys‚Äô strengths and weaknesses. That said, it‚Äôs only logical to expect him to put on a show on Tuesday. But what about his teammates?</p>
<p>Barcelona might not have the best team in the club history, but these guys have been playing decent soccer in 2022-23. Still, a number of their key men are still in their teens or early twenties, meaning that they just don‚Äôt have much experience with big games like Bayern Munich vs Barcelona.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs Barcelona Prediction</p>
<p>We think Bayern Munich is more likely to triumph on Tuesday, but we also expect to see a real show on the pitch of Allianz Arena. There should be plenty of goals on both ends, with Robert Lewandowski putting away at least one.</p>
<p>Picks: Bayern Munich to win; Over 2.5 goals; Robert Lewandowski to score anytime</p>
