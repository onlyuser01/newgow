<p>Online and retail players in Italy are in for a massive treat as they will be able to enjoy Multi-Stream Matchday, a V-Play soccer game that was launched by Inspired Entertainment. Sisal is set to become the first operator to offer the game to online players.</p>

<p>The CCO of Virtual Sports at Inspired Entertainment, Steve Rogers, stated that Sisal has worked with Inspired ever since Inspired launched in Italy in 2014 and during this period, both companies have worked together to bring new services and concepts on the Italian market.</p>
<p>He also added that Multi-Stream Matchday is yet another great addition to the already-existing products – V-Play Penalties, V-Play Soccer, and Women’s Soccer.

<p>Sisal Was Recently Purchased by Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>Sisal was founded in 1945 and became the first Italian company to provide offer legal gambling and betting services. Back in December, Flutter Entertainment agreed on the terms to purchase Sisal for a price of $2.2 billion. The all-cash deal is set to be finalized in the second quarter of 2022. The previous owner of Sisal was CVC, a company that purchased Sisal in 2016 for a price of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>As one of Italy’s leading gambling operators, Sisal manages several well-known brands in the country, some of which include Totip, SuperEnalotto, and Totocalcio.

<p>Most recently, Sisal extended its partnership with Evolution. Thanks to that fact, Sisal will feature several new online slots and jackpots by both NetEnt and Red Tiger. Some of the top-rated titles that Sisal customers will be able to enjoy with the expansion include Divine Fortune, Twin Spin Megaways, Gonzo’s Quest, Dragon’s Luck Deluxe, and Piggy Riches Megaways.</p>
<p>Sisal’s gaming machines and online casino managing director, Marco Bedendo, stated that NetEnt and Red Tiger are driving forces in the world of slots and these two brands are known for providing the top-performing slots, but they are also creative and have a “constant stream of innovative new titles.”</p>
