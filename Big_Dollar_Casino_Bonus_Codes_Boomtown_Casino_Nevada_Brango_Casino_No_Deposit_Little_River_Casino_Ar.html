<p>Hipther Agency, the prominent host of a number of important events on the iGaming events, has launched the registration process for the European Gaming Congress and will soon follow with registrations for the inaugural European iGaming Excellence Awards due on October 31, 2023, at Intercontinental Warsaw in Poland.</p>
<p>This marks the return of the seminal event under the aegis of Hipther Agency and follows a four-year hiatus from the last event which was held in 2019. The upcoming gathering is a two-day affair and it will be reuniting a lot of prominent stakeholders and industry specialists, mixing Hipther Agency’s signature networking events with a well-thought-out layout.</p>
<p>"We are excited to bring back European Gaming Congress due to high demand and we are taking it to a new location in 2023. Warsaw is a vibrant city and offers a great meeting ground for all European travelers, not to mention a huge market for the gaming industry and beyond.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen the location after many debates and listened to the feedback offered by our past and preregistered participants. Adding the inaugural European iGaming Excellence Awards is just a bonus and we look forward to meeting you there," said Hipther Co-Founder and Head of Business Zoltan Tuendik.</p>
<p>The two-day event is planned in stages with the first day, starting on October 30, featuring welcome drinks and an informal setting in which delegates may get to know each other, exchange impressions from the industry, discuss the event and its main points, and move into day two on a firmer foothold.</p>
<p>Then, on October 31, the conference day begins, featuring a comprehensive agenda which will focus on iGaming and gaming compliance for Western Europe. The focus will be on big regulatory changes along with the fast-developing blockchain, artificial intelligence, fintech, and esports sectors which are posing new challenges and opportunities for stakeholders in the industry.</p>
<p>Hipther Agency is also using the return of this event to host the European iGaming Excellent Awards or EiGE Awards, for short. This is a first-of-its-kind event which the organization is hosting in the hopes to distinguish the best and brightest in specific categories that are relevant to the whole industry. Registrations for the awards are due to open soon, Hipther Agency noted in a press release.</p>
<p>The event itself will be reuniting many prominent C-level executives, government officials, professionals, and compliance experts. As is the custom with Hipther Agency events, there is a unique mix of pure iGaming and the technology that is poised to potentially change the industry completely. The early bird registrations are now open for the European Gaming Congress.</p>
