    <h1>Casino Terre Haute Indiana Louisiana Casino Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa And Casino Casino Mobiles</h1>

<p>Future Anthem, an AI-powered B2B gaming tech company, concluded a Series A funding round. The company will use the money to invest in new products and provide its partners with more cutting-edge solutions.</p>
<p>The Funding Will Help the Company Grow</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Bettor Capital, an investment platform and consultancy. Other notable investors include Benjie Cherniak and Sharp Alpha Advisors, another consultancy firm.</p>
<p>Although Future Anthem refrained from commenting on the size of the investment, it implied that it has earned several million dollars. Thanks to this money, the tech firm will be able to focus on scaling its operations and developing more state-of-the-art products. The company will also improve its existing AI products and learning models as it strives to expand in the gambling and betting sector.</p>
<p>In addition, Future Anthem will be using a part of the funding to open a new headquarters in the United States. This will help the company double down on its operations in North America and improve its relations with local companies.</p>
<p>Leigh Nissim, Future Anthem’s chief executive officer and founder, commented on the funding. He called it a “significant investment” that marks a major milestone for his company. Nissim also said that the investment demonstrates the huge market and commercial confidence that operators have in Future Anthem’s cutting-edge AI-powered solutions.</p>
<p>Future Anthem – A Leader in AI Solutions</p>
<p>Future Anthem currently works with more than 20 operators and game studios. This includes major industry names such as Bally’s Corporation, Paddy Power Betfair, Betfred and Blueprint Gaming among others.</p>
<p>The company’s acclaimed AI-powered solutions are based on the world’s largest behavioral data set in the casino industry. Future Anthem’s database is based on 172 billion transactions and 250 million hours of engagement.</p>
<p>Because of this, Future Anthem’s AI-based solutions have helped numerous companies provide players with an unparalleled level of personalization. Thanks to these tools, operators can provide their customers with content tailored to their needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, Future Anthem’s new Amplifier AI solution provides a detailed analysis of customers’ behavior. This, in turn, helps to identify high risk bettors and prevent gambling harm.</p>
<p>A month ago, Future Anthem revealed the results of its State of Online Gambling survey. According to it, data usage is becoming more and more important to the quickly-growing gambling industry. Future Anthem noted that 74% of the gaming companies see data as their main point of focus.</p>
