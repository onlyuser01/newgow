    <h1>Grand Casino In Shawnee Oklahoma Twinspires Casino Casino Winnings Tax Hollywood Casino Jobs Casinos</h1>

<p>In a LinkedIn post, the former CEO said that she wants to decompress before deciding on her next executive opportunity</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, Entain’s former CEO, departed from the global gaming company recently. Almost a month after her exit, Nygaard-Andersen released a statement on LinkedIn, expressing her thoughts about the departure.</p>
<p>Entain’s ex-CEO said that the decision to leave the company did not come easily. She thanked everyone who supported her throughout her three years as CEO and praised everyone who played a role in Entain’s transformation. According to Nygaard-Andersen, the gaming group is now stronger than ever.</p>
<p>The transformation from GVC into Entain also resulted in higher standards of governance, compliance and player safety, the former CEO pointed out. She also noted that the company has now adopted a new and much more efficient strategy for growth in all markets, old and new. As a result of its strategy, the company now has “excellent quality of earnings,” Nygaard-Andersen added.</p>
<p>Entain Is Stronger than Ever</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen lauded her former team’s ability to deal with the challenges the last few years presented. According to her, the team demonstrated unparalleled professionalism and passion when tackling the pandemic head-on.</p>
<p>The Entain of today, the departed CEO said, is much more responsible. Having navigated a path to 100% regulated operation, the company now places the customer at the front and center of its business.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, Entain’s purple is now synonymous with a partner other companies and businesspeople want to work with and for, as well as a brand trusted by consumers. The company now operates in more than 30 territories and fields some 30,000 employees across its offices.</p>
<p>They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. There is enormous opportunity to innovate in the gaming industry. What has worked in the past will not always work in the present and this industry needs strategic thinkers and innovators that are passionate about doing the right thing for customers. Jette Nygaard-Andersen, ex-CEO, Entain</p>
<p>Nygaard-Andersen added that she is grateful to have had the opportunity to meet and work with many talented individuals during her time with Entain. Speaking about her plans for the future, she said that she will take a break over the holiday period and decompress before deciding on her next executive opportunity.</p>
