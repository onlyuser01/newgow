<p>Netgaming and BetConstruct are pooling their efforts to provide players and business with exciting new opportunities through a content distribution deal.</p>
<p>BetConstruct and Netgaming Ink Content Distribution Partnership</p>
<p>The days when casinos were solely considered to be places where one can only win a lump sum of money have long gone, as now most people look forward to the excitement, and the experience itself a casino brings is almost as important as the winnings, if not more.</p>
<p>The same applies to the online casino industry even more, placing an ever-expanding demand for the casino and gambling operators in general to be able to provide new forms of excitement to respond to the needs of their customers, thus pushing the creative design part of the IT industry to continuously come up with new solutions.</p>
<p>The recently announced deal for content distribution between the UK-based creative game design studio NetGaming with the provider of online gaming solutions BetConstruct is a huge step in this direction, as it will bring the whole array of NetGaming’s slot portfolio based of superhero themes, such as the one in Infinity Battle slot, to the online casino industry, while giving the former access to BetConstruct’s content distribution tool, Spring Platform, with its powerful back office tools and all-inclusive services.</p>
<p>Tapping into the vast online presence of BetConstruct, the latest content distribution agreement represents a huge step for NetGaming’s plans for continuous global expansion in key jurisdictions, and is perfectly in line with the string of high-profile deals they signed recently, including the one with Relax Gaming as part of the B2B provider’s ‘Powered By partnership’ program.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with BetConstruct in a move that is sure to strengthen our customer base”, Pallavi Deshmukh, CEO at NetGaming.</p>
<p>NetGaming is a company that has an impressive rise in the creative design industry, taking it less than three years from April 2018 when it was born, to reaching a point in time where its game content is available in 26 languages and 40 different currencies give access to players across continents, including several emerging markets.</p>
<p>Bringing the whole BetConstruct’s spectrum of tools, from the stand-alone set up to turn-key and white label solutions, at NetGaming’s disposal, matched with the aggressive strategy for rapid growth and expansion in regulated markets around the globe, creates an unparalleled opportunity for success for the creative game design studio.</p>
<p>Both sides of the signed agreement are equally excited at the prospect of their partnership, but the biggest winner of all will be the regular online casino player, presented with exciting new gaming experience through high-level virtual reality game content.</p>
