    <h1>The Meadows Casino Jacks 58 Hotel And Casino Marriott Stellaris Casino Aruba Escanaba Casino How To</h1>

<p>RAW iGaming, one of the most momentous companies in the iGaming sector, has announced an important ground-breaking acquisition in the sector</p>
<p>The company is moving forward with the addition of the FunFair Games’ multiplayer arcade game portfolio, one of the best-performing collections of titles in the iGaming industry. FunFair is a company with an established track record that has focused on building innovative and outside-of-the-box games.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming Grows Portfolio of Arcade Games</p>
<p>Now, the developer of the SuperSlice engine will also have FunFair Games added to its portfolio as well. Amongst those are titles such as Astroboomers to the Moon, an original crash-style game, and Hugo Up &amp; Away, which is one of the franchised games by FunFair Games. Another title is The Wheel of Steal which has established a track record as one of the best games to try.</p>
<p>RAW has been fast expanding its catalogue of games, including with Green Jade Games, where the company had the opportunity to grow its own portfolio with a list of skill-based arcade games. Another acquisition was realized with Spigo’s skill-based games platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest addition to its lineup, RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood welcomed the acquisition and spoke of the significance of the deal. FunFair’s multiplayer games are some of the best in the industry and adding them to the existing lineup of arcade games that RAW offers is what Wood described as a “no-brainer.”</p>
<p>Wood spoke about the series of purchases made over recent months and added that the company has been able to significantly scale up its offer in the skill and arcade games vertical, with more than 30 quality titles.</p>
<p>The partnership was naturally welcomed by FunFair Technologies COO Lloyd Purser who said that this was good news for the company and that FunFair’s portfolio was in good hands. “RAW, like FunFair, is focused on innovation and we’re happy that our multiplier games will be distributed globally as part of a market-leading portfolio. We wish RAW the very best of luck in creating the next-generation arcade offering,” Purser said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, RAW iGaming has been building up its portfolio of titles, with the latest release of Fresh SuperSymbols. The new mechanic was featured in the Mighty Buffalo SuperSymbols slot.</p>
