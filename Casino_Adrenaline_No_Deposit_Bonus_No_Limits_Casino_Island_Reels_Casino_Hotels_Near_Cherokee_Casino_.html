<p>Pack and Cash review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Pack and Cash is themed around a workday in a warehouse.</p>
<p>Players will become the efficient employees of a bustling warehouse, packing gifts and other products to be shipped out. Though it might not seem like a typical dream job, this particular warehouse is a bright and cheerful place to work at.</p>
<p>This game’s novel theme may appeal to players who are in the mood for upbeat whimsy.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A jolly tune plays in the background, accompanied by ambient warehouse sounds like garbled PA announcements and shifting machinery.</p>
<p>The conveyor belt reels are filled with colourful letters and parcels in tantalising shapes. Players will spot a heart-shaped parcel that might contain chocolates as well as others that appear to be trophies and ducks.</p>
<p>The playful packages add a warm vibe to the game and bring to mind Santa’s workshop. Every now and then, each of the symbols jiggles a little, as if someone was shaking a package to see what is inside. Upon wins, symbols burst into gold coins, adding excitement to the moment.</p>
<p>Symbols that move along the entire conveyor belt without becoming part of a win fall into a disposal incinerator. This seems a little sad in an otherwise happy-go-lucky atmosphere.</p>
<p>Slightly blurred behind the reels, players will service carts and forklifts busily moving boxes. The warehouse is bright, clean, and everyone seems happily occupied.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music create a friendly and welcoming warehouse atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Pack and Cash is a five reel, four row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel and going right.</p>
<p>All symbols are delivered from the right side, and move on conveyor belts towards the left, filling the reels.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish and new symbols move along to replace them.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>After each cascade, a win multiplier increases by +1. This is tracked on a little screen beside the reels. This multiplier resets after cascade sequences conclude.</p>
<p>As Scatter symbols move farther left along the conveyor belt reels, they become more valuable when triggering the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. During this feature, the win multiplier beside the reels does not reset.</p>
<p>Players will also be awarded additional free spins for every Scatter that lands during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Express Package symbols will all transform into the same symbol, increasing potential for winning combinations.</p>
<p>The Special Delivery feature is triggered at random during non-winning spins. During this feature, Wilds are added after other symbols are removed at random. This feature guarantees a fresh win.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.2%, slightly above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Pack and Cash has a high volatility, which means it’s a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest aiming for the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this slightly high RTP, high volatility warehouse-themed slot.</p>
<p>With decent RTP and strategy-friendly volatility, this game is a solid choice for mathematically-minded players.</p>
<p>The unconventional theme turns out to be quite charming. This, combined with the variety of bonus features, ensures that players will stay engaged.</p>
