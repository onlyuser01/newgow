<p>BetMGM has minted a first-of-its-kind partnership with Bundesliga soccer club Borussia Dortmund, offering fans to stream team games directly through the sportsbook’s app.</p>
<p>BetMGM Signs First-of-Its-Kind Deal with Borussia Dortmund</p>
<p>Bundesliga top contender Borussia Dortmund has formed a partnership with BetMGM that grants the sportsbook rights to player imagery and its logos for marketing purposes. The deal will also include social media promotions, ritzy signup offers for supporters, and co-branded content on Dortmund’s English social media channel, as well as special contests by BetMGM with team-branded prizes.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund’s head of international and commercial business Benedikt Scholz, added that BetMGM’s app would also stream the club’s matches for fans to watch on the go. He expressed his content about the deal with the US operator, saying it was “wonderful news” that US-based fans will now be able to follow games through the Entain-MGM joint-venture app.</p>
<p>“Together, we will broaden our reach and further develop our presence in the US market,” Scholz added.</p>
<p>Matt Prevost, BetMGM’s chief revenue officer, explained that given the increasing popularity of the Bundesliga in the US, such a partnership was a logical next step. He went on to add that BetMGM’s ground-breaking partnership with a German soccer club was another first for the company.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s Growing Portfolio Is in Unison with Increased Revenue Forecast</p>
<p>The new partnership comes just in time as recently BetMGM struck a deal with Borgata Casino to add a second iGaming app to its arsenal.</p>
<p>In addition, the company issued a new business forecast in January with a near-16% increase in revenue compared to the previous estimate.</p>
<p>There have been other deals with the Bundesliga, such as DraftKings’ limited streaming service for the 2019-20 season. So far, however, Entain and MGM Resorts’ joint iGaming cooperative project is the first to strike such an inclusive deal with a specific Bundesliga club.</p>
<p>BetMGM is an all-in-one gaming site that offers poker, casino games, and mobile sports in an increasing number of states. The company currently has online gaming and sports betting licenses in NJ, CO, IN, VA, WV, NV, PA, MI, TN, and IA.</p>
<p>Dortmund won the UEFA Championship League in 1997 and made it to the final in the 2013 season. The team has won the Bundesliga eight times, with the most recent win being in 2012 and winning second place in the 2019-20 edition.</p>
<p>Borussia was found in 1909 by soccer players from Dortmund and has since become Germany’s second-largest team by membership.</p>
