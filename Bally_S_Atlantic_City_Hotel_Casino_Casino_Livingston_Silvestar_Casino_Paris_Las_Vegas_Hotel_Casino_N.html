<p>Century Casinos Could Be Next Gaming Winner, Analysts Sees Double Potential</p>

<p>Regional gaming company Century Casinos is on a tear from its March lows, surging nearly 466 percent over that span. But at least one analyst believes the stock has much more upside ahead, particularly if a “transformative” acquisition comes to pass over the next several months.</p>

<p>In a note to clients last Friday, Roth Capital analyst David Bain reiterated a “buy” rating on Century with a 12-month $11 price target. That implies the stock will nearly double from its Oct. 16 close at $5.72. A move to $11 would be well above the name’s pre-pandemic peak of $8.95.</p>
<p>Colorado-based Century operates gaming properties in its home state, Missouri, and in West Virginia, and has international venues in Canada, Poland, and in the UK. However, the operator recently sold a Canadian asset, and Bain believes the company can turn its revenue mix to 80 percent US/20 percent Canada by 2022 with some smart acquisitions.</p>
<p>Century is in unique position to benefit from an unprecedented number of marketed, underpriced gaming assets,” said the analyst. “We calculate CNTY could comfortably acquire a $90 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) US gaming asset with little to no equity capital consideration.”</p>
<p>Translation: Bain believes the operator can purchase a rival without having to shell out equity, which is preferable for investors, because when companies issue new stock, current shareholders are diluted.</p>
<p>The Road to $19</p>
<p>As of the Oct. 16 close, Century has $163.62 million market capitalization, so even if it doubles in value, as Bain believes it can, it’d still be a small-cap stock.</p>
<p>Under any circumstances, a stock doubling is impressive, but approaching a quadruple is obviously moreso. That could be the case for Century, as Bain sees a road for the name possibly surging to $19, an undoubtedly impressive feat considering this was a $1 name at its March nadir.</p>
<p>If an accretive acquisition is made, Century could trade at a 4x enterprise value/EBITDA in 2022, compared to 9.1x for its peers, according to the analyst.</p>
<p>“At a two turn discount to peers, CNTY would trade for $19 per share,” said Bain.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, Wall Street is enthusiastic about Century stock, but $19 is an ambitious forecast. In roughly a decade as a publicly traded entity, the operator has only enjoyed brief moments trading above $10, never even touching $11, let alone $19.</p>
<p>‘Transformative’ Deal Could Happen</p>
<p>While Century is one of the smallest publicly traded gaming outfits in the US, its management team has a reputation for making shrewd deals, and Bain believes another such acquisition could be in the works, saying a “transformative” transaction could be unveiled over the next six months.</p>
<p>The analyst notes the combination of larger gaming enterprises either grappling with issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, working to strengthen finances, focusing on iGaming and sports betting, or all of the above, is leaving some assets underpriced, perhaps positioning a company like Century to strike.</p>
<p>“CNTY is one of a handful of companies with the balance sheet capability to pursue such assets, which combined with a proven M&amp;A record/management and portfolio, that such an acquisition could leapfrog its current stock multiple/shareholder base, in our view,” said Bain.</p>
