<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>Replying your questions: account was verified and ive done multiple deposits and withdraws in the past. Maybe verified 3-4 months ago, I’m not sure the exact date. And I’ve claimed bonus on my own.</p>
<p>Last time I tried to talk was to cancel via email yesterday and they said I need to contact again to cancel the account 24h later.</p>
<p>My problem here is that, I thought I was using the bonus money while playing on the bonus slots category, but instead I was playing my funds, there wasnt a notification or warning that I will play with my funds, as the category name is PLAY WITH BONUS with limited slots and ive played there before (by coincidence i didnt had any funds and went normal) but 3 days ago I had funds and they were used without any warning that I will be using real funds on the category PLAY WITH BONUS.</p>
<p>The UX on the website is misleading and I used my funds without my knowledge(which is unheard of), and then the customer support is robotic and leads no where. And to be 100% honest im not super experienced in online casino and bonuses, but nonetheless the UX and communication should be clear if extracting your funds, also there wasn't the counter of my funds there, only the bonus funds. Should be clear of using your funds, shouldnt be room for doubt or it start to seem scammy.</p>
<p>I dont expect any funds returned to me, I will not play in fairspin any more and hope my issue makes aware of other people. Because honestly I spent thousands in fairspin, is not the 375US$ that will make any difference. My issue is the principle on how the casino treat a customer with an issue that provides a couple of thousand US$ every month, I rather take my money and play where im respected.</p>
<p>Thank you for the feedback</p>
