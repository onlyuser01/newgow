<p>On Tuesday night, the mystery player made a $0.10 bet on an Ancient Fortunes: Zeus game.</p>
<p>The online game is made by Microgaming. The company is a privately-held gambling software enterprise based in the United Kingdom’s Isle of Man</p>
<p>Tuesday’s win surpasses the prior DraftKings record jackpot won in April. That player was paid $1.97 million. The visitor made a $0.10 bet on an Extra Chilli Megaways game.</p>
<p>Second Win</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after Tuesday’s newest record-breaking win, another player won $1.44M. That player made a $0.10 bet on a 12 Western Horseshoes game.</p>
<p>Crowning two millionaires in 24 hours was a monumental week for DraftKings Casino,” Jason March, vice president of DraftKings’ iGaming marketing and operations unit, said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>“The ability to give our customers the chance to win a big progressive jackpot on over 100 games makes me so proud of our product,” March added.</p>
<p>As of last week, DraftKings Casino’s total progressive jackpot payouts in New Jersey came to $13.49 million since the offering’s launch.</p>
<p>New Roulette Game</p>
<p>DraftKings’ also recently launched its Auto American Live Roulette. The game is similar to stadium roulette played at brick-and-mortar gaming properties.</p>
<p>Auto American Live Roulette is played on an automatic roulette wheel. It operates 24/7 and has a backup wheel, so there is continuous action, the company explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Currently, DraftKings Auto American Live Roulette is offered only to eligible DraftKings Casino customers in New Jersey, according to the statement.</p>
<p>But soon the company will provide the new game and additional offerings in other select locations.</p>
<p>DraftKings recently debuted an online casino game called Hart-Race Hold’em. The game is a new spin on Texas hold’em.</p>
<p>DraftKings Casino is now live in five states. It launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Office</p>
<p>Also, in March, DraftKings presented its new office in southwest Las Vegas. The 90,000-square-foot space is located in a four-story structure at the UnCommons complex.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 workers will be housed at the DraftKings office. That makes it the company’s second-largest office in the U.S. after its Boston office.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas office has more than 130 sports trading desks. It also includes multimedia walls and stadium-style seating.</p>
<p>Workers have access to a 7,500-square-foot cafeteria and event space. Employees also can be taught games in a casino training pit.</p>
<p>At the new complex, company employees can also enjoy a 500-square-foot interactive putt-view putting green, private and public outdoor spaces, and specialized rooms for mothers and children.</p>
<p>The company’s new office is located in Matter Real Estate Group’s UnCommons complex. The 40-acre, $850 million workplace and mixed-use community is now under construction.</p>
<p>Offices and retail spaces are in the process of opening. A second phase will open soon.</p>
