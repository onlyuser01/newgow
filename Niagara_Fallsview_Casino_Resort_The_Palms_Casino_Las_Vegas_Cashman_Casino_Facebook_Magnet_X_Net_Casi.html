<p>Pariplay Boosts Its Footing In the United States with the GAN Agreement</p>
<p>After negotiating a deal to supply its proprietary games portfolio to platform provider GAN, Pariplay Ltd, the leading aggregator and content provider of iGaming products, has dramatically increased its presence in the United States.</p>
<p>Pariplay Boosts GAN iGaming Portfolio in US</p>
<p>Pariplay has a large game library of more than 120 high-quality games. The content includes a combination of classic and new slots with a variety of themes, features, and volatility to cater to a wide range of players.</p>
<p>Stallion Fortunes, Mystery Fox, and Dragons of the North are among the best-selling games.</p>
<p>With GAN’s plug-and-play aggregator platform open to operators in three states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan – Pariplay will broaden its presence in the fast-growing US market.</p>
<p>GAN currently provides online solutions to about 20 US Real Money and Social Casinos, including Penn Interactive, Borgata, Seneca, and Twin River Casino. GAN also makes its platform available to Italian operators.</p>
<p>Pariplay, which launched in New Jersey with Rush Street in February this year, sees a lot of promise in the growing US online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Chief commercial officer at Pariplay, Christine Lewis, said: “Establishing a presence and building our brand in the US market is a priority for us this year. The US is growing at an impressive rate with more states currently considering legalizing online gaming, and our objective is to be at the forefront of the developments.”</p>
<p>Lewis continued by saying that Pariplay will get their games in front of a significant audience across multiple states by working with GAN, a well-established supplier in the market with prominent operator partners, and the company is looking forward to growing their business in the US together.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Continues to Grow Business Through Partnerships</p>
<p>Chief commercial officer at GAN, Jeff Berman, praised Pariplay by saying that the vast content portfolio of Pariplay includes creative games that provide optimum entertainment and interaction for all types of players.</p>
<p>GAN’s current offering will be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of Pariplay’s games, which will provide their partners with premium titles that the company is confident slot fans will enjoy.</p>
<p>Back in March, Pariplay added another studio to its Fusion site, with Gamshy joining the ranks of iGaming service providers.</p>
<p>Pariplay can now offer an even more valuable portfolio of games to current partners while also attracting new ones thanks to Gamshy’s diverse selection of games.</p>
<p>Jumping Sushi, Inferno, Western Barn, and Fruit Tribe are just a few of Gamshy’s titles that are common among players.</p>
<p>All of these games are now available on Pariplay’s global network, allowing the studio to reach new markets and increase its visibility.</p>
