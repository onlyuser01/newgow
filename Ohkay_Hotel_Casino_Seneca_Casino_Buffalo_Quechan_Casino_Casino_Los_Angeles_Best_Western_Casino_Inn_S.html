    <h1>Ohkay Hotel Casino Seneca Casino Buffalo Quechan Casino Casino Los Angeles Best Western Casino Inn S</h1>

<p>They won't complete the KYC process.</p>
<p>I deposited once, lost, and hadn't played for a while. But, I started playing again after receiving an email for a no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>After I had increased my balance to 77 euros and applied for withdrawal, I was asked to complete the KYC process. My identification and payment method were authenticated.</p>
<p>I uploaded a residence certificate issued by the city hall for address confirmation, yet they refuse to authenticate it.</p>
<p>While it is natural for my account to be in Latin notation and my residence certificate in Japanese notation, they won't authenticate it for that reason.</p>
<p>It becomes obvious if you run Japanese through a translation feature.</p>
<p>They won't lend an ear even after I sent them two credit cards in Latin notation.</p>
<p>I have no loss as it was a no-deposit bonus, but this is the first time I've come across such a casino.</p>
<p>I've played at over 20 casinos, and this is the first time I've not been authenticated with a residence certificate.</p>
<p>I feel malice.</p>
