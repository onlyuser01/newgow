    <h1>Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Mill Casino Hustler Casino Live Results Double Down</h1>

<p>Hacksaw is taking a decisive step in the Italian iGaming market. This is part of the B2B supplier’s overall strategy that will see the company expand in more markets in Europe and with some of the leading names in the industry. Commenting on this partnership, Hacksaw CEO Marcus Cordes said that he was pleased with the opportunity to provide players with established game titles which will now be available on the Italian market as part of 888casino’s game library.</p>
<p>Cordes further said that Hacksaw will seek to grow its local presencewithother operators and that the entire company was thankful for the opportunity to get started with 888. There are more important developments coming, Cordes assured, and said that 2023 will be an important year for Hacksaw in Italy, Europe, and beyond. Speaking of the supplier’s global ambitions, Hacksaw already holds multiple licenses.</p>
<p>The company managed to acquire a string of licenses in 2022, securing permits from Spain and Isle of Man, Romania, and not least, Ontario. Hacksaw has already confirmed that it will be launching in the United States in the first quarter of the upcoming year. As to the games that 888 will benefit from, the company has numerous options in mind, including Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis, and Joker Bombs among others.</p>
<p>Hacksaw develops instant and scratch card games, slots, and more. The company is regulated and operational in 18 markets and has an established reputation for being one of the most trusted developers of products. 888 VP B2C Casino Talya Benyamini was similarly excited with the news and said that Hacksaw Gaming is a brand that will definitely help expand 888’s content offering and create a strong proposition for Italian players.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Hacksaw Gaming has been able to secure a license from West Virginia, an iGaming state, but it has not really launched yet, something that should happen next year as confirmed by the company’s chief executive.</p>
<p>Hacksaw will be bringing a ton of titles, including Alpha Eagle, Pug Life, Undead Fortune, Break Bones, and so many others. More games are in the pipeline as well, with Hacksaw keen to dive into one of the biggest future online casino markets in the world, the US.</p>
