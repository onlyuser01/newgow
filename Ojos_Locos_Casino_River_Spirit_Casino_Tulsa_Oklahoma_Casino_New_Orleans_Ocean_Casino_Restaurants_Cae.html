<p>Pennsylvania regulators are inviting the public to take a more active part in the process of casino license renewal of Mount Airy Casino Resort, announcing a public hearing next month, Pocono Record informed.</p>
<p>Public Opinion Matters</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) will hold a public hearing on August 3, 2022, at Paradise Township Municipal Building in Monroe County and is asking the people who wish to deliver statements related to the issue of Mount Airy Casino Resort’s license as a Category 2 slot machine operator to submit them in person there.</p>
<p>People wishing to submit comments, in either verbal or written form, should register by August 1 via a dedicated link on the PGCB website.</p>
<p>The invitation is part of the PGCB’s procedure related to license renewals under which the regulator gathers public input, other documents and evidence to help it make an informed decision on whether a particular incumbent should have its license renewed or not.</p>
<p>Following the public hearing, the PGCB will allow the casino to provide its arguments and evidence why its license should be renewed at a second public hearing which will take place in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Casino licenses are subject to renewal every four years and the last time Mount Airy Casino’s license was renewed, all seven board members determined that the casino operator had fulfilled its obligations under its previously-approved casino operator’s license and voted unanimously in favor of the renewal.</p>
<p>Demonstrate Evidence of Suitability and Eligibility</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino Resort will be given the opportunity to “demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, its eligibility and suitability for renewal” during the second hearing, touch on issues such as “good character, honesty and integrity,” as well as provide evidence related to the tax revenue generated, jobs created, diversity plan implementation, and “involvement in the surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino has been among the major contributors to numerous improvement initiatives not only in Monroe County but in the five neighboring counties – Wayne, Pike, Lackawanna, Carbon and Northampton – providing funding through the Commonwealth Financial Authority to help develop its communities, businesses and projects of public interest. Last month, the state allocated $1.35 million to fund 12 development projects in Wayne and Pike Counties.</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino Resort became the first AAA four Diamond Casino Resort in Pennsylvania and has kept its distinction for over a decade now. In September 2021, the resort had its prestigious rating renewed.</p>
