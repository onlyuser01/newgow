    <h1>Soaring Eagle Casino Tahoe Casino Seneca Resort Casino Lucky Land Casino Casinos In Lake Charles Ari</h1>

<p>Aristocrat, the global gaming giant, has posted its latest quarterly results for the three-month period ending on September 30, 2022. According to the latest numbers, the company’s EBITDA increased by 20% to AU$1.85 billion ($1.25 billion at the time of writing). Net profit after tax also jumped by 13.9% and ended at $AU1.05 billion ($710 million).</p>
<p>Strong Revenue Across the Board for Aristocrat in Q3</p>
<p>These results are aligned with the company’s efforts to expand in both the land-based and online gaming sector, as Aristocrat has proven to be one of the most resilient suppliers in the industry.</p>
<p>While challenged by the rapid shift in supply lines and vacillating demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and global lockdowns, the company has found a clear path to robust growth, sustainability and used its momentum to transfer its operational expertise into iGaming, while doubling down on its landbased bread-and-butter.</p>
<p>North America was one of the main markets for the company, and in fact, Aristocrat attributed its 17.7% jump in revenue to some AU$5.57 billion ($3.77 billion) precisely because of how successful its operations in the region have been. North American gaming has been driving sales, but elsewhere the company has been doing just as well, managing supply chains smartly and getting an additional boost from other markets in which it is present.</p>
<p>Aristocrat has navigated global markets one region at a time and done so well. The Americas grew by 32.3% for the company to $2.42 billion ($1.64 billion) and Australia and New Zealand added 15.2% to AU$460.7 million ($311 million). The company has been banking smartly on various new products and verticals.</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s social gaming platform Pixel United also drive steady growth and clocked AU$2.59 billion ($1.75 billion) in revenue. Aristocrat CEO and managing director Trevor Croker was absolutely pleased with the results achieved by his company over the period. The present results were evidence that the company’s growth strategy worked well. The executive expects further acceleration, too, and is already talking about a post-COVID recovery that has been going strong.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Equally Focused on Online Strategy</p>
<p>Croker confirmed that Aristocrat is making concentrated efforts to scale its presence in online RMG through its “build and buy” strategy, and that has been paying so far. The new business unit, Anaxi, has been doing well, with its clear-cut focus on North American iGaming, which is set to continue growing in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“As we look ahead, we believe that Aristocrat’s outstanding product portfolios, growing operational resilience and capability, along with a highly engaged team and strong culture, positions us well to maintain our momentum despite uncertain conditions,” he concluded.</p>
