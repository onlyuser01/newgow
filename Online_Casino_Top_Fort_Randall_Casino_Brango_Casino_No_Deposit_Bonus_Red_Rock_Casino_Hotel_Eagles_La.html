<p>The sports betting division of apparel company Fanatics has confirmed plans to collaborate with the Columbus Blue Jackets and bring a new retail sports betting experience</p>
<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming will be working with the team in the Columbus Arena District and create a new dedicated sports betting experience that will allow fans to place a wager in person and get access to Fanatics’ increasingly growing sports betting offer.</p>
<p>Bringing Retail Betting to Nationwide Arena</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Blue Jackets Sr. VP and COO Cameron Scholvin said that the team was constantly looking for new and exciting ways to connect with fans and that this collaboration with Fanatics was just what the team needed.</p>
<p>He welcomed the chance to be working with Fanatics Betting and Gaming on a world-class sportsbook location just outside the Nationwide Arena, which is the very heart of the Arena District. The news was naturally welcomed by Fanatics Betting and Gaming chief business officer Ari Borod who added:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be partnering with the Blue Jackets to bring a world-class retail experience to the arena district in downtown Columbus. Fanatics CBO Ari Borod</p>
<p>Borod said that the Jackets are one of the youngest teams in the National Hockey League and a team that is filled with promise for the future. Bringing outstanding sports betting experiences to the team’s fans is just what the Jackets would love, Borod continued and said that Fanatics is fully prepared to assist.</p>
<p>State-of-the-Art Sportsbook by Fanatics</p>
<p>As to the upcoming sports betting project, the new retail facility is promising to be worth everyone’s while. The sportsbook is set to sprawl on 5,000 square feet and features four betting windows along with 14 self-service betting kiosks, a LED screen video wall, 20 TV monitors, and other amenities, such as a full-service restaurant.</p>
<p>Fanatics will bring fans coverage of not just hockey, but also every other professional sport that it can provide legally to sports fans in Columbus, including soccer, tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, college, and professional football, and more. Fanatics has recently acquired the US assets of PointsBet in a $225 million deal which saw the company bid and win against one of its biggest local rivals, DraftKings.</p>
