<p>Flaming Hot review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Flaming Hot is a straightforward jackpot slot with a fruit machine theme. The symbols are all bars, fruits, and sevens.</p>
<p>Like most fruit machine based slots, the theme lacks much individuality but will work well for those who enjoy the style. Though it should be noted that there are plenty of almost identical slots in this field, many of which have better RTPs and/or higher volatility.</p>
<p>Win in the Flaming Hot slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are unremarkable, a solid mix of classic symbols drawn in a classic style with an orange background to emphasise the "flaming hot" of the title.</p>
<p>There is no music in Flaming Hot, but the game does offer a riot of old style slot noises for the spin and win states, and even for the special symbols.</p>
<p>Overall, the combined audio-visual effect is nothing special, and it becomes hard to distinguish this slot from a half dozen similar ones, some even produced by the same company.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>If the theme of this review is Flaming Hot’s dire averageness, then the gameplay section is not going to buck the trend. This is a five reel, four row slot, with forty winlines.</p>
<p>In another unimaginative gesture at being distinct, the makers have added a gamble feature and a randomised jackpot game.</p>
<p>Although this slot is one of the most popular games overall, there is little to mark this game out from the crowd in terms of gameplay.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Wilds appear only on reels two, three and four.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol pays out if the player lands three or more anywhere on the reels. It pays out twice your bet per spin for three Scatters, twenty times for four symbols, and five-hundred times if you hit five of them.</p>
<p>There is also a progressive Jackpot system with four jackpots of varying sizes with a suit of cards associated with each one.</p>
<p>A player can be awarded a Jackpot at random at the end of any spin. When a player is given a jackpot, they must play a picking game. Twelve cards are placed face down and the player turns cards over one at a time. The player then wins the jackpot associated with the first suit to come up three times in the picking game.</p>
<p>Paytable for the Flaming Hot slot machine</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which would make it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies if the return to player were higher. Unfortunately, the return to player of this game is 95.52%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€240.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Forgettable and dull, the main attraction of Flaming Hot is its high volatility and the jackpot feature which offers a shot at truly huge payouts.</p>
<p>At the design and gameplay levels Flaming Hot offers nothing to attract the more discerning player and adds insult to injury with a below average return to player.</p>
