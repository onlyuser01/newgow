<p>22 Locations Announced for 2013-2014 WSOP Circuit</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the WSOP Circuit has become a popular addition to the World Series of Poker calendar. While the format has changed from year to year, it’s now used as a way to allow players from around the United States and Canada to enjoy a WSOP experience at their local casinos at a fraction of the cost of a normal WSOP event.</p>
<p>This week, Caesars announced the official schedule for the 2013-2014 WSOP Circuit – one that will expand on the existing tour to reach a record 22 different locations throughout the year. The new events include a stop at the famous Casino Montreal, adding a second Canadian event to the mix.</p>
<p>The Circuit tour will begin in August, when Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut hosts the first tour event. Foxwoods, which boasts one of the world’s largest poker rooms, was first added to the circuit schedule last season.</p>
<p>Each stop on the Circuit will offer a variety of events, all of which feature reasonably affordable buy-ins for players. Many tournaments start at $365, while the Main Event at each location will have a buy-in of $1,675.</p>
<p>As has been the norm in recent seasons, the WSOP Circuit will conclude with a National Championship event. The top 100 players from the Circuit season will get freeroll entries, and the WSOP itself will put $1 million into the prize pool. It’s likely that top WSOP players will once again be given the option to buy into the tournament for $10,000 as well.</p>
<p>That said, there will be some major changes in store for the National Championship. Most notably, the event won’t be taking place in Las Vegas, instead moving to Caesars Atlantic City. According to a WSOP press release, players will have the chance to play in a last chance online tournament that will give away the last seats into the National Championship – assuming that Caesars gets regulatory approval to run online poker in New Jersey by then, of course.</p>
<p>“The WSOP Circuit continues to pick up momentum,” said Ty Stewart, executive director of the WSOP. “We’re proud to have become North America’s largest poker tour, and we believe we have the most complete offering out there. With big fields, good value, and exciting stops, the action doesn’t stop all year long.”</p>
<p>The WSOP Circuit may not get the attention that the “real” WSOP receives, but it is a good way for poker players to get a taste of WSOP action without having to travel to Las Vegas. Here’s a quick rundown of the upcoming Circuit schedule:</p>
