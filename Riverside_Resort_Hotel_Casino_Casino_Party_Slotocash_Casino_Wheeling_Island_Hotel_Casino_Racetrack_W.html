<p>The leading iGaming and retail turnkey solutions provider, Pronet Gaming, announced it plans to grow within regulated markets in Asia. The announcement came Friday and reaffirms the company's strong growth in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming revealed that in the last year and a half it has seen significant growth primarily driven by new partnerships. During that time, the company provided its innovative solutions to multiple casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The recent growth created an opportunity for Pronet to invest in IT and new offices, targeting expansion within Asian markets. Moreover, the company will offer its services to brands, which will enable the creation of localized products that have a significant advantage when compared to competitors.</p>
<p>Growing within the Asian region would also require Pronet Gaming to start a recruitment campaign. Considering that this is one of the most lucrative markets that hold significant potential, the company would need employees from different fields such as IT support and development, account management, marketing, as well as sales.</p>
<p>As a leading iGaming solutions provider, Pronet is famous for launching multiple innovative solutions. FastBet is one such industry-first solution, that was launched to help optimize the customers' experience. The innovative solution allows bettors to place multiple single bets for different sports via a single interaction, without the need for a bet slip.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pronet customers can leverage its Popular Events and Popular Bets widgets. The widgets offer the most popular wagers and sports within a given jurisdiction. Ensuring that the most popular content is displayed, the widgets refresh every five minutes.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, offering customized features for sports betting gives Pronet a key advantage. The company's unique suite of widgets and solutions enables consumers to enjoy a customized experience, while at the same time increasing the revenue for their partners and boosting fan engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Alex Leese, Pronet Gaming's CEO, commented on the topic in a statement released on Friday, June 24, 2022. He said: "An Asian market entry was always in the plan and required a real focus on ensuring that we had the right product to compete. I'm obviously really pleased that we are now able to do that sooner rather than later."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the company's recent success, Leese pointed out that it is a testament to the hard work and popularity of its offering. Additionally, he pointed out that Pronet's new partners are "looking for an affordable, yet tailored solution."</p>
<p>Speaking about the workforce related to the Asian market, Leese revealed that the company would need to expand its team of specialists that will seek to provide localized service. In conclusion, he predicted that Pronet "will have a compelling proposition moving forward."</p>
