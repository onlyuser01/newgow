    <h1>Orion Casino Casino Poconos Pa Q Casino Dubuque Casino Guitars Reno Hotels And Casino Wintomato Casi</h1>

<p>Honestly I've been playing with these guys for a few months I've had some good ups but then a lot of downs with almost no kickback from the site other than the right back which is God awful. The loyalty program is non-existent it's just kind of a train wreck there's no incentive there to a gaine. levels realistically other than flash dicing. The site would be a lot better if the mods would actually step in and regulate the other mods and if the admins would actually listen to The players about the problems.</p>
<p>My one biggest pet peeve here is that I'm trying to deal with the support but it's just a moderator in the support chat that doesn't allow anything to get done let alone I've been asking for weeks about certain aspects of the dice game and variables in their scripting with no response. I've hit a point also where I found multiple trends while playing dice after making deposits that I brought to supports attention and have been basically muted throughout the whole site.</p>
<p>I got to say the community is nice but if you step out of line and question anything you get a hard mute and have to deal with the issues by yourself instead of having anybody chime in about their experiences.</p>
<p>I could care less about one of the mods that constantly is giving me issues when trying to report something to support they've pretty much ruined this whole experience for me at this site.</p>
<p>There's also questionable triggers in their dicing script that they're not showing that lead to the trends by the way there's no other explanation when I get a constant curve repeatedly on ups and downs.</p>
<p>Other than that the site's great it just needs to change in the mod scene and maybe a facelift on the actual loyalty program and rake back system. And maybe needs to update their crash and dicing to be a little bit more updated and maybe just maybe make it feel a little less dirty I guess would be the best way to put it.</p>
