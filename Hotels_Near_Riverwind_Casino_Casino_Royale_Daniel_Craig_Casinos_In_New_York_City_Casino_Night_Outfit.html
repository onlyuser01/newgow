<p>Online software provider developing games for the iGaming industry, CT Interactive, announced it expanded its European presence. On Thursday, the company revealed that it entered the regulated gambling market in Slovakia.</p>
<p>The announcement came after the developer obtained a certificate allowing it to offer solutions and content to operators in the country. To achieve the certification, CT Interactive had to undergo testing and meet an extensive list of requirements.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Slovakian market, the company prepared an initial package with localized market-tailored games. The list of games includes Big Joker, Devil's Fruits, 20 Star Party, Lucky Clover, Hot 7s X 2, Hell's Sevens, Coffee Magic, Pick the Pig and Chilli Fruits. Although this list was deemed as an initial package, CT Interactive vowed to introduce its innovative Jackpot concepts along with more games for the Slovakian market soon.</p>
<p>Lachezar Petrov, CT Interactive's CEO, commented in a statement released on October 13, 2022. He revealed: "Now that we have entered the Slovak market, we are thrilled to continue delivering high-quality, enthralling games and gaming solutions to our partners."</p>
<p>Petrov explained that the company is pleased to enter the market in Slovakia and begin building a network of partners in the country. He acknowledged that the entry in Slovakia complements CT Interactive's strategy for growing and strengthening positions within regulated gambling markets. Last but not least, Petrov said: "We pride ourselves on being a reliable, trustworthy and secure partner to customers and players."</p>
<p>It was a busy month for CT Interactive. Besides its entry in Slovakia, the company announced a new partnership last week with leading operator TotoGaming. Before that, on October 10, the company revealed that 20 of its popular games gained a certificate from the Malta Gaming Authority, the gambling regulator in Malta.</p>
<p>Earlier in October, CT Interactive expanded its Latvian market presence. The company revealed that it joined forces with synottip.lv and joker.lv, two of the most popular online gambling websites in the country. The terms of the recent deal saw the duo gain access to ten games from CT Interactive.</p>
<p>Just before the announcement of the Latvian deal, the company also expanded its presence in Romania. As a result, CT Interactive launched 20 new certified games within the regulated market in the country, bolstering its presence even further.</p>
<p>Currently, the company offers more than 200 HTML5 casino games, which can be played via desktop, tablet or mobile devices. CT Interactive's titles currently are certified in 17 different jurisdictions and offer content in different categories. Overall, more than 800 online gambling operators around the world offer content from the leading developer.</p>
