    <h1>Buffalo Seneca Casino Red Rock Casino Restaurants Casino Near Atlanta Pokerstars Casino Bonus Code C</h1>

<p>The well-seasoned industry veteran is joining the Seneca Gaming Corporation as executive director at a time of rapid changes</p>
<p>Monique Sebastian will pursue and focus on growth as part of the company, having served for more than two decades in various entertainment companies and held numerous positions commanding the same level of responsibility. Sebastian recently held a position at Foxwoods Resort Casino where she secured performances by Alicia Keys, John Legend, Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin Hart, and many others.</p>
<p>Bringing Entertainment to the Heart of Seneca Gaming</p>
<p>She has welcomed her appointment, adding that she was delighted to now be a part of Seneca Gaming Corporation’s efforts to bring the best value-added entertainment to guests. Sebastian added:</p>
<p>I am eager to elevate and achieve a dynamic and diverse entertainment program that brings together A-list performers and performances with cutting-edge concepts to deliver unforgettable experiences for our guests. Monique Sebastian</p>
<p>She will be tasked with artist bookings and performances for a number of properties, including the Seneca Niagara Event Center, Bear’s Den Showroom at Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino and the Seneca Allegany Event Center at Seneca Allegany Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Sebastian will work on new experiences and events, both indoors and outdoors, to continue attracting tourists, and she will follow in a tradition that sees Seneca Gaming Corp. attract prominent celebrities who in turn drive footfall at its properties.</p>
<p>Seneca Gaming CMO Melissa Free was excited and happy with the news of welcoming Sebastian, adding that the newly-appointed director of entertainment has a successful track record in driving overall entertainment value for the businesses she works for. She was hailed as a creative and innovative thinker, with Free adding:</p>
<p>We have world-class resorts that attract world-class talent. With Monique’s energy, vision and proven experience, we are excited to maximize our offerings and to stand apart as the preeminent live entertainment destinations in our region. Seneca Gaming CMO Melissa Free</p>
<p>Sebastian Embarks on an Ambitious and Challenging Job</p>
<p>The venues that Sebastian will be in charge of present a new challenge for her, ranging from 2,500-people entertainment settings to a more private and hush-hush 440-seat theater at the Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino. Sebastian will also have to add to a lineup of performers who already include Jay Leno, David Spade, Smokey Robinson, Gary Allan, Craig Ferguson, KISS, and many others.</p>
<p>Ensuring a good flow of stardom at casino properties has become synonymous with driving revenue at gaming floors as entertained customers are usually spending players, but performances also boost revenue spending and lay the groundwork for future bookings.</p>
