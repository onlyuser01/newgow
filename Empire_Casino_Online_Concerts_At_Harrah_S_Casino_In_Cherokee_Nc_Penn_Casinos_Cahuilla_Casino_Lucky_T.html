    <h1>Empire Casino Online Concerts At Harrah S Casino In Cherokee Nc Penn Casinos Cahuilla Casino Lucky T</h1>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response, my name is Daniele.</p>
<p>The verification process started about 10 days ago, I would like to point out that the gaming account had already been limited for about a week.</p>
<p>During the verification process, they immediately approved my photo ID, copy of the credit card used to deposit and proof of residency.</p>
<p>They then also asked me for the account statement proving the deposit using the indicated card, and this is where the problems arose: first</p>
<p>Instead, they rejected the screenshot in which I showed the transaction from my home banking relating to the aforementioned deposit; then I proceeded to send a new document, the actual account statement, for the transactions from 01/12/23 to 10/01/24 as requested by them.</p>
<p>This second time too they asked me for further documentation relating to this deposit, and when I sent a screenshot with the details of the transaction, which reported the words "payment made on a foreign POS", they closed my account.</p>
<p>I tried both sending emails and speaking via live chat, the only thing I managed to get from the live chat was that they told me that I used cards registered to third parties (which is obviously not true).</p>
<p>From their email support@rabona.com they reply to me that there has been a violation of point 9.1 of the T&amp;Cs, which however includes a whole series of General Conditions and I don't understand precisely what they are complaining about.</p>
<p>The only thing I notice is that, when I deposited the €150 on Rabona, on my home banking the transaction was €155.39 (I attach the screenshot with the details to understand if this is normal).</p>
<p>At the time I didn't have any problems because I thought it was about commissions, but now I wonder if it's this discrepancy that makes him believe that the deposit didn't come from me.</p>
<p>I also attach the screenshot of the live chat and remain available for any further information.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your support,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
