<p>and then this current month i knew that evolution gaming had solved the issue with my account so i requested a new password at 12/5/2021 at 6:57 PM and i was able to login into my account and i see my balance there so i request a new withdraw of my all balance that i confirm into my email and again i contact support since it was several hours since i request my withdraw and nothing same old song about the withdraw had to be approval by the staff and that sometimes takes some more time and i told that i woudn't wait another week since i had the same problem before and for my surprise i got this email yesterday saying that my account was closed again. I have video/ image proof of all my winings are legit. So i kindly ask you guys to look into my case before i start a lawsuit with my laywer for defamation against my good name, to get acess to my wins and also to get all data in my name and the removal of all my data according to european laws of RGPD in 7bitcasino.</p>
