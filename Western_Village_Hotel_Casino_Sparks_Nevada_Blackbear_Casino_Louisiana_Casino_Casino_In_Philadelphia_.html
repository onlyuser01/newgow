    <h1>Western Village Hotel Casino Sparks Nevada Blackbear Casino Louisiana Casino Casino In Philadelphia</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Joined Energy Casino last night, did four deposits (50 GBP, 100 GBP, 200 GBP and 400 GBP) for a total of 750 GBP. Hit the jackpot on Temple Tumble 2 and withdrew 3113.03 GBP.</p>
<p>This morning received the following email from Energy Casino :</p>
<p>"During internal checks, we noticed that you already have a second player account with us.</p>
<p>Please note that according to our terms and conditions:</p>
<p>4 i. The CLIENT is not allowed to register if he/she is already registered on Energy WEBSITES with an account. Only one account per person is allowed. Holding more than one Account is known as "multi-accounting" and is strictly forbidden and directly deemed to be fraudulent regardless of whether the other Account is registered under the user’s own details, other Energy users’ details, third parties’ details (other than Energy users) or false details. Energy reserves the right to close any CLIENT account, at any time. If we consider that multiple Accounts have been opened in genuine error, the unused balances will be returned back to the customer. If Energy has a reasonable grounds to believe that fraud has been committed, Energy reserves the right to cancel any related transaction, any bonus or any other promotion without prejudice to any other action or redress we might avail ourselves of.</p>
<p>The full text of the terms and conditions is available at the following link.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to a violation of this condition, we canceled your winnings.</p>
<p>Your duplicate account has been closed."</p>
<p>1) Only have one account with them the one I opened yesterday with correct and accurate data. Didn't have any issues with the deposits.</p>
<p>2) In any case, my winnings were not related to any benefit of a new account opening so would not justify canceling my winnings.</p>
<p>Would like to have my withdrawal and winnings correctly processed since there are no reasons it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>This is very frustrating, opened an account with them based on their good reputation on Casino Guru and didn't expect that one coming.</p>
