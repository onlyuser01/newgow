<p>Stake.com, one of the world’s fastest-growing iGaming and sports betting companies, has secured a new partnership intended to consolidate the company’s growth opportunities and ensure that it achieves better channelization and monetization of its existing player bases.</p>
<p>To this end, Stake.com has teamed up with Enteractive, a company that focuses on reactivating players and taps into lapsed accounts to help bring back customers who may have lost interest or fallen out of the habit of betting.</p>
<p>Enteractive does this through an intelligent mix of technology and in-person interaction which seeks to explore and identify those user accounts that are interested in returning and continuing to bet on the operator’s sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Stake.com Director of Commercial Jarrod Febbraio was highly appreciative of this new collaboration, and lauded Enteractive for its proven track record in developing and delivering technologies that stand out in both sports betting and iGaming. He hailed the approach employed by the company to ensure that the stated goals and final results meet eye-to-eye.</p>
<p>"Their one-to-one approach is particularly effective in transforming non-funded accounts and reactivating dormant player accounts. We’re excited to see this collaboration maximize the Lifetime Player Value (LPV) for these segments, optimizing our active players, and ultimately increasing bottom line revenues," Febbraio said, not hesitating to extol the virtue of the company and its distinct track record in securing successful reactivation campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2023 alone, Enteractive had some solid numbers to report, with more than 8.1m consumers reactivated across different verticals, bringing in an additional €59m for operators across the world, and leveraging technology such as (Re)Activation Cloud technology platform.</p>
<p>Executive B2B Sales Kelly Briffa was similarly excited to be teaming up with Stake.com and helping the company to work on its core performance markers, including the reactivation of dormant accounts which will help with its long-term growth.</p>
<p>"Our sustainable approach, seamless integration, and solid returns show that conversion or reactivation campaigns should not be overlooked. Each call adds value to both the player's brand experience and bottom-line revenues," Briffa noted.</p>
<p>Apart from taking care of its customer bases, Stake.com has been equally keen to continue growing its footprint and add new partners and expand its operations. The company notably bought out Betfair Colombia’s business late last year, buying the Betfair Colombia subsidiary in the country and setting a firm foothold into the jurisdiction.</p>
