    <h1>Casino In Scottsdale Pala Casino Spa Resort The Linq Hotel And Casino Casino Games For Android Bitco</h1>

<p>On 9/15, I played after depositing JPY100000, and as a result, I met all the wagering requirements and had a balance of JPY866500. During that time, I also submitted documents for identity verification and received a notification that my account was verified. Furthermore, in order to match the withdrawal method and the deposit method, I deposited JPY 10000 from ecopayz and cleared the wagering requirement (JPY 30000) for that deposit as well.</p>
<p>After that, I proceeded to withdraw and tried to withdraw to ecopayz, but all were rejected. The response from customer support is slow, and the response from Japanese support has already been unanswered for more than 5 days. I got a reply only once. At that time, the content was "Please reply to this email address (Bao Casino support address) instead of English support." However, the reason for refusal of withdrawal to ecopayz will not be disclosed. Also, the English support responded, but they said, "Since withdrawing this amount to ecopayz is risky, I would like to handle it by bank transfer." I gave my bank account information. However, it's already been two days without a reply to that email. Even if I inquire by chat, I am told that "I will reply by email", but I do not receive an email. Finally, I was unable to login to my account. Now I am asking about the reason on the chat, but they only say "I will reply by email" and I still don't know the reason. I'm having a hard time withdrawing my hard-earned winnings.</p>
