<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Novomatic history: a king of European gambling goes online</p>
<p>Novomatic was one of the first providers who entered the online gambling industry at its dawn, but its path stretches far beyond the late 90s. Unlike the current niche leaders such as Microgaming or Playtech, the global success of Novomatic software takes its roots in the land-based casino segment.</p>
<p>The brand has also a fascinating story behind. Johann Graf, an Austrian man from modest backgrounds, initially started to earn his living as a butcher apprentice. He was supposed to be the future owner of the family’s butcher shop. No one had foreseen that this person will run his own gambling empire called Novomatic.</p>
<p>So how had his story begin? He decided to branch out it 1974 and started a business Brodnik &amp; Graf together with his partner Gerhard Brodnik. They were producing pinball machines at first, but later Brodnik left the company. After that, Graf switched to slot machines manufacturing under the name Admiral as part of his new-born Novomatic company.</p>
<p>That happened in 1980 and since then Novomatic slots very quickly expanded outside Austria. First markets to enter were German, Dutch, Swiss, and French.</p>
<p>During the 80s, Novomatic already became well-known for several tech innovations. Those included the development of Micro Processor Unit 01 and the creation of the legendary Novomatic American Poker II game.</p>
<p>In the 90s, Novomatic grew even more and established branches in more than 30 countries. They also developed multiplayer devices and released Novomatic TouchBet® Live-Roulette technology, which allowed to automate roulette and embrace up to 250 players in one live gaming session.</p>
<p>Note: Don’t confuse this technology with live roulette online casinos, which feature a live dealer and a video stream accessible through the web. Novomatic electronic roulette is a ground-standing machine where the player can place bets via the touch screen. Most of these Novomatic machines also support blackjack, keno, baccarat, and some more games.</p>
<p>In the 00s, Novomatic continued to drive innovation into the land-based casino industry and introduced a number of new products: Novo Multi-Table Roulette, NOVO Unity, Novo Multi-Wheel Roulette, and Multi-Gaminator. What’s even more interesting, the brand started to work together with another gambling giant, IGT, as part of international ticket-in/ticket-out license agreement.</p>
<p>And finally in the 10s, Novomatic kept penetrating new markets and releasing new products. For example, they developed Novomatic Biometric Systems™ that made them the first provider with a biometrically supported registration. Also, they broke several industry records and achieved multiple awards. The most prominent among them is the recent "Casino Supplier of the Year" award at the GGA in London.</p>
<p>Novomatic as a land-based casino owner</p>
<p>Novomatic owns dozens of brick-and-mortar casinos, most notable of which are:</p>
<p>Frankfurt Airport casino, Germany’s first airport casino;</p>
<p>Casino Admiral Montreux in Switzerland, the first casino opened by the company;</p>
<p>Casino Admiral in Budapest, Hungary;</p>
<p>Casino ADMIRAL Colosseum in Haté, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Despite huge success with its land-based venues, the company is not as groundbreaking in the online casino industry. Still, Novomatic casino games and software are definitely worth discussing.</p>
<p>Novomatic online casino games and software</p>
<p>Some of the best slots you’ll probably recognize from the casino floors are Novomatic games. For example, those could be Novomatic most popular slots like Book of Ra, Lucky Lady’s Charm, or Dolphin’s Pearl. An average RTP of a typical Novomatic slot machine ranges between 94 and 95%.</p>
<p>Novomatic focus has a great focus on slot machines, offering more than 50 of them to play at Novomatic casino sites. Alongside these, there are some table and skill-based games on the list, including a handful of roulette and card games. The total number of browser-based Novomatic casino games is about to reach more than a hundred titles.</p>
<p>Note: Many Novomatic slots have a ‘gamble’ feature with which you can multiply winnings by guessing a color of the card (black or red). Players can choose to collect their win at any point or to carry on gambling.</p>
<p>The most popular Novomatic slots like Book of Ra and Sizzling Hot have mobile versions, but not many online casinos offer them to date. So if you want something more mobile-friendly, we suggest you look towards games from Play’n Go, NetEnt, and Evolution Gaming.</p>
<p>Novomatic software solutions</p>
<p>Novomatic slot machines and casino cabinets are placed in numerous casinos across Europe. As for online gambling, Novomatic casino software is particularly popular for gamblers looking to play their favorite land-based casino games online.</p>
