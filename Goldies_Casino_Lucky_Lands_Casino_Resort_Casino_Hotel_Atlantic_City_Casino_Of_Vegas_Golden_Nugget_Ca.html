<p>Hello Nick!</p>
<p>Sorry for delay.</p>
<p>As I remember I uploaded ID and selfie and it was verified. I make this note, because my account was deactivated and i cant check real status about this documents.</p>
<p>After that i uploaded Bank statement as proof of address. They dont accept pdf file, so i converted it like jpg in 6 separate page. They didn't approve because no my name on it but it's the same document, just different pages. My bank don't put name on every page. They contact me about this case and i answered just like here, to you. They still required bank statement with name on every page, and didnt accept my zoom pdf screenshot (idea that my bank didnt write name on every page but they wanted).</p>
<p>So, after, they required bank statement again, source of income and also statement from Netteler account with all incoming and outgoing transactions for the last 3 months. I uploaded source of income of the funds used for making deposits. It was neteller screenshot with huge winnings on Digimedia. They canceled my withdraw several time, and after they asked about brief clarification regarding the transaction. This transaction was made for exchange my neteller funds on crypto - they got same clarification, as you.</p>
<p>After they said "Our security department has identified activity in your account, which is considered as fraud" and close my account!!</p>
<p>Of course, they often ignored me, and I had to write several emails per day in order to be heard.</p>
<p>Wait for your feedback</p>
