<p>The Netherlands has been one of the most tightly regulated markets in Europe. Since it launched in October 2021, the Dutch iGaming and betting market has been introducing new consumer-protection measures but has still seen itself grow.</p>
<p>Even today, on the occasion of the Fourth Monitoring Report on Online Games of Chace conducted by the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the country’s regulator, the projections are that the market will expand with an additional 13%-15% year per year. The market itself already numbers some 859,000 players who have registered with legal providers.</p>
<p>This means that the maturity date is a long way off for iGaming in the Netherlands, with the results generated in January 2023 hitting €124m in gross gaming results, compared to €90m in January 2022. Commenting on the latest data about the market, KSA Chairman René Jansen said that the online casino games market has continued to grow, in line with the regulator’s expectations.</p>
<p>This, though, requires competent authorities to be ever more vigilant about changes in the market make-up, and reminded providers of games of chance that they had a non-negotiable commitment to providing players with a safe betting and gaming environment. Jansen said that the regulator remains firmly committed to implementing the so-called duty of care which is what operators should aspire to introduce as part of their products.</p>
<p>Together with providers, the regulator may protect the market and ensure that there is a clear interpretation of player protection measures. Speaking of players, there are 859,000 people who have already registered with licensed operators, that is entities that have been officially regulated by the Dutch gaming authority. The large number is no reason for concern, assures the KSA, as the actual number of active monthly players is actually much smaller, at some 365,000 players per month.</p>
<p>The regulator explains that 57% of all players only own a single account, but 22% of all players may in fact own four or more accounts. This second cohort of players is usually looking for the best games and bonuses and prefers to keep several accounts running. Although the channelization is very high, the good news is that the majority of players are playing with the regulated market. Young adults usually have 2.6 accounts per player.</p>
<p>Even though players are registering in greater numbers, they are losing a lot less. For example, between October 2021 and July 2022, an average player lost €153, but this amount has changed to €143 between August 2022 and January 2023. Young adults also tend to lose much less compared to older players, with the average net loss per young adult standing at €54.</p>
<p>The Fourth Report comes ahead of a planned new total ban on untargeted advertisement of gambling products in the country that is due to roll out on July 1, 2023.</p>
