    <h1>Rhythm City Casino Davenport Iowa Winstar Online Casino Upper Peninsula Casinos Casino Slot Machine</h1>

<p>Dear silverhank77,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos take KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>The casino is not asking for anything unusual, the vast majority of online casinos need to verify the deposit method to ensure that it belongs to a specific player. Moreover, we personally often suggest a Skype call to verify the player's identity.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you discuss the issue of the lost card with the casino and what are your alternative options. Somehow there must be a way to verify your deposits as they didn't just appear in your account out of nowhere and the casino here is the best subject to guide you through this. Then fully cooperate and provide all the requested information as soon as possible and please, keep me updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
