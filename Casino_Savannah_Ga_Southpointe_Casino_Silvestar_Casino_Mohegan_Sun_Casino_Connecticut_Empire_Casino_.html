    <h1>Casino Savannah Ga Southpointe Casino Silvestar Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Connecticut Empire Casino</h1>

<p>hall oils,</p>
<p>my question; I really like playing roulette, I've already been able to win, but: is it better to play this <em>live</em> in the online casino, or is it better to use the table games?</p>
<p>I address those players who mainly play roulette like me with at least 10 years of experience.</p>
<p>FYI: I play occasionally but regularly (for 20 years) and NEVER exceed my budget!</p>
<p>If a month is unsuccessful - I'll keep my hands off it.</p>
<p>I have disciplined myself under control.</p>
<p>Many try to recover a loss <em>quickly</em> by doubling ect.....no chance in my experience...casinos record game sessions, you should stop when you have a bigger win - and wait at least 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>Habs tried - several times with MINI inserts or large inserts.</p>
<p>Even if you just go in with 10 EUROS (stake 0.10 cents) they quickly gamble away.</p>
<p>This requires patience and strategy when building.</p>
<p>With <em>live</em> I noticed - since it can happen after a win - that you don't hit a single number! Like <em>they</em> are watching you!!</p>
<p>Also, NEVER stay at the table for more than an hour - because of the IP address!</p>
<p>Thanks for the answers about your personal experiences ðŸ™‚</p>
