<p>Sports betting brand operating in the Baltics Olybet announced a deal with Real Betis to become an official partner of the soccer club from the Spanish province of Andalusia in the Baltics, covering Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p>
<p>More Opportunities for Fans</p>
<p>The partnership with Olybet comes just days after Real Betis beat Valencia 5-4 after penalties at the Copa del Rey final to win the trophy for the first time since 2005 and the collaboration will look to link fans in the Baltic region with the club.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the winners of the Copa del Rey trophy. Real Betis is a great team with a successful history and very passionate supporters.” Corey Plummer, Chairman and CEO, Olympic Entertainment Group and OlyBet Group</p>
<p>For Plummer, the collaboration means more opportunities for the fans to engage with the football club as Olybet will utilize a variety of means to engage with the fans, including live broadcasts, local events, and media campaigns across social media to provide them with “unique experiences.”</p>
<p>Plummer also outlined that the agreements Olybet signed last year with professional sports leagues such as the NHL and NBA, sports clubs such as AC Fiorentina from Serie A and sports personalities such as Real Madrid playmaker Luca Modric served as a display of the operator’s growing status and “have laid a solid foundation” for the brand’s position in Europe.</p>
<p>Expanding Global Reach and Popularity</p>
<p>“Partnering with OlyBet, the top sports betting brand in the region, provides a larger scale of digital platforms to engage fans and players and develop professional football as a great sports show.” Ramon Alarcon, Business General Manager, Real Betis</p>
<p>Founded in 1907, Real Betis won the league title in 1935 and Copa del Rey and 1997 and 2005, and the latest triumph last week was the third for the club in the tournament and its fourth domestic trophy in its history. During all those years, the club experienced relegation into the second echelon many times, explaining why the club’s motto is ‘Long Live Betis even When They Lose.’</p>
<p>The agreement with Olybet for the Baltics is the latest in a trend of sports clubs teaming with sports betting operators in other markets, following the ban on such partnerships for local markets.</p>
<p>The new regulation also placed restrictions on gambling advertising during certain times of the day, besides the ban on betting shirt sponsorship deals while allowing existing deals to run until the end of the 2021-22 season.</p>
