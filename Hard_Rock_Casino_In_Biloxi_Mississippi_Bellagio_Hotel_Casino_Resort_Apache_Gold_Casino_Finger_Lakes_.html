<p>Hub88 will leverage the newly-released solution to make payments a breeze for its international clients</p>
<p>Platform provider Hub88 unveiled HubWallet, a proprietary payment solution that leverages the company’s robust back office. The new product is expected to make payments easier, safer and more intuitive.</p>
<p>Hub88 Launches In-House Payment Solution</p>
<p>Hub88 is best known for aggregating iGaming content, which makes the launch of HubWallet an unprecedented one. The unique solution will make payments simpler for clients, allowing them to leverage a multi-faceted platform to pay directly.</p>
<p>The online wallet is built upon Hub88’s significant experience in both business-to-business and business-to-customer operations. The company’s dedication to quality is reflected in the new solution, which improves payment options for operators within the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The platform provider built its new online wallet solution in a way that makes payments faster, eliminating unnecessary steps such as manual invoicing and fee processing. Furthermore, the new solution has a built-in low-cost currency exchange, which makes it easier to be used by operators in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>HubWallet is a highly-automated solution that also provides Hub88’s clients with complete banking support, ensuring safe and reliable international and domestic payments. As part of the launch, Hub88 will also provide its clients with access to the HubWallet Marketplace.</p>
<p>Hub88 noted that in order to support its new online wallet, the company has augmented its back-office with legal addendums, social logins and game certificates. This will reinforce the system’s capabilities while boosting its famous lightweight aggregation platform at the same time.</p>
<p>Castleman Is Happy about the Launch</p>
<p>Hub88’s head, Ollie Castleman, commented on the launch of HubWallet. He noted that he is happy to expand the company’s offering with what he called a “ground-breaking product.” Castelman noted that HubWallet seeks to reinvent payment options in gaming, allowing the company’s partners to make payments quickly and safely.</p>
<p>Castleman added that the new launch evolves Hub88 as a company.</p>
<p>With the new launch, we’ve evolved the Hub88 brand, as its brilliant integration services are now supported by a state-of-the-art payment system, making Hub88 a more comprehensive and expansive platform provider. Ollie Castleman, Head of Hub88</p>
<p>Hub88 used the announcement as an opportunity to remind industry enthusiasts that it will be present at ICE London. The company will exhibit at the Bombay Group stand under the number N8-219.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Hub88 penned a major content distribution agreement with Livespins, adding the latter company’s socially-charged casino content to its aggregation platform. A month earlier, Hub88 also teamed up with Nexiux Solutions, an innovative, agile and dynamic iGaming tech company.</p>
