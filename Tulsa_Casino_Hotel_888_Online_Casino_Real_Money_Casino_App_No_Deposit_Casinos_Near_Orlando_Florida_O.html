<p>Maverick Gaming is proud of its ongoing investment in local communities and jobs across Washington, CEO Persson said</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming, a company that develops, owns, and operates top-notch hotels with gaming facilities, has reinforced its portfolio with another property. As announced, the operator acquired the All-Star Lanes &amp; Casino in Silverdale, Washington, further expanding Maverick Gaming’s footprint in the state.</p>
<p>All-Star Lanes &amp; Casino is an entertainment venue that offers a variety of engagement options to its visitors. The property boasts a variety of gaming and poker tables for gambling enthusiasts, as well as 40 lanes of bowling. Video game enthusiasts can visit the arcade and play one of the many games available. After a long day of gaming and gambling, visitors can have a coffee or dinner at one of All-Star’s dining options.</p>
<p>All-Star, as a company, was founded in 1985. It currently fields more than 150 employees. Thanks to its popularity, the venue will be a valuable addition to Maverick Gaming’s portfolio.</p>
<p>All-Star will be Maverick Gaming’s 23rd card room in the state of Washington. The latter company currently operates a number of brands and properties across Nevada, Colorado and Washington.</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming Is Excited to Expand in Washington</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming’s chief executive officer and majority owner, Eric Persson, said that his team is proud to invest in Washington and grow its presence in the State. He added that his team hopes to establish a lasting relationship with Silverdale’s community and create many new jobs for the locals.</p>
<p>Maverick Gaming is proud of its ongoing investment in local communities and jobs across our state. We all look forward to building partnerships with the community of Silverdale, supporting family wage jobs and investing in a great local entertainment center. Eric Persson, CEO, Maverick Gaming</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Maverick Gaming and Bally’s Corporation joined forces at Tropicana Las Vegas. Under the agreement between the two gambling powerhouses, the former party established a Maverick Gaming Poker Room at the Tropicana.</p>
<p>The new facility was designed to appeal to new and seasoned poker players alike and channel customers toward Bally’s LV property. Back then, Persson agreed to participate in Bally’s Big Bet Poker, generating extra hype for the new facility.</p>
<p>In May, Maverick Gaming picked PayNearMe’s MoneyLine product to bring the most comprehensive payment experience to consumers. The best-in-class payment solution helped the operator change the game and make payments more intuitive for players.</p>
<p>Last year, Maverick Gaming finalized its huge $80.5 million dollar acquisition of Evergreen Gaming.</p>
