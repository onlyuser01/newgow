    <h1>Bally S Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casinos In South Carolina Soaring Eagle Online Casino Free Slot Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, my account was suddenly blocked after making a second deposit. They told me I needed to verify my identity. That was fine, no problem. However, I couldn't do this directly on the casino's website. I contacted support and they told me to email a copy of my ID (both sides) to a specific email address. The email address they gave me was wrong, which I only found out a few days later when I got a reply (on 03.07). I contacted support again, and this time I got the correct email (12.07). Three days later, they reply, insisting that I verify my identity on the casino's website - which, from the beginning, has been impossible. I sent a screenshot. No response.</p>
<p>I then wrote to support again, and they told me they needed a selfie, which I should send to the address they had allegedly written to me. But I didn't receive any such email. So, I sent the requested selfie (on 23.07). To date, no response and my account is still blocked. I've written to support several times but I keep getting the same reply: wait for support to contact me.</p>
<p>In the only email I've received from support, it says processing and replying should take 3-5 working days. Well, I've been waiting almost 20 days now. When I asked them to just refund my last deposit because I no longer wish to play, I don't get a response - just the same message, that I should wait.</p>
