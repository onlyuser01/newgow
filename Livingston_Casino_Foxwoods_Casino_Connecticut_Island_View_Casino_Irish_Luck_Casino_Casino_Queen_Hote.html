<p>EveryMatrix has released its first quarter update, demonstrating robust performance across all of the company’s divisions, including casino, sports, and platform. The quarter was marked by several important developments, including the company’s biggest-ever platform migration project, a number of important partnerships with leading suppliers and more.</p>
<p>The period ended on March 31 and saw the company record a net revenue of €23.5m, constituting a 69% jump year-over-year and a 21% increase quarter-over-quarter, making it a record-setting three-month period. EveryMatrix similarly stated that this has been the sixth consecutive quarter of sustained growth.</p>
<p>EBITDA inched up to €10.5m and gained 119% year-over-year. The company reported a record quarterly gross gaming revenue for partner operators in the casino vertical, posting a total of €374m, a 77% year-over-year gain in the results. This success was overshadowed by the turnover collected by the sports business division which stood at €991m, or a 210% gain year-over-year.</p>
<p>Commenting on these results, EveryMatrix CEO Ebbe Groes hailed the results and the people who have made the present results possible. The quarter-over-quarter growth has been a strong indicator for the company across all of its businesses, with Groes outlining what was next for the company as well:</p>
<p>"This year is all about delivering and going above and beyond for our global customers. We have several large-scale projects underway including a successful platform migration and new look sportsbook for bet-at-home, with Germany to come shortly, and the launch of the Hungarian lottery’s new digital sports offering later this year."</p>
<p>Groes hailed the milestones and partnerships achieved over the past several months, speaking highly of the omnichannel agreements negotiated and the new gamification features introduced, all a precursor to the company’s future success. Meanwhile, casino and sports net revenue made steady gains with €10.8m and €5.9m respectively.</p>
<p>The platform vertical saw a net revenue increase of 97% year-over-year. The company update also outlined what it considered important updates and partnerships, including the launch of the EveryMatrix platform and tech stack with bet-at-home.com. An extension of the services to the German domain name is on track for Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The company also entered into a partnership with a tier-one operator in Croatia over the first quarter, and received license approval in Connecticut, a fifth state for the company in the US. EveryMatrix’s President of Americas, Eryk Nyman, similarly confirmed that the company is poised for further iGaming growth and success in the US and beyond.</p>
