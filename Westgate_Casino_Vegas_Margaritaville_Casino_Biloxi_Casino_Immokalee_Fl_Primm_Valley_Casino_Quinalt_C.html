<p>888 Poker Traffic: Busy Cash Games</p>
<p>888 Poker traffic guarantees that you will have tons to do and always be able to keep playing your favorite cash games, satellite events, weekday, or weekend tournaments. The poker room has tons going on, and this is all owing to the high traffic it accumulates. In 2020, 888 Poker reported a 60% increase in its United States operations.</p>
<p>The company’s growth has been remarkable all throughout recent years, with revenue increasing by 45% year-over-year for 2020. More importantly, this has translated into higher tournament and cash game traffic, and a series of events and tournaments that allow poker players to always find something to do.</p>
<p>Tournament tickets are readily available and buy-ins allow players to continue contributing to 888 Poker’s traffic numbers. 888 Poker runs different networks, but the number of players remains high.</p>
<p>On most weeks, the poker room will see an average of 1,500 cash games, but in the United Kingdom, this number may peak at 8,000 players and thousands of games.</p>
<p>888 Poker Games and Software</p>
<p>To deliver on its benchmark-quality, 888 Poker has invested a lot of time and effort to harness the best software practices and develop online poker software that allows players to benefit from the best possible experience. The card room works well on any desktop or mobile device and has a dedicated download client as well as a mobile app.</p>
<p>Overall, players will benefit from a flexible poker room that allows you to experience poker in any format and setting you to prefer. The desktop and mobile software are intuitive and equally powerful, guaranteeing a flawless real money online poker experience.</p>
<p>888 has repeatedly optimized the mobile app thanks to HTML5, allowing it to play from any possible medium and have a blast. The software is powerful enough to support multi-table cash games and multi-table tournaments without any risk of crashing.</p>
<p>In fact, 888 is one of the brands that have experienced the fewest technical issues in online poker, compared to other established household names such as partypoker and PokerStars. It’s safe to say that the poker software is 888 Holdings’ flagship product.</p>
<p>What Poker Games Can You Play</p>
<p>888 features some of the best poker games out there. The card room has coined its own unique variations, such as the BLAST Sit &amp; Go’s and Fast-Fold Poker. These unique games add to the variety and allow players to experience product beyond the traditional options, which include but aren’t limited to:</p>
<p>Texas Hold’em</p>
<p>Omaha</p>
<p>Omaha Hi-Lo</p>
<p>7 Card Stud</p>
<p>SNAP</p>
<p>New 888 Poker games are quite popular. In fact, 888 makes it very easy to play the games you specifically want to try. The majority of the action will focus on Texas Hold’em as the quintessential tournament game, but there are plenty of other options to enjoy.</p>
<p>You will find plenty of like-minded individuals who prefer Omaha or even 7 Card Stud or opt straight for SNAP. For the more competitive formats, though, you will have to stick to Hold’em, which is brilliant.</p>
<p>A player who enjoys playing for big prizes and against a competitive field, 888 Poker’s selection of games is definitely up to the expected standard. Apart from the powerful software that makes it all possible, you get to benefit from some pretty flexible buy-ins and table limits.</p>
<p>No-Limit Hold’em and Fixed-Limit Hold’em will begin at $0.01/$0.02 and $0.02/$0.04 respectively and go all the way up to $500/$1,000 and $50/$100. Table limits tend to change quite quickly, so it’s best to just keep an eye out yourself.</p>
<p>Bonuses and Promotions at 888 Poker</p>
<p>If you are looking for sizeable promotions, free cash, or good value on tournament tickets, 888 Poker has this and more to offer. The card room will have tons of bonuses to run by you, and you will always stand to benefit from something worthwhile. 888 Poker has a bit of everything to offer in the promo department, and all offers have real money value. You get to choose and benefit from:</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Invite a Friend</p>
<p>No Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>The last time we checked, 888 Poker had a very cool $88 no deposit bonus to power up the experience if you are a new player. You can benefit from this and the welcome deposit bonus that adds solid cash to play with.</p>
<p>The size of the deposit sign-up offer will change quite often depending on the location you are accessing 888 Poker from. Never mind the small fluctuations in the value of the bonus, though, players from all around the world will have access to some excellent promotions. Apart from the no deposit and sign-up offer, 888 Poker has plenty more to offer.</p>
<p>Invite a Friend Today at 888 Poker</p>
<p>Making your friends part of the 888 Poker experience has its upsides. You will be able to scoop up a $15 bonus for every friend you recruit. More importantly, you will be able to participate in the card room’s dedicated Play with Friends imitative. Recruiting friends is easy, and you can share a unique link with your mates via WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, or just send the link via any other communication medium you and your friends use.</p>
<p>Hot Offers and Ongoing Promotions</p>
<p>888 Poker has a bagful of promotions to extend. The poker room will offer players a ton of ongoing promotions and a way to secure new prizes. The site presently runs a variety of bonuses, including Hand of the Day, Early Bird Rakeback, and Play with Friends to name a few.</p>
<p>Players may be entitled to slightly different real money promos depending on their location, so always keep this in mind. Thankfully, the online poker room makes it very easy for you to have a quick look at the available offers and pick those that benefit you the most.</p>
<p>Outside the welcome deposit bonus and no deposit option, though, the other big draw for most poker players will be the tournaments. The site has tons of excellent tournaments to offer and affordable tournament tickets to complement this. Speaking of, let’s take a look at how you can play in a tournament and what tournaments are in fact available to you!</p>
<p>888 Poker Tournaments</p>
<p>When it comes to tournaments, 888 Poker has them all. The card room has gone above and beyond to shape a tournament ecosystem that allows any new player and frequent fliers to have a blast. With powerful software to underpin this experience, you are looking at tons of great options. 888 Poker is constantly adding to its tournament list, but it’s very easy to keep track of if you follow our poker news.</p>
<p>One of the end-of-year worthwhile events in 2020 was the $1M XL Winter Series, featuring a $500K Main Event. Apart from these episodic tournaments, though there are plenty of actual events that are baked into the very fabric of the site. If you are looking for a bit of tourney action, you will get in any of the available formats, including:</p>
<p>Sit and Go</p>
<p>Multi-table Tournaments (MTT)</p>
<p>Progressive Knockouts</p>
<p>Multi Fight</p>
<p>Free Tournaments</p>
<p>Satellite Tournaments</p>
<p>Deep Stack</p>
<p>Each of the available tourney options is quite exciting. Tournament tickets can be usually bought straight-up or you can choose to participate in some of the satellite events, which often allow you to gain an entry without spending too much cash.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the most successful poker players have won seven-figure prizes by participating in a satellite tournament with as little as $1-$20. 888 Poker gives you every opportunity to repeat this success story, whether you are a new player or a poker veteran. In fact, as Maria Ho recently said, “I think the most beautiful part of poker is that on any given day, a complete amateur can step into the arena with the titans of the game, and beat them.”</p>
<p>Running Huge Tournament Prizes</p>
<p>888 Poker runs some of the most flexible poker tables players will find online. Better yet, though, the tournament structures are packed with seven-figure prizes, making it easy for veterans and novices to find a worthwhile promotion.</p>
<p>The tournament structure for each event is different, but 888 is in the habit of running excellent weekday and weekend competitions that offer sizeable promotions. If you are looking for a less rigid tournament structure, you can try BLAST Sit &amp; Go’s.</p>
<p>The buy-in is available at as little as $0.10 for a chance to hit a 10,000 multiplier and share in the $1,000 multiplier. For the major events, you will be able to catch yourself up by flicking through the dedicated tourney tab and scooping up tournament tickets for affordable rates.</p>
<p>Can You Get Free Tournament Tickets?</p>
<p>Free tournament tickets are another bread-and-butter available at 888 Poker. Players are entitled to get bonus tickets and then use those in the company’s special free tournaments. You can enter these events without covering any buy-in, but still benefit from real money prizes and awards.</p>
<p>Once you get free entries, you can use them on the special tournaments that use a special structure allowing players to join even more challenging events and potentially make it into bigger events for serious prizes.</p>
<p>888 Poker: Mobile vs Desktop Software</p>
<p>Thanks to its unique functionality, the 888 Poker software is quite flexible, making sure that players will have access to plenty of real money games, tournament tickets, and more. 888 Holdings has decided to invest in the software, and the latest platform overhaul was very recently, in 2020 in fact.</p>
<p>The poker room launched its newest mobile and desktop platform, Poker8, and revealed its new motto, ‘Made to Play,‘ celebrating by distributing $1 million in gift drops. Your account is enough to allow you to access every facet of the site, whether this is the app, browser version, or desktop client.</p>
<p>888 Poker Mobile App</p>
<p>The mobile app is quite fun and powerful. 888 will allow you to take the poker experience with you and play from anywhere, at any time. Moreover, you will enjoy the best poker games available and still have all features of the offer available.</p>
<p>A player who is constantly on the go can definitely appreciate the 888 Poker mobile app, as it covers both iPhone and Android devices, and grants full access to all cash games and tournaments. This features bonus access and great games on tap available at $0.01/$0.02.</p>
<p>888 Poker Desktop Download</p>
<p>With years on the market, 888 Poker has catered to every vertical, providing players with unique poker experiences. The website’s desktop platform makes sure that you can immerse in a dedicated experience from any set-up, whether you prefer Windows or Mac.</p>
<p>Players are equally welcome to try and play directly in their browser, allowing for a quick in and out of any game. If you prefer to play in a slightly more dedicated environment, though, the dedicated software clients may be just the right thing for you.</p>
<p>Download and installation are easy and 888 Poker has a number of manuals to make everything quite easy.</p>
<p>Deposit and Withdrawal at 888 Poker</p>
<p>Once you have an account, 888 Poker will make the rest of the journey easy for you. Everything from claiming a deposit bonus to buying tournament tickets is straightforward. This brings us to the available payment options. 888 has a tailored approach to each jurisdiction the company operates in, so you can expect the deposit methods to vary a little across countries.</p>
<p>Popular deposit banking options players may benefit from include bank cards, e-wallets, mobile payment solutions, and direct banking methods. This includes all the most popular deposit methods, including VISA, MasterCard, ecoPayz, Neteller, PayPal, Skrill, and Trustly, Instadebit, and more.</p>
<p>Some payment options will be restricted as deposit only, but this is okay. AstroPay Card, Apple Pay, and Interac Online are just some of the payment providers 888 Poker teams up with to make it easy to cash in and out.</p>
<p>888 Poker Deposit Limits</p>
<p>888 Poker has a low deposit limit, making it simple and undemanding for players to make an entry into the world of online poker. All payment methods allow you to deposit $10 to fund your account and starting playing any of the available games. You can choose a cash game, fast-fold poker, Omaha, Texas, 7 Stud, Blast, Snap, and more. To check out what specific maximum deposit limits apply, please refer to the cashier section.</p>
<p>Cashing out with 888 Poker</p>
<p>To withdraw, your winnings, you will have plenty of options to go on. 888 Poker features popular international payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, Skrill, Neteller, PayPal, and Wire Transfers. Each method is available for as little as $10, except for Wire Transfers where you need to request at least $25 to cash out.</p>
<p>Your maximum withdrawal limits will depend on your status within the platform. The more you play, the higher the cash out limit will become. For Wire Transfers, though, you will have a flat $50,000 limit, and big tournament winnings are usually cashed out in several installments.</p>
<p>Players have had no complaints about the website’s banking section and 888 Poker itself is a benchmark for how a card room should treat players.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Customer support was a bit of a weak point for 888 Poker looking a few years back. Yet, the card room has learned its lesson and has adopted a much more customer-focused approach. Players can get in touch quickly in customer support using an email form on the site but we had the best results calling directly using the numbers listed on their contact page.</p>
<p>Most players are somewhat dissatisfied with the lack of direct e-mail support, and some have reported that it takes days to receive an answer. In our experience, though, it only takes a few hours. While e-mail is not ideal, 888 Poker has been able to keep its support team up to scratch.</p>
<p>The mobile app is also equipped with a quick support button so you can browse through and make an inquiry quickly. Another strong aspect of the experience is that you can benefit from a comprehensive FAQ section covering everything from your deposit bonus to gift drops, the mobile app, player account, tournament prizes, tickets, and more.</p>
<p>888 Poker Complaints</p>
<p>888 Poker is riding a wave of negative reviews of late with TrustPilot. After sampling close to 350 reviews, we have confirmed that most of the claims lacked substance. In their majority, the users failed to provide any evidence of the problem they stated, reporting “rigging.”</p>
<p>Some users insisted that they had been lured with “big bonuses,” but the site’s structure allows for a no deposit bonus and a fairly small welcome bonus by poker standards, with the majority of promotions really only pertaining to tickets, gift drops, and games, which are free to join in.</p>
<p>While it’s good to keep these in mind, 888 Poker has not shown anything to suggest foul play when we were testing it and the website still ranks very high by poker and community standards, pulling a substantial player based and reporting little to no technical difficulties in crunch times.</p>
<p>Reddit 888 Poker review</p>
<p>Is 888 Poker worth your while? It seems the best place to find an answer to this question is Reddit and specifically what players on the /poker sub-Reddit have to say. We tend to trust a Reddit review a little more than Trustpilot because it offers more transparency in the sense you can always check the players posting an opinion and see what their publishing history is.</p>
<p>In contrast, TrustPilot often has users who register with the sole purpose of bashing a brand. One review published by InvizableShadow in 2018 stated:</p>
<p>“I have played here for 10+ years. It’s always been relatively soft and I have always thought of this site as small stakes, but profitable place to play.”</p>
<p>Another positive review states that 888 Poker makes things easier than PokerStars in many ways. The addition of BLAST, SNAP, and Fast-Fold poker have been major boons to the platform, too. A player going by the name of RegiTime added this:</p>
<p>“Everything is easier on 888 apart from reaching customer service and withdrawal times. Cash games are softer, MTT’s are easier to win due to softer players and smaller fields, SNG’s are softer.”</p>
<p>Some reviews highlight the weakness of the previous software as well as the slow customer service. However, they are a little dated to be able to tell for sure, so keep this in mind or feel free to start a fresh discussion.</p>
<p>888 Poker Verdict</p>
<p>888 Poker is a worthwhile website for you to visit and definitely a great pick if you are based in a jurisdiction where the brand operates. There is a lot to do at 888 Poker, starting with the games, tournaments, frequent tournaments, and big seasonal showdowns.</p>
<p>888 is an official partner platform to the World Series of Poker (WSOP) giving you yet another reason to explore the offer in full. If you are looking for an online poker room where the prize pool options are great and the traffic is enough to allow you 24/7 action, 888 Poker is what you are after.</p>
