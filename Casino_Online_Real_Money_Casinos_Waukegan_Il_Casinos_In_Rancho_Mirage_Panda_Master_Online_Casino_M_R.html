<p>The fast-growing iGaming provider released information about three new upcoming network promotions set to round off the final months of the year</p>
<p>The innovative provider of games and solutions, powering the online gambling vertical, Wazdan, unveiled details regarding upcoming promotions planned throughout the end of this year. On Friday, the company revealed that its promotions will offer a mouthwatering €2,500,000 ($2.8 million) prize pool, elevating the thrill and excitement for the players.</p>
<p>Wazdan explained that the promotions will be run on the Mystery Drop promo tool, which was recently recognized with an award for its effectiveness and innovation within the gambling industry. According to the innovative games provider, the three new promotions will be available for its entire portfolio of aggregators and partners, delivering unrivaled thrills and experiences.</p>
<p>Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, explained that it is exciting to deliver an additional batch of network promotions for the company’s operators and players. “With the help of our award-winning Mystery Drop and coinciding with the Halloween and Christmas period, there are three exciting new network promotions to look forward to that will help our partners drive traffic and round off a successful year,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure to bring our final batch of network promotions of the year to our operators and players.“ Andrzej Hyla, chief commercial officer at Wazdan</p>
<p>Additional details released by Wazdan reveal that the first new network promotion will be Mystery Fall, set to run between September 15 and October 15. Then, the company will launch its HalloWIN Drop promotion, which will run between October 23 and November 19. Finally, the Xmas Drop promotion will start on November 27 and run through December 26, 2023, delivering thrilling experiences for the players just in time for the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>The Thrilling Network Promotions Boost Customer Engagement</p>
<p>The engaging network promotions from Wazdan have shown excellent results in providing a boost for operators’ visibility. At the same time, the promotions are proven to improve customer engagement and retention. Currently, Wazdan offers a dedicated account manager and ready-to-use graphics, as well as marketing materials for its partners, allowing seamless access to the network promotions.</p>
<p>The upcoming network promotions come after Wazdan organized multiple other engaging promotions earlier this year. Gods Cash, Chinese New Year, Wazdan Breaks the Rules and Easter Drop helped deliver thrilling experiences, bringing the combined prize pool of the year close to €4 million ($4.5 million).</p>
