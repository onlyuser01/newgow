<p>Christmas Crash is Evoplay’s way to send 2023 away with a blast, following a multitude of exciting releases</p>
<p>Evoplay has enhanced its product lineup with a new holiday-themed game called Christmas Crash. The new title will see players embark on a journey across the skies together with Santa and is one of many exciting games gambling aficionados can experience this season.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, Christmas Crash is a crash game in which players must cash out on time to win prizes. Players can place their wagers before Santa flies off, preparing for his journey on the way to deliver gifts. Once Santa soars, the multiplier will start increasing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Santa’s mischievous brother seeks to thwart his journey to deliver gifts. As a result, Santa’s sleigh will eventually hit a trap, resetting the multiplier. Players need to cash out their bets before that happens, lest they lose them.</p>
<p>Player engagement is further enhanced by the game’s Two Bets Feature which allows them to place two bets on the same round. Players can pick a different size for each bet and can also cash out each bet separately.</p>
<p>This adds an important decision-making element to Christmas Crash, putting players in charge of their destinies. Players can cash out early or keep on holding if they like taking risks. For reference, the maximum multiplier is 1,000x.</p>
<p>This Is Evoplay’s Final Game for the Year</p>
<p>Between each two rounds, players will get a 10-second period to decide on their next bets. All bets must be placed before Santa recovers from the crash and flies off again. In addition, players must keep in mind that if they cash out at the exact moment the sleigh crashes, the situation will be considered a loss.</p>
<p>Evoplay’s Christmas Crash also sports a top 100 list, allowing players to compete with one another. In addition to that, players can discuss the game in the built-in chatroom.</p>
<p>Christmas Crash is Evoplay’s way to send 2023 away with a blast, following a multitude of exciting releases. The new title follows the launch of exciting new titles such as Northern Temple and Penalty Roulette.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay’s chief executive officer, commented on the new release, confirming that it will be Evoplay’s final title for the year. He also noted that the game’s features will make sure that players enjoy tagging along with Santa’s thrilling escapade.</p>
<p>This crash title exhibits the Two Bets Feature, meaning double the fun for players as they look to collect presents before Santa’s sleigh hits the obstacle. Christmas Crash marks Evoplay’s final game launch of 2023, a breakthrough year for us as we excitedly look forward to 2024. Ivan Kravchuk, CEO, Evoplay</p>
<p>In August, Evoplay launched a new promotional tool with enhanced player rewards.</p>
