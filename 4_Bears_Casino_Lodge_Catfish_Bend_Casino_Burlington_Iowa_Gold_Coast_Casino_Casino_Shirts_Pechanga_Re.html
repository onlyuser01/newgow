<p>Relax Gaming has stolen another march on the iGaming market, with the acclaimed company that creates aggregated and in-house gaming solutions, announcing the rollout of Money Train 4 with StarCasino Italy, which precedes the official global launch of the game that is due on Wednesday, September 20, Casino Guru News learned in a media press release.</p>
<p>This partnership is negotiated with Betsson Group, which is the owner of StarCasino Italy, and which is excited to feature the studio’s title. Money Train 4 is one of the studio’s most acclaimed games that has spawned an entire franchise dedicated to bringing more worthwhile and innovative experiences across the board.</p>
<p>The game’s latest release comes with a 150,000x multiplier, a Respin Feature, and the Money Cart Bonus Round, which are highly coveted and successful. In a recent interview with Relax Gaming Senior GPO Callum Sultana, Casino Guru News learned interesting details about the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Sultana explained how Relax Gaming has focused on creating the best game of the year – every year and how Money Train 4 is part of this. The studio has also increased the number of features and overall look and feel of the title to introduce players to a fresh chapter in the franchise, Callum confirmed in the interview.</p>
<p>StarCasino Italy Managing Director Stefano Tino was excited to welcome the arrival of the new game, arguing that Money Train 4 is what everyone at the operator has been waiting for. "We are filled with pride to be the very first operator to play host to the conclusion of this epic series," Tino said.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard was similarly pleased with the opportunity presented as part of this partnership, with the market in Italy also playing a very important role for the entire company.</p>
<p>"Italy is quickly climbing the ranks of Relax’s top-performing markets so we could not be happier to offer them exclusive access to the release a day early," Attard explained, commenting on the significance of this European market.</p>
<p>Apart from introducing fresh games, Relax Gaming has also been working hard to bring more studio partners into the fold and present players with more worthwhile options. The company recently teamed up with AvatarUX and Endorphina</p>
