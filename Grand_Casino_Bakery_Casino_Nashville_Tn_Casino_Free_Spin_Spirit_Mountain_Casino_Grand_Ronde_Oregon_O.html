<p>Dear schreiter1910,</p>
<p>In response to your verification inquiry, you likely used a third-party card for your deposit, which violates our casino rules, accepted upon registration. Per these rules, complete verification is required before any winnings can be withdrawn. To complete the verification, in addition to some other documents, you should upload some documents we recently asked you about. For your convenience, we re-send this email once again.</p>
<p>Regarding your winnings of â‚¬300.</p>
<p>As we can see in the system, your withdrawal was rejected by our team because you did not pass full verification. After the withdrawal was canceled, the money was returned to your casino balance. From that moment until your next deposit activity you lost the 300 euros. If you wish to receive bets history for this time period, please get in touch with our support via email (support@staycasino.com) or LiveChat, we will gladly assist you with it.</p>
<p>You've mentioned that after the withdrawal was declined and the funds were returned to your account, you didn't place any bets. Given that some of the deposits were made from a third-party card, what is the likelihood that a third party has access to your account? We can see in the system that all logins to your account were made from the same IP address, which means that perhaps some of the people who live in the same house with you could have accessed your account, or it means that only you played on your account.</p>
<p>Also, please do not delete the documents you have uploaded until they are fully verified. As deleted documents cannot be verified by our team.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Stay Casino Team</p>
