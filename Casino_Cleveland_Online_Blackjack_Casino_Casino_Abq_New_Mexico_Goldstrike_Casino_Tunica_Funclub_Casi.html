<p>Spinomenal, an up-and-coming provider of iGaming content, has minted another content agreement, this time with Hollywoodbets, an iGaming and online sports betting company based in Durban.</p>
<p>As agreed, the former party will leverage its portfolio of cutting-edge titles to provide its new South African partner with exciting gaming experiences. The agreement is made possible by Intelligent Gaming, Spinomenal’s local partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership, South African gamblers will get to experience some of the supplier’s best games. Spinomenal’s portfolio is known for its high-quality graphics, superb sound design, exciting gameplay and engaging features.</p>
<p>Some of the games that Hollywoodbets’ players will be able to try out include hits such as Demi Gods III, Queen of Fire and Story of Medusa, among others.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets is a leader in South African gambling, thanks to its diverse selection of online casino offerings and rich variety of sports betting markets. The company has a retail presence, as well as a presence in South Africa’s iGaming sector, making its products very accessible to local customers.</p>
<p>The deal with the African operator follows a recent expansion in Bulgaria that saw the provider team up with Palms Bet and Alphawin. In July, Spinomenal also minted an agreement with Luckia, expanding its presence in Portugal.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets Prides Itself on Providing Exciting Products</p>
<p>Spinomenal’s chief executive officer Lior Shvartz commented on the new partnership, lauding Hollywoodbets as a “leading player” in African gaming. Shvartz said that his team is very excited about the content agreement with the operator and is looking forward to further bolstering its portfolio.</p>
<p>The operator is known for bringing the best entertainment and we know our games will enhance that commitment. Lior Shvartz, CEO, Spinomenal</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hollywoodbets’ head of product Wayde Dorkin said that his team is delighted to welcome Spinomenal’s content on board.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets prides itself on providing its customers with the best and most exciting products that the market has to offer and we feel our clients are going to enjoy the variety of engaging content that Spinomenal offer. Wayde Dorkin, head of product, Hollywoodbets</p>
<p>The two parties also teased their plans to expand their cooperation to the United Kingdom and Ireland later this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spinomenal continues to roll out new content. One of the supplier’s latest releases is Majestic White Rhino, an exciting new slot with many engaging mechanics and free spins.</p>
