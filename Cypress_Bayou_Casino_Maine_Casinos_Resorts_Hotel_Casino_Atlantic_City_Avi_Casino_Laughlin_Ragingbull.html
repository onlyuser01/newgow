    <h1>Cypress Bayou Casino Maine Casinos Resorts Hotel Casino Atlantic City Avi Casino Laughlin Ragingbull</h1>

<p>My name is Roque Junio M<strong><em>*</em>a de S</strong>*a, player at 1xbet 470279037.</p>
<p>Recently, after several bets, the house asked me for a photo of personal documentation along with the screen of emails received by the house and proof of deposit in my name and I sent it.</p>
<p>After sending the house blocked me and no longer responds. Claimed I broke rules but I play alone from home on my computer and cell phone internet.</p>
<p>The 1xbet house is withholding my money, in fact STEALING, given that I have not broken any house rules and in your email it says that I could withdraw the balance that I had at the beginning of the check which was already approximately 5900 but blocked me claiming that I broke rules. Every house has the right to accept bets or not, the bets were accepted and paid and the house is now stealing from me.</p>
<p>The house itself sent me a message with the names of possible players asking my relationship with them and I don't even know who the people spoken are, this already shows bad faith.</p>
