<p>Concerns: casino Midas (Malta) eventual complaint</p>
<p>Dear,</p>
<p>The present intends to inform you of the unofficial (or even completely illegal) practices of an online casino. Various annexed documents tend to prove it. To tend to prove does not mean to prove anything, of course.</p>
<p>Before I list grievances, I want to make it clear that I am not seeking any remedy or wish to believe in moral values or even values inherent in justice. Nor do I want the present to be a kind of humanist protection that participates in a medical-moralistic catechism against excessive gambling. On the other hand, I wish that the means which you have at your disposal harm this casino (after all they are plunderers and they cheat with the tax). I wish my letter would harm them, that's all: not that it brings me reparation or serve the protective interests of other victim players. I will, however, accept to make a formal complaint, if you think that this company may be bored, it is only on this condition that I will accept to lodge a complaint.</p>
<p>Let us limit ourselves here to point out 5 elements of the order of the grievance (numbered from 1 to 5). These elements must certainly not be original (even if I have little practice of online gambling, these seem to me to be common sense, these harmful practices must be common, if not banal in the field of online gambling). Here you are. One can without doubt affirm the following, therefore (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Midas Casino usurps the limits of the Visa card by offering payments from another company (see Appendix). They make the transfers instead of the customer (with his agreement on the "cat", certainly, see appendix).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "system" (magic word and catch-all) is particularly opaque. The winnings are not paid on time (whether you are VIP or simple beginner pigeon, no delay of 48 hours or 72 hours is respected, the only times I won, the time was faster without being a VIP, a customer no VIP is paid faster, so). In addition you can not block the amount due, once the transfer requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bonus system is not clear (at all levels). Example you deposit 800 euros on a bonus of 75 and everything is suddenly divided by more than two, without any explanation, if not a reference to an obscure "financial department" that responds vaguely and never directly. Such darkness implies that the customer, disappointed, replaying his winnings, when in fact it is only what he has just added to a bonus. More clearly: you have a bonus of 75 euros (which implies conditions id is : replay a number of times the sum); you add about 800 euros on this bonus. You earn 2300.- on (75 + 800) = 875 euros. And the result, suddenly brutal, calculated by the system is the following: you have as balance - miracle of the scam -: 900 euros, approximately. You should have your 2300 euros having replayed at least 36 times the 75 bonus ... Suffice to say that you have almost won nothing and the bonus, yet replayed the number of times requested, is: a handicap (see document Annex). After you lose everything, out of spite ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The simple roulette (no "real time gaming") is probably faked. I have no proof. But in case of heavy losses, a collaborator suggests a number - (or three) sometimes - you can go up magically (I appreciate these scams!). Conversely, if you have too much money on your account, roulette will lose you. I made the experience by putting all the numbers to 1 euro, except one. Once out of 10 (not more than 15 times anyway) it is the unmapped number that came out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have sent a copy of the browser warning that the Midas site is illegal, as well as the black list you have prepared. I was told that everything was legal. I knew it was not the case (so I played knowing the illegality and I have nothing against it, to tell the truth). I assume. The difference is that I know their illegality and they: lie. I'm probably a disappointed player, but not a liar. I have nothing against illegality, but I prefer when it arises as such.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can multiply the grievances. [...]</p>
<p>Annexes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the main ones are mentioned in parentheses above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A letter from me sent to the casino electronically demanding my unsubscription and erasure of my data. I can not get the address of the head office, so I am forced to use the electronic way that has no legal value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Copy of this letter:</p>
<p>A copy of this is sent electronically (scan) to the casino at the same time as my final exclusion request.</p>
