<p>This integration is very important to Greentube as the supplier seeks to expand its footprint in South America</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC’s digital gaming and entertainment division, Greentube, has unveiled a new launch in Peru with a Betsson Group subsidiary. The operator in question is Inkabet, which has received a broad selection of Greentube titles.</p>
<p>Inkabet is a LATAM-oriented operator that will help Greentube strengthen its presence in the region. As agreed, the latter company will supply its new partner with some of the best titles in its portfolio, including classics such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Sizzling Hot Deluxe and Lucky Lady’s Charm Deluxe.</p>
<p>Slots aficionados that wish to try out fresher experiences, on the other hand, can fire the reels of innovative games such as Diamond Link: Mighty Buffalo and Diamond Link: Mighty Emperor, among others.</p>
<p>Greentube already enjoys huge popularity among players in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as well as in Chile and Ecuador. Meanwhile, Greentube also secured deals in Germany and Belgium where it launched with Jokerstar and Betway, respectively.</p>
<p>Greentube Is Happy to Supply a Betsson Subsidiary with Games</p>
<p>Greentube’s regional manager, Jelena Popovic, commented on the new launch, saying that her team is very happy to supply Inkabet with content. She praised the brand as one of the biggest names in Peruvian gaming and said that Greentube is looking forward to helping it channel more players toward its platform.</p>
<p>Popovic concluded that this integration is very important to her team as the supplier seeks to expand its footprint in South America.</p>
<p>This launch is one of great strategic importance as we continue to increase our hold in the continent and we look forward to seeing how Inkabet’s players react to our content. Jelena Popovic, regional manager, Greentube</p>
