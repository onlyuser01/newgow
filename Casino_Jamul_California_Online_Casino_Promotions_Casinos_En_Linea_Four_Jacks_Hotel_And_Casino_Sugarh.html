    <h1>Casino Jamul California Online Casino Promotions Casinos En Linea Four Jacks Hotel And Casino Sugarh</h1>

<p>The leader in socially responsible and environmentally sustainable development, Soloviev Group, announced it selected Mohegan as its casino partner for Freedom Plaza, a new large scale project that includes residential towers, casino, a Ferris Wheel and a museum located on the east side of Manhattan, New York</p>
<p>The bid for the project comes after recently, the gambling regulator in the state, the New York State Gaming Commission, opened an application request for the development of three downstate casinos. Those strategic projects are expected to deliver long-term value, boost tourism and deliver unique experiences for the visitors, something that both Soloviev Group and Mohegan have experience with.</p>
<p>The Freedom Plaza project is expected to have a significant positive impact on the community in the area by introducing green areas, an art performance venue, as well as a Ferris Wheel. Moreover, the Freedom Plaza would be the home of the first museum celebrating democracy and freedom, as well as a 1,000-room hotel, residential towers and a casino.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the large-scale project is expected to create thousands of new well-paid jobs during the construction phase. After that, upon completion, the project will also deliver permanent jobs as well. Overall, Freedom Plaza is expected to significantly boost the local economy and deliver a fresh stream of tax revenue.</p>
<p>A Strategic Partnership</p>
<p>Stefan Soloviev, Soloviev Group’s chairman, acknowledged that the company holds a leading position within socially responsible development. At the same time, he pointed out that Soloviev Group supports Mohegan’s goals for carbon-neutral and sustainable property development.</p>
<p>Finally, Soloviev said: “This strategic partnership will not only ensure that Freedom Plaza will be ethically developed, but provide long-term economic prosperity for the local community, a positive impression on regional and international tourism, and a lasting impact on New York City for generations to come.”</p>
<p>“As a leader in socially responsible development, we will honor, complement and advance Mohegan’s principles through sustainable and carbon-neutral property development.“ Stefan Soloviev, chairman of Soloviev Group</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, Mohegan’s CEO and president, explained that the company is famous for delivering unique experiences and exceptional services for its guests. He outlined that Mohegan has a strong set of values, culture and commitment that distinguish it from other companies. Pineault spoke about the company’s rich heritage and experience which enables it to be a leading employer and deliver supreme services for its guests.</p>
<p>“We look forward to infusing our “Spirit of Aquai,” our guiding philosophy, into New York State.“ Ray Pineault, CEO and president of Mohegan</p>
<p>The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut established Mohegan as an extension back in 1995. Overall, the company has more than 25 years of experience within the gaming and hospitality sector and is an emerging leader within the vertical.</p>
