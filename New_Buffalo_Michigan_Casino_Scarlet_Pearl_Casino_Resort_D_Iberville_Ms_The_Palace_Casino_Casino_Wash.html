    <h1>New Buffalo Michigan Casino Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort D Iberville Ms The Palace Casino Casino Wash</h1>

<p>I previously been paid on Winport after losing a while and getting a free bonus. They paid out the $150. So I kept playing there a bit.</p>
<p>The format for their history is ID: Date : Amount: Type of transaction : Payment Method : Status : Remaining Balance</p>
<p>On their system time I deposited:</p>
<p>$303.486</p>
<p>10/20/2022 03:04:39 am</p>
<p>Based even on their own records. The bonus was 300% for the deposit and 100% cashback if I lost:</p>
<p>209051300% VIP Bonus + 100% CashbackCampaign Wager Bonus 910.170 10/20/2022 03:04:52 am11335.56 Closed 10/20/2022 04:21:38 am11335.656</p>
<p>The max I could withdraw is 10622~</p>
<p>I requested the first withdrawal at max being $2000 BTC. I understand their ToS mentions they can reduce the amount for whatever reason and it takes up to 7 days. However, they only paid $400 the first time:</p>
<p>2365110/26/2022 05:35:31 am 400 WithdrawDF-BitCoinsApproved 13,086.656</p>
<p>Then the next withdrawal which came today for $250 even less than before:</p>
<p>24464 11/01/2022 08:30:02 am 250 WithdrawDF-BitCoins Approved 9,919.656</p>
<p>So from the $10,622~ they have only paid $650 since Oct 20th when i first won/withdrew.</p>
<p>The decreasing amount of withdrawal and the weekly limit only makes me worried as they give no reason as to why they would let me get less than before other than for the obvious reason being that they cannot actually payout what players win.</p>
<p>Please assist me getting what I won üôÅ</p>
