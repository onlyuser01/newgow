    <h1>Casino In Petoskey Mi Online Gambling Casino Real Money Real Money Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus C</h1>

<p>I registered at the casino at the beginning of July 2022. I used my first deposit bonus. The conditions of the bonus included that the maximum payout could be 15X the bonus paid.</p>
<p>I reached this maximum, then I continued to play with this money, and my balance went up to over 2000 euros.</p>
<p>I initiated a withdraw, and then they asked for the necessary documents to prove my identity. In the meantime, they blocked my account, at first they didn't tell me for what reason. It later turned out that the day before (allegedly) someone tried to commit fraud, and since I also tried to pay with several cards (because the system did not accept it), their security system detected suspicious activity and investigated it.</p>
<p>After three days they said that my account was reopened and I could play, make withdrawals, etc. I made my withdraw on 07.05 and it took 10 days for us to start the payment... But how... They said that since I won the amount from bonus money, they can transfer 500 euros per week. This was not true just because the bonus money is maximized based on the terms of the contract, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>After reopening my account, they limited my bets to a maximum of around 2-3 euros. It doesn't matter if I played in a live casino or on a slot machine. I couldn't even buy a bonus. They were afraid that I might win a bigger amount...</p>
<p>So that money was already raw money, from which I went over 2,000 euros. I got the first payout and the rest I gambled back because the rest for my own health.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this casino is very cumbersome, it is extremely difficult to contact a competent person. He has indicated during our correspondence that he does not check his inbox 0/24 and he is very busy.</p>
<p>For anyone who thinks logically, it becomes completely clear that this casino is trying to get the player to play back their money.</p>
<p>Those of us who gamble know that this can easily happen.</p>
<p>It's okay, it was tuition money for me to stop playing at this point even though I really like to play.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the result of the poorly regulated casino market in recent years is that almost anyone can open a casino and do whatever they want with the player.</p>
<p>We players are left defenseless in a malfunctioning system.</p>
<p>In the old system (around 2015), there were only a small number of such and similar casinos on the market. Then all of a sudden there were a lot of them.</p>
<p>I don't recommend this casino to anyone unless you want to have a rough day. Stay away! Look for a normal casino where, if you win, you don't have to wait 10 days for the first installment of your winnings, and where they don't make you look stupid.</p>
<p>I regret that we have reached this point in 2022, that they can actually do anything to us in the casinos under the Curacao license.</p>
<p>Always read the general and bonus terms and conditions thoroughly. Good luck! I finished the game... I hope many more will follow my example, because there is no remedy against fake money streamers and unreliable casinos. (I'm not talking about the Mad Money casino here, but in general.)</p>
