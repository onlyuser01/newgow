<p>Cats review</p>
<p>The Cats slot game released by IGT perfectly reflects both the company’s old and renowned land-based casino products business, and their dedication to the newly established online market. The game not only introduced some innovative and refreshing approach to the typical slots gameplay, but also to the theme of cats.</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>To clarify, the Cats slot by IGT actually deals with wild cats instead of domestic pets, and will likely transcend players to the sun-washed African savannahs through the reel backdrop.</p>
<p>While there is no in-depth storyline to boost the immersive experience, the overall combination of elements manages to set the right tone for any cats lover.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Considering it is an extension to IGT’s land-based slot product, and one released some time ago, the graphics and animation effects are bound to seem a bit outdated in the ever-developing tech software industry.</p>
<p>The sound effects offer a surprising twist, as most regular slot players would expect the typical drum-like beat of the African wilderness, whilst they are welcomed by the roar of wildcats.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The basic gameplay elements directly reflect the theme of the slot, with the 5x3 reel grid set against a sunset-like backdrop, and the symbols bearing the animated likeness of all kinds of felines. Namely, the lowest value symbols on the grid make use of the standard J, Q, K and A cards, while those offering higher payouts include lions, tigers, black panthers, mountain lions and cheetahs.</p>
<p>Aside from the regular symbols on the Cats slot reels, there are those triggering the gameplay’s special features – the cat paw Scatter and the Cats logo as Wild. The latter is particularly crucial to the slot’s overall action, as it offers players the chance to hit the fixed jackpot of 10,000 coins when 5 Cats Wilds appear on the reels.</p>
<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>As it was just mentioned, there are significant amounts to be won at this slot’s reel grid when taking into account the bonus features. Split symbolsis one such bonus feature – when the animals or paws on the slot’s symbols come in pairs, the single symbol tile stands for two of the same kind. Split symbols can land on all 5 reels, offering their payout for 10 on an active payline.</p>
<p>The Free Spins bonus round is yet another feature – it is triggered by the cat’s paw Scatter symbol which can land on the middle reels 2, 3 and 4. A minimum of 5 is required to trigger a round of 5 Free Spins, while 6 Paws, i.e. 3 split symbols will reward players with 10 Free Spins. Even if only 4 Paws appear per spin, players can benefit fromis multiplier – 2x the total bet.</p>
<p>Bet size and payouts</p>
<p>Players can choose to bet from as little as €0.01 for 1 line 1 coin bet up to €30 as a max bet amount, with the ability to benefit from maximum 30 adjustable paylines. As for wins, the cards have the lowest payouts while the wildcats give players the chance to win 1000x their bet amount, with the exception of the black panther which pays 2500x the bet amount for 10 (5 split symbols) on an active payline.</p>
<p>RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The slot’s RTP has been calculated at 94.93%, with a low to mid variance estimate. This allows players to argue this slot title as below industry average, considering the range of gameplay and RTP percentages available on more recent releases.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>All in all, the Cats slot release by IGT manages to meet players’ basic needs and beyond, while its attractive bonus features and jackpot opportunity make it an appealing online gambling destination. It may need some fine-tuning of the design or sound aspects, but its rewarding potential is definitely its redeeming quality.</p>
