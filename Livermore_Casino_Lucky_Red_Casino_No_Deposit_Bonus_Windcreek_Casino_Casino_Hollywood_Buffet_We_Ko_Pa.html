<p>Gambling software development specialist Softswiss has agreed to onboard Gaming Corps’ premium suite of iGaming titles on its platform. This will help the former company’s content access many new operators and clients.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps to Power Softswiss with Content</p>
<p>Per the agreement, Gaming Corps will power Softswiss’ platform with its full portfolio. As a result, Gaming Corps’ content will become available to the 600+ iGaming companies within the Softswiss network. Companies will, therefore, be able to access great gaming titles such as Coin Miner, Skyliner and Stormy Witch, three of Gaming Corps’ hits.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Gaming Corps picked Softswiss is that the latter company is the first iGaming software giant to work with cryptocurrencies. As the crypto and gaming sectors become more and more intertwined, appealing to the crypto community becomes more and more crucial. As a visionary, Gaming Corps is well-aware of these tendencies and therefore picked an aggregator that corresponds to its vision.</p>
<p>The deal will also benefit Softswiss, which will be able to enrich its portfolio with a huge selection of fan-favorite games. It will also be able to boost its market representation by adding more games by a Swedish developer to its lineup.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Is Excited to See How Its Games Will Perform</p>
<p>Tatyana Kaminskaya, the head of Softswiss’ Game Aggregator, was excited to announce Gaming Corps as the new addition to the company’s proprietary aggregation platform. She noted that her team is delighted by the opportunity to offer Gaming Corps’ high-profile games and appeal to more customers and demographics.</p>
<p>Kaminskaya concluded that the new agreement will surely help Softswiss broaden its horizons. She concluded that the addition of more varied content will very likely provide a strong player boost.</p>
<p>Mats Lundin, Gaming Corps’ chief commercial officer, lauded Softswiss as an iGaming juggernaut with a visionary approach. He praised the company for being the first iGaming software firm to adopt cryptocurrencies and added that he is happy about the partnership. Lundin is sure that the marrying of Gaming Corps’ next-gen casino content and Softswiss’ unparalleled market presence will result in great benefits for both parties. Lundin concluded that he will excitedly follow how Gaming Corps’ games progress on the Softswiss Game Aggregator.</p>
<p>In other news, Gaming Corps just launched its offerings in Gibraltar, thanks to its agreement with Relax Gaming. Thanks to this, customers in the country can now enjoy the Swedish developer’s great lineup of slots, table games, crash games and mine games.</p>
<p>In August, the developer also penned an agreement with Hub88, another notable aggregator.</p>
