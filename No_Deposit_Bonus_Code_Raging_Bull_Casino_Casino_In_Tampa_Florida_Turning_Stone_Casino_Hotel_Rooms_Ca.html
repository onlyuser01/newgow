<p>Caesars Entertainment, an American casino company, signed a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Omaha Productions, a sports entertainment company founded by Peyton Manning, a retired NFL quarterback.</p>
<p>Caesars and Omaha to Launch Omaha Audio Network</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Caesars and Omaha will work together to launch Omaha Audio Network, a full-service audio production network. Furthermore, the two partners will host new digital and live events to engage sports fans.</p>
<p>Omaha Audio Network will see Caesars and Omaha produce podcasts and invite famous sports celebrities to share their insights on sports. Fans will be able to watch the promotional content on multiple platforms. In addition, Manning and his company will produce and broadcast various digital series on Caesars’ and Omaha’s social media channels.</p>
<p>Sports enthusiasts can expect to see Caesars Sportsbook’s brand ambassadors appear on the new podcast series. This will notably include Kenny Mayne, a famous sports media personality and Rachel DeMita, a retired basketball professional. Copper Manning, brother of Peyton Manning will also make an appearance.</p>
<p>That’s not all as the most loyal Caesars users will be able to take part in the action themselves. Through the Caesars Rewards loyalty program, sports enthusiasts will be able to take their engagement further and participate in live events. This will allow the most passionate fans of sport to meet the Manning brothers and the Omaha Audio Network talents in person.</p>
<p>Caesars and Omaha Are a Perfect Match</p>
<p>Sharon Otterman, CMO of Caesars Digital, said that this is not a mere sponsorship deal but rather a strategic partnership. She said that Caesars is looking forward to working together with Manning and Omaha to come up with new content. Otterman emphasized that the new content will be the result of the professional expertise of “two leaders in the sports and entertainment space.”</p>
