<p>A leading aggregator and game content provider added another high-profile operator partner to further boost its platform’s content offering while helping its new partner expand its presence in the Latin American region.</p>
<p>‘Successful and Innovative Partnership’</p>
<p>Pariplay, Aspire Global’s aggregation iGaming platform, signed a content distribution deal with Ainsworth Game Technology (AGT) to distribute its online gaming content in Latin American countries via Pariplay’s Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Andrew Maclean, VP, Sales, Pariplay, asserted, “We are pleased and very excited about the beginning of this alliance. The new opportunities and reach that we will have in a greater number of regulated markets by the hand of a great company like Ainsworth, with experience and knowledge, is encouraging. This event undoubtedly marks the beginning of a very successful and innovative partnership.”</p>
<p>The new commercial partnership that will ensure all of AGT’s new online releases reach players in the region via the innovative Fusion platform is part of both partners’ strategic plans to expand their presence in Latin America.</p>
<p>Ainsworth is continuing our online growth strategy and this partnership with Pariplay will significantly strengthen our offering and further consolidate our position as a top-tier slot developer in Latin American markets.” Jason Lim, General Manager, Online, AGT</p>
<p>Latin America Vital for Companies’ Growth</p>
<p>In August, AGT released its audited earnings report for the fiscal year 2021, which showed the company incurred a financial loss despite a 7% growth in revenue. The gains in North America and Australia were offset by a huge decrease in revenues from Latin American operations, prompting the company to undertake actions to mitigate the effect.</p>
<p>For Pariplay, which launched into Colombia via an agreement with Codere Group in May, the new partnership is the latest sign of the aggregator’s commitment to provide its operator partners utilizing the Fusion platform with the best possible industry content.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform allows its customers to enhance player value by utilizing a suite of back-office conversion and retention tools, while offering players a variety of online game content provided by industry-leading game developers. The platform also features a broad range of innovative and entertaining in-house developed slot games.</p>
<p>Offering operators a simple and easy integration with no additional effort on their side, the Fusion platform connects to almost any system via a clean API and provides a complete and dependable solution, while the platform’s widgets and tools facilitate an efficient launch and operation of any online gaming business.</p>
