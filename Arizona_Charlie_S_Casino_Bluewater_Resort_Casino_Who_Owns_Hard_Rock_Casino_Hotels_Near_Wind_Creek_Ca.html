<p>Cluster Tumble review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around an adventuring couple who are somewhat based on Tomb Raider and Uncharted lead characters.</p>
<p>Players will join a daring heroine as she searches for her lover in the ruins of a faraway land. Snagging jewels and precious artifacts as they go, players will venture into an ancient temple.</p>
<p>This game is great for players who enjoy ancient-Egyptian, Chinese, or Aztec-themed slots. The exotic locations are a fun escape and the quest at hand will make players feel like Lara Croft.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a tune saturated with mystery and low drums. This adds to the tension and the foreign vibe of the world.</p>
<p>The animation quality is decent, though it feels more like the aesthetic of a videogame than an animated film.</p>
<p>The symbols include a range of vibrant jewels in tempting hues, suggesting rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. Players will also find ancient artifacts crafted from gold and gems, portraying animals and cryptic faces. The aesthetics of these artifacts definitely mixes and matches different cultures. For example, some items look like they could be found in ancient Egypt and others in China.</p>
<p>The reels seem to be crafted from stone and on each side of them a pillar of sculptures stands proudly. Cast in gold, these sculptures include the frightening faces of god-like creatures. Players will have no doubt they have arrived at a sacred monument of some kind.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, our heroine stands confidently, one hand on her hip and another holding up a torch. Her tattooed arms are toned and she leaves no doubt that she’s capable of leading the mission.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of this game create the atmosphere of an amorphously exotic location.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cluster Tumble is played on an eight by eight grid. Wins are awarded for landing clusters of at least four matching symbols. Symbols that form winning combinations must be connected either horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>However, the number of symbols in play is randomised, with the outer squares of the grid being place-held by stone blockers.</p>
<p>The cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations (and the stone blockers they are in direct contact with) will vanish, making way for new symbols to fall into their positions.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature is triggered. Players can also trigger the Free Spins feature by removing all the blockers from the reels.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins with 5 free spins. If players clear all the reels while in the Free Spins feature, they will land an additional 3 free spins and increase the win multiplier by x3.</p>
<p>If they clear the reels again, they receive a multiplier of x6. If they clear the reels a third time, they receive a multiplier of x9. These multipliers remain in effect throughout the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Landing a Scatter symbol during the Free Spins feature will award players an additional free spin.</p>
<p>Some of the stone blockers have special properties which can be activated when they are adjacent to a winning cluster. These special blocks are Wild symbols, Lightning Win symbols, and Fire Transform symbols.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The Lightning Win block symbol is replaced by its target symbol (this is also one of the regular symbols) when activated. This symbol prompts all matching target symbols as well as Wilds to create wins regardless of where they are on the reels.</p>
<p>The Fire Transform symbol is replaced by its own target symbol when activated. During the cascade that follows, one or two types of symbol are transformed to match this target symbol.</p>
<p>Players can opt to buy directly into the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.4%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this slot for its high RTP and high volatility.</p>
<p>With a creative adventure theme and strategy-friendly volatility, this game is both a fun and savvy choice.</p>
<p>The bonus features keep the gameplay entertaining and ensure that players will stay engaged while the adventurous theme will allow players to imagine they are off chasing ancient treasures all around the world.</p>
