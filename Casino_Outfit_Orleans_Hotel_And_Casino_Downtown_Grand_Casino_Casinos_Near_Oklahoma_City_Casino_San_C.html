    <h1>Casino Outfit Orleans Hotel And Casino Downtown Grand Casino Casinos Near Oklahoma City Casino San C</h1>

<p>Incentive Games is growing its footprint through a groundbreaking partnership with legacy sports betting and gaming brand bet365. The company will muster a number of pay-to-play and free-to-play titles that will be offered as exclusive content to bet365.</p>
<p>Specifically, Incentive Games will focus on developing jackpot games and delivering them on a global scale through the bet365 brand. The deployment, the companies hope, will lead to reactivation, better retention, and customer acquisition in the long term.</p>
<p>Jackpot Games to Become a Global Hit with bet365</p>
<p>Incentive Games, which prides itself on its delivery of F2P and P2P games, will be adding bespoke content exclusively available to bet365 users. The games are not designed on a whim but involve an in-depth understanding of particular consumer bases, design and gamification consultation, extensive testing throughout the game development process, and a robust foundation based on math to power the experiences.</p>
<p>Incentive Games CEO John Gordon has welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with bet365 as a recognizable name in iGaming:</p>
<p>“bet365 is an industry power player, and we are delighted to be working with the operator to develop and deliver a suite of bespoke Free-to-Play and Pay-to-Play titles.” Incentive Games CEO John Gordon</p>
<p>Gordon did not miss the opportunity to point out the advantages of the Incentive Games portfolio. In the company’s own testament, partners who leverage its gaming portfolio can expect a 50% increase in week-to-week retention and a 22% reduction of customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>Bet365 Confident in the Choice of New Partner</p>
<p>Bet365 was equally pleased with the company’s track record for building successful products that appeal to iGaming enthusiasts, enhance existing business operations, or lead to new ones:</p>
<p>“We were impressed with Incentive’s track record of developing Free-to-Play content that delivers significant results when it comes to acquisition, reactivation, and retention.” Bet365 spokesperson</p>
<p>Bet365 is confident that the new titles would help it improve its overall acquisition rate and tap into new demographics. The jackpot features are powerful incentives to players to come and try the products, and bet365 are confident that the products would equally appeal to the existing demographics just as well.</p>
