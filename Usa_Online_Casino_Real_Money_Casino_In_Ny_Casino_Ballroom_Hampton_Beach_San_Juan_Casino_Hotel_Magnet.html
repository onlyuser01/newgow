<p>Gift &amp; Go leverages the power of Amazon Business to provide companies with engaging gifting programs that improve customer loyalty</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT) has unveiled an agreement with the business-to-business gifting technology platform Gift &amp; Go. Thanks to this agreement, casino partners of IGT’s ADVANTAGE management system will be able to add gifting solutions to their offerings.</p>
<p>Gift &amp; Go allows companies to provide their customers with special gift programs tailored to their needs and receive a variety of goods. It is a fairly new gifting tech platform that leverages the power of Amazon Business to help its partners win customers. What makes it so special is provides customers with the freedom of choosing a reward they truly desire.</p>
<p>IGT’s casino partners will therefore be able to integrate the gifting tech platform into their slots, secondary displays and service windows using IGT’s M5 content management tech. With IGT being one of the biggest gambling companies in the world, many operators will be able to benefit from Gift &amp; Go’s solutions.</p>
<p>IGT has a well-established global presence and is active in over 100 markets around the world. Its team of 10,500 employees helps it create a lot of value for many partners.</p>
<p>IGT Is Happy to Provide Its Clients with a New Solution</p>
<p>Gift &amp; GO’s co-chief executive officer, Jon Reuben, commented on the agreement. He said that the integration with the IGT ADVANTAGE casino management system will allow his team to provide a spectrum of casino operators with solutions to increase customer loyalty. Gifting programs, Reuben noted, can also increase revenue while reducing player walk rate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ryan Reddy, senior vice president of global video poker, VLT, systems and payments at IGT, said that the new agreement will provide IGT ADVANTAGE with “incremental value.” He is sure that players will delight in being able to get items from Amazon Business through casino loyalty club gifting programs.</p>
<p>Reddy noted that his team views the integration as a great way to enhance IGT’s system solutions offering while arming its partners with a new solution to engage players.</p>
<p>We view this as a great way to enhance our systems solutions offering while helping our customers reduce product storage demands, labor requirements and capital allocations through a convenient and modern experience for their guests.
