<p>Hi, I can tell you that 1 win is one of the most scammers in the world right now, I'll explain in the short term what happened, playing I got to 100k, I was loading a lot of money, and I was lucky enough to arrive at 100k, the problem is that from there I was no longer able to download the money, a nervousness with the operators who kept telling me try again, try again, try again, but nothing, now I have reached the most total disappointment and despair, so I decide to play them again , and I get to 500k, a figure never reached until now, the real problem is that already by not making withdraw I said, fuck me now how the hell do I do? , and no gentlemen, after 2 days waiting for contact and more, they close my account, you can not imagine how many emails, and how many times I had to write to the site, I was crying, thinking all that money won, and not to be able to withdraw them, but especially when they closed my account, from there the world fell on me, I tried in all the ways in the world, but nothing gets me an email with written, we checked your account, and there is it was a violation or something illegal, I really wanted to eat them, I sent my documents, with face also, all the credit cards that I top up my account, and they tell me that I play illegally, I knew I shouldn't top up a lot of money there and then arriving at a very large balance, I played, and I still play it at Italian sites, and then arrived at the conclusion I sent another email with a huge disappointment, to think that I was feeling really bad, all that money won legally, disappeared in 2 days, truly gone mad, and the first time this happens in 10 years of play, the other sites never had any problems, I ask you to be careful and never happen I hope so in my situation, left without a I have a shred of hope, I only have one last email to send and see if I can recover it</p>
