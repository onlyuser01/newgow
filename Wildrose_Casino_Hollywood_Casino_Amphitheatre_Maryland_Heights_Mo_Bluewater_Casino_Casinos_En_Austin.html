    <h1>Wildrose Casino Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Maryland Heights Mo Bluewater Casino Casinos En Austin</h1>

<p>At the end of June, leading free-to-play sports gaming technology company Low6 announced the launch of a fresh Business to Business white-label gamification solution. Today, the company announced it has completed its rebranding procedure. Low6’s fresh brand elements include a different logo, a new company identity, and a fresh tagline.</p>
<p>“Make Your Play” – Low6’s New Slogan</p>
<p>The company has selected the “Make Your Play” tagline as a means of expressing its new gamification direction proven through the recent launch of its white-label platform. The new brand elements have been handpicked to showcase the company’s “current position and offering to the market”, while also expressing Low6’s growth in the past year. The new white-label proposition will be used to supply media companies and sports betting operators with superior acquisition and data collection opportunities. Low6’s chief executive officer Jamie Mitchell further explained how their innovative technology “caught the attention of sports teams, leagues and industry operators” in the last two years.</p>
<h1>1 Acquisition Play for the Industry</h1>
<p>Mitchell also mentioned the company’s new partnerships and prestigious industry awards added to its portfolio, mentioning how Low6 wanted to reflect all these changes and expanded gamification opportunities through new brand elements. The company’s next-generation gamification innovations brought it remarkable awards. The list includes the ”Rising Star” and the “Virtual and Fantasy Operator” titles during the 2021 EGR Operator Awards, along with the Industry Rising Star title during the SiGMA Americas Award in 2022, the “Freeplay Gaming Supplier” award at the EGR North America Awards 2022, or the “Fantasy &amp; DFS Supplier” title during the EGR B2B Awards 2022. Mitchell was nominated for the “Entrepreneur Of The Year 2022” award.</p>
<p>Low6’s fresh logo was therefore designed in such a way as to express the way the company’s technology will offer the number one acquisition play for the entire gaming and sports betting industry.</p>
<p>The company initially took off as a provider of free-to-play formats to a series of powerful sports teams and leagues around the world, including the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the Detroit Pistons, Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Cincinnati Bengals. The news of the rebranding comes less than a month after Low6’s co-founder Wayne Stevenson decided to give up his position within the company five years after joining it.</p>
<p>Low6’s UltimateFan fantasy game recorded 150,000 installs across the company’s partner games while being ranked in the first position as the Top Grossing App in the App Store. The game also won the prestigious “Innovation of the Year” and “Best Fantasy Product” titles at the EGR Awards.</p>
