    <h1>High 5 Casino Free Coins Palace Station Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino Play Casino Bonus Closest</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>at 5 Gringo Casino my VIP status is: Hanz Jackpot</p>
<p>And with this VIP status, I can also withdraw €800 a day (in 24 hours).</p>
<p>Terms and Conditions 6.11</p>
<p>I won a total of €2400 at the casino.</p>
<p>This amount does not include any bonus or bonus money and is pure profit, from my deposit, from my bank account.</p>
<p>I made 3 withdrawal requests</p>
<p>on 10/12/2022 , 800 € on 10/13/2022, 800 € on 10/14/2022, 800 €</p>
<p>See photo !</p>
<p>The transfer to my bank account should be made with Bank Transfer.</p>
<p>The AGNs state that the payment requests will be processed within 3 working days.</p>
<p>Withdrawal times are said to be Monday through Friday from 6am to 5pm GTM time.</p>
<p>Terms and Conditions 6.15</p>
<p>I also received emails from the casino confirming my 3 withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>Today is October 17th, 2022 and the first application from October 12th, 2022 (800 €) is still not being processed and has not been transferred for payment.</p>
<p>3 working days have passed and all 3 payment requests are still open.</p>
<p>At least the first payment application, from October 12th, 2022, could have been completely completed.</p>
<p>Then the message came up in the casino that I should verify myself</p>
<p>my identity card / passport with a selfie</p>
<p>I did both immediately, but the verification is still open. My uploaded document and the photo has not yet been edited.</p>
<p>See photo !</p>
<p>My questions can't be answered in the live chat, they just keep telling me to be patient.</p>
<p>I am not given any further information.</p>
<p>The only reason given to me is that the live chat has so many customer inquiries.</p>
<p>But what do the player requests in the live chat have to do with the processing of my withdrawal requests and the 5Gringo finance department?</p>
<p>T&amp;C 6.16 states that the payout may be delayed if the player has to verify himself first.</p>
<p>I verified immediately within minutes...as requested by the casino...but the verification check is not in progress.</p>
<p>I can't understand why it's taking longer now, because it wasn't my first payout at the casino.</p>
<p>On July 1st, 2022, the casino transferred €500 to my bank account with a bank transfer and it was in my account after a few days.</p>
<p>See uploaded photo!</p>
<p>On July 1st, 2022 there were no problems, but now there are and everything is delayed.</p>
<p>greeting</p>
<p>Mrs.R</p>
