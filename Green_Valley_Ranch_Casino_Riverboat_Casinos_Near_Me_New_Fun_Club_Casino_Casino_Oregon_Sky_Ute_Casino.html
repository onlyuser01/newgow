<p>Inspired is breaking ground in the Caribbean virtual sports market though a localized partnership with CAGE Companies.</p>
<p>CAGE Retail Outlets to Host Inspired’s Virtual Sports Product</p>
<p>CAGE’s retail outlets across the Caribbean are about to welcome Inspired Entertainment’s turnkey V-Play Plug &amp; Play solution, courtesy of a new partnership forged between the companies.</p>
<p>Inspired will benefit from CAGE’s vast network of lottery and video gaming terminals in the Caribbean and possibly South America. CAGE will strengthen its portfolio of products, bringing new options to sport-hungry fans. The addition of virtual sports will give a fresh push to both companies in the region starting this year, with Inspired’s already posting solid results in 2020.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership, CAGE customers will be able to tap into numerous virtual sports options. Those include virtual cricket which is a first for Inspired. Inspired had time to think through its next move in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the CAGE Companies seemed the perfect fit, argued Inspired President and COO Brooks Pierce.</p>
<p>“Our virtuals have proven popular in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America and we see the Caribbean as an opportunity to showcase the strength of our overall offerings.” Inspired President and COO Brooks Pierce</p>
<p>Apart from hosting Inspired’s virtual sports portfolio, CAGE will be in full control of the product and able to sublicense as per the agreement. Commenting on the newly-formed alliance, CAGE Companies majority owner Robert L. Johnson said he was happy to see Inspired’s product hit the markets in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Virtual Cricket Poised to Make Waves in the Caribbean</p>
<p>CAGE will focus on delivering its solutions on time for the cricket season with Inspired’s virtual cricket debuting for the first time anywhere. According to Johnson, the retail network in the region will be able to benefit from improved finances thanks to the extended cricket season in combination with the new virtual sport addition.</p>
<p>CAGE Companies Chairman and CEO Robert B. Washington also pitched in the conversation. He said that the company was looking forward to launching and scaling its virtual sports business in the region.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the new Caribbean Legends of Cricket virtual sports initiative would prove popular with local crowds. Especially those who are looking for new cricket options. Inspired has had a string of successful tie-ups in recent months. The company teamed up with iGaming and betting leader Entain. Inspired also signed up with Greece’s OPAP retail network, bringing virtual basketball to local audiences.</p>
<p>The company further sealed a partnership with DraftKings. At the beginning of 2020, Inspired added Bet365 and 888 as partners in New Jersey. With its latest move in the Caribbean, Inspired is consolidating its position as a global leader in virtual sports. Exploring new markets is part of its global growth strategy.</p>
