    <h1>Treasure Island Resort And Casino Casino Hotels Near Me Casino Promotions The Commerce Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I paid a total of 441 euros at this casino. With the last deposit I was able to at least somewhat reduce my losses. When I paid out I was asked for documents and the next day I was told that I already had a closed account.</p>
<p>Of course, I was not aware of this when I registered, and I know that no winnings will be paid out in such cases.</p>
<p>But now comes the hammer, I would like to be reimbursed 31 euros even though I deposited 441 and still have 410 remaining credits (no bonuses used). For my understanding, the part of my deposits that is still available must be refunded, that is theft what you try to do with me there.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the whole thing was already 11 days ago, the option to pay out is blocked and of course I was not asked for an account number or something, how would you like to reimburse something at all?</p>
