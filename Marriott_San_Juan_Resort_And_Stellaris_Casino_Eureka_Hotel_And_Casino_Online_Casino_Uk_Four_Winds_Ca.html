    <h1>Marriott San Juan Resort And Stellaris Casino Eureka Hotel And Casino Online Casino Uk Four Winds Ca</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Sonia H*** I’m not sure if you can help me but I’m not sure where to go for help.</p>
<p>I am a player of playamo36 I have an account and it is verified for payouts. On 23rd may I deposited $50 from my bank credit card which is verified in my account and linked to my bank account for bank transfers etc. I have had one payout from this site before of $500.</p>
<p>On the 23rd may after depositing my money I won enough money to do a cash withdrawal of $250. On my request of the cash withdrawal it kept coming back denied so I contacted the support chat team and spoke to 4 different people over the duration of the whole afternoon. They told me I needed to send them a photo of a card I used to make a deposit with on the 12 may. Firstly I don’t understand why because the deposit I made on the 12 may made no winnings at all and had made other deposits after this using my bank verified credit card. The winnings I made were from the deposit made on the 23 may with my bank credit card that is verified. The card I used for the deposit on 12 may was from my zip money account. With zip money you do not have a physical card to your account if you need to use a credit card for any purchases etc online you ask to generate a credit card to your account. On this day I generated a card and used the card details that was given in the app to my account and then typed in the details of that card to playamo36 to make the deposit. I was unaware that each time you go into your zip money account and ask to generate a card it gives a different card number each time. I sent screenshots of a generated credit card from zip money explaining all this but it was not approved because it was not the same card number. I also sent a screen shot of my history showing the transaction from zip money with the card number they required a photo of for proof also explaining the problem. I asked to speak to a supervisor or the finance department to help solve this and was told it was impossible to speak to either that if I had a complaint I had to email there security team. I am very annoyed. How can I give them proof of a card I used back on 12 may when that card number that was generated on that day is gone. I can’t give them what I don’t have and can’t get. I made no winnings from that deposit anyway. The wi bings I made 23 may where from a deposit I made using my verified bank card link to my account. Can you please help me with who to contact in regards to this matter. I have asked the support chat team who is the only people you can talk to what other information I could give them and they say they don’t know it’s up to the finance department yet they won’t give me any details to contact the finance department. Looking forward to hearing from you with any advice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
