    <h1>Dreamers Casino Online Casino Slot Games Nekoosa Casino Best Casino Online Real Money Bitcoin Cash C</h1>

<p>Hi, please understand that this is my first complaint on any platform ever &amp; I’ve made every attempt to research and resolve the issue with their support team. It’s sad because I like this site and thought I was a valued player, I’ve played for a couple of months now and definitely paid in more than I’ve withdrawn and it’s been fun. UNTIL I WAS REMOVED FROM ALL PERK AND REWARDS AND RECLASSIFIED ???</p>
<p>It’s soo confusing and makes zero sense, but outta nowhere my account was completely different and I thought it was a glitch because **I no longer received daily free spins,</p>
<p>**I couldn’t complete in any tournaments,</p>
<p>**I no longer received reward percentages from my deposits,</p>
<p>*I had no coupons being offered anymore,</p>
<p>*I didn’t even receive the regular emails I would get daily???</p>
<p>ALL OF THESE I WAS WOULD GET AUTOMATICALLY AND ENJOYED FOR MANY WEEKS WITH NO ISSUES</p>
<p>So I ask live support what’s going on and they tell me im no longer eligible for any of these services anymore because my account has been reclassified and it was done automatically by their systems algorithm!</p>
<p>They said maybe it will update and change on its own but they can not do anything about it? Im told to just keep playing and they apologize. I asked if I did anything wrong or did they need me to do anything differently? They continue to tell me that it’s nothing I’ve done wrong and it’s just the algorithm, but it really feels like im being punished and treated extremely unfair. This has been going on for a couple of weeks I believe now and I’ve contacted them through chat almost daily because nothing has changed no matter what I’ve deposited wich is hundreds just since this happened. The only emails I get now are my deposit emails but everyone of them advertise the daily free spins I can have with 20 dollar deposits. But I never get them and when I ask they remind me im not eligible in my class??</p>
<p>I tell them that according to their sites information that I see evertime I play I definitely qualify with the money I pay in and could somebody please fix my account?</p>
<p>At most they will offer a free chip and treat me like their doing me a favor as if I’m trying to milk the system. when it still doesn’t add up to what I should be automatically receiving from how much I deposite like before when I felt like a regular customer. They say they reserve the right to make changes at anytime they deemed necessary, I asked what deemed my account necessary to be changed when I’ve done nothing wrong and they say it’s all automatic and just part of the system??</p>
<p>I politely asked them why would taking things away for no reason be smart business and why can’t I find any information saying that this is normal procedure that anyone can have happen at any time? Then they just close chat me. I don’t understand and I’m leaving this message because it’s wrong to punish a costumer they say they value and take the things they clearly advertise on their site that everyone else can have but not me no matter how much I deposit? I ONLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND, AND I ONLY WANTED MY ACCOUNT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. I DIDNT WANT ANYTHING FOR FREE, I ONLY WANTED WHAT I EARNED AND PAID FOR AS ADVERTISED. PLEASE HELP-THANK YOU FOR LISTENING (did this happen to anyone else)</p>
