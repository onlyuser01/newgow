<p>Spinomenal has expanded its presence in Spain through a dedicated content deal with CasinoBarcelona.es. This will allow the supplier to deploy a number of its flagship games, to wit Demi Gods II, Wolf Fang, Queen of Fire, and Majestic King, among others, with the popular local iGaming brand, and deploy a range of fresh experiences for its players.</p>
<p>The content is deployed through integration with OpenGaming, Light &amp; Wonder’s popular platform that facilitates such partnerships and makes it easy for operators to access new content from their partners.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz has hailed the importance to be growing the supplier’s local footprint in the Spanish iGaming market, which is of increasing importance to providers of content, as financial results continue to go up, despite tough regulations.</p>
<p>"Collaborating with CasinoBarcelona.es means our games can be enjoyed by even more Spanish players," Shvartz noted. The partnership was welcomed on a similarly positive note by CasinoBarcelona.es Country Manager Alfredo Vega who said the company was happy to add more quality content to its library.</p>
<p>"The integration of these games will be a huge addition to our platform and we are sure the partnership will be beneficial for both parties going forward," he noted. Spinomenal has been growing at a good pace in Europe, having successfully moved across a number of markets recently.</p>
<p>The supplier has signed a string of partnerships in different jurisdictions across the continent, including efbet and 8888 in Bulgaria. The company also expanded in the Baltics with Optibet, as the supplier continues to pursue growth in what it considers to be lucrative and promising future and existing markets.</p>
<p>Earlier in January, Spinomenal made its debut in Hungary, another coveted European iGaming jurisdiction that is growing rapidly and attracting supplier and operator interest from all across the sector.</p>
