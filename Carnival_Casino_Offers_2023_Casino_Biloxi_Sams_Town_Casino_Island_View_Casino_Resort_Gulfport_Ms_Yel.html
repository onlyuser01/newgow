<p>Week 1 of the 2023 NFL brings us many exciting matchups, with one that perhaps stands out the most is the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Cleveland Browns game or the “Battle of Ohio,” which will take place on Sunday afternoon at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals lead the all-time series against the Cleveland Browns 52-47 with their most recent win happening in their most recent duel last December. What’s interesting is that it was their first win over their Ohio rivals since the start of the Joe Burrow era in Cincinnati. In fact, the Bengals quarterback is 1-4 against the Browns, but the betting odds suggest he’ll get his second win in the Battle of Ohio this coming Sunday.</p>

<p>Cincinnati Bengals Dreaming Big in 2023</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals feel as if the time has come for them to win their first-ever Super Bowl. Led by QB Joe Burrow – who could become the highest-paid player in the history of the NFL – they look capable of doing very well in 2023.</p>
<p>Obviously, Burrow is their most important player, but this season, the “cats” look strong in many other areas. In fact, one may argue that they do not have a weak spot this season. Of course, that remains to be seen when they go on the field on Sunday, but based solely on how their roster looks, they’re in for big stuff in 2023.</p>
<p>BREAKING: Joe Burrow and the Bengals are nearing a 5-year, $53 million AAV contract extension, per sources. The deal would make Burrow the highest-paid player in NFL history. $265 million guaranteed, $100 million signing bonus, $15 million roster bonus each year. pic.twitter.com/jludBks3M7 — Mr. RedDey (@UDCincyFan) September 6, 2023</p>
<p>These guys did a great job strengthening their roster in the offseason, with the signing of Super Bowl LVII-winning offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. being their standout move. If he plays the way he did as a Kansas City Chiefs player, Burrow will get the much-needed protection, which in turn, will make him even more dangerous than before.</p>
<p>In the previous duel with the Browns, Burrow went 18-for-33 for 239 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. With Brown Jr. as his bodyguard, he’s bound to do better this time. Or is he? Not if you’re asking Cleveland’s pass rushers.</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns Look Much Better than Last Year</p>
<p>The Browns’ strongest weapon for the past couple of seasons has been their pass rush. Myles Garrett is one of the best defensive ends in the league, the evidence being that he’s a four-time Pro Bowler.</p>
<p>In 2023, Garrett has a pass-rushing partner who could take Cleveland’s defense to a whole new level. The man in question is Za’Darius Smith who signed for the Browns in the offseason after a brilliant season with the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Apart from making their defense better, the Browns have also made a couple of nice acquisitions in the offensive team. Wide receivers Elijah Moore and Marquise Goodwin have arrived in Ohio, thus adding another option for the QB Deshaun Watson to aim his passes at. Of course, his No. 1 target is going to be Amari Cooper, who’s one of the best ball catchers in the NFL.</p>
<p>Still, Cleveland’s strongest offensive weapon is probably running back Nick Chubb who’s coming off a record-breaking season that saw him record 1,525 rushing yards – his career best.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Cleveland Browns Prediction</p>
<p>History teaches us that all sorts of weird stuff happen in Week 1. That’s why we don’t think the Bengals are going to get the job done routinely. In fact, we suspect they might not even win. That’s why our top pick for the Bengals vs. Browns Week 1 game is Browns +2.5.</p>
<p>Pick: Cleveland Browns +2.5</p>
