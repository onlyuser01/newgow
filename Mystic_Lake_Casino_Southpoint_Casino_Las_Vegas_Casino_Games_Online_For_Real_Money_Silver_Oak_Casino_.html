<p>NetEnt debuts Perfect Blackjack title.</p>
<p>The game was developed in partnership with Grosvenor Casinos.</p>
<p>Customers can expect a number of new and neat features.</p>
<p>Netent has recently enriched its Live casino games portfolio with the addition of its Perfect Blackjack title. The Swedish online casino software providers’ new title has now been rolled out across its operator network. Going forward, the customers will be able to access the unique Live titles that not only offers a return-to-player of 99.5 percent but also allows them to learn the perfect strategy. With its very sympathetic 0.5 percent house edge the game is set to continuously deal players the ‘ideal hand’. This will then allow them to “follow, watch and learn flawless strategy.”</p>
<p>Amazing Game Features</p>
<p>The mobile-friendly Perfect Blackjack is the first of its kind and an “acquisition-focused” game. It makes its debut just a few weeks after the NetEnt rolled out an improved user interface for its vast portfolio of live-dealer title. Of all of the games in NetEnt’s portfolio, Perfect Blackjack is the only live dealer blackjack game that offers an optional auto-play functionality. The functionality will allow players to pre-select whether to double down or auto-split. All these are designed to boost player experience by adding an element of speed to the game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the blackjack-based title also enables more scalability and flexibility through the inclusion of multi-seat and multiple players per box. These are further complemented by the inclusion of side bets such as perfect pair.</p>
<p>“Launching Perfect Blackjack onto the full NetEnt Live customer network means that players with all our live casino partners will be able to be introduced to and enjoy the benefits of the optimal strategy. Beyond that, this is an innovative game that brings something truly different to the live casino market and we have seen that it’s an entertaining and popular product,” said Andres Rengifo, the director of NetEnt Live.</p>
<p>Perfect Blackjack was first showcased at the ICE alongside several other high-ranking NetEnt Live casino game titles. Unsurprisingly it is already living to all the hype that was created around it.</p>
<p>Partnership with Grosvenor</p>
<p>NetEnt developed Perfect Blackjack in collaboration with renowned British gambling operator The Rank Group and its Grosvenor Casinos brand. The partnership deal between the companies was certainly a very lucrative one. NetEnt already has a strong presence in the global online gambling market while the Grosvenor Casinos brand is the channel casino operator in the United Kingdom. The casino brand boasts of multiple land-based gaming and entertainment facilities as well as a number of online gambling operations.</p>
<p>Since its debut in the mid-90s NetEnt has been a leading force in the online gaming market thanks to its remarkable offerings and its dedication to driving innovation in the industry. With the new title, its customers have once again been given the opportunity to get way ahead of the competition.</p>
