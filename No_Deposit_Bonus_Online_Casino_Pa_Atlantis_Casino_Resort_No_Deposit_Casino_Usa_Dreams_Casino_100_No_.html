Overcoming the state’s regulatory challenges allows the company to offer its exciting gaming content to players, advancing its regional expansion ambitions. This move should open the door for a new strategic partnership, bolstering Light &amp; Wonder’s impressive momentum.</p>
<p>Michigan Players Can Enjoy Exciting New Content</p>
<p>Playzido is an innovative gaming platform acquired by Light &amp; Wonder last year. It offers flexible and robust technology designed to cater to independent studios. Playzido supports a wide range of offerings, including multiplayer games and jackpots. Operators in Michigan can now tap into this dynamic platform to access a wealth of content previously unavailable in the US.</p>
<p>Players in Michigan can look forward to enjoying an array of captivating games as Playzido goes live in the state. Some of the initial titles set to launch through this platform include:</p>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder Capitalizes on Its Acquisitions</p>

Light &amp; Wonder iGaming Head of US Commercial Dana Jackel was optimistic that the Michigan launch would further bolster the company’s global appeal.</p>
