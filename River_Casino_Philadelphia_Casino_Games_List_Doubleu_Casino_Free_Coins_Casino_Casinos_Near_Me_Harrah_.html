<p>Experts in sports integrity Sportradar Integrity Services (SIS) announced today that Swedish gambling regulator Spelinspektionen signed an agreement to utilize its monitoring and detection capabilities.</p>
<p>Monitor Competitions, Flag Suspicious Events</p>
<p>The new agreement between Sportradar’s integrity arm and the gambling regulatory body in Sweden will allow SIS to monitor a range of sports and competitions in the country utilizing its Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS), and flag to Spelinspektionen any events suspicious of match-fixing.</p>
<p>“Through the information we will receive via Sportradar, we [will] increase our knowledge of match-fixing that we can use in, among other things, our regulatory work.” Daniel Frisö-Grön, Investigator, Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>The agreement with SIS will also provide Spelinspektionen with the opportunity to work with the integrity arm of the global supplier of sports data on initiatives related to the assessment of the risk of manipulations in certain sports.</p>
<p>“It also gives us opportunities to expand the exchange of information with sports and the police within the framework of our collaboration against match-fixing.” Daniel Frisö-Grön, Investigator, Spelinspektionen</p>
<p>Combining sophisticated mathematical models with machine learning, the UFDS is the preferred integrity protection tool for sports leagues, organizations and governing bodies around the world.</p>
<p>Independently assessed and verified by recognized sports betting and integrity experts, the system provides visibility into potential match-fixing, having flagged over 6,000 suspicious matches in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Earlier in March, Sportradar reported a record number of match-fixing signals generated by the UFSD in 2021, 903, registered across ten different sports and a total of 76 countries. The 2021 total surpassed the previous record of 883 signals of foul play generated in 2018.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Europe is the scene of some of the biggest sports tournaments and championships, 525 of the suspicious signals were generated on the continent and SIS was adamant that match-fixing remained a threat to the integrity of competitions.</p>
<p>Expanding Presence to Protect Integrity of Sports</p>
<p>The agreement with Spelinspektionen marked the first integrity deal with a national sports betting and gaming regulator in 2022, as SIS teamed with several sports organizations, including Athletes Unlimited, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), and the Canadian Hockey League (CHL).</p>
<p>Last month, Sportradar Integrity Services teamed with Athletes Unlimited in a multi-year integrity services deal in North America. The agreement also outlined the growing share of women’s sports in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Besides deploying its UFSD, Sportradar agreed to provide education and prevention services, conduct an integrity audit, and engage in intelligence and investigation services in collaboration with the sports organization.</p>
