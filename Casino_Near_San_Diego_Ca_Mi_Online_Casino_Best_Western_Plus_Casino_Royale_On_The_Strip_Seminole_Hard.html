    <h1>Casino Near San Diego Ca Mi Online Casino Best Western Plus Casino Royale On The Strip Seminole Hard</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I made two withdrawals via bank transfer of $6k each on 9 May 2023 which have since been marked as "accepted" however these funds have not been paid into my bank account. It has been more than a week for the first withdrawal and 3 days for the second since being processedas accepted. I have contacted support and my VIP manager which contine to respond with automatic replys saying that withdrawals need to be checked against fraud even though they have been marked as accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I set a cooling off period on my account. During this period I was allowed to access the blackjack table 7 and gamble and lose $8,900. I should not be able to access the games while in a cooling off period. Again support and amd my VIP manager have been made aware of this and no action has been taken. This occurred 4 days ago.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I appreciate your help with these two issues.</p>
