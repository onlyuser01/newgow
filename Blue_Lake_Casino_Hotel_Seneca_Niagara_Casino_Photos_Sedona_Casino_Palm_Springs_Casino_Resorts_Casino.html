<p>Las Vegas NAACP Adds Its Voice in Support of Embattled Judge Erika Ballou</p>

<p>The Las Vegas chapter of the NAACP has joined the chorus of supporters defending a local judge who was asked to resign. The local police union made the demand after Judge Erika Ballou stated comments to a defendant the officers viewed as anti-police.</p>

<p>In a statement released this week, the NAACP said the judge’s words “reflect the grim reality for African Americans” in Clark County and elsewhere in the US, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>Her statements reflect not only her truths but also the community’s truth,” the NAACP said in its response. “People of color and African Americans in particular are disproportionally killed by police.”</p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2021, some 31% of the individuals shot by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police (LVMPD) officers were Black, KTNV, a local TV station, reported. Blacks make up roughly 10% of the population in Nevada, the 2020 census revealed. Nevada state government statistics for 2021 claim Blacks committed 52.7% of violent crimes.</p>
<p>“Nothing in Judge Ballou’s statements were untrue, and the LVPPA’s position on this issue reflects its defensiveness based partly on the fact that the truth hurts,” the NAACP said.</p>
<p>But last week, the Las Vegas Police Protective Association (LVPPA) said the judge’s comments were “unethical and irresponsible.”</p>
<p>Ballou Court Statement Leads to Controversy</p>
<p>During a recent hearing, Ballou told a man to avoid being near police.</p>
<p>You’re a Black man in America, you know you don’t want to be nowhere where cops are,” Ballou said during the hearing. “You listen to me, you know you don’t want to be nowhere where cops are. Because I know I don’t, and I’m a middle-aged, middle-class Black woman. I don’t want to be around where the cops are because I don’t know if I’m going to walk away alive or not.”</p>
<p>The unnamed defendant allegedly committed battery against a police officer, according to official reports. Before this hearing, he had been placed on probation. Prosecutors were trying to end the probationary period.</p>
<p>After reports of Ballou’s comments, the police union posted on Twitter that the judge “imposed an adequate sentence” on the defendant and called for the judge to resign.</p>
<p>The NAACP rejected the police union’s demand that Ballou is to be scrutinized by a judicial ethics investigation.</p>
<p>Ballou also rejected the LVPPA’s allegation.</p>
<p>I support proper law enforcement,” Ballou told Casino.org. in a statement last week.</p>
<p>“What the record shows is that I communicate with those who appear before me in a manner that is straightforward and understandable,” Ballou continued.</p>
<p>Social Media Shows Support</p>
<p>Similar support for Ballou came from posters on Casino.org.</p>
<p>“She isn’t telling any lies,” Ed posted on the site. “Police unions should be held financially responsible for the settlements cities pay out for police misdeeds.”</p>
<p>I applaud this judge and any other judge trying to make a difference in how the police use their weapons,” Chris Wood posted on Casino.org “…im not black but have treated … recklessly by the police without giving them reason…thanks judge Ballou!”</p>
<p>The ACLU of Nevada and the Clark County Black Caucus released other statements supporting the judge recently.</p>
<p>The police union did not respond to requests for additional comment.</p>
