<p>Safer Gambling Week 2023 is set to make a significant impact from November 13 to November 19, as the UK gambling industry unites to advocate for responsible gaming practices</p>
<p>Organized by the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), BACTA, and the Bingo Association, this annual event aims to intensify efforts in promoting responsible gambling, focusing on showcasing available tools that empower customers to stay in control and providing assistance to those seeking help and advice.</p>
<p>UK Gambling Minister Stresses Collaborative Efforts for Safer Gambling</p>
<p>UK Gambling Minister Stuart Andrew emphasized the collaborative efforts of the government, industry, and the regulator in preventing harm. He highlighted the measures outlined in the white paper, designed to protect those most at risk of gambling-related harm while ensuring a safe gambling environment for those who choose to participate.</p>
<p>Andrew Rhodes, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “Safety should be at the heart of all gambling at all times. But Safer Gambling Week affords the unique opportunity to draw even more attention to its importance. It also provides the opportunity for operators to share best practices and ensure people in Britain are provided with the safest gambling opportunities in the world.”</p>
<p>Building on the success of the 2022 event, where over 200,000 accounts set deposit limits in October, marking a 12.5% increase from the previous year, this year’s campaign aims to further raise awareness. Notably, 61% of those setting deposit limits were first-time limit setters. The use of reality check alerts, and monitoring play duration, witnessed a remarkable 300% increase, and social media engagement soared to nearly 30 million impressions on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, a 21% increase from 2021.</p>
<p>Industry Leaders Emphasize Safer Gambling Week’s Impact on Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>Safer Gambling Week promotes initiatives such as encouraging deposit limits, time-outs, and directing customers to various self-exclusion services. It serves as a catalyst for businesses and organizations to engage in conversations about responsible gambling, not only with staff and customers but also with friends and family.</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, highlighted the significance of Safer Gambling Week in promoting vital safer gambling tools unique to the regulated betting and gaming sector. He emphasized the commitment to empowering customers with knowledge and tools for safe betting throughout the year.</p>
<p>John White, chief executive of BACTA, emphasized that Safer Gambling Week provides an opportunity to showcase the year-round efforts of the gambling sector in ensuring customers can enjoy recreational wagering safely. The united front presented during Safer Gambling Week underscores the industry’s dedication to responsible gaming advocacy and safer practices.Microgaming, a prominent online gaming platforms and services provider, is also actively supporting Safer Gambling Week.</p>
