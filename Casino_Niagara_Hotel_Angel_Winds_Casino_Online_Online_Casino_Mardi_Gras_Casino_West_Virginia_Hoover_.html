<p>Northern Sky review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, are a well known phenomenon that occurs as one gets closer and closer to the Arctic. Northern Sky uses this to create a stellar backdrop for its crystalline symbols. Bears, Caribou, Snowy Owls and Wolves inhabit the reels, rendered in a gorgeous diamond-esque style.</p>
<p>In the background a mountain rises towering out of snowy forests and the stars twinkle waiting for the bonus feature to trigger, bringing with it the aurora in all its colourful glory.</p>
<p>Hit at least one new symbol on any winline and you are guaranteed a respin</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The slot is a near perfect demonstration of how to build the visual and sound elements of a slot. The theme is strong, clear, and present in every visual detail. The symbols are beautiful and detailed, but also have strong silhouettes that make for easy-to-read reels at all magnifications.</p>
<p>Bigger cumulative wins are failry usual in the bonus round</p>
<p>The animations are simple but pretty, and they are timed to elicit that little bit of extra excitement when you land a win, or just miss a bonus symbol.</p>
<p>The sound, too, is well designed, building in time with the action and really drawing the player in.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Northern Sky is played on five reels with three rows and nine win lines.</p>
<p>Any winning combination pays out and then locks that combination in place for a free respin. Respins continue until no further winning combinations occur. The winnings are then paid out and the round ends.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in Northern Sky.</p>
<p>If you are lucky, you'll collect scatter symbols throughout the respin rounds</p>
<p>The Bonus feature is triggered when three bonus symbols land anywhere and at any time in one round (a round includes free respins). The Bonus round consists of ten free spins with only the high paying animal symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.57%, slightly over our yardstick of 96.00%.</p>
<p>Northern Sky - top paying symbols</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, allowing it to pair decently well with our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Since the bets are not made on a "per win line" basis the range of bet on the site we tested went from the minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 all the way up to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€100.00. This is a very satisfying spread of bets.</p>
<p>Northern Sky - low paying symbols in the base game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Northern Sky does a fantastic job at the visual level. Luckily, this is also backed up under the hood, with excellent pacing and a respin mechanic that makes every win feel like a bonus round.</p>
<p>The return to player is above average and the volatility is within the kind of range we feel happy recommending.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great slot that we recommend to our readers wholeheartedly.</p>
