<p>After losing 1-0 to Dortmund in Germany three weeks ago, Chelsea welcome their German foes at Stamford Bridge in a Champions League rematch</p>
<p>When you invest more than $600 million in players, you want to see some results. That’s exactly what Chelsea’s owner Todd Boehly demands from his team, but the Blues keep disappointing. Nevertheless, they do still stand a chance to advance to the next stage of the Champions League. For that to happen, they need to beat Dortmund on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Chelsea Going All-In on Tuesday</p>
<p>The Blues have been horrible over the last couple of months, but they still have a chance to salvage the season. They stand a decent chance to advance to the quarterfinal of the 2022-23 Champions League.</p>
<p>After losing just 1-0 to Dortmund in Germany, the Blues can book their ticket to the next stage with a win on Tuesday. We say “just” because Dortmund are great when playing at Westfalen, so losing by just one goal isn’t too bad.</p>
<p>The big question is can Chelsea win in the rematch? They definitely have the manpower to pull it off. Since American businessman Todd Boehly bought the club, Chelsea have invested more than $600 million on transfers. The Blues’ roster is packed with amazing players, but they still haven’t clicked. Maybe they will click on Tuesday?</p>
<p>Dortmund Looking for Their Sixth Straight Away Win</p>
<p>Dortmund have been in fabulous form, both at home and on the road. In away matches, they’re 5-0 this season in all competitions. There is a caveat, however. They haven’t played against too many teams that are as strong as Chelsea.</p>
<p>They did beat the Blues in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16. However, it happened on their turf, and if we’re being honest, they weren’t too great in that game. In fact, they had only two shots at goal, one of which went in.</p>
<p>Dortmund players did well at the back in that game. Chelsea had eight shots at goal, but BVB’s goalie Gregor Kobel managed to keep a clean sheet.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs Dortmund Prediction</p>
<p>In their first duel, the Blues were the dominant side, creating plenty of scoring chances. Unfortunately for them, they failed to make them count. This time, however, we think they will get on target. They’ll have their fans to cheer them on to victory.</p>
<p>Pick: Chelsea to win</p>
