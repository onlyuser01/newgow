    <h1>Palms Resort And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Gsn Casino Ragingbull Casino Casinos In Rhode Island Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>let me start from the beginning.</p>
<p>You posted that:</p>
<p>"I didn't know I had an account already!!! I've only ever played with my new email address and never with the old one!"</p>
<p>So I lastly replied: "Just keep in mind that you violated the rules in the first place. Sad but true."</p>
<p>That's what I mean. I also wrote that:</p>
<p>"We always try to push casinos a little bit further and ask them to consider whether the player gained some advantage by creating another account."</p>
<p>As a reason for submitting the complaint.</p>
<p>Your second question is "Why was I paid by the casino?" I don't know, but I already commented that:</p>
<p>"I hope we could remind the casino that they made a mistake too so they should try to be friendly and reconsider voiding the winnings at full."</p>
<p>As a second reason for submitting the complaint.</p>
<p>The third question is "Do you think all my withdrawals have been successful?" Yes, except the last one. And this is the final reason for submitting the complaint.</p>
<p>Honestly, I do not understand what's happening and why you gave up â‚¬4000 winnings to unblock your account. Sorry, it does not make any sense to me.</p>
<p>I was hoping we can reason with the casino and save maybe even your winnings, but this is not possible now, I guess.</p>
<p>I also didn't get the part about blackmailing:</p>
<p>"In any case, I consider this to be blackmail!"</p>
<p>As far as I understand, you've already agreed to the proposition, am I right?</p>
