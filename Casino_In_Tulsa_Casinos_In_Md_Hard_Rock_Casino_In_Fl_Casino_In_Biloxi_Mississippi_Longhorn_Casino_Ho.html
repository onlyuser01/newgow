<p>A 106-year-old woman won twice the amount of her slots jackpot last week after Wisconsin’s Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino gave her an extra special birthday present.</p>

<p>Serafina “Sarah” Papia Peterson hit a $1K jackpot on her own last Wednesday at the Milwaukee gaming property.</p>
<p>Casino management was thrilled with the win, and when the casino’s CEO heard about her jackpot on Friday, he chose to double the amount.</p>
<p>“We were all elated when we heard about her big win, and wanted to make her 106th birthday even more special,” casino CEO Dominic Ortiz told Milwaukee TV station WISN.</p>
<p>Peterson, too, was elated.</p>
<p>I’m happy to win this money,” Peterson was quoted by WISN. “I don’t know what I’m going to do with it, but I’m going to make a good choice.”</p>
<p>Turns out the win was actually because of an accident. Peterson’s niece, Marge Larson, told Milwaukee TV station WDJT that her aunt pressed 400 rather than the intended 50.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, we see ‘jackpot,’ and we looked down,” Larson recalled.</p>
<p>I told my niece I thought I was going to win today but never thought I’d receive a surprise like this,” Peterson added to Fox News.</p>
<p>Peterson is a casino regular who has celebrated her birthday at the gaming property for many years.</p>
<p>“We’ve welcomed Sarah every year for her birthday and are grateful that she and her family celebrate with us,” Ortiz said.</p>
<p>Last week’s birthday celebration for Peterson included a custom-baked cake from the casino and the birthday girl wore a sash to mark the occasion. She also was given a sweatshirt from Cream City Coffee.</p>
<p>The secrets to her longevity? Peterson neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. She says her dog, Happy, keeps her going, too.</p>
<p>I want to live for my dog, he’s not a dog, he’s a person,” Peterson told WDJT. “He takes good care of me.”</p>
<p>Also, her relatives and caregivers take good care of her.</p>
<p>“That’s what means a lot,” she added. “That they love me. Everybody loves me and I love them too.”</p>
<p>Peterson has always lived in the Milwaukee area, though she resides in Menomonee Falls, Wis.</p>
<p>She never thought she would reach 106, but she’s happy she’s reached the milestone.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived a good life, that’s all I can say,” Peterson said.</p>
<p>Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino Pays Out $1.3M</p>
<p>A mystery player from Southern California won a jackpot worth more than $1.3M at Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino at San Manuel, Calif. on Thursday.</p>
<p>The total payout was $1,315,761.19 and the lucky winner collected her winnings after betting $25 while playing the Dragon Link Panda Magic slot.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to share in the joy with one of our lucky Club Serrano members, following an amazing win last night,” Kenji Hall, general manager at Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino, told California’s KBIG radio station following the win. “We strive to create once-in-a-lifetime moments for all our patrons across the resort every day … last night’s $1.3M jackpot win is an unforgettable moment for all of us.”</p>
<p>Caesars Palace Player Collectively Wins Over $2M</p>
<p>An unnamed player at Caesars Palace Las Vegas won 10 jackpots earlier this month over two days.</p>
<p>The exact total was $2,072,831. The wins were on August 19 and 20, with the player winning five times each day.</p>
<p>The player won $1,052,500 on the 19th and an additional $1,020,331 on the following day, according to a statement from Caesars Entertainment. There’s no word on what the lucky winner will do with the cash.</p>
