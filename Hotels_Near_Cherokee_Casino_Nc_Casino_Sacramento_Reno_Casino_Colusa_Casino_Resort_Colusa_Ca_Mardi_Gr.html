<p>Please note that this email only confirms that you were self-excluded from that specific casino. Unfortunately, there is not written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>The vast majority of casinos are not able to block players before they make an account. Unless you received some confirmation from the casino that they could do this for you and prevent you from creating accounts in the future in this or any sister casino, there is nothing we can do and we don't think you are entitled to any refunds.</p>
<p>Since your account has already been closed, we are not able to assist you further. If you disagree with our decision, you can always try contacting the licensing authority as they have more tools and options to help.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also offer the option to utilize our Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool. This tool allows you to block your casino accounts across multiple gambling establishments simultaneously and is not affiliated with any specific casino. The Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool was designed to assist individuals who may be facing challenges with their gambling habits by helping them limit their access to gambling and reduce the potential for further harm.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
