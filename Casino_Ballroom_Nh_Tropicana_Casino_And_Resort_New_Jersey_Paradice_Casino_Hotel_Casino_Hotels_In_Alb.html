    <h1>Casino Ballroom Nh Tropicana Casino And Resort New Jersey Paradice Casino Hotel Casino Hotels In Alb</h1>

<p>I had my account closed I asked for it to be closed at casino extreme after they didn't like when I won a few times and then took away all my bonuses and said that I was abusing it even though I had made a dozen deposits in a week prior and had only one withdrawal they do this because they didn't want to pay cuz all their jackpots hit at the same time. Along with their sister company casino brango. So they took away on my bonuses and they treated me like crap after years of depositing there so I asked him to close my account and I decided to give them another try and when I went back my username and password would not function it's as if my account was gone until being that's the case and I'm only allowed to have one active account and that's what it says not one account just one active account and I did only have one active account and I did not accept any new welcome bonuses I made a new account because I didn't have any access to the previous one so what the hell am I supposed to do. After I made the new account I did not accept any welcome offers I made a deposit and they apprehended that deposit and claimed I needed to now re-verify myself and I did the department for documents got back to me this morning saying that they would like my LTC address so that they could send me the refund of my deposit and they refuse to do it because doggy is a piece of sh*t and a thief and he's the one who was in charge of casino adrenaline when they stole my money too and so he doesn't like me but I don't like him either and I don't really give a shit what he likes is a business you have childish pussy. The point is is he's not returning my deposit and he refuses to answer I jump through the hoops there department of documents said I was reverified and that they wanted me to send Dougie The pit Boss the shit boss in my opinion a message regarding my LTC address which I did and he refuses to pay me what he owes me I just want my deposit back and I hope he burns in hell.</p>
