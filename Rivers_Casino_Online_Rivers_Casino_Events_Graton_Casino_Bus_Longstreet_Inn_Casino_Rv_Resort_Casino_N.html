    <h1>Rivers Casino Online Rivers Casino Events Graton Casino Bus Longstreet Inn Casino Rv Resort Casino N</h1>

<p>Hello, today I have made five deposits for a total of 440€ on n1bet.com and the reason for my complaint is the second deposit of 100€ / withdrawal of 500€</p>
<p>. Every deposit I made was raw cash and the only bonus I would get is one GOLD lucky spin for every 100€ deposit. So I made a deposit of 100€ and received a Gold lucky spin reward of 10€ with a 5x wager requirement and started playing blackjack. I played 13 hands of blackjack, wagering a total of 610€ before deciding to call it quits at 500€ balance. However it would not let me withdraw because the wager for the Gold reward was brokeneven though I had wagered over 10 times more than was required already. Feeling accomplished with my raw cash blackjack run I feel I dont need the broken 10€ gold reward chip because I could not withdraw it anyways since the wager is broken.(notice I wagered 610€ yet here it freezes at 30) so I remove it to cash out 490€ however instead of it removing my 10€ reward chip it removed my entire balance and when talking to their support they say they cant do anything because I cancelled it even though I had finished the wager already. Please help me casinoguru</p>
