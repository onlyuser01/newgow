<p>Provider of gambling and lottery solutions International Game Technology (IGT) officially announced its multi-products systems technology agreement with Harrington Raceway and Casino in Delaware.</p>
<p>Optimizing the Gaming Floor</p>

<p>Commenting on the multi-product deal, Harrington Raceway and Casino general manager Mark Schrecengost outlined the casino property would be modernizing its gaming floor, implementing an IGT ADVANTAGE upgrade, and would further introduce the supplier’s TournXtreme, Mobile Host and Mobile Responder solutions.</p>
<p>“IGT ADVANTAGE has been the backbone of our casino for many years, and we’re excited to enter a new era of our systems partnership with IGT via solutions that will help us boost productivity and service, elevate our guests’ play and loyalty and position us for growth.” Mark Schrecengost, General Manager, Harrington Raceway and Casino</p>
<p>The raceway and casino property in Delaware will deploy the latest iteration of IGT’s casino management system, IGT ADVANTAGE, under the terms of the agreement to help the venue upgrade its gaming floor.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, IGT announced an agreement with Nustar Resorts and Casino in Cebu in the Philippines to deploy its ADVANTAGE casino management system at the casino property when it opens to the public later this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Harrington Raceway and Casino will introduce IGT’s tournament technology TournXtreme to offer guests video slot tournaments and enable speedy conversions between cash-in and tournament modes for gaming machines.</p>
<p>IGT will also deploy its Mobile Host and Mobile Responder apps to help the casino property boost its performance and productivity by cutting response times to floor incidents, utilizing real-time slot incident updates delivered to personal mobile devices.</p>
<p>Ryan Reddy, senior vice president at IGT, emphasized the opportunity for Harrington Raceway and Casino to “quickly make a positive impact” on its productivity and customer satisfaction via the deployment of IGT’s system products.</p>
<p>“By deploying multiple IGT systems solutions concurrently, Harrington Raceway and Casino can achieve peak value from their systems investment, operate with agility and seamlessly adopt new and emerging gaming trends in the future.” Ryan Reddy, SVP, Global PMM VLT, Systems, Video Poker and Payments, IGT</p>
<p>The multi-system deal will also see a phased deployment of several other of IGT’s solutions, including its HTML-based service window content management tool M5 to empower Harrington Raceway and Casino with personalized in-game offers, bonuses and rewards, the Bonus Box bonus application bundle with bonuses such as Lucky Coin, Slot Lotto and Lucky Draw, as well as AVENTO, the new hardware platform supporting mobile loyalty card technology Cardless Connect, the cashless solution Resort Wallet, and plenty of in-game content.</p>
