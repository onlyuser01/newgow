<p>Dinopolis review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dinopolis has a fantasy dinosaur theme with a glitzy Las Vegas setting.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves in an alternate universe where dinosaurs are running around Vegas with glamorous flair. With a toss of the dice, players will get caught up in a world populated by prehistoric animals.</p>
<p>This game is a good fit for dinosaur-lovers who are in the mood for a vintage casino atmosphere.</p>
<p>Big win in the Dinopolis slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The toe-tapping soundtrack is filled with rollicking piano notes that will make players feel like they’ve stumbled into a retro dance club.</p>
<p>The animation has a high quality cartoon aesthetic, and the backdrop is particularly striking with its violet hued vision of Las Vegas. Searchlights gently sway in the sky, illuminating the glittering city.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see a selection of their favorite dinosaurs, all dressed to impress in suits and cocktail dresses. Some hold elegant cigarettes, others cards, and one frenzied triceratops clutches wads of cash.</p>
<p>Also among the symbols are glowing dice, poker chips, and colourful cards. These all uphold the flashy Las Vegas aesthetic.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create an original world of dino-Vegas fun.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Dinopolis has a 3-4-4-4-3 reel structure. Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. A multiplier of x2 or x3 may be attached to a Wild when it lands.</p>
<p>Dino Coin symbols are awarded to the player when they form a 3 of a kind (or more) combo along with Wild symbols. The player is awarded a prize equal to their current bet multiplied by the number shown on the Dino Coin symbol, and then multiplied by any Wild multipliers that are included in the winning combo.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4, and when players land three Scatters, the Dino Bonus feature begins.</p>
<p>When the Dino Bonus feature begins, players are presented with a selection of cards and invited to choose two. The first card the player chooses will award a prize, and the second card awards a number of free spins.</p>
<p>Card picking game before main bonus feature starts</p>
<p>Throughout the Dino Bonus feature, Dino Coin Collector symbols can appear on the reels, rather than regular Dino Coin symbols. These Dino Coin Collector symbols are accumulated in a meter and once this meter is filled, players are invited to the next level. The meter is full when 5 Dino Coin Collector symbols have been gathered.</p>
<p>When a new level of the Dino Bonus feature begins, players are once again offered a selection of cards to choose from and the process begins again.</p>
<p>The Sticky Stack Wild symbol covers the entire reel when it lands and may have an associated multiplier. After the Sticky Stack Wild appears, it remains on the reels throughout the Dino Bonus feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.4%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Dinopolis slot machine</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Dinopolis is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility dinosaur and Las Vegas-themed slot.</p>
<p>The robust RTP and ample volatility immediately make this game an attractive choice for mathematically minded players. Meanwhile, the delightfully glamorous dinosaur theme is unique and plenty of fun.</p>
