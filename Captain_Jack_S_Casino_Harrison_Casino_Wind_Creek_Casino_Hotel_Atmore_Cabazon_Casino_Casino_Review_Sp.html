<p>Thanks to White Label Game Studio, ELA Games will have the means to quickly deploy its upcoming games and ensure that it engages with audiences. The company is planning to go live with ten games at first, with four of these already live.</p>
<p>Spinomenal to Help ELA Games Empower New Slots Project</p>
<p>The four titles that have already been developed by ELA Games include Juicy Winter, Night of the Scarabs, Golden Rhino, and Gentlemans Club, among others. ELA Games is hoping to continue delivering fresh slot gameplay that is unmatched by other studios and projects.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new initiative, company product studio manager, Alexey Shulgin, had this to say:</p>
<p>Partnering with a well-known studio like Spinomenal and using its White Label Game Studio gives us the ideal technical foundation to create a series of entertaining slots. The first games are ready and we’re working hard on adding to the series this year. ELA Games product studio manager Alexey Shulgin</p>
<p>Spinomenal CCO Nir Ronen was similarly pleased with the development and said that the White Label Game Studio will prove as the right platform solution for ELA Games, as the company’s product helps slots creators excel at what they do.</p>
<p>Ronen noted that the technical expertise Spinomenal brought along with it is precisely what ELA Games would need to make the most of the next steps of project realization. ELA Games in the meantime has been enjoying a fairly prominent profile in the iGaming landscape, developing a number of immersive experiences.</p>
<p>ELA Game is similarly pleased to be teaming up with Spinomenal, citing the latter company’s own notable products, which include Majestic King, Wolf Fang, and Book of Rampage.</p>
