<p>You can't choose where you live ( Germany )</p>
<p>Hello Team Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I would like to tell you about a case that happened yesterday at the Ice Casino.</p>
<p>Haven't played in the casino for a long time and noticed that there is a duplicate account...</p>
<p>An operator then called for help because I A: wanted to change my phone number and to clear the duplicate account. I asked before I made deposits.</p>
<p>It takes a while and the lady asked me for my new number which she got, now I asked for the other account and was told not to leave the chat her request is being processed.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes later the lady got in touch and told me that the request to change the number was in progress to make sure I asked again whether the double account was gone and I could play normally with the main account "Wait a moment" Moment later I got the confirmation that everything was fine and that I could play and withdraw as normal.</p>
<p>Great, I then also deposited 40 € plus bonus, played this successfully and was also able to make a payout of 70 €, so I thought maybe even more could be done, had 700 € real money balance on it today at noon......</p>
<p>An hour later the account was blocked "duplicate account"</p>
<p>Again on request I only got the account locked again and again no reasonable conservation, I was urgently advised to unlock the account so that the entire balance is gone, my deposit too.</p>
<p>Is that legal??? Please help from you</p>
<p>my mail S***@web.de, so I was also registered in the Ice Casino.</p>
<p>Greetings Thomas</p>
