    <h1>Casino Downtown Chicago Casino In Houston Vave Casino Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Biloxi Ms Paris Las</h1>

<p>Dear Tomas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>We believe that a warning to users is included in our Terms and Conditions where the user agrees to become acquainted with the terms of any offers by creating an account and claiming any bonuses.</p>
<p>The bonus in question was claimed for the second time on April 15 at 7:36 am, however, no eligible deposit was made to claim the offer.</p>
<p>The user never used their bonus funds. The bonus is non-sticky therefore the user has to play with their deposit funds first and once they are exhausted the user can start to play with their bonus fund. After claiming the bonus in question the user placed a bet of 1,000 EUR (the full amount on which the bonus was claimed) on Lightning Roulette, Round ID for this round being 71409544125 which the user ultimately won. They still had the available bonus funds as a "safety net" in case the gameplay round had been settled as lost. After winning 1,850 EUR from said round, the user then cancelled the bonus.</p>
<p>We would like to once again stress on the fact that the user claimed a deposit bonus without making an eligible deposit first, which was a direct violation of our bonus Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, while it is obvious in the naming of our bonuses (Sports Bonus, Casino Bonus example) which sections the bonus is for, the terms and conditions clearly state that the bonus in question must be used on sports activities. As a gesture of goodwill on our part we have decided to return the winnings from the original reload bonus to the user, despite them having violated the terms of the bonus with mixed gameplay in the use of their first bonus.</p>
<p>The user's winnings from the first bonus are currently available for withdrawal.</p>
<p>We would like to thank you once again for bringing this matter to our attention, and we trust that you will reconsider this matter.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>CasinoMega.</p>
