<p>British sports media business Dazn Group announced Tuesday it entered into a strategic partnership with gaming industry platform and content provider Pragmatic Solutions to launch a new betting product for sports fans.</p>
<p>Emphasis on In-Play Recreational Betting</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement will see Dazn Group and Pragmatic Solutions establish a new business that will offer betting services under the Dazn Bet brand and will operate out of Gibraltar. The soft launch of the new sports betting brand and its beta product is planned to coincide with the start of the new football season in August 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the strategic partnership with Pragmatic Solutions, Dazn Group’s chief executive officer Shay Segev outlined the future of sports lies where media and betting converge.</p>
<p>“This historic partnership brings together the leading sports media company and a technology partner who is committed to developing innovative experiences for fans. It underscores DAZN’s commitment to revitalise the sports viewing experience by offering a broader spectrum of digital entertainment for fans.” Shay Segev, CEO, Dazn Group</p>
<p>The strategic partnership will utilize Dazn Group’s customer base for Dazn Bet via a licensing agreement, as well as Pragmatic Solution’s expertise in platform and content development. Pragmatic will also leverage its technological capabilities to continuously enhance the product and platform.</p>
<p>“It’s an honour for us to partner with DAZN. We know that fans want more integrated, immersive, and interactive experiences, and through our exclusive partnership with DAZN, we can deliver this.” Ashley Lang, CEO, Pragmatic Solutions</p>
<p>As Dazn audiences signaled a shift in preferences towards recreational in-play betting, the partnership plans to introduce an integrated sports betting experience for casual bettors that will enhance Dazn’s live sports streaming by launching products in both the play for fun and real money categories over the next few years.</p>
<p>Innovative Technology and Entrepreneurial Spirit</p>
<p>Providing proprietary technology solutions for the global gambling industry with a Player Account Management (PAM) modular platform offering scalability and connectivity via a single Application Programming Interface (API), Pragmatic Solutions was chosen to become a partner of Dazn Group due to its innovative and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>Pre-integrated with content from third parties and payment providers, and allowing for rapid new services integrations, the platform effectively manages operators’ trading risk and regulatory compliance while allowing operators flexibility in managing the marketing side of play and player experiences.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Solutions’ brand Pragmatic Play established itself as a content supplier of choice for gaming operators around the world, with the most recent agreements struck with businesses operating out of South Africa.</p>
