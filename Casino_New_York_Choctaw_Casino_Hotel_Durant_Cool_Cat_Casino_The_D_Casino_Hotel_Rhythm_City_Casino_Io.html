<p>Dear M1880,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible gambling section, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"WHAT IS SELF-EXCLUSION?</p>
<p>Setting Self-exclusion lets us know that we need to take all measures to block your access to your account and make sure that you receive no promotional materials. You may also contact our support team at support@pinocasino.com and inform us about your decision to stop gambling at the Website for a certain period of time or forever.</p>
<p>If you are self excluded from the casino you won't be able to log into your account and order withdrawal of any balance you have left. Once self-excluded, please reach out to our support team at support@pinocasino.com in order to initiate withdrawal of remaining balance. Our support team will contact you within a reasonable timeframe with information on the withdrawal and will assist you with it. Please note that active self-exclusion does not make you exempt from verification procedure if it's required by the casino to process funds. The funds remaining on balance will be paid according to the casino limits."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s not written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>However, based on your screenshots it seems that you already have an active self-exclusion in PinoCasino:</p>
<p>Could you please clarify why you submitted this complaint about PinoCasino? How should we help?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
