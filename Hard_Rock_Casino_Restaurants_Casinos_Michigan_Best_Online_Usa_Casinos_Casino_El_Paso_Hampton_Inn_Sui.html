    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Restaurants Casinos Michigan Best Online Usa Casinos Casino El Paso Hampton Inn Sui</h1>

<p>It all began in February this year. That was the first time I've wanted to withdraw a winning from WildTokyo.</p>
<p>The verification processes was the worst I've ever seen, it took WEEKS to verify my account and in the end I had to do a VIDEO SKYPE CALL with them. Are you serious? I was totally speechless but in a negative way.</p>
<p>Now I've won again on their site, my profile is fully verified, the payment method everything.</p>
<p>According to their terms it shouldn't take longer than 24 hours to withdraw the money.</p>
<p>Direct quote from their terms:</p>
<p>"- There is a limit of 3 simultaneous withdrawal requests. The maximum withdrawal limits per transaction / in 24 hours / month are determined as follows:</p>
<p>per transaction: 400 EUR or equivalent in other currency</p>
<p>in 24 hours: 400 EUR or equivalent in other currency"</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>"- All withdrawal requests are processed by the financial department within 24 hours after the successful identity and account verification, every days 9.00-18.00 (GMT+3)."</p>
<p>Well, after 3 days and still a pending withdrawal I wrote the financial department and got this message back:</p>
<p>"The casino administration reserves the right to make payments according to individual schedule, to set the minimum and maximum amount per one transaction and the time for this transaction, which may differ depending on the method of withdrawal, your account level or other relevant factors.</p>
<p>400 EUR will be executed on 04.11.2021</p>
<p>400 EUR will be executed on 09.11.2021</p>
<p>200 EUR will be executed on 12.11.2021"</p>
<p>Without any reason, they doing that on purpose so their is enough time that I spent the rest of my winnings on their site!</p>
<p>It's horrible how players are treated.</p>
<p>Hope you can help me.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Florian</p>
