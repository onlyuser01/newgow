<p>The leading sportsbook software and platform provider, Betby, has announced a new deal with aggregator Groove.</p>
<p>Aggregator Groove Joins Forces with Betby</p>
<p>Currently, Betby offers a variety of betting options on sporting events for sports fans every month. However, its leading sportsbook solution isn’t just an “out-of-the-box” product. Thanks to cutting-edge technology, Betby’s sportsbook solution is customizable based on the client’s needs.</p>
<p>Under the new deal with Groove, Betby will increase its array of betting options. Moreover, the new collaboration will help expand the market offering. The recent deal also complements Betby’s ongoing growth strategy. This year, the company launched its Betby.Games series while at the same time focused on offering extra functionality for its sportsbook solution and core business.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Groove currently has agreements with 70 gaming and betting companies. But thanks to the new collaboration with Betby, Groove will deliver additional innovative content for the global markets. Moreover, Groove provides an array of live casino, poker, and table games that are easy to integrate and boost fan engagement.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Will Bring Benefits for the Two Companies</p>
<p>Groove’s COO, Yahale Meltzer, acknowledged that the company is excited to provide its operator cluster with Betby’s new sports betting technology. He said that this integration will undoubtedly help improve the company’s relationships with its partners. Meltzer added that Groove has always been proud of delivering the best service possible. “Tying up with Betby will give us greater service scope than ever before on the sports betting front,” said Meltzer in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be able to provide our operator cluster with this new sports betting technology developed by Betby, which will further help to enhance our relationships.” Yahale Meltzer, COO at Groove</p>
<p>Betby’s CEO, Leonid Pertsovskiy, added that the company needs partners like Groove to continue growing internationally. Additionally, he acknowledged that Groove already has an established international network. According to Pertsovskiy, accessing Groove’s cluster of over 70 operators helps Betby get one step closer to its goal.</p>
<p>“To extend our international reach by the end of 2022 we need partners like Groove, who have an established international network and presence.” Leonid Pertsovskiy, CEO at Betby</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Betby joined forces with Digital Sports Tech (DST). The deal was completed in August and aimed at expanding Betby’s inventory of player prop betting markets. In September, the company completed another key deal. Betby teamed up with cricket to expand its variety of sports simulation events.</p>
