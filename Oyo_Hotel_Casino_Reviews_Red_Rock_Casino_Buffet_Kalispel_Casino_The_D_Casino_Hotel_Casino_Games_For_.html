<p>The company highlighted the efforts of its Anti-Fraud team that helped partner operators save money which otherwise would be lost to different fraud attempts</p>
<p>Fast-growing technology company offering solutions for the online gambling industry SOFTSWISS released a new report, outlining the performance of its Anti-Fraud team in 2022. The Anti-Fraud team, consisting of dedicated experts with years of experience, is a part of the company’s Managed Services, a solution that is famous for being at the intersection between the player and platform.</p>
<p>Last year was successful for SOFTSWISS’ Anti-Fraud team and its partner operators, considering that the efforts of the experts resulted in saving more than €16 million ($17.2 million). This result, when compared to the figures reported in 2021, marked an increase of 14%.</p>
<p>Overall, in 2022, there were 61,810 requests from 200 projects, which resulted in a year-on-year output increase of 53%, according to SOFTSWISS. The company explained that those results reaffirm the effectiveness of its technology and dedicated experts that ultimately helped the company’s clients save more money throughout the year.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Anti-Fraud team reported a significant number of activities. In fact, in Q4, 2022, the saved amount increased by hitting 88% growth when compared to the results from Q1, 2022.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS explained that bonus abuse represented the majority of the fraud attempts stopped by the experts from the team. Nearly 70% of the cases stopped were bonus abuse, while money laundering and payment system abuse cases represented 10% each.</p>
<p>The Anti-fraud Team Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Besides the outstanding results, 2022 marked an important year for the Anti-Fraud team as it secured multiple certifications. SOFTSWISS’ dedicated Anti-Fraud team secured two GamCare certificates, one DPP/DPM certificate, as well as two ACFE certifications last year.</p>
<p>Ilya Nesterau, SOFTSWISS’ Anti-Fraud team lead, acknowledged that 2022 was a successful year for the team that continues to fight against fraud and abuse within the sector. He added that the dedicated experts as part of the Anti-Fraud team are continuously growing and the team is now an important part of the company’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>“It has been an extremely positive year for the Anti-Fraud team in our fight against negative actors in the industry. Our team continues to expand at a rapid pace, with our headcount more than doubling in 2022, as we become an increasingly vital part of our infrastructure.“ Ilya Nesterau, Anti-Fraud team lead at SOFTSWISS</p>
<p>Nesterau added that the Anti-Fraud team collaborates with the Research and Development team to help build new fraud-detection tools. “From implementing neural networks to machine learning, we focus on being more proactive and forward-looking in our approach to work,” explained the Anti-Fraud team lead in conclusion.</p>
