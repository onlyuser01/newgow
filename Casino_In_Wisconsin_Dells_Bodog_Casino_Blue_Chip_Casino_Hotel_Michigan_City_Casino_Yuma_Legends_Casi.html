<p>The Letter of Arrangement demonstrates the two parties’ alignment on the importance of stopping match-fixing in esports</p>
<p>The Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) revealed that it has signed a Letter of Arrangement with the Victoria Police in February this year. Under the agreement, the two bodies will exchange information about suspicious betting activity in order to combat match-fixing in esports.</p>
<p>As outlined in the letter, the Victoria Police’s Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit (SIIU) will receive real-time betting alerts from ESIC, should the commission detect suspicious betting activity. As a body dedicated to protecting the integrity of esports, ESIC will continue its efforts to shield the sector from fraud.</p>
<p>Victoria Police’s SIIU, on the other hand, has been on the lookout for match-fixing cases since 2019 when it conducted the first Australian law enforcement investigation into match-fixing in esports. Back then, five men received charges for a range of offenses.</p>
<p>Victoria Police remains committed to protecting sporting events from match-fixing. Under the 2013 amendment to the Victorian Crimes Act, the corruption of the betting outcome of an event is a serious crime, including the manipulation of esports results.</p>
<p>Victoria Police Acknowledges the Dangers of Match-Fixing</p>
<p>Victoria Police’s intelligence and covert support command assistant commissioner Chris Gilbert said that the international aspect of sports and esports makes cracking down on match-fixing very complex.</p>
<p>However, the Letter of Arrangement will provide Victoria Police with valuable help and alerts from offshore gambling companies.</p>
<p>This Letter of Arrangement will see ESIC sharing real-time suspicious betting alerts – particularly from offshore wagering operators – with our detectives, allowing for investigations into suspected match-fixing to commence almost immediately. Chris Gilbert, intelligence and covert support command assistant commissioner, Victoria Police</p>
<p>Gilbert added that, sadly, esports players tend to be younger and therefore more vulnerable to approaches by criminal entities. In addition, the minimal prize money makes esports athletes more likely to engage in illicit activities.</p>
<p>Gilbert concluded that Victoria Police will continue to target the infiltration of esports by potential offenders and crime syndicates while fostering robust relationships with esports stakeholders and betting companies.</p>
<p>It’s important that people understand these are significant criminal offenses with substantial penalties and we will take any reports of suspicious activity seriously. Chris Gilbert, intelligence and covert support command assistant commissioner, Victoria Police</p>
<p>ESIC Welcomes the Opportunity to Work with Victoria Police</p>
<p>Stephen Hanna, ESIC’s director of global strategy, also expressed his thoughts on the matter. He said that the ESIC must work together with law enforcement agencies such as Victoria Police if it is to create a safe and risk-free environment for esports players and fans.</p>
<p>Hanna praised Victoria Police’s willingness to collaborate with the commission to prevent and deter match-fixing in esports.</p>
<p>Esports is a global industry that requires a global response to maintain integrity. By working together with law enforcement agencies, like Victoria Police, we can better identify and investigate suspicious betting activity and protect the integrity of esports competitions. Stephen Hanna, director of global strategy, ESIC</p>
<p>Hanna concluded that the Letter of Arrangement demonstrates the two parties’ alignment on the importance of stopping match-fixing in esports.</p>
