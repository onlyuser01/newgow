<p>The Kansas City Chiefs (+600 odds) and Philadelphia Eagles (+650) are the betting favorites to win Super Bowl LVIII at the onset of the NFL’s regular season.</p>

<p>The 2023 NFL season begins tonight, when the Chiefs host the Detroit Lions to kick off the season with the first Thursday Night Football game of the season.</p>
<p>Last year’s Super Bowl LVII participants — the Chiefs and Eagles — begin the new season as the top two betting favorites to win a championship this season according to DraftKings’ NFL futures board.</p>
<p>Super Bowl LVIII Odds</p>
<p>Team Odds Kansas City Chiefs +600 Philadelphia Eagles +650 Buffalo Bills +900 San Francisco 49ers +1000 Cincinnati Bengals +1100 Dallas Cowboys +1400 New York Jets +1600 Baltimore Ravens +1800 Detroit Lions +2200 Los Angeles Chargers +2500 Miami Dolphins +2500 Jacksonville Jaguars +3000 New Orleans Saints +3000 Seattle Seahawks +3000 Cleveland Browns +3500 Minnesota Vikings +3500 Denver Broncos +4500 Pittsburgh Steelers +5000 Chicago Bears +5000 Atlanta Falcons +6000 New York Giants +6500 Green Bay Packers +6500 New England Patriots +6500 Washington Commanders +6500 Las Vegas Raiders +8000 Carolina Panthers +8000 Los Angeles Rams +8000 Tennessee Titans +8000 Tampa Bay Bucs +10000 Indianapolis Colts +15000 Houston Texans +20000 Arizona Cardinals +40000</p>
<p>Even though the Chiefs’ top offensive weapon, tight end Travis Kelce, sustained a hyperextended knee this week in practice, the Chiefs are still the consensus favorite to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Betting: AFC Stacked</p>
<p>Five teams from the AFC occupy the top eight spots on the futures board. The so-called “Big 3” from the AFC this season are the Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, and Cincinnati Bengals. You can make a strong argument that any of those three teams are among the best teams in the entire NFL, let alone the AFC.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are +600 odds to win the Super Bowl. But it’s been nearly 20 years since a team won a championship in consecutive seasons. Of course, that last team was New England, with head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady key parts of winning back-to-back Super Bowls when the Patriots went the distance during the 2003 and 2004 seasons.</p>
<p>The Bills advanced to four-straight Super Bowls in the early 1990s, but fell short of the mark all four times. The Bills await a shot at redemption, and they’re third on the futures board at +900 odds.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals secured a trip to the Super Bowl two seasons ago, but they’d like another crack at a championship. The Bengals are fifth on the board at +1100 odds to win the Super Bowl. Even though quarterback Joe Burrow sustained a minor leg injury in the preseason, their odds did not change.</p>
<p>The New York Jets are a popular pick to win the Super Bowl at +1600 odds, thanks to the addition of quarterback Aaron Rodgers and a boost from appearing on HBO’s Hard Knocks reality series.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens are eighth overall on the board at +1800 odds. Everyone in Baltimore is excited at their revamped offense, which is why they’re in the top eight.</p>
<p>Eagles, Cowboys Lead NFC Betting Favorites</p>
<p>The Eagles are the betting favorite to win the NFC Championship again this season. Last year’s Super Bowl runner up is +650 odds to win the big game this season. The Eagles are the victim of their own success and will have to replicate last season’s run without two top assistant coaches. Former defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon is now the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, and former offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the new head coach of the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers advanced to the NFC Championship with a third-string quarterback, and an unfortunate injury to Brock Purdy might’ve cost them a trip to Super Bowl LVII. The 49ers are among the top five betting favorites to win Super Bowl LVIII, and they’re the second team from the NFC at the top of the futures board.</p>
<p>Owner Jerry Jones fired offensive coordinator Kellen Moore when the Cowboys scored just 12 points in their postseason elimination game against the 49ers. Head coach Mike McCarthy will be calling the plays this season, and Brian Schottenheimer takes over at offensive coordinator. The Cowboys are +1400 odds to win the Super Bowl, and they’re the third favorite from the NFC among the top six teams.</p>
<p>Long Shots and Valuetown: Lions, Bolts, Jags, Fins</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions are +2200 odds to win the Super Bowl, and they’re the betting favorite to win the NFC North. It’s been over 30 years since the Lions last won a playoff game, so they’ll have to embark on a historic run to make it happen.</p>
<p>Quarterback Justin Herbert was banged up last season, and he still led the Los Angeles Chargers to a postseason berth despite a serious rib injury. The Bolts are +2500 odds to win the Super Bowl this year.</p>
<p>If quarterback Tua Tagovailoa can remain healthy, then the Miami Dolphins can make a deep run in the playoffs. They’re only +2500 odds to win the Super Bowl, mostly because bettors lack faith that Tagovailoa will avoid a concussion or another serious injury.</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are a popular pick to win the Super Bowl at +3000 odds. They won a playoff game last season, and they’re the betting favorite to win the AFC South this season.</p>
<p>Quick Look at 2022 Preseason Favorites</p>
<p>Before the 2022 NFL season began, the Bills were DraftKings’ betting favorite at +550 odds to win Super Bowl LVII. The other 2022 preseason favorites at DraftKings included the Tampa Bay Bucs (+700), Chiefs (+1000), Green Bay Packers (+1000), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1200) were the latter’s odds to repeat as Super Bowl champions.</p>
<p>Out of the top five preseason favorites last year, the Rams and Packers failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Bucs were eliminated in the first round. The Bills met their fate in the AFC Divisional Round, but the Chiefs got hot and won Super Bowl LVII.</p>
<p>The Eagles were +2200 odds to win Super Bowl LVII, and they were the tenth-highest team on the futures board.</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks were near the bottom of the board at +15000 odds to win the Super Bowl, and they advanced to the postseason. The New York Giants and Jacksonville Jaguars were both dismissed in last year’s preseason. They were both +13000 odds to win the Super Bowl, and ranked in the bottom nine teams. But both teams won a playoff game last year.</p>
