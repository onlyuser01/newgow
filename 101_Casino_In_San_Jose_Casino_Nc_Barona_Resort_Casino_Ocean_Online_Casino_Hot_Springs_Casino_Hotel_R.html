    <h1>101 Casino In San Jose Casino Nc Barona Resort Casino Ocean Online Casino Hot Springs Casino Hotel R</h1>

<p>Poker fans in Illinois are in for a treat, considering that the Rivers Casino Des Plaines confirmed it will open a new poker room later this month.</p>
<p>A New Poker Room Will Open Its Doors This Month in Illinois</p>
<p>The premier poker room at Rivers Casino Des Plaines location will open for visitors this month. The new poker room is the result of a big 78,000 square foot expansion at the venue. The room that was built especially for poker players will be 5,600 square feet.</p>
<p>This will be the fourth poker room to open doors in Illinois. Besides Des Plaines, poker fans can also get into some poker action at Bally’s Quad Cities Casino and Hotel, Hollywood Casino Aurora and Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino’s new poker room will feature 22 poker tables. It is yet to be confirmed what poker games will be played. However, the venue vowed to disclose additional details about upcoming tournaments and promotions soon. In addition to poker, Rives Casino visitors can also enjoy a plethora of table games and slots. The property offers plenty of dining and entertainment options as well.</p>
<p>Recently, Rush Street Announced Leadership Changes</p>
<p>The ownership of Rivers Casino is split between Churchill Downs Incorporated and Rush Street Gaming (RSG). Last month, Rush Street unveiled that its current CEO, Greg Chaplin, will be leaving the company. The leadership change is effective from May 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Consequently, the company said that Chaplin’s position will be filled by Tim Drehkoff, who currently serves as CFO of the company. Drehkoff has been a part of Rush Street for nearly 20 years. Since 2012, he has held the position of CFO, but as of May, he will step up as the company’s new CEO.</p>
<p>“With this proposed expansion, we will be able to offer our guests more of the entertainment and dining options they enjoy, additional gaming opportunities and a long-desired poker room.” Greg Carlin, CEO at Rush Street Gaming</p>
<p>It was back in February last year when Rush Street first unveiled details regarding the planned expansion for Rivers Casino Des Plaines. Back then, the company reaffirmed its commitment to add a new poker room and expand its property by adding a new restaurant and expanded gaming floor.</p>
<p>Back then, Carlin outlined that the expansion will bring new experiences for the venue’s guests. He acknowledged that offering first-class experiences for the guests has been a key goal for the company.</p>
