    <h1>Casinos Shreveport La Golden Pony Casino Usa Casinos Casino Indio Yellow Brick Casino Hot Bet Casino</h1>

<p>Dear ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>I deposited at hot.bet 7 times each 100 EUR.</p>
<p>Every deposit was under another name on my statment of account</p>
<p>and there was not mentioned that is was for casino but for hotelbooking, flighbooking, purchase of goods etc.</p>
<p>The names were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ninte DEV ltd Festac NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memphis IT Support ltd Ikeja NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keypointstores ltd Surulere NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>igservice Lagos NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azeem Ani. Aba NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Konsultant Weezy Wuse NG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zanibal LLC Abuja NG</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The name Hot.Bet or Bellona N.V. did not appear on any deposit but for that 7 different companies in reference to Nigeria!!! Why Nigeria? Hot.bet says that they are licenced in Curacao.</p>
<p>There is a White List in Germany ( See attached File) which lists every single Casino which is legal to offer Casino Games in Germany. Hot.bet ist not on the list. So they are not allowed to offer Casinogames to german customers although they say that they are allowed to so. I am sure that Hot.bet wants to disguise their scheming by using different names and indicates purpose of use which is fraud</p>
<p>Although my account at hot.bet was in EUR, hot.bet used USD and they calculated with a good currancy rate for them so that each deposit of actually 100 EUR was about 107 EUR + 1,75% VISA got for the currency conversion. This was not agreed.</p>
<p>I asked Hot.bet several times during the last 8 month to explain why they debited to much and why under several names. They only told me all the time that the request is in progress and they get back to me soon. Since 8 month!!!</p>
<p>I doubt that Hot.bet is a legal company and request the refund. Not to mention that ebery single deposit got lost. not a single win and I found out that hot.bet is not allowed to offer casion games to customers in germany although they told it in the chat. I have the chat history.</p>
<p>I hope for your help and thank you in advance</p>
<p>Manuel Z<strong>*</strong></p>
