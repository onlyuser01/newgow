<p>Wazdan has continued to gather momentum in the highly competitive and coveted iGaming market in New Jersey, United States with the acclaimed supplier now launching with Tipico, another local prominent brand that is determined to claw a share of the iGaming market in the country and provide the best possible content to all, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>The partnership is facilitated through the Light &amp; Wonder’s iGaming ecosystem which makes it much easier for Tipico Casino to garner access to a range of Wazdan’s absolutely delightful titles, among which are such excellent choices as Hot Slot: Mystery Jackpot Joker, Magic Spins, Sun of Fortune, 9 Coins and others.</p>
<p>Tipico Casino will also benefit from Power of Gods: Hades, adding more authenticity to the experience, and of course, the games that players will have access to will feature many of Wazdan’s proprietary and bespoke game mechanics, such as Cash Infinity, Collect to Infinity, Volatility Levels, Hold the Jackpot, and more.</p>
<p>Wazdan Chief Commercial Officer Andrzej Hyla was excited about having this new opportunity to deploy the Wazdan product in the Garden State, hailing Tipico as a significant partner. "Our partnership with Light &amp; Wonder has been a vital part of our growth in North America, and we’re confident that this will be another boost to all parties," Hyla added.</p>
<p>Tipico Casino was similarly pleased, and the company shared that it was excited to have the opportunity to strengthen its local game library with an established provider of titles such as Wazdan. Tipico hailed Wazdan’s "bold themes" and "engaging genres" that have now populated its own portfolio, making it a preferred choice amongst local gamers.</p>
<p>Wazdan just recently struck a similar deal with another gaming operator in the United Kingdom, teaming up with Midnite to ensure that the brand has access to more diverse and worthwhile titles. In Europe, the company has indeed been growing at a rapid pace, including with rollouts in Italy through Lottomatica, NetBet, and others.</p>
<p>Other launches in the UK included a rollout of content with 32Red. In North America, Wazdan launched with Caesars in Ontario, Canada.</p>
