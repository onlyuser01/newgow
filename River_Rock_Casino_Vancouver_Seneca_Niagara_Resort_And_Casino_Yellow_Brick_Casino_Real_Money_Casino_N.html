<p>Online sports betting and gaming brand Betway has strengthened its position as sponsor for major tennis events by inking a sponsorship agreement with the European Open.</p>
<p>Tennis and Betway Go Hand in Hand</p>
<p>Malta-based online gaming brand Betway announced today it agreed to become a sponsor of the ATP TOUR European Open tennis event that is scheduled to take place from October 19 to October 25 in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce a partnership deal with The European Open, Belgium’s only ATP Tour Event. The tournament is still in its infancy but has already had some major names on its roll of honour. We’re looking forward to supporting the competition as it grows into a leading event on the ATP Tour.” Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>Also commenting on the new sponsorship deal, Juan de Dios Aguirre, partner at the European Open operator Tennium, outlined the efforts and dedication of the team running the tennis tournament since its inception in 2016, looking to “give fans a top experience” while at the same time “increase the value” of the tournament advertising assets. “We are proud of this agreement that comes with a leading company in the sector, with scrupulous compliance of industry regulations,” he asserts.</p>
<p>The agreement to sponsor the 6-day tennis event will present Betway with further opportunities to gain brand recognition and industry exposure in a tournament that previously featured as winners Andy Murray, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Kyle Edmund. The sponsorship also builds on the operator’s previous industry sponsorship deals with other prestigious tennis tournaments.</p>
<p>Brand Exposure at Prestigious Tennis Events</p>
<p>In March, Betway agreed to become a sponsor of the Miami Open, running from March 22 to April 4, and gain brand exposure digitally and courtside at the host venue, the Hard Rock Stadium. The agreement expanded on the operator’s previous tennis involvement with tournaments like the Tie Break Tens and Davis Cup. In April, Betway teamed with the Madrid Open to become its sponsor.</p>
<p>June was also busy for Betway after sponsorship deals with two tournaments in Germany, the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, from June 8 to June 13, and the Noventi Open in Hamburg, from June 12 to June 20. The brand also announced sponsorship agreements with two clay-court tennis events taking place in July, the Nordea Open in Sweden and the Hamburg Open in Germany. Betway sponsored one more tournament in July, the Generali Open in the town of Kitzbühel in the Austrian Alps.</p>
