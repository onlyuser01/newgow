<p>Resorts World Las Vegas will continue with construction efforts as planned and will open in the summer of 2021, after pushing the original launch by a year from 2020.</p>
<p>Genting’s Resorts World Remains Optimistic about the Future</p>
<p>With Resorts World Las Vegas calling it lights out until next summer, the property is already preparing for its future opening. Genting Berhad, the corporation behind the casino resort located on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, will forge ahead with construction efforts as it prepares for a proper launch in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty ushered in by the novel coronavirus, Genting Berhad released a series of announcements regarding the future of the property and operations on the Las Vegas Strip. Genting Group president Scott Sibella explained that the brand has strategically waited for the wave of negativity to die down at least a little for Genting to step up and deliver some good news and a positive outlook.</p>
<p>Resorts World’s opening pushed back to 2021.</p>
<p>Sibella confirmed that the company is pushing ahead with its plans to build the underground transportation system, and specifically a tunnel and a passenger station that will connect Resorts World with the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
<p>The system is part of Elon Musk’s latest project designed to build lightning-fast underground transportation system that features roads and trains under Las Vegas. The Boring Company is going to include Wynn Resorts as one of the connected venues at first, but the network should encompass many more properties in Nevada.</p>
<p>A Spate of Partnerships and Projects in Progress</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas submitted plans in June looking for permission to begin developing the project, joining Wynn. While lights may be formally off, Resorts World introduced a 100,000-square-foot LED screen on the West Tower, on the Strip side, running a light show and displaying the brand’s logo.</p>
<p>On July 16, Resorts World tied up another partnership, that time with AEG Presents to develop the Theatre at Resorts World, which has a preliminary capacity of 5,000 seats. The theatre will host all sorts of entertaining performances, including concerns. Commenting for the Las Vegas Sun, Sibella had this to say:</p>
<p>“If you look at what’s happening in our town with the convention center expansion, the Raiders’ stadium of course and then what we’re doing, I think this is the best thing for this city to get through this. You these three big things coming up out of the ground and how big they are for and they’re really going to help us get back faster to where we want to be.” Genting Group president Scott Sibella</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Concerts West President co-CEO John Meglen has described the upcoming project as the latest and most modernized venue, offering a versatile, creative and innovative experience in the live entertainment segment.</p>
<p>While the novel coronavirus outbreak has affected the brand’s bottom line negatively, Sibella confirmed that the casino would continue to prioritize the health and safety of individuals.</p>
<p>Resorts World will continue to add square footage to its complex, introducing a 75,000 sq ft nightlife and daylife concept, and more. Sibella confirmed that the company was excited about the upcoming changes and the opportunity to develop the property.</p>
