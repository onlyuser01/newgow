<p>BetMGM is preparing for one of the most significant poker gatherings, the 2024 Borgata Winter Poker Open, and part of this preparation expects the company to appoint an official media partner. This has now been settled with PokerOrg stepping in as the official media partner, who is an industry publication focusing on poker, its growth and popularity.</p>
<p>The 2024 Borgata Winter Poker Open will feature a massive $10,000,000 with the series running 22 main events. The event will also have an official online qualifier, which could very well be the biggest in the history of Borgata Poker.</p>
<p>As a media partner, PokerOrg will be tasked with helping keep track of the event and make sure that people are in the loop about what is happening at the green felt. PokerOrg CEO EricHollreiser welcomed the news and thanked BetMGM for the opportunity to see the publication be appointed as an official partner.</p>
<p>"Players and fans will be able to follow along as PokerOrg’s independent, player-focused, social-media style of reporting brings all the characters, hands, bad beats, and hero calls to life via our Instant Live feed and our social channels," Hollreiser noted.</p>
<p>The opportunity was similarly welcomed by BetMGM Director of Poker Luke Staudenmaier who said that it was great to see the two organizations come together to amplify poker players’ stories and raise awareness for the game.</p>
<p>"This is just the start of a thrilling year of omnichannel poker events ahead," Staudenmaier said, suggesting that there are more good things lying ahead indeed. The event is an exciting first stop for BetMGM as the tournament will get underway on January 2 and run through January 26, 2024.</p>
<p>In fact, BetMGM Poker will run Online Qualifiers through January 20, 2024, which may see you enter the event at any point if you prove your skill at the digital green felt first. Players may opt to simply pay the buy-ins and turn up in person to play without any qualifiers, though. The 2024 Borgata Winter Poker Open is expected to be the largest event in the series.</p>
