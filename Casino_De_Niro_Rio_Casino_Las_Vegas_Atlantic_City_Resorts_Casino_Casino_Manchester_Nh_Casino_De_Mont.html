    <h1>Casino De Niro Rio Casino Las Vegas Atlantic City Resorts Casino Casino Manchester Nh Casino De Mont</h1>

<p>Thank you for the email and evidence, Fezbet Casino.</p>
<p>Dear eissnerbenjamin1986,</p>
<p>After a careful review of the evidence provided by the casino, I am afraid I am no longer able to pursue this case. There is sufficient evidence of multiple accounts created by you within the company's casino network where in some accounts you have just amended some information in an attempt to trick the system that's why you have failed the KYC process.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the casinos T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>4.1 By opening an account on our Website and by using our Website you warrant that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all data and information that you have provided when registering at our Website is true and real and you will continue updating this information in case of any changes;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.1 The Website may only be used for personal entertainment purposes only. The following activities are strictly prohibited and will be considered a material breach of these General Terms and Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>using any form of cheating or other means of gaining an unfair advantage or influence, including, without limitation, making use of a software error, loophole or bug, using software or hardware to automate, distort or influence the outcome of bets;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.4 Should we arrive at a reasonable suspicion that you have engaged in a fraud, any illegal or improper activity, or have otherwise breached the Terms, we reserve the right to take any number of the following action, at our sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>void any winnings obtained, cancel any pending withdrawals and refund the last deposit made into the account</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these circumstances, I will not be able to help you with this and this complaint will now be rejected. Casinos have a very strict policy regarding multiple account cases that have been used in this way.</p>
<p>I can only advise you to create only one account and use only your own valid personal details.</p>
<p>I wish I could have been of more help. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
