<p>The SBC Charity Boxing Championship will return after a long delay due to Covid-19. The event is hosted in partnership with Oliver’s Wish Foundation, and it will have a number of prominent industry executives enter the ring as fighters in order to raise funds on November 11, 2022.</p>
<p>The event will be held at the Grand Ballroom at the Hilton on Park Lane, London, and will reunite more than 500 guests. SBC has invited James Haskell, a prominent British Lions rugby star and TV personality and Sky F1 host Natalie Pinkham to help with the event.</p>
<p>The boxing event is bringing together iGaming executives who will fight it out across six evenly matched three-round bouts, SBC informed in a press release. The event participants include:</p>
<p>Leon Thomas (Managing Director and Group Strategy, Entain) v Nick Wright (SVP Business Development, Interactive at Bally's Corporation)</p>
<p>Mark Woollard (Managing Director, Banijay Brands) v Rokas Daugirdas (Compliance Manager, BetGames)</p>
<p>Boris Chaikin (iGaming Executive) v Luke Cousins (Director, Koneksi Partners)</p>
<p>Michael Brady (CEO, Eyas Gaming) v Tony Plaskow (Commercial Director, Black Cow Technology)</p>
<p>Brandon Walker (Business Development Director, Amelco) v Jan Urbanec (CEO, Endorphina)</p>
<p>Daniel Beard (Partner, Partis Solutions) v Vasilije Lekovic (VP Gaming, Trustly)</p>
<p>The Oliver’s Wish Foundation raises funds in support of children and young people. The SBC Charity Boxing Championship will help with these efforts. Daniel Beard, who is one of the people behind the Championship said that the event is an opportunity to help those in need that the Foundation seeks to assist.</p>
<p>Beard acknowledged that the Championship would have been hosted much earlier, in April 2020, but Covid-19 lockdowns had made that impossible, postponing the bouts by two years. Now, though, the industry is back to help raise funds for the foundation and this is what matters, Beard assured.</p>
<p>SBC Founder and CEO Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the event and opportunity and added that it is planned to be a memorable get-together that will assist Oliver’s Wish Foundation. Sojmark said that the Foundation is doing an admirable job in raising awareness and money for charities and that SBC is honored to be able to work alongside the Foundation.</p>
<p>Dozens of companies already support the SBC Charity Boxing Championship, including Push Gaming, Square in the Air, Trustly, White Hat Gaming, Yggdrasil, Microgaming, BetGames, Endorphina, Entain, and Amelco among others.</p>
