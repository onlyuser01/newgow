<p>In addition to the transition to new group CFO, the company confirmed the departure of its group chief people officer, Melissa Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>The globally-recognizable betting operator, PointsBet, announced its plans to transition to a new group chief financial officer (CFO). This week, the company confirmed that its current group CFO, Andrew Mellor, will be replaced next year. To succeed the outgoing group CFO, PointsBet selected Alister Lui, who currently holds the role of chief financial officer (Australia) and head of group finance.</p>
<p>PointsBet confirmed that Mellor is expected to exit the company effective from February 29, 2024. The transition to the new group CFO is expected to happen after the company publishes its half year results. Once Mellor departs from PointsBet, Lui is expected to fill in the role effective from March 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Until the senior-level change is completed, Lui and Mellor will collaborate for the swift transition of responsibilities. An ongoing focus of the current group CFO will also be the sale of the company’s US assets to Fanatics Betting and Gaming. PointsBet’s sale of its US assets to Fanatics dates to earlier this year when the company agreed to divest those assets in a $225 million deal that is expected to be completed soon.</p>
<p>Besides the planned transition to a new group CFO, the company confirmed its current group chief people officer, Melissa Fitzpatrick, intends to leave the company. Considering the sale of PointsBet’s US assets, her position was deemed in excess and those responsibilities would be transferred to the company’s Canadian and Australian HR operations.</p>
<p>The Company’s Chairman Thanks the Outgoing Group CFO</p>
<p>The announced planned departure for Mellor comes after he held the role for five years. His successor, Lui brings extensive experience after holding senior-level roles in finance and banking for nearly two decades. Initially, Lui joined the company six years ago and has held important senior-level roles since.</p>
<p>“Andrew has made a transformational contribution to PointsBet over his tenure. He has built a world class finance function that has grown from a small number of employees based in Australia to a high performing team operating across multiple regions.“ Brett Paton, chairman at PointsBet</p>
<p>Brett Paton, PointsBet’s chairman, spoke about Mellor’s achievements with the company, outlining that he played an important role during a transformational period for the business. Paton said that under the guidance of Mellor, PointsBet grew in different regions, building a strong team in the process. “He has been an integral part of the global executive leadership team, driving our strong growth and expansion into new regions, while ensuring we had the right capital structure to execute the global strategy,” said Paton about the outgoing group CFO.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company’s chairman was excited with Fitzpatrick’s accomplishments and the important role she played as group chief people officer. He explained that Fitzpatrick’s expertise helped the company overcome COVID-related challenges while strengthening its sustainability initiatives.</p>
