<p>PointsBet Buying Banach Technology for $43 Million to Expand In-Game Betting Platform</p>

<p>PointsBet (OTC:PBTHF) is acquiring Banach Technology for $43 million. The move is aimed at increasing the sportsbook operator’s footprint in the fast-growing in-game betting market.</p>

<p>PointsBet will pay 55 percent of the $43 million in cash and deliver 1.75 million shares to privately held Banach. The Australian company is also paying $4 million to the target to convert existing equity options, which will be retained by the buyer. The transaction is slated to close in April.</p>
<p>The acquisition will position PointsBet as a leader of in-play sports wagering in the US, just as in-play wagering is expected to grow exponentially,” said the Australian company in a statement.</p>
<p>PointsBet is operational in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and New Jersey. Its US headquarters is in Denver.</p>
<p>Ireland-based Banach develops risk management and trading platforms. They support traditional and in-game betting products for the four major US sports leagues and international soccer leagues.</p>
<p>PointsBet Wagering on Live Betting Boom</p>
<p>Currently, about half of all sports bets are placed live or in-game. PointsBet sees that percentage accelerating to 75 percent over the next three years.</p>
<p>That style of wagering is popular in markets outside the US, namely Europe, where slower-paced sports are popular with bettors. In the US, sports such as basketball, hockey and, to a lesser extent, football, aren’t conducive to in-game betting. However, baseball and golf, among others, are suited for it.</p>
<p>PointsBet rivals such as DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) previously highlighted opportunities for more in-game action in the US. PointsBet is the official betting partner of the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>“As legislation to approve sports betting accelerates across the US, it has become clear that the in-play opportunity will be very significant, and those with the best depth and breadth of product will win,” said PointsBet CEO Sam Swanell in the statement.</p>
<p>With the Banach purchase, PointsBet gets an experienced team of in-game developers because the Irish company’s founders previously ran the quantitative division at Flutter Entertainment (OTC:PDYPY).</p>
<p>Potentially Potent Purchase for PointsBet</p>
<p>Last year, PointsBet inked a $500 million deal with Comcast’s NBC Sports to become the broadcaster’s official sports betting partner. This confirmed its intent to become a major player in the US sports wagering scene.</p>
<p>As sports wagering becomes more mainstream, gaming and media companies are joining forces. That could provide a long-ranging avenue for increasing adoption of live betting, making PointsBet’s Banach buy look prescient.</p>
<p>“PointsBet offers the most markets on all four major U.S. sports (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL),” according to the company.</p>
