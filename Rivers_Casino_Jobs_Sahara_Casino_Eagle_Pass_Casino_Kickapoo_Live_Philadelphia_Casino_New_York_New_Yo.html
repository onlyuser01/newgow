<p>On Developing Wild Buffalo Bonanza Slot</p>
<p>NetGaming has focused on creating a game that stands out by virtue of its simplistic and familiar gameplay while paying attention to the art instead. The art in Wild Buffalo Bonanza is deeply realistic, courtesy of an intricate design process that was facilitated by AI with the help of designers.</p>
<p>“It involved more than just utilizing prompts,” the company said in a press release. The designers were actively involved in the designing process and the final results, experimenting with a variety of styles, paintings, illustrations, and 3D render engines, as well as cinematic approaches.</p>
<p>The upshot is a deeply immersive in-game environment that was built by training the AI to understand NetGaming’s preferred styles. This development practice has allowed significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of the AI-generated outputs throughout, meaning that NetGaming now has a powerful pattern it could follow to produce future releases.</p>
<p>Innovation has been a byword for the studio, having developed innovative titles such as Dragon Fortress – Battle of the Castle and APED, an NFT-inspired slot game. Once the company was able to figure out the ideal style for Wild Buffalo Bonanza, the designers integrated the necessary prompts to maintain a consistent look.</p>
<p>Some of the prompts were highly specific, leading to the consistent results NetGaming was aiming for at the beginning, including “Cherokee woman with war bonnet, isolated, front, face, oil painting.” Other prompts were somewhat more simplistic, such as “letter A, golden frame, 3D vector, jewels.” The entire process was based on trial and error with multiple refinements to the inputs required to finally produce what is a captivating end-game product.</p>
<p>“In the end, the entire process combined human ingenuity with a range of AI tools and techniques, allowing us to craft a game we are truly proud of,” NetGaming concluded.</p>
<p>The game was released on White Hat Gaming, exclusively, on April 13, 2023, before the general release scheduled on April 27, 2023.</p>
