<p>Pragmatic Play and Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino have strengthened their existing relationship that covers slot content, expanding the alliance to now feature Live Casino options and elevate the experience for local players in Belgium.</p>
<p>The partnership is doubly special as it comes with custom-branded tables that will be featured as part of Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino’s existing offer and are marked by the studio’s unique insight into developing and building robust titles.</p>
<p>The operator has welcomed the opportunity to further expand its clout in iGaming by adding unique and classic live tables with games such as Pragmatic Play’s Blackjack and Roulette options, as well as some of its outside-the-box products such as Sweet Bonanza Candyland.</p>
<p>Of course, Pragmatic Play will hardly stop there and feature Roulette and Blackjack tables along the way. The player experience will be further enhanced by hosting Flemish-speaking live dealers who will guide players through the action for that level of extra immersion and cutting-edge gameplay that players have come to expect from the Napoleon brand.</p>
<p>Head of Casino at Napoleon, Nicolas Van Malderghem was cheerful at the opportunity to see his company enhance its propositionin the market, and further consolidate its partnership with Pragmatic Play in the market.</p>
<p>"Adding the provider’s Live Casino vertical to our catalogue of games will help us acquire more players looking for revolutionary Live Casino gameplay and more traditional card games," Van Malderghem said.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides was of a similar mind and said that the studio was very excited to be introducing its range of experiences with Napoleon Sport &amp; Casino once again. Pragmatic Play has recently significantly expanded its footprint in various markets, bringing tailored solutions to each of its existing and new partners.</p>
<p>The company enhanced its partnership with Bally’s in a similar fashion and added Live Casino to the existing slot arrangement. Furthermore, Pragmatic Play teamed up with Betsson Group’s Betsafe brand to introduce a dedicated Spanish-language roulette, part of the studio’s commitment to building gaming portfolios that are tailored to each partner specifically.</p>
<p>Not least, the supplier recently made another European foray with GAMRFIRST in Switzerland, where it brought 50 hand-picked games to the local market, and further strengthened its foothold in the market.</p>
