    <h1>Players Club Casino Island Casino Casino In Catskills Soundtrack From Casino Indian Casinos In South</h1>

<p>PlayStar Casino signed a multi-year partnership deal with casino giant Caesars Entertainment to gain market access in Pennsylvania ahead of its upcoming debut in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Double Addressable Market</p>
<p>The agreement between PlayStar Casino and Caesars will allow the iGaming brand to double its addressable market by way of population and gross gaming revenue when its planned launch in the Keystone State takes place in the second quarter of 2022, subject to gaining regulatory approval.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have secured market access in Pennsylvania through this multi-year deal with Caesars, allowing us to double our addressable market.” Adam Noble, Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer, PlayStar Casino</p>
<p>The announcement of the deal came just days after PlayStar Casino announced it signed a long-term agreement with its technology supplier Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to cover Pennsylvania and ensure its product offering in the state.</p>
<p>In February, PlayStar Casino signed an agreement with GiG to confirm the gaming technology supplier as its partner ahead of a planned launch in New Jersey for the fourth quarter of 2021. As part of the deal, both partners agreed to expand the partnership coverage for new market additions set to come at a later stage.</p>
<p>“This is the second market access deal we have secured after announcing our entry into New Jersey earlier in the year and will continue to seek such partnerships as we expand the PlayStar Casino brand.” Adam Noble, Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer, PlayStar Casino</p>
<p>New Jersey Spill-Over Effect</p>
<p>The addition of Pennsylvania as its second US jurisdiction is set to allow PlayStar Casino to utilize spill-over effects from its marketing and brand awareness activities in New Jersey, to further boost its local campaigns.</p>
<p>With a strategy built around personalization and exemplary customer service to make players feel special and running the show, PlayStar Casino is looking to differentiate itself from the other iGaming brands and take its unique niche in the US online gaming space.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to working through the regulatory process with the Pennsylvanian Gaming Control Board (PGCB) and all going well look forward to launching to players in Pennsylvania in the first half of next year.” Adam Noble, Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer, PlayStar Casino</p>
<p>By ensuring market entry into the nation’s second-largest online gaming jurisdiction in terms of revenue, PlayStar Casino is looking to benefit from the vast potential of the market in the Keystone State which industry analysts believe is still far from reaching its full potential.</p>
