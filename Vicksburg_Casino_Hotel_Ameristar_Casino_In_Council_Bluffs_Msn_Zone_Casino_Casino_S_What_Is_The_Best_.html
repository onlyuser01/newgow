    <h1>Vicksburg Casino Hotel Ameristar Casino In Council Bluffs Msn Zone Casino Casino S What Is The Best</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had, or rather have, an account with N1 Casino. According to their Terms and Conditions, there is even a special paragraph for German players. However, the provisions of the German or EU gambling law are not being complied with. I was able to deposit 2,500€ within 4 days, even though only 1,000€ should have been possible. I was also able to play with stakes higher than 1€, and the casino does not have a German license which means German players should be excluded.</p>
<p>As a result, I requested a refund of at least 1,500€, which is the amount I deposited and gambled that was above the legal limit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they only referred to their Terms and Conditions. And once again, as a consumer, I believe in good faith that if there is even a separate paragraph for German players this offer must be legal.</p>
<p>Best regards, Rabea</p>
