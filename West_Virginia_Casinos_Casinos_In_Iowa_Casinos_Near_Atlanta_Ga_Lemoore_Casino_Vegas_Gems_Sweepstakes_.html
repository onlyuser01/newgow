    <h1>West Virginia Casinos Casinos In Iowa Casinos Near Atlanta Ga Lemoore Casino Vegas Gems Sweepstakes</h1>

<p>The largest independently-owned daily fantasy sports platform in North America, PrizePicks, has inked a content sponsorship deal with Tour Junkies – a podcast and blog series, specializing in PGA Tour betting and fantasy content.</p>
<p>PrizePicks Gets Its Own Segment</p>
<p>The agreement will see PrizePicks’ branding featured across all of Tour Junkies’ content. Additionally, the weekly Tour Junkies show will feature a segment that is entirely dedicated to PrizePicks. The segment will be integrated into the Tour Junkies’ usual podcast and will include various insights, commentaries, breakdowns, and analyses of the latest developments in fantasy golf. The segment will be hosted by the podcasts’ usual hosts, Pat Perry and David Barnett.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tour Junkies and PrizePicks will work together on a contest called “Road to Augusta.” The latter will provide PrizePicks’ daily fantasy sports players with the opportunity to meet with the Tour Junkies in person, in April at the Augusta Tournament Week 2022.</p>
<p>The Parties Are Thrilled to Work Together</p>
<p>Jordan Gold, the partnerships manager of PrizePicks, spoke on the new deal. He said that the golf market is still young and has a lot of potential for growth. PrizePicks aims to seize new opportunities, appeal to golf fans, and become the to-go place for single-player fantasy golf contests.</p>
<p>“Our sponsorship agreement with the Tour Junkies, one of the premier sources for fantasy golf analysis, will be instrumental in expanding our golf audience as we elevate our PGA product offering to new heights in 2022 and beyond.” PrizePicks partnerships manager Jordan Gold</p>
<p>One of the Tour Junkies’ hosts, David Barnett, said that the podcast team is thrilled to be backed by PrizePicks. Barnett added that the daily fantasy company is a leader in single-player fantasy for a reason – it is renowned for its commitment to golf fans and has a critically-acclaimed suite of golf content and PGA contests.</p>
<p>Barnett is sure that the Tour Junkies’ viewers will be delighted to discover PrizePicks’ content and their appealing PGA SPF content offerings. He added that he expects fans to be ecstatic by the opportunity to win the Road to Augusta prize. Golf fans can watch the Tour Junkies’ golf podcast every Monday on the Tour Junkies’ official YouTube Channel.</p>
<p>PrizePicks is steadily expanding its business, affirming itself as an undisputed leader in single-player fantasy. In December, the company closed its latest funding round, which saw investments from both new and old investors pour in. In April 2021, PrizePicks diversified its offerings by including more golf games, cricket, and disc golf.</p>
