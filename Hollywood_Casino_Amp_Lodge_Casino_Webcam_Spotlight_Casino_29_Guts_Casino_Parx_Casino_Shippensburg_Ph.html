    <h1>Hollywood Casino Amp Lodge Casino Webcam Spotlight Casino 29 Guts Casino Parx Casino Shippensburg Ph</h1>

<p>We shouldn't have to fight to get our winnings PERIOD!! Especially when we go above and beyond to play by their ridiculous terms and conditions. It seems like those of us that do....will end up being declined over a made up rule or a situation that is blatantly false like the one they denied me for (see above original post). After several attempts to prove them wrong they simply stopped replying to my messages and even ignored Casino Guru's requests as they did try to assist me after I submitted a formal complaint, which I am very grateful for. If this doesn't scream GUILT in itself then I don't know what else does. Unfortunately online gambling isn't regulated by any government entities so holding them responsible or trying to sue them gets you absolutely nowhere but broke. It's a sad situation so the only thing we can do as players is to complain on every available review platform to warn others in the hopes that these crooks go broke because nobody frequents their sites. Hopefully something gets put into place in the near future that will regulate these assholes and shut them down when they violate its' players rights. I wish you all the best of luck and PLEASE PLEASE take the time to research these gambling sites and take every complaint seriously when you do vet them. The odds are stacked against us enough in this viscous world...we HAVE to to our homework thoroughly to protect ourselves.</p>
