<p>Camelot UK Lotteries Ltd announced today it had achieved a third successive year of growth, posting a record £7.91 billion in total ticket sales for 2019-20 fiscal year, driven mainly by sales in its digital vertical that jumped above the £2 billion mark for the first time.</p>
<p>Millions for Good Causes</p>
<p>Most importantly, the lottery operator managed to generate during these crucial times nearly £200 million more to Good Causes, to push its contribution towards UK charities and organisations that tackle the impact of the virus to £600 million.</p>
<p>“Three years on from our strategic review, we are seeing growth across all areas of the business. Crucially, our best-ever sales performance has delivered a £200 million boost to Good Causes at a time when the UK needs it most.” Nigel Railton, CEO, Camelot</p>
<p>Digital Sales</p>
<p>Camelot experienced growth across all verticals, with the most significant one being in its digital products. A record online sales number of £2.46 billion over the period, an increase of £624 million, saw the lottery exceed the £2 billion sales mark for the first time. Mobile sales posted an increase of £586 million to reach an all-time high of £1.61 billion, with total share of sales through smartphones and tablets now accounting for around 65% of all digital sales.</p>
<p>Draw-Based Games</p>
<p>Total sales of draw-based games posted an increase of £455 million to reach £4.54 billion, mainly driven by improvements Camelot implemented to create a more compelling and distinct range of games. Bigger, fixed cash prizes and regular ‘Must Be Won’ draws were among the contributors Camelot outlined that helped it be one of the few lottery operators globally to grow its lotto game.</p>
<p>EuroMillions, which had an exceptional year, as well as the newest game, Set for Life, which has given its £10,000 a month for 30 years top prize to 16 winners already, also played their part in growing the popularity of Camelot and exceed sales expectations.</p>
<p>Sales of National Lottery Scratchcards and online Instant Win Games over the period were £3.37 billion, up by £243 million, after substantial efforts put by the lottery company to give players a wider range of differently-priced products with varying themes.</p>
<p>Retail Channel</p>
<p>The retail business of Camelot accounted for nearly 70% of all ticket sales, and despite the challenges in the environment, posted a growth of in-store sales by £74.3 million, to £5.45 billion, remaining the largest sales channel for the lottery operator. The growth in retail sales underlined the effective work undertaken by Camelot in support of its retail partners.</p>
<p>Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>The growth for the fiscal 2019-20 year was achieved by Camelot alongside its commitment to ensure a safer gaming and player protection, as the company invested heavily during the course of the year in its healthy play tools. Camelot was the first lottery operator to achieve for its online and retail operations Advanced Level 2 of GamCare’s Safer Gambling Standard.</p>
<p>Camelot has been running the UK National Lottery, the sixth largest in the world sales-wise, since its first days in 1994, but its current contract expires in February 2021, with some controversies already surrounding the application process for its successor.</p>
