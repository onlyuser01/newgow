<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Big Bass Hold and Spinner Megaways uses the Megaways system, randomizing the number and size of symbols in each reel.</p>
<p>Reels 1 and 6 can have as many as 6 symbols. Above reels 2-5, there are 3 additional rows of symbols with the topmost row containing only Wild symbols and blanks. The 3 top rows spin independently from left to right, and are locked and unlocked at random.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel. In total, there are 147,456 ways to win.</p>
<p>The Tumble feature means that winning symbols vanish after paying out. This allows new symbols to fall into the newly available positions. Tumbles continue until no more winning combinations are available.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 20,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Scatter symbol, the Fisherman symbol, and the Coin Money symbol. Wild symbols can only land on the topmost row.</p>
<p>The Fish Money symbol takes on a random value for each spin. These values range from 2x to 5,000x the player’s total bet which can be won during the Free Spins feature. During the base game, Fish Money symbols explode and disappear just as other symbols do. However, during the Free Spins feature, they do not disappear but fall to the bottom of the reels instead.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols appear randomly during the base game and the Free Spins feature. During the base game, Mystery symbols will change into matching paying symbols. In the Free Spins feature, Mystery symbols will transform into other random symbols during spins that contain only Fisherman symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Scatter symbols. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of triggering Scatters as follows:</p>
<p>3 Scatters = 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters = 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters = 20 free spins</p>
<p>6 Scatters = 25 free spins</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, the Fisherman symbol can appear anywhere but the topmost row. Players collect all Fishmeran symbols until the end of the feature and every 4th Fisherman symbol retriggers the feature. A multiplier for the Fish Money symbol collection increases for each retrigger.</p>
<p>Coin Money symbols can land anywhere except the topmost row, taking on values between 1x and 30x. When players land 3 or more Coin Money symbols anywhere on the reels, the Hold &amp; Spin Bonus is triggered.</p>
<p>The triggering Coin Money symbols remain in place as the feature begins, while the other reels fade away. The grid of symbols then becomes the same size as the spin that triggered the feature.</p>
<p>The Hold &amp; Spin feature begins with 3 respins, with new Coin Money symbols resetting this count back to 3. All Coin Money symbol values are collected to be paid out at the conclusion of the round.</p>
<p>The Diamond Money symbol takes on a random value between 50x and 2000x the player’s total bet whenever it lands.</p>
<p>A minimum win of 20x is guaranteed during the Hold &amp; Spin Bonus and the round concludes when no respins remain.</p>
