    <h1>Planet 7 Casino William Hill Casino Silverton Casino Inclave Casino Casino Adrenaline Disorderly Iow</h1>

<p>Upon entering the woman’s hotel room, police officers observed the unmistakable scent of burnt marijuana, along with visible marijuana, a grinder, and a multi-colored smoking device</p>
<p>A 31-year-old East Moline woman, Missy Smith, found herself in custody following an incident at the Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf on Sunday afternoon. Smith faces charges of assault on persons in certain occupations, with additional charges related to possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>Woman’s Aggressive Outburst Leads to Assault on Emergency Personnel</p>
<p>The commotion began when casino security sought law enforcement assistance around 2:45 p.m. due to Smith’s refusal to vacate her hotel room, reported Our Quad Cities. Upon entering the room, officers noted the distinct aroma of burnt marijuana. Allegedly in plain view were marijuana, a grinder, and a multi-colored smoking device.</p>
<p>As the situation unfolded, Smith encountered hotel security in the hallway while Bettendorf Fire Department EMTs attempted to assess her condition. Witnesses claim she erupted into a fit of profanity-laden threats, physically assaulting the emergency medical staff with kicks and aggressive hand movements.</p>
<p>Law enforcement documents state that Smith, after being placed on a medical stretcher for transportation to the hospital, escalated the situation by kicking a paramedic multiple times. Shockingly, she then gathered a significant amount of saliva and forcefully spat it into the eye of a police officer.</p>
<p>To manage her aggressive behavior, officers resorted to using a law enforcement restraining tool called “The Wrap” and fitting Smith with a spit hood. Even with these measures in place, she allegedly continued to forcibly spit on the paramedic while inside the ambulance.</p>
<p>Legal Woes Mount for Smith as She Faces Drug Charges Alongside Assault Allegations</p>
<p>In addition to the assault charges, Smith faces a serious misdemeanor charge for the possession of a controlled substance – marijuana. Smith is currently held at the Scott County Jail, with bail set at $5,300. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 11 in Scott County Court.</p>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed whether Smith suffered from any medical conditions that may have contributed to her erratic behavior, leaving the motive behind her actions unclear. The casino and law enforcement agencies continue to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>In other news, a man identified as L.L.B., 48, has been sentenced to 24 to 60 months in prison for his involvement in a casino bar fight at the former Hard Rock Casino in Stateline, Nevada. The altercation, captured on CCTV, resulted in injuries to an unnamed woman, including a fractured upper jaw and the loss of two teeth. The incident occurred in November 2021, with the sentencing taking place recently, and details about the cause of the dispute and any injuries sustained by the attacker remain undisclosed.</p>
