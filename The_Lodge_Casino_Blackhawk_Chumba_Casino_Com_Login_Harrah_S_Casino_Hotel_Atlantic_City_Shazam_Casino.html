<p>Mammoth Chase review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition is more or less just a reskinned version of the original Mammoth Chase with small Easter-themed touch ups. This is very much on brand for Kalamba who are fond of putting out holiday editions of games that frequently do not go together.</p>
<p>So, here were are 8,000 years before the first Easter, presented with an array of local wildlife including woolly mammoths, sabre tooth tigers and giant elk, all of whom have a real taste for decoratively painted eggs...</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>At that decorative level, Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition is alright to look at. The animals are painted in a very particular style that grows out of US nature paintings and never looks great on a slot machine, but this is sufficiently offset by the well-wrought animations and involving sound design.</p>
<p>The music is dramatic and orchestral but feels like it should have been put on a very different game. It is the sort of music that needs muting very early in a playing session.</p>
<p>Overall though, at this superficial level, Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition is pretty inoffensive.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition is a six by four, any way wins slot. On a grid of that size that means there are 4,096 ways to win.</p>
<p>On top of this base game, Kalamba have also added a system of personal progressive jackpots which are won by hitting a combination of Jackpot symbols and Wilds.</p>
<p>Ten or more of these symbols combined in one spin wins the player the Silver Jackpot, twelve or more will pay out the Gold Jackpot and fourteen or more gets the Platinum Jackpot. Only the highest jackpot pays out, so you don't also get the Silver and Gold ones if you hit the Platinum Jackpot.</p>
<p>The jackpots are seeded with 20x, 1,00x and 1,000x your current bet (this changes when you increase or decrease your bet), plus a small contribution from every spin. 3.75% of every bet is split between the three jackpots.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol and can come with a x2 or x3 modifier. The modified Wilds count as two or three symbols respectively for the purposes of both winning combinations and for counting towards Jackpot wins.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Bonus symbols triggers a free spin bonus game. Based on how many Bonus symbols you hit you can get 8 to 20 free spins, which can be retriggered (during the bonus round you can also retrigger 3 spins for two Bonus symbols). During the free spins all Wilds have x2 or x3 multipliers attached.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.94%. We are pretty happy with that, as it comes to almost a full percentage point above our rough average of 96% for the industry.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested went from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.60 – rather high for any low stakes players out there – up to a maximum of $/£/€600.00 per spin. So the 1% are very well taken care of here.</p>
<p>Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition also comes with very high volatility making it a great match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mammoth Chase: Easter Edition is a visually tolerable game, but with its decent RTP and huge volatility it is a great match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>If you enjoy yourself a good jackpot based experience, this might be a good match for you.</p>
