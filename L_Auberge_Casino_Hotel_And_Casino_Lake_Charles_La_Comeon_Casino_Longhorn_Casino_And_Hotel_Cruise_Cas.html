<p>The Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which is part of the Division of Industrial Relations (DIR) revealed last week that penalties were issued for the Aria hotel-casino in Las Vegas and Eureka Owl Club in Eureka. The monetary penalties outline alleged breaches of state COVID-19 health and safety regulations.</p>
<p>According to last week’s report by OSHA, the penalty for Aria was $12,617. The alleged violation which OSHA described was “lack of social distancing at point-of-sale terminals used by employees“. In contrast, the penalty which OSHA issued for the Eureka Owl Club was $2,950. The alleged violation of the Eureka Owl Club was described as employees not wearing face coverings or not wearing face coverings properly.</p>
<p>Data revealed by OSHA outlined that since June, DIR agents have conducted 9,655 inspections at various businesses. Based on those inspections, the overall compliance rate in Nevada is 89%. With that in mind, in total, OSHA has issued 177 citations and penalties to businesses for violations related to the COVID-19 health and safety guidelines.</p>
<p>The Response of Aria’s Owner – MGM Resorts</p>
<p>In March this year, the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19 forced casinos and other “non-essential” businesses to close in Nevada. After being shut for 70 days, casinos were allowed to reopen on June 4. In order to operate safely in the COVID-19 environment, operators had to implement strict health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>To ensure the health and safety of its visitors, the owner of Aria, MGM Resorts introduced its “Seven-Point Safety Plan”. Besides reducing the total capacity of each venue, the plan features mandatory wearing of masks, temperature screening and additional safety protocols.</p>
<p>“There is no higher priority than the health and safety of our guests and employees and nothing we take more seriously.” MGM Resorts</p>
<p>In response to the recent penalty, MGM Resorts released a statement outlining that Aria has been cooperating with OSHA. The operator said that it plans to contest the citation, believing that no health and safety laws were violated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, MGM stressed that the Seven-Point Safety Plan outlines clear policies for safe distancing and other important protocols. In conclusion, the operator said that its employees are extensively trained and MGM will continue to reinforce the protocols safeguarding the health of both employees and guests.</p>
