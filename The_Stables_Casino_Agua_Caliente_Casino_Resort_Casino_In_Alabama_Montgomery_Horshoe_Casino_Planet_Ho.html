    <h1>The Stables Casino Agua Caliente Casino Resort Casino In Alabama Montgomery Horshoe Casino Planet Ho</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So if that's the case then you have to go to the casino. to send my own money back, right?</p>
<p>You write now, I did not mention that I wanted to keep my money. How do you think there? So I send</p>
<p>Money to someone, just like that and do not expect anything ?????</p>
<p>Of course, I expect that I can use the service or just my money can book back. If the casino,</p>
<p>arbitrary for me, then my account locks, I can not do either. Here, too, I expect that to me</p>
<p>Money is refunded. Why do you see it differently?</p>
<p>So it seems arbitrary and for no apparent reason or?</p>
<p>Why should I, again prove my Einahung, again?</p>
<p>A dealer, where I order a smartphone for 800 euros, then pay it online, sees the money and sends me</p>
<p>then the goods immediately. If he does not have the goods, he will refund the money. Except scammers, they do not do it.</p>
<p>Why is it different here? They also ask if I want to keep my money, clearly I want it back, understand</p>
<p>You not? Why should the casino just keep it?</p>
<p>Also, exactly this account, my bank account, has been verified, so it has been accepted with this account and</p>
<p>now they pretend that it should not be my bank account, why? There is no reason to ask for more evidence here.</p>
<p>Only one answer came from the casino and it always comes from support, it can be requested.</p>
<p>If you do not find this arbitrary and out of order, then I ask you, why should the casino just make my money</p>
<p>allowed to keep?</p>
<p>It seems to me to be stalling tactics from the casino.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions are so incomprehensible and not fair to the customer.</p>
<p>If you and the casino see it differently, that's not my problem.</p>
<p>Normal money back and good but that is denied.</p>
<p>For me, this is cheating, no matter what is in the terms and conditions. It retains, unjustifiable, money from the customer.</p>
<p>If I send you money by bank transfer and you see it on your account slip, why</p>
<p>Should I then send a receipt that I have sent from my bank account? Understand</p>
<p>You what i mean? Why is it all there and where did I get your data from, if I did not</p>
<p>have an account and your service? It is already registered in the account (see the attachments in Mails before).</p>
<p>The account data should be there then or?</p>
<p>Why then prove everything again?</p>
<p>That's what I do not understand and value as arbitrariness and fraud.</p>
<p>I also do not want to talk to a casino if they have everything, my account was verified</p>
<p>and then this is no longer valid? What is their statements still worth?</p>
<p>With the deposit, it was blocked, for whatever reason, previously verified and now I am more evidence</p>
<p>send. Why? Everything was ok.</p>
<p>I think they do not even know that it is verified with my bank account, so they look at each other</p>
<p>Not at all. So what's not close to the customer yet customer friendly.</p>
<p>Will you tell me with whose guilt it is, now implying that I myself am guilty of having deposited there?</p>
<p>What should I still do as a customer? I send Belge for verification and everything is ok then?</p>
<p>Then I send money and just want that back. Who makes mistakes here, me?</p>
<p>There is no alternative, why? I even think that with an order check, that only goes to the</p>
<p>Person (so me) and the costs can be explained to me and deduct, if I then accept it.</p>
<p>Also, the casino can cancel the payment and then it goes back to the account where it came from. Where is</p>
<p>there a problem? I see it as fraud and arbitrariness.</p>
<p>If you find a casino allowed to keep money from customers, even if not verified, then I think so</p>
<p>concern. My account was verified here and still the casino wants to keep my money.</p>
