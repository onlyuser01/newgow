    <h1>Casino West Memphis Arkansas Horseshoe Casino Bay Mills Casino Casino Near Memphis Tn Hollywood Casi</h1>

<p>hello dear casino guru team,</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your support!</p>
<p>Well, I've never experienced anything so crazy with a casino!</p>
<p>I had won almost 100 euros with a free bonus (free spins).</p>
<p>The casino sets the condition that you must first make a deposit before you can cash out: That in itself is nothing unusual - but it really seems to me that they do everything, no matter how strange, not to cash out have to, because they have consistently refused to pay me since AUGUST!</p>
<p>So I chose my credit card as a deposit method, but the payment was simply refused and I was told to contact support. So I did and was told I had to get my credit card verified first. To DEPOSIT!??? I've really never experienced anything like this. But I did. And I got several written confirmations from them saying "Your account is now fully verified!" And - please see attachment! - it is also directly in my customer account as verified!!</p>
<p>But they don't care at all! So I went into the chat for the umpteenth time and protested that my credit card was "VERIFIED! FOR MONTHS!" - But it always came back as a stereotypical text module: "Please verify your credit card!".</p>
<p>(Note: I was talking/writing to a real human though, not a "bot", mentioning this just to avoid confusion. - It was acting like a bot though and completely ignoring me (his name is Aaron )).</p>
<p>I then started to lose heart and stubbornly repeated my reply until:</p>
<p>another "text module" from him - again and again until I gave up - came:</p>
<p>"The credit card you just tried to deposit with is not the same one you verified!"</p>
<p>I have to say I'm really stunned! This is a credit card that was automatically sent to me by my bank when I opened the account there. And I had never requested one before or after! Want to say: there IS only this ONE and always WAS only the ONE. This is complete nonsense!</p>
<p>Can you please help me? I bounce off a concrete wall!</p>
<p>They obviously don't want to pay out at all and do everything so that I can't deposit. I'll add: Of course, they also offer other payment methods: but these are only cryptocurrencies (which you can only use to pay out, by the way, you can't use a credit card, you can only make deposits with it: another kind of "barbed wire"). But I only have one "crypto account": and I first have to top up my balance with bitcoins, which is very laborious, and with a considerable minimum deposit amount. -Therefore I wanted to deposit via credit card. And I think to myself, even if I could somehow manage that with bitcoins: there would probably be a high probability that my deposit would ALSO be refused HERE.</p>
<p>Attached is a screenshot of my account balance there and the verification of my credit card (possibly enlarge it with a magnifying glass, it is at the bottom at the last place!).</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance and have a good week, greetings, Fabienne</p>
