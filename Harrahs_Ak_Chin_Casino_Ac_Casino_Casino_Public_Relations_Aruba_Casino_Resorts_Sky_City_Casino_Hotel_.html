<p>Martirosyan will be expected to leverage his financial industry experience to support the group's continuous growth in iGaming</p>
<p>Sports betting and casino platform provider, Digitain, continued its frenzy of new appointments and promotions with the appointment of Martin Martirosyan as its new deputy chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Experience to Support Further Growth</p>
<p>The addition of Martirosyan to the senior leadership team of Digitain brings a wealth of financial industry experience to the company gained across various positions in corporate business, products and risk management for HSBC.</p>
<p>Digitain founder Vardes Vardanyan commented on the news, outlining that Martirosyan, brings “that wealth of experience” needed by the group of companies as the business “continues to grow globally strategically across several multiple regulated markets” and the company continues to expand its roster of B2B partnerships.</p>
<p>Martirosyan, who holds a Ph.D. in economics, has spent most of his professional career working at HSBC, with his most recent role as the director of corporate banking and head of wholesale banking at the bank’s subsidiary in Armenia, HSBC Bank Armenia CJSC.</p>
<p>His other roles at HSBC include serving for a year between October 2015 and October 2016 as the senior business risk and control manager of global commercial banking, as well as the head of wholesale credit and market risk, deputy chief risk officer and deputy head of commercial banking, among others.</p>
<p>Also commenting on his appointment, Martirosyan expressed how “honored” he feels to be able “to join the Digitain Group” during times when the business experiences rapid expansion of its operations across “continental Europe, the UK and beyond.”</p>
<p>“The business is an example of a great organization, people, and culture, and technology delivery which has been recognized with multiple international and local industry and business awards,” he said, looking forward “to being part of this next period of Digitain’s growth story over the coming months and years ahead.”</p>
<p>New Appointments and Promotions</p>
<p>Martirosyan, who has also given lectures at the State Engineering University of Armenia, is the latest piece added to the new-look personnel puzzle at Digitain, following the opening of the group’s new office in Romania at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>First, Digitain promoted its chief business officer, Simon Westbury, to the role of chief executive officer at its subsidiary, Sport Generate, and tasked him with leveraging his more than 20 years of iGaming experience to foster growth and boost brand recognition.</p>
<p>In February, Digitain continued the managerial reshuffle by appointing Iain Hutchison as a chief revenue officer and charging him with responsibilities to spearhead the group’s revenue growth strategy and support efforts to expand the group’s global presence in the iGaming space.</p>
<p>Most recently, Digitain promoted its chief technology officer, Grigor Asoyan, to group deputy CEO of technology.</p>
