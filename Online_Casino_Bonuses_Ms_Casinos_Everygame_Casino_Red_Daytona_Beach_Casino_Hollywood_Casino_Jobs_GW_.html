    <h1>Online Casino Bonuses Ms Casinos Everygame Casino Red Daytona Beach Casino Hollywood Casino Jobs GW</h1>

<p>Made withdrawal request, as site conditions say, 3 lots of $5,000.00 withdrawal requests. My winnings were over $50,000.00 but it was not allowed to make a request until after 10 days, so I had a large amount in balance which I was playing with and winnings kept adding on. When I made the withdrawal request I also send in identification documents of valid licence and a valid passport. I left it with the casino to do its verification. In the mean time my balance hit zero but I still had he requested withdrawals set a site safe. After 4 days I noticed my withdrawals were not visible and thought identification process must have complete and the amounts are in the process, when I logged into chat. I was told the withdrawals were reversed back into my balance in a way as if to make fun of me which I have lost and balance is nil. I must have played them not noticing the addition because of the large balance. I asked why this was done, I was told I’d incomplete and need a utility bill. I said yeah all cool easly done, why reverse the withdrawal. Why was not asked for the missing document and advised about the reversal. I was told the system reversed it. I said ok and the asked for document when was this going to be requested from me. I have no emails about anything . Basically they have deliberately waited for my balance to get big and reversed the withdrawal so it would not be realised to make sure no withdrawals were made. I have made withdrawals before, the pending sits there and will not be reversed or processed until all requests are met. They did not message me while on site playing nor did they send me an email about anything. I found out logging onto chat to enquire, this site should not be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>the stealing people monies and they are intentionally making sure no money is paid out, I am devasted. I had told my family about the winning promising them financial help for there disabled child and current condition, what will I tell them now. How can I keep the promise I made. This not right a,d it’s cruel. I have promised money to people that are in need and looking forward to receiving the help promised. I promised them relying on the withdrawals I had made thinking they were safe from loosing. I have not got that money to keep my promise. I feel awful and these people are going to feel worse when they realise there hopes have been crushed.</p>
