<p>Greyhound Racing Victoria (GRV) announced a new partnership agreement with Australian broadcaster Sky Racing, extending the outlet’s broadcasting rights by another four years. The Melbourne-based Greyhound Racing Victoria manages 13 tracks and is in charge of regulating the sport in the state of Victoria, Australia. According to GRV, the partnership will help popularize greyhound racing as it develops additional content for Sky.</p>
<p>The Partnership Aims to Popularize the Sport</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership, Sky Racing will be GRV’s official domestic, international, and digital distributor and broadcaster. The new deal includes extended time slots for Victorian greyhound racing, dedicated showcases, and new digital marketing to increase awareness of the sport.</p>
<p>Adam Brownlee, General Manager of Sky Operations, expressed his commitment to popularizing greyhound racing and creating more betting opportunities. He noted the broadcaster’s excitement to be GRV’s primary media partner. His hope was for the partnership to further strengthen their relationship.</p>
<p>It’s a win for punters, industry participants, and our almost two million viewers every year… Adam Brownlee, General Manager of Sky Operations</p>
<p>Brownlee stated that Sky Racing would collaborate with GRV to diversify viewing and engagement opportunities and provide punters with more appealing content. According to him, the deal was a prime opportunity to help grow the sport and give greyhound racing fans the content they wanted.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Opportunities Receive Special Attention</p>
<p>Acting Chief Executive Officer of GRV Stuart Laing stated that the deal would be very beneficial for greyhound racing both in Australia and internationally and would help cement it as a top wagering product. He also noted that the partnership would give fans and betters unparalleled access to the sport and allow GRV to offer better promotional content like feature events, star greyhounds, and participants.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to working even more closely with Sky Racing to be more innovative in the way we showcase our sport to punters. Stuart Laing, Acting CEO of Greyhound Racing Victoria</p>
<p>Wagering opportunities appear to be a priority for GRV and Tabcorp, the company which owns Sky Racing. It is Australia’s largest gambling operator and manages several TV channels and a radio service.</p>
<p>Brownlee emphasized that increasing the popularity of greyhound racing would help Tabcorp leverage its betting business and increase its market share. The company is preparing an extensive refresh of its betting app and would greatly benefit from increased interest in the sport. To that end, Tabcorp plans to entice betters with new digital initiatives and supplementary content from its team of analysts.</p>
