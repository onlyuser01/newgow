    <h1>Rich Palms Casino Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Casino In Niagara Casino Hotels In Albuquerque New Mex</h1>

<p>Dear Psicho,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I checked the casino’s T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>"SELF-EXCLUSION &amp; TIME-OUT</p>
<p>If you are finding that your gameplay is having a negative effect on you, you can set a break of one day, one week or one month under ‘TIME-OUT’ section of your Ditobet account.</p>
<p>If you decide to self-exclude or time-out, you will not be allowed access to your account before your chosen, set period has passed and you will no longer receive any marketing material from Ditobet during this period. Should you wish to re-open your account after the period has passed, you will be required to contact our customer support.</p>
<p>We offer the following self-exclusion time frames:</p>
<p>6 months</p>
<p>1 year</p>
<p>3 years</p>
<p>5 years</p>
<p>In order to request Self-exclusion, please download the application ApplicationSE.pdf, fill it handwritten and scan it. Send the application to support@ditobet.com. As technical processing time could take up to 30 days, you can always instantly time-out from your profile for this period.</p>
<p>If you would like to prolong your self-exclusion period or require any further information in this regard, we kindly ask you to reach out to our customer support services team with your request at support@ditobet.com"</p>
<p>Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure? My email address is kristina.s@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
