    <h1>The Movie Casino Cast Santa Fe Station Hotel Casino Casino Restaurants Casino Connecticut Usa Bally</h1>

<p>UK-based sports betting and iGaming operator Betfred announced Thursday its US subsidiary Betfred USA Sports signed an exclusive marketing agreement with Rod Smith to make him the first spokesperson for the sportsbook since its launch.</p>
<p>Betfred Ambassador</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the sports betting company and the all-time great receiver of the franchise from the National Football League (NFL) Denver Broncos Rod Smith agreed to a role for the two-time American Football champion in terms of interaction with sports bettors in Colorado, as well as fans on social media, while representing Betfred in online and in-person promotional activities.</p>
<p>“Rod is easily the greatest receiver in Broncos history and a Broncos legend.” Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>The appointment of the three-time all-star, two-time American Football champion and Ring of Fame member as an ambassador for the Betfred brand is further deepening the partnership the sportsbook operator and Denver Broncos agreed to in June 2020.</p>
<p>Betfred announced it teamed up with the NFL franchise just a day ahead of the launch of its official sportsbook at Saratoga Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado, which marked a debut for the UK-based gaming company in the state.</p>
<p>“When we were searching for a brand ambassador and marketing partner, we wanted someone of his stature on the field, but also someone who is intimately involved in the community off the field. We could not be more excited about working with Rod to make Betfred Sports a household name in Colorado.” Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>Customers Treated Like Family</p>
<p>The new ambassador for Betfred Rod Smith highlighted the importance for all sports fans to be able to place bets on their favorite teams, stressing on the family-like approach to sports fans and customers Betfred undertakes in communities in which it operates as the most decisive argument in favor of accepting the proposal from the sportsbook.</p>
<p>“I know what it takes to be the best, so I look forward to working with them in this exciting and competitive world of sports betting in the great state of Colorado.” Rod Smith, Spokesperson, Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>Since its launch in Colorado, Betfred entered into a partnership deal with Mohegan Sun Casino at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas to assume responsibilities for the sports betting operations at the casino.</p>
<p>In November, Betfred opened a retail sportsbook at Wind Creek Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, followed by the launch of its mobile app in December, again via the gaming and entertainment property operated by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians.</p>
