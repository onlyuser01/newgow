<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We've been discussing the topic of cutting bonus winnings within CasinoGuru recently and we would like to know what the preferences are when it comes to you - the players.</p>
<p>By taking a closer look at our Complaints section, you'll find out players sometimes deal with one common issue. Let's look at the example:</p>
<p>Player X receives a bonus of 50 USD with 30x wagering requirement and plays with the bonus money. When he finishes the wagering requirement, he has the balance of 400 USD. Let's say the maximum allowed withdrawal from the bonus is 100 USD.</p>
<p>The player X continues playing after the wagering is finished and wins even more. The current balance is 2 000 USD. The player X finally decides to make a withdrawal. Then the casino cuts all the winnings and leaves the player with 100 USD, because the bonus terms and conditions still apply until a withdrawal is made.</p>
<p>Another case is that whenever the player finishes the wagering requirement, the balance of 400 USD is immediately cut to the withdrawable amount of 100 USD and the player can continue playing without any restrictions or they can ask for a withdrawal.</p>
<p>So would you prefer to lose all your excessive bonus money immediately once you reach the wagering requirement and being left with only the withdrawable amount or would you prefer to keep all the bonus winnings and make this decision on your own by asking for a withdrawal and then having the balance reduced by the casino accordingly?</p>
<p>Thank you all for your insights!</p>
