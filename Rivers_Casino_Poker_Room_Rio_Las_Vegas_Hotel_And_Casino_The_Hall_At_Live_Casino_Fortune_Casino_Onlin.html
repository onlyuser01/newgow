<p>The deal will see popular games from the iGaming developer expand the offering of Salsa Gator, Salsa's aggregator platform</p>
<p>The leading business-to-business (B2B) developer of customized solutions catering to the iGaming sector in Europe, as well as Latin America, Salsa Technology, announced it forged a new partnership with the Malta-based provider of mobile games, Darwin Gaming. Under the terms of the new agreement, announced Monday, Darwin Gaming agreed to deliver top-performing games, powering Salsa Technology’s aggregator platform, Salsa Gator.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration, more players are going to be able to reach popular games from Darwin Gaming. The collaboration will also help strengthen Salsa’s aggregator platform, complementing its growth and position within the competitive online gambling sector. Under the terms of the new agreement, the company’s partners will have the option to engage with new games provided by Darwin Gaming.</p>
<p>Such games will include popular instant win titles like Luva PowerBasket, as well as Luva Melhor do Mundo. Salsa’s B2B customers will also be able to deliver thrilling crash games like Crash Evolution and Luva SuperGoal, among others.</p>
