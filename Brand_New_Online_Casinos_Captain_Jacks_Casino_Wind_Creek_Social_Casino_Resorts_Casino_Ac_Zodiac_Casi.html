    <h1>Brand New Online Casinos Captain Jacks Casino Wind Creek Social Casino Resorts Casino Ac Zodiac Casi</h1>

<p>So I have been playing this online casino mirax casino I had made a few small deposits with my crypto wallet from my BTC wallet on coinbase.</p>
<p>I had a win and tried to withdrawl of first 1000 then 2500 then 4000 I tried to make withdrawl to my registered visa debit card ,so I had $7500 pending withdrawl and $1200 still in my account.</p>
<p>In the morning I woke up ,signed back into my account I had 5000 in totall back in casino account I looked at transactions and withdrawls had all been declined and then contacted support to find out what the go was with the transaction of winnings and shortfall of winnings that appeared back in my account I should of had around $8500 but only $5000 I then went on to communicate with support that said all my declined withdrawals had been put back in my account and that was it.so then they told me that I needed to comform my identity license addresses ect so I did .support then said I can make withdrawal same way I deposited with my btc wallet I then went on to make withdrawal of $4000 to my BTC wallet as That's what the maximum withdrawal amount was I sent my reseaving BTC wallet address and successfully withdrawal $4000 I never got a receipt of withdrawal just an email saying congratulations on your win and my withdrawal had been made .I waited and waited for funds to show in my wallet but nothing, I then contacted support again and asked for a receipt of the transaction so I could find on the block chain to see were my funds were sent,they then sent me a receipt of address they sent funds to and it was a BCH Address that I had never seen or used befor they then went on to say that funds were unrecoverable and there was nothing they could do at there end.</p>
