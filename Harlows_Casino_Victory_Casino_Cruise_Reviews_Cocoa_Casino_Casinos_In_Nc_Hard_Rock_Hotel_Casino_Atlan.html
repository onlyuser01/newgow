    <h1>Harlows Casino Victory Casino Cruise Reviews Cocoa Casino Casinos In Nc Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlan</h1>

<p>We received the following email from the player:</p>
<p>Hi Veronica.</p>
<p>I hope you are doing well. As I wanted to delete my parimatch account for good due to the following reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Due to gambling addict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its the second time I deposited my money but they force me to play the bonus games so that it will be difficult to wager my balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have decided to move on from parimatch. So i dont want to get their promotion offers to my mobile since I dont need to betting from parimatch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And about refusing to close my account parimatch Tanzania asked me to provide my voters Id that is captures on a white paper. I provided that.</p>
<p>They asked me that to provide again that id with the title "for parimatch" and add a date on that. I did that too. But they refuse to close my account.</p>
<p>I contacted them they say my providings are not enough to close my account. They asked me to provide the second data with a screenshot of me holding that ID with my hands seen. I did that too.</p>
<p>They asked again thats info are not enough. I should take a selfie with me. My Id , and a white paper that was written for parimatch and a date.</p>
<p>I did my best and provided that. And they say they received successful. But they have not deleted my account till today.</p>
<p>Could you please advise when exactly you sent the last document needed for successful verification? Has it been approved by the casino?</p>
<p>Have you informed the casino of your gambling addiction? Please forward the email you sent to Parimatch with your account closure request to veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If it's possible, please write your replies directly to this complaint thread. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
