<p>Gaming Innovation Group has upped the ante for its partners seeking to elevate the jackpot experience and introduce their audiences to more worthwhile and value-added gameplay sessions.</p>
<p>The company has announced a partnership with Jooba Tech, a firm that has built a proprietary Jackpot Management System which will significantly enhance partner operator’s ability to deliver fresh jackpot joys to players, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release.</p>
<p>The system is integrated through GiG Marketplace, and it will become available to GiG clients who will in turn be able to group together games from different providers and launch jackpot offers for different games in their existing libraries.</p>
<p>Jackpots have become an important part of the iGaming experience, creating strong engagement and reward incentives for players. Jooba Tech Co-Founder Tom Finlayson has welcomed the opportunity to see this partner shape up and allow his company to expand its product reach, bringing more innovation in the online casino vertical through the proprietary solutions offered by Jooba:</p>
<p>"It is a huge coup for us to partner with one of the most recognizable brands within the industry and which offers a world-class platform. We have invested heavily in building our Jackpot Management System to making it a market leading solution that will enable operators to optimize their player experience."</p>
<p>GiG Business Development Manager Rebecca Attard was similarly excited about this opportunity, adding that Jooba Tech’s solution made it possible to launch jackpots on any game through the GiG Marketplace product, guaranteeing differentiation to partner operators’ offerings and portfolios.</p>
<p>The jackpot experience can be further tailored to meet specific customer needs, so that operators may apply final tweaks to the overall performance and create much more targeted jackpots.</p>
<p>Jooba Tech allows GiG’s partners to step into the world of jackpot innovation with one of the most powerful tools on their hands, benefiting from seamless integration and impactful execution. GiG has kept a firm focus on innovating its product portfolio and bringing worthwhile solutions to its partners in bulk.</p>
<p>Recently, the company announced a similarly important partnership with Livespins, a company that turns the slot experience into shared, socially charged gameplay sessions for its operators. The Livespins integration has been a success, now doubly strengthened by the arrival of Jooba Tech’s original jackpot solutions.</p>
