<p>Tonali’s illegal gambling might cause his former team trouble as Newcastle reportedly mull over suing AC Milan</p>
<p>The soccer gambling scandal in Italy continues with Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali reportedly set to receive a suspension from competing. Tonali and other players, including Nicolo Zniolo and Nicolo Fagioli, were found guilty of betting on sports, breaching Article 24 of the Sporting Justice Code.</p>
<p>Reports say that Tonali will be allowed to compete in the upcoming Champions League match against Borussia Dortmund. However, this will likely be his final participation in a competitive game before a suspension kicks in.</p>
<p>Tonali, who wagered on sports illegally, is set to undergo months of addiction therapy. The player will also be included in anti-gambling initiatives. In any case, the athlete is likely to be suspended from competing professionally for multiple months.</p>
<p>The Italian soccer player will likely receive a 10-month suspension.</p>
<p>Newcastle May Sue Milan</p>
<p>The current scandal may also lead to a lawsuit in the world of professional soccer.</p>
<p>According to reports, Newcastle may sue AC Milan, Tonali’s former team. For reference, the midfielder was transferred in July. As a result, Newcastle will now suffer being a player down because of Tonali’s previous transgressions which his former team may have been aware of.</p>
<p>In any case, the soccer club will continue to support Tonali despite the scandal. In an earlier statement, Newcastle pointed out that the athlete was fully compliant with the investigation.</p>
<p>Fagioli’s Doctor Says More Athletes Are Likely Involved</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nicolo Fagioli received a 12-month ban, eventually reduced to only 7 off-field months because of his cooperation with the investigation. Fagioli, who admitted to having gambling problems, started gambling as a pastime but eventually lost control of his habits.</p>
<p>Paolo Jarre, the doctor responsible for Fagioli’s gambling treatment, described the athlete as a polite and subdued man whose condition is not as bad as it could have been. Jarre is convinced that Fagioli will be able to make a full recovery from his addiction and return to competing.</p>
<p>However, the doctor pointed out that there are likely many other players involved in this illegal gambling scheme.</p>
