    <h1>Casino Gangster Movie Casino In India Downs Casino Best Vegas Casino Casinos Downtown EveryMatrix br</h1>

<p>EveryMatrix has made another notable change to its C-level team, with Gonzalo De Osma Bucero stepping in as the company’s Chief Financial Officer. In his new position, Gonzalo will oversee a number of financial and legal operations and ensure that EveryMatrix Group’s performance falls in line with pre-established benchmarks.</p>
<p>The new appointment is a man of talent and renown in the gambling industry, having spent more than 16 years with Codere, and helping its operations across numerous big markets, including Malta, Spain, and Mexico where he worked personally.</p>
<p>He is well-versed in the financial needs of large-scale gambling businesses and has the track record to back this up. In his time with Codere, he helped manage 90 land-based casinos’ financial teams, and he is very familiar with the Latin American challenge.</p>
<p>His time with the company is also associated with resilience which was tested during the pandemic, and he helped sign a merger via SPAC for the company as well oversaw the online division’s listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange in the United States. All in all, Gonzalo brings vast experience with him which will now be put to good use as part of EveryMatrix’s team.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix CEO Ebbe Groes naturally hailed the arrival of the executive. He said that EveryMatrix was constantly on the move and was looking to deliver on ever-greater designs and plans, and having Gonzalo’s financial expertise on board would certainly make this journey easier.</p>
<p>"We spent a significant amount of time identifying the best candidate for this crucial role and Gonzalo stood head and shoulders above the rest," Groes added, and hailed Gonzalo’s time with Codere and his track record in helping the company overcome its online and retail challenges, as well as achieve better results in regulated and demanding markets.</p>
<p>For his part, Gonzalo was thrilled to have the opportunity to become a part of EveryMatrix’s team. "I’m looking forward to getting to know the team and every element of this great business so we can achieve the ambitious but achievable goals we have set ourselves," he noted.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has had many reasons to celebrate of late. The company has been reaping some solid benefits in the regulated iGaming market in the United States, as confirmed by its President of Americas, Erik Nyman, who spoke with Casino Guru News earlier this year and revealed EveryMatrix’s ambitious plans in the market.</p>
<p>Gonzalo will undoubtedly assist in the company’s ambitious aspirations for the iGaming market in North America and beyond.</p>
