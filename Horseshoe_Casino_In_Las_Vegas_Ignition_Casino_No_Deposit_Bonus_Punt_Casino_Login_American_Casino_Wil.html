    <h1>Horseshoe Casino In Las Vegas Ignition Casino No Deposit Bonus Punt Casino Login American Casino Wil</h1>

<p>My problem isnt their refusal to pay out, my problem is that in order for them to process my winnings they need not only my full credit card numbers used, intending to use or used at a sister casino, as well as scans of the card front and backs as well!</p>
<p>I provided valid I'd, proof of address and proof of identity (via selfie their system takes?). That should be enough, but my cc numbers and photos of them to process an outgoing payment to me, not from me screams of fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>I emailed them and asked why they need full numbers, and stated that it wasnt safe for me, and when I make a deposit they dont even get that info, their processor does, so why do they need it. No response as of yet.</p>
