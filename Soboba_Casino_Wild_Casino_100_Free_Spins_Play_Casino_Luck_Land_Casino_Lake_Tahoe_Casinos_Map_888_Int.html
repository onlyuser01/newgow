<p>888 Holdings, the leading online betting and gaming company, announced its latest “888 Made to Play” campaign.</p>
<p>Leading Operator 888 Launches New Campaign</p>
<p>888 is an unquestionable leader with more than two decades of experience within the gaming industry. Yet, the company continues to make efforts to reaffirm the trust of its users. Thanks to the new Made to Play campaign, 888 seeks to unify its strong brands 888casino, 888poker and 888sport under “under a single, consistent message.” Moreover, the company said that the new campaign seeks to unify businesses and people under a single shared vision.</p>
<p>Initially, 888’s latest campaign will launch in the UK. The company will use a variety of digital channels including social media and TV, introducing advertisements that will run for several weeks. Besides the UK, 888 plans to debut its innovative campaign for other markets as well. With that in mind, the company is yet to confirm when Made to Play will enter other key markets.</p>
<p>“The launch of our Made to Play master brand strategy is an important step for us, combining each of the strong brands we have built over the years under a consistent message that articulates what makes 888 stand out from the crowd and why our customers love playing with us.” Sivan Finn Shalev, VP of strategic marketing at 888</p>
<p>888’s VP of strategic marketing, Sivan Finn Shalev, outlined that the launch of the master brand strategy marks an important step for the company. Moreover, he said that combining 888’s strong brands under a consistent message makes the company stand out from the rest of the gaming operators.</p>
<p>888 Plans Further Growth, Entering New Jurisdictions</p>
<p>The new master brand strategy introduced by 888 comes as no surprise. In fact, earlier this week, upon releasing its annual financial results for the full year 2021, the company hinted its plan for Made to Play. Itai Panzer, 888’s CEO, said that the company will “relaunch the 888 brand under a master brand strategy called Made to Play, built on the solid foundations of our award-winning poker campaign by the same name.”</p>
<p>Moreover, during 2021, the Gibraltar-based gambling group has seen a 15% increase in revenue to $980.1 million. In contrast, the company’s revenue in 2020 halted at $849.7 million. Besides growth during 2021, 888 revealed that it plans to launch its services in multiple markets this year. While the company said that it plans to enter Ontario, it is also considering expanding its presence in more US jurisdictions. Another lucrative option for 888 is to re-enter the Netherlands.</p>
