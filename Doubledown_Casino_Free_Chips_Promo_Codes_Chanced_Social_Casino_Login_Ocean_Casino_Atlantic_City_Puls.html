    <h1>Doubledown Casino Free Chips Promo Codes Chanced Social Casino Login Ocean Casino Atlantic City Puls</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have asked several times to terminate my account, to never play again. They were not willing to do that. What kind of supportive service is that. I wanted the request because i didnt like their service. Withdrawals took so long, where u were tempted to cancle and gamble again. I could not lock my accoutn for ever myself, the live chat couldnt do it for me, only per mail. The email sent me a bonus, because i lost money after a week waiting for my withdrawal to be processed. I ended up cancelling and losing it all.</p>
<p>The support per mail was sorry for hearing it and they gave me a bonus. In the live chat i asked them what the rules were. Answer: 35 wagering. So i did, ending up with a nice profit, which i withdrew.</p>
<p>2 days later. My withdrawal was rejected and the amount of money never to be seen again. Why? because of the max bet in live casino's was suppose to be 5 euro per bet. I played the 50 euro BJ tables.</p>
<p>well, what i dont understand is the following;</p>
<p>In the bonus page the amount of wagering money is given.</p>
<p>When is play 50 euro's, the bet should be rejected. It is bonus money.</p>
<p>If accepted, it should not be deducted of the wagering amount. That amount should remain the same!! Like in other big sites.</p>
<p>Ive mailed them, no reaction.</p>
<p>So i expect the money to be back in my account, where i can play with 5â‚¬ per bet. I had 13 days left to meet the conditions.</p>
<p>This site is really scam, misleading. Terms and conditions are hidden. Like a player reads all the 60 articles when a bonus is given.</p>
<p>Never ever going back!</p>
