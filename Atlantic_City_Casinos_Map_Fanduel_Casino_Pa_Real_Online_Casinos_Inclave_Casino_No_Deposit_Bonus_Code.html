    <h1>Atlantic City Casinos Map Fanduel Casino Pa Real Online Casinos Inclave Casino No Deposit Bonus Code</h1>

<p>Wazamba sent me an offer on Thursday 22/06 to reopen my account with 100% bonus up to 400 euros with 5x wagering. I took that offer wagered the bonus and managed to take the account to a total of 4.1k by Saturday. By Sunday I also had some big wins on QuickWin which is a casino of the same company and took my account from 700 euros to 2200 euros. On Monday 26/06 18:00 they sent me an email from Wazamba because I failed to send them the docs for verification (???) which they never requested and the account at that point was open for 4 days. They took all my wins from wazamba (3.7k) and returned my deposit. After that they closed my account in Quickwin without any reason at all and took 100% of my money there (2.2k). Minedu i had opened an account in quickwin on June 9th so 17 days ago! One day later they said the same reason for QuickWin that I failed verification which they also never asked for!!! And they claim because of their Term 6.6.4 which states that they can request for documentation in order to withdraw and I need to send the docs within 30 days otherwise the account will be closed and profits will be withheld!!!! I had an account for 17 days and they closed it because I failed to deliver the required documentation after 30 days that they had requested them (???) I guess I'm a time traveller now. Weirdest part is that on the same day I had accepted a similar offer from one of their other casinos 7signs to reopen and take the bonus and was about to deposit. Next day when they had banned me from all of their casinos they were wondering from 7sign how come I hadn't deposited yet!!!??? Any suggestions on what to do since they went ahead and stole 6.3k of my money?</p>
