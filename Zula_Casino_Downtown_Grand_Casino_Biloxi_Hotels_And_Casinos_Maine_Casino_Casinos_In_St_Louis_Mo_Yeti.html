    <h1>Zula Casino Downtown Grand Casino Biloxi Hotels And Casinos Maine Casino Casinos In St Louis Mo Yeti</h1>

<p>Dear Hester,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the casino's Responsible Gambling Policy and I found this:</p>
<p>"Clients reserve the right to select a 7 day, 30 day, 6 month, 1year or even a permanent exclusion period in their accounts."</p>
<p>"Full Exclusion:</p>
<p>All clients of Yeti Casino reserve the right to exclude themselves at any given period of time from any casino activity. The exclusion process can be done by adjusting the "lock account" option to "forever", therefore resulting in the closure of the casino account.</p>
<p>Important - Clients must always remember that once an account is fully excluded, all pending balances will be lost and the account cannot be reopened."</p>
<p>And this is what I found in general T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>A player can instruct us to exclude him or her from making use of the gaming services for a specific period of time (from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 5 years) by contacting Customer Services. In asking Customer Services to exclude a player from Yeticasino.com and our Services, a player acknowledges and agrees that we will block that player’s Account from placing gambling transactions for the period requested, starting as soon as possible after receipt of your request (and, in any event, no later than the next time a player tries and logs in). The self-exclusion will be applied to all websites operated by us and members of our Group (please note that there may be a short delay in applying the self-exclusion to websites operated by other members of our Group)."</p>
<p>Could you please clarify how exactly you requested self-exclusion? Was it via your account or via support?</p>
<p>Have you tried discussing this issue with the casino? Please forward all the relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru, or you can post it here.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
