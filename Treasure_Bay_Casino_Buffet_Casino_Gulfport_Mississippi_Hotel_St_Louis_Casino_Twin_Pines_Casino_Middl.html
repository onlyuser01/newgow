    <h1>Treasure Bay Casino Buffet Casino Gulfport Mississippi Hotel St Louis Casino Twin Pines Casino Middl</h1>

<p>SportCaller has decided to continue a successful partnership with William Hill in a bid to benefit from the operator’s success and streamline how the British company engages with its vast player base. The companies are introducing the free-to-play Golden race ahead of the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>SportCaller Extends Partnership with William Hill</p>
<p>William Hill and SportCaller, the free-to-play sports game company, will continue working together in order to optimize customer engagement. The partnership started early in 2018 and has been extended to 2019 and possibly beyond. The brands will introduce the Golden Race, a new contest offering £1 million in ready cash money, which will ask of participants to bet on the finishing order of runners every day.</p>
<p>To be eligible for betting, customers will have to meet a minimum bet of £10 and stand a chance at the big pot of money. If the jackpot isn’t won, £50,000 will be handed out to the person who have guessed the order of the first two finishers.</p>
<p>Good for Customers, Good for Business</p>
<p>SportCaller has managed to deliver intelligent racing speculators, allowing business and players to benefit in equal measure. The game has been a success for customers with the £1 million jackpot dropping already once and another £100,000 jackpot granted to anther lucky customer.</p>
<p>Associated increase in betting has been noted, driving revenue for the platform up, although it hasn’t been specified by how much exactly. Golden Race, though, is designed by SportCaller with the exquisite purpose of managing to keep all players on board after playing once.</p>
<p>SportCaller’s Cillian Barry had this to say about the new partnership:</p>
<p>Having originated the first free-to-play jackpot game with Channel 4 Racing way back in 2014, it’s great to return to our first love ahead of Cheltenham with the next generation in horse racing FTP.</p>
<p>SportCaller platforms’ successs has so far been significant, managing to pull interest for William Hill and partner platforms. The latest arrival is coinciding with the Cheltenham Festival, one of the major and most significant horse races that will take place tomorrow, March 12, and provide William Hill customers with plenty of options to place a wager.</p>
<p>William Hill Commercial Director Liam Wallwork has said:</p>
<p>Having successfully showcased the potential of FTP with our popular Lucky 7 racing game, we were keen to recruit SportCaller’s services again for Cheltenham, a tentpole event for us where client retention is invariably at a premium. SportCaller has again delivered on a refreshing new FTP which has already proved a boon for player engagement.</p>
<p>William Hill has made sure that Golden Race is already part of the full software suit of the platform, allowing customers to take a shot at the Cheltenham Festival odds and predictions. The game has already been optimized for mobile play, providing William Hill customers with a quick way to place their wagers hours before the event and get a shot at the £1 million prize pool.</p>
<p>Focusing on Retention</p>
<p>This is far from William Hill’s first strategic partnership. SportCaller has become one of the first platforms to stress the importance of enhancing new verticals and work on organic growth as opposed to affiliates. Another important industry-changing realization has been the introduction of practices that stimulate retention rather than hoping to drive traffic and then convert people.</p>
