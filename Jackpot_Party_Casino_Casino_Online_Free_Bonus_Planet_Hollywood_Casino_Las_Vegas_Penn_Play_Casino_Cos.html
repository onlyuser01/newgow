<p>The fight saw ‚ÄúThe Bronze Bomber‚Äù knock Fury down once, showing how good this guy is when it comes to striking. In fact, many believe that he‚Äôs the boxer with the most devastating strikes in the world.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that 42 of his 43 wins happened by knockout/technical knockout. Further, two of his previous three wins happened in the first round. Will we see the same happen on December 23 in Saudi Arabia? Betting odds sure suggest that might happen.</p>
<p>Joseph Parker Hoping to Upset the Odds</p>
<p>Joseph Parker is 33-3 overall with 23 wins by knockout. He won the vacant IBF and WBO Inter-Continental titles in October after beating Simon Kean by KO in the third round.</p>
<p>It was his third win of the year, as well as his second straight win inside the distance. Before that bout, we saw him win by TKO against Faiga Opelu in round 1. However, he‚Äôs never fought such a good opponent as Wilder.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. The fact that this is the biggest fight of his life means that he‚Äôs going to go all-in on December 23.</p>
<p>Deontay Wilder vs. Joseph Parker Prediction</p>
<p>Joseph Parker had only about two months to prepare for the biggest bout of his life. Meanwhile, Wilder hasn‚Äôt been inside the ring in more than a year.</p>
<p>That said, it‚Äôs clear that the American has an advantage. Still, even if that wasn‚Äôt the case, we‚Äôd still back ‚ÄúThe Bronze Bomber.‚Äù After all, he‚Äôs one of the best heavyweight boxers in the world today.</p>
<p>We think he‚Äôs going to win this fight by a knockout, which could potentially book him a mega-fight with Tyson Fury/Oleksandr Usyk/Anthony Joshua in 2024.</p>
<p>Pick: Deontay Wilder by KO/TKO</p>
