<p>Sports betting and technology company DraftKings announced a new initiative seeking to remind players of the importance of responsible gambling and mark the American Gaming Association (AGA)’s Responsible Gaming Education Month (RGEM).</p>
<p>It’s Cool to Cool Down from Betting</p>
<p>The Practice Safe Bets advertising campaign comprises two commercials featuring professional wrestler The Miz and legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk and will air in radio and TV markets nationwide, as well as on the company’s social media channels, looking to emphasize the importance of responsible gaming and the responsible gaming tools at players’ disposal within the DraftKings app.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new campaign, DraftKings’ chief marketing officer Stephanie Sherman outlined the opportunity for the company presented by responsible gaming advertising to reach its players “in a fun and educational way.”</p>
<p>“We chose The Miz and Tony Hawk for the Practice Safe Bets campaign because of their extensive fan bases and because their personalities will break through the noise to reinforce why using responsible gaming tools is so important,” Sherman concluded.</p>
<p>Produced by DraftKings’ creative and media agency VaynerMedia, both commercials are partly inspired by the “The More You Know” public service announcements in the 1990s and are infused with retro costumes and backgrounds.</p>
<p>To remind players that they can set deposit and time limits, Tony Hawk wears a helmet and kneepads, while The Miz, in a metallic costume, exudes a “cool factor” as if saying to players that cooling off from betting from time to time is cool.</p>
<p>Marking AGA’s RGEM</p>
<p>The Practice Safe Bets campaign is a display of DraftKings’ endorsement of AGA’s inaugural Responsible Gaming Education Month in September and further strengthens the operator’s track record of setting standards in terms of responsible gaming marketing.</p>
<p>During the RGEM, a free-to-play pool will be available to eligible customers at DraftKings, allowing them to test their knowledge of responsible gaming while the operator will provide the answers on its Safer Play Portal.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ It’s More Fun When It’s For Fun responsible gaming tagline as part of the company’s brand and marketing strategy perfectly aligns with AGA’s ‘Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly’ public campaign.</p>
<p>As part of its responsible gambling efforts, DraftKings sponsored the 2022 National Conference on Gambling Addiction and Responsible Gambling held by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) in partnership with the Massachusetts Council on Gaming and Health (MACGH) in July.</p>
<p>In June, DraftKings teamed with responsible gaming charity BetBlocker to become the charity’s partner, promote its software solution and urge those affected by gambling harm to seek help.</p>
