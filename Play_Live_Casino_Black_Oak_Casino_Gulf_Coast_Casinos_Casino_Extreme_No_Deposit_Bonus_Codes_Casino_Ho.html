<p>Poker continues to thrive with the new year bringing even more opportunities for talented and hopeful players to try their hand at some of the most competitive tables in the United States</p>
<p>This is mostly the courtesy of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) which has released its full summer schedule, offering a revamped list of events, and some of the biggest prize pools that have been seen to date.</p>
<p>WSOP Expects Big Things from the 2023 Main Event</p>
<p>Responding to an upsurging interest in the game across the country, WSOP has decided to invest more into its Main Event, which could feature the biggest prize pool in the organization’s history to date. This year’s poker bonanza will unfold between May 30 and July 18 and take place at the Horseshoe Las Vegas.</p>
<p>There will be a total of 95 bracelet events and the Main Event will be taking place on July 3 through July 17. Not only that, but one lucky participant will earn free entry into the next 30 Main Events. Overall, WSOP is bracing for what the organization has described as its biggest attendance yet.</p>
<p>This is thanks to a number of factors, not least the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, the pent-up demand for live poker, and not least – the continuously improving profile and popularity of the game in the United States, and beyond. Commenting on the upcoming events, WSOP SVP &amp; executive director Ty Stewart said:</p>
<p>With the momentum generated from the WSOP’s debut on the Las Vegas Strip last year, we expect a record-breaking WSOP and World Championship at Paris and Horseshoe Las Vegas in 2023. WSOP SVP &amp; executive director Ty Stewart</p>
<p>Record Guaranteed Entries Now Available</p>
<p>Stewart spared the Main Event no flattery, arguing that “this is the year” to go to Las Vegas and play. WSOP is definitely putting in a lot of effort to ensure that interest exceeds expectations, with 600 seats into the main event guaranteed through qualifications hosted by GGPoker, a prominent online poker website, and platform.</p>
<p>WSOP.com is also hosting additional series for another 112 guaranteed seats. Nevertheless, the bulk of entries comes from players who are more than happy to pay for the Main Event upfront and cover expenses associated with traveling and accommodation for a chance to take a shot at the multi-million prize pools. No details about what the prize pool for the Main Event would be is available right now.</p>
