<p>Georgia Lawmakers Hope to Bring Casinos, Horse Tracks to Peach State</p>

<p>Sen. Brandon Beach (R) filed a measure last week that would set up a Georgia Horse Racing Commission. Under Senate Bill 30, the commission could license up to three racetracks in Georgia.</p>
<p>Also last week, Rep. Ron Stephens (R) introduced a resolution to ask Georgia voters during the next election whether they want casinos in the state. That measure is House Resolution 30.</p>
<p>A constitutional amendment is required before casinos or horse tracks could begin operating in Georgia, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
<p>Constitutional amendments are difficult to achieve. They require a two-thirds vote in both legislative chambers and a majority vote in a public election.</p>
<p>In previous years, lawmakers at the Capitol in Atlanta have been unsuccessful in passing bills to expand gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents have argued that gambling leads to higher crime rates and thrusts families into economic hardship when money losses mount.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Bill</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Stephens introduced House Bill 86 to allow online sports betting in the state. Stephens is chairman of the House Tourism and Economic Development Committee.</p>
<p>Stephens has said sports betting does not require a constitutional amendment. This means the bill only would need a majority vote in each legislative chamber before going to the governor.</p>
<p>Under his bill, sports wagering would be managed by the Georgia Lottery, with proceeds benefitting the HOPE scholarship fund. The lottery was established in Georgia in 1992.</p>
<p>If approved, HB86 in its current form would require the companies providing sports betting services to pay a 16 percent tax on revenue.</p>
<p>The bill’s proponents say sport betting creates jobs and can improve education in the state by pumping money into the HOPE scholarship fund.</p>
<p>“We’re back at trying to backfill the HOPE scholarship and pre-k, and the destination resorts, along with the tourism piece, is the way to do it,” Stephens told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The capital city’s four professional sports teams have expressed support for online sport wagering. These are the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Hawks, and Atlanta United.</p>
<p>Southern States Seek Gaming Growth</p>
<p>In pushing sport betting legislation, Stephens has said more than $1 billion already is being spent on illegal sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>In addition, mobile sports betting became legal in Tennessee in November for anyone betting within the Volunteer State. Chattanooga, a southeastern Tennessee city on the Georgia border, is only two hours from Atlanta.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in other Southern states are looking at allowing online sports betting. These include Texas and Mississippi.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, legislators during the next session in April will decide whether to allow mobile sports betting or restrict it to in-person wagers placed at sportsbooks inside casinos. During the November election, voters in a majority of Louisiana parishes approved sports betting within their parish. With taxation and other issues unresolved, sports betting is not expected to be legal in Louisiana until at least 2022.</p>
