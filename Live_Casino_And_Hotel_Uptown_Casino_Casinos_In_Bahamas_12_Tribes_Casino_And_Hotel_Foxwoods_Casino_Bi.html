    <h1>Live Casino And Hotel Uptown Casino Casinos In Bahamas 12 Tribes Casino And Hotel Foxwoods Casino Bi</h1>

<p>The KYC for Wins Royal Casino has been pending for 12 days and is yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>(Documents have already been uploaded)</p>
<p>Also, every time I attempt a withdrawal, the transaction comes back with an error.</p>
<p>I asked the operator when the KYC would be completed, and was told it would take more time.</p>
<p>I am at a loss as there has been no progress. Could you possibly shed some light on this issue?</p>
<p>Furthermore, on this site's KYC application page, it is stated that the KYC won't be checked unless a withdrawal request is submitted.</p>
<p>Despite this, the withdrawal feature will not be available unless the KYC is completed.</p>
<p>I believe there to be a contradiction in this rule.</p>
<p>Could you help me resolve this issue?</p>
