<p>Fubo Sportsbook has officially launched in its third US sports betting market, New Jersey, having completed the soft launch of the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), Fubo Gaming announced.</p>
<p>‘Immersive Sports Wagering and Viewing Experience’</p>
<p>The launch of Fubo Sportsbook marks the first sportsbook in the state to integrate live TV streaming with wagering in one ecosystem, offering sports bettors in the Garden State a variety of wagers in time for the start of the 2022-23 football season, as well as thousands other live and future professional and collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>Hailing the launch in New Jersey as an “important early step in the development” of Fubo Gaming’s integrated platform, Fubo Gaming’s president Scott Butera focused on the opportunities the Garden State presents for the business.</p>
<p>“As one of the largest and most established sports betting markets in the U.S., New Jersey will allow Fubo to analyze and efficiently develop the most engaging product features that are focused on driving streaming customers into wagering,” Butera said, outlining that the state is known for its “deeply passionate sports fans,” expressing his strong belief that they will enjoy Fubo Sportsbook’s “one-of-a-kind immersive sports wagering and viewing experience.”</p>
<p>David Gandler, co-founder and chief executive officer of FuboTV, also commented on the launch, highlighting the company’s belief that “an integrated wagering platform offering both live video and a sportsbook” is the best gaming experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Gandler also noted that only ten months after Fubo Sportsbook’s first launch, the sportsbook is now live in three US states, while the team is “committed to interactive wagering and continue to explore” opportunities to expand into other states.</p>
<p>Fubo Gaming secured market access for its Fubo Sportsbook in New Jersey as part of an agreement with Caesars Entertainment signed in March 2021 which also involved market access in Indiana. In February this year, the partners expanded their agreement to include market access in Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri. In-between, Fubo Sportsbook went live in Iowa and Arizona.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Partnership with the Jets</p>
<p>The launch in New Jersey further strengthens Fubo Gaming’s presence in the state following the operator’s multi-year partnership with the New York Jets as the NFL franchise represents the NY/NJ metropolitan area and its stadium is located in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Following on the opening of Fubo’s 7,000-square-foot lounge at MetLife Stadium, the launch of Fubo Sportsbook will activate the mobile sports betting lounge during the 2022 football season, offering an unparalleled in-stadium experience by featuring a casino-style sportsbook integrated with betting odds, special bonuses and other incentives.</p>
<p>“With the official launch of Fubo Sportsbook in New Jersey, the Fubo Lounge and Fubo’s wagering app will provide an opportunity for our fans to responsibly gamble on sporting events from one of the best experiential settings in the NFL,” said Jeff Fernandez, vice president of business development and ventures for the New York Jets.</p>
