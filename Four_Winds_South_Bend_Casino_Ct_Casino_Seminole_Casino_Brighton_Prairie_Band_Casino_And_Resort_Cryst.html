    <h1>Four Winds South Bend Casino Ct Casino Seminole Casino Brighton Prairie Band Casino And Resort Cryst</h1>

<p>I self excluded with 4 crowns casino on 28/01/2020. I then opened an account with arescasino. Someone in their live chat confirmed it was a sister site of 4crowns casino and i told them my account was closed and they confirmed that was ok - i never told them it was self excluded.</p>
<p>I verified my account with exact details i verified my account at 4 crowns casino with.</p>
<p>Anyway, in my last deposit of £50 none of them games would load for me.</p>
<p>Some games that did load said i could not play in the UK.</p>
<p>Arescasino closed my account once i told them i was self excluded from 4 crowns casino.</p>
<p>I asked them to prove they have a licence in the UK and they ignored me.</p>
<p>I have requested all of my deposits back, total of £650 because i should not have been able to open an account with them due to self exclusion at 4 crowns casino and that i live in the UK.</p>
