<p>Kraken Deep Wins Slot Review</p>
<p>Kraken Deep Wins is a video slot by Nucleus Gaming, the provider of premium content that caters to all tastes with richly developed 3D cinematic themes and strong mathematical models. The 5×3 reel game released in 2020 is one of the 122 available games in the studio’s catalog and it invites players to prove their bravery and start exploring the sunken, hidden treasures in the sea packed with monsters and sharks.</p>
<p>With 20 pay lines and a plethora of features including respins, win multipliers and sticky wilds, the game has a lot to offer to players passionate about upbeat gameplay experiences with potentially lucrative rewards. If you are eager to take the plunge, check out the rest of our online slot review to find out more about the theme and storyline, paytable and symbols, bonus features, animations, soundtrack, and overall gameplay.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Dip Your Toes in and Awaken the Kraken</p>
<p>The storyline sends players into a fascinating undersea world where they need to explore the fascinating maritime creatures and hidden items ranging from the fearsome Kraken and sharks to bottles, treasure chests, boots, and, of course, the deep sea diver character.</p>
<p>The action is set in an age when science was in bloom while myths were still alive and kicking. Not a lot of software providers have embraced this theme over the years, which means that players getting ready to try the slot for the first time are likely to experience a novel game from many standpoints.</p>
<p>With free spins ready to be grabbed while going for a deep swim in the depths, facing the Kraken, the iconic sea monster huge in size that is said to appear off the coasts of Norway suddenly doesn’t sound like such a bad idea.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned galleon is clearly noticeable on one side of the grid while the deep sea diving suit is visible on the opposite side of the reels. As mentioned earlier, the action of the game is set in a time when explorers were freely charting the deepest and most dangerous parts of the world while controlled by a sense of danger. While admiring the mesmerizing oceanic backdrop and the smartly designed symbols, players will notice that the reels will appear to be floating above the water. The old sailing ship placed to the left and the diving bell placed to the right complement the nautical design chosen for the game. As players proceed to engage in the free spins round, they are gradually descended into the depth of the sea where the Kraken is lurking and waiting for them.</p>
<p>The reels also feature an interesting plethora of playing cards that appear to be made of wood, a hidden message in a bottle, and even a Victorian-style diving helmet. The angry-looking red octopus is, of course, the star of the show, carefully guarding its territory against divers looking to get their hands on its treasures.</p>
<p>Kraken Deep Wins: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game features a minimum stake set at 0.20, which makes it attractive for players looking to start with small wagers. The maximum bet set at 20, however, is not high enough for high rollers. To score a win, players must land between three and five of the available symbols, resulting in different payout values. For example, matching five diving suit symbols on the pay lines will trigger a top payout of x60 while the same number of Kraken symbols will trigger a win of x24. For five identical treasure chest symbols, players engage a payout of x16 whereas five bottles bring players x12. Similar payouts are offered for five boots and shark symbols. Half of that is rewarded for landing five As and Ks, whereas five Qs or Js will only trigger an x4 payout.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animations are nicely designed, with the Kraken monster seen wrapping its tentacles around the winning symbols on the grid or the wild symbols seen sitting inside a spinning whirlpool. The soundtrack and sound effects also complement the theme and they remind of Pirates of the Caribbean tunes heard playing out while the reels are spinning. All in all, the music nicely incorporates the exciting and dangerous elements of maritime exploration.</p>
<p>Kraken Deep Wins Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and easy to control. Players can click the “i” tab to the left of the grid and get access to the autoplay setting, paytable, rules, and game settings, including background music, sound effects, and Turbo play mode. The sound effects can also be easily adjusted using the speaker icon to the bottom left.</p>
<p>Using the bet bar, players will know exactly their current stake and change it with the help of dedicated sliders. The Autospin function can be engaged at the far right and it enables players to set a specific number of automatic spins with limits on their balance. The game is played on 20 fixed pay lines that cannot be adjusted and the highest win per line ways. The game paid left to right</p>
<p>Kraken Deep Wins: The Kraken’s Stick and Respin, Anchored Wild Boost, Anchored Wilds &amp; Diving Bell Free Spins</p>
<p>The game features a series of exciting bonus features:</p>
<p>The Kraken’s Stick and Respin. This feature is a rare occurrence with most of the online slots we have tested over the years. All unsuccessful spins give players the chance to potentially enjoy a free respin. When this occurs, the random symbol will turn into a sticky symbol, thus boosting the odds of creating a winning combination. At the same time, the reels will continue to spin until players will finally hit a win. The feature cannot be triggered provided sticky anchored wilds are seen on the reels.</p>
<p>Anchored Wild Boost. This feature can be activated by any spin that generates a win. The feature brings players one free respin without also guaranteeing a win. Once the feature is engaged, players will notice the border of the reels lighting up. The odds for the anchored wilds to be seen on the reels is also higher while the feature is active. Between five and seven wilds are placed on the reels. The anchored wilds are non-sticky. Any free spins given to players prior to the feature will take place once the feature will be completed.</p>
<p>Anchored Wilds. These symbols replace any symbol with the expectation of the diving bell. Scatter symbols can occur in place of the sticky wilds. The anchored wilds are sticky for the duration of two spins. Anchored wild can only pop up on the second, third, fourth, and fifth reels.</p>
<p>Diving Bell Free Spins. The free spins are played at the bet of the spin that has triggered them. The diving bell also plays the role of a scatter. The Free Spins mode occurs on an additional screen provided the Kraken’s Stick &amp; Respin feature or the Anchored Wild Boost respin feature is engaged at the same time as the free spins are completed.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With relatively small, but frequent wins possible, a highly entertaining undersea world theme with a Kraken monster at the center, and excellent bonus features to round players’ payouts, Kraken Deep Wins is a good option from Nucleus Gaming.</p>
