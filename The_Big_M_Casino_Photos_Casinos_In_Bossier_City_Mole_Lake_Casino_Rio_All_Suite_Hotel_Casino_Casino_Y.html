    <h1>The Big M Casino Photos Casinos In Bossier City Mole Lake Casino Rio All Suite Hotel Casino Casino Y</h1>

<p>Hello, unfortunately I don't have any exact dates, but I don't know what to do anymore. After I gambled away 15k one night at Platincasino, I speared myself and went to therapy, especially because of Platincasino. Well, after a relapse of about a few months, I registered again with Platin and paid in 200 euros again, well I saw player reports that Platin does not pay out in the event of a win and I also referred to it and after a long discussion got at least the 200 euros back, RIGHTLY BECAUSE player protection was not complied with was well so far so good I let another month pass this time played by a friend on his account but again paid in via my paysafe credit this time several thousand I read their terms and conditions that if I pay in with my paysafe account under a different name (in in my friend's case) all winnings will be canceled upon withdrawal and deposit will be refunded all right.</p>
<p>I write platinum on it as I said I was highly addicted to gambling. Player protection not taken again over my name which has already been banned 2 x at said casino paid in several thousand lost support for weeks back and forth. Her discussed that I even hoped for dad money made in the end very outrageously only automated answers mgma not written back to this day.</p>
<p>"Online Lawyer" (I'm totally broke) is still checking the case.</p>
<p>Have. Me on player protection and. Terms and conditions called and not even ignored. A comparison would be offered to me.</p>
<p>Gamblejoe, can't you help me legally</p>
<p>Deposits into the player's account can be made using the payment methods available on the Red Rhino website. The name of the payment method holder (credit card, bank account or ePayment) must match that of the player account holder. If this is not the case, the corresponding amount will be returned to the payer and the deposit will be refused. Any fees incurred will be charged to the paying account.</p>
<p>PLUS I AM. DOUBLED AND THESE PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY PLATINUM KNOW ABOUT MY GAMING ADDICTION...</p>
<p>I've been struggling for months waiting for answers from mgma. Or a lawyer but well I'm just a small fish but I'll go to the end Platinum is really mafia I think wje can please set the terms and conditions as you want I would have won if they had referred to payment transactions ยง3 Section 1 so now the opposite is the Case PLUS. I WAS OR I AM REALLY GAMBLING SICK. AND BLOCKED EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>AND this casino I always win my casinos but to make money from sick people who even took security measures on their side that didn't help at all that's hard and now I want to know again why I don't get my money back if I was first of all blocked to a high degree with you and secondly. I had never been able to win anything and then I didn't even suggest a comparison. People casinoguru how can something like that be advertised?</p>
<p>But tz German taxes take very heavy nr. per spin.</p>
<p>So casinoguru everything is true to the word please help. Me. Legally dad is self-propelled look. What said casino now answers best Sebastian has documented most of it with date etc</p>
