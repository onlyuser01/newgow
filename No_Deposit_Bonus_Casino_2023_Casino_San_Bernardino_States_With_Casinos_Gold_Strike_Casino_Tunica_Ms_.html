    <h1>No Deposit Bonus Casino 2023 Casino San Bernardino States With Casinos Gold Strike Casino Tunica Ms</h1>

<p>I signed up to this casino on 26 Sep and had my ID and residency fully verified within 24 hours. Played all sorts of games from several providers, made 9 deposits and 1 withdrawal, no barriers or problems. Then only FIVE DAYS after i signed up, i logged in fine but for every game I loaded it suddenly said "country blocked". These were all games I had been playing fine all week, and I checked the Terms again and it still did not say UK was restricted. I had not used a VPN or tried to disguise my residency in any way, everything was the same, just suddenly "country blockrd" on every game provider (though i could still log in to my account).</p>
<p>I queried it with their customer service and 2 days later they replied saying they have decided to withdraw from the UK market. I don't see how they can do this with no warning. It looks to me as if they realised they should not be letting UK players in for whatever reason but to me that is an admission that I should not have been allowed to play those games in the first place.</p>
<p>I still have money in my account, not much, and too little to qualify for tyeir 100 euro minimum withdrawal, but its the principle, they can't just confiscate it surely? And in fact one of the games I was playing a lot (Royal Mint) is a "collect tokens" game which stores value until you collect enough and trigger a special bonus, I was halfway through the collection process and now cannot get that value.</p>
<p>Please could you point out to them that if they have realised they cannot accept UK players then they need to compensate those of us who signed up in good faith, and put money in to what are maybe not even legal games (?).</p>
