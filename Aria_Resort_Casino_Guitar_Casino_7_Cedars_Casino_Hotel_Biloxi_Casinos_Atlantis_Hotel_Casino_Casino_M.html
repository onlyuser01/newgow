    <h1>Aria Resort Casino Guitar Casino 7 Cedars Casino Hotel Biloxi Casinos Atlantis Hotel Casino Casino M</h1>

<p>I did not recieve those e-mails. Its fine that they sent a screenshot with a vlosed eye as a proof that I saw their e-mail, but its simply not the truth.</p>
<p>I can easily show a screenshot of my inbox showing, that I did not recieve those mails. If you look in the chat-log, I told the chat-operator that over and over again, but was completely ignorred; the only thing working for her was to reply to a mail, that I did not get. If she could see that I have read thise e-mails, then why did she not tell me that, when I was chatting with her? Not ONE time did she mention that.</p>
<p>Why should I lie about it, when the only thing I wanted in that moment, was to get a limit set? It makes no sence.</p>
<p>Also, according to their terms; they do not write anything about customers have to reply to a mail to get a limit set. When i talked with the operator he never mention that I could just sent them a mail to get the limit set… the only thing that would work was to reply to one of her mails; mails that I did not have any possibilities to answer.</p>
<p>As you can see in the e-mail communication I had with them lately, I asked multiply times, why they could not do an exception, when it all was about responsible gambling. Their reply was… we have internal rules, that forbid ud to set limits without the customers reply to a mail. In my eyes such internal rules, that are not mention in their terms, does not follow the codex of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>According to your quistion about blocking my account, they told me to sent a mail with some informations after I had lost the money. The deposit limit was still not set at that time. What I dont understand is; why can I easily close an account with senting an e-mail to them, when it was not the case, when I wanted to set a deposit limit? It makes no sence.</p>
