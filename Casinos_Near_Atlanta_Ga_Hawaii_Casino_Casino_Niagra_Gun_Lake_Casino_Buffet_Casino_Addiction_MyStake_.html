    <h1>Casinos Near Atlanta Ga Hawaii Casino Casino Niagra Gun Lake Casino Buffet Casino Addiction MyStake</h1>

<p>Hi, I would like to note that I am waiting for the casino to reply to two different emails:</p>
<p>"Buenos dias,</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer, but this does not solve my case. I accept this clause and if I decide to continue playing in your casino I will change the password for security.</p>
<p>What I ask is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access history between 00:00 am and 09:00 am on February 8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank accounts where my money was sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In case I do not have the above, I am sorry again, but the case will be reported to the consumer office in my country and will be dealt with personally with the means at my access.</p>
<p>I understand that for you it is just another case, but this insecurity created in a single day of play I cannot allow it.</p>
<p>I await your reply.</p>
<p>Regards."</p>
<p>"Buenos dias,</p>
<p>To follow up on the case, my bank has replied to my first query about the denied transaction. This was their reply:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. G***:</p>
<p>We reply to your letter, which was entered in this Claims and Customer Service with the registration number indicated above, in which you express your discomfort at not seeing a transfer that should have been issued reflected in your account.</p>

Therefore, we ask that, in order to attend to your request, you send us more details about the operation, providing documentation proving that it was sent by the issuer, including information such as the operation reference, date and amount that allows us to locate it, in In the case of an international transfer, you must provide us with the Swift issued by the ordering bank as well as any other additional information.</p>
<p>Without another particular, we take advantage of the opportunity to greet you very attentively."</p>
<p>I therefore ask you to give me the information I am asked for: supporting documentation from the sender, including information such as the reference of the transaction, date and amount that allows us to locate it, in the case of an international transfer, it must provided with the Swift issued by the ordering bank as well as any other additional information.</p>
