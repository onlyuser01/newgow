<p>The announcement came on Super Bowl Sunday, with the band revealing that the shows will take place this fall</p>
<p>After much speculation, U2 has finally confirmed that they will perform shows dedicated to their iconic album Achtung Baby at Las Vegas’ new globe-shaped venue, MSG Sphere.</p>
<p>U2 Announces Highly Anticipated Shows at MSG Sphere with Mysterious UFO-Themed Ad</p>
<p>The Irish rockers had previously hinted at the shows before the Super Bowl, posting an image of a newborn baby within the newly constructed MSG Sphere on a website called U2xsphere.com. The official announcement came with a mysterious UFO-themed ad for the ‘U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at the Sphere’ shows.</p>
<p>The announcement of U2’s shows at MSG Sphere has been highly anticipated since rumors first began to circulate last year. While the pandemic delayed the venue’s opening until 2023, the wait will undoubtedly be worth it for U2’s fans. The band’s last US concert was in July 2018, and they have not played together on stage since December 2019 when their Joshua Tree anniversary tour ended in Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>In a statement published on the band’s website, U2 members said that the Sphere show had been in the works for a long time, and they did not want to let people down, least of all their audience. They also admitted that they missed their audience and that their fans were always the fifth member of the band.</p>
<p>The Sphere shows will mark U2’s first-ever concerts without drummer Larry Mullen Jr., who will sit out due to a reported neck surgery. Bram van den Berg will fill in for Mullen at the Sphere concerts.</p>
<p>Despite Mullen’s absence from the Sphere shows, the band remains confident that they will deliver a memorable performance. “It’s going to take all we’ve got to approach the Sphere without our bandmate in the drum seat, but Larry has joined us in welcoming Bram van den Berg who is a force in his own right,” said Bono, The Edge, and Adam Clayton in the statement on their website.</p>
<p>U2 Prepares to Deliver Next-Level Live Experience with MSG Sphere’s Unmatched Technology</p>
<p>U2 has always been known for pushing the boundaries of live performances, incorporating the latest technology and innovation into their shows. The Sphere’s state-of-the-art audio and visual experience, including 580,000 square feet of programmable LED panels, will provide the perfect backdrop for the band to take their live experience of music to the next level. When completed, the 388-foot-tall venue will hold between 17,500 and 20,000 people.</p>
<p>According to The Edge, the Sphere is not just a venue for U2, but rather a canvas of unparalleled scale and image resolution that provides endless possibilities for immersive experiences in real and imaginary landscapes. He explained that it was a unique opportunity that only came once in a generation, and after careful consideration, they would be crazy not to accept the invitation.</p>
<p>U2’s dedication to pushing the boundaries of live performance is likely to make the Sphere shows an event that music enthusiasts and fans would not want to miss.</p>
