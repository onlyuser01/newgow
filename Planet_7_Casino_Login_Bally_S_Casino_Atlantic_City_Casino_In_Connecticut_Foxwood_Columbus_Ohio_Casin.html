<p>William Hill, a leading iGaming and sports betting brand, has rolled out its newest game, Mines, which has been crafted with Hacksaw Gaming, a prominent studio and developer of games.</p>
<p>This is a new bespoke product part of the Dare2Win vertical coined by Hacksaw Gaming, an ambitious portfolio that is recreating arcade and traditional gaming titles and bringing them to the online casino experience. Mines is part of a three-game series, Hacksaw Gaming says, which already includes Coins and Boxes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new game offers William Hill the opportunity to deliver an experience that will carry its own branding and raise its profile with audiences. The William Hill-branded Mines draws on the familiar traditional game whereby players try to collect Diamond symbols while avoiding the Bomb symbol.</p>
<p>For each Diamond symbol revealed, the potential payout will increase, granting players even more opportunities to win and William Hill, in turn, with a stronger retention and engagement tool across the board. The game itself comes in various betting limits and is fit for any bankroll, making it a truly flexible product.</p>
<p>William Hill Global Gaming Content Delivery Manager Keiron Downs said the company was really excited to embark on this "alternative gaming experience" and bring it to William Hill’s customer bases.</p>
<p>William Hill was involved in the designing process and called it flawless, and the company was ultimately extremely happy with how the final product turned out. The brand will be keeping a close eye on how the game is received and how it performs over the next months with other similar collaborations possibly on the cards.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming CCO Gabrielle Star was similarly pleased with the opportunity to celebrate the company’s partnership with William Hill by developing a brand new product that is tailored to the needs of William Hill and its gaming audiences.</p>
<p>"Our designers did a brilliant job incorporating William Hill’s iconic branding into the game, offering a more straightforward vintage style of gameplay which has entertained casino fans for decades," said Star, adding that the Dare2Win vertical is one that holds immense overall potential.</p>
