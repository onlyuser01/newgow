<p>The supplier of Setka Cup table tennis tournament and ESportsBattle eFootball will now help Digitain boost its own content footprint</p>
<p>BETER is a company that has been building a robust footprint in the sports betting, esports, and iGaming verticals through the provision of next-gen content that will now strengthen Digitain‘s offering, which is touted as one of the best platform providers for the aforementioned verticals in the industry.</p>
<p>BETER Offers Digitain a Boost in Esports and Sports</p>
<p>Together, the two partners will seek to deploy BETER’s ESportsBattle tournaments with more people. The partnership will also cover Setka Cup table tennis tournaments and generally give the two companies another strong chance to grow their respective footprints.</p>
<p>Setka Cup runs round-the-clock tennis competitions that people can bet on, while BETER uses the ESportsBattle product to introduce betting opportunities to video gaming fans for games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and eHockey, eBasketball, and eFootball. Commenting on this new opportunity, BETER CRO Chuck Robinson said:</p>
<p>Our esports and sports offering is taking the whole betting space by storm and really does set the standard for other betting products on the market to follow. BETER CRO Chuck Robinson</p>
<p>Robinson welcomed the opportunity to be working with industry-leading companies such as Digitain and said that he felt confident in what the future of the partnership would bring. The executive was confident in the quality of the products that BETER brings to the fore as well.</p>
<p>Digitain CRO Iain Hutchison was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this partnership take shape and introduce its own partner operators and their players with engaging and immersive products. BETER gives Digitain a cutting-edge advantage in both the sports and esports verticals, Hutchison said.</p>
<p>Digitain and BETER Confident in the Success of Partnership</p>
<p>“Its ESportsBattle and Setka Cup brands are unrivalled and integrating it into our platform will ensure Digitain is at the forefront of delivering esports and sports betting content to our growing 150+ partner operator brands globally,” Hutchison concluded.</p>
<p>BETER recently made improvements to its basketball products with the BSKT CUP tournament featuring live streaming, data, and odds. BETER also signed a partnership in May with BetConstruct to help run 24/7 esports and sports content.</p>
