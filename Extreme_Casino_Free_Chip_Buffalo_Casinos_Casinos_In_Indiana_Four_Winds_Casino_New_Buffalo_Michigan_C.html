    <h1>Extreme Casino Free Chip Buffalo Casinos Casinos In Indiana Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Michigan C</h1>

<p>Boom Entertainment, a provider of online gaming content and platform solutions, announced today that it has entered into a multi-faceted deal with Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) to offer the gaming brand its portfolio of products and services.</p>
<p>‘Unrivaled Gaming Product’</p>
<p>The comprehensive deal with the content supplier formerly known as Boom Sports will give GNOG access to Boom’s casino game library, remote game server, market access in Ohio and sports betting and free-to-play games.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to enter this long-term relationship with Boom. Boom’s team has an impressive track record in the gaming industry, and we believe this partnership will help GNOG continue to differentiate itself in the market with a premier, unrivaled gaming product.” Thomas Winter, President, GNOG</p>
<p>GNOG, which, much like Rush Street Interactive, became a minority investor in Boom after the content supplier’s recent round of financing, will also receive a library of custom games exclusively built for the online gaming arm of Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>We are excited to work with an incredible operator in Golden Nugget. Boom’s mission is to fuel the biggest winners in sports betting and casino gaming, whether they are operators, leagues, retail establishments, or media companies. We are excited to add our mark to Golden Nugget’s award-winning product.” Stephen A. Murphy, CEO, Boom Entertainment</p>
<p>The multi-faceted agreement includes an integration of Boom’s remote gaming server and portfolio of high-end online casino games into GNOG’s offering, as well as several custom online casino titles. Additionally, the deal will allow GNOG to benefit from Boom’s other assets and capabilities such as free-to-play gaming, sports betting-related content, online casino technology and market access rights.</p>
<p>Pending RGS and Casino Games Launch</p>
<p>Seeking to establish itself as a premier provider of online games and technology, Boom is gradually gaining popularity among sports fans after more than three million of them experienced the company’s products in the past two years.</p>
<p>In preparation of its RGS and real-money casino games for casino operators launch expected to come in the next few months, Boom appointed Chris Fargis as general manager of Sports Betting Products to bring onboard bags of experience, including in product and operation leadership roles at DraftKings.</p>
<p>DraftKings was also involved with the latest news related to GNOG after the Boston-based daily fantasy and sportsbook brand entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the online gaming arm of GNOG in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.56 billion that is expected to bring multi-million synergies and strategic benefits.</p>
