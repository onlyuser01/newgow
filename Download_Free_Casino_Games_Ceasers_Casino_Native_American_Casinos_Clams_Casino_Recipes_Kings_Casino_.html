<p>The sports betting handle and revenue in Rhode Island continued to climb up last month, data released by the gambling regulator reveals.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Revenue Soars, Handle Increases Slightly</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in the state, the Rhode Island Lottery, has announced the latest data for the performance of mobile and land-based licensed sports betting operators in September. The revenue reported by sportsbook operators in August surpassed $3 million for the first time since March. Now, in September, the combined revenue reported by the land-based sportsbooks and mobile operations hit $6,361,823, more than double what was reported a month earlier, in August. A year-over-year comparison shows that revenue this September soared considering that in September last year, it halted at $4 million. What’s more, the $6.4 million result this September marked the second-highest revenue reported in Rhode Island, surpassed only by the $6.7 million result from November 2021.</p>
<p>The increase in revenue was positively impacted by a higher betting handle. Overall, the combined betting handle by sportsbooks in Rhode Island in September hit $41,670,257. This marked a significant increase when compared to the $27.7 million result reported a month earlier, in August. However, the $41.7 million in betting handle reported this September marked a slight increase when compared to the $41.2 million reported during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Mobile Betting Gets Lion’s Cut of Revenue</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in the state unveiled a breakdown of the $6.4 million in betting revenue reported this September. Not unexpectedly, the bigger part of the revenue was reported by mobile sports wagering operations. In total, mobile betting revenue last month hit $3.6 million. When compared to the $1.6 million in mobile betting revenue reported in August, the result from September marked an increase of nearly 124%.</p>
<p>Despite mobile betting reporting most of the revenue last month, the two retail locations, Twin River and Tiverton Casino also saw an increase in revenue. The Twin River venue reported $9.9 million in betting handle last month, which translated to $1,597,193 in revenue. When compared to the $866,413 in revenue reported a month earlier, in August, the result from September marked an increase of 84.3%. Additionally, the result from September slightly surpassed the $1,349,600 in revenue reported in September last year.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tiverton Casino’s sports betting handle increased in September to $4,943,538. This brought $1,117,254 in revenue for September for the gambling venue. This result completely surpassed the $504,225 reported in revenue a month earlier, in August. A year-over-year comparison also showed that Tiverton Casino’s sports betting revenue increased by nearly 89%, considering that in September 2021, it halted at $591,239.</p>
