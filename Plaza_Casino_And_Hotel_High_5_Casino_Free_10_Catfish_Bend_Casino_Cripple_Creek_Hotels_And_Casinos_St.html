<p>Booming Games will inject five of its top performers into TonyBet’s platform and will add more games at a later date</p>
<p>Booming Games, a developer of iGaming content whose popularity is booming, has entered Spain through a new partnership with TonyBet. The latter company is a prominent operator that will adopt some of the provider’s best games.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Booming Games will inject five of its top performers into TonyBet’s platform. This will notably include the famous games Megahops Megaways, Buffalo Hold and Win, Cash Pig, The Wild Wings of Phoenix and Crack the Bank Hold and Win.</p>
<p>As a result, TonyBet’s numerous players will now get to experience the amazing gameplay the developer is famous for. However, this is not all as more Booming Games titles are scheduled to be added to TonyBet at a later date.</p>
<p>The partnership marks Booming Games’ foray into the lucrative Spanish market. Spain is a very strict market but also a very promising one, especially for companies committed to following the rules. TonyBet is a regional powerhouse that is sure to popularize Booming Games’ content in the region.</p>
<p>The launch is also in line with Booming Games’ ongoing expansion efforts that have seen the company launch iGaming content in multiple key markets. These efforts recently saw the developer expand its presence in Latin America through a deal with Rivalo.</p>
<p>Spanish Customers Are Going to Love the Games, Davis Skulte Says</p>
<p>Booming Games’ chief commercial officer, Frederik Niehusen, commented on the new agreement, lauding TonyBet as a company that is “at the forefront of the gambling industry.” The partnership with such a high-profile company, therefore, was described as a “momentous achievement” for Booming Games.</p>
<p>TonyBet sets itself apart by providing the safest, fairest, and most trusted online betting environment for players worldwide. This partnership will greatly strengthen our presence in the Spanish market. Frederik Niehusen, CCO, Booming Games</p>
<p>Davis Skulte, TonyBet’s key account manager, welcomed Booming Games to the TonyBet family. He praised the developer for its refreshing and diverse titles, saying that he is certain Spanish players are going to love them.</p>
<p>We have full confidence that their offerings will meet the needs of our players. We eagerly anticipate the development and prosperity of this partnership, which we believe will benefit both parties. Davis Skulte, key account manager, TonyBet</p>
<p>TonyBet is bullish on expanding the offering of its European brands. In February, the company also integrated Greentube content into its Latvian portfolio.</p>
<p>The operator also faced some difficulties in the UK where it was hit with a huge $550,000 fine over regulation breaches.</p>
