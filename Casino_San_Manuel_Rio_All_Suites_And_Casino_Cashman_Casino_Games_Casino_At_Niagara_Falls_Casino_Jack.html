<p>The Baltimore Ravens are locked in a battle for the no.1 spot in the AFC North Division with the Cincinnati Bengals. Both are currently 9-4, and with just four more game weeks left in the 2022 NFL regular season, every game can prove crucial. This goes especially for divisional games such as the Baltimore Ravens vs Cleveland Browns game that’s taking place this Saturday in Ohio.</p>
<p>The Browns are favored by the bookies, which is no surprise given the fact that so many things are going in their favor ahead of Week 15. First of all, they got a new quarterback – Deshaun Watson – whose suspension ended two weeks ago. They also have the motivation to win as it would get them back in the race for a Wild Card entry to the postseason.</p>
<p>The final reason why the Browns are favored is that their opponents in Week 15 might end up playing with a third-string quarterback. However, there are some rumors suggesting that Lamar Jackson might be ready for Saturday’s game. With him as their signal caller, the Ravens defeated the Browns in their first game of the 2022 season.</p>

<p>Huge QB Headaches for the Ravens</p>
<p>The Ravens defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 16-14 last Sunday in their first game of the season in which Lamar Jackson didn’t start. Backup Tyler Huntley was given the QB role in that game, but he had to leave the field after picking up an injury in the third quarter.</p>
<p>As a result, Baltimore’s rookie quarterback Anthony Brown might be the one to get to start the Week 15 game. Rumor has it that Jackson still isn’t ready to come back – he missed the practice on Tuesday – but John Harbaugh might still decide to put him on the pitch as Saturday’s game is very important for the Ravens.</p>
<p>Still, the big question is whether unfit Jackson can produce much against the Browns, who are now way stronger than they were in the first Ravens vs Browns duel of the season.</p>
<p>Browns Plotting Revenge for the Loss in October</p>
<p>The Browns lost to the Ravens in Week 7 with the final score being 23-20 for the team from Baltimore. What’s interesting is that the Browns had a chance to equalize with a field goal in the final moments of the game, but Cade York failed to win three points for his team. His attempt was blocked by the Ravens linebacker Malik Harrison who stopped the game from going to overtime.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s offense did very well rushing-wise in that game, with running backs Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt scoring their two touchdowns. Two months later, the Browns are expected to do much better with their passing game. The reason? Deshaun Watson is going to be in the QB role on Saturday.</p>
<p>Since his suspension ended, he’s played twice as the starting QB for the Browns, throwing for a total of 407 yards and one touchdown. He sure can do much better than that and we might see him improve his stats in Week 15.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs Cleveland Browns Prediction</p>
<p>In the remainder of the regular season, the Ravens will get to play against each of their three divisional rivals. That said, losing to the Browns in Week 15 wouldn’t necessarily mean the end of the world for that.</p>
<p>What would, however, mean huge problems for Baltimore is if Lamar Jackson’s injury worsened. That’s why we think coach Harbaugh might decide to keep him sidelined on Saturday. Sure, this would probably mean losing to the Browns, but it would also mean Jackson’s gonna be 100% in the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>Picks: Cleveland Browns to win and cover the spread</p>
