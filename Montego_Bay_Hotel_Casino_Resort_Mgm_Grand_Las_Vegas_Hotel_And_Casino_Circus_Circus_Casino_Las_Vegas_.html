<p>The Palms Las Vegas website is currently down. The casino resort’s information technology (IT) department is investigating the cause.</p>

<p>A visit to www.palms.com currently redirects to a malware message warning visitors that clicking through to the website may harm the user’s computer.</p>
<p>“Warning — visiting this web site may harm your computer!” the landing page cautions.</p>
<p>The website suggests that visitors return to the previous page or try another search. Reached for comment by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Palms officials said the situation is under review.</p>
<p>We are aware of the disruptions to the Palms Casino website and are working as quickly as possible to determine the cause,” a Palms spokesperson said yesterday. “We’ve engaged outside experts to help us investigate the cause and restore availability to all users as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Palms Las Vegas website remained down as of 1:30 pm ET on Wednesday, October 19.</p>
<p>Malware Disruptions</p>
<p>Casinos have become prime targets for hackers and ransomware in recent years. Both commercial and tribal gaming businesses have been hit by online criminal groups.</p>
<p>The Palms situation is apparently a malware attack. Google labels the Palms website with a “Malware Warning.”</p>
<p>Malware is software intentionally designed to disrupt a computer, server, client, or network. Malware also typically involves the unauthorized access of private information and data. Palms hasn’t said whether its website issue has resulted in any confidential data being wrongly accessed.</p>
<p>The FBI last year warned Native American tribes that operate casinos to be on the lookout for ransomware attacks. A ransomware attack typically involves data breaches and blocking a company’s access to its digital properties until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>California’s San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, one of the nation’s richest gaming tribes, acquired the Palms last year from Red Rock Resorts and Station Casinos for $650 million. The tribe’s flagship property is the Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino at San Manuel in Highland, Calif.</p>
<p>Tribe Invests in Cybersecurity</p>
<p>The San Manuel Tribe has its own chief information security officer. The position is held by Glenn Wilson, a former software engineer who, for over the past 20 years, has worked in cybersecurity and data protection.</p>
<p>During last month’s TribalNet Conference 2022 at Reno’s Grand Sierra Resort &amp; Casino, Wilson stressed the importance of tribal casinos assuring the protection of their digital assets. He also discussed how easily hackers can access supposed protected materials.</p>
<p>When you hear someone say, ‘We’ve been the victim of a very sophisticated cyberattack,’ it really means that some fool clicked on an email they shouldn’t have,” Wilson said of common phishing emails.</p>
<p>Wilson recommends that casinos and any other business define three critical points when it comes to their cybersecurity protocols:</p>
<p>What do I have of value?</p>
<p>Who wants to steal it?</p>
<p>How should I protect it?</p>
<p>Wilson also says businesses must not take a “one and done” cybersecurity approach, and instead, continually upgrade and improve their online safeguards. But even the most advanced tech giants aren’t fully immune to cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Google admitted to paying an $8.7 million bounty to cybercriminals last year after its Android, Chrome, and Play platforms and systems were disrupted.</p>
