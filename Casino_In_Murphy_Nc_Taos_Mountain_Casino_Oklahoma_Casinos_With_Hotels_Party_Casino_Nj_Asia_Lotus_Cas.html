    <h1>Casino In Murphy Nc Taos Mountain Casino Oklahoma Casinos With Hotels Party Casino Nj Asia Lotus Cas</h1>

<p>As an IPhone user and a bit up in age the location of the max bet button and it’s relatively small font makes it difficult to quickly see if it has been activated until you loose several hundreds of your winnings.</p>
<p>There have been times I was absolutely certain I used caution to constantly make sure before I press the spin. Especially after it happened twice already.</p>
<p>I immediately, went to the chat to bring the issue to the attention of the casino, and see if there was any way to disable the max bet button because of its close proximity to the spin button. To no avail I was only asked to be more cautious before placing a bet. Now my dilemma it happened again today almost all of my bonus points were fulfilled. I noticed that I had won $3000 on one spin I immediately left The game went to the homepage, looked at my history. Text screenshots, then returned to the same game, which should have been reset back to five dollars which is normal gameplay. push the spin button lo and behold. It was still set on max bet. That one is on me because I was under the understanding because of our prior betting habits and amount of play with this game it has always gone back to the default game, bet.</p>
<p>As I said, this has happened a few times but I lost each time but my observations were that my holdings were over $2000 in my account each time. Coincidence? Or stupid fat finger play. Anyone else having issue with this location of the max bet button or being accessed when your Account is over a certain amount? They can see that I’m usually mostly a five dollar max bet 10 on occasion rare occasion bet player.</p>
<p>Thanks Kristine</p>
