<p>Circa and FullTime Fantasy are partnering on the Fantasy Football World Championships and the Las Vegas Fantasy Championships. Those competitions will bear the Circa brand.</p>
<p>These branded full season long drafts will be hosted online and live at the Circa Resort &amp; Casino,” according to a statement. “The live Circa Draft Series begins on August 17 and will run through opening weekend, with drafts taking place at Legacy Club Rooftop Cocktails, inside The owner’s suite at Stadium Swim, top-of-the-line Luxury suites, and other unique spaces within the property.”</p>
<p>The Circa Draft Series kicks off a week before the operator’s “Ultimate Contest Weekend,” geared toward the famed Circa Million and Circa Survivor football contests.</p>
<p>The 2023 iteration of the event kicks off on Thursday, August 24, and runs through Saturday, August 26. Circa’s Ultimate Contest Weekend will include events at the operator’s eponymous venue in downtown Las Vegas, as well as at the D. Participants in the contests are eligible for free rooms at Circa, the D, and the Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino, all of which are owned by Circa boss Derek Stevens.</p>
<p>Circa Logical Destination for Big Time Fantasy Football</p>
<p>Circa Sportsbook is widely viewed as one of the crown jewels among Las Vegas sportsbooks, making the property an ideal venue for high-level fantasy football competitions.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the agreement with FullTime Fantasy Sports weren’t revealed, but there are potential benefits for both parties. It’s estimated that more than 60 million Americans participate in fantasy sports, of which football is by far the most popular, and which is often cited as a catalyst for the recent growth in the NFL’s advertising revenue and television ratings.</p>
<p>Likewise, football is the most wagered-on sport in the U.S., and many fantasy football “aces” apply similar analytics and methodology to wagering on the sport.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, the aforementioned Las Vegas Championship features a grand prize of $50K and $2,500 league prizes, while the Fantasy Football World Championships offers a $150K grand prize and league prizes of $12K. Entry fees for the contests are $349 and $1,850, respectively.</p>
<p>Fantasy Football Insights</p>
<p>FullTime Fantasy, originally known as FF Toolbox, has been in the fantasy sports analytics and data business for more than two decades, making it a preferred choice for seasoned fantasy players and novices alike.</p>
<p>For those looking to prepare for the aforementioned Circa contests and the 2023 fantasy football campaign at large, positions of emphasis should be wide receivers and running backs. By many accounts, 19 of the top 20 projected fantasy players for the upcoming season play those positions.</p>
<p>As for quarterbacks, the trio of Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, and Patrick Mahomes are seen as the preferred options, according to fantasy experts.</p>
