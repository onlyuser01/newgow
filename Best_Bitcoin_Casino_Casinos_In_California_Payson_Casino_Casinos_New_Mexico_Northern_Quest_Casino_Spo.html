<p>NFL Draft Round One Betting Recap, Cleveland Browns Roll Dice With Baker Mayfield</p>

<p>No story on day one of the NFL Draft was more surprising than the Cleveland Browns rolling the dice on Baker Mayfield and selecting the Oklahoma Sooner quarterback as the number one pick of 2018.</p>

<p>USC quarterback Sam Darnold was seen as the consensus favorite last month, with sportsbooks listing him around 2/1 to 3/1 to go first. Mayfield, the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner who caused some controversy last season for crude antics during a game against Kansas, wasn’t even in the top five.</p>
<p>After Darnold, oddsmakers liked Penn State running back Saquon Barkley, then Wyoming QB Josh Allen, UCLA QB Josh Rosen, and NC defensive end State Bradley Chubb rounding out the top five.</p>
<p>Internet sportsbook BetOnline had Mayfield as long as +3300 earlier this month. A $100 bet on the Sooner star going first on those odds nets the fortunate gambler $3,300 today.</p>
<p>The line severely shrunk on news that the Browns were likely to take Mayfield first, but not before numerous ticket slips were printed. “If Baker Mayfield goes #1, we will get … blasted,” said one oddsmaker.</p>
<p>Football experts predominantly felt Darnold was the best quarterback in the class. Maybe the Browns know something they don’t, but then again, Cleveland passed on Carson Wentz in 2016.</p>
<p>Draft Recap</p>
<p>After the Browns immediately shook up the NFL Draft, the New York Giants grabbed Barkley, the Penn State star who was born in the Bronx. Many feel Saquon is the best overall talent in the class, but drafting a running back so high is often criticized.</p>
<p>Darnold went third to the New York Jets, Ohio State cornerback Denzel Ward fourth to the Browns, and Chubb fifth to the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>As for prop bets in Las Vegas, a few notables included “total number of SEC players drafted in first round.” The Westgate SuperBook had over eight at -110, and under eight at -110. Over won, as 10 players from the SEC were selected.</p>
<p>Odds for Big Ten round one total players drafted were at over 5.5 (-160), under 5.5 (+140). Under won, as just four players from the conference were taken.</p>
<p>Alabama Leads Pack</p>
<p>Alabama has been the most dominant program in college football over the last decade, and Nick Saban’s squad once again turned out the most newly minted pros. Four Crimson Tide alumni were drafted in round one, voiding bets at the SuperBook which had the over/under at that very number.</p>
<p>The Georgia Bulldogs produced three first-rounders, with under 4.5 bets at William Hill paying on odds of +120.</p>
<p>Another popular NFL Draft bet was whether more offensive players (+105) or defensive players (-125) would be selected in the first round. The underdog was the winning ticket, as 17 of the 32 selections were offensive players.</p>
<p>As for first round quarterbacks, the SuperBook had the over/under at five. Those wagers were annulled, as five it was.</p>
