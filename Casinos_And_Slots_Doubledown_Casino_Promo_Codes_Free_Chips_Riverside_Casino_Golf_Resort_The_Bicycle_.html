<p>The Star Sydney has a clear message to send to Australia’s regulators, which is that it will play by the rules come what may. In continuing to adjust its executive lineup, the property has appointed two new general managers who will be in charge of operations in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Hospitality Front and Center at Star Sydney</p>
<p>Christina Grasso and Jason Alcock have stepped in as a general manager of hotels, events &amp; guest experience, and general manager of food &amp; beverage respectively. Both are trusted employees at Star Entertainment Group, now tasked with ensuring that Star Sydney will operate smoothly and without ruffling regulatory feathers.</p>
<p>Alcock has held a variety of senior roles throughout the company, same as Grasso who spent three years of her career as director of hotels. She is a highly-seasoned professional who is part of the Accommodation Association of Australia NSW Advisory Board and has a deep understanding of tourism and consumer experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on this appointment, The Star Sydney COO Damian Quayle welcomed Grasso’s appointment and said:</p>
<p>Christina has been an exceptional leader, with an unwavering dedication to delivering guest service excellence across our three hotels – The Darling Sydney, The Star Grand Hotel and The Star Grand Residences. Star Sydney COO Damian Quayle</p>
<p>Quayle did not hesitate to express optimism about the imminent future of the tourist industry with fliers and guests beginning to come back. The Star Sydney, the executive said, is one of the properties they seek out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alcock brings his own unique experience to the property, having helped establish The Star Culinary Institute and generally been an important part of the food experience of the company.</p>
<p>He has introduced many excellent culinary concepts over the years, including Ele by Frederico and Karl, Mashi-no-Mashi and Rumble, and more. Anyone visiting The Star Sydney because they are a foodie would find Alcock has been taking good care of that.</p>
<p>Quayle has been equally optimistic about Alcock’s addition to the team. According to the executive, the food business is in excellent hands with Alcock’s promotion to the relevant position. The Star Sydney has been going through some difficult times.</p>
<p>Star Sydney Navigates a Difficult Legal Context</p>
<p>The property’s casino license is now on the line with an ongoing inquiry into its operations and potential anti-money laundering failings reflecting poorly on the casino’s reputation as such. The Star Sydney has been found “not fit” to hold a license, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that gaming floors will die down.</p>
<p>It simply means that regulators would step up their game and The Star Sydney would most likely need a special monitor to continue running gaming on its premises for a fixed period of time. Once the monitoring period is over, The Star Sydney will be examined again and suitability confirmed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New South Wales has introduced a new regulatory body that will use the findings of the inquiry which issued more than a dozen recommendations that will now be incorporated into the gambling industry in the state moving forward.</p>
<p>NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority (ILGA) expects the inquiry into The Stary Entertainment Group to end at the end of August.</p>
