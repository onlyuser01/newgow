<p>Google has updated its advertising policy under the category of "US Gambling and Games." This allows certified and state-licensed entities to promote New Yorks sportsbook ads.</p>
<p>The Alphabet-led company released its update on January 7, one day before the official New York State Gambling Commission (NYGC) allowed the launch of New York's sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Google stated in its revision, "From January 2022, the Google Ads Gambling and Games policy United States country specifics will be updated," Google cited - "We will begin to accept and run ads for sports betting from certified, state-licensed entities in New York from January 8."</p>
<p>Google will not allow sportsbook ads to be placed on its platforms unless "certified partners" are verified by Google to promote New York state-licensed sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Google confirmed that it has opened its certification and application process to advertisers who wish to publish online gambling content in accordance with NYGC laws.</p>
<p>Google closed its statement by confirming that it will update its US Gambling and Games webpage when the policy comes into effect.</p>
<p>Saturday saw licensed operators Caesars, DraftKings, Rush Street Interactive and FanDuel launch their New York-based mobile sportsbook services. Although New York licenses have been obtained, mobile sportsbooks Ballys, BetMGM, PointsBet, WynnBET and others have yet to be certified for launch. This will be monitored on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Google is currently the only tech giant that has published terms specific to New York sportsbook advertising.</p>
<p>Twitter allows US sportsbook advertising through its platform. However, advertisers must be based in the US and online gambling ads must contain disclaimers.</p>
<p>Facebook's global policy regarding gambling content is being maintained. Advertisers must obtain written permission to use any form of gambling advertising on Facebook's platforms.</p>
<p>Ryan Butler of Wagers.com estimated that $200 million was transacted in the first weekend of online betting in New York. These numbers translate into roughly $10 million in sportsbook revenue and $5 million in state taxes. Mobile sportsbooks pay a tax rate of 51%.</p>
<p>Comparatively, New York's retail betting tax revenue has been only $3.7 million in the last two fiscal years.</p>
<p>The state's gaming regulators predicted that the annual revenue would exceed $1.1 billion by 2025. These numbers may be closer than expected, but that is due to the immense success of the opening weekend.</p>
<p>The NFL Playoffs have yet to begin and the Super Bowl is just a few weeks away. New York's next monthly record will be set in the coming months.</p>
