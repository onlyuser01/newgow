    <h1>Winstar World Casino Hotel Rooms Strike Casino Casino In Council Bluffs Iowa Casino Spokane Bally S</h1>

<p>I have to strongly disagree with your statement that "It is standard practice in the industry, that when bonuses are given, may they be a deposit bonus or a free bonus, they come with certain rules attached". Yes, they sure come with certain rules attached, but your rules mentioned regarding these wager-free bonuses are not clearly, fairly, or adequately discribed, as even after reading the rules, this was the first time EVER I have misunderstood bonus terms on any casino, and I have played on dozens of casinos, and by googling you find many players complaining about these same wager-free bonuses. If many understand them wrongly, and have reported your casino of this, wouldn't it be a clear message, that the terms should be rewritten more clearly? Or is your revenue strategy to mislead players with bonus terms, rather than keeping one player playing at your casino more than once..?</p>
<p>Even now, after reading your terms below MANY times, to me the terms are not correct or adequate related to your casino's actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These bonus funds are given for wagering purposes only and will be removed from your account balance when you request a withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free Spins have no wagering requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum cash-out for free spins winnings bonus is €100.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the bonus funds are given for wagering purposes only, and the free spins have no wagering requirements, what is there to be wagered?</p>
<p>It is clearly said in the terms, that the bonus funds will be removed from your account balance when you request a withdrawal. My bonus funds (20 €) were not removed, all my other funds were removed.</p>
<p>And why was my bonus 20 € at the time of the withdrawal, as it was originally 47,70 €, and wager-free?</p>
<p>The maximum cash-out for free spins winnings bonus is said to be €100. That’s fine, but my free spins winnings were only 47,70 €. But I made other winnings from other games for an amount of 1 262.4 €. This is certainly not mentioned in the terms, that if you do the free spins and win whatever, e.g., 0.10 €, then, afterwards, whenever you decide to request for a withdrawal, you get basically nothing (well, your last deposit + max 100 €, even if you have won, let's say, 200 000 € after the spins). Is this clearly described in your terms? It sure ain't!!</p>
