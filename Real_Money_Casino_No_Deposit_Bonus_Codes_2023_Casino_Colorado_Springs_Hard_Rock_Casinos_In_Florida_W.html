<p>Reasons Why Cory Sandhagen is a -310 Favorite</p>
<p>Cory Sandhagen (16-4) is one of the best kickboxers in the UFC Bantamweight division, who also has some decent grappling skills. He’s a former title challenger who blew the title shot by losing to Petr Yan by a unanimous decision in October 2021. Since then, however, he’s 2-0.</p>
<p>First, he defeated Song Yadong by TKO (doctor stoppage) after the end of round 4. It was The Sandman’s seventh win by this method. Then, in his most recent fight, he defeated Marlon Vera. It was a split-decision win, but Sandhagen was the more impressive fighter for most of the time that evening.</p>
<p>The win over legendary Chito moved him up all the way to the No. 4 place in the divisional rankings. And if he wins a third fight in a row, we could see the UFC giving him another shot at the championship belt.</p>
<p>Rob Font Coming to Tennessee on a Short Notice</p>
<p>Rob Font (20-6) has a similar fighting style to Sandhagen. He too is great striking-wise, while also doing okay when it comes to grappling and wrestling. He’s already fought one fight in 2023. It happened in April when he defeated Adrian Yanex by a TKO, winning himself the Performance of the Night bonus along the way.</p>
<p>More importantly, the win meant that he ended his skid of two losses – to Jose Aldo and Marlon Vera. Both of those fights were 5-round bouts that lasted for the whole 25 minutes. What’s interesting is that he missed weight in the fight with Vera by 3.5 pounds. We think he’s gonna be even bigger this time, which could mean he’s going to struggle to get to the final bell. But then again, this guy (same as Sandhagen) has never been knocked out in his life.</p>
<p>Cory Sandhagen vs. Rob Font Prediction</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be surprised if Rob Font suffered his first KO/TKO loss this weekend. The thing is that he almost certainly isn’t in his best shape right now, and he’s fighting one of the best strikers in the division. Sure, this guy is tough as nails, but even if he stays up until the end of the fight, we think the judges will score in his opponent’s favor.</p>
<p>Pick: Cory Sandhagen to win</p>
