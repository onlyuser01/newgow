    <h1>Hollywood Casino Morgantown Redding Casino Deadwood Sd Casinos Casinos In Denver Colorado Casino Gre</h1>

<p>Dear Geir,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the relevant screenshots. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward your cashier/deposit history and confirm that the first request to block your account due to a gambling problem has been sent on 12th of February 2021? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/responsible_gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>Self- Exclusion is a more extensive way to control your activity at 24monaco.com.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion means that you decide to close your account for a period up to 3 months. In case you wish to Self- Exclude your account, please contact our Customer Support Team who will be happy to assist you."</p>
<p>https://24mcasino.com/templates/company/terms_and_conditions:</p>
<p>"Self exclude or Timeout - We will only reply to emails sent to support@24monaco.com for this action and clearly mark in the subject line 'Account Closure. Any emails not stating your reason for closing eg; gambling problem will not be actioned as an urgent request. We take these requests seriously but due to the high levels of emails it may take us some time to reply. Any deposits made before the account is closed will be accepted and are non refundable."</p>
<p>Could you please forward screenshots of your requests where casino’s email address will be clearly visible, hence we have solid evidence that all the requests have been sent to the correct email address?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
