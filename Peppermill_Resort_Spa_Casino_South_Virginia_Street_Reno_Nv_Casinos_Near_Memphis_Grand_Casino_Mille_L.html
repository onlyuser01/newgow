    <h1>Peppermill Resort Spa Casino South Virginia Street Reno Nv Casinos Near Memphis Grand Casino Mille L</h1>

<p>Nick, I thank you for any assistance. I am glad to answer your questions, hopefully the information will help you help me.</p>
<p>8/11/23 after all waging requirements were met, my balance was $400.87.</p>
<p>I contacted customer support to verify that I had met the requirements and to see what amount needed to be reduced from my withdrawal request. They indicated to me to reduce it by 122.10 and that all requirements have been met congratulations. At that time, I went ahead and sent in a withdrawal request for the amount of $278.77.</p>
<p>8/12/23 it shows the coupon reversal request in the amount of $122.10 and it also shows the request being approved thereby subtracting the amount of 122.10, leaving a balance of 278.77.</p>
<p>8/28/23 one transaction says a Bitcoin adjustment was requested but denied for $16. It also lists a manager request to withdraw for $16 and then the approval of the managers withdrawal of $16. That brought the balance down to $262.77.</p>
<p>9/11/23 Finally a Bitcoin deposit was directed to my account. It was actually split into two separate transactions, one for $31.63 and the other for $214.94 thereby making the entire deposit amount $246.57. (Short $16.20, no explanation or adjustment showing on the LL site) the total Network fee is listed at .42 on the $214 and .21 on the $31.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin is showing on 9/11/23, that's the date it was entered. After the batch is entered, it must be approved before the funds are available,that is where this account has been stuck for the last 13 days. Between the time it is entered and approved it goes runs through a prioritization that will process larger fees first and smaller fees get put on the back burner. I'm attaching a video that explained this very well to me and hopefully it will be an asset to you also.</p>
<p>I will also send copies of the transactions as they took place and the blockchain screenprints as well.</p>
<p>In regards to who is responsible, the payment provider or the casino.. what I have to go on is this, the network fees are 100% discretionary and I will have to assume that the amount of network fee is dictated directly by the casino. In addition to this, the casino is absolutely 100% the only entity that might be able to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to know a lot about bitcoin, what little I know has been learned in this last couple of months. There is a "OPT-in RBF" only the cinder would have access to do this. They would pull the money back increase the fees and send it through again, hopefully successful this time. It does not sound like this is used very often so I can only hope....</p>
<p>I believe I've covered the questions, if you have any further please let me know. I sincerely appreciate your time and attention to this matter!</p>
