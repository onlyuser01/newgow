    <h1>What Casinos Can You Gamble At 18 Casino Kansas City Mo Robert De Niro Casino Glasses Sls Sahara Cas</h1>

<p>The NASCAR series are back at the Daytona International Speedway for another captivating race in the 2020 Coke Zero Sugar 400 held on Saturday, August 29 at 7:30 pm ET. With the stakes truly high once again, we have all the usual suspects lined up for a shot at another victory, including Denny Hamlin, Joey Logano, and naturally Kevin Harvick.</p>
<p>For the nonce, though, we have Hamlin, and not Harvick, as the favorite, making the race an interesting thing to watch. Even though Harvick secured Drydene 311, he doesn’t seem to be the favorite the Coke Zero Sugar 400 race.</p>

<p>Harvick’s Drydene Victory: Not a Formula for Success</p>
<p>Harvick absolutely dominated on Sunday, getting back at Denny Hamlin who had caught up to Kevin Harvick’s wins for the season in Dover.</p>
<p>Yet, Drydene 311 proved to belong to Harvick who drove through the final with a fantastic lead. In fact, Harvick managed to stay ahead in 223 of the 311 laps at the race, and he has perched himself atop the leaderboard in the Cup Series.</p>
<p>Will this be enough for the 2020 Coke Zero Sugar 400? That’s the question we are trying to figure out. Harvick’s performance has been fantastic so far. Having the most points in the Cup Series doesn’t come easily.</p>
<p>He’s tied with Hamlin for the season’s most victories with 24 starts and six wins so far. Why is Hamlin priced above him? We think that his recent performance has been exceptional and he has shown consistency.</p>
<p>Hamlin and Harvick: Neck-and-Neck for a Seventh Win</p>
<p>Daytona isn’t a raceway you can approach with a casual can-do attitude, and that’s why we think Hamlin really has a great shot. He has actually won two of his last Daytona Raceway showings, putting him firmly as one of the favorites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he fared poorly at Dover, finishing mere 19th which is way behind any position that would make you comfortable betting on him. If that’s any consolation, though, he managed to notch up a victory or finish as the runner-up in his six races, bar one near-miss.</p>
<p>One of his most spectacular victories involves Ryan Newman’s car flip which was scary to behold, but thankfully Newman is alright and cleared to race once again! He returned in The Real Heroes 400 earlier this year.</p>
<p>Who Won the Last Five Races?</p>
<p>Year Driver 2020 Justin Haley 2019 Erik Jones 2018 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. 2017 Brad Keselowski 2016 Dale Earnhardt Jr.</p>
<p>Evidently, none of today’s favorites have had much luck over the past five races. Brad Keselowski priced (+1200) seems to be the only contender who may actually make it to the top once again, but with his most recent results faltering a wee bit and placing him 8th in the overall standing, it’s not very likely.</p>
<p>This Saturday’s race should be a neck-and-neck race between Hamlin and Harvick and that’s where our money will be.</p>
