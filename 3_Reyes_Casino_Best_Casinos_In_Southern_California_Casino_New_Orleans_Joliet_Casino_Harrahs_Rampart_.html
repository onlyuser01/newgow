<p>UK sports betting exchange operator Smarkets announced its plans to open a new office in the US as the company is looking to benefit from the gathering pace sports betting industry and has chosen the metro Washington DC area for its location.</p>
<p>‘Key Step’ towards US Growth</p>
<p>Smarkets founder and chief executive officer Jason Trost communicated his excitement that the company would open its US office in DC, highlighting the importance of the decision.</p>
<p>“Adding this new hub for our US operations will be a key step as we grow our American customer base with SBK. D.C. makes sense for so many reasons and is one of the most globally accessible cities in the country.” Jason Trost, CEO, Smarkets</p>
<p>Founded in 2008, Smarkets has been operating via its headquarters in London and office in Malta, and the opening of a new office in the US capital will significantly expand its presence not only in the US market but globally.</p>
<p>In 2019, Smarkets teamed with Full House Resorts to gain market access in Colorado, via Bronco Billy’s Casino in Cripple Creek, and Indiana, via the Rising Star Casino, for its SBK online sportsbook.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, in June 2020, the SBK sportsbook made its debut by going live in Colorado. Recently, Smarkets teamed with Affinity Interactive to power its SBK sportsbook offering in Iowa. The SBK app is also licensed for operations in Indiana.</p>
<p>‘Vibrant Tech Environment’</p>
<p>Speaking about the new office in DC, recently appointed US general manager Sheldon Hanai outlined that the company was planning for some time to open an office on the East Coast and DC was also his personal choice “due to its vibrant tech environment and diverse talent pool.”</p>
<p>“It’s also an energetic sports city with all of the major American sports represented and, of course, you’re right in the political and economic center of the US,” Hanai concluded.</p>
<p>Smarkets is planning on hiring business development, operations and marketing personnel for the office in DC. Hanai will also be based in the company’s new office in the capital.</p>
<p>In May, the UK-based betting exchange operator signed an agreement with Strive Sponsorship to ensure the marketing brand’s content, podcasts and editing services for its Smarkets News and SBK Betting Zone.</p>
<p>The deal expanded on an active partnership between Smarkets and Strive for the past four years during which Strive provided engaging sports content and services for Smarkets’ social media.</p>
