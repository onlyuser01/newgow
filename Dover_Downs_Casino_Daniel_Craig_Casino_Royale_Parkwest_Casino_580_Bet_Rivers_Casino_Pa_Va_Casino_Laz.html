    <h1>Dover Downs Casino Daniel Craig Casino Royale Parkwest Casino 580 Bet Rivers Casino Pa Va Casino Laz</h1>

<p>Damn, I just had to go through the whole conversation just to figure out what's going on here. I may overlooked some important facts, but if I understand it correctly, phein67 is waiting for 300 eur to be paid for 4 days and others try to explain that it's not so long period of time?</p>
<p>There's really no reason to use so bad language because of such a small issue. I understand that people want their money as soon as possible when they withdraw them. Some people say "how come my deposits are instant, but withdrawals take days"? The thing is - most of deposits aren't instant and you play with money that the casino gave you so you can play immediately even though the casino needs to wait sometimes for a few days until the deposit reaches their account.</p>
<p>I've been in the business for enough time just to know that some withdrawals can take longer, but whenever it's over 14 days, then it's just strange. I also know many casinos have issues with banks and payment providers when it comes to sending money to Germany (because of the gambling regulation there).</p>
<p>So it's simple as that. The casino will most probably pay or they'll may request additional documents for further verification, but it doesn't sound like a big issue you should argue here about to be honest.</p>
