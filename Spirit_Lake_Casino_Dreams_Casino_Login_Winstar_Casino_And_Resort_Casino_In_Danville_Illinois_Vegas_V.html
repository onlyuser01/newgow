<p>GiG will be the official technology partner for PlayStar’s upcoming online casino in New Jersey, which will launch in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>PlayStar Casino to Launch Powered by GiG’s Platform</p>
<p>The PlayStar Casino brand continues to prepare for its debut in the United States, teaming up with the Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to power the company’s online casino brand in the country, pending new market additions in other states to follow at a later stage.</p>
<p>GiG is now going to power PlayStar’s New Jersey casino which is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of the year. With iGaming still overtaking sports betting in terms of sheer revenue, PlayStar has taken a cautious approach to its market entry in the Garden State, teaming up with Atlantic City’s Ocean Casino for market access.</p>
<p>According to the company, though, New Jersey is just first of many roll-outs to follow, and other markets are envisaged for 2022, with more details to be revealed at a later point. Commenting on this development, PlayStar co-founder and executive vice president Adam Noble said that he was looking forward to bring a world-class online casino experience to players in the state.</p>
<p>Noble spared no compliments for GiG which he described as a pivotal technologic company and a trusted partner in Europe and beyond. PlayStar feels much more confident entering in the Garden State and the United States with GiG’s backing, Noble added.</p>
<p>GiG Confident in the Partnership Between the Companies</p>
<p>A corresponding sentiment came from GiG chief executive Richard Brown who lauded PlayStar’s own staying power in the gaming space and said that GiG was excited to be joining the operator on its innovative and inspiring journey through the US digital gambling market.</p>
<p>The executive also added that “PlayStar has an extremely strong product vision backed by a very experienced industry team.” GiG and PlayStar have agreed to establish a revenue-sharing model, which will run for a period of at least four year, subject to revision once the contract reaches maturity.</p>
<p>GiG has already been in the news this year, with the company agreeing to enhance gaming operator and betting firm bet365’s regulatory compliance across numerous markets. At the beginning of the year, GiG granted key employees within the organization the right to buy shares, seeking to bolster involvement from staff members.</p>
