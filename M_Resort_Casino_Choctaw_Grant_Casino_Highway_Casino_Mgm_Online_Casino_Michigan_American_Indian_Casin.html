<p>Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (ADM)</p>
<p>Online casinos in Italy are regulated by the gaming division of the Excise, Customs and State Monopolies Agency. Online gambling has been legal in Italy since 2006, but was originally only allowed for localized operators. Since 2010, the market has gradually become more accessible to foreign operators, but all must obtain a license from the ADM and meet stringent criteria to be able to offer their services to Italian players. How to check a license To check that an online gambling site is registered with the ADM, there is a list of authorized dealers for remote gaming. All legitimate operators and the websites that they offer can be found here. Additionally, there is a list of blocked websites that the ADM has inhibited due to offering online gambling without the proper authorizations, and any illegal gaming websites should be reported by sending an email to monopoli.segnalazionesiti@adm.gov.it.</p>
<p>Complaints and disputes Players wishing to make a complaint regarding an operator that they feel has violated ADM regulations must first download the relevant document and complete the complaints and suggestions form. The form should then be submitted to Giochi.reclami.online@aams.it. The regulator will respond within 30 days, investigate the situation and take any action deemed appropriate.</p>
