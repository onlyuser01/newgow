<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have tested several casinos with the bonuses, and I have detected something very similar to the vast majority.</p>
<p>When playing for the first time on a slot of my choice that I have never played, I usually and in most cases get good payouts. If I go back there, I will hardly get a reasonable prize again. Which leads me to suppose that the software is "handled" eventually with customer data. I'm computer, and there are many ways to "tell" the software if client X (customer data, eg email address, date of birth, username, other data) to play...... prizes in the order of cents, nothing more. Casinos use almost all of the same game providers and if they wish they can program the games with certain parameters, in this case customer data (as when a customer registers at a casino, they have to provide certain data about themselves. I've played at several casinos, what I described above happens to a good part of them.</p>
<p>Conclusion: playing in online casinos where previously we have to give a lot of information about ourselves, raises many doubts about their seriousness and honesty. Preferable to go to a fixed Casino. The odds (I think) will be greater of making gains</p>
