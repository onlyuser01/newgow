<p>According to WSOP, the player that won the tournament was nicknamed “incel4life.” For the moment, the real identity of the player that won the High Roller tournament is not disclosed. Regardless, as the winner, incel4life collected a $318,889 prize from the tournament.</p>
<p>Top 5 Players: WSOP Online Event #7: $3,200 High Roller</p>
<p>Position Player Prize 1 “incel4life” $318,889 2 Chad “alienprobed” Eveslage $198,959 3 Dylan “sobchak67” Linde $134,575 4 Josh “nitbuster” Arieh $96,049 5 Kevin “GoneBananas” Garosshen $65,308</p>
<p>WSOP’s 7th online event attracted quite a few seasoned poker pros. Paul “Cushty” Richardson, Josh “nitbuster” Arieh and Kevin “GoneBananas” Garosshen are among the players in the top 10. Moreover, Chad “alienprobed” Eveslage as well as Dylan “sobchak67” Linde also participated in the $3,200 High Roller event.</p>
<p>Although Richardson came close to the top 5, he didn’t make the cut and hit the rail taking 6th place with a $46,969 prize. On the other hand, Garosshen took 5th place followed by Arieh that ended 4th. While Garosshen collected $65,308, Arieh’s prize was $96,049. Linde was the next player that was eliminated. By taking 3rd place, he took home a hefty $134,575 prize.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Eveslage played well, but he took 2nd place in the tournament which brought him a $198,959 prize. Last month, in Event #2: $25,000 H.O.R.S.E, the poker pro was once again a part of the top 5 players. Back then, Eveslage took 4th place which brought him a $169,218 prize.</p>
<p>Should the Online Events Be Bracelet Events?</p>
<p>In light of incel4life’s tournament win, a discussion on Reddit was started. One user nicknamed “schmuloppey” said that online events shouldn’t be bracelet events. They received a response from another user who revealed that online poker is just another format of the game that people play. That user stressed that playing online poker requires a different skill and that such games “absolutely should be bracelet events.”</p>
