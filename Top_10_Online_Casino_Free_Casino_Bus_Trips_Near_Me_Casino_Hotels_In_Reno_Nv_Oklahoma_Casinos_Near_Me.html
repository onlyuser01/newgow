    <h1>Top 10 Online Casino Free Casino Bus Trips Near Me Casino Hotels In Reno Nv Oklahoma Casinos Near Me</h1>

<p>A new report by ABC News Australia has outlined an unpalatable truth – Australian teenagers are increasingly turning to online gambling websites, and they are developing gambling problems as a result. The report cites data by Gamblers Anonymous, an NGO dedicated to offering support to vulnerable individuals who are battling addiction.</p>
<p>Based on the organization’s reports, more Australian teenagers are now attending meetings, whether they go there voluntarily or are brought by a parent. Organizers of such meetings have spoken with the media outlet, describing the cases they have dealt with. Many of the people who turned up at Gamblers Anonymous meetings were on the edge of losing everything, one organizer identified as Chris told the publication.</p>
<p>Others have gone further attempting to take their own lives without their family ever being any the wiser that their loved one had a gambling problem. Chris is also a recovering gambling addict who left that life behind. A college graduate now, Chris is still helping people who are struggling with the trauma of gambling addiction and are looking for a way out.</p>
<p>He noted that many of the people who use sports betting apps today are "younger guys" who may end up losing a week’s pay with a few clicks on their mobile devices. But the government is not sitting by idly, says the media, citing information by Responsible Wagering Australia, an industry body, which is an important opportunity for lawmakers and the community to work together and ensure that gambling-related harm is reduced in the country.</p>
<p>One argument is the proliferation of gambling advertisements which exposes many people to gambling products at an early age and goes on to become the source of gambling addiction later in life. But Responsible Wagering Australia insists that whatever changes are passed moving forward, they should focus exclusively on supporting vulnerable individuals rather than restrict the industry for the majority of those who enjoy it purely for its entertainment value.</p>
<p>However, non-industry representatives, such as trauma surgeon John Crozier, told ABC that more needs to be done to ensure that the online gambling industry – and the land-based sector as well – are "reigned in." The algorithms used by the online industry, says Crozier, are designed to target those who are the most likely to spend, but also those who are the most likely to have a problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a debate to introduce cashless gaming across Australia has been opposed by some organizations, arguing that regular gamblers would feel like criminals if they were to have their transactions scrutinized. Australia announced new gambling ads messaging in November in order to try and raise awareness about how dangerous these products can be.</p>
