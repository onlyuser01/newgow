<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement has revealed the latest gambling industry results for February 2023, covering sports wagering and casino activities in the Garden State. The state regulator outlined the total amount of money the nine licensed casinos in the state, their partners, and racetracks were able to collect in the period.</p>
<p>The casino win for the properties stood at $215m, or an increase of 1.2% compared to February 2022 when the total revenue collected was $212.4m. The year-to-date casino win results were also strong, with the first two months of the year already raking in as much as $426.6m, or up 7.7% from the same period in 2022, when the casino win stood at $396.1m.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement looked into the results and offered a breakdown of the internet gaming win and sports wagering gross revenue.
