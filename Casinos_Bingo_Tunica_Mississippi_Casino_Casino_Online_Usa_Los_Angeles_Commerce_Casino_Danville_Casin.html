<p>Boris Chaikin, the first CEO of Soft2Bet Group, the growing software solutions provider for the iGaming and sportsbook industry, announced his plans to step down.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Group Decides to Step Down</p>
<p>In a statement released via LinkedIn today, Chaikin said he is stepping down from the position of CEO of the company. He thanked Uri Poliavich, the company’s Chief Business Development officer, for the opportunity. Chaikin also thanked all of the managers, employees, team leads and B2B clients that he collaborated during the last four years.</p>
<p>“After a bit over 4 years as the first CEO of the company, the time has come to move on and make the announcement that I have stepped down as a CEO of the Soft2Bet Group.” Boris Chaikin, ex-CEO at Soft2Bet Group</p>
<p>The Company Has Seen Tremendous Growth</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Group’s ex-CEO acknowledged that the announcement brings him mixed feelings, considering that he leaves a dedicated team of professionals some of which he considers friends. However, Chaikin pointed out that he is proud of the achievements the company completed while he was in charge.</p>
<p>Such achievements included significant growth. Since 2018, when Chaikin first joined Soft2Bet, the company grew from a team with less than 100 people, to more than 1,000 employees within three different locations in Europe. What’s more, the company has secured several licenses to operate in Europe while in Latin America and Sweden, it is in the process of obtaining licenses for its B2B and B2C operations. For the time Chaikin spearheaded the company, it has also reported double-digit growth every quarter. According to Chaikin, Soft2Bet is “one of the rising stars on the online gambling horizon.” Last but not least, he pointed out that as a shareholder, he is confident of the future success of the company.</p>
<p>Besides Chakin’s resignation, only recently Soft2Bet announced another senior leadership change. On Monday the company revealed that Neven Nikov is no longer holding the position of CEO of the Group. The company wished him good luck and outlined that until a successor is selected, Poliavich will be serving as interim CEO.</p>
