<p>Francaise des Jeux’s sports betting brand, Parions Sport, just inked its biggest and most important sponsorship deal yet. As per the deal, the company will now be the official sponsor of France’s rugby federation, the Fédération Française de Rugby through 2024.</p>
<p>Parions Sport to Support French Rugby</p>
<p>The agreement will see the sports betting operator as the team sponsor of the federation’s Men’s and Women’s XV teams for the next two years. In return, Parions Sport will enjoy an increased presence on the rugby federation’s official media and in stadiums during the French teams’ home games.</p>
<p>Additionally, Parions Sport will include a variety of rugby content across its digital networks and social media. Thanks to Francaise des Jeux’s partnership with 27,000 unique merchants, Parions will distribute and promote French rugby. Not only that, but Parions Sport will also support the French rugby sector by helping the French Rugby Federation host the upcoming 2023 RFU Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p>Fans can visit the operator’s content to find exclusive odds or to benefit from promotions that give them the chance to win free tickets for some of the hottest rugby games.</p>
<p>The Federation Is Excited by Parions’ Commitment</p>
<p>Francaise des Jeux released a statement about the deal, saying that it is thrilled to team up with the rugby federation. The company hopes that this deal will be a long-lasting one as it believes that Parions Sport and the federation share the same core values of respect and solidarity.</p>
<p>The betting brand’s parent company is delighted by the opportunity to support professional French rugby and by extension support France on the global sporting scene.</p>
<p>Bernard Laporte, the president of the French Rugby Federation, welcomed Parions Sport as a partner. He noted that the brand is an ambitious one and is one that has a clear vision for the next few years of partnership.</p>
<p>According to Laporte, Parions Sport’s commitment is a historical moment in the history of French rugby and French sports as a whole. He is convinced that this is the beginning of a great partnership that will have a great beneficial effect on French rugby.</p>
<p>Francaise des Jeux is a company that has demonstrated its support of professional sports numerous times. The company is partnering with some of the most esteemed sports events in the world, including the famous American National Basketball League.</p>
<p>In December last year, Francaise des Jeux’s tech and innovation brand, FDJ Gaming Solutions signed a deal with Carrus that will see FDJ power Veikkaus with a digital development platform.</p>
