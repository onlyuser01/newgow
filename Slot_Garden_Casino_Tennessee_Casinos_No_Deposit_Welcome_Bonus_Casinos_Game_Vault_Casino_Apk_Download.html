<p>The game is the freshest addition to the gaming studio’s lobby which hosts a number of thrilling games that rely on gambling skills. The list includes games like Casino Blocks, Jade Puzzle, Cash Quiz, Casino Cash Smash, and Speedy Candy. Green Jame Games’ Arcade Lobby is packed with different game genres, ranging from puzzles, first-person shooters, and brick breaker games. Green Jade players eager to keep close track of their progress can use the dedicated leaderboard.</p>
<p>The company’s chief commercial officer Mark Taffler commented on the new release, saying the game “says it all” on itself, mentioning the game’s inspiration in the popular whack-a-mole style of games with the added gambling element. Taffler also mentioned players’ visible thirst for arcade games based on gambling skills in the past year which he believes will be ongoing in the “foreseeable future”. He called Tap Tap Splat “a great addition” to the company’s continuously growing lobby, praising its ability to truly stand up compared to other slot games on the market.</p>
<p>How to Play Tap Tap Splat</p>
<p>Players can expect to charge themselves with plenty of positive vibes while whacking cute and colorful jelly monsters ready to pop out their holes. Before the beginning of each new round, players are supposed to bet on their skills and ability to whack the jumping monsters. After the bet is placed, a new 60-second round is initiated. During it, the player must prove his skills and hit as many monsters as possible. The more hits they have, the greater their rewards. Tap Tap Splat has four different types of monsters: blue, red, purple, and green. Each color corresponds to a certain number of points.</p>
<p>The game becomes even more interesting when the player hits a bomb and his number of reward points drops by 150. Once a player reaches the 500 points mark, the bonus game is engaged. During the bonus game, players enjoy higher winnings without having to worry about any exploding bombs.</p>
<p>In June, Pariplay decided to add Green Jade Games’ arcade titles to its Fusion platform.</p>
