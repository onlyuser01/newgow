Owen will popularize the brand with his own network of more than 3.7 million social followers and will work on YouTube video content where he will discuss the operator and what it has to offer.</p>
<p>Punt Casino Strengths Brand Exposure</p>
<p>The former British national soccer player has played for numerous teams in his time, including Liverpool, Newcastle United, Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Stoke City. He is a known face to soccer fans and Punt Casino has teamed up with the man to tap into his likeness and connect with audiences who are keen on exploring cryptocurrency betting.</p>

<p>Commenting on his joining the brand, Owen said that Punt Casino is doing things differently when it comes to gaming, and essentially “changing the game.” Owen admitted that he too was a strong supporter of cryptocurrencies and believed in their practical application for a range of activities:</p>
<p>“Online casinos are more exciting than ever these days, but with its crypto focus, Punt Casino is doing something different; they really are changing the game.” Punt Casino brand ambassador Michael Owen</p>
<p>Great Addition of Prominent Player</p>
<p>Punt Casino head of marketing Alexander Bowring commented that Owen’s appointment was well-met and that he met a lot to the world of soccer as well as the brand itself. Punt has already been achieving some important milestones, Bowring said, adding:</p>
<p>“Since launching last year, Punt Casino has been changing the game, delivering exciting crypto casino action. Expect big things from Punt Casino in 2022 and beyond. Punt Casino head of marketing Alexander Bowring</p>
<p>As the company plans for the long-term, Owen is a great fit. The man was previously a brand ambassador for BetVictor back in 2014 and has done well.
