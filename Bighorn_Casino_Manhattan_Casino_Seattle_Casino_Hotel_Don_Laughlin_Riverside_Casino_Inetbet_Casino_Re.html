<p>Relax Gaming, the award-winning supplier of proprietary iGaming content has released Hex, a brand new high volatility slot with a cool voodoo theme. The game features a generous Return to Player rate and max win, along with plenty of mysterious symbols to keep the fun going.</p>
<p>Mystery Games Are Fun to Create and Even More Fun to Play</p>
<p>If you love slots with spooky themes that can give you cold shivers down your spine, get ready to try Relax Gaming’s freshest release. The game will carry you inside a captivating voodoo shop filled with mysterious potions, ointments, and spells. Mix them right and they will bring you the luckiest wins on the reels.</p>
<p>The talented Relax Gaming crew invites players to visit the enchanting voodoo shop and make full use of all the sticky mystery symbols they can find there, including reels expansions and mystery reveals symbols. These magical helpers will assist shop visitors on their quest to find the Exit sign right before being completely swept off their feet by the dark magic inside.</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, the chief product officer for Relax Gaming admitted that slots that are inspired by magic and mystery trigger the most excitement in developers. Hammon expects their new Hex slot game to be equally engaging to play as it was to create in their state-of-the-art gaming laboratories.</p>
<p>The leading iGaming aggregation that received a UK gaming supplier license last May currently offers a massive library consisting of more than 3,000 fantastic proprietary slot games. The aggregator also offers several cherry-picked games from third-party gaming developers as part of important partnerships.</p>

<p>Hex is an excellent game for players who appreciate a high volatility slot. The game features 5×3 reels or 5×4 reels in free spins mode, a 96.43% RTP rate on the standard game, and 96.58% RTP when using the feature buy option. With a maximum win set at 25,000x and 243 excellent ways to win during the standard base game, Hex is an attractive new competitor to similar games in the industry.</p>
<p>Now a little something about the action on the reels. Coming across three scatters will trigger seven free spins. Finding four scatter symbols will bring you ten free spins, while five scatters will engage 15 free spins. Plus, the game offers an extra free spin every time a scatter symbol lands on the reels while using the free spins.</p>
<p>Before you can jump into the free spins action, you will notice some magic happening right in front of your eyes: the reel area will start expanding and new rows with mysterious symbols will pop up. This will create a mind-blowing number of 1024 ways to win.</p>
<p>Players who manage to match symbols across a minimum of three adjacent reels starting with the left reel will collect an awesome pay-way win. The game can also be played in Autoplay, even though the gripping gaming experience will most likely keep you glued to the screen of your device until the Exit sign will be in sight.</p>
