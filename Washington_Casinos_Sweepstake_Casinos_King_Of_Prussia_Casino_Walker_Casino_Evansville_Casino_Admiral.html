<p>Dear Anonimo,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the casinos Responsible gambling section (https://www.starvegas.es/en/responsible-gaming) and I found this:</p>
<p>„Suspension/Self-exclusion</p>
<p>You can exclude yourself from gaming at StarVegas at any point of time. We offer account suspension of various durations, ranging from 24 hours, a week or a month to a period of several months. Your account will be automatically reopened after the period you have selected has expired.</p>
<p>You can also apply self-exclusion to your account, for a period of 6 months or for an indefinite period of time. Once the minimum period of 6 months expires, you will have to contact our Customer Service and request a reopening of your account if you want to play again.</p>
<p>During the period of your suspension/exclusion, you’ll be able to log into your account, but unable to deposit money or actively use your account."</p>
<p>Also, this is stated in T&amp;Cs (https://www.starvegas.es/en/terms-and-conditions):</p>
<p>„4. A self-exclusion may also be imposed by the Players themselves directly in the Account settings, by email to soporte@starvegas.es, or by calling the Responsible Gaming Helpline telephone number during working hours on +34 900838852, stating their username and passing through our security checks. The self-exclusion period can be chosen by the Player and extended indefinitely. During the self-exclusion period, no deposit it permitted; withdrawals are permitted. Any outstanding wagers or bets at the time of the Player's self-exclusion will be settled in the normal way, according to the normal timescales and, if applicable, winnings paid to the Player. Any Account blocks due to self-exclusion cannot be undone during the agreed self-exclusion period."</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you have contacted casino support and requested permanent self-exclusion?</p>
<p>I will be waiting for your reply patiently.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
