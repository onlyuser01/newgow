<p>The acclaimed and award-winning supplier of iGaming content, Hacksaw Gaming, has established a new partnership with Rush Street Interactive’s BetRivers brand in Ontario, expanding its own reach and ensuring that its catalogue of games is once again fully available to players in the province of Canada.</p>
<p>The news was shared by Hacksaw Gaming on the company’s official website, with CCO Gabrielle Star welcoming the opportunity to expand the content’s reach with Rush Street Interactive, a company of significant standing in the iGaming industry. Star added:</p>
<p>"We have made great strides in Ontario over the past few months, and the market remains of key strategic importance as we continue to bolster our footprint in regulated territories."</p>
<p>The executive argued that this integration would make the Hacksaw Gaming products available to even more players and allow them to experience classic and modern releases by the company, including Stick’Em and Mayan Stackways. The content alliance covers both existing and forthcoming titles, which will give BetRivers plenty of fresh content to work with and introduce to local crowds.</p>
<p>Naturally, the collaboration was welcomed by Rush Street Interactive CEO Richard Schwartz who said that the company was absolutely pleased to announce this new partnership with Hacksaw Gaming. He hailed the tie-up as an opportunity to build the brand’s presence in Ontario further and ensure that BetRivers continues to bring only the best experiences and opportunities to local iGaming players.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Hacksaw Gaming has established a similar partnership in Ontario. Previously, the supplier signed a content partnership with BetMGM, another well-represented brand locally. Hacksaw Gaming has also been scaling its global presence with numerous market entries and partnerships across the board.</p>
<p>The company secured a Swedish license to continue to provide iconic games such as Mines, Hand of Anubis, Wanted Dead or a Wild and Dork Unit in the iGaming market in the country. Not least, Hacksaw Gaming launched with MaxBet in Romania to bring even more worthwhile options to players in the country.</p>
