    <h1>Sky River Casino Reviews Casino Caribbean Sheraton Puerto Rico Casino 66 Casino Hotel And Casinos Ne</h1>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>after playing and fully wagering a bonus on February 28th, 2022, I cannot withdraw the €100 I have reached.</p>
<p>First it was pointed out that I have to send documents again, although I am fully verified as of July 2021.</p>
<p>This included, among other things, a driver's license, because the identity card was already available and does not count. (What the...?)</p>
<p>In the end, they asked for proof from the mobile phone provider.</p>
<p>Since I use a company mobile phone, I could not prove this at first. I then received and sent an invoice and the contract from the employer. Of course, I had hidden all the data relating to my employer - that's why the proof was rejected.</p>
<p>On March 10th, 2022 I sent several screenshots from my private mobile phone with a different number and asked them to change my number in the system.</p>
<p>Today the proof was also rejected.</p>
<p>However, it gets even better, today I was informed that my withdrawal request was canceled and €75.21 will be retained due to T&amp;C 12.10 violations.</p>
<p>It's about VPN etc., but I've never used anything like that.</p>
<p>Now I can pay out €25, although a bank withdrawal is only possible from a minimum of €100. Furthermore, I am not fully verified, as all mobile phone proofs are arbitrarily rejected.</p>
<p>Obviously Svenplay is cheating on me and never intended to cash out.</p>
<p>I ask for help in this case.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
