<p>Dear c5srx49hpn and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time and posting a review about LevelUp Casino.</p>
<p>There are no words to express how sorry we are that the player has a negative impression of our casino and that this situation has occurred. We understand how frustrating it can be for the customer.</p>
<p>However, we would like to shed light on the situation that occurred. We want to highlight that the player did not use the email address registered with our casino to send us letters. Please note that requests were only submitted via live chat.</p>
<p>Additionally, c5srx49hpn told us via chat that Apple’s service randomly generated the email address that was used for registration, so the player could not email us. In order to confirm the game account, we requested the player send us the letter. The request was sent, but it was sent from an incorrect email address, and the closure request was never mentioned.</p>
<p>Also, we would like to emphasize that under our Privacy Policy and GDPR, all player information, including their data, remains confidential and cannot be disclosed. Therefore, security concerns require players to contact us from the initial and active account. It is important to note that LevelUp Casino reserves the right to verify a player’s identity before processing payouts.</p>
<p>Besides, the customer was informed and advised regarding Responsible Gambling as soon as c5srx49hpn told the personal manager of the possible gambling problem, and the limit was set by the player on 2023-07-14 at 13:49:56 UTC.</p>
<p>In any case, regarding technical difficulties, we apologize for any inconvenience the player may have encountered. Our team is always loyal to our players and does its utmost to provide users with a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for bringing to our attention your experience while playing games in our casino. We are constantly actively testing our website to ensure any technical issues are resolved and avoided in the future.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to note that we have not received any requests regarding technical issues from the player in chatting with customer support. It is possible that c5srx49hpn sent the letters to us, but they did not reach us. The player reported technical issues to the personal manager later in the chat but did not provide specific details.</p>
<p>For future investigation, we recommend contacting our support team with a detailed description of the issue. We will be delighted to resolve any possible inconvenience.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding cashout limitations, we would like to bring to your attention that, due to our terms and conditions, the maximum withdrawal amount processed to a player is 3,000 EUR per day. To get more information, please follow the link: https://levelupcasino.com/terms-and-conditions or on the screenshot: https://prnt.sc/QH3Um6-uQKCB</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our team processes the withdrawal requests on a first-come-first-serve basis. Usually, the checkup of a request itself takes up to 2 hours.</p>
<p>As a result of our verification, we can confirm that the player made several cashout requests simultaneously; the team canceled a withdrawal that exceeded the daily limit, and the player recalled a cashout processing at that time.</p>
<p>As for now, we can confirm that the player’s account has been closed permanently due to gambling problems. We are really sorry to hear that you developed a gambling problem. But you did the right step into the right direction by self-excluding yourself from gambling.</p>
<p>Our team looks forward to your understanding in this regard.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>LevelUp Casino Team</p>
