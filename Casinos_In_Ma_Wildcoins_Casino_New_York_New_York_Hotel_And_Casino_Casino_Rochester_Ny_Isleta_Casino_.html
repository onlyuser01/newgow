<p>Dragon Spin review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dragon Spin is a nice little slot from Bally, who have opted to take the visual style of Chinese Dragon slots and modernise them a bit with a new colour scheme (blue and orange, rather than red and gold) and a range of designs for the dragons.</p>
<p>The result is a slot that feels both brand new and yet strangely familiar. Most importantly, it manages to avoid the stereotyping that dogs so many East Asian themed slots.</p>
<p>Big win in the Dragon Spin's free spins bonus game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent. As well as being rendered in a modern 3D style, this slot has been given a lot of flare by some talented artists. The four dragon symbols each have oodles of personality, which makes each dragon feel like a fully realised character.</p>
<p>The animations aren’t as flashy, but do the job they are there to do. They help make wins easy to read and add movement to the visuals to keep them interesting.</p>
<p>The music is a little off for a slot like this, a percussion-based soundtrack that feels more dance-like than suggestive of dragons or China. But it works well enough to make it not worth muting.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a five reel slot with three rows and thirty paylines.</p>
<p>Dragon Spin also has a feature called Mystery Stacked Reels. At the start of each spin, a randomly chosen symbol (excluding Scatter symbol) is assigned to be stacked on the reels, creating opportunities to land wins across multiple win lines.</p>
<p>Mystery Stacked Reels is present in both base game and free spins</p>
<p>There are a range of bonus games (see below for full details) to keep players on their toes.</p>
<p>Overall, the gameplay feels like it is constantly changing in small ways that maintain the player’s interest.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter only appears on reel 2, 3 and 4. Landing a Scatter on all three reels triggers the Free Spin Bonus game.</p>
<p>The Free Spin Bonus consists of five free spins with one of three randomly chosen features:</p>
<p>the Raining Wilds feature adds three to ten random Wilds to every spin;</p>
<p>feature adds three to ten random Wilds to every spin; the Persisting Wilds feature adds fewer Wilds on average on each spin, but they are then locked in place for the remaining free spins;</p>
<p>feature adds fewer Wilds on average on each spin, but they are then locked in place for the remaining free spins; and the Reel Blast feature creates three separate slot games stacked on top of each other, with reels 2, 3 and 4 shared between all three. During the Reel Blast, those central three reels will all be the same symbol across all three slot games.</p>
<p>1 of 3 free spins features: Persisting Wilds (commonly known as Sticky Wilds)</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.94%, at the bottom end of or rough range for average, which we set at around 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 up to a maximum of $/£/€120.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a very poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies, since our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>All the free spins use slightly modified payouts.</p>
<p>Dragon Spin - paytable for the base game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If the adorable dragon characters aren’t enough to keep you playing, then you might be persuaded by the decent RTP and varied bonus games.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, set against those pluses are the low volatility (although this might not bother some players) and a somewhat tired theme of Chinese Dragons.</p>
<p>As a result, any recommendation we might make of this game would depend on matching the game to the right player’s tastes.</p>
