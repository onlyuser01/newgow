    <h1>Lucky Ducky Casino Coconut Creek Casino Login New Casino Sites Hotels Near Treasure Island Casino Wi</h1>

<p>I'm having trouble with withdrawals.</p>
<p>・I applied for the first time on November 17th, so I contacted them because it was late.</p>
<p>We are told that ``Our company has already completed the processing, so it may be a delay on the payment provider's side (VegaWallet).''</p>
<p>・I use it regularly and have never had this happen, so I contacted Vega.</p>
<p>``Oh My Spin has been suspended because it was discovered that Vega was being used without going through the official procedures, and withdrawals will not be possible until the official procedures are completed at the member store.''</p>
<p>・As a result, since the formal procedures were not carried out, a refund will be issued.</p>
<p>・You will receive a standard email to cancel your withdrawal and be prompted to change your withdrawal method.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a bank transfer, but the system allows deposits but not withdrawals, so I gave up and deposited again at JETON.</p>
<p>・Because there are wagering conditions attached to the deposited amount, the amount is used up and the funds are meaninglessly reduced.</p>
<p>Since I managed to clear the wagering requirements, I applied for a withdrawal using the JETON I used for depositing.</p>
<p>However, once again I received a standard email canceling the withdrawal and it was returned to my balance.</p>
<p>Currently, I am in this situation and have contacted them via email, but I have not received a reply.</p>
<p>I have asked many times through live chat.</p>
<p>In the end, the answer was "I'll escalate this to the finance department and email them" and nothing was resolved.</p>
<p>Casino Guru has a good reputation, but I think this case is malicious.</p>
<p>What should I do? Please give me some advice.</p>
