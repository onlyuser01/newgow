    <h1>Quechan Casino Resort Cool Cat Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes 2023 Lucky Land Casino Casinos Nyc</h1>

<p>One of the world’s leading sports betting entertainment companies, OpenBet, has expanded its collaboration with a local Greek operator to strengthen both companies’ positions in the regulated market</p>
<p>Moving forward, OpenBet has been confirmed as the long-term partner for OPAP’s online sportsbook. OpenBet has already been working with a number of tier-one operators and World Lottery Association members to supply them with outstanding content and betting fixtures, which is precisely what OPAP will benefit from as well moving forward.</p>
<p>OpenBet Leverages Its Full Portfolio of Solutions with OPAP</p>
<p>OPAP will benefit from the full suite of OpenBet’s world-class betting technology, trading solutions and not least – sports content via SportCast. OpenBet is happy to consolidate its presence in Greece with a leading operator, as it continues to grow its presence in the European market.</p>
<p>OpenBet and OPAP seek to create an unparalleled experience for their customers, providing reliable, safe, and responsible entertainment. OPAP CEO Jan Karas commented on this new partnership and welcomed the addition of OpenBet. Karas said that the company was looking forward to leveraging OpenBet’s expertise and high-end tech solutions to significantly upgrade the customer experience at OPAP.</p>
<p>OpenBet Group CEO Jordan Levin was of a similar mind and said that the company was very happy to deliver best-in-class solutions for OPAP moving forward. Levin spoke highly of the technological offer that OpenBet was capable of delivering, touting the company’s flexible and tailor-made solutions that will undoubtedly benefit OPAP’s business.</p>
<p>OpenBet Has Been Excelling on Global Scale</p>
<p>“It’s another huge milestone for OpenBet and we’re looking forward to working with Jan and his team at OPAP,” Levin concluded. Meanwhile, OpenBet has been strengthening its own operations in more than one way.</p>
<p>The company obtained a “Great Place to Work” distinction and was listed on The Best Workplaces list in February. The platform also enjoyed a very strong performance during last month’s Super Bowl, one of the biggest sports events on the calendar in the United States. Not least, OpenBet was chosen by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation to boost the PlayNow.com iGaming and betting platform.</p>
<p>The latest expansion in Greece reaffirms the company’s global outlook and commitment to consistently growing and scaling its operations.</p>
