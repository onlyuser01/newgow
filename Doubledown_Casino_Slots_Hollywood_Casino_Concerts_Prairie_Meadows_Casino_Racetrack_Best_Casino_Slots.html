<p>The new collaboration sees the sports data solutions provider that is a part of EveryMatrix deliver data for the operator's new sportsbook</p>
<p>EveryMatrix announced that its data solution that delivers betting odds, scores, as well as real-time settlements for esports and sports events, OddsMatrix Sports Data Services, joined forces with the global gaming leader, Kindred. The recent collaboration comes ahead of the launch of the operator’s new proprietary sportsbook. Under the terms of the agreement, OddsMatrix agreed to power the leading operator’s sportsbook with current and historical sports data.</p>
<p>As a result, Kindred’s sportsbook will be able to access quality data for a variety of sports, including basketball, football, tennis and ice hockey, among others. Currently, sportsbooks require data that enables them to improve customer experiences. As a leading provider of such data and solutions, OddsMatrix will power Kindred’s new sportsbook and is expected to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>Known as a complete data solution that brings betting scores, odds and real-time settlements for esports and sports events, OddsMatrix is currently the choice of many leading sports betting operators. For years the company has collected real-time sports data, allowing its technology to bring unique odds and settlements that betting operators can leverage to their advantage and improve their offerings. Overall, last year, OddsMatrix covered more than 100 sports, offering 700 betting types across a staggering 1.5 million events.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, OddsMatrix announced the launch of Fast Markets. This launch came ahead of the upcoming soccer season, allowing the company’s partners to engage with their clients in real time with new betting options.</p>
<p>The Partnership Brings Excitement to Kindred, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Ben Colley, Kindred’s group head of trading, acknowledged that the company’s sportsbook needed historical and real-time data to generate the most accurate and innovative markets. “We’ve been really happy with what we’ve seen from OddsMatrix and our team of Quant Analysts and Data Scientists are now fully armed to take our internal R&amp;D work in the modeling space to the next level,” he added. Finally, Colley spoke about the importance of data feeds and technology in the development of an engaging product.</p>
<p>“In order to develop the most robust models to generate the most innovative and accurate markets, we needed both historical and a real-time provision of data of the highest possible resolution.“ Ben Colley, group head of trading at Kindred</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president of Americas, was similarly thrilled to see OddsMatrix join forces with Kindred. He explained that Kindred is a globally recognized and trusted operator that has a strong presence in different regulated gambling markets. Finally, Nyman added that EveryMatrix is excited to fuel the growth of Kindred’s sportsbook.</p>
