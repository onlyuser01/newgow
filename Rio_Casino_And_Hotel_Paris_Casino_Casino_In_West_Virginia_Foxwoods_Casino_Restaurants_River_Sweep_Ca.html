<p>Epoxy.ai, a company that provides AI-driven personalization solutions for sports leagues, betting companies, and affiliated businesses, has announced a new platform solution, iCasino, which is designed to bring powerful tailored solutions to the online casino sector.</p>
<p>The company leverages both AI and machine learning to build unique customizable experiences that lead to better engagement and more satisfying gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Partner operators who choose to leverage iCasino will also benefit from powerful insights and a proprietary analytics suite that will help them tap into actionable data that can be used to drive engagement, revenue and improve retention rates.</p>
<p>With iCasino, Epoxy.ai is looking to ensure that it offers a strong casino personalization that includes metadata analysis, mapping tools, and even tailored player bonuses that can lead to better engagement. Epoxy also has a comprehensive API that will allow iCasino to take full control over the player’s customer journey and add value to everything they experience on a partner operator brand.</p>
<p>Epoxy.ai Co-Founder and President Jason Angelides was similarly excited about this partnership and welcomed the opportunity to see iCasino launch. It’s what he described as the next logical step for his business and said that Epoxy was committed to continually expanding its offering and "driving differentiation" across industries and markets.</p>
<p>"With this new customizable solution, we are bringing the power of AI and ML to the iCasino industry, delivering a personalized, stylish, and engaging gaming experience that players will love," Angelides added.</p>
<p>iCasino is a powerful tool in operators’ arsenal as they can use it to configure player experiences based on user behavior. Personalization has become a buzzword in the industry and companies have been racing to harness its full potential.</p>
<p>Epoxy.ai has been a staunch supporter of AI when it comes to iGaming personalization. The company has spoken about the role that technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence will play in building tailored solutions in an era of changing and diverse consumer preferences.</p>
<p>Personalization pumps through the veins Epoxy.ai as Angelides who used to run a sports technology company that was bought by Comcast to help with the Comcast Pay TV business drive towards greater personalization and user engagement. Angelides is one of the torchbearers of this technology and he is keen to start afresh with iCasino in the online casino vertical.</p>
