<p>Head Into the Sunset</p>
<p>As the quest into the horizon begins, players will start to gradually notice the hidden features in the depths of the reels that have been designed by BF Games’ skilled team of designers.</p>
<p>While the wolves are busy guarding the American Mountains against all hunters and safeguarding the valuable prizes, players who turn into pathfinders must attempt to protect the lands from intruders and return the treasures to their rightful owners.</p>
<p>The expedition is prone to be memorable in the game with medium volatility, an engaging soundtrack, suitable sound effects, excellent animations, and overall entertaining gameplay.</p>
<p>The company’s product owner, Piotr Saluda, has expressed excitement regarding the release of the game that welcomes players on the thrilling mountain expedition while mentioning the excellent win potential of their freshest game that turns it into “an electrifying addition” to their continuously growing game portfolio.</p>
<p>In February, BF Games entered the Greek gaming market via Novibet, right after it was granted a license from Canada’s provincial regulator.</p>
<p>Flaming Skull Scatters, Free Games &amp; Mask Wilds</p>
<p>As players keep going up the towering peaks, they will come across the flaming Skull Scatter symbols that will trigger 10 Free Spins for a minimum of three matching symbols. Provided the Free Games feature is engaged, players receive 10 more Free Spins.</p>
<p>In case a winning combination is revealed while playing the Free Spins round, players are rewarded with a Respin round. During this round, the winning symbols will stay in their original positions throughout the round.</p>
<p>Provided players score a new win during the Respins, the winning symbols are once again stuck to the reels together with the previously landed symbols.</p>
<p>Besides replacing the standard game symbols, Mask Wilds multiply any winning combination they are a part of by up to 16x. The game also lets players instantly engage in the Free Spins game using the dedicated Buy Feature that costs 70x the base bet for 10 Free Games.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, BF Games announced it expanded its presence in Belgium by inking a partnership with PepperMill Casino.</p>
