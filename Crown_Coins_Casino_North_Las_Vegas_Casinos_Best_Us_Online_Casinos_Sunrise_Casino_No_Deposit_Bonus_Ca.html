    <h1>Crown Coins Casino North Las Vegas Casinos Best Us Online Casinos Sunrise Casino No Deposit Bonus Ca</h1>

<p>Dear Mr / Mrs</p>
<p>I am writing to file a complaint against Stake Casino (Stake.com).</p>
<p>The reasons for my complaint are that Stake's Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes are insufficient and violate licensing requirements and curacao law, specifically the NOIS (Attached) and regulations specified by the Curaçao Gaming Control Board. With the insufficient processes in place.</p>
<p>I was able to create an account from a banned jurisdiction (Italy)- My account is fully verified KYC using my Canadian documents (I am from Toronto, Ontario). In October 2022, stake banned players from Ontario due to the new Canadian laws, however, stake casino continued to allow me to access my account from ITALY WITHOUT a VPN because they knew that I am a degenerate whale and they would just take my money day after day, week after week and month after month.</p>
<p>I was able to deposit a significant amount of money over the course of just under 3 years. In total, my deposits would have to be tens of millions.</p>
<p>my overall loss on stake casino is just over $2,000,000 USD.</p>
<p>my losses since Ontario customers were banned in October 2022 are roughly $400,000 USD.</p>
<p>stake casino representatives and management have all been racist and extremely rude to be for the past two years but they have left my account active because they know that I will continue to lose money and lots of money.</p>
<p>I also have a video where the owner Eddie Craven and a support member Dusan both defamed me in front of thousands of customers watching the live stream back in 2022. I will also be pursuing legal action for this.</p>
<p>4.5 Stake will not accept registration from individuals:</p>
<p>a) Under 18 years old or under the legal age of majority or gambling in their jurisdiction;</p>
<p>b) Residing in jurisdictions from where it is illegal or gambling is not permitted. Stake is not able to verify the legality of the Service in each jurisdiction and it is the User's responsibility to ensure that their use of the Service is lawful;</p>
<p>JURISDICTIONS</p>
<p>14.3 Persons located in or reside in Afghanistan, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Côte d'Ivoire, Cuba, Curaçao, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Liberia, Libya, Lithuania, Netherlands, North Korea, Ontario, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, South Sudan, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Zimbabwe (the "Prohibited Jurisdictions") are not permitted make use of the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions on engaging in real-money play from Prohibited Jurisdictions applies equally to residents and citizens of other nations while located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent the restrictions on play by any persons located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction or Restricted Jurisdiction, is a breach of this Agreement. An attempt at circumvention includes, but is not limited to, manipulating the information used by Stake to identify your location and providing Stake with false or misleading information regarding your location or place of residence.</p>
<p>PROPOSED RESOLUTION:</p>
<p>I am looking to work out a refund of my net losses, thus leaving myself in the same position I have been in before I signed up with stake.com. due to the fact that stake.com has knowingly allowed a customer to play from a banned jurisdiction (Italy) and continued to let me play after October 2022 when Ontario customers were banned completely. even though my ID was verified as a Canadian from Ontario) they have broken many laws and also went against their license. I will also be reaching out to a lawyer and curaçao gaming.</p>
<p>I have attached a few photos of my total wager amounts and net losses in crypto.</p>
<p>I will also be contacting stake casino to get history or my sessions to prove that I was playing and accessing the site from Italy (I have been living in Italy since I opened my stake account)</p>
<p>I will provide more information as needed. Let’s start with this.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
