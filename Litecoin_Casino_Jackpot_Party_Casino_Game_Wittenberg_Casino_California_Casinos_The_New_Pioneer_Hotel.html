    <h1>Litecoin Casino Jackpot Party Casino Game Wittenberg Casino California Casinos The New Pioneer Hotel</h1>

<p>I opened an account on Rolleto, before making any deposit I sent the documents requested for account verification. After seeing that they were verified, I started to deposit and play.</p>
<p>I tried to make a withdrawal of €75, it was rejected, they sent me an email saying that I had to send a selfie with my data written on paper and an identification document, I sent it however they replied that it was not visible and that I had to be handwritten, I resent again as they asked.</p>
<p>At that time I already had €160 in the account and I made a withdrawal request for €160.</p>
<p>I received an email confirming that I had passed the verification process.</p>
<p>I waited, as I still didn't receive it, I got in touch with support via livechat, where I was confirmed that I was verified, but I had to wait because they processed payments for up to 3 business days.</p>
<p>Today, December 29th, the survey was rejected again, they didn't send me any explanation, I got in touch with the livechat who told me I had to send the selfie again. It doesn't make any sense, if I'm already confirmed, if I've sent the selfie that was analyzed and verified, the only sense it makes is the obvious desire of not wanting to pay.</p>
