<p>Stake.com continues to expand its global reach, whilst increasing its customer offering in the United Kingdom. The leading cryptocurrency platform has been able to negotiate a new partnership with Swindon Town FC, becoming the official shirt sleeve sponsor for the Emirates FA Cup Third Round against Manchester City on Friday, January 7.</p>
<p>Stake.com Starts to Build Its Presence in British Sports</p>
<p>The match will be definitely worth tuning in to, and Stake.com is no doubt looking to strategically push its name in the public eye by teaming up with established sports franchises in the United Kingdom. Manchester City will be traveling to The County Ground, where Swindon Town will play host.</p>
<p>The game day shirts will sport the Stake.com signage with the event televised on ITV1. The League Two team is hoping to take on one of the best soccer clubs in the country and uncontested Premier League powerhouse in the match at the end of the workweek.</p>
<p>According to Stake.com sponsorships manager Dominic Rae, the company is happy to be joining Swindon Town FC for the upcoming match day, which is described as a “David vs Goliath FA Cup encounter.”</p>
<p>“At Stake.com we love an underdog story and look forward to playing our part in supporting the club as they bid to pull off one of the biggest FA Cup giant-killings of all time.” Stake.com sponsorships manager Dominic Rae</p>
<p>Swindon Town FC head of commercial Danny Lee spoke just as favorably about the upcoming match. “We are delighted to welcome onboard Stake.com,” he said, adding that the platform was one of the most innovative brands in its space, and the club was looking forward to collaborating with it well beyond the most recently negotiated arrangement.</p>
<p>The partnership comes less than a month after Stake.com announced that it’s all systems go in the UK, receiving the formal green light from the regulator. Partnering with local soccer clubs is just the beginning as the company will be trying to expand its footprint.</p>
