<p>Rivalry Corp. is on a roll and the roll does not stop with one license or successful monthly and quarterly results. The company, which strives to be a globally recognized sports betting and media platform, has secured a license by the Northern Territory Racing Commission in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia Marks Important Market Entry for Rivalry</p>
<p>As a result, Rivalry may launch a sports betting platform in the territory and expand its offer to yet another geographical region. The license is not restricted to a single territory but effectively allows Rivalry to host sports betting operations in the entirety of the country.</p>
<p>This marks another important milestone for Rivalry’s operations. Company chief executive and co-founder Steven Salz commented:</p>
<p>“Expansion into regulated markets across the globe is a key part of our growth strategy, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to officially receive our license for Australia.” Company chief executive and co-founder Steven Salz</p>
<p>Australia’s own culture and love for sports and gaming is a great fit with Rivalry’s own brand identity, Salz explained. Entering into a new jurisdiction and operating under a different set of legal prerequisites also demonstrates Rivalry’s ability to comply with international laws, Salz concluded.</p>
<p>Rivalry is not just a sports betting company. In fact, Rivalry started as an esports-centric platform that gathered momentum and managed to stay profitable while it was focusing on building its technological offer. Once there, the company announced plans to expand into the casino and sports betting segments.</p>
<p>Catering to Younger Generations and Next Gen Betting</p>
<p>A hallmark of Rivalry’s offer is its focus on Millennial and Gen Z demographics, and a next-gen experience altogether. Rivalry is specializing in creating tailored experiences that have not been fully available in markets the company currently operates in.</p>
<p>Rivalry has mostly focused on operating internationally, owing to its Isle of Man license, but the company has made definitive strides to secure licenses in locally-regulated jurisdictions such as Ontario and now Australia.</p>
<p>This is another proof that the company has been able to operate worldwide while complying with some of the strictest industry guidelines, enough to qualify Rivalry for swift market entry in some of the most lucrative if heavily regulated markets. Australia and Ontario, and by extension Canada, are tipped to be some of the biggest gambling markets.</p>
<p>In fact, Australia is the most valuable betting market per capita, Rivalry said in a press release, citing a survey published in The Economist.</p>
