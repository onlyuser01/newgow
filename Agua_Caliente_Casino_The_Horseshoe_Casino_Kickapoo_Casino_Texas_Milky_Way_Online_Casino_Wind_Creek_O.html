    <h1>Agua Caliente Casino The Horseshoe Casino Kickapoo Casino Texas Milky Way Online Casino Wind Creek O</h1>

<p>Supplier of technology and solutions to the global gaming industry International Game Technology (IGT) announced it has signed a new PlaySports technology agreement with sports betting operator Betfred.</p>
<p>Experienced Team, Proven Technology</p>
<p>The new multi-year partnership will see Betfred enter the Nevada betting market by leveraging IGT’s PlaySports solution to power sports betting operations at the Mohegan Sun Sportsbook inside Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, part of Curio Collection by Hilton.</p>
<p>“IGT PlaySports’ remarkable reputation and influence in the US sports betting market, coupled with their ability to navigate complex regulatory environments, give Betfred supreme confidence in our choice to partner with IGT in Nevada,” said the chief operating officer of Betfred USA Sports, Bryan Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett also hailed the “experienced, in-market team and proven technology” utilized by IGT’s PlaySports that will help Betfred create “a competitive and engaging betting experience” in the world’s most exciting gaming destination and give the option to scale operations by pursuing additional market opportunities.</p>
<p>The retail sportsbook at Mohegan Sun will be the first Betfred sportsbook in the US powered by IGT’s PlaySports technology, and while the partnership will start with retail sports betting, Betfred intends to launch a PlaySports-powered mobile sportsbook in the future.</p>
<p>Sportsbook to Appeal to Fans and Visitors</p>
<p>Joe Asher, president of Sports Betting at IGT, also commented on the partnership with Betfred, stressing the influence Fred Done had on the final decision to partner with the betting operator. He outlined that he had personally attended the recent Nevada Gaming Control Board hearing to be able to see the owner of the UK-based sports betting operator.</p>
<p>“He is a legend in bookmaking and Betfred is one of the most legendary brands in the sports betting industry,” Asher said about Done and his sportsbook brand, feeling honored “to work with Fred’s team in the US and they introduce the Betfred product in Nevada” and help the brand to “create a successful sportsbook that will appeal to local sports fans and visitors alike.”</p>
<p>Providing sports betting solutions to power more than 80 gaming venues across the US and Canada, IGT’s recent partnership with Betfred is set to further expand the technology supplier’s footprint in the sports betting market in Nevada.</p>
<p>Last month, IGT signed an agreement with UBetOhio and deployed its PlaySports QuickBet Kiosks at restaurants and bars across Ohio and further announced that its PlaySports Pad would follow suit with deployment in the coming months.</p>
<p>In Europe, IGT extended its contract with Société de la Loterie de la Suisse Romande to continue to power the lottery operator with its world-class lottery technology until 2031.</p>
