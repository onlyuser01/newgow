    <h1>Buffalo Thunder Resort Casino Photos Casinos In Montana Usa Harrah S Casino Kansas City Missouri Cas</h1>

<p>So I actually starting using this casino because of the high reviews given on this site. But I have to say this casino has major MAJOR withdrawa issues. So I’m trying to process my first withdrawal, in order to do so needed to send in a whole lot of docs. More than many other casinos that I play with. But that’s fine. I understand and kind of respect that. But then was told that I need to wait up to 4 business days for them to be reviewed. that seemed terribly wrong but it said up to, so I thought ok we will see. I sent my docs in on a thursday morning. I made sure to send in all required docs. I checked back with the casino 2 times each after a couple days, but they kept saying up to 4 business days, so literally on Wensday wich was 6 days later and 4 buisnes days later I got a response saying I needed to resend my credit card pic. All because I highlighted the middle 8 numbers. I was only supposed to highlight the middle 6 numbers! Bu this is the thing, with the original docs they require you to send in a credit authorization form. Which you right all the digits and everything. Nonetheless I resent my credit card pic with in an hour of receiving that very email. But guess what? Now I’m being told I need to wait another 4 buisness days! Which makes no sense to me, i mean I sent the reply email with in an hour of saying they needed it! but its crazy because i know rather than it taking up to 4 Buisness days that they will make sure it does take 4 business days. but now I’m afraid that they will make up another excuse to delay the process. Now the kicker of this whole story is it’s over $125! Lol. I always ALWAYS process a small withdrawal with any casino I’m thinking of using to see if I will use them again. I literally gamble between 50-60K a month. So its just a test really to see if the casino is trustable. so now they possibly lost a customer over this small amount. I say possibly because I’m still willing to see how this is handled as I called in today but it did not look promising to be honest. THE WITHDRAWAL PROCESS SO FAR HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF FUSTRATING AND NONCALLED FOR TIME LENGTHS</p>
