<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a developer of best-in-class iGaming titles, has penned an Ontario-facing agreement with BetMGM. Ontario, which Hacksaw defined as “Canada’s digital iGaming hotbed,” is a major target market for the provider.</p>
<p>As per the deal between the two companies, Hacksaw Gaming will supply its new partner with some of its best games. This will include hit titles such as Wanted Dead or A Wild and R.I.P. City, which are now both available to BetMGM Ontario players.</p>

<p>The launch with BetMGM Ontario is a move that will help Hacksaw Gaming reinforce its presence in Ontario and North America as a whole. BetMGM is notably the eighth Ontarian operator Hacksaw Gaming has an agreement with.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming Thrilled to Expand in Ontario</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s chief commercial officer, Gabrielle Star, released a statement on the new deal, exclaiming that her team is looking forward to working with BetMGM. Star lauded the operator as a “true industry mainstay” and a “household name” with a rich history in retail and online gambling.</p>
<p>For the provider, this deal is an opportunity to further expand in Ontario and reach more local players with its content.</p>
<p>We continue to aim high with plans to expand into even more regulated territories as part of our overarching global strategy this year and beyond. Gabrielle Star, CCO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>The Supplier Is on a Roll</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming was founded in 2018 and supplies iGaming content to the online casino industry. The company’s vision is to disrupt the market through innovative, user-driven technology.</p>
<p>Currently, Hacksaw has a presence in more than 20 regulated markets across the world, including the United Kingdom, Malta, Italy, Germany, Ontario, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Romania and West Virginia, among others.</p>
<p>In other Hacksaw-related news, last month, the company secured a B2B license in Sweden, further expanding the scope of its operations. The license, provided by the Swedish Gambling Authority, not only allowed the company to enter a new market but also helped it consolidate its European footprint as a whole.</p>
<p>A week earlier than that, the provider signed a partnership agreement with Sisal, a leading Italian operator. The agreement, in line with Hacksaw’s expansion strategy, allowed it to team up with another “household name,” ensuring that its content will reach local gamblers.</p>
