<p>Kambi Group has acquired Shape Games, a front-end specialist, which will significantly boost the company’s capability to deliver engaging sports betting experiences. The upfront consideration of the acquisition is set at €38.5 million ($38.47 million), and the deal comes with a performance-related earnout up to €39.6 million ($39.57 million), which puts the potential total value of the deal at €78.1 million ($78.03 million), all of which will be settled in cash.</p>
<p>Kambi Group Secures Important Front-End Specialist Acquisition</p>
<p>Shape Games has earned a reputation as being one of the most successful front-end developers capable of driving strong customer engagement and retention through customizable and native technology. The company, which is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, focuses on working with leading markets in regulated markets exclusively. Kambi co-founder and CEO Kristian Nylen were excited about this opportunity and what it signified for the company:</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how their technology enables operators to extract the full value of the Kambi sportsbook and provides the level of control operators require to deliver bespoke experiences to their players. Kambi co-founder and CEO Kristian Nylen</p>
<p>Shape Games has teamed up with state-backed operators such as Danske Spil and Norsk Tipping, demonstrating the trust and respect the company enjoys in the industry. Apart from that, Shape Games has already worked with Kambi through BetWarriors and JACK Entertainment.</p>
<p>This acquisition puts Kambi is a unique opportunity to strengthen its own grasp of front-end development technology and result in better sportsbook turnover by driving customer acquisition and retention. Shape Games has an advanced technological stack that provides the whole shebang – from the front-end tech to the ancillary engagement capabilities, such as loyalty, statistics, free-to-play games, personalized offerings based on player preference, and more.</p>
<p>Shape Games to Also Continue Delivering Products in Standalone Capacity</p>
<p>Shape Games CEO and co-founder Christian Risom was equally pleased with the opportunity and said that the company was happy to be joining forces with Kambi. He added:</p>
<p>Together we will have unmatched sports betting and casino offering for any market in the world, be it on mobile and web or in retail. Kambi’s modular approach to the market allows us to form a profound and tight-knit integration with their sportsbook all the while pursuing opportunities with other sportsbook partners. Shape Games CEO and co-founder Christian Risom</p>
<p>All of this provides operators and partner companies with the opportunity to drive incremental revenue in a sustainable matter. Kambi is also benefiting from another factor, as the company now has improved excellence in the sports betting value chain, and it can deliver on the expected high-quality solutions through turnkey and modularized packages. Shape Games will continue to provide services independently but also as part of Kambi, which will in turn benefit Kambi’s current and future partners.</p>
