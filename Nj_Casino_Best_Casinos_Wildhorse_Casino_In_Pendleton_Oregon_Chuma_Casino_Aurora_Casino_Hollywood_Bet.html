    <h1>Nj Casino Best Casinos Wildhorse Casino In Pendleton Oregon Chuma Casino Aurora Casino Hollywood Bet</h1>

<p>Dear, Borislav</p>
<p>We analyzed the situation you described.</p>
<p>This player's account has been banned for violating our site's terms and conditions by using multiple accounts. Article 4.1.9. of our Terms said, that creating multiple accounts for the purpose of collusion, fraud, Service abuse, and/or any kind of Service manipulation is prohibited and may result in account closure.</p>
<p>Article 5.4 of our Terms said, that only allowed to register one Account with the Service. Accounts are subject to immediate closure if it is found that you have multiple Accounts registered with us. This includes the use of representatives, relatives, associates, affiliates, related parties, connected persons, and/or third parties operating on your behalf.</p>
<p>This player has more than two accounts. In communication with our support manager, he said that he has multiple accounts. One is s<strong><em>*</em>*@gmail.com. Other is k</strong>****@gmail.com</p>
<p>Account s<strong>*</strong>*@gmail.com has been registered earlier. The information that the user could not reset the password does not correspond to the truth, because on 27.11 he reset the password on this account. The last login to the account was dated 12/10. The user contacted the support department with a request to block his account on 12/12/2022.</p>
<p>Account k<strong>*</strong>*@gmail.com has been registered 09/12 and was blocked due to a violation of clauses 4.1.9 and 5.4. of our Terms.</p>
<p>In communication with the player, he was informed that his account was blocked because he violated the rules. The account created later and not selected as the main account by the player was blocked.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
