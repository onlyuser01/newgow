    <h1>Casino Empire What To Wear To A Casino Lytton Casino San Pablo Plaza Casino And Hotel Swinomish Casi</h1>

<p>Enclosed my e-mail to the casino from which the facts emerge.</p>
<p>I have - of course - agreed a deposit limit, which was simply ignored by the casino or was simply continued to be debited.</p>
<p>The original argument (in the live chat) of the casino was that the withdrawals were made with a time delay. This is simply wrong (I have the receipts from my bank for that).</p>
<p>There has been no response to my e-mail to the casino, with all receipts and proofs!</p>
<p>It cannot be that you agree a limit and then see on the bank account that a multiple has been debited and that this leads to existential fears.</p>
<p>e-mail to the casino:</p>
<p>As a self-protection, I have agreed with you a weekly deposit limit of EUR 1,500 for my Quatro Casino account!</p>
<p>As one of your colleagues already communicated in the "chat", you did not adhere to the limit for reasons unknown to me!</p>
<p>Basically, I pay in such a way that it only goes up to a certain limit so that I don't get into financial difficulties. I have it now that you have withdrawn beyond my agreed limit.</p>
<p>I therefore request an opinion or a solution to the problem!</p>
<p>The following documents / debit confirmations will be sent:</p>
<p>November 12th, 2021: 3x EUR 200, -</p>
<p>1x EUR 100, -</p>
<p>November 15, 2021: 2x EUR 200, -</p>
<p>4x EUR 100, -</p>
<p>November 19, 2021: 8x EUR 200, -</p>
<p>Thus, at least in the calendar week 15.11. - 21.11.2021 a total of EUR 2,400 (!!!) instead of the limit of EUR 1,500, - debited !!</p>
