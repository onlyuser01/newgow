    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Foxwoods Casino In Connecticut Wild Horse Pass And C</h1>

<p>July marked a historical moment for the Las Vegas Strip as this month records a record in gaming revenue. The main factors that contributed to this incredible milestone are the opening of the Allegiant Stadium and Resorts World Las Vegas for their first month. Additionally, several entertainment venues were reopened and managed to bring 3.3 million visitors to Sin City. That marks the strongest showing since the start of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Gaming revenue records were set before Nevada reinstituted a mandate on wearing masks while indoors. The rule was brought back to fight the increased number of infections and it became effective on July 30. However, it is interesting to mention that casino operators stated during earnings calls at the end of July and beginning of August that, going forward, they do not expect their businesses to slow down because of the mandate.</p>
<p>July is now Nevada’s fifth consecutive month in which the gaming revenue has topped $1 billion. In this month, the total revenue that the state recorded was $1.35 billion. That is an increase from the $1.19 billion gaming revenue in June and the $1.23 billion revenue that was recorded in May, which was a record at the time.</p>
<p>Revenues Shattered Records That Lasted Over A Decade</p>
<p>According to Michal Lawton, a Nevada Gaming Control Board senior research analyst, the last time when revenues of this magnitude occurred was from December 2007 to April 2008. The most impressive statistic, however, was the Strip’s gaming revenue in July, which was $793.7 million. That is an increase of 46.5% compared to July 2019. During this month, two years ago, the pandemic was not a factor and the recorded revenue was $541.8 million.</p>
<p>The prior high for the Strip’s showing, which was set in February, was also exceeded. Deutsche Bank stated that it was increased by 14% or approximately $100 million. Resorts World Las Vegas (RWLV) also opened its doors for visitors on June 24.</p>
<p>Compared to June’s gross-gaming-revenue-per-day basis, the revenue increased by 25.8% and the revenue that the Strip made increase by 30% from $610.6 million.</p>
<p>July Was a Perfect Storm</p>
<p>Lawton stated that in terms of the special events at the Allegiant Stadium, July couldn’t be better for gaming. Additionally, the month had five weekends. This was the first full month in which RWLV operated fully, but also a month that recorded an increased play and high hold in baccarat by international guests. The opening of Resorts World was long overdue.</p>
<p>He added that these milestones are also backed by other factors such as the return of leisure travel, demand, and healthy consumers thanks to the stimulus.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported that the number of visitors in July (3.3 million) surpassed the number of visitors in May (2.97 million). Compared to July 2019, a month that resulted in 3.68 million, the number dropped by just 10%.</p>
<p>During the weekends, hotel occupancy was over 88%, while the occupancy throughout the month was at 80%. Compared to July 2019, the monthly occupancy was 91%, while the occupancy during weekends was 97%.</p>
<p>Since the demand was higher, that also meant that the prices would go up. In July, the average rate for a daily room was $152.13, while in June, the rate was $127.90. The LVCVA stated that the room rate in July was around 20% higher than the one in June.</p>
<p>As for the revenue per available room, it increased by 24.4% compared to June as it was $120.79, but it was also higher than the one of July 2019. In July 2019, the revenue was $115.62, meaning that 2021’s revenue was 4.5% higher.</p>
<p>As for the special events, Lawton named the reopening of the Park MGM residency of Bruno Mars and his July 3 performance, Gareth Brooks performance at Allegiant Stadium on July 10, the show “O” of Cirque Du Soleil, which returned on July 1 at the Bellagio, UFC 264, which featured Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirer, Usher’s residency at Caesar’s Palace Colosseum on July 16, and the Gold Cup final between the US and Mexico which took place at the Allegiant Stadium on August 1.</p>

Their revenue in July 2021 was $240.8 million and, compared to July 2019’s $212.2 million, it is a 13.4% increase. However, it is lower than the $269.8 million revenue made in June 2020.</p>
