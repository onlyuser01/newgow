    <h1>Atlantic City Casino Map Hard Rock Casino Florida Chukchansi Casino Palm Springs Hotel And Casino Io</h1>

<p>FSB, a supplier and provider of iGaming and sports betting solutions, announced this morning that it is extending its partnership with Fitzdares, a UK-based award-winning sports betting brand. The pair first started working together in 2019 and Fitzdares is a recognized name in the UK market.</p>
<p>Fitzdares Breaks Ground in Ontario</p>
<p>As a result of their partnership extension, Fitzdares will be able to continue delivering on the unique content and solutions that have helped shape the industry and gain a competitive edge over rivals.</p>
<p>Fitzdares prioritizes customer experience by delivering highly sought-after games that strike home with its audiences. The sportsbook is powered by FSB’s proprietary platform which guarantees smoothness of the experience, with Fitzdares recently expanding in the newly-regulated Ontario gambling market.</p>
<p>Because of the successful launch of the sportsbook overseas, Fitzdares and FSB are interested in continuing to work together and remain long-term partners. On the back of this development, FSB is also actively looking to bolster its presence in central Europe, after the company signed a partnership with the Hungarian National Lottery.</p>
<p>Both Companies Happy with Results So Far</p>
<p>Commenting on the most recent string of successes, FSB COO Glenn Elliott welcomed the opportunities that have opened up ahead of the company. Elliott further said that FSB was pleased to continue building up on the company’s partnership with Fitzdares and explore new markets:</p>
<p>We’ve collaborated closely over the last three years with Fitzdares to curate a multi-layered product for them that resonates with their unique client base. FSB COO Glenn Elliott</p>
<p>The news was met in a similar fashion by Fitzdares CEO William Woodhams who said that FSB’s support has been instrumental in ensuring that the sportsbook gets to where it is today. He described the relationship with the company as “rock solid” and said that the company was looking forward to continuing collaborating with FSB in key markets such as Ontario, the United Kingdom, and any new opportunity that comes next.</p>
