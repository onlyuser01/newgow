    <h1>Chicago Casinos Luxor Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Railroad Pass Hotel And Casino Belle Of Baton Rouge</h1>

<p>Bally’s has announced a pair of appointments that are designed to strengthen the company’s global team and its operations</p>
<p>The first appointment comes in the face of Don Westcott who will now step in as SVP, global chief compliance officer. Westcott is a compliance veteran who has more than 25 years of relevant experience.</p>
<p>Bringing the Right People for the Job</p>
<p>He has worked in both the gaming and financial industries and knows his way around pressing and important aspects of regulation. He has worked with Fiserv, First Data, and Nuvei, and other companies, being keenly involved in their financial and compliance operations.</p>
<p>Cutting his teeth in the gambling industry, Westcott’s portfolio is actually far more impressive, and it includes stints and positions at Isle of Capri Casinos, Caesars Entertainment, Osage Casinos, and more.</p>
<p>The other prominent hire for Bally’s is Tammi Barlow who will serve as inaugural VP of global responsibility and social impact, as the company’s doubling down its efforts to ensure that it meets a higher level of responsibility in the sector.</p>
<p>Much like Westcott, Barlow is a well-seasoned veteran with a solid standing in the industry. She used to work at Rush Street Interactive where she was in charge of corporate social responsibility strategy. Her efforts focused on the company’s inclusion, diversity, and equity programs.</p>
<p>She also served on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee for Global Gaming Women and is currently the chairwoman of the Responsible Gaming Committee. Both hires have been hailed by the company, which is determined to strengthen its commitment to various causes and operations.</p>
<p>Strengthening Equality and Diversity at the Heart of Bally’s</p>
<p>Bally’s chief legal officer and EVP, Kim M. Barker, was among the company’s high-ranking officials to welcome the appointment of the two new specialists and said:</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire leadership team, I am pleased to welcome Don and Tammi to Bally’s. Their deep expertise enables Bally’s to continue our progress toward building industry-leading compliance, responsible gaming and social impact functions as the Company continues to grow and expand. Bally’s chief legal officer and EVP, Kim M. Barker</p>
<p>Apart from leading the world’s most formidable land-based gambling brand, Bally’s has also been investing heavily in strengthening its presence in interactive markets. The company has teamed up with Pragmatic Play and White Hat to strengthen its online gaming presence over the past months.</p>
