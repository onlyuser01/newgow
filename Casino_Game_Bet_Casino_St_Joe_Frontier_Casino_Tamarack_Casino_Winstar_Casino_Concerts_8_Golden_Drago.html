<p>8 Golden Dragon Challenge review</p>
<p>8 Golden Dragon Challenge is themed around Chinese cultural imagery.</p>
<p>Players will wander through a grove of cherry trees and discover a mysterious temple. Inside, a range of friendly dragons await, along with more than a little gold.</p>
<p>Players who enjoy East Asian cultural themes will particularly enjoy this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of 8 Golden Dragon Challenge has a traditional Chinese feel with plenty of string and flute notes. The reels spin with a bell-like sound and during wins, a gong sound can be heard.</p>
<p>The reels can be seen within an ornately decorated building with golden coins on either side. Each reel is separated by gold and adorned with entwined emblems.</p>
<p>In the background, players will glimpse an idyllic landscape of blooming cherry trees. The crisp blue sky and subtle mist give this slot a dreamy look.</p>
<p>The titular dragons appear on the reels in shades of red, blue, green, and gold. Each one has an elegantly curved body and an enigmatic face. Despite their formidable nature, the intention of these dragons seems to be kind.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of the 8 Golden Dragon Challenge creates an entertaining fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>8 Golden Dragon Challenge is a five-reel, three-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The Ante Bet feature allows players to select a bet multiplier which can change the behavior of the game. A bet multiplier of 15x will naturally increase the player’s odds of triggering the Bonus.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Bonus for 100x their current total bet.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5. If players land 3 Scatter symbols, the Mini Slot Machine Bonus begins.</p>

<p>The Envelope Bonus begins if any mini slot lands a winning combination that includes a full Dragon symbol. A multiplier of 1x is added to the round for a single full Dragon symbol, and 3x for two full Dragon symbols.</p>
<p>The Envelope Bonus begins with 8 envelopes which open to display random prizes ranging from 2x to 10x the player’s total bet.</p>
