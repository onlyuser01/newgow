<p>Asian Pioneer takes a hit in Q1 results</p>
<p>The company will debut new EGM games</p>
<p>APE is looking to expand in the SEA region</p>
<p>Amid an improving business environment for Macau’s gambling operators, Asian Pioneer Entertainment (APE) is bringing even more innovation to the table with new electronic gaming equipment and games.</p>
<p>Asian Pioneer Introduces New EGM Games</p>
<p>Macau-headquartered Asian Pioneer Entertainment (API) has revealed plans to expand its own portfolio of EGT games. As one of the premier distributors of gaming machines in Macau, the company is in a unique position to scale its offer.</p>
<p>Despite a slightly turbulent Q1, in which the company posted a $244,000 loss, APE is determined to continue and diversify its portfolio, looking into new products and verticals to operate in.</p>
<p>The company has been specifically affected by slow-down in Distribution of Electronic Gaming Equipment and Technical Sales. To brush up on its offer, the company is planning to reveal a number of new gaming solutions at G2E Asia 2019.</p>
<p>APE is planning on a number of exciting new products, including new jackpot slot machines that operate in a network as well as virtual blackjack which will target Southeast Asia (SEA)players specifically. Some of the solution that APE is bringing forth include:</p>
<p>Karma Virtual Blackjack</p>
<p>Bao Ni Fa Jackpot Link</p>
<p>Fortune Totems</p>
<p>Abundant Fortune &amp; more</p>
<p>The company will collaborate with a number of established manufacturers, including Jumbo, Konami, Spintec, and Transact. The full list of products and innovation planned by APE can be seen in company’s official press release.</p>
<p>Research &amp; Development Despite the Slowdown</p>
<p>APE remains focused on keeping its leadership position as a distributor in Macau and now the entire SEA region. To do that, the company will have “to develop suitable games that may attract Southeast Asia players and customers.”</p>
<p>The company remains optimistic about its future prospect as APE is already in talks with several potential customers who are only now exploring Macau as a possible market.</p>
<p>Regarding the drop in financial results, APE argued that the losses posted in Q1 can be easily caught up to by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>“Management is confident that the group’s loss in the period can be reversed with new orders in the pipeline for the remainder of 2019,” the company noted.</p>
<p>While certain challenges from the past continue to hunt the operational results of APE even in 2019,the company feels confident about gradually expanding its clout across Asia.</p>
