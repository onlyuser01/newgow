    <h1>New Las Vegas Casino River City Casino In St Louis Games Like Cashman Casino Parx Casino Racing Entr</h1>

<p>Gambling technology company Playtech announced its casino software roll out in New Jersey will expand into BetMGM’s gaming network in the state. BetMGM Casino, Borgata Online and PartyCasino NJ will all feature Playtech’s online casino software under the agreement between the technology provider and the joint venture of MGM Resorts and GVC Holdings.</p>
<p>Playtech Continue to Expand Its Product Reach</p>
<p>Playtech made its debut in New Jersey in August when it launched its portfolio of online games via its long-term strategic partner Bet365, after a regulatory approval was granted in June. Now, the technology provider is expanding its reach in the Garden State through BetMGM. The deal also allows for similar roll out in other states where BetMGM is present.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to launch with leading operator BetMGM in New Jersey. This is the exciting first step in our partnership which will see us launch in further states with BetMGM across its industry leading portfolio of brands as it expands on its US leadership.” Shimon Akad, COO, Playtech</p>
<p>Playtech’s COO further outlined that the strategic deal with BetMGM demonstrated the strength of the company’s product offering and its appeal in the region, a significant step in Playtech’s efforts to build its pipeline of new licensees.</p>
<p>BetMGM’s Interest in Online and Live Casino</p>
<p>Roar Digital’s sports betting brand BetMGM has been present in New Jersey for a year after it successfully launched its online and mobile sports wagering app in September 2019. In August 2020, BetMGM made a significant step to expand into the online casino space by partnering with Evolution Gaming to provide live casino games.</p>
<p>“Our online casino customers in New Jersey will now be able to enjoy casino games from one of the World’s leading suppliers of gambling software. This launch continues to build on our current leadership position in Gaming in New Jersey and we look forward to continue collaborating with Playtech as more states in the US legalize online casino gaming.” Matthew Sunderland, Vice President, Gaming, BetMGM</p>
<p>The launch of online casino in the Garden State for BetMGM followed a similar one in West Virginia, where the sports betting brand started operating in August under the license held by the Greenbrier Resort, a mountain luxury resort known for its hospitality.</p>
<p>For Playtech, the launch with BetMGM demonstrates a significant step for the growth of the technology provider company in the US market, as it looks to further enter into other jurisdictions in the near future.</p>
