<p>Evolution Rolls out Live Casino Portfolio with Caesars in PA</p>
<p>Evolution, a leader of live casino solutions, has launched its portfolio of live casino games in Pennsylvania, a key market that adds to the company’s growth momentum in the US market.</p>
<p>Partnering with Caesars Casino &amp; Sportsbook through Caesars Entertainment, Inc., the company is now able to provide Caesars players in the Keystone State with quality live gaming products, including traditional casino games and game shows, which are held in high regard by players in markets all over the world.</p>
<p>The products are all powered out of the company’s dedicated live studios. Evolution has been doubling its efforts in expanding studio capacity in the United States, anticipating higher demand.</p>
<p>Now, the company will also roll out games with Caesars in New Jersey, the official statement said. Caesars’ Keystone State operations now support both desktop and mobile live casino games by Evolution.</p>
<p>Executives Take the Partnership with Optimism</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Evolution Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), Johan Nordstrom, had this to say:</p>
<p>“We are very proud indeed to be working with one of the biggest and most iconic brand names in the casino world. We look forward to helping Caesars achieve their goals in the enormously exciting U.S. gaming market and beyond.”</p>
<p>Caesars Sports and Online Gaming Chief, Christian Stuart, also spoke on the occasion. He said that the company is now confident in the future of iGaming and noting that it’s important to continue and deliver a type of product that consumers expect from the company.</p>
<p>“We’re excited for players to experience the fun and action of playing at a live casino table, from your home or anywhere in Pennsylvania,” Stuart added. Evolution has been very active throughout the United States, signing off on a series of milestone partnerships.</p>
<p>The company inked an agreement with FanDuel Group and it negotiated separate agreements with DraftKings and Rush Street Interactive. The company has been busy in the Americas as well, with a pivotal entry into Colombia.</p>
<p>Evolution posted strong third-quarter results and struck an online casino partnership with Wynn in October.</p>
