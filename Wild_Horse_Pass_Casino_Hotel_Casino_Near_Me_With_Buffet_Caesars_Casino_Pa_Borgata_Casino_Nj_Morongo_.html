    <h1>Wild Horse Pass Casino Hotel Casino Near Me With Buffet Caesars Casino Pa Borgata Casino Nj Morongo</h1>

<p>Supplier of gaming technology International Game Technology (IGT) announced it entered into a new multi-year agreement with Puerto Rico-based entertainment brand WinIn.</p>
<p>Partnership Imbued with Potential</p>
<p>The partnership agreement across sports betting technology and services with The Stadium LLC, the company operating the WinIn brand, expanded sports betting opportunities for IGT and its PlaySports solution for sportsbook operators via existing partnerships of WinIn with leading esports companies and the top-flight baseball league in the region, Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente.</p>
<p>The baseball league already announced plans to expand into the recently regulated sports betting market in Puerto Rico, while the deal with WinIn ensures IGT PlaySports technology and trading services to power all of the brand’s future online and retail sports betting operations.</p>
<p>As the sports betting market in Puerto Rico takes shape, WinIn is well-positioned to deliver world-class online and retail sports betting thanks to our technology and services partnership with IGT. IGT’s PlaySports platform continues to prove its capacity to scale with new market opportunities and give players a seamless omnichannel experience that they can trust.” Grace Santana, Chief Operating Officer, WinIn</p>
<p>Speaking about the new multi-year agreement with the Puerto Rico-based brand, IGT President of Sports Betting Joe Asher, a former CEO of William Hill US who was recently hired by IGT to spearhead PlaySports expansion efforts in North American and Latin American markets, outlined the high degree of expertise and experience IGT brings to its partners, helping them to “successfully establish competitive sportsbooks in newly regulated jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>The prospect of adding Puerto Rico as a territory with PlaySports-powered sportsbooks is another exciting step in our effort to further expand our footprint across North America.” Joe Asher, President of Sports Betting, North America, IGT</p>
<p>Affirm Sports Betting and Gaming Position</p>
<p>IGT PlaySports sports betting platform is part of the newly-established Digital &amp; Betting division following a business restructuring at the global supplier of gaming solutions across all verticals.</p>
<p>The restructuring was implemented to better reflect IGT’s leading role in the online casino gaming and sports betting space as both gaming verticals are expected to continue to grow. The restructuring did not affect IGT’s iLottery business, which remained under the company’s Global Lottery segment.</p>
<p>Comprising with IGT online casino and betting businesses, the division managed by former SVP of PlayDigital Enrico Drago will begin reporting financial results from the third quarter of 2021. In August, the global supplier of sports betting and gaming solutions revealed its performance in the second quarter of 2021 reached pre-pandemic levels.</p>
