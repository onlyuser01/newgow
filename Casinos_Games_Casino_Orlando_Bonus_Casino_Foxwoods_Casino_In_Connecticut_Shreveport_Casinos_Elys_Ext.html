<p>Elys Game Technology announced that it extended its collaboration with the Isleta Resort and Casino earlier this week.</p>
<p>Elys Inks Partnership Extension with Isleta Resort and Casino</p>
<p>Interactive gaming and sports betting technology company, Elys Game Technology, announced Wednesday that it extended its deal with the Isleta Resort and Casino located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Under the terms of the extended agreement, Elys’ subsidiary USBookmaking will continue to offer its sports wagering services for Isleta’s sportsbook.</p>
<p>Visitors of the resort can enjoy a sportsbook as well as self-service kiosks and in-person ticket counters throughout the venue serviced by USBookmaking. The sportsbooks enables bettors to place a variety of wagers on NBA, MLB, NFL, college football and basketball games.</p>
<p>The Company Remains Focused on Growing</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes at a time when Elys continues to expand its presence. In fact, last month, the company revealed that the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming, Regulation and Oversight Division approved the expansion of its Grand Central Restaurant and Sportsbook located in Washington. As a result, the company increased the number of self-service kiosks and window terminals available for the bettors.</p>
<p>Before that, in January, seeking to expand into New Jersey, the company submitted its US Gameboard wagering platform for approval by the regulator in the state. Consequently, Elys revealed earlier this week that it received approval from the regulator to operate a sportsbook located at the Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Growing in North America Is a Key Priority for USBookmaking</p>
<p>USBookmaking’s director of operations, John Salerno, commented on the topic by saying that the company is pleased to continue its collaboration with the Isleta resort. Moreover, he outlined that USBookmaking will continue to offer customers its high-quality sportsbook and service. In conclusion, Salerno said that the company’s expansion in North America continues and it will bring significant growth opportunities.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to continue our relationship with Isleta and to provide the highest quality sportsbook performance and service commitment to the casino and its customers.” John Salerno, director of operations at USBookmaking</p>
<p>As a global B2B gaming technology company, Elys operates in multiple countries around the world. The company has set up B2C online and land-based operations in Italy, but it has also expanded to the US market. By now, Elys operates in six different jurisdictions across the US.</p>
