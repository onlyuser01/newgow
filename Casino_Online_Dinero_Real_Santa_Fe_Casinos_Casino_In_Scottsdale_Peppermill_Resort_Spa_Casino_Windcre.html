    <h1>Casino Online Dinero Real Santa Fe Casinos Casino In Scottsdale Peppermill Resort Spa Casino Windcre</h1>

<p>I honesty have only dealt with the casino pretty recently. This is the first time I've ever noticed it and I assume it's only the first time it's happened. I was playing double ya luck when I first noticed it. I thought I was just imagining it because the things seemed to go from a few hundred to less than a hundred. I assumed I was imagining it because I lost so the past game I played after the fact was Fire Dragon. I lowered my bed when I noticed I was pretty much close to being done with. I was hitting very small amounts at this point on 20¢ bets but when I would spin the 20¢ came off without the 2-6 cents being added after the wins. That's when I knew I was not seeing things. I kept looking at the game play on my end and seeing a bunch of 0.00 losses wheni was winning, very small amounts but still winning something. That's what I kept asking for their records of the wins/loses and amounts won. I asked two different people and both gave me the same passive aggressive "I'm not going to technically say no but".... Type answers. I asked for a refund of the deposits I made this week because I knew I couldn't possibly know if this was the first day this happened, but I assumed it had to do with the larger withdrawal I made.</p>
<p>I actually didn't know I could contact the game provider but I'm going to look into that now. And I have no idea the amount of times this happened, as I only knew I was not seeing something that was not happening when I really started focusing when the funds were a lot easier to notice missing.</p>
