    <h1>Rising Sun Casino Rhythm City Casino Iowa Hotels Near Turning Stone Casino Ny Thief River Falls Casi</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>Hope that this finds you well,</p>
<p>I would like to start by apologizing for any inconvenience that Stefan had encountered whilst playing at Midas Casino. At Casino Midas, our intention is always to provide the best service and experience for all of our players.</p>
<p>After going through the whole journey that Stefan had with us, we have further investigated this case and see that some items were overlooked, starting from when Stefan had winnings and asked for the account to be restricted. Unfortunately, this was not an available option. The only possibility to restrict a player from playing winnings, betting, or depositing would be by closing the account entirely.</p>
<p>In this case, if we had closed the account, the account verification would have ceased. Therefore, he would not have been able to request a withdrawal. For a player to request or put a withdrawal into pending, the account must be fully verified. Verification takes 48hours to be processed which was also mentioned to the plater. If any player would not be aware of this time frame, it could lead to a bad experience which also led Stefan to state,</p>
<p>"I want to close my Account forever after the withdraw is finally processed. I need to Play at better and faster sites that allow withdraws Maybe you should Accept that withdraws are Part of the game"</p>
<p>We would also like to confirm that by no means did we try to delay the verification process for him.</p>
<p>Stefan was informed that the account was closed by email, but due to human error, it was not which left Stefan the opportunity to deposit a further €400, which we will be refunding in full. Upon Stefan stating that he had a gambling addiction, we proceeded with the account closure.</p>
<p>We have noted the issues that Stefan has encountered, and we will look to minimize these going forward. This one-off case will be used as a learning curve and we will also look at putting new measures in place to ensure that all players have a better and user-friendly experience at Casino Midas.</p>
<p>In order to rectify this issue and as mentioned above, we are issuing a reversal of his last deposit of €400. The player has been contacted by email on the reversal of his funds. It will be processed today and in his account within 3-5 working days.</p>
<p>Once again, kindly accept our apologies and we wish you all the best for the future.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Casino Midas</p>
