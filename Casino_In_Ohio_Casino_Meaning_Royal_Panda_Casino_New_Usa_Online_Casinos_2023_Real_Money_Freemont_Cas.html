<p>Fortuna Entertainment Group (FEG) has officially appointed Victor Corcoran as the new CEO. That includes Croatia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Corcoran will be replacing David Vaněk, who served as interim CEO after Per Widerström decided to leave and chase new career opportunities.</p>
<p>Corcoran Joins From Paddy Power Where He Worked as CEO</p>
<p>Before joining Fortune Entertainment Group, Corcoran was the CEO of Paddy Power. He worked there for 4 years. In June, Flutter, Paddy Power’s parent company, was implementing several changes and announced that Corcoran will vacate the CEO seat.</p>
<p>Corcoran’s departure from Paddy Power was actually a surprise as he was a key contributor to the operator’s return to prominence. One of his efforts included helping the company integrate with Betfair.</p>
<p>In a LinkedIn post, Corcoran shared a few words about his new appointment. He stated that he’s excited to join Fortuna Entertainment Group. He also praised the company by saying that it is one of the leading omnichannel gambling businesses in the CEE region.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Corcoran said that the company is packed with talent and continues to invest in technology. As a concluding note, Corcoran stated that Fortuna Entertainment Group works in regions that have massive potential and that is why his new journey will be exciting.</p>
<p>Corcoran’s appointment is the latest recent change in FEG’s executive team. Back in June, the company’s head of marketing, Petr Royce, announced that he will be leaving after 4 years of service.</p>
<p>FEG’s Vision Is to Become a Leading Omnichannel Betting and Gaming Brand in Europe</p>
<p>FEG’s journey started in the Czech Republic and thanks to its hard work and dedication, the company managed to expand across Central and Eastern Europe. These days, the company employs more than 6,000 people and became the biggest betting and gaming operator in CEE.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, won the Heptagon Award in the “Highest-Impact Campaign of the Year” category. That marked the second consecutive win in that category. Additionally, FEG was a runner-up in two additional categories – “Team Awards – Martech Ecosystem of the Year” and “Multichannel Campaign of the Year.”</p>
<p>Heptagon Awards represent an annual celebration where companies and individuals that achieved exceptional results in CRM marketing are celebrated.</p>
<p>As a leading international operator, FEG always strives to provide customers with the best experience possible. This experience includes gaming on smartphones, desktop devices, and in retail shops. In the words of the company, the past success of FEG will not limit its ambitions for the future.</p>
<p>That is why the company is striving to grow and become the top-rated omnichannel betting and gaming operator in Europe.</p>
