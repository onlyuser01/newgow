    <h1>Nyc Casinos Wild Horse Pass Casino Arizona Online Sweeps Casino Casino Websites Stratosphere Casino</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot agree with this decision.</p>
<p>1) I do not want to set a precedent for such cases. What do I mean by that? We are a very loyal casino, probably the most loyal of all. We always refund funds and give all sorts of compensation for any little things. We have had cases where a customer has created a second account and come to support when they realise this. There is no problem making a transfer from the old account to the new account or refunding the deposit. We do that in most cases, but not in this case.</p>
<p>2) If we refund the deposit, what prevents the client from registering a new account and claiming their deposit back again? If we returned the deposit once, by your logic, we would be obliged to return it a second time.</p>
<p>3) I understand that our judgment is not an argument for you, but I will clarify a few details: We always look at traits of customer behaviour, was his action intended to try to cheat the casino?</p>
<p>More often than not, there are no such flags. But not in this case.</p>
<p>The client deliberately made deposits knowing that he had a second account, he also provided emails showing that we had blocked him.</p>
<p>He opened a new account anyway and used the bonuses.</p>
<p>According to our logs - he tried to log in to the old account before registering the new one, checking if the account was really closed. Depositing only under the bonus is also an obvious indicator.</p>
<p>In the hope that the system can't find him - another deposit method was used.</p>
<p>Also, the client changed his residence address slightly, which does not match the first account</p>
<p>These are all flags by which we are guided. You may say that this is not direct evidence of a breach. Possibly. But this is a case where we follow the rules very strictly and will not deviate from them so as not to create a precedent for similar cases. The client must understand that an attempt to cheat the casino will result in a loss of funds.</p>
<p>If a person comes to the bank, looks at the cameras and writes something down in a notebook - you can be sure that he will be detained for suspicious activity. This is exactly the case here, we know very well how people act in an attempt to cheat casinos, we come across it every day. And there is absolutely every little thing here that indicates that this is the case.</p>
<p>The scenario is always the same if the customer has failed to cheat the casino - to try to get their money back at all costs, with any complaints and letters to the licence, but we are prepared for that.</p>
<p>Funds are confiscated according to casino rules, and no refunds are possible. Gambling addiction cannot be an excuse for trying to cheat a casino.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Andrei</p>
