    <h1>Casino Resort Casino Online Uk Chumba Casino Play Palace Casino Biloxi Ms Casinos Alabama Bitcoincas</h1>

<p>I discovered by the hard way that the most casinos like bitcoincsino.io they do accept the deposits instantly, but when the moment comes for withdraws ... then problems appears, let me explain further:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've made my 1st deposit of 50 euros, and then I upload my proof documents in my profile, after couple of hours they sent me an email and inform me that 2 documents are not accept it, because my utility bill are in Greek language and not in english??? and my credit card photo it's a scan ??? and not a photo (of course it was a photo).</p>
<p>I contact them via chat as the mail said and they told me to find a english language utility bill???. I've wrote them, that I prefer not to play in their casino at all and to reverse my deposit and then to close my account. They reply to me, that I need to play and wager at least 3 times the amount to make a withdraw. I told them how I can do that, if they don't accept my documents ... no reply.</p>
<p>I've went and play to the first slot machine, and lost the 50 euro.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this popular "issue" by many casino, it's totally fraud-less.</p>
<p>If they don't accept your documents you do not have the ability to made any withdraws.</p>
<p>At least, they have to add mock ups or samples to their documents area to help international players with this process.</p>
