<p>As a long-time member of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Flint was instrumental in the brand’s growth over the years</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment is set to part ways with one of its directors. According to the announcement, Richard Flint, ex-chief executive of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, will not seek re-election and will instead depart from the board.</p>
<p>Flint will finish his current term, which is set to run until May 1. On that date, Flutter will hold its annual general meeting when existing directors can apply for re-election to the board.</p>
<p>Flint joined Flutter back in March 2020 when the gambling giant acquired Sky Betting &amp; Gaming’s parent company, The Stars Group. Prior to that, he served as The Stars Group’s executive chairman, following the company’s acquisition of Star Betting &amp; Gaming.</p>
<p>The industry veteran’s term as Star Betting &amp; Gaming’s CEO came before this latest acquisition and saw him head the company for several years.</p>
<p>Flint has also served a variety of corporate entities as a board member and is currently sitting on the boards of LADbible Group and Seat Unique. He is also the chairperson of Butternut Box, a company that provides a fresh take on dog food.</p>
<p>The Board Wished Flint All the Best</p>
<p>As a long-time member of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, Flint was instrumental in the brand’s growth over the years. His experience and understanding of its business were also what secured him a seat among Flutter’s directors.</p>
<p>Speaking of Flutter’s board, the company chair, John Bryant, thanked Flint for his hard work and invaluable expertise. Bryant praised the outgoing director for everything he has done for the company and, on behalf of the board, wished him all the best.</p>
<p>The board wishes to thank Richard for the considerable value and strategic insights he has brought to Flutter during his tenure and acknowledge his tremendous contribution to the development of the Sky Bet business since its inception in 2001. We wish him success in the future. John Bryant, chair, Flutter</p>
<p>In December, Flutter’s shares spiked, sparking optimism about the company’s future. While the shares have since slumped, currently sitting at roughly $16.17 (converted to USD), the company remains bullish on maintaining its growth.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Flutter is preparing to cancel its secondary listing on the Dublin stock exchange on January 23 and start trading on the New York NASDAQ exchange instead.</p>
