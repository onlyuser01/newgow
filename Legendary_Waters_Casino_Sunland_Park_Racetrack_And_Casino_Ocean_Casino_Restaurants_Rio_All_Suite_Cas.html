    <h1>Legendary Waters Casino Sunland Park Racetrack And Casino Ocean Casino Restaurants Rio All Suite Cas</h1>

<p>The new event comes with €500,000 ($543,000) prize pool and it will be provided over the course of seven distinct competitions – or tournaments. Each tournament has its own name, theme, and setting, with the events to look forward to including Holiday Spirits, HalloWins, Wealth Seekers, Santa’s Gifts, New Year Luck, Winter Fortunes, and Festival of Love.</p>
<p>Spinomenal Brings Competitive Format Back for Another Year</p>
<p>In every event players partake, they will get to play multiple rounds for a chance to reach the final showdown called “Super Round,” where they get to multiply their scores, earn more points, and have the opportunity to rise in the pecking order and end the tournament at the helm of the pack.</p>
<p>While players work their way toward the Super Round, they will also have 10% of their scores set aside as credit to be used in the final round, giving them even more of an opportunity to win.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest iteration of the successful format, Spinomenal CCO Nir Ronen said that the tournaments have already proven to be a success with slot players and the developer was determined to continue providing such experiences. Ronen said:</p>
<p>The seven separate tournaments bring something for everyone and of course there is the substantial 500,000€ prize pool in reach for players. Good luck to one and all. Nir Ronen</p>
<p>The prize pool is divied up between the participants in progressing order, meaning that whoever places ahead will get a bigger chunk of the total. Spinomenal makes it easy for players to track their current scores, incentivizing competition and having fun with some of the best slot games available by the supplier and offered in a slightly more competitive form.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Spinomenal has been expanding its global footprint as a supplier. The company launched with Hollywoodbets in South Africa and Palms Bet in Bulgaria.</p>
