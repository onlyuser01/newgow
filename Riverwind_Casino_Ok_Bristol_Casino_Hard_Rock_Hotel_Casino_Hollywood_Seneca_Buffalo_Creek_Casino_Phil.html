<p>Sports betting and iGaming brand of MGM Resorts International and Entain BetMGM announced a new initiative under its partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings sports bars. By utilizing geolocation technology, BetMGM is offering customers physically present inside the bars access to exclusive promotions and bet types.</p>
<p>“Fans wagering on sports inside Buffalo Wild Wings can now win bigger on select bets thanks to our innovative partnership with BetMGM.” Rita Patel, Chief Marketing Officer, Buffalo Wild Wings</p>
<p>BWW Means Better BetMGM Odds</p>
<p>BetMGM and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW) launch the new industry initiative across six states in which sports betting is legal, Colorado, New Jersey, Indiana, Tennessee, West Virginia and Iowa under their partnership deal signed back in 2019.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings is incredibly innovative and allows BetMGM to redefine how fans enjoy sports.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>As part of the exclusive customer experience initiative, BWW launched the OT Odds Powered by BetMGM in-bar channel, which will deliver live betting odds, fantasy, and betting advice, as well as other sports betting-related content across all participating venues in the country.</p>
<p>“The introduction of geolocation technology to offer bettors a customized experience in a Buffalo Wild Wings location is a great example of what we’re able to activate through this groundbreaking relationship.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Further personalization of the channel, including curated boosts, bets and parlays under the Blazin’ Bets tab within the BetMGM app, accessible via mobile phones and other devices, will be available in states where wagering on sport events is legal.</p>
<p>“As sports betting continues to grow throughout the country, we look forward to further expanding our footprint in the space and activating our partnership with BetMGM in ways that make the experience at our sports bars second to none.” Rita Patel, Chief Marketing Officer, Buffalo Wild Wings</p>
<p>New Design Upgrades for BWW’s Picks and Props</p>
<p>The free-to-play game Picks and Props available via the mobile app of the nationwide-present sports bar chain received new upgrades under the new initiative, featuring parlay-style gameplay with elements from the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>The game powered by BetMGM odds is available on a daily basis in states where free-to-play games are legally permitted, while winners receive their prizes every month, with a select few of them having the chance to feature in the new BWW Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>BetMGM is not the only sports betting partner for the casual dining restaurant and sports bar chain with a presence in multiple locations worldwide such as Mexico, Canada, India, Oman, Panama, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, besides the US.</p>
<p>In December 2020, BWW in Mexico teamed with Malta-based online betting and gaming company Betcris, in a deal similar to the one with BetMGM, to bring sports betting to the restaurant venues in the country.</p>
