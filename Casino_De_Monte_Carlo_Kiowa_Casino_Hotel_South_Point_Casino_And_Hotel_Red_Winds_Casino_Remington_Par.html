    <h1>Casino De Monte Carlo Kiowa Casino Hotel South Point Casino And Hotel Red Winds Casino Remington Par</h1>

<p>1) I have deposited 1000$ and got a 500$ bonus.</p>
<p>2) I wagered the 40x that was required and was supposed to withdraw 3800$.</p>
<p>3) as I have bet over the max amount per bet at some occasion they declined the withdrawal.</p>
<p>4) I am asking that they reimburse at least the deposit (1000$).</p>
<p>5) if I would have lost they would have had no problem with it but as I won they are being abusive with applying unfair terms and conditions that are really hard to understand (and the casino had let me bet soâ€¦..).</p>
<p>6) they say they are withholding the winnings for those reasons but they are in fact withholding MY DEPOSITS.</p>
