<p>Monday Night Football Sees Bettors Back Underdog Seahawks Over 49ers</p>

<p>Monday Night Football heads back to the Bay Area this week, as the San Francisco 49ers host the Seattle Seahawks in an NFC West clash.</p>

<p>The 8-0 Niners, the last undefeated team in the NFL, would still lead the division if the 7-2 Seahawks win Monday. Oddsmakers have made San Francisco the favorite. According to sports analytics site numberFire, the Niners are six-point favorites at most sportsbooks, although FanDuel currently has the Niners at 5.5 points and BetMGM is offering 6.5 points.</p>
<p>While numberFire gives SF a 70.3 percent chance of winning, bettors at FanDuel and William Hill are heavily invested in the Seahawks.</p>
<p>At William Hill, 63 percent of the point spread bets and 67 percent of the money on the spread have been bet on the Seahawks.</p>
<p>Bettors also see tremendous value on the Seahawks money line. William Hill says 89 percent of the bets it has taken, which accounts for 77 percent of the cash put on moneyline bets, have been placed on the Seahawks, who are +210.</p>
<p>San Francisco, meanwhile, is -250 on the moneyline.</p>
<p>Percentages are similar at FanDuel, where 78 percent of the spread bets and 76 percent of the cash has been laid on the Seahawks.</p>
<p>FanDuel bettors are also jumping at the chance to potentially double their money, as 90 percent of the moneyline bets are on the Seahawks. FanDuel’s currently offering the same +210 odds, and 86 percent of the cash has been wagered on Seattle.</p>
<p>Bettors also expect a high-scoring game. The over/under is currently at 47 at William Hill and 46.5 at FanDuel. Over bets represent 80 percent of the tickets and 79 percent of the cash at William Hill, while at FanDuel, 77 percent of the bets and 78 percent of the money have been placed on the over.</p>
<p>Seahawks Toughest Test So Far for 49ers</p>
<p>One of the reasons bettors may be behind the Seahawks is the fact that Seattle has played a tougher schedule so far. While the Seahawks have lost to both the 7-2 New Orleans Saints and the 7-2 Baltimore Ravens, those are two teams the 49ers have yet to face.</p>
<p>The Seahawks represent the toughest test San Francisco has faced all season. The Niners are a team whose three best wins have come against teams with 5-4 records. They will face the Saints and Ravens on back-to-back weeks next month.</p>
<p>Still, San Francisco is a formidable foe, especially at Levi’s Stadium. The 49ers have won all three home games this season, including a 31-3 dispatching of Cleveland in a Monday night football game on Oct. 7.</p>
<p>In their last home game, a 51-13 win over Carolina on Oct. 27, Jimmy Garoppolo completed 18 of 22 passes for 175 yards and two scores, and Tevin Coleman scored three times on 11 carries for 105 yards.</p>
<p>Will Gordon Play?</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Seattle made headlines when it claimed wide receiver Josh Gordon off waivers from New England. The Patriots opted to cut ties to the talented but controversial player.</p>
<p>Since his breakout 2013 season, when he caught 87 passes for 1,646 yards and nine scores, Gordon has missed two full seasons and played sparingly as he’s tried to overcome substance abuse issue.</p>
<p>In 11 games last year with the Patriots, he caught 40 passes for 720 yards and three scores. In six games this year with New England, he had 20 catches for 287 yards and a score before going on injured reserve.</p>
<p>Seahawks coach Pete Carroll told reporters on Friday he wasn’t committing to Gordon, but added there’s “a good chance” he would get on the field for the Monday Night Football game.</p>
<p>He was very impressive in terms of picking stuff up, studying overtime,” Carroll told the Associated Press. “He fit in really well. He’s a really good athlete. You can really tell that he’s got a lot of potential to be a big-time player. It was fun seeing him on the practice field. Did a nice job.”</p>
<p>The Seahawks depth chart currently shows him as a third-string receiver.</p>
<p>Kickoff is set for 8:15 pm ET, with ESPN broadcasting the game.</p>
