<p>Leading aggregator Groove has agreed on a new deal with Fazi, a producer of electronic roulettes, gaming software and iGaming titles. The deal will see the developer onboard its acclaimed online gambling games to Groove’s aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Fazi Powers Groove’s Platform with Content</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Fazi will power Groove’s portfolio with its suite of engaging iGaming titles. As a result, Groove will receive access to more than 100 HTML5 games produced by the developer.</p>
<p>Fazi, which was founded in 1991, is a developer with over three decades of experience in the gaming sector. Throughout its existence, the company has worked on many games, with some of its more recent hits being Book of Spells, Burning Ice Deluxe, Crystal Hot 40 and Wild Hot 40. In addition, the developer has worked on some great virtual roulette and video poker games and, overall, has a greatly varied and rich portfolio.</p>
<p>Groove, on the other hand, is a fairly new aggregation specialist that has quickly grown to be a leading force in iGaming. The company was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur Yahale Meltzer and former Microsoft alumni Gil Strauss and sports an experienced team of industry veterans. In just six years, Groove compiled a jaw-dropping portfolio of hundreds of games from over 70 gaming operators. Thanks to that, the aggregator now has clients on five continents.</p>
<p>Groove Is Happy to Have Fazi on Board</p>
<p>2022 marks Groove’s sixth anniversary. The company is currently focused on reinforcing its ties with investors while continuing to enrich the aggregation platform’s range of games with content from innovative providers such as Fazi.</p>
<p>Yahale Meltzer, the chief operating officer of Groove, described the platform as a “well-balanced and innovative product” that provides a wide range of clients with iGaming products. He was happy to announce that this content has been further enhanced with the addition of Fazi-developed titles.</p>
<p>Meltzer lauded Fazi as an industry professional and said he will be glad to deliver the company’s premium content to Groove’s partnering Tier-1 operators, among other brands.</p>
<p>Bonjan Mitic, Fazi’s chief executive officer, was delighted to see that Fazi continues to be one of the best-loved brands in iGaming. He said that he is glad to see his company’s content onboarded to Groove and is looking forward to working with the aggregator.</p>
<p>Groove have always been high on our list of aggregators to partner with and we know we are joining some of the best-known names in the industry. Bonjan Mitic, CEO, Fazi</p>
<p>This June, Groove also inked a distribution agreement with Spinomenal.</p>
