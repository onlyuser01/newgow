<p>Online gambling software provider Playtech has teamed up with Quickspin Live to release a new live casino game. The latest addition to Playtech’s impressive portfolio is called Big Bad Wolf Live and is an innovative game with multiple engaging mechanics.</p>
<p>Despite being Quickspin Live’s inaugural live casino product, the game reflects the company’s knack for innovation. Quickspin seeks to pair best-in-class tech with robust entertainment capabilities to capture a new generation of gamblers. To that end, Quickspin leveraged Playtech’s outstanding technology tools to create a game that can redefine the live casino space.</p>
<p>Playtech and Quickspin’s meticulous attention to detail is highlighted by the new game. Big Bad Wolf Live features pristine art and many exciting gameplay features that will keep players on the edge of their seats. The release emphasizes the two companies’s desire to go beyond the boundaries of what live casino gaming can be.</p>
<p>The strategic collaboration between Playtech and Quickspin seeks to shape the future of the sector, according to the official announcement.</p>
<p>The New Game Was Described as “Truly Immersive”</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new release with Quickspin’s chief executive officer, Panagiotis Chryssovitsanos, saying that the game is in line with his company’s vision to deliver “thrilling gaming experiences” with the company’s “own blend of high-quality production value, creativity and love.”</p>
<p>Chryssovitsanos pointed out that his team seeks to cater to younger online casino players – a generation that grew up with video games and arcades. He hopes that his company’s content will appeal to these players, allowing Quickspin Live to engage and form the next generation of players.</p>
<p>He concluded that his team is happy to have Playtech as its partner:</p>
<p>We are also fortunate enough to have Playtech as our partner, providing us with market-leading technology and expertise, enabling us to turn our dreams into reality. Panagiotis Chryssovitsanos, CEO, Quickspin Live</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Edo Haitin, Playtech Live’s own chief executive officer, said that the launch of Big Bad Wolf Live marks Quickspin Live’s foray into the live casino sector. He reiterated his company’s intentions to work with Quickspin Live to “redefine the boundaries of live casino gaming and set new industry standards.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the release itself, Haitin said that the title showcases the capabilities of the Playtech Live platform and Quickspin’s creative approach to gaming.</p>
<p>The game is truly an immersive RNG &amp; Live experience, setting the bar higher for the industry; the outstanding attention to detail in the studio and entertaining gameplay combined with first-of-its-kind features and Quickspin’s signature high quality. Edo Haitin, CEO, Playtech Live</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Playtech agreed to supply France’s FDJ with its poker network and services.</p>
