    <h1>Casino Deposit Bonuses Casino Immokalee Thunder Valley Casino Resort 1200 Athens Ave Lincoln Ca 9564</h1>

<p>eCOGRA has continued to grow in the United States, as the company, which specializes in testing, inspection and certification of online gambling software and systems, and is seen as the standard bearer in the industry, now confirming its expansion with offices in Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p>The company is dedicated to ensuring that global gambling standards are maintained through the delivery of impartial evaluation of the algorithms that determine the payout of individual games of chance.</p>
<p>eCOGRA is also storied as it is the first non-US testing lab to gain traction in the North American market, and the United States specifically, and have its assessment used as a benchmark to measure against. The company has built a reputation for reliability and excellence, and it is determined to continue growing in multiple states across the country, with operations in six already.</p>
<p>The opening of a new office only seeks to reinforce its presence and standing with operators and businesses that are seeking to ensure that their software is compliant, and that they meet cybersecurity and Random Number Generator standards as well.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the company also picked Daniel Remmes as Director of Compliance for the United States, and who will be working on building eCOGRA’s position in the challenging market.</p>
<p>"I’m thrilled to begin this new role with eCOGRA and to seize the opportunity to work with our talented team. eCOGRA is recognized as a leading internationally accredited testing agency, with specialization in the certification of online gambling software and systems; specific to the company’s expansion of business in the U.S market," Remmes said in a statement.</p>
<p>eCOGRA has similarly sought to expand in other states in the country and successfully obtained a certification in Connecticut last year. The company is coming to the market at a time of rapid expansion for both iGaming and sports betting.</p>
<p>Companies such as eCOGRA also play a pivotal role in helping iGaming gain traction, as reluctant lawmakers may fear that online gambling is unsafe or fails to uphold rigorous standards such as those maintained in land-based gambling.</p>
<p>There have already been many successful examples of iGaming industry launches in the United States, however, including in places such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey, proving that private businesses and independent testing bodies have the means necessary to maintain a level playfield for all.</p>
