<p>“BetMGM has embraced the Golf Event Centre platform that we have worked so closely with our key federation partners to create.” Max Wright, SVP Commercial, IMG ARENA</p>
<p>In-Play Golf Betting Solution</p>
<p>The front-end solution Golf Event Centre created in collaboration with the world’s leading golf tours is seeking to transform the experience for bettors in golf by allowing them in-play wagering on the sport, giving them access to fast and comprehensive data and markets, live streaming and interactive course visualizations, and is available to sportsbook operators across worldwide jurisdictions where wagering is legal.</p>
<p>“The Golf Event Centre is an incredible product that allows operators the ability to genuinely differentiate their sportsbook offering on one of the world’s most popular sports.” Max Wright, SVP Commercial, IMG ARENA</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, BetMGM will also utilize the golf streaming feed of the sports betting service and content hub which allows sports fans to keep in touch with the action on 2 par-3 holes from the PGA TOUR weekly.</p>
<p>“The Golf Event Centre allows us to introduce a totally new and captivating concept to BetMGM customers. It’s a product that is both useful and exciting, putting a wealth of information at players’ fingertips, with an intuitive and interactive delivery that augments golf viewing and betting.” Ryan Spoon, Chief Operating Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>BetMGM will capture these holes by 3 cameras tee-to-green and will feature in the feed dedicated shot and hole score bets for each group that arrives on tee.</p>
<p>PGA TOUR Presence</p>
<p>The agreement with IMG ARENA extended on BetMGM’s presence in golf after the sports betting brand was named official betting operator of the PGA TOUR in the summer of 2020, Scott Warfield, vice president of gaming at the PGA TOUR noted, pointing to the dynamic addition the Golf Event Centre acquisition presented in terms of growth and brand awareness.</p>
<p>“The Golf Event Centre is a first-class product that will transcend sports betting on golf.” Scott Warfield, VP, Gaming, PGA TOUR</p>
<p>The PGA TOUR, via its ShotLink system comprising of walking scorers, lasers, and greenside cameras, collects and distributes in real-time a wide range of data points related to each shot in the competition. It named IMG ARENA as its official data distributor for media and wagering purposes in 2018.</p>
