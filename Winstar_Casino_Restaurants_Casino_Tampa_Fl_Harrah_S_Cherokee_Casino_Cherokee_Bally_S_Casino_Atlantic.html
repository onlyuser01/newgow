<p>Star Entertainment to Face Public Grilling on Anti-Money Laundering Failures</p>

<p>Australia’s Star Entertainment will face a public inquiry in the state of New South Wales (NSW) into allegations it permitted its Sydney property to be infiltrated by organized crime.</p>

<p>The company’s shares plunged by almost 23 percent a week ago. That’s following damning reports in Australian media that claimed it had “enabled money laundering.”</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald reports that senior barrister Adam Bell, SC, will lead the review. That’s bad news for Star. Bell’s in-depth grilling of Crown Resorts’ operations last year under similar circumstances ultimately led to the revocation of the operator’s NSW gaming license.</p>
<p>Suppressed Report Denial</p>
<p>Bell is expected to cross-examine Star Entertainment executives, including CEO Matt Bekier, to find out how much they knew about the company’s alleged anti-money laundering (AML) failings.</p>
<p>The existence of a 2018 internal report compiled by auditor KPMG that heavily criticized Star’s AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protocols may create some difficult questions for Star’s board members.</p>
<p>Last week’s media stories claim the report was ignored and buried. In an official statement last Tuesday, Star called this “incorrect,” and said the report’s findings have been actioned.</p>
<p>$77M Slots Session</p>
<p>Media allegations against the company include that it allowed Chinese high rollers to access hundreds of millions of dollars using a system that raised serious AML concerns. The VIP guests were permitted to withdraw funds for gambling that were disguised as hotel expenses.</p>
<p>Star is accused of putting profits before compliance by failing to properly vet hundreds of high rollers, some of whom were high-level criminals.</p>
<p>These include Mende Rajkoski, who until recently was the biggest slots player at the Star Sydney. He once gambled $US77 million on the machines in one week, despite having a minimal income.</p>
<p>In June, Rajkoski was arrested for attempting to import three tons of cocaine with a street value of US$700 million into Australia.</p>
<p>Rogues’ Gallery</p>
<p>Other former regulars include Tom Zhou, aka “Mr Chinatown,” a Chinese crime boss wanted by Interpol, and suspected sex trafficker and money launderer Simon Pan. Also on the list is Huang Xiangmo, who was labeled a “foreign influence agent” by the Australian government and expelled from the country as a national security risk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Herald alleges that Star’s senior vice president of VIP gaming, Mark Walker, “maintained a secret and longstanding relationship” with alleged corporate fraudster Michael Gu.</p>
<p>Gu is a fugitive from justice after disappearing with US$245 million of his investors’ money.</p>
<p>Star is now facing possible class-action lawsuits from investors after around US$740 million was wiped off its market value when it’s shares crashed last week.</p>
<p>It is also being probed by Australia’s financial crimes unit, AUSTRAC, and is expected to face severe financial penalties once that investigation is completed.</p>
