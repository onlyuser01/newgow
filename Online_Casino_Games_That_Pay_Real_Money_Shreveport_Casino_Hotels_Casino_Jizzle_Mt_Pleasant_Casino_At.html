<p>BetMGM has been announced as the new title sponsor of the Premier League Darts in 2024 thanks to the freshly-inked agreement with the Professional Darts Corporation</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ exclusive online and offline sports betting partner, BetMGM, and Premier League Darts, the popular darts tournament launched in 2005 on Sky Sports, have sealed an important agreement with effects throughout 2024.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been announced as the new title sponsor of the sport’s most popular roadshow event, the BetMGM Premier League, which will take place between February and May.</p>
<p>Eight Players Competing for £1M</p>
<p>During the 17 league nights dedicated to the big event, 8 skilled darts players will try their best to progress to the Play-Offs at the end of the season. The Play-Offs will host the top four players sat at the prestigious final league table.</p>
<p>During each of the 16 league nights scheduled for the 2024 event, players will attend mini-events sponsored by BetMGM thanks to the partnership made possible via the Professional Darts Corporation.</p>
<p>According to the Professional Darts Corporation’s chief executive, Matt Porter, the Premier League is expected to record massive numbers in terms of live audiences, as well as an equally impressive global television audience during the four months of competition.</p>
<p>Porter also took the chance to express their delight in being able to welcome the provider of sports betting, live casino and casino games, MGM Exclusives, and MGM Millions as their brand-new title sponsor.</p>
<p>The special context marked by the “20th staging of the Premier League” makes the new sponsorship agreement even more important for BetMGM, as further explained by the same chief executive.</p>
<p>BetMGM Looking Forward to “an Action-Packed 2024”</p>
<p>BetMGM, which has also inked similarly important sponsorship agreements with big soccer clubs including Newcastle United, Manchester City, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, alongside talkSPORT, has used the voice of UK director Sam Behar to express their thrill regarding the new partnership.</p>
<p>Describing the Premier League Darts as “an exciting and entertaining event,” Behar also stated the company was looking forward to experiencing an action-filled year for both the Professional Darts Corporation and their brand.</p>
<p>The BetMGM Premier League will kick start on February 1 in Cardiff, and it will carry on in 15 other locations. The list includes Berlin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Exeter, Brighton, Nottingham, Dublin, Belfast, Manchester, Birmingham, Rotterdam, Liverpool, Aberdeen, Leeds, and Sheffield.</p>
<p>The Play-Offs will be held in London. Later today, the BetMGM Premier League Darts tournament will announce the lineup for 2024.</p>
<p>BetMGM ended last year by revealing its ambitious growth plans for 2024, which will target a boost in its market presence, and inking a new agreement with Realistic Games.</p>
