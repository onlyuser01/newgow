    <h1>Players Club Casino Boulder Casino Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs Hotel The Commerce Casino Hotel C</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>I’ve played at the 07th of July this week at Will’s Casino and won 2000€ after wagering the bonus. Without thinking of anything bad, I’ve tried to withdraw 2x 1000€ (Because the casino has a withdraw limit of 1500€).</p>
<p>On the next day I’ve checked the withdraw status on Will’s Casino and without any contact or information by their support team I found out that the withdraw was canceled on July 8th, 2020.</p>
<p>It was only when I contacted the customer support that I found out that the line bet for the game "John Hunter and the Book Of Tut" was too high.</p>
<p>I have read the bonus conditions beforehand and in the main section there is a maximum bet of 4€ listed. Only in the lower section with the headline "A list of what may be deemed abuse may include but is not limited to" (Comeon, who is writing a bonus condition headline like that?) is a line bet of max. 0.30 cents listed.</p>
<p>In the game "John Hunter and the Book Of Tut" there is no possibility to place a line bet. You can only set "Coins per line" and "Coin Value" and non of these exceeded the 0,30 Cents value.</p>
<p>So I’ve played the 4€ max bet which was regulated in the terms of Will's Casino and never exceeded it.</p>
<p>Confiscating all of the winnings due to misleading bonus terms shows once again that online casinos are looking for all sorts of loopholes so that they do not have to pay out the money to players.</p>
<p>Listing a 0.30 cent line bet (which almost no other online casino usually does) is obviously there to take advantage of such situations.</p>
<p>Please help me in this matter, since I have followed the rules and once again a casino is using vague conditions to harm players.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Mat</p>
