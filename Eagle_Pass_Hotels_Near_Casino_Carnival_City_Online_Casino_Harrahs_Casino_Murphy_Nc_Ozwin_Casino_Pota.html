<p>The interactive gaming arm of Boyd Gaming Corporation, Boyd Interactive Gaming, announced a new partnership with Playtech, the leading supplier of content and solutions, powering the global online gambling industry. Details regarding the new content agreement emerged Wednesday and saw the iGaming content supplier agree to deliver games for Boyd Interactive’s Stardust-branded online casinos. Thanks to the new collaboration, customers of the operator in New Jersey, as well as Pennsylvania will be able to access thrilling and quality games from Playtech.</p>
<p>The new partnership underlines the iGaming supplier's commitment to deliver exceptional experiences to more customers across the United States. At the same time, the strategic agreement grows Playtech's global footprint, allowing its engaging titles to reach new customers. The new deal is expected to help Boyd Interactive grow as well by offering industry-leading content for customers of its Stardust online casinos in the aforementioned states.</p>
<p>Ultimately, clients of the operator in New Jersey and Pennsylvania will benefit from unique online casino games, promising thrilling experiences and engaging features. This will help further solidify Stardust's position within the iGaming vertical in the two states, boosting its market share and growing its customer base.</p>
<p>Marcus Yoder, Playtech USA's Chief Commercial Officer, commented on the topic in a statement. "By introducing the exciting Stardust online casinos, Boyd Gaming expanded its long-standing tradition of surpassing expectations and delivering unique entertainment experiences into the online space," he explained. Finally, Yoder noted: "The team at Playtech is thrilled to collaborate with the Boyd team and we are confident that the joining of our forces will bring mutual success to both companies."</p>
<p>Jim Ryan, Boyd Interactive's Chief Executive Officer, added: "We are excited to incorporate Playtech’s exceptional online casino and Live Casino games into our Stardust offerings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey." He explained that the company is looking forward to seeing Stardust players gain access to quality Playtech titles such as Gold Rush: Cash Collect, Age of the Gods and others.</p>
<p>The deal with Playtech comes on the heels of changes to Boyd Gaming's executive team. The company recently confirmed four senior-level promotions in an effort to strengthen its management team and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Besides propelling the reach of Playtech's games, the deal complements the growth of Boyd Gaming. The collaboration comes at a time when the company anticipates further growth and expansion. Last year, Boyd Gaming acquired Boyd Interactive, which was formerly known as Pala Interactive. Continuing its expansion, the company launched Stardust online casinos in New Jersey and Pennsylvania this spring.</p>
