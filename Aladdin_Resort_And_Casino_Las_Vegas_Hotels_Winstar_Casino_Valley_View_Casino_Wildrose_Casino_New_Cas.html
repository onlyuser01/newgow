<p>ESPN and Caesars Entertainment announced on Tuesday the creation of a partnership that will expand the sports broadcasting company’s presence in Las Vegas in a big way.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s The LINQ will be the site of a new studio for ESPN, which will serve as a broadcasting hub for the network in Las Vegas. The studio, part of a new partnership forged with Caesars and ESPN, will be based in the hotel’s Vortex Balcony and overlook both Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Strip. (Image: Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Caesars has agreed to build a studio for ESPN at its LINQ Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Network officials said the studio will be used to produce sports betting-themed content for ESPN’s networks, Web site, streaming service, and mobile application. In addition, Caesars will serve as ESPN’s official odds supplier, receiving attribution for the lines across all ESPN outlets.</p>
<p>The news came on the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s ruling that overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and opened the door for sports betting to be legalized across the country.</p>
<p>The sports betting landscape has changed, and fans are coming to us for this kind of information more than ever before,” said Mike Morrison, ESPN’s vice president of business development, in a release.</p>
<p>It also comes less than a week after FOX Sports and The Stars Group announced a partnership that will involve the development of two mobile applications, one a betting app and the other a free-to-play gaming app featuring prizes.</p>
<p>Officials with ESPN and Caesars said more details about the partnership will be revealed in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Vegas a Big Sports Town</p>
<p>Until last May, Nevada held a near monopoly on sports betting in the country, but for most of that time, the only other sporting activities within Las Vegas that drew national attention were the occasional boxing title match and University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball, when the Runnin’ Rebels were competing for an NCAA title.</p>
<p>That’s changed in recent years. Ultimate Fighting and other mixed martial arts fight cards are held there regularly. The Vegas Golden Knights now are in their second year as an NHL franchise, and the city also hosts NBA Summer League action. In addition, the Oakland Raiders will move to the city in 2020, and to celebrate their arrival, the NFL will host its player draft in Sin City next year.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas has become an epicenter of sports culture,” said ESPN’s Executive Vice President of Content Connor Schell.</p>
<p>The studio, which will be built along the Las Vegas Strip, will be used prominently during major sporting events held in Vegas and elsewhere. It will also be used to create segments for ESPN’s Daily Wager, a weekday show on sports betting-related topics hosted by Doug Kezirian, and other gambling-related shows and podcasts.</p>
<p>Studio to Open Next Year</p>
<p>Adrienne Prather-Marcos, Caesars director of corporate communications, told Casino.org the studio will be located on the LINQ’s second floor at its Hotel Vortex balcony, where it will overlook both Caesars Palace and the Strip.</p>
<p>According to the joint press release, it will open in 2020.</p>
<p>Next year is setting up to be a big year for LINQ. Recently, it was announced that Kind Heaven, an Asian-themed venue estimated to cost $100 million will also open next year.</p>
<p>Developed by Immersive Artistry, the 100,000-square-foot attraction, which combines dining, shopping, and gambling, is set to include holograms of famous musicians for entertainment. Patrons can gamble using wearable technology and wager on such games as wrestling matches between holographic animals. Perry Farrell, lead singer for Jane’s Addiction and Porno for Pyros as well as the founder of music festival Lollapalooza, will oversee Kind Heaven’s musical content.</p>
<p>It was set to open this year, but construction delays have caused officials to move the open date back.</p>
