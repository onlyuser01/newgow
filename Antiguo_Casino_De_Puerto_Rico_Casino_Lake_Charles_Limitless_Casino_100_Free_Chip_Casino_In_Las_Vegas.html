    <h1>Antiguo Casino De Puerto Rico Casino Lake Charles Limitless Casino 100 Free Chip Casino In Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Dear Flo999,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I would like to warn you, that if your deposit has never been credited to your casino account, the only thing you can do is to contact your payment provider. They need to investigate, but bear in mind, that it’s a lengthy process that takes approximately one month. In these cases, the casino has its hands tied. Meanwhile, I would strongly recommend not to deposit any more funds until the issue is sorted.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if the e-wallet address to deposit funds into your account was visible on the casino’s website for all the players or if you were provided a unique one when opening the account?</p>
<p>Was it your first deposit in this casino?</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Coinplay Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@coinplay.com (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. If there is any option for an alternative contact such as live chat or WhatsApp, please try that too and save screenshots of the relevant communication.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
