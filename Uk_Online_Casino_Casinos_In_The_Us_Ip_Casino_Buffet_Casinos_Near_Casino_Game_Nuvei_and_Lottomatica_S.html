    <h1>Uk Online Casino Casinos In The Us Ip Casino Buffet Casinos Near Casino Game Nuvei and Lottomatica S</h1>

<p>Leading group and operator in the gaming market authorized by the Customs and Monopoly Agency in Italy, Lottomatica has joined hands with the innovative payment platform Nuvei. The two have agreed on an exclusive partnership that would turn Nuvei into Lottomatica’s unique payment partner. In return, the former would use its expertise in iGaming payments to speed up revenue acceleration for Lottomatica while further proving its leadership position in Europe.</p>
<p>Nuvei to Use Integrated Cashier Technology and Smart Transaction Routing</p>
<p>Nasdaq-listed Nuvei will help the Italian operator that specializes in online games, sports betting, and amusement and entertainment machines completely freshen up its digital services. The re-platforming process will be completed with the incorporation of market-leading solutions for making deposits and cashing out funds via Nuvei’s integrated cashier technology.</p>
<p>The payment platform’s smart transaction routing will also be put to use. It will help maintain the costs to a minimum while considerably improving Lottomatica’s costs. At the same time, smart transaction routing is also expected to considerably grow card payment acceptance rates. Besides the card payment alternative, players opting for Lottomatica games will also be able to complete their transactions with the help of the most popular and relevant alternative options for payment with the help of Nuvei’s single integration solutions.</p>
<p>Payments, Fundamental to Deliver Superior iGaming Products</p>
<p>According to Lottomatica’s managing director betting and digital Italy Alessandro Fiumara, payments are “fundamental” for delivering superior products in the iGaming industry. He added that this is the reason why they are so helpful at attracting new players and retaining existing ones while maximizing revenue. Fiumara added that their new partnership with Nuvei is expected to offer their players the exact payment experience that they want and need.</p>
<p>His statement was completed by Nuvei’s chief executive officer and chair Philip Fayer who called Lottomatica “one of the premier iGaming brands” part of the regulated gaming market in Italy. Fayer also expressed his company was pleased to be able to provide a full payment solution that would help promote the growth of a new leading iGaming operator in Europe. Fayer considered the new partnership would give them the chance to keep proving why they are the leading payments provider for the online gaming sector in Europe as well as at an international level. Things like their full dedication to top-notch customer support, their entirely customizable technology, and advanced knowledge of global regulated markets are what help them stick their head above their competitors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, Lottomatica signed a partnership deal with Play’n GO, enabling it to further strengthen its foothold in Italy.</p>
