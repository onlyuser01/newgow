<p>DAZNBET is bracing for the road ahead in the United Kingdom and the sports betting arm of the namesake media and entertainment company is now looking for a Head of Safer Gambling in the country. This comes shortly after DAZNBET launched as a licensed operator in the country and reflects the companyâ€™s commitment to delivering on its Social Responsibility regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This is why the company is now on the prowl for a qualified individual who can help DAZNBET steer through one of the most challenging markets that expects operators to deliver on the highest possible standards of consumer protection. The person stepping into this new position will report directly to the Director of Customer Operations and they will be charged with ensuring that the "automated tools and processes are robust and seamless to the customer," the LinkedIn job post specified.</p>
<p>Among the key responsibilities listed (a lengthy read), the company says that it expects from its future Head of Safer Gambling to make certain that player safety procedures are upheld and that customer safety is a driving principle. The new manager will also have to deal with various issues pertaining to KYC, AML, fraud &amp; payments matters and liaise with the corresponding teams on each issue.</p>
<p>The Head of Safer Gambling will also be tasked with further streamlining and optimizing processes within the company, allowing it to stay on par with regulatory standards in the country. There will be daily, weekly, and monthly reporting to ensure that the technology deployed is delivering the desired results. Furthermore, DAZNBET expects the new hire to continue to collaborate with teams from across the entire organization to ensure that regulatory standards are met in full.</p>
<p>The qualified individual will have to have experience in running safer gambling teams in another Tier 1 operator, the job post details. Other qualifications from the individual include understanding of AML, data security compliance, regulation, gambling licensing and more. The individual would have to be self-organized and capable of delivering policy derivatives in a robust and consistent way that align with company expectations and regulatory prerequisites.</p>
<p>Overall, DAZNBET will expect a lot from its Head of Safer Gambling, as the company wants to make sure that it stands head and shoulder with all other operators in the market.</p>
