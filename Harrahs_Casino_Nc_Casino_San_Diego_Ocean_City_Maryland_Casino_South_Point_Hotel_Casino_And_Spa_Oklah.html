<p>Hello dear guru team ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I played at Playtoro Casino on 2/16/23 I played Sahara Riches Cash Collect at 40 cents then the bar with the free spins (between 15 and 20 numbers) and the collect what you need to get these free spins suddenly came out of nowhere on the server Time out I started the game again...no free spins not the picture what I got before the server time out...nothing I also wrote there and only with the BOT MARCUS...then searched out the support email addresses online there emails written with the problem ONE answer came in the casino chat:</p>
<p>Hello Manuela, Thank you for contacting us about games. My name is Lina and I will help you! I am sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear that you were not able to play the free spins in game.</p>
<p>So that we can investigate this, could you please send us the game and session ID since when did this happen?</p>
<p>Click 3 Bars &gt; Cashier &gt; Game History &gt; Game Activity. On the Game Activity page, select "Game Type" &gt; Find the name of the "Games" played &gt; Enter the date the game was played "From". Click Submit.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you. Have a nice day Manuela.</p>
<p>Said and done I then emailed: Hello game Sahara Riches Cash Collect 02/16/23 session ID: 317720834 was from 8.18 think after about 5 spins it came but I don't know exactly I had something over 31 euros on it and the server came pretty quickly Time out NO reply since then. I think it's unfair that there is no longer a response and I certainly won't cause any trouble if it weren't the case.</p>
<p>A customer support was only to write via email otherwise you will be fobbed off in the casino chat with the bot Marcus</p>
<p>Normally a casino should see if and when a game fails or not? I deposited â‚¬30 with no bonus</p>
<p>I hope you can help me, I think it's cheeky that they took my chance to win something. Unfortunately, everything happened so quickly that a picture wasn't possible, so I don't have any proof</p>
