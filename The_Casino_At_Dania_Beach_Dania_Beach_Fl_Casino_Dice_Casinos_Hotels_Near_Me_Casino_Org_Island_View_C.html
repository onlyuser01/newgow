<p>Rosh Immortality Cube review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Rosh Immortality Cube is set in an original fantasy realm. On one side, the forces of evil preside over a brutally ravaged land, on the other, the forces of light protect what is left of nature. In between is the sorcery Rosh who draws his power from a mysterious artefact known as the Cube.</p>
<p>The Cube appears on the reels from time to time to trigger features, making the story an integral part of the mechanics of the game.</p>
<p>From the few details and character art on the reel, players can get an excellent sense of a rich world full of magical beings and powerful races.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics for Rosh Immortality Cube are awesome. The characters are rendered in a full 1990s fantasy novel cover art-style, but each character has benefited from the two to three decades of computer game character design in the intervening years.</p>
<p>The animations are extensive. In the background, light beams move and a crackling orb of magical energy sparks. The reels are animated with a feeling of weight in the spins, a feeling that is amplified by clever use of sound effects and music.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Rosh Immortality Cube is built using the Megaways system.</p>
<p>This uses six reels. Each spin, the number of symbols on each reel is randomised to between two and seven. This is coupled with an any way wins system.</p>
<p>This means that winning combinations are formed by matching symbols in adjacent reels starting from reel one. The Megaways combination of randomised row numbers and any way wins payouts results in between 128 and 117,649 ways to win for each spin.</p>
<p>The Megaways system uses cascades. This means winning combinations are removed from the reels, new symbols drop down from above, and any new wins are calculated. This continues until there are no new wins and the spin ends.</p>
<p>Rosh Immortality Cube also sports a variety of bonuses to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>The overall result of this is a fast paced and constantly engaging style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols in the base game except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three Scatters anywhere on the reels during a single spin trigger one of three bonuses: the Mystery Multiplier Bonus, Mystery Cube Bonus, or Mystery Ways Bonus.</p>
<p>The Mystery Multiplier Bonus simply pays out a randomised multiple of the player's bet. The Mystery Cube Bonus adds 12 mystery cubes that transform into random symbols, giving the player another shot at making winning combos for free. The Mystery Ways Bonus gives the player three free spins with each spin having an increasing number of win ways (controlled by the number of symbols per reel).</p>
<p>The big bonus is the Free Spin Bonus. This is triggered by landing four or more Scatter symbols on one spin.</p>
<p>Free Spins use a completely new set of reels made up entirely of multipliers and blanks.</p>
<p>At the end of the Free Spins, the player receives a payout equal to the total of the multipliers added together. If the player lands a Mystery Cube during the free spins, the cube transforms into one of three symbols: Mystery Double which doubles all the multipliers on the reels at that time, Mystery Collect which collects all the multipliers on the reel and adds them to its total, and Mystery Removal which removes the lowest multipliers without affecting the player’s total and thereby freeing space up for further symbols to land.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game 96.15%, a touch over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€.0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€200.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Rosh Immortality Cube has a certain appeal right off the bat thanks to its stats. High volatility and an above average RTP make it ideal for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>When this is coupled with a set of graphics and gameplay mechanics as sophisticated and engrossing as this one, it thrills us no end.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this slot.</p>
