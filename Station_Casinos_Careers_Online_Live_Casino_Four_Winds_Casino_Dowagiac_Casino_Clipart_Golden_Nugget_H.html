    <h1>Station Casinos Careers Online Live Casino Four Winds Casino Dowagiac Casino Clipart Golden Nugget H</h1>

<p>Thank you for your explanation and supporting data, Nick and Slot Madness.</p>
<p>Dear ericfiorezollo,</p>
<p>Nick's claims and the casino's decision were fully substantiated with the relevant evidence.</p>
<p>There was another account you created a significant time before the disputed account was registered (the same basic personal information but a different email/phone number/address was used), where a no-deposit bonus was used. It is possible that the casino would have been able to reconsider its decision if you first made a deposit to the disputed account, and then claimed and used the no-deposit bonus in question. But, you made only a verification deposit after you accumulated winnings from the no-deposit bonus. So, you used at least 2 consecutive no-deposit bonuses without making a deposit between them. Therefore, it would not be possible to withdraw anything from your disputed winnings collected in this way, because they are invalid.</p>
<p>It is the players' obligation to read the terms and conditions before accepting them. Moreover, we are talking about no-deposit bonuses and free money. The casinos can limit this free money as they see fit unless it is not against our Fair Gambling Codex. The ideal case would be if casinos enforce their rules by software. But, currently, it is not an industry standard, so we are able to accept such procedures. In addition, it is understandable that no casino just gives their players only free money until they win so they can withdraw their winnings. If it was allowed, it would not make sense for online casinos to offer their services/no-deposit bonuses at all.</p>
<p>So we are talking about multiple violations of the casino's Terms and Conditions - more than 1 account registered at the casino, and at least 2 consecutive no-deposit bonuses used without making a deposit.</p>
<p>If the circumstances were a bit different (only winnings from real money solely, or there were not so many altered details in your casino account profile), maybe we could do something. But in case of a breach of the casino's bonus rules, while the disputed winnings were accumulated only with a no-deposit bonus that you were basically not eligible for, there is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>The questions are as follows:</p>
<p>Do you please know about the rules in the casino's Terms and Conditions that prohibit more than 1 no-deposit bonus without making a deposit? Did you know about another existing account you registered at the casino in the past or you forgot about it?</p>
<p>Can you please confirm that your deposit was refunded successfully?</p>
