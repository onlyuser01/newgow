<p>NFC Sunday Night Showdown Between Packers and Niners Highlights NFL Week 12</p>

<p>The Green Bay Packers (8-2) against the San Francisco 49ers (9-1) on Sunday Night Football will cap off an exciting and busy day in Week 12 that will result in a clearer playoff picture – especially in the NFC.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers will look to upset the Niners at home. The Pack are currently an underdog by a field goal, and the over/under is at 48 points.</p>
<p>The Sunday Night Football game of the week features the NFC’s top two seeds. Green Bay, which plays man coverage on defense the majority of the time, might need to reconsider that game plan against San Francisco’s Jimmy Garoppolo. The Niners QB ranks in the top five in the NFL in completion rate, yards per drop back, and total QBR against man coverage.</p>
<p>Regardless of Sunday’s outcome, both teams are seeming locks to make the postseason. The DraftKings sportsbook has Green Bay and San Francisco both at -2000 to make the playoffs. On those odds, a $100 bet would net a measly $5.</p>
<p>Conversely, bettors can take +1000 odds that they won’t qualify for the NFC’s top six. A $100 bet there would net $1,000 on that unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>Early Action</p>
<p>NFL fans can find plenty of earlier action with games featuring playoff implications.</p>
<p>At 1:00 pm ET, the Carolina Panthers (5-5) and New Orleans Saints (8-2) kickoff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Saints currently sit at No. 3 in the NFC, and are atop the NFC South. The Panthers trail in the division, and currently sit at No. 9 in the conference.</p>
<p>Carolina desperately needs a win on the road to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. Oddsmakers and bettors believe the Panthers will essentially be eliminated from postseason consideration Sunday, as the Saints are favored by 9.5 points.</p>
<p>Other Sunday NFL Odds Bucs vs. Falcons -3.5 Broncos vs. Bills -4 Giants vs. Bears -6 Raiders -3 vs. Jets Lions -3.5 vs. Redskins Jaguars vs. Titans -3.5</p>
<p>Another critical NFC Sunday game goes down in Philadelphia, as the 5-5 Eagles host the 8-2 Seattle Seahawks. Philly is a one-point favorite.</p>
<p>A loss would be devastating to the Eagles’ postseason chances. ESPN’s Football Power Index gives Philadelphia a 42 percent chance of making the playoffs, but a loss would greatly reduce that number.</p>
<p>In the AFC, the Cleveland Browns (4-6) and Pittsburgh Steelers (5-5) look to keep their Wild Card dreams alive, as the Baltimore Ravens (8-2) have run away with the division. The Browns are 10.5-point favorites at home against the 2-8 Miami Dolphins, and the Steelers are 6.5-point favorites at winless Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Cleveland and Pittsburgh are set to meet again next Sunday – just a little more than two weeks since the worst brawl in NFL history occurred between the two teams.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Picture</p>
<p>The New England Patriots (9-1) remain the sports betting favorite for Super Bowl 54. The Pats are favored by 6.5 points against visiting Dallas (6-4) Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>New England is at +270 to win the championship. The Ravens are next at +500, Saints third (+600), Niners fourth (+700), with the Kansas City Chiefs rounding out the top five (+1000).</p>
<p>Monday Night Football features the Ravens on the road in Los Angeles against the Rams (6-4). Baltimore is favored by a field goal.</p>
