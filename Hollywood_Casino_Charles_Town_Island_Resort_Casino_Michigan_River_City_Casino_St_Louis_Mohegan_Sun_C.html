<p>Pragmatic Play has stolen another march on the Latin American market with the supplier rolling out its full content portfolio across a number of jurisdictions in the region</p>
<p>This has been made possible through a tie-up with Enjoywin, a company with a strong regional presence that delivers content and products across both sports betting and iGaming. Enjoywin is set to benefit from three distinct vertical products made available by the supplier.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Strengthens LatAm Presence</p>
<p>Teaming up with Pragmatic Play will allow the company to significantly strengthen its presence and content library, ensuring that the operator and its players have access to leading games by a tier-one developer.</p>
<p>Enjoywin has been methodically building up its presence in the Latin American market in a bid to establish itself as a market leader, and these efforts will now be reinforced by exceptional casino games by Pragmatic, such as Rocket Blast Megaways, Diamond Cascade, Sugar Rush, and Gates of Olympus among others.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also delivering live casino games, the likes of Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Mega Wheel which will further strengthen Enjoywin’s game variety and library. Not least, the partnership will also cover Pragmatic Play’s Virtual Sports offering, which features options such as Greyhound Racing, Force 1, and other innovative and outside-the-box products.</p>
<p>Pragmatic was similarly excited to be launching with Enjoywin as this significantly expands the supplier’s presence in the region, which has long been a focal point of business interest for the company. Pragmatic Play VP of Latin American Operations at ARRISE Victor Arias said that Enjoywin was indeed a fantastic brand to be collaborating with.</p>

<p>Juanena spoke highly of the type of games that Pragmatic Play brings onboard, including excellent table, slot, and live casino games, along with the company’s innovative virtual sports segments. Thanks to this collaboration, the operator now has a much stronger content proposition, Juanena concluded.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has also recently launched a number of excellent games that will be among the products being deployed with Enjoywin as well, including Pub Kings and Rocket Blast Megaways.</p>
