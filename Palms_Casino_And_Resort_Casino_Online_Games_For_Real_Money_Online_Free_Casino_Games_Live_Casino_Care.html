    <h1>Palms Casino And Resort Casino Online Games For Real Money Online Free Casino Games Live Casino Care</h1>

<p>Honestly, their customer support is beyond laughable. They claim to respond within 24 hours to an e-mail, but have they? Nope, it's been over a week (and that's being generous even considering it's holidays).</p>
<p>I e-mailed them to close my account.</p>
<p>Have they? Nope.</p>
<p>Have they even verified me after 10 days? Nope.</p>
<p>Did I lose more than I should have put in? Definitely.</p>
<p>Do I have a problem gambling? Considering I went to this site... yes.</p>
<p>Am I so stupid so put into a site with needlessly complicated withdrawal and deposits? Yes. They make it so you have to withdraw via the method you deposit, but naturally the method I used to deposit can't be withdrawn from so I had to make an account at one of those garbage money sends.</p>
<p>Did I get money in the end? Nope. Lost it in losing bets of course. Because of course sites can't be bothered to put the money on hold so I can't touch it.</p>
<p>This is generally why I try to to stick with bankid sites... lack of having to waste time verifying and typically painless withdrawals with actual safe gaming regulations.</p>
<p>Can't get verified (even after sending in all that paper, not that I want to stick with them).</p>
<p>Can't get my account closed.</p>
<p>What rubbish.</p>
<p>And their live odds were a pain to lock in, why would I want to auto accept changed odds since I will usually just get screwed hard regardless. (I mainly do sports, casino rarely).</p>
<p>Would have been nice to get at least something back so they could profit of my problem, but ya.</p>
