<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need some help regarding my deposit at parimatch casino.</p>
<p>On July 5 2023 I made a Btc deposit 0.01262987 that's equivalent INR 33787.63.I aslo paid a fee of Btc 0.0005 from my end.My Btc wallet showed recipient will get INR 33787.63 after the processing fee deduction.</p>
<p>The amount parimatch credited to my account was INR 31429.51 that's less INR 2358 from my actual deposit amount that I deposited from my Btc wallet.</p>
<p>I have been trying to get this resolved with parimatch for the last three weeks.</p>
<p>I have sent them all the proofs that I have regarding that transaction everything screenshots of the transection my Btc wallet information.</p>
<p>I aslo sent Hash ID of the transaction after I obtained it from my Btc wallet provider.</p>
<p>However they just keep asking me the same information over and over again.</p>
<p>They don't want to credit my missing deposit amount, they are just wasting my time.</p>
<p>I gave them all the proofs I have.It should not be difficult for them to just tally the Figures and find out the descrepency.</p>
<p>They have been wasting my time since July 5 2023 asking for same information that I have provided them million times already.</p>
<p>Kindly help to recover my missing deposit thank you.</p>
<p>I am not able to upload attachments there's an error everytime I try to upload attachments.I can send them to you at your email if that's Okay.</p>
<p>Thanks you</p>
<p>Rocky ****</p>
