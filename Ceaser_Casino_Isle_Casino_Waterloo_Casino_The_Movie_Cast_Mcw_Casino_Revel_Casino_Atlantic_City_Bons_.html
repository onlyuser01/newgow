    <h1>Ceaser Casino Isle Casino Waterloo Casino The Movie Cast Mcw Casino Revel Casino Atlantic City Bons</h1>

<p>10/3, I deposited ¥20,000-. The balance was gone, and then I deposited ¥100,000-, resulting in ¥170,000-, and at that stage I applied for a full withdrawal. Then it was put on hold. After 24 hours, there was no change, so I contacted chat, etc., but was told, "I will contact you by email, so please wait."</p>
<p>Then I got an email. Below is the content.</p>
<p>"Thank you for visiting our casino.</p>
<p>My name is Rena Mori from our screening department.</p>
<p>We will contact you regarding your account.</p>
<p>After you make a deposit, you make a small turnover and withdraw all the money after winning. And after that, it seems to continue the deposit game play again.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to trouble you, but I would appreciate it if you could explain such gameplay. "</p>
<p>Here is my reply.</p>
<p>"When I make a deposit and play, I either bet the full amount on the day and play until the balance is 0, or I enjoy winning more than the amount I deposited.</p>
<p>Basically, you play all the amount you deposited that day, withdraw if you win, and leave no balance if you lose. That's the style.</p>
<p>This time, I deposited ¥120,000-, resulting in a balance of ¥170,000-. This is a big win for me.</p>
<p>This time I won and applied for the above withdrawal. I want to separate.</p>
<p>Once you deposit, you will withdraw once, and when you play again, you will deposit and play again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. "</p>
<p>This is a reply to that email.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for using our casino. My name is Emi Kawasaki from our screening department. Thank you for your explanation. You will be charged.And then it seems that you will continue playing the Make Deposit again.This kind of action is considered payment method abuse.Please refrain from playing such games.We apologize for the inconvenience.We won. Later, if you want to play the game again, please do not withdraw the entire amount and leave a part of the balance for playing the game. is likely to be 10 times.Thank you very much."</p>
<p>I used to play and withdraw my winnings the same day, and I've done that several times at this casino. Nevertheless, I am confused that such a message came.</p>
<p>I received an instruction to withdraw part of the balance, so I applied for withdrawal of ¥160,000-, but it is still pending.</p>
<p>Am I responsible for this?</p>
