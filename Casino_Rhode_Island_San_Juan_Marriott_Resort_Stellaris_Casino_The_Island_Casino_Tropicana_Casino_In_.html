<p>By securing affiliate agreements with these sportsbooks, WagerWire can connect its community of bettors to them</p>
<p>WagerWire, the innovative sports betting platform, has announced that it has entered into affiliate agreements with nine prominent sports betting operators, including BetMGM, Caesars, SuperBook Sports, Unibet, Tipico, RSI’s BetRivers &amp; SugarHouse, and 888’s SISportsbook, with more to be announced soon.</p>
<p>WagerWire Launches In-House Media Network and Mobile App for Partner Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The affiliate agreements will enable WagerWire to onboard its community of bettors to these partner sportsbooks through its original in-house content produced by its recently launched media network and soon-to-be-launched mobile app. The company’s content is shared on social media channels and hosted on the Community Page of its website, which is home to unique insights, viewpoints, and written commentaries created by members of its rapidly growing community.</p>
<p>Zach Doctor, co-founder and CEO of WagerWire, commented on the latest development, saying “This is an exciting milestone and represents the achievement of the next step in the roadmap of our media network. The addition of these iconic brands to our partnership group sets a strong foundation for the next phase of our growth and the rollout of our betting marketplace.”</p>
<p>WagerWire’s commitment to regulatory compliance is reflected in its successful application and approval for vendor affiliate licenses in a number of gaming states prior to beginning services. WagerWire is now authorized to operate in 16 states, D.C., Ontario, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Investors and Partnerships Fuel WagerWire’s Success</p>
<p>WagerWire has been successful in the industry since it announced its seed round in July 2022 from investors such as Miami Marlins co-owner Roger Ehrenberg, Betr &amp; Simplebet founder Joey Levy, and NBA All-Star Richard Jefferson among others.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has launched a community-driven content network that receives over 10 million impressions a month, announced partnerships with Sparket and Wagr, and released multiple data findings from a survey of bettors and non-bettors that discovered that education was the biggest barrier for would-be sports bettors.</p>
<p>In recognition of its rapid accomplishments in the industry, WagerWire has been shortlisted among industry giants for SBC North America’s Sports Affiliate of the Year Award 2023. A hand-picked judging panel from the top of the industry will determine this year’s winners on May 11 at the New York Hilton Midtown.</p>
<p>WagerWire’s community-driven approach, focused on education, responsibility, and fun, has been warmly received by sports bettors, and the addition of these iconic brands to its partnership group signals exciting growth for the platform.</p>
