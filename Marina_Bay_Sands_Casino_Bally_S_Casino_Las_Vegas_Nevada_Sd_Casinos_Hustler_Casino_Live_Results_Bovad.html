<p>The new agreement will help AWARE expand the reach of its leading biometric software solutions that provide efficiencies for online gambling operators</p>
<p>The premier management advisory firm, delivering solutions and software for the sports betting, online gambling and casino sector, SCCG Management, has announced a new strategic partnership. The company revealed it joined forces with the world leader in biometric verification software solutions, AWARE. Under the terms of the new agreement, SCCG will help expand the reach of AWARE’s superior biometric software solutions, allowing new operators across the globe to benefit from them.</p>
<p>Per the new collaboration, AWARE’s solutions will be able to reach new partners that will benefit from its innovative know-your-customer (KYC) technology. At the same time SCCG will stay at the forefront of innovation by delivering groundbreaking solutions that help with authentication and identity verification. Additionally, AWARE’s solutions are renowned for their secure biometric enrollment, enabling seamless transactions and logins. Those ground-breaking solutions lead by example, setting a new standard for the online gambling sector.</p>
<p>Only recently, SCCG Management signed another important deal. Last week, the company revealed it signed a strategic agreement with Snapscreen Inc., a New York and Australia-based technology company. Under the terms of that collaboration, SCCG gained access to Snapscreen’s SnapOdds, an innovative live betting video recognition technology. The unique technology enables bettors and sports fans to be able to identify live sports events by taking a snapshot and engaging in in-game betting.</p>
<p>The Strategic Agreement Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Dave Barcelo, AWARE’s CFO, highlighted the importance of the new agreement and the benefits it will bring to the two companies. He spoke about the frictionless logins that the company’s technology delivers.</p>
<p>Additionally, Barcelo said that AWARE will be delighted to help online gambling operators ensure security compliance while improving the experience for their customers. “AWARE has partnered with SCCG, and their vast experience in the global iGaming industry, to accelerate our reach and work with operators to incorporate biometric verification technology to strengthen platforms around the world,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring AWARE’s best-in-class biometric software solutions to the global gambling industry.“ Stephen Crystal, founder and CEO of SCCG Management</p>
<p>Stephen Crystal, SCCG’s founder and CEO, was similarly delighted to see the company join forces with AWARE and deliver supreme software solutions for the iGaming sector. Moreover, he explained that SCCG is in a perfect position to help distribute AWARE’s leading KYC solutions through its network of operators.
