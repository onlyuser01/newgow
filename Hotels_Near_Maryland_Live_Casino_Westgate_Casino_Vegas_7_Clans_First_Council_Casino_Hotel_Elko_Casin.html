<p>Max Verstappen Expected to Have an Easy Job on June 4</p>
<p>There were six Formula 1 races so far in 2023, and Max Verstappen finished on the podium in each of those. In fact, the reigning F1 champ won four of those events. If he continues to win, the Dutchman will get a chance to break the record for the most dominant season in the history of the sport. So, will he continue his dominance on Sunday, June 4?</p>
<p>Bookmakers definitely think so, giving the 2023 Spanish GP odds of just -275 for Verstappen winning. The Red Bull Racing superstar won this event last year, finishing 13.072 seconds before his teammate Sergio Perez.</p>
<p>Both of them, however, felt kind of lucky to get the two top spots on the podium. The thing is that Charles Leclerc – the pole-sitter – was forced to withdraw from the race. Further, Lewis Hamilton too had some problems with his car but was able to finish the race, albeit far behind his rivals.</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton Just Loves the Spanish GP</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Verstappen as a huge favorite to triumph on Sunday, with his Red Bull colleague Sergio Perez sitting second on the list of favorites. Fernando Alonso is the third-favorite, as well as the last driver with odds shorter than +1000.</p>
<p>However, we doubt that either of them can cause trouble for Verstappen. Still, there’s one driver that could do it. It’s no other than Lewis Hamilton, the man sharing the top spot on the list of most successful Spanish GP drivers with legendary Michael Schumacher. Each of them has won the race on six occasions.</p>
<p>Actually, since the event moved to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Hamilton’s been, by far, the most successful driver. The Englishman won the race for the first time in 2014. Then, after a two-year break, he went on to win the Spanish GP five straight times.</p>
<p>Last year, he suffered a puncture after contact with Kevin Magnussen’s car. As a result, he ended up in 19th place at one point and was considering retirement. Nevertheless, he continued the race, eventually finishing in fifth place. After the race, Hamilton shared his satisfaction regarding the comeback, saying it made him feel better than a win.</p>
<p>2023 Spanish Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>It would be crazy not to think of Max Verstappen as the favorite to win the 2023 Spanish GP. It’s very, very likely he’s going to win. However, if there’s a driver that could ruin his plans, it’s Lewis Hamilton. Sure, he probably won’t win, but we can see him ending up on the podium in the end.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Lewis Hamilton to finish in the top 3</p>
