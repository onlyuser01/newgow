    <h1>Casino Tequila New Online Casinos Usa Wild Wild West Casino Victory Casino Cruises San Manuel Indian</h1>

<p>Hi Petronella,</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick response. Let me explain. I always play with one kind of bonus as it gives me more money to play with - even though with a AUD300 deposit the wavering can be 20,000 - which is fine - you just keep playing, winning, losing and every now and then you check your WITHDRAWABLE BALANCE. And when you are lucky enough to get to a point that your withdrawable balance is showing a figure to withdraw - you surely expect that amount to come to your bank account.</p>
<p>BUT not with TrueBlue... The figure they give you as a withdrawable balance is NOT the actual figure you'll get to your account. As I said in my complaint I had 2x AUD2500 withdrawal in a couple of days and almost half was deducted from it by the time I got it.</p>
<p>From the first withdrawal I got $1676 and when I questioned them on LiveChat I was told that for the second $2500 withdrawal I'll get $1260.</p>
<p>To me this is just not right. We, players wouldn't know and would be happy to play and try more - if the casino has something more to deduct for bonus wagering, insurance, whatnot.. - but the point is that when I see that screen that the withdrawable amount is such and such - I surely expect THAT amount on my account. I tried to explain this issue to them several times - with apparently no result.</p>
<p>They should change their software as it's certainly NOT good for the players.</p>
<p>I really hope that you are able to do something about this with TrueBlue.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Gabriella</p>
