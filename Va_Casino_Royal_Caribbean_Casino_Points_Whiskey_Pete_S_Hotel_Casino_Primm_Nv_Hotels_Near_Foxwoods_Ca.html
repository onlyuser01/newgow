    <h1>Va Casino Royal Caribbean Casino Points Whiskey Pete S Hotel Casino Primm Nv Hotels Near Foxwoods Ca</h1>

<p>Good day. Please help withdraw funds.</p>
<p>Registered at this casino on 23/03/2022. Played only in slots, without bonuses and free spins. Only at their own expense.</p>
<p>He first made three deposits of UAH 1,000 + 700 + 2,400.</p>
<p>Won 17053 hryvnias. He applied for withdrawal of funds. Asked if you need documents in the support and withdrawal time. They said that I would receive an answer by e-mail.</p>
<p>Then he made 5 more deposits: 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 2000 + 3000 + canceled the withdrawal request. He played, unscrewed his deposits several times. After there were 19587 hryvnias left on the account, he created an application for payment of 19400 hryvnias.</p>
<p>The next day I received a message in the mail about the verification. I sent all the necessary documents (ID card, bank statements, which contain all the data). The account was verified, but the payment request was canceled.</p>
<p>Then I made 4 more deposits: 500 + 1000 + 1500 + 1300. Played, played.</p>
<p>Created an application for payment on 25/03/2022 01:39 of the night in the amount of UAH 31,413.</p>
<p>The next day I asked the caliper when the application would be processed. To which I was told that applications are processed 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>I made 3 more deposits (1000 + 2000 + 3400) so as not to cancel the application, but to play. He lost this money.</p>
<p>After 48 hours of creating the application, I turned to support again. I was told that the application is currently being processed.</p>
<p>It's been 57 hours, I wrote in the mail. I was told that they could not name the exact date of processing the application.</p>
<p>Help please. I have all screenshots of deposits, correspondence and letters.</p>
