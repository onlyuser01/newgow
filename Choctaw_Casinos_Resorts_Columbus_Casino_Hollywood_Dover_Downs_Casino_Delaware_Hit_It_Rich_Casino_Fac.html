<p>Effective February 1, EveryMatrix’s co-founder, Stian Hornsletten, will move to the position of chief executive officer of the company’s Games division</p>
<p>The bold iGaming provider leading the way with innovative solutions, EveryMatrix, has announced that its co-founder, Stian Hornsletten, will move to the position of chief executive officer of the Games division at the start of next month.</p>
<p>The news comes after the WLA Safer Gambling–certified company appointed Nikolina Gabelica as the new head of lottery earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The Move, Ahead of ICE London 2024</p>
<p>From his new position as CEO, Hornsletten will manage the Games team right ahead of the much-anticipated ICE London 2024 that will return at ExCeL London on February 6-8.</p>
<p>The event will once again reunite representatives of the gaming industry over the course of three days packed with education and networking.</p>
<p>ICE London 2024 visitors will be able to visit EveryMatrix representatives at the stand N6-210.</p>
<p>Hornsletten to Keep His Active Senior Role on the Board</p>
<p>The new CEO of the Games division will focus on “driving both in-house development and third-party content partnerships” which should also feature building on the provider’s worldwide distribution network and exclusive content.</p>
<p>In parallel, Hornsletten will preserve his active senior position on the company’s board.</p>
<p>As a former chief commercial officer, he has been one of the main actors behind EveryMatrix’s commercial strategy and product development in the past decade and a half, carrying the business from a simple vision to one of the quickest-developing, most trustworthy suppliers of technology in the iGaming world.</p>
<p>He has also helped attract some of the biggest brands and convinced them to integrate EveryMatrix’s state-of-the-art software and services.</p>
<p>As one of the most prominent figures in the industry in the last 20 years, Hornsletten has employed his leadership skills and rich knowledge to help the company turn into a global leader in terms of tier-1 technology suppliers.</p>
<p>The CCO position will be filled shortly. EveryMatrix has announced it will soon appoint someone who will be responsible for the commercial department and who will also closely collaborate with every business unit to improve the company’s international efforts.</p>
<p>The group’s chief executive officer, Ebbe Groes, praised Hornsletten for his crucial role in making EveryMatrix become a reality while expressing his gratefulness for discussing the idea of “starting the business together 15 years ago.”</p>
<p>Groes added that Hornsletten would benefit from all his support as well as the full support of the company while expressing his belief that he would “immediately” take EveryMatrix to a new level while breathing his amazing energy, passion, and innovation into the crew.</p>
<p>Last November, EveryMatrix announced a deal with Caesars Digital to help with its growth plans in North America.</p>
<p>Earlier in the same month, the company published its Q3 2023 results that reaffirmed its growth trajectory.</p>
