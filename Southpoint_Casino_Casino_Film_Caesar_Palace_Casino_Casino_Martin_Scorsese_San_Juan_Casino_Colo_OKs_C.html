<p>Colorado Commission Approves Century Casinos, Circa, and GeoComply for Sports Betting Licenses</p>

<p>Even with little on the horizon for sports in the US, sports betting took another step forward in Colorado Thursday when the state’s Limited Gaming Control Commission awarded licenses to several applicants at special called meeting.</p>

<p>Sports betting, which Colorado voters approved in a referendum last November, is set to launch on May 1. It’s likely few, if any, sportsbooks will open then, as the COVID-19 outbreak has shut down casinos across the country.</p>
<p>Century Casinos, Inc., noted its received approval for three sports betting master licenses. The licenses will allow the company’s Cripple Creek and Central City locations to work with a licensed retail sportsbook, a licensed online sports betting provider, or a licensee that can provide both retail and online sports betting operations.</p>
<p>In a statement, Century said it’s in “active negotiations” with several potential partners for two of the licenses.</p>
<p>Others that applied for First Master licenses include Johnny Nolon’s Casino in Cripple Creek, The Lodge Casino at Black Hawk, The Gilpin Hotel Casino in Black Hawk, Bull Durham Saloon and Casino in Black Hawk, and the Red Dolly Casino in Black Hawk.</p>
<p>Century Partner Circa Also Approved</p>
<p>One sportsbook with which Century already has an agreement in place is Las Vegas-based Circa Sports. The companies announced the 15-year deal back in February that will allow Circa to offer an online sportsbook.</p>
<p>The Commission granted Circa Sports a temporary online operator license at Thursday’s meeting.</p>
<p>Due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sports betting industry, the Company is uncertain of the timeline that the Circa Sports mobile sports betting app will launch,” Century Casinos noted in its statement.</p>
<p>Among the other companies that received approval for temporary online licenses were Roar Digital, William Hill, Rush Street Interactive, Smarkets, and Penn Sports Interactive.</p>
<p>William Hill and Roar Digital, which operates the Bet MGM sportsbook brand, also received license approval for retail sportsbooks. William Hill’s licenses will cover the Isle of Capri and Lady Luck casinos, both of which are located in Black Hawk.</p>
<p>GeoComply Approved for Geofencing License</p>
<p>Among the companies that sought vendor minor licensing was GeoComply Solutions.</p>
<p>The Vancouver, Canada-based company will provide geolocation services to its clients. By getting the state’s approval, Geocomply will be able to offer their solution to licensed online sportsbooks in Colorado and ensure their customers are physically located within the state at the time they’re trying to place a bet.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be approved to service our clients and partners in such a sports-driven market as Colorado,” says Lindsay Slader, VP of Regulatory Affairs at GeoComply. “The GeoComply team is prepared and ready to support the rollout of online sports betting as quickly as the state is able to launch its live operations.”</p>
<p>Geocomply works in 44 US states to guarantee iGaming, online poker, mobile sports betting, and other forms of gaming are played properly under state and federal guidelines.</p>
