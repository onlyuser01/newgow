<p>The changes to Kindred's C-suite continue with two new executives reportedly planning to leave the company after the recent appointment of interim CEO</p>
<p>Globally recognized entertainment and gaming company Kindred confirmed last week that its long-term CEO, Henrik Tjärnström, resigned from his role. The company didn’t wait long and announced the appointment of Nils Andén to the role of interim CEO, while the search for a permanent holder of the position likely has started as well. Kindred did not reveal a reason for the sudden departure of Tjärnström. Upon announcing his resignation, he said: “I am very pleased with the Board of Directors’ choice of Nils Andén as the interim CEO, guaranteeing a smooth hand over.”</p>
<p>Before Tjärnström’s resignation, Kindred also unveiled another C-suite departure. Earlier this month, the company confirmed that it plans to part ways with its chief financial officer (CFO), Johan Wilsby. At the time of the announcement Kindred did not point out a specific reason for that senior-level change, neither said who may fill in the role. Wilsby is expected to leave the company at some point this autumn, but a specific date for his departure wasn’t pointed out previously.</p>
<p>Now, more senior-level executives are reportedly planning to leave Kindred. A report released by CasinoBeats suggests that the company’s chief commercial officer (CCO), Anne-Jaap Snijders, as well as chief marketing officer (CMO), Elen Barber, plan to vacate their roles. Similar to the announcement about Wilsby, the duo plan to step down at some point this autumn.</p>
<p>C-Suite Departures Are Not Related, Says Kindred</p>
<p>Barber was a part of Kindred for more than a decade. She initially joined the company back in 2010 as a global affiliate manager. But Barber’s professional experience with Kindred includes senior-level roles such as head of digital advertising, head of performance marketing and head of affiliates. To the role of CMO, she was appointed back in January 2019.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to have played my part in Kindred’s success over the past 13 years.“ Elen Barber, chief marketing officer at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Snijders is another veteran with a decade of experience at Kindred. He first joined the company as general manager of Australia with Unibet Group in 2012. This happened before the rebranding of the company to Kindred. Throughout his professional career with the company, Snijders’ held different senior-level roles before he was appointed to CCO in 2019.</p>
<p>“I had a great time at Kindred.“ Anne-Jaap Snijders, chief commercial officer at Kindred</p>
<p>According to Kindred, the two newly announced departures are not related to the departure of Wilsby or Tjärnström announced previously. The company thanked Barber and Snijders for their dedication, support and “huge contributions” throughout their extensive career.</p>
