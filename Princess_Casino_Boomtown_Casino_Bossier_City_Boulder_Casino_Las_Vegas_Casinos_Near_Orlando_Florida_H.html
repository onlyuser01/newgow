<p>The leading provider of premium live dealer casino content, Stakelogic Live, announced its entry into the regulated gambling market in the UK.</p>
<p>Gambling Commission Grants Stakelogic Live Supplier Permit</p>
<p>The announcement came today and follows a supplier permit that the operator received from the gambling regulator in the country, the Gambling Commission. Thanks to the recent supplier permit, Stakelogic Live can now roll out its products for the very first time in the regulated market in the UK. The Commission’s permit allows Stakelogic Live to introduce its portfolio of content for leading operators already active in the country. What’s more, the entry in the UK expands the reach of Stakelogic Live. The company is currently active in two other jurisdictions – Malta and the Netherlands – where it has joined forces with the likes of Unibet, the largest online gambling operator in Europe.</p>
<p>“This is a pivotal milestone on our journey to becoming the leading provider of live casino content to operators in regulated markets around the world.“ Stephan van den Oetelaar, CEO of Stakelogic</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, Stakelogic’s CEO, said in a statement that the company’s entry into the UK marks an important milestone for the company on its way to solidifying its presence as a global go-to live casino content provider. He explained that the market in the UK is strictly regulated and the recent entry reaffirms the quality of Stakelogic’s content. At the same time, Oetelaar acknowledged that the company’s live casino content will help operators take their live offering to the next level.</p>
<p>“Our live dealer titles really are a cut above those of our rivals, allowing operators to strengthen their live casino offering with games that engage and entertain in equal measure,“ added Oetelaar</p>
<p>Acknowledging that its content quality is well above its competitors, Oetelaar said that Stakelogic’s portfolio of games offers the perfect balance between engagement and entertainment. The company’s CEO thanked the entire team that contributed to the license permit approval from the Gambling Commission. According to Oetelaar, Stakelogic’s live dealer content will be well received and the UK will be a major market for the company. In conclusion, he predicted further success for the company in the UK, just as it has seen in other regulated markets.</p>
<p>The Developer Offers Unique Live Casino Entertainment</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s content is streamed from dedicated studios located in the Netherlands and Malta. Using high-definition cameras, quality microphones and experienced dealers, the company creates a unique casino-like online experience. Additionally, the company’s streaming studios use luxurious backgrounds that resemble casino venues, further boosting the experience for the online players.</p>
<p>The company has already joined forces with leading operators such as Kansino, Betcity and Unibet. Its latest innovative feature for the live dealer space is called Super Stake. The unique product for the market was developed by Stakelogic Live’s parent company Stake Logic and offers an experience unlike anything else offered in the live casino market.</p>
