<p>Colorado, which recently welcomed Tipico Sportsbook, and a new development hub in Denver, is definitely enjoying the football season. In fact, the Centennial State managed to collect a record-breaking betting handle, posting $491.5 million in October, strengthened by local franchises, college games, and professional football.</p>
<p>The results are bolstered by both the National Football League and college football games that have been going strong in the state. In comparative terms, the results are up 20% from September, and the handle doubled year-over-year when compared to October 2020.</p>
<p>The numbers are all verified by the Colorado Division of Gaming which published them on Tuesday and broke down how sports events had influenced betting in the state. Over a third of all wagers in October were placed on the NFL, with the local franchise, the Denver Broncos, still galvanizing many people into action despite a poor one-out-of-five win during the month. A total of $167.7 was collected on football.</p>
<p>Basketball wagers on the NBA came in second with $63.3 million in wagers, and college football managed to fetch another $52 million in total bets. Colorado has embraced both professional and collegiate-level bets. Put together, the football bets in both categories accounted for close half of the total betting action for the month.</p>
<p>Local Franchises Spur Fans into Action</p>
<p>Both the Colorado Avalanche and the Denver Nuggets, paired with the Broncos, contributed to an upsurge in the sports betting handle. Residents donâ€™t so much care about winning as they do about back their favorite team, and there are many of those to go around in Colorado.</p>
<p>The Broncos are still struggling, but they have been enjoying a good build-up with their fan bases. This trend should extend through the Super Bowl, as the season will be packed with more games, just like in October.</p>
<p>Baseball accounted for some $37.4 million of the total bets. Soccer, represented by the MLS Colorado Rapids, tennis, and hockey together added for another $43.1 million in total wagers. Bets on unspecified sports amounted to $34.7 million, and parlays and accumulators accounted for $90 million of the betting handle.</p>
<p>Operators in the state ended up paying some $462.8 million to bettors, bringing $9.79 million for the sportsbooks, with the state biting out $1.25 million out of this amount in a tax form. Tax from sports betting has been put to good use in the state, bolstering various important infrastructural projects.</p>
