<p>The prominent content and iGaming solutions provider, 7777 gaming, has deployed its product portfolio with a new and trusted operator</p>
<p>The company has launched its product portfolio with Win2, a new iGaming brand that has rolled out its products in the Romanian online casino market. 7777 is bringing a comprehensive offering that includes games, gamification and marketing tools, tournaments, cash drops, and much more to make Win2 a worthwhile option for local players.</p>
<p>Win2 Determined to Conquer the Romanian Market</p>
<p>The company is already deploying 70 games and has operated its titles in the market with proven success. This new collaboration will allow Win2 to secure a footprint in the market and quickly scale its presence, even as a new company.</p>
<p>7777 gaming account manager Larisa Karaboycheva welcomed the opportunity to see this partnership form in the market and said:</p>
<p>Our partnership with Win2 adds another level of excitement to our team. This is the second integration for us that goes live in Romania and is incremental for our success as an all-in-one B2B iGaming provider on the market. We are moving fast on the Romanian market with many new deals coming their way.</p>
<p>The collaboration was naturally welcomed by Win2 CEO Plamen Milanov who said that the company was indeed excited to be launching in the Romanian market, and with the help of 7777 not least.</p>
<p>Growth Driven by Quality Gaming Products</p>
<p>“Their platform, marketing solutions, and unique games have made it easy for us to grow our audience in the Romanian market, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with them as we continue to grow,” Milanov added.</p>
<p>7777 gaming is deploying a number of its titular and player-favorite games, including Sea of Treasures, Jinn Greenhats’ Jackpot, Club Mr. Luck and Zeus Quest, which are some of the company’s more innovative products.</p>
<p>7777 gaming will also be introducing its products and extensive gaming portfolio at the upcoming SBC Summit Barcelona event which will see a number of the aforementioned games get the limelight at the company’s booth at the Fira de Barcelona.</p>
