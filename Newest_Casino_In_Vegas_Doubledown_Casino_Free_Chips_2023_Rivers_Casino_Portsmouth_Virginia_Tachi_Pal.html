    <h1>Newest Casino In Vegas Doubledown Casino Free Chips 2023 Rivers Casino Portsmouth Virginia Tachi Pal</h1>

<p>Amelco, a company that provides technology for sportsbook, casino, lottery, and financial operations across the gambling industry, has achieved another milestone by securing a roll-out in New Jersey, the United States.</p>
<p>The launch sees the company roll out its entire platform portfolio which leverages advanced in-house technological solutions along with gamification features, and games from established studios from the industry.</p>
<p>Among the titles that Amelco partner operators can access are games by Light &amp; Wonder, Pariplay, IGT, and Evolution. These games are part of the comprehensive offer that Amelco brings to its partner operators who benefit from dynamic content that is adjustable, tailored to meet consumer needs, and grants brands a lot of room to cater to player tastes.</p>
<p>Welcoming this launch in New Jersey, Amelco’s Head of USA, Brandon Walker, said that the company was very excited to be establishing its footprint in yet another regulated iGaming jurisdiction.</p>
<p>"This is a great opportunity for us to see where we stand in terms of our casino offering. Our award-winning sportsbook is already live across 15 states, so we are excited to showcase our solution in such a competitive environment," Walker said.</p>
<p>Walker argued that Amelco is already an established leader of platform solutions in the United States, and it’s committed to expanding further. Amelco is a leader with such gamification and engagement solutions as Bonus Engine as others.</p>
<p>Amelco has been building up its content library to offer to potential partners in the United States, teaming up with various suppliers in order to continue delivering advanced solutions to licensed and regulated operators.</p>
<p>The company has been keen to expand well beyond the United States as well, however, with the company launching with LulaBet in South Africa, the company’s debut in the region, and a "game changer" for its international operations.</p>
