<p>GambleAware is in the process of adding two new members to the Live Experience Council</p>
<p>The independent UK-based charity’s Lived Experience Council (LEC) which was officially introduced to the public in December 2022 has been designed for up to 12 members, including the chair. At the moment, the council is missing two members.</p>
<p>Accordingly, GambleAware has announced it is ready to receive applicants interested in joining the group of people who have been directly or indirectly impacted by gambling harms.</p>
<p>Young Adults Ages 18-25 Are Encouraged to Apply</p>
<p>GambleAware is interested in seeing all communities being accurately represented on the LEC.</p>
<p>This is why their new ideal recruits are young adults ages 18 to 25 who have been disproportionately affected by the harms associated with problem gambling.</p>
<p>The group, which is currently missing the right type of representation, is ready to welcome Welsh residents, minority group representatives, people who suffer from a disability, and individuals who belong to groups that have been ostracized by society.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in sharing their story and using it as a source of inspiration for anyone trying to recover from gambling harm is welcome to apply for the new council position openings.</p>
<p>The recruits will need to be able to recount their stories and explain the way their gambling habits or those of their relatives or friends have posed an impact on them.</p>
<p>LEC’s chair Ben Howard spoke about the two new seat openings, expressing his excitement for being “involved in the strategic development of GambleAware” by reuniting versatile voices including those who have personally experienced gambling harm and individuals affected by other person’s gambling habits.</p>
<p>Ready to Engage with New and Valuable Members</p>
<p>Howard also spoke about the amazing efforts made by the LEC since its formation while expressing their thrill to be able to engage with fresh members and usher them into the “vital” process of cutting and handling the risk of gambling harm.</p>
<p>The new members of the LEC will also automatically become important community ambassadors who will be used to set a good example among their peers and their local communities.</p>
<p>GambleAware plans to keep staying committed to changing people’s lives using the lived experiences of gambling harm while putting the limelight on the right people.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through LEC, the charity wishes to generate a community made of individuals with a deeper knowledge and understanding of all gambling harms that result from their personal issues with gambling.</p>
<p>This way, more trust can be built and more insight can be obtained and used to form fresh long-term term GambleAware policies for lawmakers and stakeholders.</p>
