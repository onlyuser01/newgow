    <h1>Aurora Hollywood Casino Caesars Palace Las Vegas Hotel Casino Casinos In Bahamas Casinos In Florida</h1>

<p>I just recently made multiple deposits and won big off a $30 bitcoin deposit and got it up to $2900 and redeemed $2500 and after one business day my an email came in From the financial department her name was Annalise and she informed me that I had broken the rules that I had redeemed and the bonus during a pendant pending redemption and that was not allowed but had made an exception and informed me that they were going to steal process my winnings but had warned me in the future if I do make it redemption and while it’s pending I claim any bonuses they will void my winnings that was a mistake on my part are casinos have different policies in the terms and conditions and I should’ve educated myself and made myself familiar with the rules and I seen that this is happened to several people that have posted luckily I’m not one of those people that didn’t get paid this is the first time I casino has bent the rules for me I’ve had problems with different casinos for different reasons for being so close to losing so much any casino I make a deposit on I will definitely read the terms and conditions on that note why can’t they just make it where you can’t redeem any bonuses while pending a redemption it’s almost like a trap of course you don’t want to cancel your withdrawal to play so you find other ways maybe claiming your comps points or maybe claiming a special bonus that you got an email but I’m sure they have the ability to set it up to where you’re not allowed to redeem any bonuses or make any deposits oh yeah you can’t make any deposits either while a redemption is pending overall I’m gonna give this site five stars just for their compassion and understanding thanks FAIR GO CASINO!!!!!!!!!!</p>
