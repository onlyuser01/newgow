<p>The Knicks Looking for Their Fourth Straight Win Over the Cavs</p>
<p>Even though they finished lower in the Eastern Conference standings than the Cavaliers, the Knicks did do great against this opponent in the regular season. They defeated the boys from Ohio in three of their four duels in the 2022-23 season.</p>
<p>The last time they met was in Cleveland and the visitors won 130-116. It happened on the last day of March when we saw Jalen Brunson score 48 points. It was his best performance of the season, during which he’s been struggling with all sorts of injuries. In fact, he still remains doubtful for Saturday’s game. He might play, but he probably won’t stay on the court for too long.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers Ready to Show How Good They Are Defensively</p>
<p>Even if Brunson plays for the Knicks on Saturday, this team is bound to struggle to score a lot of points. It’s because their opponents are terrific in defense.</p>
<p>In fact, Cleveland is the team that’s conceded the fewest number of points in the regular season. The Cavaliers were conceding just 106.9 points per game on average. In comparison, the Knicks were allowing 113.1 PPG.</p>
<p>The Cavs haven’t been too impressive scoring-wise, but they do have some amazing players on the roster. Donovan Mitchell looks like someone who can easily score 40 in a game (actually, he did do that a couple of times this season), but unfortunately, he’s struggling with a hand injury.</p>
<p>New York Knicks vs. Cleveland Cavaliers Prediction</p>
<p>One thing is certain, this is going to be a low-scoring game. But which team will win this encounter? Our vote goes to the Cavaliers. They’re the ones with a better roster, not to mention that the first game of the series is played on their turf.</p>
<p>Pick: Cleveland Cavaliers to win; under to hit</p>
