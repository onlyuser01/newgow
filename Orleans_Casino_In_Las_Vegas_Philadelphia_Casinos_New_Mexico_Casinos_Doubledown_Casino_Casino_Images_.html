    <h1>Orleans Casino In Las Vegas Philadelphia Casinos New Mexico Casinos Doubledown Casino Casino Images</h1>

<p>I used my comp points, which were worth $13.70, on May 27, 2023. I looked up the cop play regulations on their website, which stated that there was a $100 minimum withdrawal requirement and no maximum withdrawal as well as 30x wagering restrictions. After almost two hours of play, the jackpot feature in "mighty drums" occurred, and I won the grand prize. I have $7759.30 in both my real and withdrawable balances. Coindraw permits withdrawals of $2500 per week, according to a message I received. My balance was $5259.30 when I altered the amount to $2500.00, and it queued. It was not long before I realized I should take screen shots just in case an issue was to arise and upon checking my account, there was no balance. My $2500 withdrawal was still in the queue when I looked to my transactions, but there was a promo credit withdrawal that had been requested for $5259 and had been accepted for $5259. I contacted customer service via chat and i was told that when I requested the withdrawal, it removed my balance as it is non-cashable. As far as the $2500 withdrawal, I will receive only $100 because that is the maximum. I uploaded a snippet of the rules to our chat, and she put me on hold. Upon returning to our chat she said, I am sorry for the confusion but there is a mistake. The payout rule from comp points is 1x maximum. I asked her what she meant and if she implied there was a typo. She said, "I will forward this issue to the relevant team to update our terms &amp; conditions." I appreciate any help you can provide.</p>
