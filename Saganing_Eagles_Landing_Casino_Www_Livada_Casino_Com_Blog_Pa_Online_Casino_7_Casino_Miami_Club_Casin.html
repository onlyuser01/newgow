<p>Set on a Journey of Glitz and Glam</p>
<p>Meet the shiny and dime-y money-themed duo of the game, Bill and Coin, and join them on a fascinating and lucrative journey packed with glitz and glam.</p>
<p>Land the symbols at least three times during the base game and get ready to choose one of the three available rounds: Coin Track, Multiplier Ladder, and Sure Win Bonus.</p>
<p>During the Coin Track round, Enhancer and Collect symbols will boost the coins surrounding the reels, adding more to your winnings.</p>
<p>The round is initiated with the help of four coins seen on a coin track going around the reels. With each new spin, players are closer to landing enhancers, special collect and re-spin symbols that will further add more value to all the coins found on the track, or scoop up the values from all the available coins.</p>
<p>They can also enjoy an extra spin without having to move the coins from their positions.</p>
<p>While engaged in the Multiplier Ladder round, players will benefit from increased wins during each spin, up to a mouth-watering max multiplier of 500x.</p>
<p>The round begins with five spins and a 1x multiplier seen on the ladder. With each new win that players score, and also between the spins, the multiplier will keep going up. Landing a minimum of five bonus symbols will attract five extra spins.</p>
<p>Players eager to “go bold for gold” during the Sure Win Bonus round will see the baseline sum go up with each new success. The round is initiated with five spins and a Sure Win ranging between 0.2x and 50x the bet.</p>
<p>Scoring multiple wins during a spin will have the accumulated win multiplier boosted by the Sure Win. Once the spin is over, the Sure Win will stay active during the following spin.</p>
<p>The slot also features a Super version available for each of the three rounds, featuring extra Enhancer symbols and additions to the spin counter taking players to max wins of up to 10,000x.</p>
<p>The game, which counts 4,096 ways to win, joins the studio’s impressive collection of games counting over 4,000 online casino titles, including high-performing proprietary slots and third-party releases.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming exited 2023 after inking a partnership with Playbook Engineering, following its plans to extend its international reach.</p>
<p>The agreement followed the news that the studio would go live in New Jersey with the help of a fresh deal with BetMGM and a vendor transactional waiver with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
