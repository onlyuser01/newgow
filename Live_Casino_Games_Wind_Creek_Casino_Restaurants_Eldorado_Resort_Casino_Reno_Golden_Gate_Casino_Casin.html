<p>Digitain believes that the new office will help it raise the quality of services available to its European customers</p>
<p>Provider of sportsbook software and online casino gaming platform, Digitain, announced it has opened a new office in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
<p>Enhance Service Quality</p>
<p>The opening of Digitain’s new branch in the capital of Romania will allow the company to enhance the level of customer services it offers to a growing client base in the region and will further expand its footprint in Europe.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Harutyan Vardanyan, founder of Digitain, voiced the company’s excitement “to open a new branch in Bucharest,” stressing that Digitain’s presence in “a dynamic and growing market” such as Romania will ensure that the provider of gaming solutions and platform “better meet the needs” of its customers across European gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>As part of the firm’s ongoing expansion strategy, the new office is located in the heart of the city and is the first of several offices that Digitain is planning to open around the world in the near future. It will become the home of a team of experienced professionals who will work closely with Digitain’s European clients to enhance the company’s product quality and service.</p>
<p>“At Digitain, we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our clients,” Vardanyan continued, stressing the company’s belief that the opening of the office will bring the business a step closer to achieving its goals, including helping it foster strong relationships with European clients and partners.</p>
<p>“We are always looking for opportunities to grow and improve, and the opening of our new Bucharest office is a testament to this commitment,” Vardanyan concluded.</p>
<p>Working on All Fronts</p>
<p>Last year, Digitain entered into several business partnerships to expand its casino product offering and sportsbook footprint and made some internal shifts to its management team to prepare the business for scaling up.</p>
<p>In November, Digitain teamed with Spribe, a supplier of online casino gaming titles to add the supplier’s Turbo Games portfolio to its online casino platform and boost the product offering of its growing network of casino operators.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Digitain joined forces with the online casino brand Pin Up to power the brand’s sportsbook offering in Kazakhstan via its sportsbook platform and further deepen the partnership with the casino operator which began two years ago with a deal in Russia.</p>
<p>Another significant achievement of Digitain in 2022 was the signing of former Barcelona and Real Madrid soccer legend Luis Figo as its brand ambassador.</p>
