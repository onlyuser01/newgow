    <h1>Casinos Kansas City Casino Thunder Valley Casino Red Earth Casino Osage Casino Hotel Tulsa Flowing W</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My experiences from the beginning of June 2019 with Mr.Play:</p>
<p>I have made 200 euros as a deposit and could hardly defend my memory against the bonus, so I was also credited the bonus and I started with (my memory) 400 euros credit.</p>
<p>I was aware that I have to meet certain sales conditions in order to be able to withdraw a possible profit.</p>
<p>This is also "noticed" me in a previous use with another provider.</p>
<p>At that time I had won an amount X over the Live Casion (Roulette). After I was told that I still had to achieve the 35-fold deposit as sales on certain slot machines, I then did the same with the profit and I was paid a corresponding profit.</p>
<p>With Mr.Play I have made about 200 euros (plus 200 euros bonus) then about the live casino roulette around 10,000 euros profit. After verification, the amount was not paid because I had not yet met the bonus conditions.</p>
<p>In the live chat I was told that I have not yet implemented the 35-fold use. In order to fulfill these conditions, I even received a list from the live chat staff, with which game I get credited how much sales. Then, after informing and directing the live chat, I re-implemented the 200 Euro * 35 = 7,000 Euro in the recommended games. There was also a sales counter, which grew accordingly to 7,000 euros.</p>
<p>The then (still) existing assets in the amount of 7,000 euros, I then want to get paid.</p>
<p>After checking, however, the amount was withheld and only paid my deposit of 200 â‚¬, because I should have violated the bonus conditions.</p>
<p>Do you see the casino or me right?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Uwe</p>
