<p>The up-and-coming provider of iGaming content, Boldplay, announced a new partnership agreement, allowing it to further expand the reach of its thrilling games. Details regarding the latest deal emerged Thursday and see the iGaming content provider join forces with Favbet, a leading Ukrainian betting operator.</p>
<p>The freshly signed content agreement will see Boldplay provide its complete suite of engaging and thrilling games, powering Favbet’s operations. Thanks to the new partnership, customers of the operator will gain access to a portfolio of games, including popular table, slots, keno and bingo releases.</p>
<p>Additionally, the collaboration encompasses Boldplay’s virtual scratch cards. Overall, Favbet’s players are going to gain access to more than 100 thrilling and engaging games, offering unrivaled entertainment and unique features.</p>
<p>Valli Fragoso, Boldplay’s CEO, was excited about the latest collaboration with Favbet. She explained that the company is thrilled to strengthen Favbet’s offering and deliver its engaging products. Finally, Fragoso pointed out: “By working together, we’ll be able to provide Favbet customers with more quality gaming options while also strengthening the Boldplay brand in Europe.”</p>
<p>“Boldplay is delighted to be teaming up with Favbet Casino for what promises to be an exciting and highly successful partnership for everyone involved.“ Valli Fragoso, CEO at Boldplay</p>
<p>The deal with Boldplay comes on the heels of another important collaboration announced by Favbet recently. Last month, the leading casino and betting operator revealed it joined forces with BETER Live, the live casino division of the leading data and betting content provider, BETER. Under the terms of that deal, Favbet gained access to the provider’s range of interactive live casino games.</p>
<p>Boldplay Continues to Expand the Reach of Its Games</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Favbet’s customers are going to enjoy the thrilling features and mechanics offered by Boldplay. Per the new content agreement, players of the operator will tap into the Speed Heist slot, a recent release from Boldplay, along with other fan-favorite titles that offer the popular Cakeshop Cascade feature and mouth-watering prizes.</p>
<p>The deal with Favbet is also expected to bring benefits for Boldplay too. Thanks to the collaboration, the company continues to grow the reach of its games. Earlier this year, Boldplay announced another partnership that grew its global footprint further. At the time, the company announced it joined Pariplay’s Fusion platform. This enabled its entire portfolio of games to reach new operators across the globe.</p>
