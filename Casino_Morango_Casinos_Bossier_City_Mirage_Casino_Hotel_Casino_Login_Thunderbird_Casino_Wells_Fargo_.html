    <h1>Casino Morango Casinos Bossier City Mirage Casino Hotel Casino Login Thunderbird Casino Wells Fargo</h1>

<p>Two new sports lounges unveiled at the Wells Fargo Center.</p>
<p>Both are part of the arena’s partnership with SugarHouse Casino.</p>
<p>Guests can now watch sports while placing bets inside the lounges.</p>
<p>On October 9, two new SugarHouse Casino sports lounges were unveiled at Philadelphia’s Well Fargo Center. The launch of the new high-tech lounges was part of the celebrations of the Philadelphia Flyers home opener against the New Jersey Devils as well as the upcoming Sixers home opener against the Boston Celtics. Sports fans in the state can now watch the games below while simultaneously being able to enjoy a ton of games on the screens.</p>
<p>The two new sports lounges are going to be a vital component of Wells Fargo Center’s “Transformation 2020”. These lounges are collaborations between the arena, BetRivers.com and SugarHouse Casino which will be soon be rebranding as Rivers Casino Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“Both spaces are stunning additions to what has already been the most transformative phase of our renovation project and we know our fans will be delighted with the design and experience,” Valerie Camillo, President of Business Operations for the Flyers and Wells Fargo Center commented.</p>
<p>It is not all hype. The lounges are already receiving a considerable amount of praise for “elevating the game day experience” at the center. Philadelphia sports fans are among the most passionate and enthusiastic sports fans in the United States and the two facilities were built with that in mind. The guest will have basically everything they need to get into some betting action while watching their favorite games.</p>
<p>More Info on Each Sports Lounge</p>
<p>Located on the Main Concourse level in the redesigned south end of the Wells Fargo Centre, this sports lounge occupies 5,680 of space. That space features a total of ten 86-inch high-definition screens, a bar with an additional sixteen 65-inch monitors, odds boards and well-spaced seating areas.</p>
<p>The BetRivers.com Sports Lounge, on the other hand, is found on the New City Terrace and faces Wells Fargo Center’s bowl. As such, guests will be able to watch live sporting action while enjoying the games displayed on a humongous 22-feet by 8-feet LED screen. The 6,500-square-foot sports lounge also features several 50-inch, 65-inch and 85-inch screens that will be displaying even more games for the guests.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, both sports lounges are a reflection of the SugarHouse Casino’s upcoming rebrand as Rivers Casino. When the rebrand finally happens its PlaySugarHouse.com gaming platform will change to BetRivers.com. This will apply to its operation in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that transition is going to be even smoother since it also happens to include a marketing partnership with the arena. The gambling venue will now have advertising rights via mainstream audio-visual media, social media as well as inside the center’s bowl and throughout the concourse.</p>
