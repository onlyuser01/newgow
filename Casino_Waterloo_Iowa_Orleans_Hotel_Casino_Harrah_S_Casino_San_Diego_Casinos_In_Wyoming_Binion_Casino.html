    <h1>Casino Waterloo Iowa Orleans Hotel Casino Harrah S Casino San Diego Casinos In Wyoming Binion Casino</h1>

<p>Happy thanksgiving. It is almost too coincidental my significant other was banned from the wind creek casino Bethlehem on thanksgiving night considering our many unwelcoming encounters with valet and security over the past few months. Me my husband and our certified service dog arrived this evening in a McLaren 570s. Repeat McLaren not the mcmayflower. We frequent the casino and always come in peace and with enough cash to stuff at least two or three cornicopias. However it seems as though as there are two many chiefs running this unorganized, and often very discriminatory tribe of valet and security douchebags. One week we can park our car in valet then the next week we cannot. And we haven’t even touched land on the other subjects which warrant a significant lawsuit against wind creek and or its individual employees.</p>
<p>My husband and I are also landowners and we keep returning to the idiocy of who is your first contact as a guest.</p>
<p>Personally if we owned this casino and one of my valet minions or hired mall cops told a customer, who, mind you, spends a significant amount of money at my establishment and is also well known in the local successful small business owner community, that he was not allowed to park his McLaren or Maserati in valet, I would fire that person and anyone else who continued to harass a valuable customer. I’d actually fire that moron for not doing the math. Pop quiz: a Valet employee parks a 2002 doge neon and then also parks a lambo in the valet designated parking…statistically who is more likely to spend in the casino and or tip the valet employees or any other service member of staff?</p>
<p>Also if there isn’t any nice cars outside of your casino then is anyone winning? Honestly it’s embarrassing to the owners of wind creek, when it was owned by the sands the valet was packed with luxury cars and everyone had a WINNING vibe and attitude.</p>
<p>The last incident is only one of the many really troubling encounters we had at this casino. My husband was told this evening to never return to the casino, however a few of the employees who witnessed the harassment and mistreatment over the past few months encouraged us to lodge a complaint. We also were referred to a gentleman named glen gametz who is head of something at the casino in Bethlehem pa. The only encounters we have had were with Riley at valet, mason in security, Joanne security and Jessica in the spa. Oh and some bow tied mask wearing teenager who called himself "supervisor". But seriously if you decide to investigate ask Riley if we are aloud to park our McLaren in valet, ask mason why it took him 45 minutes to get up to the presidential suite but he only gave us 15 minutes to come down, and ask Joanne why the fuck a cute 5 foot 2 pretty girl like her is tossed in front of the war with a bunch of weak men crossing their arms behind her with there stupid mall cop badges proudly poppin plastic bling. Lastly ask Jessica about the rumor in the spa; HUGE privacy violation. Sounds like a repeat of 2021 lawsuits the employees won.</p>
<p>my partner and I enjoy playing at the casino and honestly we have been rolling off the ignorant and discriminatory treatment until now.</p>
<p>anyway again we are just trying to settle.</p>
<p>kinda like the pilgrims and Indians did on thanskgiving.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mrs.N***</p>
