<p>Information about Kahnawake casinos</p>
<p>The Kahnawake Gaming Commission (KGC) is one of the oldest gambling jurisdictions in the world, set up by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake in 1999.</p>
<p>Kahnawake is a self-governing state located in Canada. Having never been defeated in battle or in the Superior Court of Quebec, it retains the right to govern its own laws, including gambling regulation.</p>
<p>Many gaming operators have chosen to acquire a Kahnawake license to validate their products and services, and it's a respected authority in today's online gambling world.</p>
<p>This page will show you Kahnawake online casinos available to you and information on how you can find the best one. You can also read more about the history of Kahnawake, the pros and cons of having the license, and how to find Kahnawake casino bonuses.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>A brief history of the Kahnawake license</p>
<p>The Kahnawake license dates back to a time when online gambling was little more than just an idea. In 1996, there were very few interactive casinos to speak of, and the practice of betting on the internet certainly wasn't widespread.</p>
<p>The Mohawk Council within the state, though, had the foresight to set up a special gaming commission to govern the forthcoming wave of internet betting.</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1999, it released its first set of regulations which ensured that all interactive gaming entities followed certain safety principles, including:</p>
<p>Ensuring fair, safe, and honest gaming at all times</p>
<p>Keeping gaming away from criminal activity</p>
<p>Paying winners promptly and fairly</p>
<p>Preventing minors and other vulnerable people from playing.</p>
<p>The Canadian legal system has never sought to challenge the legality of the Kahnawake Gaming law, recognizing it as a valid entity by default. In fact, when an unsuccessful license applicant sued the KGC in 2007, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in the KGC's favor.</p>
<p>The commission faced probably its biggest-ever issue in 2009 when it dealt with the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal. Quickly explained, the commission found multiple instances of illicit play on the Ultimate Bet poker site and fined owners Tokwiro Enterprises a total of $23.5 million dollars. Almost all of this went back to players who were cheated out of their money.</p>
<p>Today, the Kahnawake license is still a recognized certificate for online casinos to have, which is why you may come across sites that display its badge on their homepage. The license indicates a commitment to safety and fairness, and players can register a complaint about a member casino via its website.</p>
<p>Pros and cons of the Kahnawake license</p>
<p>Like every casino license, Kahnawake has its good and bad points to consider.</p>
<p>While it's better for a casino to have the Kahnawake license than no license at all, it's important to be aware of the license's pros and cons.</p>
<p>The commission has a lot of experience</p>
<p>The KGC knows a thing or two about the online gambling industry, having been around since the mid-1990s. It's likely that they'll have dealt with all kinds of problems, which stands them in good stead when it comes to player complaints.</p>

<p>While the KGC has a pretty tight application process where operators must pay a significant fee to be a member, it still falls short of the strict rules imposed by the likes of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the Gambling Commission (GC) . Although only a slight risk, it may mean that a member casino is less responsible than those with licenses from other authorities.</p>

<p>While it's great that the KGC has been around since the 90s, it doesn't really look like its website has been updated since then. This may be frustrating when it comes to making a complaint, which you can only do by sending them an email.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Kahnawake casino for you</p>
<p>An online casino with a Kahnawake license is better than one with no license at all â€“ but that doesn't mean it's the best option for you!</p>
<p>The Casino Guru team specializes in finding reliable casinos to play on. To do this, we subject each site to a strict set of objective criteria and award it a Safety Index depending on what we find.</p>
<p>The Safety Index considers casino revenue, the fairness of its terms and conditions, its size-to-complaints ratio (bigger casinos tend to get more), and several more factors to provide the most accurate rating possible.</p>
<p>The best of these casinos will appear when you select the 'Recommended' tab on this page. These have the highest Safety Index thanks to their excellent performance and come with Casino Guru's blessing.</p>
<p>You'll also see a 'Newly opened' tab. No prizes for guessing that this will show you the new Kahnawake casinos out there. These sites may not be well established, but might have some generous welcoming offers for new players.</p>
