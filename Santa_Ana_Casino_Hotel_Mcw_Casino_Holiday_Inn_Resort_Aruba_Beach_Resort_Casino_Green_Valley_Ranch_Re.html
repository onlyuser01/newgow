    <h1>Santa Ana Casino Hotel Mcw Casino Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Resort Casino Green Valley Ranch Re</h1>

<p>Betus closed my account and is trying hard to keep my money</p>
<p>Betus closed my account about 3 months ago and told me to call them by phone. They would not tell me why my account was closed over email and insisted i call them on the phone... I called them by phone and they started making up lies telling me ive been "sharing information" (whatever that means) with another player .</p>
<p>When asking them how they came up with such an accusation, all i got for a response was "you know what you did just admit it" . At betus its obvious that you are guilty until proven innocent instead of the other way around. Just baseless claim after baseless claim on the phone call, i simply could not believe what i was hearing. I even sent them a photo of my id and a selfie holding my id ! But apparently this is not enough verification for them.... would also be willing to send in bank statements aswell and even write my id of the account on a piece of paper and send them a selfie with it, but this would also not be "sufficient verification" for them because it seems they will do absolutely anything they can in their power to not pay me out and steal my money with baseless claims. This account is the only account i have ever had with betus. The other player they mentioned (or made up) has obviously has no ties whatsover to my "ip address" as they claim because have no idea who this person is (if he even exists) . They have pointed me to their terms and conditions which absolutely have nothing to do with me as i have abided by all the guidelines and terms and they have no reply when i ask them for evidence or proof (obviously because its fabricated) for all their baseless claims and give me replies like "you know what you did, just admit it", "if you want your account reopened you need to come clean with me and tell me your relationship with <em>insertname</em>, "im trying to understand what your relationship is with <em>insert name</em> . "we cant open your account if you dont tell me what your relationship is with <em>insert name</em> " . Keep in mind i have no idea who this person is that they are mentioning and he is probably made up . And when i mention that i dont know the person they are talking about they just tell me they cant reopen my account until i admit i know the person .....ridiculous and obvious tactics of trying to scam me and keep my money.</p>
<p>My account has been closed for a few months now without any progress towards it being reopened.</p>
<p>My account id is : 2043191</p>
