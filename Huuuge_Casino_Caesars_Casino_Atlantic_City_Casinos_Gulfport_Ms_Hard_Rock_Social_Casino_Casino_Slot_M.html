<p>Globally-recognized iGaming technology company Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) announced that its award-winning platform now powers the famous Rizk casino brand which is live within the regulated gambling market in Germany. The announcement came Thursday, and it follows approval for the suitability of GiG's platform in the country.</p>
<p>It was back in April 2020, when Betsson acquired GiG's business-to-customer assets, including Zecure and the brand Rizk. Now, thanks to GiG's award-winning platform, Betsson will further strengthen its presence in the regulated gambling market in Germany with Rizk Casino. Per the terms of the new collaboration, the brand will benefit from GiG's extensive knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there have been multiple changes to the gambling regulation in the country. Major changes to the iGaming market occurred with the Fourth State Treaty on Gambling, which was implemented in July 2021. Then, at the start of this year, a new federal regulator known as Gemeinsamen Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL) was appointed.</p>
<p>Its responsibilities include monitoring the gambling market, licensing, as well as ensuring that licensees adhere to the established regulations. Despite the strict rules for the online gambling market, under GGL's guidance, Germany is expected to become one of the most important markets on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Andrew Valenzia, Betsson's Commercial Director, shared his excitement about the support the Rizk casino brand will receive from GiG. In a statement, he said: "This is a fantastic milestone for Betsson Group having such a legendary brand in RIZK return to the market."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the company strives to offer engaging and safe entertainment. Finally, Valenzia pointed out: "The expansion into Germany reaffirms our fantastic partnership with GiG, who continue to provide us with an excellent service that goes beyond our expectations."</p>
<p>Betsson's deal with GiG isn't surprising, considering the provider's strong presence in different regulated gambling markets around the world. Currently, GiG's solutions meet compliance requirements in 29 different gambling markets, while the company plans to expand this by another eight soon.</p>
<p>Marcel Elfersy, GiG's Chief Commercial Officer, was similarly delighted about the deal with Betsson in Germany. "Our excellent relationship with Betsson and the continuing expansion of our original deal, highlights the strength of our Platform, technology and managed services teams," he said.</p>
<p>Elfersy added: "We've positioned ourselves to be able to support our partners growth aspirations, understanding where those opportunities are and ensuring we not only meet those expectations, but exceed them." In conclusion, GiG's Chief Commercial Officer explained that the collaboration with Betsson further strengthen the company's presence within the business-to-business vertical.</p>
