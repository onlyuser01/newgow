    <h1>Casino En Linea Lakeside Casino Osceola Iowa Hard Rock Casino Vegas Casinos And Slots Turning Stone</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder has achieved another major milestone with the company’s Playzido solution, a dynamic content creation platform, that is now officially available in Michigan and follows up on a license awarded by the regulatory body in the state in 2022.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Light &amp; Wonder will be able to provide partner operators with its award-winning solution that brings numerous content options that are part of the company’s Remote Gaming Server (RGS) platform and facilitate player access to excellent titles across the board.</p>
<p>Thanks to Playzido, partner operators can access content from studios that have been previously not available in the United States, and the platform itself is a flexible solution that allows casinos to integrate games effortlessly.</p>
<p>The platform similarly assists up-and-coming studios that are operating in a contested market to bring their products to market quickly and efficiently. Light &amp; Wonder has hailed this milestone and said that Playzido’s Michigan entry would bring many benefits to innovative studios that are looking to introduce their games.</p>
<p>Among the noteworthy titles that will be coming through Playzido and benefit from the powerful RGS platform are such options as Charlie’s Angels, Diamond Multiplier Respins, and Blazing 777 2x3x5x.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder iGaming Head of US Commercial Dana Jackel has welcomed the opportunity to see Playzido launch in yet another state and bring an important change to the local market, including giving players the opportunity to experience fresh content.</p>
<p>According to Jackel, Playzido has already demonstrated its success in Europe and Light &amp; Wonder is thrilled to be introducing this solution to the market in Michigan. "Everyone at Light &amp; Wonder is ecstatic to harness the Playzido technology to bring next-level studios and games to our operator partners and players in Michigan to enjoy," Jackel added.</p>
<p>Apart from building up its Playzido offer, Light &amp; Wonder has also put an emphasis on its OpenGaming solution, adding a number of innovative and worthwhile studios, including DreamSpin and Bang Bang Games.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has also been working with some of the biggest names in the gambling industry, recently scaling up its alliance with Betsson Group.</p>
