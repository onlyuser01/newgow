    <h1>San Tan Casino Casino In Erie Black And Mild Casino Online Casino Paypal Casino Nashua Nh Jungliwin</h1>

<p>Okay, I'll try to explain the whole thing again.</p>
<p>I contacted the casino via the support email on May 30, 2023, reported my gambling addiction, said that I was afraid of gambling the money away again and asked the casino whether they could close my account due to gambling addiction and whether then My payout is still processed normally.</p>
<p>I did not receive a response to this email, but was assigned a VIP manager a day later on May 31, 2023. So I wrote to the VIP manager and asked again about restrictions on my account. I assumed that the VIP Manager was the answer to my email, along the lines of providing me with someone who could help me with this problem.</p>
<p>After he told me that I couldn't set any limits in my account, I also asked the VP Manager to block my account. He just told me that it was not possible to close the account with a balance.</p>
<p>So, I contacted Live Chat again, who told me to contact VIP Manager. But I've already done that, several times.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have been waiting the whole time for a response to my email of May 30, 2023, in which I clearly and explicitly stated gambling addiction.</p>
<p>As I said, I assumed that the VIP manager was supposed to help me with this.</p>
<p>They say that I should contact the VIP management of my gambling addiction directly. At the time of my email, on May 30, 2023, I didn't have a VIP manager yet. So I reported my gaming addiction to the support email.</p>
<p>I have also often asked the VIP manager how exactly I can restrict my account, that I am afraid of losing my money and whether he can help me with this. At this point it was actually clear to me that the VIP manager was supposed to help. So I asked him if my withdrawals could be accelerated so I could finally close my account. Of course, I had full access to my account during this time and also gambled away all the money, whereupon I was offered bonuses.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that on May 30, 2013 I legally requested an account blocking due to gambling addiction, which was never processed. Assigning a VIP manager didn't help either, as they didn't help me with this either. I did everything in my power to alert the casino to my gambling addiction.</p>
<p>I have also read the terms and conditions and behaved correctly and applied for a legally binding account blocking. However, this was not carried out.</p>
<p>As a result, I was able to gamble away all my money again. In my opinion, I should be reimbursed for losses from May 30th until my account is finally closed, minus withdrawals in relation to deposits.</p>
<p>As I said, I requested an account blocking, this was not carried out and the VIP Manager did not help me either.</p>
<p>What else was I supposed to do?</p>
