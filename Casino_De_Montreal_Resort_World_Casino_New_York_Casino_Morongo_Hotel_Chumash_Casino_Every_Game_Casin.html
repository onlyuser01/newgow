<p>Gambling in Kenya could be restricted to night-time hours if a bill is passed in the country.</p>
<p>The Nairobi county assembly is considering whether to pass the Nairobi City County Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Amendment Bill 2021, which would ban all forms of betting and gambling between the hours of 5am and 8pm. The bill is seeking to protect working hours with deputy majority whip Waithera Chege believing that banning gambling during normal working hours will achieve this.</p>
<p>She said: "I have observed the operations of betting and gaming establishments in the county for a while now and I believe something must be done to curtail the hours spent in these establishments by our youth if we are to secure our future as a county."</p>
<p>"I shall be proposing that the county and national licensing board limit the operating hours of these establishments from 8pm to 5am so as to help keep productive hours among the citizenry and avoid wastage of time by some youths who are, sadly, now addicted to gambling and spend a lot of time in these establishments."</p>
<p>"I believe something must be done to curtail the hours spent in these establishments by our youth if we are to secure our future as a county."</p>
<p>The proposal, which is focusing on protecting the youth from gambling, would’ve taken into considering the following research. Data from a 2017 survey conducted by Geopoll suggested that Kenya has the highest rate of youths who participate in gambling in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated 76% of young Kenyans have engaged in at least one form of gambling.</p>
<p>Millennials from Kenya spend an average of $50 per month on betting according to the same survey, which are mainly placed on football.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, those in Kenya’s capital would only be able to gamble between the hours of 8pm and 5am.</p>
