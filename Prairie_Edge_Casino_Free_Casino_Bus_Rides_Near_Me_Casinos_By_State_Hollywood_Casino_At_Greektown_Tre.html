This number represents a 10% year-on-year increase and continues the industry’s growth.</p>

Overall, the commercial sports betting industry has so far had gross gaming revenue of $3.97 billion, which is 69.6% more than what the industry earned in the January-August period last year. Analysts believe that the industry may top a handle $100 billion by the end of the year, driven by the popularity of the National Football League and other famous sports.</p>
<p>Lastly, the iGaming industry recorded a GGR of $401.8 million for the period, representing an increase of 31.9%. iGaming has so far recorded a GGR of $3.21 billion, 39.9% up on 2021, making it one of the fastest-growing verticals.</p>

In addition, four states recorded lower year-on-year revenue paces, namely Columbia, Kansas, Mississippi and South Dakota.</p>
