<p>Kalamba Games has been able to enter the Ontario iGaming market through a partnership with Bragg Gaming Group, significantly expanding its presence in important jurisdictions in North America. Thanks to this tie-up, Kalamba is able to deliver a number of award-winning and high-performing games to Canadian customers.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Takes on Ontario’s iGaming Market</p>
<p>The content will be distributed locally through Bragg’s Remote Games Server (RGS) through ORYX Gaming and Spin Games. Bragg has already been present on the market for several months, providing local operators with third-party games in the province. Bragg obtained its license in April when Ontario launched regulated iGaming officially.</p>
<p>Kalamba is appreciative of the opportunity to be present in the Ontario market as it allows the company to quickly expand its reach and deliver its products to established operators, and through there – to players interested in exploring Kalamba’s original content.</p>
<p>Kalamba is confident that its product offering is becoming one of the best solutions on the market, with the company gaining a significant foothold across key regions. The latest partnership with Bragg Gaming in Ontario is just a continuation of this strategy.</p>
<p>Kalamba also leverages powerful technological solutions such as BullsEye, a dedicated in-house RGS, and Stargazer, an analytics platform. Both are designed to ensure that players get the best possible experience and that operators are able to leverage the content in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Both Bragg and Kalamba Are Happy with Breakthrough</p>
<p>Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby was pleased with this launch and thanked Bragg Gaming Group for the collaboration. He spoke about the opportunities that awaited both companies and what all of this meant for Kalamba:</p>
<p>Its established position within the Ontario market will see us deliver our titles to a number of operators in this newly regulated region for the first time and we’re eager to see player’s reception to our games. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby</p>
<p>Bragg group director of content Doug Fallon confirmed that the company is looking to secure the best possible content from leading partner studios. Kalamba Games fits perfectly in this strategic narrative. The company has already developed a fantastic reputation for innovation-drive and dynamic titles in North America, Fallon added. Previously, Bragg and Kalamba Games collaborated for the US market.</p>
