<p>Las Vegas Sport Bettor and Jeopardy! Phenom James Holzhauer Makes It 24 in a Row</p>

<p>That’s the second largest winning streak ever in the show’s 55-year history — and by a long chalk. Holzhauer has surpassed the previously second-placed guy — computer scientist Roger Craig, who won $530,200 in 2015 — more than three times over.</p>
<p>Along the way he has broken various notable Jeopardy! records, armed only with a super-fast buzzer finger, a brain stuffed with facts, and an unconventional gambler’s strategy.</p>
<p>On April 9, the 34-year-old from Las Vegas set the single-game record when he won $131,127, beating his own record set a week previously. Holzhauer’s average daily winnings of $77,798 now surpass the previous single-game high of $77,000.</p>
<p>They’re so proud of him in Las Vegas that the Clark County Commission has presented him with the key to the Las Vegas Strip and named him a “goodwill ambassador” for the city.</p>
<p>That was three weeks ago, and he’s still going — and he looks like he may smash the $2 million barrier before the end of this week.</p>
<p>Holzhauer’s Secret</p>
<p>But he still has some way to go to catch all-time Jeopardy! megalord Ken Jennings, who won an incredible 74 games in a row back in 2004 for a total haul of $2,520,7000.</p>
<p>While Holzhauer still has over 50 games to go before overtaking Jennings, on current form he could surpass him on monetary terms within ten more wins.</p>
<p>In an interview with The New York Times last month, Holzhauer described how his career as a gambler had shaped his Jeopardy! strategy, which involves going for the highest-value clues first in the hope of hitting a Daily Double.</p>
<p>“You could make an analogy to sports betting or poker tournaments,” he said. “There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t.</p>
<p>“When I was just getting started in sports, I didn’t have a huge bankroll, and there were times when I would see a good betting opportunity and didn’t have enough to put down on it,” he added. “Hitting a Daily Double on the first clue is nice I guess, but you can do a lot more damage if you have $5,000 in front of you already.”</p>
<p>Jacob’s Ladder</p>
<p>Holzhauer is not the first professional gambler to make a splash on the show. In 2016, former United States Poker Champion Alex Jacob was crowned Jeopardy! Champion of Champions, winning the final after enjoying a six-game streak.</p>
<p>Jacobs picked up around $250,000 in total by employing a strategy known as the “Forrest Bounce,” developed decades ago by former champion Chuck Forrest.</p>
<p>The technique involves “bouncing” around from topic to topic rather than sticking with the ones you know, and again selecting high value clues wherever possible.</p>
