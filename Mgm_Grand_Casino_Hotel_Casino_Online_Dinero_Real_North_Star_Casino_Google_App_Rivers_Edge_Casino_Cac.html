<p>One of the biggest industry events for B2B companies in the gaming sector, ICE London, is just around the corner. Scheduled to take place between February 7 and 9 at ExCel London, the convention will once again bring the industry together. With the event starting tomorrow, Clarion Gaming unveiled who the recipients of the ICE Landmark Awards will be:</p>
<p>People</p>
<p>Ernie Stevens Jr</p>
<p>Roy Student</p>
<p>David Snook</p>
<p>Per Jaldung</p>
<p>Jimmy Thomas</p>
<p>Organizations</p>
<p>Les Ambassadeurs</p>
<p>Betson Group</p>
<p>TCS John Huxley</p>
<p>Continent 8</p>
<p>Nanocosmos</p>
<p>The Landmarks will be presented in the ICE Lounge on February 8, between 16:00 and 17:00.</p>
<p>About the Recipients</p>
<p>Stevens is the chairman and national spokesperson for the Indian Gaming Association, an inter-tribal association that seeks to protect tribal sovereignty and self-sufficiency. Under his leadership, Tribal Gaming was preserved throughout the pandemic, which is why he is seen as one of the biggest contributors in the industry.</p>
<p>Roy Student, meanwhile, was recognized for his long career in US gaming, during which he founded Gaming Systems International and Cyberview Technology.</p>
<p>David Snook, on the other hand, is a seasoned industry journalist from Europe who was the first to report on the exhibition back in 1968 when it was still known as ATEI.</p>
<p>Jaldung is another European recipient who was awarded for his exceptional service as chairman of the European Casino Association.</p>
<p>The last award will go to Jimmy Thomas, who sadly passed away this year. Thomas played a huge role in shaping the contemporary UK gambling industry and was an avid pioneer, innovator and philanthropist. The award will be accepted by his son, Simon Thomas, currently executive chair of The Hippodrome Casino.</p>
<p>In addition to the five contributors, five commercial organizations will also receive Landmarks. These include Betrson Group, TCS John Huxley, Continent 8 and Nanocosmos, which are celebrating their 60th, 50th, 25th and 25th birthday respectively. Les Ambassadeurs will also receive a Landmark for its impressive breakthroughs in corporate philanthropy and community engagement.</p>
<p>MD Hunter Released a Statement</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, managing director of Clarion Gaming which organizes ICE London, commented on the Landmarks. He said that these serve as recognition of the efforts of exceptional individuals and companies.</p>
<p>Many of the progressive initiatives, game-changing products and influential personalities that have shaped the industry have had strong connections with ICE and its predecessor ATEI and I am delighted that the show continues to play such an important role helping to create opportunity and prosperity for the global business. Stuart Hunter, MD, Clarion Gaming</p>
<p>Hunter noted that the recipients of the Awards have all been nominated from within the industry. He concluded that he is honored to welcome them at ICE London.</p>
