<p>Multiple charities in the UK will benefit from donations made by leading sportsbooks, members of the BGC, that decided to donate profits from the upcoming race</p>
<p>Some of the UK’s top charities will benefit this year from a donation that will be made by members of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC). The council confirmed Thursday that leading bookmakers in the country vowed to donate all profits from the upcoming handicap Britannia Stakes Race at this year’s Royal Ascot.</p>
<p>Members of BGC that will contribute to the noble cause include bet365, Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral), 888 William Hill, Betway, Kindred (Unibet), Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, Sky Bet), Rank Group (Grosvenor Sport), Tote, Fitzdares and Bet as well as Virgin Bet and LivescoreBet.</p>
<p>All of those leading companies agreed to back the fundraising initiative and donate their profits. Britannia Stakes is a landmark race that will take place on June 22, 2023, at Royal Ascot. The profits of the bookmakers from the race will bring valuable funds for different charities such as SAS Regimental Association (SASRA), Together for Looked After Children, Ascot Racecourse Supports, Cystic Fibrosis Trust and the Holocaust Educational Trust.</p>
<p>Since 2019, when the BGC was created, it has helped raise more than £5.5 million ($6.8 million) for good causes, helping different charities. When it comes to the iconic big-field heritage handicap, BGC members helped raise some £1.2 million ($1.5 million) last year. It is unclear whether or not the donations from this year’s race will surpass the one from 2022. Yet, the BGC said that even if bookmakers don’t make a profit this year, they will make a combined donation of £250,000 ($309,300) which will benefit nominated charities.</p>
<p>Donations Continue to Help Charities</p>
<p>Alastair Warwick, Ascot Racecourse’s chief executive, explained that it is great to see leading bookmakers in the country once again contribute with donations to charities from the Britannia Stakes. Finally, Warwick noted: “The money raised since 2020 has been extremely well received, including by our own Ascot Racecourse Supports program and the contributions have enabled us to support some extremely worthy causes and carry out important work in the community.”</p>
<p>“I am once again delighted that the BGC’s largest members are helping celebrate the King’s Coronation by raising vital funds at the Royal Meeting for some of the country’s top charities.“ Michael Dugher, chief executive of the BGC</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, BGC’s chief executive, was similarly excited and said that it is great to see the raising of funds for charities in celebration of the coronation of the King. He acknowledged that those funds bring valuable support to charities in the UK. Finally, Dugher thanked everyone for their support and dedication to helping charities.</p>
