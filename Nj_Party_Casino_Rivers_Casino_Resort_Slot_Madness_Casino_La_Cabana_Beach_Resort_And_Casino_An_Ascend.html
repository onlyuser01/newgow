    <h1>Nj Party Casino Rivers Casino Resort Slot Madness Casino La Cabana Beach Resort And Casino An Ascend</h1>

<p>Had to upload 100 documents, but something always didn't fit. They are always looking for reasons to refuse my payout. Now they want to know why my girlfriend gave me money and they want a handwritten letter from my girlfriend explaining why. They now have bank statements from the last 6 months, payslips from the last 6 months, Skrill transfers from the last 6 months, Paysafecard transactions from the last 6 months, ID, income tax return 2022, my girlfriend's handwritten letter, my girlfriend's ID. Every day they reject the payment again and look for something new. Hands off, keep trying the payout now.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, only the following documents were requested:</p>

<p>When I did all this, the payout was denied because they want the February 2023 payslip. (Already on February 28). I said I don't have it because I haven't gotten my salary yet to get the statement in the mail. Then it all went back and forth and they still refused the payout. When I received the payslip in the mail, I uploaded it straight away. The answer was: All required documents have now been uploaded. We will forward the documents and process the withdrawal. I ask a day later. Suddenly they wanted to know why my girlfriend gave me money? I then told them how and why. Then the payment was rejected again and they wanted a letter with the reason and yellow amount that my girlfriend gave me + period + ID card + my girlfriend's signature. When I did all that, the withdrawal was again declined and told it must be handwritten. When I wrote it by hand and my girlfriend signed it, it was rejected again. Rationale: She must write the text from the first-person perspective. Now she wrote it again, held it next to her face and on the other side of her face her ID card. I'm curious what's coming tomorrow, maybe N1Casino doesn't fit your handwriting or the color of the pen wasn't right. I'll keep you up to date :)... It's certainly also against data protection... Evidence or screens from all the correspondence (where you can see that they are constantly coming up with new requirements) are of course available. You send everything by email.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tobias</p>
