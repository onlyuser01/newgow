<p>Yabby must go they are cheats they robbed me on slots 15 times straight as soon as I figured out what they were doing they would jump to something else I have at least 50 ways they are cheating people stay away from this place worst casino I have ever dealt with In 40 years plus I self excluded myself and test they continued to let let me play and lose over 2k they knock you out of the system but yet you can still keep playing but then your requirements don’t move I played for hours and hours and hours and I was never able to finish my requirement without going broke 97 bonus In one game and never won anything the list is so long I’m quitting online playing forever but I’m going to ask them at least for the money I lost after I asked to be excluded they gave me a 333% match promo 15 or 20 times in a row and I didn’t co e close to winning plus customer service was belittling me and rude I will donate any $$$ to charity but I’m am warning everyone be careful this is the worst I ever seen in my life I want to know where they are at and I’m ready hire a private investigator this is sickening me so blatant I have more hours of playing online slots in the past few years then anyone alive let’s put it that way I kept playing to prove a point are they cheating ? And I will say with certainty that yes they are and I’m willing to put my life on it so others don’t get cheated this story must be told at any cost please please listen to what I’m saying stay away this isn’t some system glitch like I was hoping it would be but there’s a place for scammers like these 😭😭🫣💵💵</p>
