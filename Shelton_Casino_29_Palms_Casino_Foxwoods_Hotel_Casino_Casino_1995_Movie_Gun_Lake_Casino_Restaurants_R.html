<p>Under the terms of a new deal, Stake will benefit from accessing RAS' complete racing platform, odds and content, strengthening its offering</p>
<p>The leading provider of fully integrated premium data, content and technology solutions, catering to the global betting and racing industries, Racing and Sports (RAS) Technology Holdings, announced a new groundbreaking partnership with Stake.com, one of the largest online casinos and sportsbooks across the globe. Details regarding the new two-year partnership emerged Monday.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new deal, which has an option for a one-year renewal, Stake will benefit RAS’ innovative horse racing solution. Gaining access to the company’s complete racing solution will strengthen the operator’s offering. The new partnership is expected to kick off once Stake rolls out its racing offering. This launch is expected at some point during the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Besides accessing the innovative horse racing solution from RAS, Stake will benefit from market-leading racing data. The betting and iGaming operator will also leverage a wide range of content that will be translated into different languages, making it suitable for a number of markets across the globe. According to a statement released by RAS, the “remuneration model for this collaboration is structured around a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated through Stake.com’s racing offer.”</p>
<p>The Partnership Brings Excitement for Stake, RAS</p>
<p>Jarrod Febbraio, Stake’s commercial director, revealed that the company is delighted to join forces with RAS and elevate its offering thanks to leading technology and odds. “We are eagerly awaiting to go live on the platform and offer additional options for our customers to explore,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Racing &amp; Sports and take our product to the next level with one of the leading racing odds and software providers in the industry.“ Jarrod Febbraio, commercial director at Stake</p>
<p>Back in December, Stake forged a partnership with TG Lab, a leading platform provider. Through the aforementioned agreement, Stake secured access to the regulated gambling market in Colombia.</p>
<p>Besides a sportsbook, Stake currently offers an online casino as well. Currently, the platform supports more than 25 currencies, including cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to embark on this exciting journey with Stake.com, the highest volume betting platform globally.“ Stephen Crispe, CEO at RAS</p>
<p>Stephen Crispe, RAS’ CEO, was also delighted about the freshly minted agreement with Stake, highlighting its strong position within the global iGaming vertical. According to him, the deal will help elevate Stake’s offering. Finally, Crispe predicted that the collaboration would strengthen the platform’s presence in the sector.</p>
