<p>Slots provider Endorphina has signed up a new partnership with Italian gaming operator Staryes. This will allow Endorphina to position its ample portfolio of games with audiences in Italy and reach new players through its authentic and innovative gaming products. Endorphina has developed a number of excellent games such as Crystal Skull, the Vampires II, Santa’s Gift, 100 Zombies Dice, and many others, with select titles making it to players moving forward.</p>
<p>Endorphina Expands Clout in Italian Market</p>
<p>Endorphina senior partnership manager Zdenek Llosa welcomed the opportunity to work with Staryes in Italy and pursue new opportunities in the market. This collaboration said Llosa would bring mutual benefits and long-term profits for both companies.</p>
<p>Endorphina has confirmed that Staryes will have access to the full selection of games that are currently approved to operate in Italy. Llosa added that Endorphina was highly appreciative of the operator’s experience in the market and explained that the company was confident about the long-term success of this partnership.</p>
<p>Staryes commercial director Andrea Ribotta was similarly excited about the partnership opportunity and said that Endorphina brings a great mix of titles that are now available to even more Italian players through Staryes’ dedicated platform. Games such as Ninja, Hit Slot 2022, and many more will be available to Italian customers now.</p>
<p>Endorphina products recently appeared on Livespins, an innovative platform where streamers and viewers can gamble at the same time, together. The studio’s partnership with Staryes is an important one as it reflects Endorphina’s overall desire to continue pursuing growth worldwide. In August, the company expanded its presence in the Latin American market with Latamwin.</p>
