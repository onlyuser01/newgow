<p>Besides the relaunch of the brand, JNS Gaming confirmed it anticipates LynxBet to grow significantly within strategic markets around the world</p>
<p>JNS Gaming, a unique iGaming start-up, confirmed Wednesday the re-launch of its revamped online casino and sports betting brand LynxBet. The re-launch was facilitated in collaboration with Delasport, a leading platform provider.</p>
<p>LynxBet’s re-launch seeks to help the brand tap into new jurisdictions and establish its presence within the continuously growing and competitive iGaming market by leveraging a localized approach that delivers engaging experiences for the customers.</p>
<p>Currently, LynxBet operates via a Tier 1 license from the Isle of Man. The recently revamped brand, similarly to Delasport, supports responsible gambling entertainment. The brand offers different responsible gambling options such as deposit, bet and loss limits, as well as self-exclusion and time-out options.</p>
<p>Besides responsible iGaming experiences, LynxBet leverages fun and entertaining solutions that help with player engagement and retention. Elevating the experience for the players and raising brand awareness, the online casino and sportsbook brand created Lucky Lynx, a unique mascot that is featured within its online platform.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased with going live with LynxBet.“ Oren Cohen Shwartz, CEO of Delasport</p>
<p>Delasport’s CEO, Oren Cohen Shwartz, revealed that the company is excited to go live with LynxBet. According to him, this collaboration will help solidify Delasport’s position as a leading provider of casino and sports betting solutions. Finally, Shwartz said: “I am sure that LynxBet players will be happy to engage with a modern, personalized and unique betting experience; and that our partnership will be fruitful.”</p>
<p>The Brand Plans to Expand in Different Jurisdictions</p>
<p>Jeremy Taylor, JNS Gaming’s CEO, explained that the re-launch of LynxBet comes after months of hard work. He explained that JNS Gaming is excited to see the brand relaunch and acknowledged the competitiveness of the iGaming vertical. Taylor said that LynxBet will deliver “an immersive platform that offers something alternative for players to explore.” He pointed out that Delasport’s strong technology and product helped supercharge the brand.</p>
<p>“Simply put, JNS Gaming is an iGaming start-up like no other. We are very ambitious and truly believe that our unique user journey will captivate players worldwide. Over the coming months, we will be revealing more developments that will illustrate our desire to propel LynxBet to new heights.“ Jeremy Taylor, CEO at JNS Gaming</p>
<p>According to JNS Gaming, a strategic goal for LynxBet will be to expand within multiple markets and establish a strong player base. Such markets can include jurisdictions such as Asia, Canada, as well as South America. To cater to customers within different markets, the brand will put emphasis on localized services such as live chat and email customer support in different languages. Additionally, JNS Gaming said it plans to establish localized teams that can further boost player engagement.</p>
