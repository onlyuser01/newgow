<p>The Cage review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Cage takes players into an unforgiving world of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>As onlookers cheer and rattle the ring of metal bars, players will begin the fight of their life. The other fighters’ faces are slick with sweat as players are pushed to their limits to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>This slot would suit fans of mixed martial arts, boxing, and wrestling.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a retro feel with fast-paced digital notes that add tension. The ding of a bell and moody vocalizations add to the chaotic cage match atmosphere.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see intimidating bars that confine them to an opponent. A shadowy crowd screams support among neon lights. The humidity of the crowded space is palpable and there are signs that this fight is less than official.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with an array of fighters with bare chests and raised fists. Each man is illustrated in a vivid style with dark outlines that bring to mind a classic comic book.</p>
<p>As different opponents face blows, the animators have not held back on the details of their bruises and spittle. There is a video game flavor to the nature of the combat, and fans of this type of game will feel right at home.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of The Cage create a dramatic, gritty world of cage fighting.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Cage has a 3-4-3-4-3-4-3 reel structure. In total, there are 5,184 ways to win.</p>
<p>During the Title Fight Free Spins feature the reel area transforms to 3-3-3-2-2-2-3-3-3, and wins pay both ways.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols will disappear, making way for new symbols to fall in from above.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Wild Knockout xBomb symbol also substitutes for all symbols with the exception of the Scatter symbol. These Knockout symbols have the special ability to make all symbols in a cross pattern next to themit explode. During this process, a win multiplier also increases.</p>
<p>The Roundhouse Kick feature is triggered when 2-6 matching symbols align diagonally, but no winning combination is created. The symbols that triggered the feature are taken away, and a Wild symbol is placed in the middle of the alignment. Depending on the number of triggering symbols, 1-4 Wild Knockout xBomb symbols are awarded.</p>
<p>The Title Fight Free Spins feature is triggered when players land 3 Scatters. The reels are transformed to a 3-3-3-2-2-2-3-3-3 structure and four title belt boosters are available to be activated throughout the feature as new belts are won.</p>
<p>The Title Free Spins feature consists of a series of 5 fights, in which players must land a number of blows on their opponent. A blow is achieved when players land an Uppercut symbol. As the levels progress, the opponents become more challenging to defeat.</p>
