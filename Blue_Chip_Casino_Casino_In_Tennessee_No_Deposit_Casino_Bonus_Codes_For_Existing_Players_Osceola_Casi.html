<p>Pragmatic Play, an acclaimed iGaming content developer, has expanded its presence in the Latin American market, where the company has been actively scaling up its momentum over the past months. The latest deal features a partnership with a prominent Brazilian operator, Vem Betar.</p>

<p>The company’s VP of Latin American Operations, Victor Arias, was very excited to see the supplier grow its local presence in the market over the past months, and now specifically with Vem Betar in Brazil. Speaking of growth, Pragmatic has been able to expand its reach in the region with deals with FullReto, Dinastia, and SAEsports, among others.</p>
<p>"Our LatAm presence is on an upwards trajectory and this partnership continues to strengthen our position in the region. We’re thrilled to be able to reach more players than before in one of our leading markets," Arias said confident of the future success of the company in the region.</p>
<p>Vem Betar was similarly excited about the opportunity and argued that Pragmatic Play was among the most impressive studios that the company has worked with.
