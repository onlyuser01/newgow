    <h1>Marksville Casino Mountain Gods Resort Casino Ruidoso Casinos Biloxi Mississippi Funrize Casino Wild</h1>

<p>After receiving a loyalty free play during my last spin on a 50 Cent BET in Cash Bandits 3, I hit a win of $523. The playthrough requirement was initially from the game Eternal Love, where I had only won around a dollar. So, my playthrough was only $120 or $130. To be able to cash out the maximum of $50, I increased my BET to $6.25, but it wasn't decreasing fast enough, so I raised it to $12. I wanted to be cautious, as some casinos require you to cash out with your initial bonus winnings. So, I stopped at $60, knowing I would only get $50 either way. I requested a cashout and received an email from the manager, Allie, stating that I violated their policy and rules, and my withdrawal was denied. They claimed it was because I bet over $10.</p>
<p>I tried to reason with Allie, showing documentation of my $523 jackpot win from a 50 Cent bet, but she insisted on my violation due to the $12 bets. I pointed out that their terms and conditions were vague and that they added another $10 chip to my account, which contradicted their own rules. She refused all my options and was willing to lose me as a customer over this issue. It's frustrating because my $12 bet didn't affect the outcome, and it was already after I had completed my guaranteed playthrough. Their casino rules regarding betting over $10 are unclear, and it doesn't make sense to allow bets above that limit if it's against their rules. I'm considering escalating this issue to higher authorities.</p>
