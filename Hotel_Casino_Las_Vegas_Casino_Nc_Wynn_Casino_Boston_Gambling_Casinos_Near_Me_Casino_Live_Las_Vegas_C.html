<p>The suspect, identified as Andrew Warrender, 32, was shot in the thighs and abdomen by a security officer, police said.</p>
<p>The suspect’s AR-15 style rifle had jammed after he aimed it at several people, and he later fired a shot, KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Warrender fell to the ground after he was wounded. He was hospitalized with several injuries. His current condition was not immediately available.</p>
<p>He was charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, discharging a firearm in an occupied structure, and attempted murder.</p>
<p>The shooting appeared to be “an isolated incident,” according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) Lt. Noe Esparza.</p>
<p>Murder Suspect Arrested Near Vegas Casino</p>
<p>A suspect was apprehended recently outside of the Silver Nugget Casino on a murder charge stemming from a deadly shooting that took place last October.</p>
<p>Marvin Lamar Smith, also known as “Gangster,” was arrested on Las Vegas Boulevard North. On June 15, he was booked for open murder with a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery with a deadly weapon, and two counts of drug possession.</p>
<p>He remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center and is scheduled to appear in local court next month.</p>
<p>The victim was identified as Dion “Juice” Southern. He was shot in the face by a single bullet from a .40 caliber handgun on October 3, KLAS reported.</p>
<p>Earlier, Smith had aimed a firearm at Truby McDowell, according to police. She was Southern’s girlfriend, police added.</p>
<p>McDowell also had allegedly stolen Smith’s stash of suspected methamphetamine (meth). He had tried to flirt with her, but she told him that Southern was her boyfriend, police said.</p>
<p>The incident led Smith and his brother, Richard Allen Smith, also known as “Bounce,” to get into a dispute with Southern.</p>
<p>Marvin Smith then allegedly shot Southern, who fell to the ground. He died a short time later.</p>
<p>The Smith brothers allegedly fled from the crime scene on bicycles.</p>
<p>Alleged Kidnapper Identified</p>
<p>The man who allegedly kidnapped a woman and two men last Friday has been identified and arrested.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Hair, 37, was charged with three counts of first-degree kidnapping with a deadly weapon, LVMPD police revealed on Monday. Other charges include evading, assault with a deadly weapon, and resisting a police officer with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>He was wounded during a standoff with police that took place on East Charleston Boulevard near Lamb Boulevard in east Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The incident began when a kidnapping victim texted Henderson, Nev. police to report she had been kidnapped by Hair, authorities said.</p>
<p>Hair drove the victims to Boulder City. Boulder City cops soon spotted the victim and Hair in a vehicle near US-95 and Black Hills Drive.</p>
<p>Officers began to chase the vehicle. LVMPD then got involved in the chase.</p>
<p>The vehicle was spotted at Owens Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard in Las Vegas. The vehicle was forcibly stopped by officers.</p>
<p>Hair Threatened to Shoot</p>
<p>Two victims fled from the vehicle. Hair remained in the vehicle and threatened to shoot the third hostage, who was still in the car. Hair had a 9mm handgun with him.</p>
<p>LVMPD Officer Jonathan Collingwood, 40, shot his rifle and wounded Hair. Hair was in critical condition at University Medical Center earlier this week.</p>
<p>One victim suffered glass fragments in his eye and was seen by doctors at the hospital. The woman also was treated at the hospital for unspecified reasons.</p>
<p>It was later found out the kidnapped woman was dating both Hair and a second man at the same time, police said.</p>
<p>Collingwood was put on administrative leave pending review of the shooting. That is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting.</p>
