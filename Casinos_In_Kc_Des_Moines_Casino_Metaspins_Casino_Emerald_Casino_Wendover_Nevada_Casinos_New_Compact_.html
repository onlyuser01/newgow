    <h1>Casinos In Kc Des Moines Casino Metaspins Casino Emerald Casino Wendover Nevada Casinos New Compact</h1>

<p>Thanks to the new contract, the Graton Resort and Casino will increase its slots exponentially and at the same time the Tribe will benefit from additional support from the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund (RSTF)</p>
<p>Graton Resort and Casino is a premium entertainment location in Rohnert Park, Sonoma County, California. The casino resort is operated and owned by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, a federally recognized Indian Tribe that includes the Southern Pomo Indians and the Coast Miwok Indians.</p>
<p>The go-to casino resort destination offers gambling entertainment such as slot machines, as well as table games. Visitors of the venue can also enjoy plenty of entertainment and dining outlets, making Graton Resort and Casino a perfect entertainment destination.</p>
<p>Currently, the casino resort offers 3,000 slot machines, but that number is expected to increase exponentially, thanks to a new gaming compact. According to the Sonoma County Gazette, the state of California and the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria inked a new gaming compact, that will enable the casino resort to increase the number of its slots.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new compact, the number of slots is expected to increase from 3,000 to 6,000. Thanks to this gaming compact, the Graton Resort and Casino would be among the venues with the highest number of slot machines in California.</p>
<p>The Change Is Expected to Boost Tourism</p>
<p>The increase in the number of slots at Graton Resort and Casino is expected to impact the venue positively. Having more slots will likely help boost tourism which in turn would help with economic stimulus for the area, as well as the Tribe.</p>
<p>Still, Tribe members have voiced their concerns about a potentially negative environmental impact from an increase in traffic. To address this, the Tribe introduced a traffic management plan that seeks to limit the negative impact on the environment, the recent report points out.</p>
<p>But the new gaming compact is expected to help further the Tribe via the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund. Thanks to the new compact the Tribe would benefit from additional support extending above the $1.1 million annual restriction. Ultimately, the support from the RSTF, as well as an increase in the number of slots are expected to provide an invaluable boost for the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria.</p>
<p>Recently, tribes in California voiced support for a new cardroom memorandum. Per the new proposal, cardrooms would have the option to expand and grow. At the same time, the proposal seeks to restrict the overpopulation of cardrooms by stopping new ones from opening doors.</p>
