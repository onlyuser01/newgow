<p>The call for proposals for a future casino resort in the City of Richmond is officially open with applicants able to submit proposals by February 22, 2021.</p>
<p>Richmond Launches Casino Resort Call for Proposals</p>
<p>After outlining a call for proposals action earlier in December, the City of Richmond is finally moving on with the next stage, Mayor Levar Stoney’s administration announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Moving forward, bidders for the establishment of a resort casino on the territory of the city or its outskirts are welcome to submit their proposals but do so no later than 3 pm on February 22, 2021, the official statement said.</p>
<p>The RFQ/P is now available for a resort casino in Richmond. When a proposal is selected, the project will be subject to a voter referendum in November of 2021. We recommend you check out this informational webpage to learn more about the process: https://t.co/SqS67p2XyL 1/2 pic.twitter.com/xJTVobkJNs — City of Richmond, VA (@CityRichmondVA) December 28, 2020</p>
<p>Once a proposal has been approved by the administration, though, it will be down to voters to assess its economic and societal benefits and drawbacks and vote on whether the project should be realized in the first place.</p>
<p>The selection process will be based on expert opinions, the local authority’s input as well as voters’ feedback. All of this is possible thanks to a previously signed piece of legislation that Virginia Governor Ralph Northam approved earlier this year and that is now headed for next year’s November ballot.</p>
<p>Before a referendum can take place, however, the city will have to approve one of the shortlisted candidates and pitch the proposal for voters to decide. The City of Richmond will seek a process that is transparent and allows voters to follow through with every stage of the planning.</p>
<p>Commenting on the future casino resort, or effort to build one, Mayor Stoney had this to add: “This competitive selection process will allow us to find the best opportunity for Richmond, an economic development project that includes well-paying jobs and workforce training opportunities.”</p>
<p>To qualify for the project, a successful applicant must present convincingly both economic and societal benefits for the community, Stoney concluded.</p>
