<p>Reputed Neighborhood Crips (NHC) gang member Jermall Campbell was held on a $1 million bond before his unexpected release last month, court filings show.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 20, 2021, Campbell, 40, was shooting craps with Deandre Freeman Sr, 47, a barber, and three other men at a house in the northeast Wichita suburbs.</p>
<p>Campbell went broke in the game, losing more than $1,000, according to the arrest report. When he asked Freeman to “front him some money,” an argument ensued. Freeman was shot 12 times and died at the scene. Police also found an unnamed victim on the couch with a gunshot wound to his neck. He survived.</p>
<p>Campbell went on the lam after the shooting but turned himself in a month later on July 21.</p>
<p>New Evidence</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office confirmed to the Eagle that the suspect had been released and an investigation was ongoing. The charges have been dismissed without prejudice, meaning they could be resurrected later.</p>
<p>Campbell’s lawyer, David Miller, said evidence discovered by the defense prompted prosecutors to drop the charges.</p>
<p>I have to give high regard to the DA’s office for looking at the evidence that we uncovered,” Miller said. He added that his client was “absolutely innocent of the crimes he was charged with.”</p>
<p>He declined to elaborate on the nature of the new evidence.</p>
<p>Long Rap Sheet</p>
<p>Campbell had been charged with first-degree premeditated murder, aggravated battery, a convicted felon’s criminal possession of a weapon, and illegal gambling.</p>
<p>He has a long rap sheet that includes domestic violence, arson, and illegal weapons possession. After being convicted in 2009 of charges related to murders of rival gang members, racketeering, and conspiracy, he also spent time in prison. Prosecutors, in that case, claimed Campbell was an NHC member.</p>
<p>On December 8, he allegedly attacked a nephew of Freeman’s in the Sedgwick County Jail. The Sheriff’s Office claimed Campbell entered the man’s cell and slashed him seven times with a shank.</p>
<p>Tragically, Freeman’s son, Deandre Freeman Jr, was also murdered in September 2013, a victim of gang violence. His alleged killer, Antonio Bell, died in jail before he could stand trial. Bell’s death resulted from a medical condition and was not believed to be suspicious.</p>
