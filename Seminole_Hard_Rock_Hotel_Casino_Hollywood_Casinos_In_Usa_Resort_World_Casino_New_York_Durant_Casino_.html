<p>San Francisco 49ers Can’t Hold On Against the Kansas City Chiefs</p>

<p>The San Francisco 49ers were dominant in their first two series against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. That gave them an early advantage and visions of redemption. But the Chiefs were just getting warmed up in this NFL Week 7 battle.</p>

<p>Quarterback Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 44-23 win over the Niners on Sunday. He had his first 400-plus-yard game of the season, passing for 423 and adding three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers have been dropping the over/under each week, as the under has dominated by a huge margin. However, this Chiefs-49ers matchup was one of several that blew the lines away.</p>
<p>San Fran Can’t Keep Up</p>
<p>49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo put up 303 yards and two touchdowns, and it looked like he was in control early on. However, he also had an interception and five sacks, which turned the tide.</p>
<p>From the outset, the Niners pushed the Chiefs’ defense 63 yards in 10 plays. New running back Christian McCaffrey, who just came over in a trade, gave the team some strength, and both he and tight end George Kittle had successful days. Still, they ultimately couldn’t get the job done.</p>
<p>On their next offensive drive, Garoppolo orchestrated a 34-yard, four-play drive that culminated in a TD pass to wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud. The Niners were now in charge, 10-0.</p>
<p>The Chiefs came alive as the first quarter dragged on. Mahomes set up a long 73-yard, nine-play drive to wide receiver Mecole Hardman for a TD. But the 49ers added another field goal in response.</p>
<p>A determined Chiefs offense turned made the score 14-13 just before halftime. Mahomes continued to own the field, and Hardman picked up another TD off a 25-yard run into the end zone.</p>
<p>Kansas City opened the second half with a drive designed to show San Fran who was in charge. A 61-yard kickoff return left Mahomes and his offense at the San Francisco 35-yard line, and a breakaway by running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire put them in front, 21-13.</p>
<p>The 49ers repeatedly tried to threaten the Chiefs’ control several times, often with a Garoppolo-Kittle combination. Kansas City responded each time with more points, and secured the game with a Mahomes delivery to wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster for the win.</p>
<p>The 49ers will take on the LA Rams in Week 8, while the Chiefs get some rest. They have a bye week, and won’t return until November 6, when they face the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>Jags Sniff Victory, Can’t Take Down Giants</p>
<p>The New York Giants came from behind and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 23-17, in a game that kept sports bettors glued to the action until the very end. QB Trevor Lawrence threw for 310 yards for the Jags, as he tried desperately to find success, and running back Travis Etienne gave a performance that all the fans wanted to see.</p>
<p>Etienne rushed for 114 yards and scored a TD as Jacksonville did everything it could to beat the Giants. On the last play of the game, wide receiver Christian Kirk was one yard away from tying the game. But the Giants’ defense stepped up when it counted the most. Kirk couldn’t push in for the score, the clock ran out, and the Giants held on.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the Jags hold a unique record for this game. They are the first team with a losing record to be favored against a 5-1 team in the NFL in the past 15 years. New York has something to brag about as well, as they are now five-time consecutive underdog champs.</p>
<p>Next Sunday, the Jags face the Denver Broncos, who are coming off a loss to the New York Jets. The Giants will head to Seattle to meet the Seahawks.</p>
