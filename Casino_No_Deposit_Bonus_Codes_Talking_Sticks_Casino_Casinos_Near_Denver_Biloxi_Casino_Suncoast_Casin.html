    <h1>Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Talking Sticks Casino Casinos Near Denver Biloxi Casino Suncoast Casin</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I want to tell a story that concerns this casino and will be interesting to everyone. I will try to describe all this as briefly as possible. I advise you to read to the end - and never register at the biamo.bet casino.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I registered at the biamo.bet casino and submitted the first documents for verification. Played in this casino and won some amount. At first glance, the casino does not look bad, I recommended this casino to my friend - this was the second mistake after registering on biamo.bet. In general, after I won a certain amount and made a withdrawal - they started attacking me with photo verification - like upload a selfie with a document on a different background - after 4 days, upload the photo again on a different background and time dragged on like that. My friend also played on his computer in this fake casino and also when he withdrew money and made a withdrawal, he got a quest in the form of an endless photo shoot with different backgrounds that were not verified and confirmed.</p>
<p>My friend is desperate because we can't pass the verification, he came to my house so that somehow we can finally pass this verification! Next, we took appropriate new photos and sent them from the email address to the verification department. But since we were at my house, my friend sent his photos from my mail, and accordingly, mine from his. I immediately noticed this error and wrote to the site's support service saying that we had mixed up the photo, to which I received an okay answer, since these are not the first photos that we sent, but this time we made a mistake with the mail .</p>
<p>THIS IS WHERE THE INTERESTING BEGINS! For several hours, my friend and I could not log into our accounts, as they were blocked, and the money, such as our deposits and winnings, was canceled - just as if the account did not exist. A letter was sent to the post office about the violation of the rules - multi-accounting, the most interesting thing is that we did not violate any of the rules, for example, we did not enter each other's account from the same computer or IP address, and there are no rules regarding mixed photos or e-mails. To the letters explaining the casino, they sent the same reply again that this is a multi-account and in the future all my letters are ignored. On the biamo.bet website, when I want to write in the chat, the chat is immediately blocked. This fake casino cannot provide any explanations or evidence for its accusations, I repeatedly asked to show the log of logins from the same IP, but no one answered because there is no such evidence or violations.</p>
<p>In general, this is the first time that I am in such a terrible situation - the casino is simply committing lawlessness, the money has been blocked (I have 400 euros in my account and my friend has about 900 euros). I will tell about this situation on all sites with the hope that no one in life will play anymore and will not become victims of biamo.bet fraudsters, I will also try to contact the authority that will issue them a license. There is a small chance that the casino will pay attention to this and solve this scam.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Because of such swindlers, people all over the world trust Internet casinos and other people less and less.</p>
<p>My email is for feedback, if anyone wants to ask questions or help stop these scammers please email me at nikwolen@outlook.com.</p>
<p>(I can provide all the evidence related to this fraud, because the casino has all the rights it wants - the client has no rules or protection)</p>
