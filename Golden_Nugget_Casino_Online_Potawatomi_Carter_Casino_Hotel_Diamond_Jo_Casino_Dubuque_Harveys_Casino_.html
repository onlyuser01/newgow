<p>The leading online provider that develops software for the gambling industry, CT Interactive, started 2023 with a new partnership. On Thursday the company revealed it joined forces with AdmiralBet Montenegro, a popular provider of online casino and sports betting services.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest collaboration, CT Interactive expanded the reach of its leading portfolio. Under the terms of the new collaboration, AdmiralBet customers are now going to access some of the most popular games from the leading developer.</p>
<p>Those games have already proven their popularity in different jurisdictions. Without any doubt, the new titles are going to be well-received, considering CT Interactive's continuously growing leadership position and quality of content.</p>
<p>Besides CT Interactive, the new collaboration benefits AdmiralBet as well. The new deal expands the offering for the gaming services provider by delivering new content. As with any regulated gambling market, new titles help gambling operators to solidify their presence, engage with new customers and retain existing clients.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 5, 2023, a representative for AdmiralBet Montenegro said: "We have witnessed how well the CT Interactive products are accepted around the gaming community, and we are confident that this is the right step for our business."</p>
<p>Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA, added: "AdmiralBet has a multi-layered platform that offers a diverse portfolio of intriguing content." Last but not least, she explained: "We see a lot of potential in the company, and we are excited to have our games positioned on such a fast-growing website."</p>
<p>CT Interactive's collaboration with AdmiralBet Montenegro comes on the heels of another important partnership. Only recently, the company expanded its content reach in Bulgaria via a collaboration with BetMarket. As a result, CT Interactive delivered its popular games for the operator, further expanding its presence in the country where it is headquartered.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Lachezar Petrov, CT Interactive's CEO, said: "We are excited to launch our games on the BetMarket site and to extend our reach at our domestic market with their growing customer base."</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in December, the developer added another company to its growing list of partners. The leading developer of iGaming titles inked a content deal with the global gaming operator, Planet Gaming NV. This partnership with Planet Gaming enabled CT Interactive to engage with new audiences and reach new markets.</p>
<p>Founded more than a decade ago, CT Interactive is currently a leading provider of software for the global gambling industry. Currently, the company's games are certified in 17 different jurisdictions and its portfolio of partners and content is continuously growing.</p>
