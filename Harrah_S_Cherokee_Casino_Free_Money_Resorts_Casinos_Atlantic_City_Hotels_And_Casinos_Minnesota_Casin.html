<p>Demi Gods II Expanded Edition review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The original Demi Gods II was a visually impressive slot that never quite got the traction it needed to become a classic. Demi Gods II Expanded Edition doubles down on the visuals, adds some bonus features and a couple of meta-game mechanics, but on the whole does not add enough to justify an entirely new release.</p>
<p>The gods of Olympus are well represented on the reels of this Spinometal's slot, with gorgeous backgrounds setting the scene in a stylised mix of high-fantasy and ancient myth.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics in Demi Gods II Expanded Edition, as in the original, are exceptionally high quality. Big faux-oil digital canvases depicting a rich and detailed world.</p>
<p>For example, different backgrounds and animations have been drawn for each of the various locations to which the bonus games take the player.</p>
<p>The animations are less distinctive than the art, but mesh well with the top quality sound and music design.</p>
<p>Top paying symbols can cover entire reels</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>With six reels, three rows and fifty winlines, the gameplay of Demi Gods II is pretty standard – something which even the fancy animations can’t hide.</p>
<p>The base game has a multiplier feature which randomly drops multipliers of either x2 or x3 onto the reels to increase wins for that spin, but on the whole most of its other innovations are in the bonus games (details below). Apart from that, this game plays as distinctly vanilla in tone.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spin symbol.</p>
<p>Landing three or more Free Spin symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spin bonus and will unlock the next "location" on the Free Spin Journey Map.</p>
<p>The Map has four locations, each of which represents a different format for the free spin bonus. For example, the first location – Hades, the land of the dead – has a Moving Reel feature. This means that on any winning spin, the reels move one to the right and the leftmost reel is respun. This continues until no further winning combinations occur.</p>
<p>The remaining three locations which are unlocked sequentially offer: Moving Wilds, which stay on the reels after they land and move to the left after each spin; Expanding Wilds, which expand to fill the reel they are on whenever they land; and in the final location Zeus will add four to seven Wild symbols to every single spin during the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>Once you have unlocked each location you do not have to use it. Instead, the player has the option to revisit old locations as many times as they like.</p>
<p>There are some new features in the Expanded version of Demi Gods II slot</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€500.00 per spin. While this covers a lot of ground, it doesn’t offer much in the way of options for small stakes players.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is also very low, which makes it an extremely poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies that favour the highest possible variance in the games we recommend.</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.1%. This is much too low for a recommendation, as we use a yardstick of roughly 96% as our average. Sometimes a low return to player can be made up for by other features, but the range of available bets and the low volatility do not help Demi Gods II Expanded Edition’s case.</p>
<p>High symbols paytable for Demi Gods II Expanded version slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Demi Gods II Expanded Edition adds a few features to the original, but still suffers from a very low return to player and even lower volatility.</p>
<p>No matter how good the design of the visuals and gameplay, this slot simply can’t escape the poor maths that underlies it all.</p>
<p>As a result, we suggest you give this one a pass.</p>
