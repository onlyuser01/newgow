<p>GiG and News Corp UK &amp; Ireland are targeting an entry into the US as their next step</p>
<p>Gaming technology and sports media company Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) announced it has expanded its commercial partnership with News Corp UK &amp; Ireland to gain access to the Irish market.</p>
<p>Expanding into Ireland</p>
<p>The new agreement between GiG and News Corp UK &amp; Ireland will see the cloud-based technology and media provider enter and establish a presence in Ireland, offering casino and sports betting content and exclusive offers.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, the Irish Sun’s website now features a dedicated content hub for all betting-related content to serve as a go-to place for readers where they can find all information that they need.</p>
<p>GiG and the parent of prominent UK brands talkSPORT and The Sun initially partnered in December last year to deliver sports betting and casino content, as well as exclusive offers to customers in the UK, seeking to benefit from existing synergies between the partners.</p>
<p>To facilitate the partnership then, News Corp agreed to present the betting and gaming content in dedicated sections on both talkSPORT and The Sun websites, ensuring visibility and easy access to the offers for anyone interested.</p>
<p>The collaboration debuted with content on the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and now, two months later, it already proved to be successful in delivering material revenues to GiG Media as the division posted an all-time high in fourth-quarter revenue of €17.8 million ($18.9 million), or an increase of 40% year-over-year, further incentivizing its expansion to include customers in Ireland.</p>
<p>Targeting US Entry</p>
<p>GiG and News Corp UK &amp; Ireland would be interested in further expanding their collaboration and entering new markets, with a special focus placed on customers in the US, a market the partners expect to enter by the end of the first business quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, GiG announced last month a deal with an unnamed established land-based and digital casino operator in Switzerland to provide it with its player account management (PAM) solution for a period of five years, enter the lucrative Swiss market and capitalize on the rapid growth of the iGaming vertical in the country.</p>
<p>Outside of Europe, GiG signed an agreement with Ontario-based operator Casino Time earlier in the month to power its operations by providing platform, sportsbook and omnichannel solutions.</p>
<p>Casino Time, which is the fifth operator to partner with GiG since the tech supplier obtained approval from the Alcohol and Gambling Commission of Ontario in July 2022, is planning to go live in the second quarter of 2023.</p>
