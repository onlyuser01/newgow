    <h1>Mgm Grand Detroit Casino Resort Casino Near Me Casinos Oregon Lincoln City Casino New Online Casino</h1>

<p>Dear susuquen,</p>
<p>Information provided by the 3rd party is not the casino's responsibility and it cannot influence it. We update our reviews and data regularly according to the data on the casinos' websites. Casinos change their terms and conditions from time to time and it is not possible to keep the data for several thousands of casinos up to date, although we are usually informed about the changes. Therefore, I am sure you can find an additional bonus condition in every bonus on our website - full terms apply. It means that if there is any mismatch between the information on our website and the casino's terms, the casino's bonus terms prevail. It is a rare situation, but unfortunately, it can happen. A player is mandatory to read all terms and conditions that are accepted upon registration on the website. If there is a mismatch, it is possible to ask the casino to explain it.</p>
<p>"To look at the situation theoretically, the max cashout stated by casino.guru when I signed up and completed the cycle is 400 €. I had a problem that day and could not withdraw the money, so I filed a complaint on casino.guru. The next day, when my case was examined, this bonus was reduced to 100 €. In this case, the maximum casout I can withdraw should be 400 €, is it 100 €? So, is the next rule valid for me to sign up and get the bonus, or is it the changed rule? You already have records of money changing. So you can confirm or disprove my theory."</p>
<p>When exactly did you sign up and complete the bonus requirements, please? In any case, even if a mistake appeared, the casino's bonus terms and conditions are still valid without any change. It means the maximum cashout from the bonus is €100. That is reality, not theory. But, it also depends on a specific situation.</p>
<p>"Let me also point out that if they wanted me to make a deposit and verify it one more time through Mifinity, this would not have been possible because Mifintiy cannot be used when deposit in casino sites due to the laws in Turkey. So, after all, I paid via Bitcoin and withdrawn money via mifinty. (normally this is not allowed due to money laundering policy but I guess it is at the discretion of the casino)"</p>
<p>I do not understand the question - "if they wanted"... - you were allowed to withdraw your funds via the available payment method. I think there is nothing more to discuss.</p>
<p>Question 1) - please provide me with the information I asked for above, about signing up and completing the bonus requirements. Then I will look at it again in more detail.</p>
<p>Question 2) - if a player is requested to make a deposit before making a withdrawal, it is logical that the player adjusts the currency and payment method for deposit to the account currency. If the bonus is offered in fiat currency, the player can withdraw funds via the payment method supporting fiat currency. This is clear, too. The casino was able to pay out your funds. Once you get in trouble, I believe the casino can help you to resolve your issues and provide you with an alternative solution. Just ask.</p>
<p>To be honest, every complaint/case is different and there are many factors that can influence the whole situation. There are no exact answers to your questions and I guess there is no point in discussing imaginary scenarios.</p>
