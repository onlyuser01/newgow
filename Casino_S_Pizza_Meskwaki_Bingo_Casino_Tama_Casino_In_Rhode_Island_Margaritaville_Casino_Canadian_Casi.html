    <h1>Casino S Pizza Meskwaki Bingo Casino Tama Casino In Rhode Island Margaritaville Casino Canadian Casi</h1>

<p>Joe Kaminkow has stepped into the expanded position as Chief Innovation Officer at Aristocrat Gaming, the company announced on Monday. Kaminkow comes at an important time for the company, as Aristocrat seeks to expand digitally and in the wake of an important rebranding of its online Real Money Gaming (RMG) division to Anaxi.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Brings in Trusted Industry Veteran to Spearhead Innovation</p>
<p>Anaxi is the third business unit for the Group, along with Pixel United and Aristocrat Gaming, and it’s preparing the company’s global pivot in the iCasino vertical. Kaminkow will focus on driving innovation for Aristocrat’s entire operation with an emphasis on developing new gaming and mobile game genres.</p>
<p>The executive will also seek to create an environment in which world-class talent can thrive, and it builds on Kaminkow’s association with Aristocrat Gaming in the first place. He started out as SVP of game development back in 2013. He will work with Matt Primmer, the CPO of Aristocrat Gaming, and will assist teams across all three business divisions.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Gaming CEO Hector Fernandez welcomed the appointment and said that working with someone of Kaminkow’s caliber was going to help the company drive innovation and explore new growth opportunities while bringing even more talent to the team. Fernandez added:</p>
<p>As a valued colleague and contributor to our success for almost a decade, Joe’s brilliance and creativity is well-known to us at Aristocrat Gaming and across the industry. Aristocrat Gaming</p>
<p>He also said that the company was now looking forward to seeing Kaminkow in action in helping develop the Group’s teams and elevate its portfolio to the next level. Kaminkow is definitely no chance to hire as well.</p>
<p>Seasoned Veteran with Plenty to Offer Aristocrat</p>
<p>He worked as CCO at Zynga, and he has more than 130 patents in various related fields, such as networks, game design, operations, and more. His ideas have contributed to the realization of 1,500 games across numerous markets and formats.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to expand my commitment to Aristocrat in a dedicated, full-time role, enabling me to devote my creative energies to all areas of the Group’s ongoing growth and success,” he said. He commended the determination of the Group’s employees to remain competitive and at the forefront of technology and he added that he is honored to have been entrusted with the opportunity to further develop the portfolio.</p>
