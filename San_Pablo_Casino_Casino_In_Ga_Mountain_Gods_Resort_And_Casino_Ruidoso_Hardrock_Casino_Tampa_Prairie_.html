    <h1>San Pablo Casino Casino In Ga Mountain Gods Resort And Casino Ruidoso Hardrock Casino Tampa Prairie</h1>

<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (PAGCOR) has reported a 62% increase in the number of people that have registered for its self-exclusion service in 2022 in comparison to 2021</p>
<p>The total number of self-inclusion requests for the whole of 2022 was 333, while the requests in 2021 were only 206. The 2022 number was the highest on record for the past four years. This is mainly due to the COVID restrictions that were in place for casinos during 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>157 of the Self-Exclusion Requests Came Directly from Players</p>
<p>As per information provided by the Philippines’ National Database for Restricted Persons (NDRP), 157 out of the 333 self-exclusion requests came from gamblers themselves. This was 67% higher than the 94 individual players that decided to self-exclude in 2021. The remaining 176 requests for exclusions in 2022 came from family members of problem gamblers. This number was 36% higher than the 112 gamblers whose families considered they have a gambling problem in 2021.</p>
<p>The NDRP is an electronic database that includes information about all individuals that have been restricted from gambling upon their own request or upon the request of a close family member due to concerns about gambling addiction. The database is being run and regulated by PAGCOR which also owns and operates all of the gambling venues in the Philippines.</p>
<p>PAGCOR’s self-exclusion program was established in 2013 and ever since then, data is compiled about every self-exclusion request. According to the data in the NDRP, since September 2013, 2,532 people have made self-exclusion requests. 770 out of those requests were registered as active as of December 31, 2022. PAGCOR also reported that the self-exclusion requests that expired in 2022 were a total of 598.</p>
<p>Looking back, however, the self-exclusion numbers in 2017 and 2018 were higher than those reported for 2022. According to NDRP, the requests for 2017 were 447 and 2018 saw the highest number with 448.</p>
<p>The Philippines Gambling Industry Expected to Grow to $10B in 2027</p>
<p>According to the latest analysis by GCG Gaming Advisory Services, the gross gaming revenue in the Philippines will most likely grow to $10 billion by 2027. The Philippines have experienced very consistent growth in the gambling sector. The industry will most likely recover to revenue levels from before the pandemic by hitting $5 billion in 2023 and it is expected that it will continue to grow.</p>
<p>GCG analysts think the gambling industry will continue on its growth path as international travel is back and with open borders, visitation numbers will gradually increase over the next months. Particularly tourists from South Korea, China, and Japan are interested to come and take advantage of Philippine casinos but locals also seem to be eager to spend money on gambling.</p>
