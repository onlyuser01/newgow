    <h1>Plaza Hotel Casino Reviews Casino Nashville Wheeling Wv Casino Tama Casino Casino Real Money No Depo</h1>

<p>Hi, I had a $5002.40 win at POKIEMATE 27th November 2020. Upload of required documentation was all done correctly and i withdrew $4500 then I was told my winnings would be void for playing above the maximum bet but I was confused as I never exceeded a bet of $6.50 and consistently and play history shows I keep my bets between $2.50-$5.00. When i looked at my game history in the last 10 minutes of play my bets jumped from no higher than $5 to $12.50 and then I noticed that the times recorded on the play history differed from my internet history/banking records/email history (correspondence of deposit/withdrawal etc)/ time shown on the game itself on POKIEMATE site. There was an odd time of just shy of an hours difference between my screenshots of the night (im careful to record these things due to problems historically). There was also records in my play history that showed me playing at a time I can prove with screenshots I wasn't even playing a game on the site or interacting with any pokie games. This history shows extremely outrageous betting that ($12.50-$50 per bet) would indicate that i gambled away any money I had won that night leaving me with pretty much $0.00. When bringing this up to the site they have claimed the records are in GMT +10 time but the figures still don't add up and I have not stopped emailing them since. When presenting another argument with them at the beginning of this week after two weeks of responses they have finally stopped replying. Surprisingly i'm not locked out of my account yet.</p>
<p>Also, not only were the times different between day of play and history recorded but a week after my intial communications around the 29th, when i looked up the history again 4th December the times had been changed yet again.</p>
