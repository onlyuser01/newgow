    <h1>New Instant Withdrawal Casino Cast From Casino Mgm Casino Springfield Heaps Of Wins Casino Casino Fr</h1>

<p>Initial interest from both the industry and sports bettors in Vermont is strong, Ryan Harper said</p>
<p>Vermont online sports betting has finally become a reality, allowing local customers to play with three of America’s largest operators. In addition to that, Catena Media, one of North America’s most influential sports betting affiliates, has now launched online sports betting affiliation in the state.</p>
<p>The short list of online sports betting operators available in The Green Mountain State includes Fanatics, FanDuel and DraftKings. As a leading affiliate, Catena Media has existing agreements with both FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>According to the affiliate’s announcement, all of its national brands are “carrying strong Vermont content” to celebrate the launch of online sports betting in the state. Catena Media added that this coverage is complemented by content published by the group’s media partners, including NJ.com and TheSportingNews.com.</p>
<p>Catena Media pointed out that Vermont is the last of the New England states to launch online sports betting. The affiliate specialist also pointed out that The Green Mountain State is the first new US betting market to launch in 2024.</p>
<p>The state has an adult population of roughly half a million, which will now be able to enjoy the three sportsbooks’ offerings and Catena Media’s content.</p>
<p>Ryan Harper, Catena Media’s vice president for North America, commented on Catena Media’s foray into the state of Vermont, praising the interest in affiliation from both the industry and sports bettors.</p>
<p>Initial interest from both the industry and sports bettors in Vermont is strong. Vermonters have enjoyed online daily fantasy sports products and horse-race wagering so are no strangers to the online market. Ryan Harper, VP for NA, Catena Media</p>
<p>Having launched in Vermont, Catena Media’s affiliation services are now available in over 28 US states and Canadian provinces. The company remains bullish on expanding in North America and launching in new betting markets.</p>
<p>Speaking of new betting markets, North Carolina is also set to launch sports betting soon, becoming the next state where wagering on professional sporting events is legal. Speaking of North Carolina, the state failed to legalize Las Vegas-style resorts but concerned customers believe that lawmakers are not ready to give up and continue to lay down the foundations for such projects.</p>
