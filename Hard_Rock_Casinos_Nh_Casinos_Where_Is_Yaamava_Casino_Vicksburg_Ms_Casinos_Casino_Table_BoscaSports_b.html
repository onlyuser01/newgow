<p>BoscaSports, the leading digital solutions provider for screens in Europe, extended its partnership with britbet, the pool betting provider of more than 55 British racecourses.</p>
<p>britbet and BoscaSports Extend Their Betting Display Deal</p>
<p>Building on an existing collaboration, the duo extended their partnership deal for three years. Under the terms of the extended partnership, BoscaSports will continue to supply its displays for britbet. Since its launch in 2018, britbet has collaborated with BoscaSports using their cutting-edge displays.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the digitalization efforts have helped completely overhaul the British racecourse experience since then. The cutting-edge displays improve the experience for racecourse visitors by offering live data. Such data includes tips, live pricing, race card data and other important details available live for racecourse visitors.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have agreed this extension, especially so in the run up to Cheltenham, the biggest event we operate at.” Nigel Roddis, managing director at britbet</p>
<p>Britbet’s managing director, Nigel Roddis, said that the company is pleased to extend its collaboration with BoscaSports. Moreover, he outlined that the deal comes at a time for the Cheltenham Festival, which is the biggest event that britbet operates at.</p>
<p>According to Roddis, the company has approximately 3,000 of BoscaSports’ screens in different racecourses. He outlined that thanks to this partnership, race fans can see betting data “in a vibrant, modern format.” In conclusion, Roddis said that the screens also help deliver promoting messages to racegoers.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Benefits for Racegoers</p>
<p>BoscaSports’ chief executive, Eugene Mitchell, added that since britbet’s launch, the duo has created a strong business partnership. He explained that the company is now delighted to further extend its collaboration with britbet. Moreover, Mitchell said that BoscaSports and britbet both “share a passion for delivering the best betting experience for the betting public.” In conclusion, he said that the company is looking forward to “driving further innovation with britbet.”</p>
<p>“We have developed a strong partnership with britbet since its launch and we are delighted to further extend the relationship.” Eugene Mitchell, chief executive at Bosca Sports</p>
<p>Currently, BoscaSports is operating screens in 85 racecourses in the UK, as well as 86 racecourses in Ireland. That makes more than 5,000 high-end screens available for betting shops, racecourses and bookmakers. What is more, only recently, the provider of digital displays joined forces with Paddy Power last month. As a result, by the end of the year, more than 40 Paddy Power-branded venues in the UK and Ireland will undergo digitalization and feature BoscaSports’ displays.</p>
