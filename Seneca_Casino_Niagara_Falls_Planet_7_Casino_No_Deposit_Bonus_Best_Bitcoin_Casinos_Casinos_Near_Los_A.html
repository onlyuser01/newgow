<p>New Orleans Saints Putting Their Hopes Into Derek Carr</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints have a new quarterback, and he seems as if heâ€™s capable of taking this team to the postseason for the first time in the post-Drew Brees era. The man in question is the former Las Vegas Raiders QB, Derek Carr.</p>
<p>The four-time Pro Bowler made his debut last weekend against the Titans. We saw him go 23-for-33 for 305 yards and one touchdown. One of his passes did get intercepted, but overall, he did a fine job. Carr is expected to do at least as equally well in Week 2.</p>
<p>Heâ€™s 2-0 against the Panthers in his pro career, but he hasnâ€™t played against them since 2020. Nevertheless, he should do well as the boys from North Carolina just donâ€™t seem too great in 2023.</p>
<p>A Horrible Season Ahead of the Carolina Panthers?</p>
<p>Is the 2023 season going to be horrible for the Carolina Panthers? Judging by what we saw from them in Week 1, the answer is yes. They got destroyed by the Falcons 24-10 in which their rookie quarterback Bryce Young threw two interceptions.</p>

<p>He did throw for one touchdown, as well as recorded 146 passing yards, going 20-for-38, which isnâ€™t too bad. However, those stats certainly arenâ€™t giving Carolinaâ€™s fans much hope for the remainder of the season. Sure, the 22-year-old probably has a great future ahead of him, but in 2023, he just doesnâ€™t look like someone who could take the Panthers to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not just because they donâ€™t have an accomplished quarterback; itâ€™s also because the rest of the team isnâ€™t great either.</p>
<p>Saints vs. Panthers Prediction</p>
<p>One of our Saints vs. Panthers predictions is that the boys from New Orleans are going 2-0 after Week 2. Another prediction for the MNF game is that theyâ€™re going to cover the spread. Their offense led by Derek Carr is bound to do well, while their defense should be able to tame Young and his teammates.</p>
<p>Picks: New Orleans Saints to win and cover the spread</p>
