<p>Global supplier of gaming technology and solutions International Game Technology (IGT) released today its third quarter earnings report raising its full-year 2021 forecast.</p>
<p>Revenue, Operating Income and EBITDA</p>
<p>Continuing right where it ended the second quarter, IGT revealed revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2021, was $984 million, an increase of 21% on $816 million generated in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>IGT’s Global Lottery business accounted for $652 million, up 14%, while Global Gaming added another $289 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. New Digital &amp; Betting division, which reported financial results for the first time, posted $43 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Broad-based momentum across our Lottery, Gaming, and Digital &amp; Betting activities drove significant improvement in key financial and performance metrics in the third quarter.” Marco Sala, CEO, IGT</p>
<p>Operating income across IGT’s divisions was $234 million in Global Lottery, an increase of 19% compared to the third quarter of 2020, and $31 million in Global Gaming to reverse a loss of $56 million in Q3 2020 and drive the total increase of operating income to $144 million.</p>
<p>In the expenses, IGT accounted for $26 million in corporate support expenses, up 54% year-over-year, and $40 million in other expenses, marginally down 5%, which contributed to the huge increase in operating income by 144% year-over-year. Operating margin in the reported quarter doubled to 22%, from 11% in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>We are supporting strong top-line growth with strategic investments in the business while still making good progress on optimizing our cost structure.” Max Chiara, CFO, IGT</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA came at $407 million, comprised of $347 million in Global Lottery, $64 million in Global Gaming, $15 million in Digital &amp; Betting and a $19-million loss from corporate support expense. Q3 2021 adjusted EBITDA was up 42% year-over-year, while EBITDA margin was 41%, one of the highest readings in the company’s history.</p>
<p>Cost-Savings and Debt Decrease</p>
<p>Among the main contributors IGT cited was the high profit flow-through of Global Lottery same-store sales growth, high-margin lottery sales in Italy and strong overall operating leverage, as well as disciplined cost management, including benefits from OPtiMa structural cost-savings program.</p>
<p>IGT managed to draw its net debt down to $6.1 billion from $7.3 billion at the end of December 2020, with net debt leverage down from 6.4x to 3.8x driven by strong cash flow generation and proceeds.</p>
<p>The decrease in net debt supported by lower interest rates led to a decrease in net interest expense to $79 million from $101 million in the prior year, while the higher revenue and operating profit, as well as a reduction in foreign exchange losses, resulted in net income of $101 million, compared to a net loss of $129 million for the respective period in 2020.</p>
<p>IGT finished the third quarter with $2.2 billion of total liquidity, of which $435 million in unrestricted cash and $1.8 billion in additional borrowing capacity. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share and updated its full-year 2021 forecast.</p>
<p>IGT now expects to finish 2021 with cash from operations between $850 million and $900 million, driven by an increased operating income, with $100 million to $900 million, derived from revenues of around $4.1 billion.</p>
