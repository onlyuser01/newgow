    <h1>Game Room Casino Casinos In Oklahoma Durant Casinos Near Nashville Tn Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta C</h1>

<p>Hi Kristina,</p>
<p>I appreciate you looking into this matter for me.</p>
<p>To be clear, there was no irregular gameplay on my behalf, I'm not even quite sure how I would go about playing irregularly! I have one account with them, that is all.</p>
<p>I did indeed receive my payout. I actually ended up creating 2 Bitcoin accounts in order to receive my withdrawal from them. So the first one I couldn't figure out, and then the second one with Coinbase worked successfully.</p>
<p>I joined with them in October and have been receiving free spins through email. These usually came in every couple days or so, which I , for the most part usually played.</p>
<p>What irks me about the situation, is that after the expected runaround to get the withdrawal, I also had to deposit 35.00 in order to get it. I feel as if, as soon as I deposited they closed my account.</p>
<p>In my eyes they had no legitimate reason to close my account, but had gotten money from me, and that's all they wanted. It just doesn't sit right with me.</p>
<p>I scoured those terms and conditions, and could not find anything about making a deposit to claim winnings, nor did I see anything about only being able to withdraw to Bitcoin. In fact it clearly states that you can only withdraw to the same account you deposited from.</p>
<p>I think that the only other correspondence from them were the free spins emails, which there are numerous, from October, up until I made my deposit.</p>
<p>If you would like to see those , or if there is anything else I can provide, please don't hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to address this. I hope your holidays were great, and, that you and your family are happy and healthy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Stephanie M***</p>
