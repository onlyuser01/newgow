<p>A maximum of 300 patrons will be allowed at Star Sydney casino property following restrictions which were rolled by the New South Wales government.</p>
<p>COVID-19 Restrictions at Star Sydney Casino Property Rolled Back</p>
<p>Star Entertainment has announced the rollback of restrictions at its Star Sydney casino property. The restrictions are aimed at reducing the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19. The Australian operator follows the guidelines by the New South Wales (NSW) government order released earlier this week. According to the new order, hospitality venues like cafes, restaurants, casinos and other businesses are allowed: “Maximum of 300 people in the venue at any one time or one customer per 4 square meters, whichever is the lesser.“</p>
<p>Consequently, Star Entertainment announced the new restrictions. According to the company’s announcement, the access to the gaming venue will be restricted to members of The Star Club only. The company said that:</p>
<p>Diamond Members can bring 2 guests</p>
<p>Platinum Members can bring 1 guest</p>
<p>Gold Members can bring 1 guest</p>
<p>Furthermore, the operator noted that due to the restrictions currently in place, Silver members won’t be allowed to bring a guest. Visitors of the Star Sydney casino property must also provide contact details upon entry. Star Entertainment added that although the gaming floor will look differently because of the COVID-19 safe plan which is implemented, team members will be assisting the guests. In addition, the company said that temperature checks are introduced for all guests and team members.</p>
<p>A Step Back</p>
<p>Looking back a few months, casinos and many other entertainment and hospitality businesses were shut down back in mid-March. This was part of an effort by the NSW government to reduce the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19. Then in June, the government allowed the casinos to reopen their doors. This is when Star Sydney resumed operations. The operator gradually increased the number of guests that can attend at the venue. At the same time Star Entertainment followed the updates from the NSW government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Star Entertainment lifted some of the restrictions which were previously implemented. As a result, up to 5,000 guests at any time were allowed to attend from July 1. With that in mind, given the newly rolled back restrictions, the Star Sydney casino is now operating under significantly decreased capacity.</p>
