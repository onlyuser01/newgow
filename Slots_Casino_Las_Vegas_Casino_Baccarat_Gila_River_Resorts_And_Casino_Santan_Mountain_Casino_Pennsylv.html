<p>American audiences will get to experience the modern classic for the first time</p>
<p>Australian gaming content developer Big Time Gaming (BTG) is launching one of its best slots in the United States. Thanks to the supplier’s One Stop Shop aggregation agreement with Evolution, the six-reel Golden Catch Megaways slot will go live in several US markets.</p>
<p>Launching on July 19, the game will be available to operators in Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. As a result, many American players will get to experience the premium fishing-themed game.</p>
<p>In Golden Catch players take charge of a fishing fleet exploring the seas for valuable fish. The innovative title features some exciting mechanics, greatly diversifying the gameplay. The Megaways mechanic pioneered by BTG provides up to 117,649 ways to win every spin.</p>
<p>In addition, boats may appear above the reels and drop anchor, removing winning symbols and revealing additional Fish Bonus Prizes. Such prizes are awarded for each boat above the reels. Golden boats multiply Fish Bonus Prizes by 10.</p>
<p>Free Spins Mode Will Amaze US Audiences</p>
<p>In addition, players can trigger Free Spins mode where Boat Multipliers are unlimited. The innovative Win Exchange mechanic increases player’s chances to trigger Free Spins. The feature allows players to exchange their entire win for 10 Free Spins each time they win between 25 and 100 times their bet.</p>
<p>If players wish to directly skip to the action, they can click on the Bonus Buy icon and buy 10 Free Spins for 100 times their stake. This will allow them to instantly enjoy the best part of the game while providing them with chances to win huge prizes.</p>
<p>Evolution and BTG Are Excited to Launch Golden Catch in the USA</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming’s chief executive officer, Nik Robinson, commented on the launch of this classic title in the US. He noted that the game was hugely popular in Europe and that his team hopes that it will replicate this success in the United States.</p>
<p>We think you’re going to fall for Golden Catch hook, line, and sinker. With its hugely engaging base game and astounding bonus feature, this slot was a huge hit in Europe, and we predict it will become a big favorite in the US too. Nik Robinson, CEO, BTG</p>
<p>Evolution’s chief commercial officer, Jeff Millar, also shared his thoughts on the launch, praising BTG as an “absolute game-changer” in the iGaming space. He noted that Golden Catch has cemented itself as a modern classic, which is why Evolution is excited to allow American audiences to experience it.</p>
<p>Now, we’re starting to roll BTG games out to the US markets, and it’s great to see how much they resonate with a US audience. It just goes to show that a good game is universal. Jeff Millar, CCO, Evolution</p>
<p>Last month, BTG rolled out another Megaways title called Big Bad Bison. The title was later launched in Ontario.</p>
