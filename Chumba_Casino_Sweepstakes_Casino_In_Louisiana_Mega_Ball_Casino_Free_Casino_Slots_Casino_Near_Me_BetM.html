<p>The property will add to the vibrancy of downtown Cincinnati, the chief financial officer of the Cincinnati Reds believes</p>
<p>Gambling giant BetMGM has announced the opening of a new sportsbook in downtown Cincinnati. BetMGM Sportsbook at The Banks is now ready to welcome its first guests.</p>
<p>Previously located at the Great American Ball Park, the sportsbook has now been moved to its permanent spot. The property boasts a 350-square-foot video wall and 42 TV screens, allowing sports fans to never miss a beat.</p>
<p>In addition to that, BetMGM Sportsbook at The Banks has 3 in-person wagering windows, 14 self-service wagering kiosks, over 200 seats and an exclusive lounge for VIP patrons. The lounge has a private bar, high-definition screens and comfortable seats, turning betting into a truly luxurious experience.</p>
<p>The property is ready to welcome sports fans every day of the week.</p>
<p>The Sportsbook Will Add to the Vibrancy of Downtown Cincinnati</p>
<p>BetMGM’s chief revenue officer, Matt Prevost, said that the launch of the new sportsbook is an “integral part” of delivering the BetMGM experience to the Buckeyes. He revealed that his team was considering this property even before BetMGM’s official launch in Ohio.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to see this vision become a reality marking our next big next step in growing our relationship with the city of Cincinnati and the Reds. Matt Prevost, CRO, BetMGM</p>
<p>For reference, BetMGM is currently serving as the official sports betting partner of the Cincinnati Reds. Because of that, Doug Healy, the franchise’s official chief financial officer, praised the launch of the BetMGM Sportsbook at The Banks.</p>
<p>Moving the BetMGM Sportsbook to The Banks places this best-in-class operator into the heart of our city’s sports and entertainment district. The popularity of the BetMGM brand will help draw patrons to The Banks and add to the vibrancy of our downtown. Doug Healy, CFO, Cincinnati Reds</p>
<p>The sportsbook was also welcomed by The Banks’ marketing director and property manager, Tracy Schwegmann. She said that the betting venue would be a great addition to The Banks, helping it remain an attractive entertainment destination.</p>
<p>With the Bengals season starting and the Reds making a push to playoffs, The Banks continues to be the #1 entertainment destination in Cincinnati. Tracy Schwegmann, marketing director &amp; property manager, The Banks</p>
<p>Earlier this month, BetMGM also enhanced its betting app, just in time for the highly-anticipated National Football League season.</p>
<p>In other news, BetMGM recently formed a partnership with Play’n GO in Virginia, helping the provider expand its US reach.</p>
