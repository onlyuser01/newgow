<p>The leading dynamic games development studio, BF Games, announced a new partnership with the fast-growing European gambling platform Winbet. The duo joined forces Tuesday and under the terms of the new deal, BF Games will bring more than a dozen of its leading games to customers in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Overall, BF Games will launch 15 games for customers in Bulgaria via its deal with Winbet. Those titles include some of the most popular titles recently released such as Wild Jack Remastered, Buffalo Trail, Book of Gods and Cave of Fortune. Besides newly released games, customers in Bulgaria will be able to access BF Games' classics including Ramses Rising, Stunning Hot Remastered and Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
<p>In a statement released on November 1, 2022, Claudia Melcaru, BF Games' Head of Business Development, acknowledged that the company has seen a successful year so far and this marks another major achievement. She added: "We're delighted to take so many of our top-performing titles live in the Bulgarian market via Winbet and look forward to seeing how the operatorâ€™s players react to them."</p>
<p>Currently, Winbet is among the leading operators in Bulgaria. The leading gambling platform offers roulette, slots, table games, as well as live casino games. In addition, Winbet offers a sportsbook as well. Now, thanks to the recent deal with BF Games, the brand's portfolio in the country will expand even further and provide engaging entertainment.</p>
<p>BF Games' entry into the Bulgarian market complements the company's ongoing expansion to new European jurisdictions. In fact, the deal with Winbet comes on the heels of another strategic deal inked late last month. Late in October, BF Games inked a similar deal with Gamanza for the Swiss market. As a result, the company launched 20 of its leading titles for the regulated gambling market in Switzerland.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Melcaru pointed out that the entry in Switzerland marks another important milestone for the company. She said: "Our focus on growth in rich markets has allowed us to thrive and with some exciting news to come within the Swiss market, this is just the beginning of another thrilling journey for us."</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in October, BF Games expanded its presence in Romania via a deal with Favbet.ro. This saw the company introduce engaging content for the leading operator, expanding further its offering. Earlier this year, BF Games also expanded to Latvia and Croatia. Undoubtedly, entering new regulated jurisdictions and expanding its global growth remains a key priority for BF Games.</p>
