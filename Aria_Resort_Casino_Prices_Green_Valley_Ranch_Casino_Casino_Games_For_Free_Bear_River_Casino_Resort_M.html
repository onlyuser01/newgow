<p>As COVID-19 measures begin disappearing in Las Vegas and Nevada, Boyd Gaming announced that it is returning to 100% capacity operations for its gaming floors in the state.</p>
<p>Full Capacity for Boyd Gaming’s Casino Properties in Las Vegas Now Reality</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming is the latest casino operator to ramp up its operational limit to 100% of its gaming floor capacity following an official go-ahead by the CDC and Nebraska gaming regulators on Thursday. Commenting on the news in an official press release, Boyd Gaming said that all of its nine properties in and around Las Vegas would restart at full capacity without any limitations on-site as per state gaming regulators’ approvals.</p>
<p>The news coincides with another announcement that mandatory face coverings are no longer required on a federal level for patrons who have received full COVID-19 vaccinations, with each gaming property now free to determine how it wishes to address regulating casino floors on its own.</p>
<p>However, the 100% capacity only applies to the gaming floors, with the rest of the company’s amenities still operating at 80 of their capacity. Non-gaming floors are likely to retain their social distancing measures in place for another few weeks as restaurants, retail, and entertainment facilities are preparing to welcome back tourists in what could be a very strong season for Nevada’s leisure industry.</p>
<p>While the bulk of Boyd’s portfolio in Nevada has restarted, the Main Street Station and the Eastside Cannery properties will remain shuttered until further notice. Boyd explained that it had received formal approval to renew operations following regulatory recognition of the continuous efforts the gaming operator has put in curbing the further spread of COVID-19 as well as focus on keeping patrons, visitors, and members of staff safe.</p>
<p>An Overall Recovery for the Casino Sector in Nevada</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming is not the only property returning to normalcy, though, and others, including Red Rock Resorts, MGM Resorts International, and Caesars Entertainment all restarting at full capacity. A total of 18 Strip casinos will be welcoming back patrons at 100% capacity starting immediately with the area’s iconic venues opening once again.</p>
<p>Extending the full capacity measure to casinos and casino workers is not surprising as Gov. Steve Sisolak has confirmed on several occasions that Nevada will seek to support its tourism industry which is essential to the state’s economic recovery.</p>
<p>Vaccination of casino employees and frontline workers has been crucial, and businesses, such as Wynn Resorts, have urged their employees to get vaccinated so they can start returning back to work without having to wear masks.</p>
