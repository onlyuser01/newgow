    <h1>Directions To Soboba Casino River Rock Casino Resort The Hotel Epoch Casino Stagecoach Hotel And Cas</h1>

<p>The cutting-edge casino software provider for the global gambling industry that is also a part of the renowned Gauselmann Group, edict egaming GmbH, celebrated its 25th anniversary. Founded in 1998, edict egaming was among the first online gambling operators. Since then, the company has grown from strength to strength, becoming a recognizable name within the gambling sector. Today, edict egaming is among the top aggregators for the sector, a testament to its resilience and unstoppable commitment to growing and expanding.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, approximately 100 guests gathered to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary. The anniversary ceremony took place at Hamburg’s Altona offering events such as a harbor tour and a dinner party. The anniversary helped bring together edict employees, long-term partners and friends, that were delighted to look back on the company's rich history.</p>
<p>In addition to being among the pioneers within the online gambling sector, edict accomplished many other goals throughout its rich history. Back in 2002, the company developed the first online casino system in Germany, powering casinos in Hamburg and Wiesbaden. Edict was also the first licensed gambling provider in the world to stream roulette games from a brick-and-mortar casino on the Internet.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, edict became a part of Gauselmann Group. The company continued to grow after that, releasing its Game Solution back in 2014. The innovative solution enabled integration options for a growing number of customers across the globe.</p>
<p>Dominic-Daniel Liénard, edict egaming's CEO, shared his excitement about the recent celebratory ceremony that was organized in Hamburg. "To celebrate this anniversary with so many of you who have been part of this journey is a very special moment for me," he said in a statement. Finally, Liénard pointed out: "Our 25th anniversary is not only a special opportunity to acknowledge our enduring presence in the market and our extensive network of reliable partners, but also to thank our employees who have made this success possible in the first place."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Merkur Casino GmbH, the leading casino operator that is a part of Gauselmann Group, strengthened its senior-level team by hiring Irina Ruf for the role of Managing Director International. Joining the C-suite at Merkur, she filled in the position of Stefan Bruns, who stepped into a new role with Gauselmann as a part of its Management Board.</p>
