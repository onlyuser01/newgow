    <h1>Alabama Casinos Dreams Curacao Resort Spa Casino Reno Casino Casinos New Mexico Saratoga Hotel And C</h1>

<p>I would suggest avoiding this casino as I had my accounts closed and all the funds stolen by the casino.</p>
<p>The problem was I had created 2 accounts which i did not do for any reason other than i thought the first account wasn't created correctly. I gained no advantage from having 2 accounts and indeed i believe had deposited more than I had withdrawn.</p>
<p>This is the email i received:</p>
