    <h1>Station Casinos Careers Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino Lucky Eagle Casino Eagle Pass Ballys Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello, the game crashed, which wasn't my fault, it was you and the supporters said everything was fine, which wasn't the case. I have played other games. If the game hadn't crashed and I was still getting money with the bonus I would be at 6000 bonus money so I would have wagered the bonus at 6000. But after that, when the bonus was there and I had made a withdrawal request, I wrote to support. And they said I still have to implement it, they had checked everything (a withdrawal request was still there). But after I bet a few 100 euros and asked the support again why I had the bonus, it was simply canceled.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>your supporters didn't do the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software problems with you I can't help it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nowhere does it say that if the game crashes (not the player's fault) the win will be voided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you make a withdrawal, you confirm the cancellation of the bonus by the player, not by you. Which I didn't do on my part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I canceled the payout on my own initiative without it being processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I either want my converted bonus paid out (2800) or cancel the bonus from (3600) as bonus money where, as your supporters said, I still had to convert 1000 euros.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I left all the money with you guys. What I was able to pay out. If your supporters had told me right from the start that the bonus could not be implemented, I would not have bothered them at all.</p>
<p>Casino guru. If you want the history I got it today. But if I hadn't asked for your help, I wouldn't have even gotten the answer from casinoly.</p>
<p>It was a software error with you, please also stand by it. I wouldn't have stopped the round otherwise.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
