    <h1>Zia Casino Deal Casino Beach Club Bellagio Hotel Casino Resort Grand Casino Shawnee Buffalo Casino G</h1>

<p>Rivalry Corp started out as a company fully dedicated to educating consumers about esports betting and introducing them to a bespoke esports betting experience - it has succeeded in achieving both. Today, Rivalry is one of the most successful endemic esports betting brands on the market, and this is undeniable.</p>
<p>However, the Toronto-listed company is hardly stopping there. It has taken its expertise in esports and brought it to other verticals, such as sports betting, media, technology, and now, casino, through the launch of the company’s dedicated Casino.exe, or its iGaming solution that will feature new games and the opportunity to engage in some of the best online casino titles.</p>
<p>The new platform comes with games such as Bomb Squad, Wheel of Time, Courier Sweeper, Penalty Shootout, combining together a mix of third-party games, but also Rivalry’s proprietary Rushlane and Aviator genre-defining games. Commenting on the launch of the new product, Rivalry Co-Founder and CEO Steven Salz said:</p>
<p>"Our technology and creative capabilities continue to drive meaningful opportunities across our business where we can innovate on product and ultimately reimagine the betting experience for a younger audience that craves interactive entertainment."</p>
<p>Salz spoke about the importance of the new product, arguing that the brand will be able to diversify its offer and ensure that Rivalry is less dependent on the seasonality of esports, a fair observation which points to the fact that esports betting interest ebbs and flows depending on the time of the year and available events.</p>
<p>Overall, Casino.exe should push profit margins up and let Rivalry’s own products in the iGaming vertical shine. In fact, Salz is already confident in the success of the new product as its Aviator crash-style game brought in 10% of the company’s revenue in the third quarter. Rivalry Senior Manager of Product Design David King chimed in and said that Rivalry has been able to consistently target a young audience whose average age is 25.</p>
<p>Thanks to Casino.exe, players have an entertaining virtual platform that allows them to access a number of excellent iGaming titles. The solution is particularly lightweight, allowing consumers to play from old PCs, retro operating systems, and so much more. Rivalry is not shying away from pushing on all fours as it seeks to increase its profitability by taking good lessons from one vertical and injecting them into another.</p>
