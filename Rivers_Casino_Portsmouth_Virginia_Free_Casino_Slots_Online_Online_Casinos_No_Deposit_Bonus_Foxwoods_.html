<p>Push Gaming’s Slot Brings Engaging Features and Mechanics</p>
<p>Amit Samji, Push Gaming’s head of studio, spoke about the fresh theme offered by the new Goat Getter slot. He highlighted that the game delivers engaging gameplay, packed with thrilling mechanics and features that make it stand out from the competition. “We’re sure this is one title that gets player’s goats in entirely the right fashion,” explained Samji in conclusion.</p>
<p>“Goat Getter’s theme is a breath of fresh, clean mountain air among the leprechauns and pyramids of today’s market.“ Amit Samji, head of studio at Push Gaming</p>
<p>Recently, Push Gaming announced a new deal with Betway. Through that partnership, the company expanded further its global footprint by agreeing to supply its full portfolio of games, powering Betway’s operations.</p>
<p>Here are some of the engaging features that Goat Getter players can expect. As a pay-anywhere slot, the game awards the players a prize whenever six or more matching symbols land anywhere on the gameboard. Once this happens, the winning symbols are removed, allowing for the popular cascade mechanic to be triggered and place new symbols in their place. This feature grants a chance for subsequent wins, elevating the excitement for the players even further.</p>
<p>Landing three bonus symbols grants players free spins. Granting a chance for further thrills, the game allows the players to gamble their free spins for more than initially awarded. “During this time, goat symbols can land and will go on to collect any instant cash prizes,” explains Push Gaming. Landing more goat symbols can help increase the player’s position on a ladder where five or more positions are needed to trigger a multiplier that can bring mouth-watering prizes.</p>
