    <h1>The Linq Casino Las Vegas Nevada Peppermill Resort Spa Casino Plaza Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Gun L</h1>

<p>I haven't been to the casino since December, I've been active again for about 2 weeks and have already made a deposit and also happened to read that my name was listed in the ranking list1, among the highest Mystery Mega Jackpot winners from November 18th, 2022 from the last tournament is. After some research, I found that I received an official SMS and email notification for November 18th, 2022 , but not personal profit sharing, but with the address to a Juser's... Casino player, the jackpot win was cracked, which is why I am in the I was still active at the time but couldn't notice it. All other email SMS publications even have abbreviated names of the winners. I also didn't have the jackpot winnings credited to my player account and played actively in Joo Casino until mid-December without noticing. Until I've been active on Joo again for 2 weeks and noticed my winnings and reported it to support staff. Shortly afterwards there was no concrete answer, but a request for screenshots of the transaction ID and personal details for verification, even though I've been verified since the beginning of 2022 and my player account is confirmed with green ticks. After several error messages and rejections, it was finally done. I then emailed support again and received this response,</p>
<p>Support: 'Your jackpot was added and played in the previous year'</p>
<p>I know exactly that this is not the case, I also checked the transaction list in my player account and there is no jackpot win listed in the history. I also have lots of screenshots as proof if they can help me.</p>
