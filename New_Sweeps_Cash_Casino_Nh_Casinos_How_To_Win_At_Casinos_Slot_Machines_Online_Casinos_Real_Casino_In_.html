    <h1>New Sweeps Cash Casino Nh Casinos How To Win At Casinos Slot Machines Online Casinos Real Casino In</h1>

<p>hi Daniel,the most hypocrite country in the whole world is the netherlands ..they should never ever had regulate the online casinos.really it is a farce .they picked a few criminals and gave them a license .most of them have more than 50 gamblng halls in the country and of course the lottery and the state casinos first went online .only one provider evolution gaming .we heard 20 years the goverment warn us not to play outside and that the games were not fair and the casinos were not supporting responsible gaming and who they give a license for?the same provider and games .the rtp is 31% down because the operators have to pay 30% tax .i tried all 10 casinos cost me 3000â‚¬ one month the biggest win was 30â‚¬ really if you talk about scam here is it.i closed all of them .the gambling board is vanished .you dont hear them anymore .no response if you file a complaint it takes 8 weeks .the oprators are rude .if you have negative critisisum they close your acount .the new regulation is set up to protect players from addiction but they kill you with casino promotions even trains are painted in casino colours .limits everywere .you are not playing but only clicking popups away about your limits and playtime .were malta casinos payed in seconds here you have to wait 5 days because the gouverment want to track every player .privacy is thrown out of the window .there is no freedom anymore .netherlands has killed online gambling for there own benefit (taxes)now i understand the goverments are not for the people .</p>
<p>i miss the malta casinos really very much .but unfortunatly every casino who will get a license will pay the 30% taxes .the rtp will be the same as regular casinos.</p>
<p>there are many complaints here .casino guru should open a dutch site to help the players ðŸ˜‚ i played 15 years at malta few problems but overall great experience and always got my money if i won .for me online is dead .i have 6 still month to go untill my bann is over .from then on only play in a real casino .after 15 years playing online you get disgust by all these online rules :verifications,waiting for the wins and the bugs in the games .and most of all evolution gaming disgusting manipulated tables i had more than 100 acounts cost me about 400000â‚¬ .</p>
