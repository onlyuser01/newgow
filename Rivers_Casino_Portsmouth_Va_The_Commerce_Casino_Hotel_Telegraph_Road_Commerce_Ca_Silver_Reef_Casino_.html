<p>The agreement with the Dambe league is Stake.com’s first sponsorship deal in Africa</p>
<p>The African Warriors Fighting Championship (AWFC), an African Dambe and wrestling organization, has found a mighty gambling ally. Thanks to a new agreement, the league has secured Stake.com’s backing.</p>
<p>Stake.com is the biggest crypto betting company and one of the biggest global online gambling companies. A fervent promoter of sports, Stake.com has an existing agreement with the UFC, one of the biggest combat sports leagues in the world.</p>
<p>The arrangement with the AWFC is notably Stake’s first Africa-facing sponsorship agreement. As a result of the deal, AWFC athletes will adopt the operator’s logo on their uniforms. In addition, the gambling company’s branding will be visible at AWFC’s fighting arenas. Finally, the league will promote Stake.com across its digital channels.</p>
<p>Dambe is a traditional Nigerian combat sport that has been quickly growing in popularity. The league’s founder and chief executive officer, Maxwell Kalu, hopes to modernize and popularize the sport, eventually bringing it to an international audience. The AWFC is also working hard on standardizing the Dambe rules and introducing important athlete safety standards.</p>
<p>AWFC Seeks to Promote Dambe</p>
<p>Mr Kalu commented on the current agreement with Stake.com, saying that the deal represents a major development for combat sports in Africa. He noted that his team is proud of the opportunity to further popularize Dambe, which he described as an “ancient, intense and steeped in tradition” sport that has no parallel anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>According to Kalu, the deal with Stake attests to the growth of the AWFC and highlights the potential of Dambe.</p>
<p>We’re proud to be Stake’s first partner in Africa and look forward to assisting the brand in raising awareness and expanding its user base across the Continent. Maxwell Kalu, founder &amp; CEO, AWFC</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stake.com’s director of acquisitions, Akhil Sarin, said:</p>
<p>AWFC is a young brand with exciting plans, and we see huge potential for the sport of Dambe. Akhil Sarin, director of acquisitions, Stake.com</p>
<p>Sarin added that his company remains committed to supporting combat sports through partnership agreements with sports leagues. The addition of the AWFC to Stake’s portfolio, according to him, is a “huge step forward” as his team continues its efforts to penetrate the African betting market.</p>
<p>In other news, Stake.com just secured a partnership agreement with Chelsea FC, further highlighting the operator’s desire to nurture professional sports. Earlier this year, the operator struck a deal with the Alfa Romeo F1 team, giving it a new identity.</p>
