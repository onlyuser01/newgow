<p>Honest Experience with Crypto Loko</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: They’re terrible!</p>
<p>The beginning of this story takes place when they sent me a bonus offer. Here is Exhibit A.</p>
<p>I understand these bonuses are virtually impossible to playthrough, but I enjoy the challenge. So I redeemed the coupon and went to town.</p>
<p>I normally don’t keep track of the play through since, it’s practically impossible, but I do periodically check the cashier and take a look at my progress. And there it was (Exhibit B)</p>
<p>I was playing for quite some time—from dusk until dawn. And I bet quite of lot on a handful of games.</p>
<p>I considered myself incredibly lucky to make it through the wagering requirements. (Keep this paragraph and Exhibit B in mind.)</p>
<p>And so, the next steps were to:</p>
<p>1.) Verify my identity</p>
<p>2.) Deposit money before I could withdraw; So I deposited $12.</p>
<p>3.) Then I’d withdraw $62 which included the max cash out of $50 and my initial deposit after $12. It was simple arithmetic (or so I thought).</p>
<p>I did all of these steps, but every time I tried to request a withdraw of $62.00 — it was declined.</p>
<p>Remember from earlier when I said to keep that paragraph and Exhibit B in mind?</p>
<p>Well, I thought the most obvious situation I was facing (after I kept getting declined) was that I didn’t meet the playthrough requirements. It’s normal to make it through even if a person played all night and day. It a lot of takes luck to accomplish that.</p>
<p>But Exhibit B displays there that is a playthrough balance of $0.00. So if it was an error on their part - someone could contact me and I would resume play with the $277.74.</p>
<p>After trying numerous times to request the $62.00, I finally requested the max I had earned because I figured it would cause a trigger and someone would finally have to look at my account.</p>
<p>You’ll now see Exhibit C below with the foul play that which was executed by a manager.</p>
<p>Exhibit C was taken just today as I was typing this, and the crookedness of the casino can’t be denied at this point. All websites who are tallying a blacklist for casinos online absolutely need to be aware of these scoundrels.</p>
<p>An explanation could’ve been offered through their customer service email, but let’s face it: These janky casinos are operated with no intent to provide any type of customer service to visitors. At this point, I wish they could be shut down but they are unregulated so they don’t care.</p>
<p>In the end, $50 isn’t what I’m actually upset about: I’m sending this so people are aware of this casino and to avoid it. Crypto Loko deserves this terrible reputation and they deserve to go under.</p>
