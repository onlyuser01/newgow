<p>Aryna Sabalenka vs. Qinwen Zheng is the final of the Women’s Singles tournament at the 2024 Australian Open. The match will take place on Saturday, January 27, and in this post, we’re going to show you who we think is going to win the trophy</p>
<p>Aryna Sabalenka is the defending Australian Open champion who’s been really impressive in 2024, winning all of her AO24 matches in straight sets. Now, she’s got one final obstacle to pass, which comes in the form of Qinwen Zheng.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese player hasn’t been as impressive as Sabalenka, you can be 100% certain that she’s going to give all she’s got on Saturday. But will this be enough to ruin Sabalenka’s plans?</p>

<p>Aryna Sabalenka Determined to Defend Her Title</p>
<p>Last year was very good for Aryna Sabalenka, mainly because she won her first-ever Grand Slam. It happened in Melbourne, where we saw her beat Elena Rybakina in the Final of the Australian Open.</p>
<p>She also reached the Final of the US Open the same year, as well as the semifinal stage of the French Open and Wimbledon. Now, she wants to make 2024 an even more successful year.</p>
<p>Aryna Sabalenka is the first woman to reach back to back singles finals at the Australian Open since Serena Williams.</p>

<p>If morning really shows the day, she’s bound to do well in the 2024 Australian Open WTA Final. Sabalenka has been nothing short of brilliant since coming to Melbourne, winning each of her five matches without losing a single set.</p>
<p>The longest she’s spent on the court in this tournament was 1 hour and 44 minutes against Coco Gauff in the semifinal. The reason for this is that their first set went to a tiebreaker, but after she won it, she went to win the second set by 6-4.</p>
<p>Can Qinwen Zheng Win Her First-Ever Major?</p>
<p>Zheng Qinwen is a Chinese player who’s just 21. She’s got plenty of time ahead of her to reach greatness, but she definitely wouldn’t mind winning the 2024 Australian Open.</p>
<p>This is the furthest she’s reached in a Grand Slam tournament, with her previous maximum being the quarterfinal phase of last year’s US Open.</p>
<p>Through to her first grand slam final!! 💪</p>
<p>Zheng Qinwen gets the win over Dayana Yastremska in straight sets and will face Aryna Sabalenka in the championship match! 🍿#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/3qFcalVctC — Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel) January 25, 2024</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, she probably isn’t on the level required to beat such an elite player as Sabalenka. After all, she’s got a very bad record against players from the WTA Top 10.</p>
<p>The highest-ranked player she’s defeated in her career was Paula Badosa. This happened in 2022, at the time when the Spanish player was sitting in the No. 4 position in the WTA Rankings. Now, she’s supposed to battle the WTA No. 2 for the Australian Open title.</p>
<p>Aryna Sabalenka vs. Qinwen Zheng Prediction</p>
<p>Qinwen Zheng is a rising star in women’s tennis, but the fact is that she’s had it easy so far at the 2024 Australian Open. For example, in the semifinal, she defeated the WTA No. 93 player, Dayana Yastremska.</p>
<p>Now, she’s supposed to play against one of the best female players of her generation. Obviously, we don’t think she’s going to do much.</p>
<p>Pick: Aryna Sabalenka</p>
