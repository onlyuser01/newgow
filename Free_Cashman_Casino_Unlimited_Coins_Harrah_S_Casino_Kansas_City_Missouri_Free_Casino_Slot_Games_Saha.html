<p>The Indianapolis Colts are hoping that with the help of their fans at Lucas Oil Stadium, they’re going to be able to end their four-game losing streak. For the Los Angeles Chargers, the main motivation to win the MNF game is to get one step closer to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Chargers have Their Eyes on the Playoffs</p>
<p>The Chargers are 8-6 on the season, and with three more games to go, their playoff future looks bright. Their chance of making the playoffs is 80% right now. If they beat the Colts, that number will go all the way to 98%. What this practically means is that they could book their playoff ticket even before the final week of the regular season.</p>
<p>So, the big question is can they win the Monday Night Football game? The answer is yes. That is, the Chargers certainly have the manpower needed to beat a mediocre opponent such as Indianapolis. They’re also in good shape right now with a 3-1 record in their last four.</p>
<p>The Bolts’ latest game was a win over the Tennessee Titans, a team that’s very tricky to beat in 2022. Brandon Staley’s men, however, managed to outsmart the Titans’ hard defense, eventually beating them 17-14.</p>
<p>Quarterback Justin Herbert didn’t have a great game (28/48 for 313 yards, no touchdowns, and two interceptions), but LA’s runners did their job marvelously. Running backs Austin Ekeler and Joshua Kelley were the ones to score the two touchdowns for the Chargers in that game.</p>
<p>Have the Indianapolis Colts Given Up?</p>
<p>The Colts are 4-9-1 in 2022, which means that they practically stand no chance of getting to the postseason. They did start the season well but then entered a horrible run with a 1-7 record since mid-October.</p>
<p>To make things even worse, last week they were on the losing end of the NFL’s biggest comeback. The Minnesota Vikings beat them 39-36 even though they had a 36-0 lead at halftime. After dropping such a lead, you got to feel bad. They probably don’t have the confidence nor the motivation necessary to upset the Chargers in the Monday Night Football game.</p>
<p>Sure, their fans at Lucas Oil Stadium will try to cheer them up, but we doubt they’re going to achieve much. In fact, the best they can hope for is to not get humiliated by the Chargers.</p>
<p>Chargers vs Colts Predictions</p>
<p>The Colts are 2-4 at home this season, but they didn’t get embarrassed in any of those games. In fact, they covered the spread in 50% of those games. This time, the spread is set to four points, but we doubt they’re going to cover it this time. Instead, we think the Chargers are going to beat them by at least one TD.</p>
<p>Picks: Los Angeles Chargers to win and cover the spread.</p>
