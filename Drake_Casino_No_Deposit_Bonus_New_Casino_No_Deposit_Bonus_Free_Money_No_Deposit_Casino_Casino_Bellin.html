<p>The Swedish Gaming Authority, Spelinspektionen, is the country's industry body tasked with the regulation of the legal gambling market. Its efforts ensure that the market is fair, safe and reliable for the customers. On Wednesday this week, the Authority confirmed plans to expand its senior-management team by bringing an expert with extensive experience.</p>
<p>Spelinspektionen said that it selected Kristina Geiger for the role of Head of Department for Operational Support. Joining the Authority's management team, she will oversee strategic processes and collaborate with senior-level members of Spelinspektionen.</p>
<p>In a statement released on June 14, 2023, Camilla Rosenberg, the Authority's Director General, was excited to see Geiger become a part of the regulator's senior management team. "We welcome Kristina to our team! With her, we get an experienced leader with the habit of driving change," said Rosenberg.</p>
<p>Geiger has extensive professional experience within different regulatory bodies. She was a part of the Karolinska Institutet, as well as the Government Office and the European Commission where she served as a national expert. Moreover, Geiger worked for the Norwegian State Museums of History as a Financial Manager. Her professional background includes a role with the Swedish Competition Authority too.</p>
<p>Sharing her excitement, Geiger pointed out: "I am looking forward to starting at the Gambling Inspectorate in view of the authority's important mission and having been trusted to lead the department for operational support." According to Spelinspektionen, its new Head of Department for Operational support will start in her role effective from August 7, 2023.</p>
<p>The recent senior-level appointment comes ahead of planned changes for the market in the country. New rules coming into effect in July, require providers of services and solutions within the gambling vertical to secure a license from the Swedish Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>Although the change sounds like a formality it seeks to boost the channelization to the regulated gambling market in the country. At the same time, with the change, Spelinspektionen seeks to ensure that gambling operators that have a license in the country leverage technology and solutions from licensed providers, thus strengthening the overall trust and reliability in the sector.</p>
<p>Given the upcoming changes, iGaming technology providers started to secure licenses to ensure their compliance. Late last month, the popular provider of online gambling content, Spinomenal, confirmed it secured a B2B supplier's permit from the gambling regulator.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in May, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), the leading provider of solutions and products for the online and retail gambling industry, confirmed it also secured a license from the Swedish Gaming Authority.</p>
