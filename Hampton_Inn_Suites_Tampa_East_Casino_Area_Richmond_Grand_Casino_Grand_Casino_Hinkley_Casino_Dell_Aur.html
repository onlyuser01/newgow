<p>The odds come from CG Technology, the sports betting operator responsible for mobile wagering in several legalized markets, as well as land-based casinos in Nevada including The Venetian and Palazzo, Palms, Tropicana, and Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>New England’s over/under of 11 wins should come as little surprise – the team won exactly that number a year ago on the way to winning their third Super Bowl in five years. The Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, and last year’s Super Bowl runners-up Los Angeles Rams follow closely at 10.5 wins.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Chargers round out the top five at 10 games. The Arizona Cardinals and Miami Dolphins have the lowest win total, both at five games.</p>
<p>The over/under totals could change depending on the outcome of the NFL Draft, which kicks off on April 25.</p>
<p>Oklahoma quarterback and 2018 Heisman winner Kyler Murray is the strong favorite to go first, with his odds at -1600 (implied chance of 94.12 percent). Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa is next at +300. The Arizona Cardinals have the No. 1 selection.</p>
<p>Browns Nosers</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the 2018 season, CG Technology put the Cleveland Browns’ win total at six games for next season. Following an impressive offseason that brings superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Dog Pound, the sportsbook has increased that number to nine – tied for the 10th most wins in the entire league.</p>
<p>Following two years where Cleveland went 1-31, the Browns bounced back in 2018 with rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield. The team traded for star WR Jarvis Landry, and built a strong defense around DE Myles Garrett.</p>
<p>Excitement is abundant in Ohio regarding the Browns for the first time in more than a decade. But ESPN NFL analyst Louis Riddick says hype doesn’t assure success.</p>
<p>It’s great for Cleveland. It’s great for their hopes to have now shifted expectations, but with expectations comes opponents that are now going to be a little more ticked off and aren’t going to overlook you,” Riddick stated. “You still have to go out on the football field and perform.”</p>
<p>The Browns are the favorites to win the AFC North, the Westgate SuperBook listing them at +140 (implied odds 41.67 percent).</p>
<p>Super Bowl Odds</p>
<p>The Pats and Chiefs remain the Super Bowl favorites at 6/1. The Saints and Rams are next at 8/1, and then it’s the Browns and Green Bay Packers at 14/1.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Chargers, Chicago Bears, and Indianapolis Colts round out the frontrunners at 16/1.</p>
<p>As for the longshots, no team has worse odds of winning Super Bowl 54 than the Dolphins. The SuperBook has the team at +15000, meaning a $100 wager and a Miami Vince Lombardi Trophy grab in 2020 returns a $15,000 net profit.</p>
