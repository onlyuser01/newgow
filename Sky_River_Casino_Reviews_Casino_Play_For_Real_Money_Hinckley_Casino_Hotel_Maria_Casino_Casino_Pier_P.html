<p>Canelo Alvarez and Callum Smith will fight for a vacant WBC title on Saturday, December 19, with Alvarez looking to change division one more time and add the first loss to Smith’s career.</p>
<p>Alvarez Drops Down a Division to Challenge Smith</p>
<p>Saul “Canelo” Alvarez and Callum Smith may not have been able to return to the ring in 2020, but the year will end with a boxing bang as the two will face off in a head-to-head fight on Saturday, December 19 at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Alvarez, who is taking on every challenge in boxing he can think of, will go down a division to now fight for the vacant WBC title. Both fighters have a lot to offer, with Canelo clocking an impressive 53-1-2 in his career, securing 36 KOs and Smith going undefeated at 27-0 at 19 KOs.</p>
<p>Where and How to Watch Canelo vs Smith?</p>
<p>DAZN remains the go-to option for all boxing events, offering extensive coverage and device support. A single-month subscription to the platform in the United States costs $19.99 compared to CAD$20 in Canada, and a free 30-day trial for Canadian sports fans.</p>
<p>A subscription to DAZN makes a lot of sense because you will also be able to see the fight between Gennadiy “GGG” Golovkin and Kamil Szeremeta adding to a worthwhile end-of-year sub to the streaming service.</p>
<p>Another benefit of DAZN is that you can stream it from a number of devices, including mobile platforms, smart TVs, and consoles.</p>

<p>Alvarez versus Smith: Absentees in 2020</p>
<p>Alvarez’s goal is clearly set as he will try to dethrone Smith whose spotless record is a worthwhile challenge for any fighter. Both fighters only fought in 2019 before taking a sabbatical for the better part of 2020.</p>
<p>In his last bout, Alvarez captured the WBO light-heavyweight title in Las Vegas against Sergey Kovalev on November 2, 2019. Meanwhile, Smith took on John Ryder in Liverpool, the United Kingdom, and defended his title on November 23 in 2019.</p>
<p>While the fighters have not been present in the boxing world throughout the past 12 months, both have been training hard.</p>
<p>Callum will have to do his best to defend his title against an opponent who has clocked as much mileage and traditionally fights in a heavier division. Meanwhile, Alvarez will settle for nothing less than defeating the promising WBC prospect.</p>
<p>Canelo Alvarez Overview</p>
<p>Age: 30</p>
<p>Height: 5’8″</p>
<p>Reach: 70.5″</p>
<p>Record: 53-1-2</p>
<p>KOs: 36</p>
<p>Callum Smith Overview</p>
<p>Age: 30</p>
<p>Height: 6’3″</p>
<p>Reach: 78″</p>
<p>Record: 27-0</p>
<p>KOs: 19</p>
<p>Odds for Canelo Alvarez vs Callum Smith</p>
<p>Smith Callum is posted as the heavy underdog for this one at (+460) and not too surprising given Canelo’s overall record in boxing is well-established and subject to admiration. Alvarez is posted at (-600) an overwhelming advantage owing to his titles across four divisions.</p>
<p>Going down a notch would not be a first for Canelo who has taken on opponents from all spectrums, so why would the No. 1-ranked super middleweight and WBA champion be any different?</p>
<p>Smith is no ordinary fighter either way. He is the same age as Alvarez and closes in on a good number of fights without suffering a defeat. He has taken on numerous opponents with a respectable track record of their own and has put a stop to their own climb to the top.</p>
<p>Before stopping Ryder, Smith fought with 37-2 Hassan N’Dam N’Jikam at Madison Square Garden, New York, securing a TKO victory. He is capable of outlasting opponents and has won a lot by UD and points.</p>
<p>Yet, Alvarez is a boxer who has been clocking in TKOs in the majority of his recent bouts and is vastly considered the more convincing fighter in the ring. When Alvarez changes division, it’s usually to win a title or take on a big contender, so Smith will have to be extra careful.</p>
