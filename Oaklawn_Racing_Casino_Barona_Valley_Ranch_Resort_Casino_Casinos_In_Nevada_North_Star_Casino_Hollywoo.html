<p>Vivo Gaming has launched a new Promotional Tournament Tool that has been designed to increase engagement and retention for partners</p>
<p>The tool is seen as a major opportunity to significantly boost collaboration with operators and brands, and it has already debuted successfully with LatSoft. Operators will be able to create their own in-game tournaments and feature them across a number of sites all at once, increasing player engagement as they do.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming’s Tool Leads to Increased Retention and Engagement</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming also has the hard numbers to back its claims, arguing that the tool leads to a 65% increase in daily active players and an 82% overall increase in the daily number of rounds that have been played. The Promotional Tool comes with boosters and it offers a detailed breakdown of everything that players would need to know, including where they rank in the overall leaderboard and more.</p>
<p>The solution is built to first help with Vivo Gaming’s premium roulette title, but it will be extended to the company’s baccarat and blackjack products. Vivo Gaming CCO Neil Howells was very optimistic about the arrival of this new product and said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled with how our Promotional Tournament Tool has performed so far and the feedback from our operator partners has been phenomenal. What’s more, we are absolutely delighted to have diversified our award-winning offering with such an innovative and engaging product as this. Vivo Gaming CCO Neil Howells</p>
<p>The opportunity was similarly welcomed by LatSoft director of marketing Damian Ramirez who hailed the arrival of Vivo Gaming’s Promotional Tournament Tool as a great way to increase retention for the company’s brands. Ramirez argued that any operator that is looking to increase their performance may want to take a closer look at Vivo Gaming’s solution.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming is looking to spearhead strong expansion in 2023, following a very strong 2022 for the company. The Promotional Tournament Tool is a step in the right direction.</p>
