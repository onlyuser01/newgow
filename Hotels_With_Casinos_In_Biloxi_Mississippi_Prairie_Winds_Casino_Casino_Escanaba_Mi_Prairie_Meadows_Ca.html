    <h1>Hotels With Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Prairie Winds Casino Casino Escanaba Mi Prairie Meadows Ca</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your reply. I normally don't like to complain but I was really let down by the casino, and I've invested a lot of time and money on this online casino, because it is a favorite pastime of mine. Anyway, it is not my first time playing or receiving money. In my initial complaint, I did mention that it does take the casino a few weeks to send the payment, so that has always been fully understood. It usually will take the casino 7 days to approve my request and then payment usually hits my account within 7 days or less. I have been playing for quite some time now and I have received payments from Lucky Tiger in the past. On January 21st, I requested a withdrawal of $237. It was approved by the casino via email confirmation on February 1st. I received a partial payment of $222 on February 4th.</p>
<p>On January 26th, I requested a withdrawal of $262. It was approved by the casino via email confirmation on February 4th. As soon as I received that confirmation and my funds exited my Lucky Tiger bank, I requested another withdrawal in the amount of $203 on February 2nd. It was approved by the casino via email confirmation on February 11th. On February 17th, I received two separate payments from the casino ($105 + $188 totaling $293). I made one last request on February 4th, and $120 was approved by the casino via email confirmation on February 15th (that is, 11 business days excluding weekends and a holiday). To date, I have only received the payments described above (a total of $515). The 4 approved withdrawals amount to a total of $822, so I am still owed $307, reason I contacted Lucky Tiger. I did chat with a representative yesterday at the Casino who confirmed that the casino had decided to send me what they sent me. I asked if I had violated any of their terms to not receive my money after they approved everything, and she told me that it has nothing to do with violating any terms. Simply, that the casino reserves the right to send different amounts when feasible to them (without a true explanation as to why). I hope this response answers your question, and again thank you for taking the time to investigate my complaint. If I can elaborate further, please do not hesitate to contact me again.</p>
