<p>SKS365’s Planetwin365 will now boast a live streaming service that features various live events, including the NBA, Bundesliga, tennis, Italian Serie C, and Copa Libertadores</p>
<p>SKS365 and Sportradar have recently forged a long-term agreement to enhance the betting experience on Planetwin365 by offering a complete entertainment package. This new service will be available to registered users online and on mobile devices and also across the company’s retail network, which is part of the group’s omnichannel approach.</p>
<p>The New Sportradar Partnership Enables Unprecedented Live Sports Experience</p>
<p>The new partnership means that through the self-terminals, each customer will be able to select and enjoy their preferred live sports events without the need for assistance.</p>
<p>The platform now covers approximately 8,000 football events annually, which includes not only the Bundesliga and Italian Serie C but also the Champions League qualifiers, Copa del Rey, and Spanish Super Cup, as well as competitions from all over the world that are not available on traditional TV channels.</p>
<p>These competitions include the Austrian and Swiss championships, the main South American tournaments, Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana, Recopa, and national team matches for women’s football.</p>
<p>Moreover, Planetwin365 will offer live coverage of over 20,000 ITF tennis events annually, while basketball will feature 13,000 events yearly, including the NBA, Chinese, and the primary European League competitions.</p>
<p>Other sports that will be now available on the live-streaming service include volleyball, hockey, and additional tennis matches. With such a vast selection of events, Planetwin365 guarantees an exciting and enjoyable betting experience for sports enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
<p>SKS365 Will Continue to Follow Their Successful Omnichannel Strategy</p>
<p>Stefan Debus, senior director of audiovisual global commercial at Sportradar, stated that the new agreement with SKS365 would enable Planetwin365 to create an immersive betting experience for both existing and new customers. The addition of Sportradar’s streamed content on their website and mobile app would provide a complete entertainment package, keeping customers engaged for an extended period.</p>
<p>The streaming service would also allow each shop to customize its content, ensuring a personalized service that meets its unique customer needs. Additionally, the service would enable customers to make informed betting choices as sporting events unfold.</p>
<p>According to Troy Cox, SKS365’s chief commercial officer, the gaming experience is incomplete without the ability to watch live sporting events. Cox also mentioned that the recent agreement allows SKS365 to offer their players a fully integrated entertainment package, comprising over 40,000 live events annually, to cater to the needs of all customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an initial analysis of the service revealed a positive impact on their business. Consequently, they are developing innovative technologies to enhance the gaming experience and follow their omnichannel strategy.</p>
