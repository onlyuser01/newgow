<p>Pariplay has strengthened its foothold in New Jersey by inking an agreement with Resorts Digital Gaming</p>
<p>Already a popular presence in four US states and seven Canadian provinces, NeoGames’ subsidiary has expanded its reach in the Garden State. Thanks to the new deal, the brand will dig deeper into the North American regulated gaming market and continue the “outstanding strides” made in 2022 in the region.</p>
<p>NeoGames Adds “Another Strong Casino Brand” to Its Roster of Partners</p>
<p>The announcement made by the technology-driven supplier of iLottery and online gaming solutions was discussed by president Tsachi Maimon. Maimon expressed NeoGames’ delight to be adding “another strong casino brand” to their list of prestigious partners.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that 2022 brought success to the company and pointed out that throughout the year, it launched its leading content with new brands. The new partnership is expected to help the leading provider of iLottery solutions and services continue its strategic growth and expansion.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gaming’s chief executive officer, Ed Andrewes, explained that Pariplay’s Fusion platform mixes highly “innovative and exciting games” from a large number of top suppliers, including Wizard Games. Andrewes express their excitement to be allowed these offerings to their players.</p>
<p>The Fusion platform offers a unified and unique approach to delivering quality content via an offering comprised of more than 14,000 games created by over 80 studios. The same aggregation solution focuses on fueling gaming operators with better Return on Investment rates and higher levels of efficiency.</p>
<p>What Can Be Expected from the New Deal?</p>
<p>Resorts Casino and Hotel’s online division customers will get access to highly praised games such as Wolf Riches and Spirit of Mustang, along with aggregated content belonging to some of the most reputable and successful gaming providers on the planet.</p>
<p>The content is part of an impressive collection of proprietary as well as third-party gaming titles that New Jersey players are prone to appreciate. After announcing that it had secured certification from the World Lottery Association at the start of the year, NeoGames inked an agreement with Pollard Banknote, giving both companies the necessary flexibility to reap the benefits of a number of lottery opportunities either as partners or individually.</p>
<p>The fresh joint venture agreement is set to strengthen the ongoing success of NeoPollard Interactive and its customers while offering both Pollard Banknote and NeoGames the chance to take their expansion on the regulated North American market a few steps forward.</p>
