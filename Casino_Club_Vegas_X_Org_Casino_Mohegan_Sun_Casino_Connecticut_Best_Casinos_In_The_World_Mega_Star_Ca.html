<p>PointsBet Launches Its Services for Customers in Virginia</p>
<p>Premier global online gaming operator PointsBet announced on Wednesday that it launched its services in Virginia. The operator launched its market-leading mobile app as well as its digital sports betting product for sports fans in The Old Dominion.</p>
<p>The recent launch marks the eighth state where PointsBet’s leading product is live. Before Virginia, the operator has launched its services for customers in key markets such as Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Only recently, PointsBet and Colonial Downs racetrack received an official supplier license for sports wagering in the state issued by the Virginia Lottery. This made Colonial Downs the only licensed gaming company that is currently operating and headquartered in Virginia. Colonial Downs is a subsidiary of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment and currently operates multiple properties in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Company to Benefit from TV Exposure, Launches Special Offer</p>
<p>Considering that PointsBet is an official, exclusive sports betting partner of NBC Sports, the operator would be able to leverage the media’s digital assets to promote its brand in Virginia. The company has already appeared within NBC Sports Regional Networks such as NBC Sports Washington. Moreover, PointsBet appears regularly via Washington Football Team, Wizards and Capitals programming.</p>
<p>Celebrating the launch in Virginia, PointsBet announced a special “Bet &amp; Get” offer. The exclusive offer enables users to earn 10% from their cumulative wagers in Free Bets this month. Overall, there will be five user tiers depending on the cumulative wagers with each higher tier granting the user a higher Free Bet. The operator explained that whenever a user hits a new tier, they can expect their credits within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Launch Brings Excitement for PointsBet and Colonial Downs</p>
<p>PointsBet USA’s CEO, Johnny Aitken, revealed the company is thrilled to launch its services in partnership with Colonial Downs. He added that PointsBet brings its leading market technology to the passionate sports fans in Virginia. In conclusion, Aitken said that thanks to the launch, sports fans can now access the fastest online betting platform which grants them robust in-play capabilities.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be launching in Virginia with our partner Colonial Downs, now bringing our best-in-market technology to such a passionate sports community.” Johnny Aitken, CEO at PointsBet USA</p>
<p>Aaron Gomes, chief operating officer at Colonial Downs Group added that the company is proud to join forces with PointsBet. He acknowledged that as a premier sports betting platform, PointsBet is among the most successful operators in the US. “We are pleased to help bring this gaming option to our loyal customers and other gamers in Virginia,” said Gomes in conclusion.</p>
