<p>The Chiefs Looking for Their Sixth Straight Win</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs have all wins since Week 6 when they lost to the Buffalo Bills at home. Since that loss, we saw them beat the following five teams:</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers 44-20 on the road</p>
<p>Tennessee Titans 20-17 at home (in overtime after 17-17 in regulation)</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars 27-17 at home</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers 30-27 on the road</p>
<p>Los Angeles Rams 26-10</p>
<p>As you can see, their offense has been brilliant lately, scoring 20+ points in each of those five games. That’s not surprising knowing that they have Patrick Mahomes as their quarterback and tight end Travis Kelce as his favorite target.</p>
<p>What is kind of surprising is that the Chiefs have been very good defensively as well. This goes especially knowing that they’ve faced some teams that are really good in the offense. Truth be told, the best offense they played against is Buffalo, who ended up beating them 24-20. This Sunday, they’re taking on the team that’s fifth in the league in terms of points per game (PPG). Is there a reason for concern in Kansas’ locker room?</p>
<p>Cincinnati’s Defense in the Spotlight</p>
<p>With a 25.9 PPG, the Bengals are a Top 5 offense. No surprise there when joe Burrow is playing fantastic football. The QB has thrown for at least one touchdown in every single game he’s played so far in 2022. He’s also scored a couple of rushing TDs on his own.</p>
<p>Speaking of rushing, the Bengals’ leading running back Joe Mixon is expected to return to action after missing last weekend’s game due to a concussion. The same could be the case with wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase who’s recovering from a hip injury.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s almost 100% certain that the Bengals are going to score a couple of TDs on Sunday. That said, the offense isn’t what should worry them; it’s the defense. Stopping the mighty Chiefs from crossing the ball over the goal line too many times is key to victory in Week 13.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the Chiefs are the best offense in the league with a PPG of 29.6. The good news for the Bengals is that most of Kansas’ points came from passing action. Why is this such good news? Because Cincinnati’s defense is third in opponent passing TDs per game.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>This is a must-watch game for every NFL fan. The Chiefs vs Bengals game in Week 13 has the potential to be an instant classic. Knowing how good these two are offensively, we expect to see plenty of points on both ends. But which team will score more?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers say the Chiefs, we say the Bengals. We believe that the return of Mixon and Chase is going to be a game-changing factor.</p>
<p>Picks: Cincinnati Bengals to win; over to hit</p>
