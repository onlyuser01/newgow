<p>EveryMatrix’s business-to-business sportsbook division, OddsMatrix, has launched Fast Markets just in time for the upcoming soccer season. As a result, its partnering operators will be able to engage fans with exciting real-time markets for their favorite game.</p>
<p>The newly-launched product will encompass a variety of in-game, time-driven betting options. The Fast Markets will thus provide an important revenue stream for sports betting companies.</p>
<p>Thanks to OddsMatrix’s Fast Markets, bookmakers will be able to provide a plethora of betting options across fixed time ranges from 5, 10 and 15 minutes and rolling 5-minute ranges. Customers will be able to wager on specific markets, such as whether a goal will be scored within a specific time range.</p>
<p>At first, OddsMatrix’s new products will only cover soccer markets. In the near future, the provider will also roll out Fast Markets for other sports, such as basketball, tennis and other big sports leagues.</p>
<p>The launch of the OddsMatrix Fast Markets comes amid a high demand for micro betting. Micro bets are exceedingly popular among fans and are considered to be a key driver to boosting player activity and revenue. Micro betting products cater to the needs of dynamic players who desire quick gratification.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Wanted to Stay Ahead of Its Competitors</p>
<p>OddsMatrix’s chief executive officer, Tor Skeie, commented on the launch of the Fast Markets, highlighting the importance of such products. He explained that such products have skyrocketed in popularity, making them an important selling point for operators.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix wanted to remain ahead of the curve and, as a result, decided to launch its own micro betting products.</p>
<p>Skeie confirmed that his team plans to roll out more micro betting products for many other sports:</p>
<p>Fast Markets offers the real-time continuous betting opportunities of iGaming but with the skill of sports betting and we plan to build more betting options across many more sports in the coming months, particularly for U.S sports where tier-1 brands have already experienced significant increases in betting volumes as a result of micro betting. Tor Skeie, CEO, OddsMatrix</p>
<p>EveryMatrix is a leading provider of iGaming and sports betting software, content and products. The company supplies hundreds of companies with content, including world-leading operators. It fields a team of around 750 employees across 12 countries.</p>
<p>The company’s slots division, SlotMatrix, just signed a deal with Livespins, a social casino product. Prior to that, EveryMatrix expanded in the USA thanks to an agreement with WynnBet.</p>
