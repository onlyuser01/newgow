<p>Space Spins review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Space Spins blasts you out towards the final frontier behind the controls of an interstellar craft bound for a distant planet. Up there, you’ll encounter stunning celestial objects, dangerous enemy ships, and a healthy dose of the purple-blue void.</p>
<p>There are plenty of space based slots to pick from, but what makes Space Spins’s version stand out is the attention to detail.</p>
<p>The art style is in the standard Wazdan psychedelic range, with the space objects being rendered as highly geometric shapes in bright distinct colours. This makes for a space adventure with overtones of 70s sci-fi that should please any nostalgics out there.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics in Space Spins are excellent. From the gorgeous backdrop of planets and stars to the individual symbols, which are all drawn in a similar style, yet come across as clear and completely distinct from one another.</p>
<p>This is accompanied by small but effective animations that are given great impact by their synchronised win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>These sounds, in turn, blend well with the soft whale-song like new age track that gives the player a real sense of floating in zero g with its rise and fall of twinkling chords.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Space Spins is a six reel slot with four rows and 40 win lines.</p>
<p>The base game uses a Space Pile Feature. This results in a symbol – randomly selected before every spin – being stacked on a randomised set of reels. All symbols can be selected, except for the Scatter.</p>
<p>Space Pile feature selects a symbol randomly before every spin</p>
<p>As with most Wazdan games, the makers have put some effort into trying to make the gameplay fit the theme. In particular, the double or nothing gamble game requires you to decide if lasers or missiles will be more effective against an opponent in place of the standard "what colour card is next?" games that proliferate in the slot world.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatters anywhere on the reels triggers a Free Spin bonus. Three scatters gets the player 10 free spins, four gets 15, five gets 20, and six gets the maximum of 25 free spins. Free spins cannot be retriggered.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins, the Space Pile feature is activated for all spins, but the symbol is selected before the first spin and remains the same until the Free Spins are finished.</p>
<p>Hit the STOP button for the Spin Pile symbol selection</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.66%, well over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€90.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Space Spins slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is set by clicking a button, which switches the frequency of the symbols to ensure either low, medium or high volatility. Our preferred slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, so we recommend players go for the highest volatility level.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its sharp graphics and clever game design, Space Spins is off to a good start with its first impressions.</p>
<p>That it follows these impressions up with solid gameplay and a decent RTP (96.66%) makes this reviewer happy. That it further allows the option of setting the volatility pleases us even further.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great little slot that we can strongly recommend.</p>
