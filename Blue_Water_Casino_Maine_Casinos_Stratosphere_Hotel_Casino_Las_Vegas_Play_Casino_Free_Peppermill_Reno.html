<p>May is over and casinos in Pennsylvania have been able to muster the latest numbers which have confirmed the downward trend the Keystone State has experienced for a while now. Following an all-time high posted in March, Pennsylvania’s casinos have been slipping on the results.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Casinos Results Slide Further</p>
<p>Revenue for the month of May this year stood at $447.7 million based on data revealed by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. This constitutes a $13.8 million drop compared to April when the revenue stood at $461.6 million. The revenue was also down on the March results when casinos managed to notch up $462.7 million, which is the highest on record since the PGCB started tracking revenue.</p>
<p>But despite the overall decline and downward trend since March, results for May were actually higher by 8% year-over-year. In comparison, casinos in May 2021 collected only $413.1 million in revenue, so casinos have been largely able to pick up the pace once again and make things work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legal gambling and fantasy contests on sports led to an additional $181.6 million in tax revenue which was directed to Pennsylvania’s state coffers. A total of 16 licensees operate in Pennsylvania today and they have been contributing to the state by generating a hefty tax penny.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino saw the biggest increase in revenue over the period, with $62.8 million. Meanwhile, Rivers Casino Pittsburgh’s revenue hit $31.5 million. Hollywood Casino based at the Meadows in Washington County managed to generate another $23.5 million.</p>
<p>Retail Gambling Remains Strong</p>
<p>Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin posted just $2 million, mostly generated from slot machines with $137,376 coming from table games. Then, Live! Casino Pittsburgh climbed up to $9.5 million, once again with slots being the biggest drivers of revenue. Interestingly, retail still remained king in Pennsylvania in May.</p>
<p>A total of $205.6 million was generated from retail slot gaming compared to $78.2 million for online slots. Some $88.5 million came in from retail table games compared to $32.2 million from online gambling tables. Online poker was once again the laggard with just $2.8 million generated from the vertical.</p>
<p>Overall retail has remained the dominant segment despite huge interest in the online vertical. When all is said and done, though, foot traffic in casinos continues to be a guiding principle for many.</p>
