<p>Gaming Corps has made another stride in the Georgian iGaming market with the Swedish studio and developer of online casino content signing up a new partnership with Ambassadoribet under the terms of which it will provide the latter with a selection of high-performing and player-favorite titles.</p>
<p>The partnership sets out as an ambitious take on the local market that will allow both respective brands to rapidly deploy and strengthen their products with audiences, drive differentiation, and seek to become better-established names in the country.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps is able to provide serious content across the board for its partner, featuring all sorts of fresh experiences, including Crash, Mine, Table, and of course – Slots. Among the popular choices that have set the studio apart over the years are games such as Lobster Hotspot, Wild Woof, Raging Zeus Mine, Super Hot Stacks, and many other titles that are being developed in-house to deliver an impeccable experience.</p>
<p>Ambassadoribet COO Giorgi Gogua has welcomed the opportunity to strengthen the supplier’s portfolio with yet another distinct game that adds to the experience and builds engrossing and player-driven gameplay.</p>
<p>"With a range of game types on offer, and a constant stream of new releases, our players will have plenty of compelling options to choose from which we are very eager to present to them," Gogua explained, adding that the collaboration is set up to be future-proof and to see the companies work together for many years on end.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Director of Sales Mats Lundin was similarly happy with the opportunity and said that "Ambassadoribet is a promising start-up online casino." Lundin explained that Gaming Corps is a company that has repeatedly and continuously invested in strengthening its portfolio through product development.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been steadily growing its footprint in various markets across Europe of late. The company signed up a partnership with Brazino777 to solidify its presence in Belarus, and the supplier similarly teamed up with Alea to give itself another boost and make sure the studio reaches more potential partner operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>The supplier similarly embarked on an expansion journey in Africa with Betway late last year, reaffirming its ambitions as a global provider of gaming and entertainment products.</p>
