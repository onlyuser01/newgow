    <h1>Las Vegas Resort Casino Paris Hotel And Casino Okc Casinos Casinos Massachusetts Black Hawk Colorado</h1>

<p>Hello Tomas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick answer, I have already deposited 500 euros at the casino several times, the first 2000 euros or so were on it right away, but with the fifth deposit it was suddenly not on it, the 500 euros went from my account but were not on the casino account on it, I called the bank They said the money should have been on it long ago, since the other payments on the same day were also on it maybe it will take until tomorrow but unlikely the casino would like a PDF document saying that the payment failed they do not accept any Screenshot, but on the screenshot you can clearly see the transfer of the 500 euros to exactly the same recipient as the payments, I think the casino keeps the 500 euros that's not possible, I'll send you the screenshots to your email address, please write to the casino that the 500 euros are gone from my account and there was no error message from the bank it must be on them because the casino only ever answers me you want a PDF document with screenshots of all the receipts you can see mine Deposits that go from the bank account and you can see on the casino that a deposit was canceled but it was still deducted from my account.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
