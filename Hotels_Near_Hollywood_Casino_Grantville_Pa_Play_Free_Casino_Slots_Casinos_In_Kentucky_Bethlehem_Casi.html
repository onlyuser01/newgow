<p>SBEA+ 2023 is now a week away from the official rollout date. The event, which will reunite some of the most prominent sports betting experts in East Africa, is due on July 13-14 2023 at Kabira Country Club in Kampala, Uganda.</p>
<p>The industry gathering features 30 prominent speakers who have a strong and unique insight into the East African betting market, allowing SBEA+ delegates to benefit from the expertise of established industry leaders, among whom are Alessandro Pizzolotto, Co-founder and CEO at STM Gaming, Jeremiah Maango, CEO at iGamingAfrica.com, Jean Claude Mushimire, Executive Director at Rwanda Gaming Association, and others.</p>
<p>SBEA+ 2023 allows participants and delegates to exchange know-how and touch on key topics that will very well shape the future of the industry in the region. Among those are how Africa and Europe are different and what unique strategies need to be leveraged to be successful in the former.</p>
<p>Another topic will have to do with how to creatively expand and adapt businesses to the African landscape. A third topic still will have to do with Esportsâ€™ rising popularity in East Africa, along with cryptocurrency and mobile gaming. Among the things to see, hear, and do, delegates will have the opportunity to similarly check out the latest solution by NOVOGAMES Uganda Limited, a subsidiary of NOVOMATIC AG Austria.</p>
<p>The event itself has been celebrated by Dive Marketing Limited Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Muindi, among other industry specialists, who said:</p>
<p>"It is important for industry stakeholders to often meet and discuss emerging issues and best practices so as to maximize the positive impact of the industry on the continent."</p>
<p>To make sure that you attend and do not miss, parties and individuals interested in attendees can secure their passes before midnight at the official website of the event. A ticket may be bought by midnight on Friday, July 7.</p>
<p>SBEA is just one of a host of events organized by Eventus International this year with the main goal of ensuring that local experts and businesses exchange know-how, establish new rapports, and pursue growth opportunities owing to their collective knowledge.</p>
