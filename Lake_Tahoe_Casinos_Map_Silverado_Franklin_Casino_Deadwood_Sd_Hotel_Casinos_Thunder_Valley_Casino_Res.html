    <h1>Lake Tahoe Casinos Map Silverado Franklin Casino Deadwood Sd Hotel Casinos Thunder Valley Casino Res</h1>

<p>Dear Kevin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"4.9 Unless specified otherwise, the minimum withdrawal amount that applies for all payment methods, except bank transfer is $100. As for bank transfer, the minimum withdrawal amount is $350. There is no limit for how much a player can withdraw, but there is a predetermined limit set in place to every transaction which should not exceed $5,000. Amounts up to a maximum of $10,000 will be processed every 10 business days</p>
<p>4.13 Your withdrawal might be the subject of an internal audit at any given point. This is done in order to protect both the players as well as the Casino from fraudulent behavior. During the course of the audit which can take up to 7 business days for amounts equal to or exceeding $5,000, transaction records, gameplay and logs will be carefully vetted in relation to your withdrawal. Your withdrawal and all bonus funds can be rejected if you are found engaging in unlawful activities, collusion with other players or any other type of malicious behavior aimed at defrauding or cheating the Casino."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot help you in this case, because withdrawal limits are managed by the casino and we don’t have competency to change them. I can only recommend you to be patient. I’m sorry we couldn’t help you to resolve this situation, but, please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. Please let me know if there is any additional information to support your case, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
