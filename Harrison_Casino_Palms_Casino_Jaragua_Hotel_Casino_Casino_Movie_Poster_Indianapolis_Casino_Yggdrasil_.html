    <h1>Harrison Casino Palms Casino Jaragua Hotel Casino Casino Movie Poster Indianapolis Casino Yggdrasil</h1>

<p>Casino gaming content provider that stands for world-class entertainment, breaths innovation, and pushes boundaries Yggdrasil has joined forces with experienced game design and development house Bang Bang Gaming for the release of Jekyllz Wild Ultranudge. The new 5×3 slot has found its inspiration in the popular Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide story and it was released in time to hit online casino lobbies just in time for the spooky season.</p>

<p>Nudge Your Way Toward Big Wins</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and Bang Bang Games invite you to set foot inside the hidden and mysterious laboratory that belongs to the infamous Dr Jekyll. His magic potion is seen acting unexpectedly on the Dr, turning him into Mr Hyde while pumping out some huge wins. This is especially true when the special Ultranudge feature is engaged. When this occurs, all wins that feature a Wild symbol either represented by Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde are automatically nudged down a single position on the reels. In turn, this boosts their win potential and gives players an extra chase to get their hands on the bonus feature on each new winning spin. The nudges go on until the point where there are no more other wins possible.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new release, Yggrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy explained that the company thought of Halloween as the “perfect time to launch the ever so devious Jekyllz Wild Ultranudge.” He further explained that players should keep a close eye on “the nefarious Mr Hyde” symbol as he is capable of boosting the multiplier and bringing in the big wins. Bang bang Games’ managing director Frank McPolin added that the studio continuously tries to “bring innovation and excitement” to all its games, hence arguing why the Ultranudge feature was added to the new slot. McPolin called the game one “filled with win potential and plenty of fun.”</p>
<p>Potion Cash Symbols Bring up to 50x Cash Prizes</p>
<p>The game also features a special money collection feature called Potion Cash. Players need to keep an eye on these potions with a cash value that can reach 50x and collect them as part of a winning combo with the Mr Hyde wild symbol. All Mr Hyde symbols visible on the reels have the potential of increasing their multiplier by 1x for every Ultranudge.</p>
<p>There are also three symbols that can reward players with free spins and trigger the Ultranudge feature for random wins during the round. Prior to entering the Free Spins round, players are allowed to gamble in exchange for a Mr Hyde multiplier valued at 10x. In some jurisdictions, players can jump straight into the bonus round by accessing Buy Mode. At the same time, Mr Hyde multipliers can keep growing until they are nudged off the grid.</p>
<p>At the end of September, Yggrasil launched Calavera Crush, a slot with the Day of the Dead theme in place loaded multipliers. Together with Peter &amp; Sons, the company also released Voodoo Hex, another mystery-packed title with scatters and Mystery Stack Respins.</p>
