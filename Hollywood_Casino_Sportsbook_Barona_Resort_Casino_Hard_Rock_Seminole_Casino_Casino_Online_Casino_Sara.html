    <h1>Hollywood Casino Sportsbook Barona Resort Casino Hard Rock Seminole Casino Casino Online Casino Sara</h1>

<p>Despite being a legal and licensed company authorized to operate in Portugal, Goldenpark seems to be struggling with paying it's clients.</p>
<p>I have 140â‚¬ which I can't withdraw because they say I have another account associated to my IP Adress what it's not true. I send what they asked my to send and also gave them a selfie with my ID to give them another proof.</p>
<p>I sent all the documents needed to verify my account. They verified my account and I told them in chat that I didn't had bank account and they responded that wasn't a problem. To deposit via paysafecard which I did. Now they don't let me withdraw my money via paysafecard or something else and said that I had another account with this IP like I said before.</p>
<p>They don't answer phone calls, they don't respond to emails, and I've spent more than 6 hours (spread across multiple days) waiting in the chat to be successfully attended to. (they then asked me for everything)</p>
<p>I highlight that this company is becoming known not only for not verifying accounts, but also for accusing many users of having their accounts associated with another IP address like they did to me, thereby not verifying the accounts and avoiding the responsibility to make the payments.</p>
<p>If my withdrawal isn't processed, I will file a complaint and advise everyone else who is facing these same issues to join me in reporting this directly to the Service of Regulation and Inspection of Games (SRIJ), because I did everything they said like playing the deposit and they are tricking me and I think this casino are becoming a scam.</p>
