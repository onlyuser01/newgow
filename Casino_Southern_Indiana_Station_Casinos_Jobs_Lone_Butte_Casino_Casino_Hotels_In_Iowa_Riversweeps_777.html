<p>Hybrid Sports League and BetGames’ recently launched sports vertical, Twain Sport, announced a groundbreaking deal with Super Group-owned Betway for the market in Africa. Under the terms of the new deal announced Tuesday, Twain debuts in Africa which boosts its global presence and helps it reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Betway Teams up with Twain Sport</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest collaboration, the innovative hybrid sports product will become available for Betway’s growing customer base in South Africa. In addition, the collaboration is expected to see Twain enter new emerging markets across the continent where Betway already has established its presence. The new collaboration seeks to offer a new form of live sports entertainment. The increasingly popular Twain Sport is expected to fill in this particular gap and deliver engaging entertainment for sports fans.</p>
<p>Currently, Twain offers T-Basket, a tournament game that features head-to-head basketball tournaments. This is the first such game for the market that has the ability to offer scalable entertainment, considering it features basketball tournaments every hour, or one match every three minutes. This grants sports fans 6,300 events monthly.</p>
<p>Twain Sport explained that T-Basket “features professional athletes competing head-to-head to score the most points in 60 seconds.” Eight players can participate in a tournament and with a new game every three minutes, in just one hour, sports fans can experience a lot of thrilling action.</p>
<p>Besides the exciting experiences the new deal will bring, African bettors will also be able to benefit from the game’s mobile-first and easy-to-use design. T-Basket is expected to get the attention of a wide demographic of bettors and quickly prove to be a leading tournament game in the country.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Betway’s head of marketing, Mark Rowles, said that the company is delighted to see the launch of Twain Sport for the African market. He explained that Betway is looking forward to the success this innovative platform will bring to the market in the country.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to launch the Twain Sport offering across our African markets and look forward to seeing the traction of this innovative new feature across our existing offering.“ Mark Rowles head of marketing at Betway</p>
<p>BetGames’ VP of sales, Africa, James Everett, added: “Africa as a whole is a hotbed for sports betting and the Twain Sport proposition is perfectly suited to match the rapidly-growing demand for contemporary entertainment in the space.” He predicted that T-kick and T-basket will deliver a significant boost for Betway. Finally, Everett said that the company is delighted to join forces with such a respected partner for the key market.</p>
