    <h1>12 Tribes Lake Chelan Casino Morango Casino Casino In Seattle Casino Ocean City Chin Chin New York N</h1>

<p>The former NFL star was involved in a fatal car crash in 2021, putting a sudden halt to his promising career</p>
<p>After over two years in court, the case is finally nearing its conclusion. Ruggs’ guilty plea should significantly reduce his sentence, placing him in prison between three and ten years. The incident is a tragic reminder of the dangers of drunk driving and draws attention to the NFL’s decision to suspend its ride service program.</p>
<p>The Tragic Case Nears Its Conclusion</p>
<p>Henry Ruggs’ case has attracted widespread attention due to the athlete’s background as a high-profile NFL player. He was a first-round draft pick of the Las Vegas Raiders in 2020 but got released from the team following the crash. Ruggs played in 13 games for the Raiders in 2021, catching 24 passes for 469 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>On 2 November 2021, Ruggs was driving his Corvette at over 127 mph when he hit the back of a Toyota RAV4. The other car burst into flames, killing 23-year-old Tina Tintor trapped inside. Ruggs received charges of DUI resulting in death and reckless driving, which is one of the most heinous charges for such a situation.</p>
<p>Despite the guilty plea, Ruggs’ career may suffer irrecoverable damage. The possible sentence of three to ten years behind bars is a lifetime for a promising young athlete and may severely restrict his options after serving his due. A final court decision on 9 August will decide the extent of the punishment.</p>
<p>Tintor’s Death Was Preventable</p>
<p>The incident highlighted the issue of drunk driving, particularly in the United States. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 10,142 deaths in alcohol-impaired driving crashes in 2019, accounting for 28% of all traffic-related deaths in the US. Although tragic, Ruggs’ high-profile case can help spread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>As with most such cases, the crash was preventable. The NFL Players Association (NFPA) previously had an athlete ride service program but ended it in 2019 due to the proliferation of similar services. That fact and Ruggs’ recklessness ultimately cost the life of Tina Tintor, then 23, and her dog, Max.</p>
<p>No sentence will ever bring Tina and Max back, but we hope that everyone learns from this preventable incident so that no other families suffer like we do. Statement from Tina Tintor’s family</p>
<p>Although Ruggs will serve his sentence, the case should be a potent reminder for the NFLPA to reevaluate its practices, place additional focus on safe driving practice reminders, and ensure members have alternative transportation options. Giving players the resources they need to make safe choices can hopefully prevent similar future tragedies.</p>
