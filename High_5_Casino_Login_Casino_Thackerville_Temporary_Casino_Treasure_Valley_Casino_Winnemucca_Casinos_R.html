<p>The deal will see BoscaSports arm Nicosia Race Club’s retail venues with its pool betting display platform</p>
<p>Racecourse Media Group (RMG) has joined forces with Nicosia Race Club (NRC) and BoscaSports to launch the latter company’s pool betting display platform across retail venues in Cyprus. In total, 125 retail outlets and the NRC’s racecourse will be equipped with new screens and content.</p>
<p>RMG, which has been working alongside NRC for a while, trusts the club as a valued partner. NRC has been using the racing specialist’s cutting-edge horse racing content for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>RMG said that it is delighted to bring NRC and BoscaSports together and deliver best-in-class digital display screens to the Cyprus market. The launch will support the racing specialist’s premium content, which includes racing from Epsom, Newmarket, York and Goodwood via the Racing TVi global betting service.</p>
<p>BoscaSports is a seasoned company that already provides the digital display platform at 85 of the 86 racecourses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The company worked alongside NRC to change old analog systems, modernizing the club’s offering and allowing it to engage customers with RacingTVi content.</p>
<p>The new development is in line with BoscaSports’ ongoing global expansion and investments in key markets. The company remains committed to quickly rolling out cost-effective solutions and providing schedule, content and pricing automation on all RacingTVi races.</p>
<p>Delivering Better Racing Content in Cyprus</p>
<p>Nicosia Race Club’s general manager, George Hadjiminas, commented on the new launch, noting that British and Irish horse racing is very popular in Cyprus and among the club’s customers. Hadjiminas added that he is looking forward to seeing the customer reception of the new screens.</p>
<p>We are delighted to work with RMG and BoscaSports to deploy the new digital screens in our betting outlets and racecourse. We expect the new screens to be well received by our customers. George Hadjiminas, GM, NRC</p>
<p>BoscaSports’ chief executive officer, Eugene Mitchell, also commented on the agreement, saying that he feels fantastic to have agreed on this deal with NRC.</p>
<p>This is the first full market roll-out for the BoscaSports platform, and we are delighted it is a country with such a rich tradition of horseracing. Eugene Mitchell, CEO, BoscaSports</p>
<p>Finally, Ian Houghton, Racecourse Media Group’s international director, said that both NRC and BoscaSports are amazing partners. Houghton added that his team is glad by the opportunity to supply its masterpiece screens to Cyprus.</p>
<p>RMG are delighted to play its part in delivering state-of-the-art digital screens to Cyprus and we are hopeful that the additional data supplied, along with the modern presentation, means that the wagering customer will be much better informed. Ian Houghton, international director, RMG</p>
<p>Last year, RMG extended the term of its acting chair, Roger Lewis.</p>
