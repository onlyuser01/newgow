    <h1>Aquarius Casino Laughlin The Palms Hotel And Casino Online Casino Bonus No Deposit Danbury Casino Ro</h1>

<p>Hi Nick, I've been answering your questions about the verification process for about 1 week.</p>
<p>The documents that they ask me for at the moment have been rejected 3 times since the casino takes about 2 days to respond</p>
<p>The last time I spoke to mr bet casino was yesterday. There they asked me to send the documents again because according to them the document they require must show my name and my identification and there it appears the same, I will attach a capture of the certificate issued by the Falabella bank, which is the bank I use to make payments in the casino. Since that document was rejected, I tried to send the bank statement and I also think it was rejected because an (x) appears on the verification page. Apart from that, via chat with the support team, they ask me to send the proof through the verification page and to send via email to verify my residence in the country through an employment contract. I sent both things. And today, 06/10, I received an email from the assistance team that I cannot send any document by any other means than the verification page and they themselves told me that. I will also send a capture of the email that they sent me where they prove it so. Actually, it seems that they are playing to make the client get tired. But I won't do it because it's my money and besides I like to play in the casino. In truth, with the deposits and you they have always been very responsible but I do not understand how after checking my verified account they ask for that again, it seems absurd to me because I have not made any changes so far.</p>
