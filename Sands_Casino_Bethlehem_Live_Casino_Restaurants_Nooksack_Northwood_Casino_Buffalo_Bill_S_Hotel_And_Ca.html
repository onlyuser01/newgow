<p>Hartman was in charge of the regulator when the Centennial State officially introduced legal sports betting in May 2020. His tenure was notable for a level-headed and pragmatic approach, focusing on dialogue with operators and responsible gaming initiatives. Hartman was generally content with the organization’s accomplishments, noting it had more or less mastered the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Hartman Is a Consummate Professional</p>
<p>Dan Hartman has spent most of his career working with the Colorado state government. His early experience with greyhound racing helped kickstart his career as a manager at the Division of Gaming, where he spent over 19 years. After a brief stint as director of the state’s Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division, he moved back into his element as head of the Division of Racing Events.</p>
<p>With significant wagering experience and a clear understanding of the industry, Hartman also took charge of the Colorado Division of Gaming in August 2019 and played a pivotal role in establishing the state’s regulatory framework. His methodical approach and relentless efforts to curb illegal gambling won him the 2022’s Gaming Law Regulator of the Year Award and the high esteem of his peers.</p>
<p>The Future Director Will Inherit a Strong and Effective Organization</p>
<p>According to Hartman, the Colorado Division of Gaming was now in a good spot, making it a good time for him to take his leave without worry. In an interview with media outlet SportsHandle, the retiring director lauded the regulator’s accomplishments. He noted that there was always more to do but was confident that his leaving would not cause disruptions.</p>
<p>I think it’s a point in time where I’ve done quite a bit… Things are kind of getting to a point where they’re pretty solid. Dan Hartman, director of the Colorado Division of Gaming</p>
<p>The regulator has not yet revealed who will inherit the governing position. Hartman should have significant sway in the choice of successor, and finding a suitable replacement will likely be one of his final challenges as director. The Colorado government has already submitted a job posting with suitably stringent requirements and appears more than willing to look outside the state if needed.</p>
<p>The new director will primarily maintain, enforce and develop new regulations, so a background related to the gambling industry will undoubtedly be an advantage. Colorado sportsbooks are experiencing continued revenue growth, reflecting a strong and healthy sports betting sector. An active and effective regulator is an indispensable part of that ecosystem, so the Division of Gaming needs to be extra careful when choosing its future leadership.</p>
