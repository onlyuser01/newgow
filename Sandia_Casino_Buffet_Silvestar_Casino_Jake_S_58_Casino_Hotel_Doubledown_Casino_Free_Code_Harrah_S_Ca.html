<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>Although the processes in the casino are not ideally set, we are able to accept it due to the limitations of its platform. Therefore, after gathering and reviewing all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified.</p>
<p>As for real money and the invalid part of your winnings from the weekly cashback - a different situation would have occurred if significant winnings had been obtained earlier, from your real money balance ($150). In such a situation, we would further discuss it with the casino.</p>
<p>You managed to win using the weekly cashback bonus and meet the wagering requirements. The maximum cashout for this bonus is $100. Your balance at the time of requesting a withdrawal was $1195,86. If there had not been a problem with your withdrawal and it had been processed successfully, the casino would have paid you $100, and the rest of the winnings would have been canceled. However, your withdrawal was denied and $1195,86 was returned to your balance. For better imagination, let's say you had $100 of real money and $1095,86 of "fictitious money" that otherwise would have been voided upon a successful withdrawal. Then, you made a deposit of $50, which means you mixed the winnings from the bonus with new real money. The most important thing is that if you had only had $150 in your real money balance, you would have lost them after approximately 40 minutes of playing. But, in your case, from the moment you lost your real money balance ($150), there was only "fictitious money", and you continued playing with them. Unfortunately, significant winnings came later - from "fictitious money". When your 2 withdrawals ($5000) were denied, you lost the remaining balance by playing, and the casino credited your account with the original $50. Those were gambled away too. Moreover, before your account was credited with $50, your balance was $0,09, which means you had to notice it.</p>
<p>Based on the data provided, we were able to recalculate your game taking into account the real money balance and the winnings from the bonus separately, and simulate playing without the so-called "mixing funds". I would like to explain the situation and our decision in more detail.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Nick, for the provided data and details. It helped to consider the case sufficiently.</p>
