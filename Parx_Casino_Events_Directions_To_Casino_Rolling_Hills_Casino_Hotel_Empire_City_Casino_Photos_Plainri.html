    <h1>Parx Casino Events Directions To Casino Rolling Hills Casino Hotel Empire City Casino Photos Plainri</h1>

<p>Dear Kristina,</p>
<p>Once again thank you for helping me in this seemingly hopeless situation .. I’ve attached the report (as per below👇) on the gaming details which provide the answer of my betting details:</p>
<p>banker:$115</p>
<p>banker Pair:$7</p>
<p>player Pair:$7</p>
<p>Tie: $8</p>
<p>Total payout:$11,508.25.</p>
<p>May 23rd Monday, the day that I won and attempt to withdraw. I first contacted their Live support/chat when I saw that my withdrawal was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The officer said my withdrawal needed to go through check by their vendor and that I needed to complete ‘KYC’ process - submitting Identity document and taking selfie with it. Without delay, I did what was told and uploaded the docs to their system.</p>
<p>Despite that, still have to wait for around 1 day for their vendor (I don’t know what that is?) to check and revert back.</p>
<p>Meantime, they will have one of their staff to WhatsApp me to update me on the withdrawal progress.</p>
<p>The screenshot taken below was the conversation I had with 96Ace representative who WhatsApp me shortly after I ended the chat with their Live support.</p>
<p>In addition, I would also like to highlight a few important points during the course of playing at 96Ace.</p>
<p>In just 1-2 weeks after I joined 96Ace I’ve made approximately 13 times DEPOSIT as a less than a month new member.</p>
<p>My winnings from the game they faulted me was total $$11508, my last credit balance was $14,800 (minus $300 my own deposit) $14,500. At the very least I deserve to have the difference paid to me ($14,500- $11508.)</p>
<p>I’ve withdrawn twice (I think) however I’m sure of one withdrawal made because it was $4k plus.</p>
<p>I was not informed that I needed to complete a ‘KYC’ process.</p>
<p>I’ve been a member with ECLBET, 9club, God55 for more than 2 years and less than a year with maxim88.</p>
<p>Never have I encountered such delay with outstanding requirement not mentioned in the first place. Therefore I felt uneasy, thinking if they’ll find fault by making up something denying me of my winnings and indeed in less than 24 hours, my fear was actualised when I received the WhatsApp saying they will not pay me plus shut down my account. Really unethical and unfair of them.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there’s anything in else you need in this matter. Really Appreciate your kind attention and offer to help 🙏</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>samuel</p>
