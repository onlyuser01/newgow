<p>At the beginning of April 2022, Blueprint Gaming, the leading game studio that is part of the Gauselmann Group, received a supplier license for Ontario's freshly regulated gaming market</p>
<p>Now, the company that creates “exciting slot games for the global online and mobile markets” has inked a new agreement with NorthStar Gaming, building more momentum on Canadian soil.</p>
<p>Ontario: a Key Market in Blueprint Gaming’s Growth</p>
<p>According to the new deal, the company that owns and operates NorthStar Bets will see Blueprint eventually launch its entire portfolio of slots for its players in Ontario. Currently, gamers can enjoy a series of popular games from the studio, including The Goonies, Fishing Frenzy: The Big Catch, Ted, Eye of Horus Megaways, and Wolf Legend Megaways.</p>
<p>Other games part of the current offering include Deal or No Deal, a gameshow title that has already attracted a large audience in the region since its launch, together with another industry-leading title, Jackpot King. The latter is a progressive jackpot system that has been rebranded as Jackpot Royale and is fully customized to match the requirements of the Ontario market. The Ontario-based brand will this way continue to provide its players with a one-of-a-kind, local, top-tier user experience on its casino platform while reaching a more diversified audience eager to get access to content tailored to the Canadian market.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming’s director of key accounts and marketing UK Jo Purvis called Ontario a key market that has proven to be critical for their “growth across regulated markets in 2022”. Purvis added that the new partnership with NorthStar Bets represents an essential factor in their expansion across the North American region as it would help them place their slots portfolio into the hands of an “impressive swathe of new players”.</p>
<p>NorthStar, “Proud” to Offer a Premium Gaming Experience to Ontario Players</p>
<p>NorthStar Gaming’s chief executive officer and founding partner Michael Moskowitz expressed the company’s excitement to be able to offer a “uniquely local, content-driven, and premium gaming experience” to players in Ontario. He further explained that as the company is continuing its growth and expanding its offering in the region, it is essential to team up with “reputable and established suppliers of quality gaming experiences”, thus welcoming Blueprint Gaming to the NorthStar Bets roster of reputable partners.</p>
<p>Last October, Blueprint Gaming further boosted the visibility of its top products with soccer fans. The brand offered sports aficionados the unique opportunity to turn into online casino players by securing the necessary licensing rights to the personality and likeness of Diego Maradona. The legendary player would be featured in a future branded slot release that is expected to attract a lot of soccer lovers.</p>
<p>During the same month, Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. signed an agreement with OpenGaming, adding Blueprint Gaming to the list of slot providers that will offer their games to global audiences via its content aggregation platform.</p>
