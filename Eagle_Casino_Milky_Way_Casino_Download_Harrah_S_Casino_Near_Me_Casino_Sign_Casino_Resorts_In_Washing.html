<p>The Slot Brings Sticky Respin, Free Spins and Symbol Upgrade</p>
<p>During the base gameplay, players of Thunderkick’s new slot can trigger a special Sticky Respin feature. Once this happens, a random symbol is selected and presented above the reel. Landing more than five symbols within the game will lock them into place and they will remain until no further such symbols appear. After that, a corresponding prize is awarded.</p>
<p>Similarly to Sticky Respin, Game Area Expansion symbol can appear on any spin. This feature enables a new row to be added at the bottom of the reel, expanding the game area. The slot can expand to a maximum of seven rows, creating the potential for huge payouts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Symbol Upgrade feature can also be triggered along with a Sticky Respin. Thanks to this feature, selected symbols can be transformed into symbols with higher values. Ultimately, if all the features are combined, players have the opportunity to secure significant prizes.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Grand Melee offers a Free Spins bonus game that can be activated by landing five or more Bonus symbols on any spin. Underneath the reel, a bonus meter tracks if enough symbols are secured to engage in the bonus round.</p>
