    <h1>Sloto Stars Casino Casino Hollywood Florida Menomonie Casino 3 Rivers Casino Santa Fe Casino Movies</h1>

<p>Jokerino just wants to make money, but doesn't pay out.</p>
<p>The verification for withdrawals doesn't work, don't want to be bothered with withdrawals.</p>
<p>Your email page info @ jokerino. com, so your support is defective or no longer exists, so it will be displayed and a live chat, which probably once existed, no longer exists.</p>
<p>I am waiting there for a payout of 1900 euros, which I honestly won without using a bonus and you owe a lot more money to others.</p>
<p>You just get spam all the time that you should play more.</p>
<p>They will probably close it soon and then reopen it under a different name and wait until we stupid players fall for it again.</p>
<p>This group of casinos also includes many others and the main seat is probably this gambling city next to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I can't think of the name of this city-state right now.</p>
<p>In any case, the fact is I had deposited 50 euros without a bonus or free spins and in the end made a profit.</p>
<p>When verifying you can upload the images of ID, bank statements or other proof that the account belongs to you with an alleged forwarding, but if you go out there again and look after a few days, the same is still requested and you get it no confirmation of receipt of the documents or any response at all.</p>
<p>I then tried to e-mail the documents to Jokerino to your support info@jokerino.com, but the message came up that this e-mail address was incorrect and probably no longer exists or was blocked by Jokerino himself because the Complaints are probably very many.</p>
<p>Simply continuing to send emails in order to lure even more into the trap and not make legitimate payments to customers is bold.</p>
<p>I think Jokerino is now actually a case for the supervisory authorities and should be closed, but it will probably be of no use because they will then simply continue under a different name.</p>
<p>I will probably never see the money, like many other Jokerino players will not.</p>
<p>Feel free to try to help, but Jokerino will probably never answer you</p>
