    <h1>Texas Casinos Bettendorf Iowa Casinos Free Codes For Doubledown Casino Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’ closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I’m sure you understand the difference between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What player can do if she is unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude herself, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem)</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed in this, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
