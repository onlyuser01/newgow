<p>Light &amp; Wonder will be bringing more fresh iGaming content to BetMGM, one of the leading brands in the North American interactive online casino market. The content will be developed by Design Works Gaming, a prominent iGaming supplier and studio, and delivered to BetMGM through Light &amp; Wonder’s proprietary OpenGaming platform.</p>
<p>BetMGM Gets Content from Design Works Gaming in New Jersey</p>
<p>Players in New Jersey will be able to access the products by the Arizona-based game developer through BetMGM’s local casino. The partnership focuses on an initial launch in the Garden State, but all partners are determined to continue scaling up this proposition and rolling out the products in additional states.</p>
<p>This would once again be made easy thanks to OpenGaming’s delivery system which makes for quick and easy product rollouts. The partnership is an important milestone for DWG which is determined to demonstrate the quality of its products and competitiveness in the US market. DWG is the author of immersive and dynamic content, which fit nicely with BetMGM’s portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder digital partnerships director Steve Mayes also welcomed the opportunity. He praised the fact that DWG is a well-seasoned local developer that has market-specific knowledge of the North American region. As a result, DWG is able to tailor its products and offering to the specific preferences of local players.</p>
<p>Integrating the developer’s portfolio with BetMGM’s audience can only benefit all companies involved, Mayes continued. As to BetMGM director of gaming, Oliver Bartlett, the man is happy with the partnership as well. DWG’s reputation is well-deserved, Barlett explained.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to be able to put its iGaming offering in front of our players and look forward to further launches as part of our successful OpenGaming partnership,” he concluded. Design Works Gaming is also expanding in the United Kingdom, signing partnerships with 888 and Mr. Green.</p>
