    <h1>Ruidoso Casino Casino Hotel Las Vegas Doubleu Casino Free Chips Facebook Online Casino Bonus Ohne Ei</h1>

<p>so the Problem started 2 days ago.</p>
<p>I used to play at n1 since I opened my account on September 2021. but I decided to terminate the account on Janus 2022 because I was having only big losses.</p>
<p>so after a month of closing the account, I contact Amanda from VIP to reopen the account and she says yes but you have to wait 24h. I deliberately ask if I need to resubmit any information and she says only if you use a new deposit method. So I do, and just to make sure I contact live support to have a confirmation. The person say yes my account is fully verified and I can withdraw at any time. I say perfect then. So 2days ago I have a small win of 900eur and I decide to cash out, guess what, they tell me the documentation was missing, which pissed me off because I deliberately contacted them to reassure me everything was in order so I could make a deposit. The verification takes around 1 day and by that time i had already lost all the balance. The VIP manager Amanda was nice enough and she gave me a personal vip Bonus with 10x wager. Guess what I made around 4K, but again the first problem pops up. I can only withdraw with Paysafe. The time passes and I end up with a 1300eur balance and say I’m done and put a 10min log out on responsible gambling in setting.</p>
<p>from 1 second to another I see that my balance disappeared and my account was blocked. So I Write an E-Mail to the VIP Manager saying what’s going on. She tells me she unfortunate news and that the balance of the winnings has been confiscated because I surpassed 5eur max bet limit. She allowed me to withdraw 500 euros thank her soul.</p>
<p>my problem is why don’t I receive a message or their is nothing preventing me to surpass the 5 eur bet amount. I find this absurd because they don’t give any indication while your playing that u surpassed the bet but when u try to withdraw then it becomes a problem.</p>
