    <h1>Oyo Hotel Casino East Tropicana Avenue Las Vegas Nv Prairie Wind Casino Hotel Mobile Casino Real Mon</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming, Casumo and 4ThePlayer jointly crowned an eighth Dream Drop Mega Jackpot winner, providing him with over two million dollars.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming, an aggregator and supplier of iGaming content, has helped another player win a prize of over a million. This time, a player won $2,552,362, thanks to Relax’s revolutionary Dream Drop Jackpots mechanic.</p>
<p>The prize was won at Casumo’s online casino. The lucky customer became rich after placing a $0.66 wager on 5K Gold Mine Dream Drop, one of the newest games from Relax’s Silver Bullet partner 4ThePlayer.</p>
<p>The game that helped the jackpot winner take over two million dollars home is a Wild West-themed adventure, packed with features that allow customers to multiply their stake. The game was only released on April 18, which goes to highlight Relax Gaming’s capabilities to design unique mechanics that allow players to win.</p>
<p>According to the supplier, Dream Drop Jackpots is the most lucrative jackpot product ever. Relax Gaming noted that the current win comes just a few weeks after the seventh Dram Drop jackpot was secured by another player.</p>
<p>Relax, Casumo and 4ThePlayer Praised the Winner</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s chief executive officer, congratulated the winner. He noted that the Dream Drop Jackpot feature is now almost a year old and said that there is no better way to celebrate the anniversary than to see someone win one of the Mega Jackpots.</p>
<p>Awarding eight top-tier jackpots in less than twelve months is no mean feat. It’s fair to say that Dream Drop Jackpots have truly revolutionized the space, what’s more, this really is only the beginning. Simon Hammon, CEO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 4ThePlayer’s founder and CEO, Andrew Porter, exclaimed that he is delighted one of the studio’s games helped a player become a millionaire. Porter added that moments like this one are why 4ThePlayer wanted to create a Dream Drop Game.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the player was congratulated by Tim De Borle, Casumo’s chief operating officer. De Borle said that the brand is thrilled when one of its players wins such a prize.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is one of the best casino suppliers in the world, providing over 4,000+ iGaming titles from proprietary and third-party studios.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dream Drop titles, the operator just unveiled another game sporting this thrilling mechanic, namely Hellcatraz II Dream Drop. The new title is a 5×5 slot that boasts an old-school 8-bit aesthetic, designed to evoke the feeling of older-gen SEGA and Nintendo games.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, Relax Gaming penned two Greece-oriented deals with Interwetten and Betsson.</p>
