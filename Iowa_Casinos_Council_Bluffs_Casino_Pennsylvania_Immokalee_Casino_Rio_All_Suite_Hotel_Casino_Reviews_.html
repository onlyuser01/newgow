<p>D. G. Yuengling &amp; Son, the oldest brewing company in America, has once again joined forces with the daily fantasy sports and sports betting company DraftKings. The agreement will see the brewery sponsor various betting challenges for the 2022 edition of the March Madness basketball tournament.</p>
<p>Yuengling Provides $100,000 for Prizes</p>
<p>The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament (also known as March Madness) is one of the most popular collegiate basketball events in the United States. DraftKings has named Yuengling as an exclusive sponsor to celebrate the anticipated event. The brewing company will offer a total of $100,000 through various community-oriented contests.</p>
<p>The Yuengling Bracket Battle is one of the challenges that will take place between March 13 and April 4. Players can take their picks at the start of the tournament and compete for a share of the $60,000 prize pool. Players can also participate in a free-to-enter challenge called Yuengling Bracket Pick’em and take a shot at the $40,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Yuengling will promote DraftKings’ brand by launching limited edition products bearing the operator’s logo. The exclusive merchandise will be available in Yuengling’s shops across 23 US states. DraftKings’ branding will be visible on top products, such as Yuengling’s Black &amp; Tan, Golden Pilsner, Light Lager 99, and the Traditional Lager packs. Beer lovers can also expect to find co-branded aluminum cups in Yuengling’s shops and in restaurants that offer the company’s beverages.</p>
<p>Appealing to Fans’ Passions Is Yuengling’s Key Strategy</p>
<p>Customers will be prompted to join the exclusive challenges on DraftKings’ platform and try to win a share of the tempting $100,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Wendy Yuengling, a sixth-generation member of the Yuengling family, now serving as the company’s chief administrative officer, spoke on the commitment to sports and sports betting. She said that being America’s oldest brewery comes with certain expectorations and therefore Yuengling is always seeking to appeal to its fans. According to her, there is no better way to do this than to appeal to the greatest passions of beer lovers.</p>
<p>Wendy Yuengling added that the success of 2021’s collaboration is what prompted the brewery to continue working with DraftKings.</p>
<p>“When we saw how much consumers and retailers enjoyed our basketball collaboration last year, we did not want to miss the opportunity to work with DraftKings again, in association with our flagship Lager brand, and make unforgettable sports moments together.” Wendy Yuengling</p>
<p>Speaking of DraftKings and March Madness, the operator recently added Primetime NFT series to its offerings.</p>
