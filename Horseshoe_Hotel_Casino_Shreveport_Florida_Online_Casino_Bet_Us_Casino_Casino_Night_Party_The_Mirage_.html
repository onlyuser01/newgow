<p>Denmark has proven itself to be at the forefront of player protection measures by offering ROFUS (Register of Voluntarily Excluded Players), a self-exclusion tool that allows players to take a break from gambling</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2012, the number of registrants has been on a steady increase, with over 40,000 Danes having signed up for the scheme.</p>
<p>Danish Gambling Authority Credits Awareness Campaigns for Increase in ROFUS Registrants</p>
<p>Anders Dorph, director of the Danish Gambling Authority, Spillemyndigheden, notes that the increasing number of registrants proves that ROFUS is a useful tool that makes sense. He emphasizes that ROFUS plays an important role in ensuring that players who need a break have access to one.</p>
<p>One reason for the rise in ROFUS registrants is the Danish Gambling Authorityâ€™s efforts to raise awareness of the scheme. Since 2016, the Authority has been running campaigns on TV and social media to let people know about ROFUS. Their efforts have paid off, with 45% of Danes surveyed in 2021 indicating that they knew about the tool.</p>
<p>In 2020, online providers were mandated to refer to ROFUS in their marketing efforts. This move has further raised awareness of the scheme.</p>
<p>The majority of ROFUS registrants have chosen to permanently exclude themselves from gambling. 66% of players who sign up choose this option, although players can opt out of the register after a year by contacting the Danish Gambling Authority. Additionally, most registrants are men, with men making up 76% of self-excluded players in February 2023.</p>
<p>Anders Dorph believes that it is essential to have tools like ROFUS to ensure that players who need a break can take one easily and effectively. In addition to ROFUS, the Danish Gambling Authority also runs the counseling line StopSpillet, which provides advice and guidance to players, relatives, and professionals dealing with compulsive gambling.</p>
<p>With ROFUS and StopSpillet, Denmark is leading the way in player protection measures, making it easier for players to take a break from gambling and access support when they need it.</p>
<p>ROFUS Got 10,000 More Registrants in Just One Year</p>
<p>Back in December 2022, the Danish Gambling Authority announced that it has improved its self-exclusion register, known as ROFUS, to provide better protection for vulnerable individuals. The updated system now has a user-friendly interface, which makes it easier for individuals to self-exclude all licensed gambling activities in the country.</p>
<p>As of January 2022, over 30,000 people had registered with ROFUS, which goes to show that in just one year 10,000 more people have registered for the service. In the December update, the regulator also increased the period of exclusion from one to five years, allowing individuals more time to recover and seek help if needed.</p>
