<p>After ‘Nova easily took care of business Saturday night against Kansas, the final remaining #1 seed, the Wildcats face #3 Michigan Monday night for a chance to cut down the nets.</p>
<p>The Wolverines mounted a second-half comeback against March Madness Cinderella Loyola Chicago to prevail 69-57.</p>
<p>The general consensus among Las Vegas and online sportsbooks has Villanova spotting Michigan 6.5 points in the spread, and the over/under at 145. It’s the largest spread since Duke was favored by seven over Butler in 2010.</p>
<p>Bettors in Las Vegas will find better odds for the underdog at Wynn and Station Casinos sportsbooks, which both have Michigan a tad longer at seven points.</p>
<p>The men’s national championship game tips off tonight at 9:20 pm ET on CBS.</p>
<p>Sin City Wins</p>
<p>The story of 2018 March Madness to the Final Four was unquestionably Chicago Loyola, as the Ramblers became just the fourth #11 seed to reach the Final Four. Armed with Sister Jean by their side, sports bettors had faith that the Catholic university could do the unthinkable in completing their fifth straight upset.</p>
<p>ESPN’s David Purdum reported on Saturday that in the time between the conclusion of the Elite Eight and start of the Final Four, roughly 50 percent of the bets wagered on winning the NCAA tournament were on Loyola Chicago at multiple Las Vegas sportsbooks. Prior to the semifinals, the Ramblers remained the long underdog of the four at 12/1.</p>
<p>As for the Loyola Chicago vs. Michigan game, more money was on the underdog. The Las Vegas SuperBook said about 60 percent of the cash was on the Ramblers.</p>
<p>William Hill said before the 68-team madness began, it took 32 title bets on Loyola Chicago at 300/1 odds. The largest was a $150 bet that would have net $45,000.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks also fared well with Villanova, as many bettors felt Kansas wasn’t being properly respected. Caesars said it took four times as much money on the underdog than ‘Nova.</p>
<p>Stevens’ Big Michigan Bet</p>
<p>D Casino owner Derek Stevens is becoming famous for his NCAA March Madness betting.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive year, he placed $11,000 on each of the 32 First Round games. He also once again put $25,000 on his beloved Michigan Wolverines to win the entire tourney.</p>
<p>Should Michigan find a way to upset the seemingly unstoppable Wildcats, Stevens will have a ticket to cash that will net $1 million. Fellow downtown casino owner Tilman Fertitta took the $25,000 wager on 40/1 odds.</p>
<p>With the Final Four being played on Easter weekend, Stevens tried to put heavenly powers on his side by placing a Pope Francis bobble head next to the $25,000 ticket slip.</p>
<p>Stevens says he will hedge the bet for the title game, but won’t reveal his positions until right before tip-off.</p>
