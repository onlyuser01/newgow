<p>The Denver Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs have been playing a tit-for-tat during the first stage of the playoffs, settling their beef with 2-2 so far. Only one team can win, though, and that will be settled on Tuesday, April 23, 2019.</p>
<p>San Antonio Spurs Meet Denver Nuggets in Decisive Fifth Game</p>
<p>The San Antonio Spurs and the Denver Nuggets have been one of the most contested games in the Western Conference. No other two teams have contested each other as much as these two.</p>
<p>After a 2-2 tie after the Nuggets managed to secure a decisive 117-103 victory over the Spurs on Saturday. It was an emotional game with Spurs’ DeMar DeRozan losing his temper quickly, throwing a ball at the referee.</p>
<p>The Nuggets benefited from their all-performing center player Nikola Jokic who managed to bring around 29 points. He was supported by Jamal Murray who plays point guard, but who managed to add 24 points to his name during the game.</p>
<p>Demonstrating a superb collective effort, the Nuggets showed the Spurs that a close game can always end up in a sour defeat. Yet, the two teams are quite well-matched. Yet, you can read quite a bit about how the inexperienced Nuggets are nowhere near capable of making it to the semi-finals. That’s not what we think, though.</p>
<p>Their historical head-to-head count clearly favors the San Antonio Spurs, but the Nuggets have been playing quite well recently. Here’s their most recent performance from the past four games:</p>
<p>Game 1 : Nuggets vs Spurs – 101-96</p>
<p>: Nuggets vs Spurs – 101-96 Game 2: Nuggets vs Spurs – 114-105</p>
<p>Nuggets vs Spurs – 114-105 Game 3: Nuggets vs Spurs – 108 – 118</p>
<p>Nuggets vs Spurs – 108 – 118 Game 4: Nuggets vs Spurs – 117-103</p>
<p>Game 1 was clearly the one where both teams were playing defensively and at a little slower pace, but that caution is now gone. The teams have picked up momentum and they are ready to apply themselves.</p>
<p>Spurs Will Be Coming Back in Game 5</p>
<p>Spurs did show a game that was subpar on Saturday with Derrick White pulling off a good performance, but not nearly as well as expected. Rudy Gay also seemed to struggle for the most part and DeMar DeRozan’s tantrum fit certainly didn’t seem to help much the case of the Spurs.</p>
<p>Spurs were demoralized by the steady lead that the Nuggets have been able to retain which led to one mistake after another.</p>
<p>However, they have enough time to regroup and reconsider their strategy which will give them a fair view of the playfield and hopefully bring them closer to the semi-finals.</p>
