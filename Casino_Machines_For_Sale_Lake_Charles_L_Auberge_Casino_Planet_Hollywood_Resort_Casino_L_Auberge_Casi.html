<p>3 Clown Monty review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around clowns.</p>
<p>In a chaotic carnival world, players will encounter a reel packed full of worse-for-wear clowns. Each of the red-nosed entertainers looks downtrodden or slightly insane, with their makeup slightly smudged.</p>
<p>Still, players will enjoy spotting the cream pies, smoking gorillas, and personified cars of this gritty circus. This is definitely not a game for anyone with a fear of clowns, but for fans of films such as Joker, the satirical vibe will hit the right spot.</p>
<p>Win in the 3 Clown Monty slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A creepy classic carnival tune plays, with its unstoppable notes full of violent cheer. The reels spin with the zing one would expect from a classic carnival game. Meanwhile, wins are applauded loudly, creating the sense that an audience is watching.</p>
<p>Each clown among the symbols has a different bright colour for their hair. With their smeared makeup and sad and maniacial expressions, it is clear these clowns have not led a joyful life.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, is a brick wall and an angrily smoking gorilla can be seen. This adds to the feeling that there are stakes in this game beyond a good time. Players will have fun getting into the rough and touch mood as the game goes on.</p>
<p>Overall, the music and graphics create a consistent atmosphere of a carnival crew down on their luck.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>3 Clown Monty is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Wild symbols may come with attached multipliers which are applied should that Wild be part of a winning combination.</p>
<p>If players land 2 Scatters, they can win extra Wild symbols or an additional Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Scatters, this triggers the Free Spins feature and Multiplier Wilds are activated. Players choose a card to randomly decide the number of free spins they will receive.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, Monty Spins are triggered and players will also choose a card at random to decide the number of Monty Spins. While in the Monty Spins feature, Wilds become sticky, remaining on the reels.</p>
<p>While in the Dealer’s Choice feature, Scatters will turn into Wild Scatters.</p>
<p>Possible options in the Free Spins card pick</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.23%, about our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>High paying symbols paytable</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility clown-themed slot.</p>
<p>With ample volatility and respectably high RTP, this game is a good pick for strategy-conscious players.</p>
<p>The gritty clown theme is consistent and well-animated, but definitely won’t be the right aesthetic for everyone. Players who are not fond of clowns should steer clear, but for the rest of us, this is a fun world to engage in.</p>
