<p>The Nordic gaming company, Paf, has now teamed up with Gotland Alandia Cruises and will feature various casino entertainment options onboard of the latter company’s M/S Birka Gotland cruise ship. The partnership will launch in 2024 and it will provide the necessary equipment to facilitate gaming entertainment aboard the ship. The first trip is booked for March of next year.</p>
<p>Now, the Gotland Alandia won’t actually cruise the high seas, as the scope of the cruise is a little less ambitious than that. Yet, travelers will get to enjoy a journey between Stockholm, Mariehamn and Visby.</p>
<p>Gotland Alandia Cruises is a joint project by two other companies, Gotlandsbolaget and Viking Line, which have come together to launch the new route, and adding gaming entertainment to it is the surest way to move forward and immediately differentiate the new cruise.</p>
<p>After all, if it’s good enough for Royal Caribbean, it ought to be good enough for Gotland Alandia Cruises logic dictates. Commenting on this opportunity, Paf Head of New Sales Jannik Svahnström, welcomed the chance to bring cutting-edge gaming concepts onboard of the newly-launched cruise and make the journey between the three destinations as memorable as possible for travelers. Svahnström added:</p>
<p>"We are really looking forward to starting our cooperation straight away. We want to contribute with a good concept for the games onboard. It will be an exciting challenge to get all the new gaming machines and table games in place in the coming months."</p>
<p>Gotland Alandia Cruises CEO Susanne Kaarnimo-Knight is similarly confident that Paf is a well-established company that will meet expectations and provide guests with a fantastic onboard gaming experience.</p>
<p>The cruise line will not just rely on gaming to keep guests entertained though, as there will also be restaurants, shopping promenade, and other amenities and facilities onboard the ship.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Paf actually entered into such arrangements. In fact, Paf is working with other cruise companies, including Tallink Grupp. The two partners extended on what was described as a successful partnership back in November and are committed to continuing to work together.</p>
<p>Casino onboard cruises have become, if not a mandatory amenity, a tempting part of the overall menu that keeps travelers interested and engaged.</p>
