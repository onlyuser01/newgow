    <h1>Casinos Tunica Casino Near Me Lake Of The Torches Casino Lac Du Flambeau Rivers Casino Des Plaines A</h1>

<p>Hello together ,</p>
<p>I have the problem that on August 26th, 2022 I made a deposit into my long-standing Platin Casino account.</p>
<p>After I won 300 euros and wanted to pay them out, I got the email the following day that I was missing proof of identification (proof of payment from Paysafecard), although I've been playing for years and could always pay out without any problems.</p>
<p>ps: I haven't paid in via Paysafe for at least 10 months.</p>
<p>What annoys me is that I didn't even deposit via Paysafe and why is it not asked for when making a deposit, but only when you've won something.</p>
<p>I wrote to the live chat, he gave me a period where I had deposited with Paysafe for 10 months and that I should call up this period for transactions on my Paysafe account and send the screenshot with email, redlino deposit and username etc. Unfortunately, it doesn't show me this on my Paysafe acc, so I don't know how to proceed. Was also a platinum premium member for a long time. The support is talking past me. I tried to send you my Paysafe account profile with customer number email etc. This was rejected because there is no deposit to Platincasino to be seen.</p>
<p>I ask for help</p>
