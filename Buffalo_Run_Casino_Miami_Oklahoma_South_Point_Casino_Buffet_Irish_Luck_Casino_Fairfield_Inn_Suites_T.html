<p>Nevada-based American casino and hotel company Caesars Entertainment has penned a deal with the ex-National Hockey League star Henrik Lundqvist. A retired professional goaltender of Swedish origin, Lundqvist will now become the official ambassador of Caesars Sportsbook and promote its launch in New York.</p>
<p>Lundqvist Teams Up With Caesars</p>
<p>The role of an official ambassador will see Lundqvist partake in various activations alongside Caesars. He will raise awareness of the operator’s offerings and will familiarize bettors with the many fan engagement opportunities they can get from participating in Caesars’ loyalty program, Caesars Rewards.</p>
<p>Through the program, New York punters who choose Caesars as their sportsbook of choice will be eligible for all kinds of benefits. By playing, participants can pile up Tier Credits and Reward Credits and then exchange them for various experiences. If players stock up enough credits, they can even trade them for a real-life meeting with Lundqvist himself.</p>
<p>Lundqvist commented that New York has always been a special place to him. He revealed that he always has exciting things happen when he’s there, which is why he is thrilled to collaborate with Caesars for the NY launch.</p>
<p>“Becoming a part of the Caesars Sportsbook team going forward is an exciting opportunity as I enter into my next chapter,” Lundqvist said.</p>
<p>Caesars is glad to not only foray into the NY market but also do so with the hockey star by its side. The operator’s chief marketing officer, Sharon Otterman, spoke on the matter:</p>
<p>“Henrik’s legacy in New York speaks for itself after the historic career he had for the Rangers and all of the great work he has done for the state. We’re thrilled to bring him aboard to help us engage with the passionate sports fans in New York as we offer them a sports betting experience worthy of the emperors they are.” Caesars CMO Sharon Otterman</p>
<p>Making a Big Bet on New York Sports Betting</p>
<p>Caesars is already setting up a strong foothold in New York by scoring various strategic partnerships and promoting its brand across the local bettors. The operator is partnering with the New York Rangers NHL franchise as well as the Knicks team from the National Basketball League.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook just launched in New York after it was approved by the state along with three other betting operators – DraftKings, FanDuel, and Rush Street Interactive. As the first operators taking bets since the launch of New York’s mobile sports betting on January 8, those four will have the responsible task of setting things up and creating a good image for the industry.</p>
