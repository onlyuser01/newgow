    <h1>Atlantic City Taj Casino Online Casino Free Spins No Deposit Dreams Casino Closest Casino Live Casin</h1>

<p>Good day, I have a pending withdrawal (it is not a bonus) which they do not want to deposit, I have already sent all the documentation that they request and they do not even want to deposit the money that I earn playing with my own money and I am not the only one in Mexico, There are many like me with the same situation.</p>
<p>Pd and documents do not only ask for INE, proof of address and account statement, they also ask for a photo of the physical card on both sides (and who uses a physical card these days and apart if I had it I would not send it), proof of deposits that they are in their name and I don't remember what else but the point is that they always come out with something new so as not to pay you. Even the accounts block and according to them the deposits of verified accounts are reflected in 1hr</p>
