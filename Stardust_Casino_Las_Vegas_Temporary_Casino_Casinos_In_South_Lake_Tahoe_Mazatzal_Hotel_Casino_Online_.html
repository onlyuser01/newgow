    <h1>Stardust Casino Las Vegas Temporary Casino Casinos In South Lake Tahoe Mazatzal Hotel Casino Online</h1>

<p>Thank you very much, 1win Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>After gathering and reviewing all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - multiple accounts or collusion and unsuccessful KYC.</p>
<p>Please note that it is not important whether you managed to withdraw any winnings from the casino in the past because online casinos are not obliged to make verification or perform additional account activity checks or inspections earlier than upon requesting a withdrawal or a withdrawal of a higher amount, depending on a particular casino. However, in this case, based on the above-stated, it is clear that the KYC/verification is impossible, and the disputed account did not pass the additional checks.</p>
<p>There are industry-standard rules saying that each player is allowed to use only his own payment method/funds in their account, and is obliged to verify all the payment methods used in their casino account for deposits and withdrawals in order to withdraw anything from their account.</p>
<p>It really does not matter if you have a secondhand phone or if anyone registered in the casino with the same device before since there is sufficient evidence confirming the fact we are talking either about multiple accounts used by 1 person or collusion (at least 2 players sharing their personal data/payment methods in their casino accounts, very likely playing together and/or abusing the casino's system in another way), which means the casino's Terms and Conditions were seriously breached.</p>
<p>Also if the site can't give my withdrawals then I am giving an option and suggestion to solve this problem to refund my deposits or else my wallet balance"</p>
<p>May be I don't know there is an id registerd in this same site</p>
<p>May be so many people are using this site</p>
<p>"How would I know that someone is playing 1win casino in my location</p>
<p>The provided details show that there are intersections between your disputed account and several other casino accounts in 1win Casino in personal data/payment method(s) that could not be used in other accounts without your knowledge, or alternatively, if those data belong to another person, it could not have been used in your disputed account by mistake or without the data owner's knowledge.</p>
