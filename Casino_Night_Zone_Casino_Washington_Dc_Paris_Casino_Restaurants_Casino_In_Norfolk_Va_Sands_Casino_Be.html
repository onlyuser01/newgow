<p>UK Plans to Reopen Non-essential Businesses in June</p>
<p>Following an announcement by the UK government on Tuesday, May 26, non-essential businesses are scheduled to reopen on June 15. Depending on the coronavirus (COVID-19) infection trends in the upcoming weeks, the government may also decide to push the date back if necessary. Given that positive or steady trends are observed, as of June 15, all non-essential businesses such as arcades, sports betting shops, fashion studios, car dealerships and other shops will be allowed to reopen. The non-essential businesses in the UK were ordered to shut down near the end of March. This was a part of the government’s methods to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country.</p>
<p>The reopening of non-essential businesses planned for June 15 is one of the planned steps for relaxing the measures in the country. Undoubtedly, such move will be beneficial for both the UK economy, but also for social life. Businesses which will restart operations must complete risk assessment but also consult with the relevant industry trade unions to ensure safety operations. Social distancing, regular sanitizing as well as complete disinfection of high-traffic areas and touch points are only a few of the health and safety rules.</p>
<p>The UK government also announced that planned hefty fines that may even include imprisonment for all businesses operating without observing the health and safety recommendations issued by the government.</p>
<p>Sports Bets to Restart Operations Just in Time for the Royal Ascot</p>
<p>Sports betting operators are also preparing to restart as of June 15. Keeping in mind that the Royal Ascot is starting as of June 16, the UK operators would find such relaxation of measures quite beneficial. Despite the launch behind closed doors, the Royal Ascot which is a five-day race, might as well be the contest that will mark the relaxation of the measures for sports in the country. A Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) spokesperson commented on the subject: “With racing returning soon, we welcome the fact that betting shops across the country will be able to open their doors again on 15 June.“</p>
<p>Alok Sharma, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy commented on the subject: “The high street sits at the heart of every community in the country. Enabling these businesses to open will be a critical step on the road to rebuilding our economy, and will support millions of jobs across the UK.” With that being said, records show that some 50,000 people were employed by sports betting stores in the country prior to the March shutdown.</p>
<p>The latest announcement by the UK government is showing the determination of officials to restart business and economy in the country. By implementing strict rules for social distancing and enhanced safety measures, one can only hope that the country will be able to move past the recent horrors and financial losses occasioned by the novel coronavirus.</p>
