<p>Oddin.gg has revealed a new partnership with Lion Gaming, which will focus on supplying the provider with esports betting solutions</p>
<p>Lion Gaming will benefit from Oddin’s extensive coverage of esports events and in-depth metrics that allow the company to translate esports data quickly, reliably, and actionably into bets.</p>
<p>This will allow Lion Gaming to significantly bolster its offer and solutions, which already include a dedicated sportsbook, esports betting platform, technology migration solutions, cryptocurrency opportunities, and more.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg is an important addition to this sprawling portfolio of technology and available business modules, with the company offering esports widgets to boost engagement with audiences, reliable esports odds feeds, and risk management.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Oddin.gg’s solutions have been successfully launched with a range of companies that are looking to break ground into the segment and establish a firm presence. Most recently, Oddin.gg signed an esports partnership with Stake.com, a well-established global sports betting community and website.</p>
<p>Growing Demand for Esports Means Having the Right Solutions</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Lion Gaming head of sports Jason Poprawa said that the alliance with the company was a chance to significantly improve the brand’s sportsbook platform:</p>
<p>By integrating Oddin.gg’s esports solutions, we are providing our partner operators and their players with an unrivaled gaming experience that combines seamless performance, a vast array of live esports markets, and the thrill of competitive esports. Lion Gaming head of sports Jason Poprawa</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, Lion Gaming can continue to deliver hard-hitting solutions that are intended to offer a 360-degree experience for partner brands. Meanwhile, Oddin.gg’s co-founder and managing director Marek Suchar was similarly pleased to see the partnership form, and added that he was excited to team up with Lion Gaming and provide them with reliable esports feeds and solutions.</p>
<p>The end goal, said Suchar, was to make sure that Lion Gaming would be in a position to the growing demand for esports betting and help elevate the overall experience for consumers and businesses. Oddin.gg has also worked with TrustDice and Loot.Bet to help the companies boost their own esports offering.</p>
