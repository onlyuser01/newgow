<p>The partnership is established in collaboration with GRID, which is a data platform that focuses on the provision of data solutions for the esports and games industry, presenting partners with data-powered data. GRID has previously worked with a number of prominent operators and companies interested in scaling their competitive gaming product, including Pinnacle.</p>
<p>Re-Play eSports Provides Players with More Entertainment</p>
<p>Re-Play eSports is a product dedicated to providing footage that is taken from the Champion of Champions Tour, a large-scale CS:GO event that brings professional teams into focus, and that will now be showcased through Inspired’s Virtual sportsbook and VPP platforms, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>To power Re-Play eSports’ in-game feeds and video feeds, Inspired Entertainment will rely on GRID’s powerful and advanced solutions. Thanks to Re-Play eSports, two teams will go head-to-head and play to win and advance, with players using the solution able to place their bets as they see fit. There will be a number of different markets to explore as well, including options such as Team to Win, Team to Get First Kill, Total Number of Survivors, and many more.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity Inspired CCO of Virtual Sports Steve Rogers said that the Virtual Sports vertical has been enjoying steady growth over the past 2-3 years. “Making eSports events available 24/7/365 across our certified Virtual Sports platforms is a uniquely exciting offer,” Rogers said, enthusiastic and optimistic about the future of the partnership.</p>
<p>Rolling out the Re-Play eSports game and solution with GRID is an opportunity to let fans experience the esports betting genre in a brand new way, he added. Meanwhile, GRID chief sales officer Mikael Westerling said that he was similarly excited about the opportunity.</p>
<p>CS:GO, A Cornerstone of the Esports Betting Experience</p>
<p>For starters, Westerling hailed CS:GO as a cornerstone electronic sports with a massive and growing player base. Inspired, he said, has built a product that is tailored to generational needs and successfully leverages the prominence of the esports genre.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Inspired and ensure the next wave of innovation in eSports betting is powered by official in-game data, providing the best fan experience for all players,” Westerling concluded.</p>
<p>GRID has been well-presented in the esports betting market and has been teaming up with other prominent operators to provide even more robust esports solutions, recently with BETER among others.</p>
