<p>PokerStars Celebrates 20th Anniversary, Launches New Tournaments</p>
<p>The online poker operator revealed that the tournaments will run from Sunday, November 14 through Saturday, December 4. Overall, there will be 20 tournaments, that will be “representing a year from 2001 to 2020,” according to PokerStars. Besides monetary prizes, winners of the tournaments will also enjoy special bonus prizes.</p>
<p>“Today we can provide more details of the Big 20 Rewind, with the full schedule of tournaments along with prize pool details which add up to $5.5 million,” reads a statement released by PokerStars</p>
<p>Those can include cars, luxury watches, as well as tournament tickets, and even luxury trips. PokerStars acknowledged that anyone who has played over the last 20 years will likely recognize some of the prizes. The online poker network ensured that there will be plenty of action for low stake and high stake players.</p>
<p>Multiple Tournaments Await Poker Fans between November 14 and December 4</p>
<p>On November 21, PokerStars launches one of the tournaments with the highest guaranteed prize pool. The 2006 Year of the Sunday Million tournament will run through November 22, offering a guaranteed prize pool of $1 million. The event will feature a $215 buy-in and besides a monetary prize, the winner will receive tickets to a major sports event final.</p>
<p>On November 23, three events dubbed the 2009 Year of SCOOP will be launched as a part of the Big 20 Rewind. Each event will feature a different buy-in but all three events start on November 23 and will run through November 24. The buy-in for the event featuring a $300,000 guarantee will be $109, while the event featuring a $700,000 guarantee prize pool will be with a $1050 buy-in.

The extra prize for those events is a 20th-anniversary luxury watches for all three winners.</p>
