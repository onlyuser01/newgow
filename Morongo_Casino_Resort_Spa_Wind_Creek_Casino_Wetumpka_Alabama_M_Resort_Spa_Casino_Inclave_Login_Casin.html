<p>NuxGame, a betting and gaming software provider has teamed up with fellow developer Galaxsys, an iGaming studio that is focusing on developing futuristic content and games for the sector. As a result, Galaxsys range of titles, including Crash, Keno Express, and Rocketon, will all become a part of NuxGame’s list of customers and clients. Not only that, but clients will have access to skill-based games such as Belote, Hokm and Pasur.</p>
<p>Bringing Fresh Content and Opportunities to iGaming</p>
<p>The concept of “skill-based games” is still subject to some intense regulatory scrutiny, but it’s one that is surely advancing in the igaming sector as a true game-changer to existing paradigms. Galaxsys is an impressive occurrence on the iGaming landscape as well as the company consists of 60 industry specialists who have come together to work on an innovative variety of titles that will completely transform the gameplay.</p>
<p>NuxGame is also happy with this arrangement as the deal will create brand-new opportunities to access Galaxsys’ games which are highly unique and bespoke products. NuxGame head of sales Bar Konson commented on this partnership:</p>
<p>NuxGame has now become synonymous with delivering high quality, entertaining games to our clients and Galaxsys aligns with this perfectly. The highly ambitious studio has seen unprecedented growth in recent months, and we are excited to start offering their titles to our clients and their global audiences. NuxGame head of sales Bar Konson</p>
<p>Galaxsys head of sales department Teni Grigoryan said that the partnership between Galaxsys and NuxGame is bound to be one of success. Both companies are motivated by eagerness to be among the best-known names in the industry, Grigoryan added.</p>
<p>Previously, NuxGame signed a partnership with Sumsub, a company that specializes in KYC and AML solutions for the iGaming industry. NuxGame has been continually enhancing its own product qualities and most recently deployed Optimove’s CRM capabilities to enhance its current product standing and help improve experiences across the board.</p>
