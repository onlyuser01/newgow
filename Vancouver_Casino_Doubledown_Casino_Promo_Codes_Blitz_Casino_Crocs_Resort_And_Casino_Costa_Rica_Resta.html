<p>PlayStar’s CEO, Per Hellberg, revealed that the launch in New Jersey marks a major milestone for the company. According to PlayStar’s CEO, the company will now leverage its products and GiG’s powerful platform to grow further. Hellberg said that although the entry marks only the start, the company is already seeing an increase in demand. In conclusion, he predicted further growth in New Jersey for PlayStar.</p>
<p>GiG’s Platform Enables Operators to Grow</p>
<p>Richard Brown, GiG’s CEO, added that the company has been impressed from the start of its collaboration with PlayStar. He outlined that PlayStar has an experienced dedicated team and that the company has an extremely strong product vision. Brown said that GiG is delighted to see its platform play a pivotal role in PlayStar’s launch in New Jersey. Last but not least, GiG’s CEO said that the new collaboration will bring benefits to the two companies.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted that our technology has played a central role in the New Jersey launch, and can be proud that, as PlayStar establishes themselves as a strong and innovative iGaming brand in the US, the success of our partnership will further demonstrate and drive our ambition to be the platform partner of choice for operators in regulated markets.” Richard Brown, CEO at GiG</p>
<p>GiG revealed that its platform is “built on nimble and agile technology” which is further boosted by its significant experience within the industry. What’s more, the platform enables operators to grow exponentially in different regulated jurisdictions around the globe.</p>
<p>Besides the launch of PlayStar in New Jersey, GiG recently announced it was granted authorization in Pennsylvania. The company said Wednesday that it received interim authorization from the gambling regulator in the state, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
