The gameplay of the new slot is filled with vibrant colors and quality sound effects while rewarding features grant a chance for big payouts.</p>

<p>A Fresh Addition to Push Gaming’s Growing Portfolio</p>
<p>George Fil, Push Gaming’s group managing director, shared his excitement about the company’s latest release. He explained that the game reaffirms Push Gaming’s commitment to offering engaging games to its growing customer base around the world. Fil added that the company continues to reach new customers by entering new markets. Finally, the group managing director explained: “Players have so much gameplay to enjoy and features to wield in 10 Swords, we’re confident they will enjoy an epic experience.”</p>
<p>“10 Swords exemplifies our commitment to provide varied and entertainment-focused games to our global audience.“ George Fil, group managing director at Push Gaming</p>
<p>The new title from Push Gaming offers an increasing prize ladder that can award players instant cash prizes. To trigger such an award, the players need to land a minimum of four sword symbols. This would grant them the minimum prize, but the bigger the number of swords, the bigger the prize. Ultimately, the maximum prize from this functionality is 5,000x, which is awarded when players land 10 swords.</p>
<p>In addition to the prize ladder, players of the new slot can also tap into free spins. To do so, at least three scatter symbols need to be landed on the reel, which unlocks a bonus free spins game. The developer explained that during this game mode, “additional scatters landed will transform the lowest paying symbol into swords and grant a retrigger boosting winning potential.” As with most new slot games, 10 Swords offers options for auto-play and speed play, granting users the possibility to enjoy a fast-paced slot action.</p>
