    <h1>Portsmouth Va Casino Tropicana Casino In Atlantic City Eureka Casino Resorts Casino New York Stake C</h1>

<p>Hello there. Seems like a messy situation you found yourself in and I'm sorry to see that. It could be really frustrating, especially if you feel that you haven't done anything wrong, right?</p>
<p>This casino is quite new and unfortunately not proven by time, therefore we have no reviews from players. Yet, as you can see, the safety index is pretty low. Please have a look at the article about fair and safe casinos and what do we recommend to players and casinos, and also how to choose a fair and trustworthy casino. You can do it easily just by clocking/taping on this link üëà.</p>
<p>"We believe online gambling should be fair. While this also requires players to act fairly and without malicious intent, it is mostly the casino's responsibility to make sure gambling remains fair and safe for players."</p>
<p>"'Fair and safe casinos' are those that meet all criteria for 'fair casinos' and have also implemented measures that prevent players from accidentally doing something against the rules or their own best interests."</p>
<p>In my opinion, you have done the right thing to reach out to our complaint team, they will do their best to help you out. Feel free to send any updates, here or add it to your complaint of course. We always advice players to fully cooperate with the casino, as it is the best way to come to the best possible ending.</p>
<p>So you have some answer to your emails from the support, yes? You said that you have not played with any bonuses. If you have any kind of proof of course send it to the complaint team, so they can start to investigate what could've happened. Please let us know if you have any news regarding this issue üôè.</p>
