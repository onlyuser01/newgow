<p>The world leader in entertainment offering innovative gaming content and solutions, Zitro Games, announced it achieved a major milestone within its environmental sustainability strategy. The company said on Wednesday that it reduced its carbon footprint by 80% when compared to last year.</p>
<p>To achieve the result, Zitro has taken new measures that helped offset its carbon footprint. Moreover, the company implemented an action plan which contributed positively to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Boosting its sustainability efforts, Zitro joined forces with vendors that use environmentally friendly materials during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>In a statement dated June 8, 2022, Ortiz Viveiros, Zitro's founder, acknowledged the importance of the global climate crisis. He said: "As a company, we have a corporate social responsibility and at Zitro we always try to be one step ahead."</p>
<p>Viveiros outlined that implementing environmentally-friendly policies is a part of Zitro's philosophy. At the same time, he said that the company remains fully committed to "sustainable sourcing and prioritize suppliers that engaged with emissions-improvement efforts." Additionally, Viveiros urged other companies to focus on the sustainable development of their business and promote environmentally friendly initiatives. In conclusion, Zitro's founder said: "Together we can offset our footprint and make a positive difference."</p>

<p>As a part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, Zitro Laboratory created and implemented sustainable policies that help reduce the ecological impact. The company explained that those policies included "internal planning of energy consumption in the framework of product development, as well as the sourcing of raw materials from local suppliers for the manufacture of its products, which results in savings in energy used for transportation logistics, considerably reducing the carbon footprint."</p>
