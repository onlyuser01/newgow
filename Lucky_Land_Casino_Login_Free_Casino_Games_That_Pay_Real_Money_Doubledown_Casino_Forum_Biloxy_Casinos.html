<p>Logan Storley to Get Himself Back in the Spotlight</p>
<p>Logan Storley is 14-2 overall with a 9-2 record in Bellator MMA. Both of his losses happened to Yaroslav Amosov, who’s considered to be the very best welterweight fighter outside the UFC. The last time it happened was in February when the two went toe-to-toe in a battle for the Bellator World Championship.</p>
<p>Storley lost the fight by unanimous decision after 25 minutes of intense fighting. He did get beaten up by the Ukrainian fighter, but he showed the world he’s as tough as it gets.</p>
<p>He’s without a single loss inside the distance, which is really a big achievement considering that he’s fought some great finishers so far. Apart from Amosov who’s got a finish rate of 70.37%, he also fought (and won) against Joaquin Buckley (75.00%), Michael Page (76.19%), and Neiman Gracie (83.33%).</p>
<p>Brennan Ward Looking for That Big Leap Forward</p>
<p>Brennan Ward is a 35-year-old who’s got a 17-6 record in his professional MMA career. He’s 13-6 in Bellator, a promotion he joined almost 11 years ago. Ward’s been fighting in Bellator for a long time, even getting a shot at the middleweight title once. However, it happened back in 2014, and since, he hasn’t achieved much.</p>
<p>We could see him get a chance to fight for the welterweight title in the future, but for that, he needs to beat Storley. The problem is that this is arguably the toughest opponent he’s ever faced. On the bright side, Ward is on a roll with three straight KO/TKO wins. However, all of those happened against fighters who are nowhere near Storley in terms of fighting prowess.</p>
<p>Logan Storley vs. Brennan Ward Prediction</p>
<p>Logan Storley is better than Brennan Ward in every single aspect of mixed martial arts. Ward might be a great finisher, but the fact that Storley’s never been finished means that such a scenario is unlikely to play out this coming Friday. Instead, we think the most likely outcome is a win for Storley by decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Logan Storley to win</p>
