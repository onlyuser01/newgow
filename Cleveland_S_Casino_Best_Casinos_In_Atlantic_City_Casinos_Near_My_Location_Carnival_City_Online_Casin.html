    <h1>Cleveland S Casino Best Casinos In Atlantic City Casinos Near My Location Carnival City Online Casin</h1>

<p>Americas Cardroom has wrapped up one of its most-anticipated and ballyhooed small stake tournaments, which proved a success for players with whopping prize pools</p>
<p>The event, The Mini Online Super Series, was played via the card room’s dedicated platform website, and it beat the original $6.4 million prize purse, reaching $7.1 million setting a new record for the event.</p>
<p>Chris Moneymaker, a long-time Americas Cardroom team member and professional player legendary for his success in a World Series of Online Poker Main Event for which he qualified and won after an online tournament, hailed the recent success of the buy-in tourney series.</p>
<p>“And it’s just part of our effort to create great variety this year on our tourney schedule for lower and mid-stakes players,” Moneymaker said teasing about the many excellent events and opportunities that are coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>Mystery Bounty and Room for Improvement</p>
<p>The series featured the first Mystery Bounty tournament which had a $22 buy-in and a guaranteed $500,000. The prize pool quickly increased to $610,000 and gathered 30,506 entries on Day 1 already.</p>
<p>Now the Mini Online Super Series did not do as well as the company had hoped for but Americas Cardroom is determined to continue pushing it, Moneymaker said. Small-stake events naturally have a slightly lower turnover as well, especially when compared to events such as The Venom, for example.</p>
<p>In competitive terms, however, even the Mini Online Super Series is already offering impressive sums compared to most other poker events around the world, especially those that too seek to introduce small buy-ins.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Americas Cardroom released a video documentary about the company’s event in Vietnam that took place in March.</p>
