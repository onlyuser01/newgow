    <h1>Casino In Central City Resort And Casino Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Pit Boss Casino Grand Casino Las</h1>

<p>At first everything was fine with casumo, they registered me, they took data from me, finally I started to deposit with a visa. They had no problem receiving and receiving deposits from my credit card. Then I was "lucky" to win and that's where the problems started. They blocked my account until I sent documents. Send all the required documents, from my ID to the letter with movements from my checking account. (An abuse). I am told that in 24 hours the resolution of the case will be. They never wrote to me again.</p>
<p>Finally they only use excuses to withhold payments. In the meantime I was warned that I could only withdraw money through ewallet, as I was never warned before depositing. Ne netller warn me that I can only make withdrawals of US $ 160 per day. So you will understand that taking 33,000 euros out of 160 a day ... is impossible.</p>
<p>It is a series of abuse and misinformation, while I lost in their game rooms my account, my money, and my accounts were never questioned. Since the day I won the withdrawals were blocked, once I had won, they reported that I cannot take everything out and what can I take out little by little? Lack of transparency, when entering the casino should be the notice that it is prohibited to win, because they delay payments and they pay you exhaustion. I remain discriminated against and in a xenophobic attitude because Hispanic, in one of the chat rooms, was simply told "we don't speak Spanish here."</p>
<p>When a casino that claims to be big must be prepared to make big payments, and not cause problems and delay the matter.</p>
<p>Finally, seeing myself frustrated, excluded, swindled and with nothing else to do in the face of abuse, I lost all my money in one afternoon, a bad casino that doesn't like players, only losers. While I lost there was no problem until they had to pay. It is a real one, a real casino receives and pays accordingly. Absolutely not recommended.</p>
