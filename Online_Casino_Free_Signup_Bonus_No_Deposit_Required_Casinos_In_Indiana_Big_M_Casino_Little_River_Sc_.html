    <h1>Online Casino Free Signup Bonus No Deposit Required Casinos In Indiana Big M Casino Little River Sc</h1>

<p>Hello, the last communication with the casino took place yesterday and it was based on the principle (You keep sending the same documents), which is not true.</p>
<p>The ID card was accepted, but the address was not confirmed.</p>
<p>I have already sent them various documents, a telephone bill, a TV bill, even a bank transfer with an employment contract, a bank statement confirming that I am the owner and they confirm my address, everything I can, I had an old gas bill which they rejected, but I rent and I don't have it another .</p>
<p>I just can't send them the document to please them - the case has been going on for 12 days, but they reject it after 1-2 days at most, so I've had a lot of attempts.</p>
<p>They have written that they do not accept transfers. I understand, so I sent them invoices for the Internet / TV / telephone because that's all I have, the lease agreement is from 6 months ago, so I can't give it to them and it keeps being rejected.</p>
<p>What's more, communicating with this chat is a nightmare because they don't write specifically what doesn't fit, you just send the same text over and over again, and when I ask what document I should send, the answer is something like, in the panel see what you must upload ? It must be a bank statement. which they also got.</p>
