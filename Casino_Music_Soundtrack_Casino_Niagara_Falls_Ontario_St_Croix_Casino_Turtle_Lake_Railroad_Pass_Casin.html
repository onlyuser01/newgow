<p>Wazdan has confirmed that it has launched its portfolio of games with GoldBet.it, a prominent operator of online casino products in the Italian market. The selection of games has been available to players since September 20, but Wazdan and Goldbet have only revealed the news now.</p>
<p>The partnership has been well-considered on both ends as Wazdan is an established supplier of slots and other casino products whereas Goldbet operates a diverse range of experiences for its players, including slots – but also poker, bingo, and live games. The platform even supports a dedicated sports betting platform.</p>
<p>Wazdan Chief Commercial Officer Andrzej Hyla was similarly pleased with this opportunity and added that the company was truly thrilled to be teaming up with Goldbet.io and presenting it with its array of exceptional games. Hyla hailed his company’s ability to stay at the cutting edge of innovation and said that Italian players will now benefit from this through Goldbet.it.</p>
<p>"Wazdan has always been at the forefront of innovation, and this partnership allows us to share our passion for cutting-edge gaming experiences with Italian players," Hyla explained. Of</p>
<p>As a result of this partnership, players at Goldbet.it will have access to some of Wazdan’s most promising and thrilling titles, including Black Hawk Deluxe, 9 Lions, Hot 777 Deluxe, Power of Gods: Medusa, and more. Wazdan has won numerous distinctions owing to these games, and it has been recognized in categories such as Mobile Supplier and Software Supplier going to further show the company’s commitment to building outstanding products. This is not the first time that Wazdan has expanded in Italy.</p>
<p>The company is present in the market already with NetBet, one of the arguably most prominent brands in the country as part of a partnership that was also signed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Recently, Wazdan has outlined a very busy schedule for itself in the fourth quarter of the year, with the company planning to launch with a number of new titles, including Book of Faith, 20Coins, and 9 Bells among other. The company has confirmed that it is looking to significantly increase its network promotions and build upon a strong portfolio of solutions that help engage players.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Wazdan also launched with PepperMill Casino in Belgium, continuing its global march towards expansion, with a particular focus on regulated European markets.</p>
