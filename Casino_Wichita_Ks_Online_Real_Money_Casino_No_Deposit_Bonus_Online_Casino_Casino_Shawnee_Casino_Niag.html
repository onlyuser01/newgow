<p>Danske Spil, Denmark’s national lottery operator, has renewed its partnership with the leading sports betting content and tech supplier OpenBet. As a result, the latter will continue to power Danske Spil’s Oddset brand with its critically-acclaimed solutions.</p>
<p>OpenBet and Danske Spil Renew Agreement</p>
<p>Thanks to the new agreement, OpenBet will continue powering Danske Spil’s sports betting brand with content and solutions. As per the deal, the supplier will support both Oddset’s online sports betting platform and its 2,700 sports betting terminals in the country.</p>
<p>The partnership has been extended for several years and will see the B2B supplier work with the Danish operator through 2025. According to the agreement, this deal can be further extended by an extra year.</p>
<p>This extension comes just in time for this winter’s World Cup tournament. OpenBet and Oddset will work together on devising new plans to attract sports bettors and boost Danske Spil’s customer acquisition strategy. Oddset will, therefore, boost its platform with new features and will get access to OpenBet’s premium content offering powered by SportCast. The latter includes the critically-acclaimed BetBuilder solution and its pre-canned version.</p>
<p>The new deal will boost Danske Spil’s appeal and will cement OpenBet as a leading lottery and sports betting provider. The company is known for powering multiple World Lottery Association members and is the go-to provider for companies that wish to boost their offerings.</p>
<p>Danske Spil Is Happy with OpenBet’s Work</p>
<p>Danske Spil’s chief executive officer, Karsten Fogh Holanng, called OpenBet a “valued partner” and admitted that his team has been impressed with the provider’s hard work. OpenBet has worked with the Danish operator for nine years now, helping the company evolve its online and retail offerings. Holanng said that he is excited to extend the agreement with the supplier and provide local sports fans with products that are both exciting and safe.</p>
<p>OpenBet has raised the game and we are looking forward to offering the widest range of products and markets to our loyal customer base. Karsten Fogh Holanng, CEO, Danske Spil</p>
<p>OpenBet’s chief product officer, Nikos Konstakis, also shared his thoughts. He said that OpenBet feels honored to continue supplying Danske Spil with platform tech, content and services. Konstakis noted that the Danish market is highly competitive but OpenBet will nevertheless help Oddset differentiate itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>Crucially, Danske Spil’s decision to trust OpenBet for a further three years reiterates why we are the leading sportsbook provider for WLA members. We are more determined than ever to work alongside lotteries to deliver quality and robust sports betting products and services. Nikos Konstakis, CPO, OpenBet</p>
