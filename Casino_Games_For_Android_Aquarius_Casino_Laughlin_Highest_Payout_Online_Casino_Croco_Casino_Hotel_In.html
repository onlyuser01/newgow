    <h1>Casino Games For Android Aquarius Casino Laughlin Highest Payout Online Casino Croco Casino Hotel In</h1>

<p>The first and largest privately-owned casino in Rhode Island will receive a massive tweak and become even bigger. On Thursday, union leaders were joined by state officials from the governor on down for an expansion of the Bally’s Twin River Casino Resort, located in Lincoln. The expansion is set to cost around $100 million.</p>
<p>This expansion, which is mandated in the law that approved a new casino contract and a 20-year state lottery, will result in a 40,000-square-foot addition to the gambling floor and a spa center of 10,000 square feet, as well as an area which is referred to as enhanced food hall area.</p>
<p>Twenty Construction Trades Will Be Involved</p>
<p>Paul Juliano, Bally’s Corporation Vice President of Operations, stated that the ceremony marks the start of the new $100-million Rhode Island investment and that the company is thrilled to be in a project that is set to involve around 20 construction trades in the next one year to 14 months. Bally’s Corporation is the new operating name of the partnership between Twin River and IGT.</p>
<p>One thing that Juliano put a major emphasis on is the fact that while the expansion takes place, the casino will remain operational. He also added that these improvements will strengthen the position that the resort has now in Rhode Island and thus, continue to play a massive role in the state’s economic prosperity.</p>
<p>In addition to the governor and the legislative leaders, some of the guests who attended were Michael Sabitoni, Rhode Island Building &amp; Construction Trades Council’s president, and George Nee, the president of the AFL-CIO. The general contractor will be Suffolk Construction.</p>
<p>Sabitoni stated that all parties included in the project celebrate the fact that hundreds of members of more than 20 unions will participate in the modernization and expansion of the casino.</p>
<p>Bally’s Twin River Will Have a Lot to Offer</p>
<p>The two Twin River casinos in Rhode Island, as well as the casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton, now offer Bally’s cards, dice, table game layouts and gaming chips because Bally’s appended its name to these facilities.</p>
<p>In Lincoln specifically, plenty of things are planned. The additional 40,000 square feet of gambling space to the first floor will allow gambling to take place on just one floor, rather than two. In doing so, the second floor will be free for extra offering in entertainment. A Korean-style spa spanning 14,000 square feet, improved lighting and air circulation, greater separation between the smoking and non-smoking area, more public restrooms, bar areas, an additional food hall and a modernized casino space with tons of design upgrades and better amenities will also be featured.</p>
