<p>Rivalry, an international sports betting, and media company announced that it will be adding mobile e-sports betting to its list of wagering services. This segment is considered to be among the fastest-growing segments in the betting industry and Rivalry has made sure that it stays ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>The Ecosystem Is Perfect for Mobile Gaming According to Rivalry CEO</p>
<p>While speaking about the newest addition, the CEO and co-founder of Rivalry, Steven Salz, stated that mobile gaming is “soaring in popularity around the world.”</p>
<p>The sportsbook believes that mobile e-sports games will be most played and most bet on in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Salz expanded on the prediction by saying that not everyone has a desktop device or a console to play the top games, but almost everyone has a mobile phone and that is what makes the ecosystem perfect for mobile gaming.</p>
<p>He ended by saying that Rivalry always aims to bring innovative products to the market in advance. Thanks to that approach, the sportsbook has been able to establish massive brand engagement among Generation Z bettors and millennials.</p>
<p>Recently, Rivalry completed a massive milestone and was able to expand to Oceania as it received a license to operate sports betting products in Australia. Salz commented on the development by saying that expanding across regulated markets in the world is of huge importance to Rivalry and the Australian license is something that everyone at Rivalry is extremely happy about.</p>
<p>There Are over 2.2 Billion Active Mobile Gamers in the World</p>
<p>Of course, Rivalry’s claims that mobile gaming is the future did not come out of the blue. Statistics show that at the moment, there are over 2.2 billion mobile gamers and estimates suggest that by 2025, half of the global population will play mobile games.</p>
<p>Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia experience above-average growth, even though affordability is a big concern there. In India, Battlegrounds Mobile India was downloaded 50 million times in the first month after its release.</p>
<p>Rivalry Limited is owned by Rivalry Corp., a sports betting and media company that has a global team in more than countries. The company obtained an Isle of Man license in 2018 and throughout the years, it created a variety of unique products.</p>
<p>Apart from gaining a license in Australia, Rivalry was also among the first gambling companies to be awarded an Ontario license. After the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario awarded Rivalry its license, Salz stated that it is a special privilege for Rivalry to be offering its services in Ontario due to the fact that the company is based in Toronto. The legal online gambling market in Ontario is set to launch on April 4 and until then, all operators that are in the process of obtaining a license are required to cease all activities.</p>
