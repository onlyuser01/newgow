<p>In April, Tekkorp Capital announced it would expand its foothold on the Australian market with a brand new sports betting venture. Now, the same digital investment and advisory group has sealed a fresh partnership agreement with the virtual league SimWin Sports. According to the terms of the contract, Tekkorp Capital will support SimWin’s product, business development, marketing, and corporate strategy in the digital gaming realm.</p>
<p>Just in Time for the Debut Season</p>
<p>SimWin Sports is the pioneer digital sports league offering fans, players, and bettors the chance to play, watch, make predictions, and collect nonstop in the metaverse. Their main goal is to launch the next-gen of sports gaming right in the metaverse while fueling the exciting sports betting and fantasy sports action 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>The new partnership with Tekkorp Capital was announced just prior to the league making its seasonal debut. SimWin Sports will provide daily betting and fantasy sports options by simulating a series of contests in the metaverse. All trainers, teams, and players are represented by non-fungible tokens ( NFTs). The NFTs belong to several sports legends and celebrities including 12-time All-Star and a nine-time member of the All-NBA First Team Magic Johnson and NFL legend Jerry Rice with multiple playoffs and Super Bowl records. SimWin Sports would launch with a league of 32 teams, with big plans to further grow in soccer, basketball and other sports.</p>
<p>SimWin’s chief executive officer David J. Ortiz spoke about fantasy sports and real money gambling as being “the largest entertainment sector on earth.” He added that these sectors manage to record this success in spite of the fact that sport is only available 40% of the time. Ortiz further explained that virtual sports leagues will manage to fill the gaps and allow players to be engaged nonstop.</p>
<p>Critical Pillar for SimWin Sports</p>
<p>Ortiz also spoke about the way “season-long and daily fantasy” sports together with in-play sports wagering options represent a “critical pillar” part of their commercial offerings. This comes to explain the strategic agreement sealed with Tekkorp Capital. The company will use its expert advisors to help promote the growth of the league while collaborating with SimWin’s founders.</p>
<p>The list includes brilliant minds in the industry, with names like DraftKing’s former chief marketing officer Tom Goedde along with other seasoned veterans like Crispin Nieboer, the former CEO for William Hill’s online division, or PokerStar’s executive Tarvi Randver worth mentioning. Ortiz further explained that the new agreement will have some of the “sharpest minds in the real-money gaming industry” work on the league’s operations structure and commercial planning. In return, this should help them obtain the right framework needed to promote and guarantee their success. SimWin’s CEO also chief described Tekkorp’s executives as excellent operators part of some of the most iconic companies in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Tekkorp’s president Robin Chhabra explained they were initially “intrigued, and then amazed” by the impressive scale and vision of what SimWin is working on, adding Tekkorp was extremely excited to be a part of the project.</p>
