    <h1>Cashman Casino Free Casinos In Jackson Mississippi Bay Mills Resort Casino Brimley Mi Council Bluffs</h1>

<p>I’ve had issues with High Noon Casino in the recent past kicking me offline during the middle of me completing an add-on that I purchased for $2.50. I complained and was told to use Chrome not Safari. I did this and it still continued. I took a break after arguing with them over and over. This weekend I decided to try again and bought in on the Wkend Cash Bandits Tournament. I made a 20$ deposit knowing this would get me 8 add ons at $2.50 a piece. This got me to 126th place. I figured another 20$ ‘8’ more add ins would put me in the top 10. I deposit 20 more and begin while counting my plays cautiously. It kicks me off during one of the 4 Add ons I had made. I should have 4 renaming. I look at my balance and it says $7.50 that wasnt correct! I chat and explain and they told me I played 6 times. I was very frustrated because I knew that wasn’t true somehow the game is charging me with unplayed add ons. I was charged for 4 which means that’s one add on that I’ll not have now and that are so precious this close to being in the lead. I got nowhere with chat service so I got back In the tournament and figured I’d play my last 3 ‘suppose to be 4’ add ons. During my 1st add on it kicked me off twice and I noticed to resume the current game I was in the middle of it made me push add on again then took me back to the spot I was at when it kicked me off. I thought ‘I bet that’s gonna charge me again’, even said so to my girlfriend next to me. I finished my add on and played again.. this was my 2nd add on since speaking with chat. This would leave me with 2 more after completing it. I do so and I’m ranked 14th. AWESOME my calculations were bright I was almost in the top 10 ‘ even after one add on was taken from me. So I knew I was in the clear for hopefully 1st place because I still had 2 add ons left. So I push add on yo start my 3rd game since talking with chat.. and what did I see ?!… OUT OF FUNDS. I couldn’t believe my eyes I was livid. This was going to cost me my win after 2 days of playing and 40$ invested I can’t get in the top 10 because I got jipped $7.50 ‘3 add ons’ because their system kicked me off in the middle of my games 3 times which caused me to have to push add on again just to continue my game where I left off before it kicked me off. Each time it charged me again. I immediately wrote chat and explained what happened! They insisted I played 9 times which WAS NOT TRUE and I explained in detail my cautious counting and alertness on the amount of add ons/money I had and used because it was so valuable. They took what was going to give me a $250 win and tried to offer me a $10 chip in its place.! I asked them can I play my 3 more add ons that were taken from me? He said not with this chip so I said NO! I want my $7.50 software took from me not to mention the winning pot that I now was not going to get after such a time consuming effort and $40 in deposits to make myself able to achieve. He said I’m sorry but there isn’t anyone here to speak to someone will contact you tomorrow. I said ‘ NO GOOD’ by then I’ll have lost my position and the tournament will have ended. I couldn’t believe how unprofessional they were especially after my prior negative experiences with their tournaments. So… now it is the following day, I WASN’T Able to finish my remaining 3add ons, and nobody has contacted me about the situation as promised. This Casino is VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and I will NEVER participate in their fixed / set up fake tournaments. I’d suggest the same if you’re considering it. Thank</p>
