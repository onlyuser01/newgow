    <h1>Evansville Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Usa Ncl Casino At Sea Encore Casino Restaurants Troplv Cas</h1>

<p>Hello Giuggi.</p>
<p>I understand your position, but in a situation like yours, there is very little what we can do.</p>
<p>First of all, casinos are checking the players when they make a withdrawal, not before because they save the time of their people; thus, it is cheaper. So it is no coincidence, that's common practice.</p>
<p>Now imagine the situation that you live in the family with your parents and you also have an adult kid in one household. You find a good casino, which offers a great welcome bonus. This bonus is truly amazing, but you can take it only once. Then imagine that you got an idea to create the account for your parents/wife/kid and suddenly you have 5 chances to convert this bonus. And because the bonus is something like a paid commercial (the casino is giving you something for free to convince you that they are the best casino for you - so it is like an investment into future profits) This system is failing if you have a chance to use the bonus multiple times.</p>
<p>And because there are people who are following this idea, the rule - one bonus per IP/household exists.</p>
<p>And now, back to your problem:</p>
<p>Because you and your wife are living in the same address, nobody knows if it was really she, who was playing. If they make an exception for you, then the many other people will want the same exception and between them would also be somebody who will abuse it.</p>
<p>Therefore there is no dialogue in these cases, and this rule is very strict.</p>
<p>The key question here is: did you both claim the welcome bonus?</p>
