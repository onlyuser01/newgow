    <h1>Casino Bangor Maine Palms Casino Resort Reviews Mohegan Sun Casino Online Santan Mountain Casino Pho</h1>

<p>Greentube continues to methodically expand its reach in the United States. The Novomatic Digital Gaming and Entertainment division has doubled up on its ambitions for the market and has struck an important deal with BetMGM, a leading operator in New Jersey, and the US iGaming and sports gambling market. Greentube’s forays in the US market may be fairly new, but the company has been around for 25 years.</p>
<p>BetMGM Welcomes Greentube Portfolio in NJ</p>
<p>The new partnership will enable Greentube to deliver its distinct portfolio of games, including Apollo God of the Sun, Diamond Cash, and Prized Panda to BetMGM customers and across the United States as the two companies work on other launches as well.</p>
<p>Greentube made the first stride in the United States market back in 2021 and has been rapidly picking up the pace of expansion ever since. At the beginning of the year, Greentube secured an entry into Michigan, another promising and fastly-developing iGaming market in the country.</p>
<p>Greentube has been regulated in the United States for more than a year now and it is part of the New Jersey iGaming ecosystem from the very start. The present partnership makes a lot of sense for the company which is looking to expand with prominent brands.</p>
<p>As a result, players at Borgata Casino, Party Casino, and BetMGM Casino in the Garden State will now be able to access the portfolio and interact with the company’s unique titles.</p>
<p>Greentube is combining a mix of innovative designing techniques with conventional wisdom to make its games highly popular, easy to play, and rewarding. Speaking about this opportunity, Greentube commercial director David Bolas said:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be launching with such a prominent operator as BetMGM and really appreciate the importance of this partnership as it will see our content added to their leading brands. It’s another very important step for us in the U.S. market where we have had a fantastic start and we are already preparing ourselves for our next launch in the state of Michigan.” Greentube commercial director David Bolas</p>
<p>Greentube Games to Be a Hit with BetMGM Players</p>
<p>BetMGM director of gaming Oliver Barlett joined the conversation and praised the company’s extensive presence in the iGaming sector, commending the more than two decades of hard work Greentube has been putting to innovate the industry.</p>
<p>BetMGM is confident that by teaming up with Greentube the company is demonstrating its commitment to players and bringing the best possible iGaming products. Barlett cited Diamond Cash as one of the most immersive and engaging options for players by the platform that will definitely strike home with BetMGM’s players.</p>
