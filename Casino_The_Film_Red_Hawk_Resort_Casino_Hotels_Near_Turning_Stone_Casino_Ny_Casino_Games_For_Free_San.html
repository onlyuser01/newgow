    <h1>Casino The Film Red Hawk Resort Casino Hotels Near Turning Stone Casino Ny Casino Games For Free San</h1>

<p>Hi thank you for you interest. I wad trying get help over the year in lot's ot places but I have not been successful.</p>
<p>I have never played for bonus all the winings was from my deposits to account. Yes my account was verified and I did login through the Phantom wallet to their side.</p>
<p>My account was suspended on 26.12.2022 the game they have told me did have a bug and high volatility was still live 6 days after they suspended my account. I have screenshots as proof.</p>
<p>It was long year I have never give up but I am just trying to post it on different places so I may eventually get help from someone.</p>
<p>I did officially contacted</p>
<p>Curacao government</p>
<p>Curacao gaming commission</p>
<p>Certiria their licence provider</p>
<p>Solcasino.io email support</p>
<p>Curacao Law firm</p>
<p>No one from above did come back to me.</p>
<p>I have been a gambler around 4 years ago Gamblestop did help me so I could not play anymore games online. Last year was really successful for me my company was in good shape , my personal wealth in good shape. I don't know why I did enter this website I just want try my luck.</p>
<p>I have end up winning big which was always my dream.</p>
<p>When they have took live changing opportunity from me. Something just clicked in my head I did knew they scammers but I couldn't help and wanted to win that money. I have gamle and lost another 150 000$ on new account they have advised me to open. Exactly 1 year now . I am broken and going for bankruptcy . It is really annoying they can play like that with people's lives.</p>
<p>I knew it was my mistake to carry on playing when all this happened but I just couldn't help it addiction in gambling is bad thing. I did learn from my mistakes . Now I do focus on rebuilding my life .</p>
<p>I will never let go what happened soon or later I will find someone who will help and get them owners of Solcasino.io deserve.</p>
