    <h1>Boyd Casinos Las Vegas Casino South Side Casino Las Vegas Nevada Catskill Resort Casino Rivers Casin</h1>

<p>On the 21st December 2020 I tried to make a withdrawal of $5500 - for more than a month the money just kept bouncing back to my playing account. I contacted LiveChat several times - they promised to make a manual withdrawal for me - and still, many times the money just kept going back to my playing account.</p>
<p>At last on 28th January 2021 they made another manual withdrawal for me for $5500 - ever since I've been waiting and waiting, no money on my bank account. I contacted them today again and was told that $1754 was sent to my bank account on 6th February. I tried to find out - what about the rest? No information whatsoever, no need to talk to a supervisor as he/she will not be able to give me more information.</p>
<p>I did say to them that this casino practice is absolutely NOT acceptable.</p>
<p>Is there any way you can help me to recover my winning?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Gabriella</p>
