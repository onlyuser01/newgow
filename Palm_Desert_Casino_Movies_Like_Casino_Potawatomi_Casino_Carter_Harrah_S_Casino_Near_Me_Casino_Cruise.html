<p>Allegiant Adding Service to Las Vegas for NFL Raiders Games</p>

<p>Allegiant is making it easier for away team fans to check out the NFL Las Vegas Raiders’ home in Southern Nevada, just west of the Strip.</p>

<p>Allegiant is headquartered in Summerlin and is one of the 15 largest airlines in North America. The airline acquired the naming rights to the Raiders stadium in 2019 when it agreed to pay $25 million a year to the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, which owns the $1.9 billion, 65,000-seat facility, in exchange for the sponsorship. The Las Vegas Stadium Authority is controlled by the Clark County government.</p>
<p>Allegiant Stadium is the home of the Las Vegas Raiders, but Allegiant isn’t picking sides in the team’s games. The airline announced this week that it’s adding temporary flights between Las Vegas and cities coming to Southern Nevada in the coming weeks to play the Raiders.</p>
<p>Allegiant officials say they will increase service between Las Vegas and Pittsburgh this weekend in anticipation of the Steelers coming to town. The airline will also increase Las Vegas service with Kansas City in November ahead of the Chiefs coming to Sin City.</p>
<p>Visitors Welcome</p>
<p>Allegiant says the temporary increase in service to and from Las Vegas to the select NFL cities will allow visiting fans to more conveniently travel to Nevada.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to offer these specialty flights to the most passionate fan bases in the league,” said Drew Wells, Allegiant senior vice president and chief revenue officer. “Every year, we look for opportunities to bring NFL fans to premier vacation destinations to see their teams play. These flights are popular with our customers, and we expect them to sell out well in advance of the games.”</p>
<p>The Raiders host the Steelers on September 24 and the Chiefs on November 26. With Las Vegas also home to large Cowboys and Chargers fan bases, Allegiant is also temporarily increasing service to Los Angeles for their October 16 Monday Night Football showdown.</p>
<p>For the Steelers and Chiefs games at Allegiant Stadium, the airline is offering fans one-stop shopping with airline tickets, two-night hotel stays, and game tickets bundled into a package.</p>
<p>The Steelers “Football Fan Packages” include roundtrip airfare from Pittsburgh, a carry-on and checked bag, priority boarding, a standard seat at Allegiant Stadium, and the choice of a three-star and up casino hotel room for two nights.</p>
<p>Season Kickoff</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders kicked off the regular season with a 17-16 win over the Broncos in Denver. The Silver &amp; Black followed that win up with a disappointing performance in Buffalo, where the Bills dominated the Raiders, 38-10.</p>
<p>Expectations aren’t exactly high for Las Vegas. After two weeks, DraftKings has the Raiders at 100/1 to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are favored to win the AFC West at 1/3. The Chargers are at 4/1, and the Raiders are longer at 10/1. The Raiders’ regular season over/under win total is just 7.5 games.</p>
