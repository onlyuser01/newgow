<p>Big lottery wins bring excitement to those who are lucky enough to have them. Well, sometimes purchasing more than one ticket with the same numbers can help lottery players get a big prize even from a game with a four-digit grand prize.</p>
<p>This is precisely the case of Fekru Hirpo, an Alexandria, Virginia resident that purchased 20 tickets from the same game, using the same numbers. This bold move resulted in the lucky man winning a total of $100,000 from a game with a grand prize of $5,000.</p>
<p>Most lottery players pick different numbers when betting or in some cases, have a favorite set of numbers that are always used along with a second, random set. Rarely, do lottery players use the same numbers for multiple tickets, but the Alexandria man did exactly this.</p>
<p>Hirpo used the same four-digit combination of 2-5-2-7 for a total of 20 tickets for the same game, Virginia Lottery’s Pick 4. As a result, each of the winning tickets got him a grand prize of $5,000, taking the total winnings he secured to a staggering $100,000.</p>
<p>Something Told the Lucky Player to Purchase 20 Tickets</p>
<p>Virginia Lottery’s drawings for Pick 4 are daily at 1:59 PM and 11 PM. The game of $1 grants players a chance to win a top prize of $5,000 by matching all four numbers in the exact order. The chance to match the numbers is 1 in 10,000, explains the Virginia Lottery.</p>
<p>It was last week when the Virginia Lottery confirmed Hirpo’s win from Pick 4. The lucky man won the draw on March 8 after purchasing the tickets from Four Mile Run Shell at 4060 South Four Mile Run Drive in Arlington. The Alexandria resident did not reveal what he plans to do with the $100,000 he won. Hirpo admitted that he doesn’t usually use the same numbers for such many identical tickets but said that for the drawing, “something just told him to do it.”</p>
<p>Profits from the Virginia Lottery help K-12 education in the state. In Alexandria, where Hirpo lives, the Virginia Lottery helped deliver more than $4.7 million for the last fiscal year for K-12 education. Overall, the Lottery helped raise more than $779 million for K-12 education for the fiscal year 2022, representing approximately 10% of the state’s K-12 school budget.</p>
