    <h1>Fitz Casino Casino In Southern California Motor City Casino Hotel Foxwoods Casino Concerts Casinos I</h1>

<p>This is the situation. I've been playing this since December 2020.</p>
<p>Everything was pretty good, there were also winnings, losses, but in April I was lucky to win .. My account went into a plus and then it started. In the month of May, as if the casino turned off the payoff in the slots for me, the slots were all empty, it was not realistic to win, the deposits flew away as if it should be, I outplayed many providers, changed a lot of games, they all played the same way. made a deposit so it immediately goes to 0, no matter in which game it does not matter which provider. I made deposits in the amount of 2842 euros in May, made deposits from 20 to 100 euros. In May, there were also more than one withdrawal of funds from this casino, since there was nothing to bet. (this is very strange for me, since I play more than 5 different casino sites, and there were also losses and there were winnings, all of them had withdrawals, except for Sol casino) I asked the casino to provide me with a rtp on rates for May, so to me this was denied. I mean that the casino fraudulently set up my account only to lose, because I am in the black with them, misled me and I was constantly losing money. I often wrote in support of to find out why the slots do not play absolutely all games. They answered me: You have good dynamics, you are in the black for the whole time, just change the game or the provider, (which I did) They also wrote: play, we have a very high return in slots.</p>
<p>With each of my requests, they wrote to support, and all problems were attributed to game providers</p>
