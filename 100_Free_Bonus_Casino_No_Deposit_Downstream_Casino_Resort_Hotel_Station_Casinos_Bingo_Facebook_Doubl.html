<p>Resorts World Las Vegas Embraces Crypto with Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Exchange</p>

<p>When Resorts World Las Vegas flings open its doors mid-June, the $4.3 billion resort will be optimized for crypto.</p>

<p>Malaysian developer Genting announced Thursday it has partnered with Winklevoss-owned cryptocurrency exchange Gemini to ensure the new property will be one of the most “crypto-friendly” places to be in Las Vegas</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the two companies said they were pursuing the “creation and implementation of crypto-friendly services at best-in-class institutional rates across all areas of the integrated resort experience.”</p>
<p>And together, they will explore “future opportunities that will allow Gemini crypto wallet users to use the cryptocurrency facility for payments at the US-based casino and hotel entity.”</p>
<p>Next Generation</p>
<p>The deal is a first for a Las Vegas Strip property, and resort Genting and Gemini promise their crypto-based services will be finalized and announced “in the coming weeks.” But for now, they’re keeping things suitably vague, leaving media outlets such as this one to speculate wildly.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, Resorts World’s patrons won’t be using bitcoin or any altcoins to gamble with just yet, because that would be illegal under Nevada law.</p>
<p>Casinos are only allowed to accept US currency on the gaming floor, but several already take bitcoin for goods and services.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the ability for their customers to use cryptocurrency at Resorts World Las Vegas or convert dollars into crypto, being one of the first to support crypto is a great way to meet the needs of the next generation of customers and provide a 21st-century experience,” said Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss.</p>
<p>The Gemini deal may be a first for the Strip, but it’s not a first for Las Vegas. Derek Stevens embraced bitcoin in a big way back in 2014 at his downtown D Las Vegas and Golden Gate properties, even installing a bitcoin ATM.</p>
<p>At the D and Golden Gate, you can pay for dining, hotel reservations, and items at the gift shops and the front desk using bitcoin. These payments are facilitated by Atlanta-based bitcoin service provider Bitpay.</p>
<p>Gambling with the Future</p>
<p>For now, Resorts World’s “crypto-friendly” offerings will be in a similar vein. Gambling with cryptocurrency may be one for the future.</p>
<p>And it may not happen until the US establishes its own national crypto, the long-rumored digital dollar, or “Fedcoin”– a blockchain-based currency that would be centralized, stable, and fraud resistant.</p>
<p>It’s an eventuality that casino suppliers are beginning to invest in. Earlier this year, slot machine manufacturer International Game Technology (IGT) received a patent for a system that would enable gamblers to transfer crypto from their accounts into a “gaming establishment account.”</p>
