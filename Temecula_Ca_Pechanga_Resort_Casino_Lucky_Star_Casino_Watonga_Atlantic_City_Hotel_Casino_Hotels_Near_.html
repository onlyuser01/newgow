<p>A new iGaming developer has been born with OctoPlay launching its inaugural games portfolio, a first for the company. OctoPlay has been established with the help of numerous content developers and is currently led by former Evolution and Red Tiger executive Carl Ejlertsson. The company already has games that are available with a select number of early adopters who have responded positively to the product and content brought on by OctoPlay.</p>
<p>First Games by OctoPlay Rollout for the New Studio</p>
<p>Among the company’s prominent hires are Nick Vuchev, who serves as commercial director, Martina Borg Stevens who serves as legal and compliance director, and Nicola Vella who serves as finance director.</p>
<p>OctoPlay has developed its proprietary games server to debut Pearly Shores, Heavy Anchor and Hot Harvest, which is the first taste players and operators can get a taste of what the company’s signature style, development director, and overall capabilities will be like. The games are also available to try on OctoPlay’s official website. Commenting on this announcement, Ejlertsson said:</p>
<p>OctoPlay is laser-focused on producing ground-breaking content for regulated markets. Our simple philosophy is to be licensed in every possible jurisdiction on the planet. If a license is available, we will get it as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Ejlertsson felt strongly about the inaugural titles that the company has debuted and said that they demonstrated OctoPlay’s commitment to making sure that players are having a great time. It’s all about delivering great, sustainable, and fun products, the executive noted.</p>
<p>Ejlertsson revealed OctoPlay via a LinkedIn announcement last month. At the time, the executive promised a new approach to “first-class player engagement,” and urged interested parties to stay tuned for more groundbreaking updates.</p>
