<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Casino Guru and bringing the issue to our attention. I’m sorry to hear that your winnings were cancelled. It is very common for casinos to limit the winnings from bonuses and implement other restrictions. The casino can form their own T&amp;Cs and set their own rules for the game play. I looked at the casino Bonus T&amp;Cs and found the following:</p>
<p>"Unless approved by management, Players cannot redeem additional coupons or promotional offers if they have a balance or pending cash-out. Coupons or promotional offers cannot be united. If at any time this should occur, winnings may be voided.</p>
<p>The Casino will occasionally offer Promotional Coupons as "Free Chips". The maximum withdrawal amount for any free chip given is 2x the value of the free chip. For example if you are given a $100 free chip and request a withdrawal amount of $500, you will only be approved for $200.</p>
<p>Free Chips cannot be used in succession by the Player. If a player redeems a free chip, regardless if the offer was sent to the Player via the Casino or they redeemed it via Customer Support, they cannot redeem a second Free Chip and be eligible for a withdrawal on that Free Chip’s winnings. It is the sole responsibility of the Player to ensure they are following the Free Chip rules. Withdrawals will be denied at the approval stage with the Payments team if this rule is broken."</p>
<p>To sum this up, it means, you can’t activate a new bonus while you have a pending withdrawal. The casino rep in the picture you sent us mentioned you played with free chips. According to the Bonus T&amp;Cs, you can only redeem one free chip. And lastly, there is a maximum win restriction of 2x the value of the free chip. If you broke these rules, I’m afraid we will not be able to help you. What was the value of your free chip?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
