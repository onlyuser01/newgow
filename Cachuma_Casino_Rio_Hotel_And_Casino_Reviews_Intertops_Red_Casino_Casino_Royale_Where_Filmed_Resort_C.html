<p>Developer of educational online gaming platforms and sports media Better Collective came up with a new initiative in the safer gambling space to offer players to self-detect potential problem gambling.</p>
<p>Detect Problem Gambling Traits</p>
<p>Better Collective announced a new problem gambling detection tool, Gamalyze, will feature on its main sports betting media brands, launching it on bettingexpert.com during the Safer Gambling Week, a cross-industry initiative promoting safer gambling in Great Britain and Ireland from November 1 till November 7, 2021.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling is a very important part of our business philosophy. By implementing Gamalyze on our websites, we give visitors an opportunity to test their gambling habits and find out if their gambling behaviour presents as fun and entertaining, as it should be, or if it is potentially problematic.” Jesper Søgaard, CEO and Co-Founder, Better Collective</p>
<p>Gamalyze, created by Better Collective-owned Mindway AI, represents a virtual card game offered to online players that provides deep insights into their gambling behavior by analyzing their decision-making based on neuroscientific principles.</p>
<p>Better Collective acquired 90% of Mindway AI stock at the beginning of this year to expand its gaming industry product range that helps operators identify players at risk of developing problem gambling and, by offering players protection, enhance the safety of the gambling environment.</p>
<p>A founding member of Responsible Affiliate in Gambling (RAiG), an organization founded in 2009 and focusing on problem gambling in the industry, Better Collective is working hand in hand with the independent body to help raise industry standards in respect to problem gambling by fostering wider initiatives in the marketing affiliate space in the UK.</p>
<p>Gamalyze’s Debut</p>
<p>The tool that identifies key characteristics of gambling behavior usually associated with problem gambling made its debut on the bettingexpert.com website, while other Better Collective platforms are set to follow suit shortly after.</p>
<p>Bettingexpert.com is the world’s biggest social network of sports betting tipsters. We have millions of visitors every year and with Gamalyze launched, we increase our focus on responsible gambling so our community can feel even safer when they visit our site.” Neil Smith, Head, Bettingexpert.com</p>
<p>In August, Better Collective posted impressive second quarter performance driven by its operations in the US which were further supported with the acquisition of The Action Network, posting 162% and 90% growth in revenue and EBITDA before accounting for the cost of the acquisition, respectively.</p>
<p>In October, Better Collective came up with a sophisticated $12 million incentive plan aimed at certain personnel at its newly acquired business to convince them to stay with the wider group.</p>
