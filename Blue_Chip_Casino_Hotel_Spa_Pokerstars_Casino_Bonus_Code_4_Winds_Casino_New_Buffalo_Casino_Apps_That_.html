    <h1>Blue Chip Casino Hotel Spa Pokerstars Casino Bonus Code 4 Winds Casino New Buffalo Casino Apps That</h1>

<p>Update.</p>
<p>Taylor has reached out and said that going forward if my wagering was low like it was the past month, then going forward the withdrawal limits would be slashed / and payouts not expedited. He has sent me proof of my wagering which was 600k and one for 29k not sure which picture corresponds to a month or if it was by a weekly thing. My prior month or two months before I had wagered nearly 14 million and to my knowledge have lost a significant amount of money. Hence I played a lot more conservatively the following months to try to recoup some of the funds.</p>
<p>I have told Taylor to relay to management that I would be more conscientious about my wagering going forward. I have checked their BTC wallet that I've been receiving funds from, and it doesn't seem like I'm the only one not getting paid. There seems to be two things that could be happening, they truly are experiencing having processor issues, or they're not paying out. I'm not sure they only have one wallet, but checking the dates on the transaction, not too many people are getting paid at all.</p>
<p>Again this is SPECULATION and NOT A FACT. I have tried reaching out to their management team via EMAIL like Taylor told me to and to be patient "even if they don't respond in the first hour you email them" , but haven't received a response in 3 days. Taylor has asked me to confirm which email they should be expecting and I confirmed that. Taylor has said that it would be a long weekend because in Canada they have a federal holiday this weekend, so I'm assuming I won't hear anything until Tuesday.</p>
<p>At this point, what I'd like from the management at JacksPay is more clear and available communication, Taylor is trying to reroute me to you guys but when I attempt to do so, there is radio silence. I'd like to know a timeframe for my remaining withdrawals, so I can hopefully get back to normal and playing. As someone who has deposited and wagered a significant amount with your guys' casino and is being ghosted like this, I fear to imagine how the casual player would be treated.</p>
<p>Hope I can update this soon with a more cheerful update.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
