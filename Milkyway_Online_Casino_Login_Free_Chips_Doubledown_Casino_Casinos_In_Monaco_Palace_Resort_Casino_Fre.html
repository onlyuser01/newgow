    <h1>Milkyway Online Casino Login Free Chips Doubledown Casino Casinos In Monaco Palace Resort Casino Fre</h1>

<p>Hello, I am writing to you from Ukraine, I have a terrible situation with this casino. 4 days ago I registered, played the bonus in accordance with all the rules and passed full verification, and for four days I tried to withdraw money, they wrote to me that I entered the crypto address incorrectly, but I have been using Binance for 4 years and I know what a crypto address is, and yesterday I couldnâ€™t log into my account at all, they ignored me all day or wrote again that I needed the correct address, although I could no longer log into my account. And just now they wrote that I violated the rules of the bonus without even explaining anything.Oh before this, when I made a first withdrawal request yesterday, then a day later, I wrote to support, and the funds were returned to my account, then I created another request, they returned again, and now for the third time I ask you to withdraw funds I have fulfilled all the conditions. I put my BTC cryptoadress in wallet ID Please help me , I will atached some screenshots, my name is Oleksandra <strong><em>*. My email is </em></strong>*@inbox.lv</p>
<p>That<code>s what I</code>m writing to them</p>
<p>Inquiry: I am writing to you probably for the tenth time, and there is no result. I have been unable to use the account on which I have completed full verification for three days, and today I lost the ability to log in altogether. Your colleagues and I have submitted multiple tickets, but the department responsible for this issue is working terribly. Can you imagine that I cannot log into my account, but it tells me that I am probably entering the wrong Wallet ID? Do you understand what is going on there? I cannot access my account, and it is giving me an error about a crypto address. I am having a panic attack. Please understand that there is a war going on in our country, the Internet is very bad, and the connection is weak. I am tired of constantly running out of shelter to ask for a phone and catch a signal. Please be human, release my money. I do not want to write reviews about you on websites and advertise you on Instagram. I attached some screenshots. Please help.</p>
