    <h1>Valley Forge Casino Casino Cards Everygame Casino Classic Horseshoe Casino Baltimore Huuuge Casino S</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal of £649 on 25 June 2021. I had made over £1000 deposits on 25 June 2021 from my debit card via my daughter's PayPal account. I was unaware that I should not have used that method, I thought it would be okay as I was using my own account to deposit on Casino Joy.</p>
<p>I won back £649 and requested the withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have sent dozens and dozens of emails to their document dept, support dept and complaints dept. All they keep doing is send out the same standard letter and keep requesting the same verification documents from me. I have sent them every document they have requested more than once. I have emailed them and uploaded them onto their site. My daughter has sent a signed declaration confirming she allowed me to use her Paypal and I have sent the details of my deposits showing they are from my card. I am extremely angry and frustrated with this whole affair and in my last email two days again I asked them to either pay out my winnings or alternatively, refund all the deposit monies made to Casino Joy on 25 June back to the PayPal account. They can then close the account as I would not want to play on their site again. As usual they have not responded and I am now considering all options to act against this disgraceful company. I have never experienced such a lack of any customer service with an online slots company. Other companies have always been very good and have good reputations but this one is just awful and I would warn people to beware Genesis Global and play with other more reputable casino companies.</p>
