    <h1>San Diego Casinos Casino Hotels Biloxi Pultz Casino Casino Royale Film Cast 24 Hour Casino Near Me S</h1>

<p>This is re: my complaint and review etc.</p>
<p>Also, I didn't include the majority of info. Some for confidentiality reasons. The conversations with chat, emails, etc. They knew right off the bat I don't have a utility bill etc. and would be using ID and banking. I also included several other non-accepted forms such as RRSP, government support money, etc. (all with name, address, official documents) just to show that it's obviously me unless I'm sitting at home scamming countless official, legal documents which is impossible. Even though I knew they weren't accepted it definitely shows I'm the good guy here.</p>
<p>So keep in mind, they know I don't have utility bills or government employment papers. I'm a student and live at home so the utility isn't under my name.</p>
<p>Here are the documents that were denied most recently. The ones I got from the CIBC. It's a physical bank not a virtual bank. Anyone that doesn't accept their proof is a scammer no doubt.</p>
<p>The denial was for my Simplii since its a virtual bank although tons of people use it as their primary bank as I was. It's a huge bank. The other ones are the CIBC statements. They are a physical bank. One of the biggest out there. Those were denied too.</p>
<p>Let me know the next step to take. If they want something specific like a PDF form. I've gone above and beyond definitively proving my identity and they knew my situation. I even opened a new bank account (2 actually a debit and credit).</p>
