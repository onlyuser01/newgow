<p>Rise of Titans Slot Review</p>
<p>Titans are the mythical creatures that preceded the Gods of Greek Mythology, and they are back! The cosmic clash between these two powerful groups of entities now spills over the grid in the Rise of Titans slot game which we will take a closer look at right now. The game tells the story of the rivalry between the Titans and the Olympic gods who sit on both sides of the five-by-four grid, offering you a chance to bet anything from $0.25 to $100.</p>
<p>Players will play across 25 paylines and gain access to a variety of game features implemented by DragonGaming to truly elevate and set apart the experience. All four characters at the bottom of the reel will be charging with power as you spin the reels and depending on which one prevails, you will get certain additional perks. We will talk about this in a moment.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: The Ultimate Clash Between the Gods</p>
<p>The setting is Olympus where titans and gods will clash over who has a right to exist, and who has to be banished and exiled. This highly thematic setting is accentuated by the animated figures of Cronus, the titan and father of Zeus, and the God of Thunder himself who are locked in an eternal fight over the reels of Rise of Titans.</p>
<p>To add to the beauty of the game, the backdrop is transparent, and you can see Mount Olympus and the Gods’ city that is now besieged by Cronus, designed as a hellspawn and a demon. The game allows you to constantly contribute towards one of the four character-based bonus features with each win loading a different gameplay feature that gets revealed later on.</p>
<p>The bonus gameplay features tend to be a little elusive, as the volatility here means that you will win less frequently, but still enjoy more sizeable wins when you do. There is a Gamble Feature, and all the symbols are nicely designed to add that immersiveness to the gameplay. Culminating into a bonus game is definitely what you should be looking forward to here, though, but it may take you a while before you trigger this feature in the first place.</p>
<p>Still, once you do, the wait will have been worth it. We will touch on how the symbols and special bonus games in the title work.</p>
<p>Rise of Titans Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Rise of Titans plays with 25 paylines and it’s really rich when it comes to what you can do with those lines. The RTP is higher than expected at 96.50% and the game makes sure that you are getting decent value out of the gameplay.</p>
<p>In terms of symbols and their value, you can expect the Q, J, K, and A, as the low-paying ones, for which you get 40-70 payouts for five symbols, depending on the symbol. The high-paying ones are depicted as Gods and the Titan Cronus, or perhaps Hades, depending on how you want to see the demonic figure that sits across the reels from Zeus.</p>
<p>Hades/Cronus pays 150 for 5 symbols, and Zeus pays 250 for 5 symbols. Interestingly, the Wild Symbol pays 250 for 5 symbols, so just a bit more than the other high-paying symbols. You still want to align as many Wilds as you can.</p>
<p>Speaking of symbols there are also the dedicated Free Spins which can award up to 21 free spins if you end up aligning five of these symbols. Oh, and if you do happen to open the Pandora Box on the fifth reel, you may release quite a few goodies!</p>
<p>The box comes with a possible 300x max multiplier based on your bet, Free Spins, Power Boosts (for the special four characters that can trigger additional gains), or Wrath Mode Free Spins. There is a lot!</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>In terms of how authentic the gameplay is, you can expect Rise of Titans to be truly spot-on. The game is designed to bring you into the thick of this epic battle that will see Titans and gods clash – albeit a little metaphorically, as there is no actual fight between them. Still, Ancient Greece is written all over to bring you a highly distinguishable experience, crisp graphics, and a really good ambiance.</p>
<p>Rise of Titans Gameplay</p>
<p>Rise of Titans plays quite easily as a matter of fact. The game allows you to make swift adjustments to its gameplay and benefits from several great features designed to add comfort to your core gameplay. The game allows you to quickly change the betting levels and value of the coins, as well as Max Bet when you want to.</p>
<p>You can also go to the Settings page and pick a Turbo Option or further tinker with the audio and graphics to optimize the experience for your particular device. All of this is quite intuitive and will feel very natural when you check it out for the first time.</p>
<p>Rise of Titans Features: Wrath, Free Spins, Meters, and Pandora’s Box</p>
<p>Wrath Mode Free Spins: Apart from a Free Spins Mode, the game also features the Wrath ode Free Spins which is a slightly more rewarding version of the game altogether. All High Pay Symbols have the Power Meter full and will always be turned into Sticky Wilds with some added value!</p>
<p>Power Meter: The Power Meter can be a lot of fun especially if you play with high stakes, as once you collect one of the four Power Meters, you trigger a Wrath Free Spins mode, and you will get all matching symbols be worth the value of your average bet during the normal game during which you collected it. This could result in some very juicy payouts later on!</p>
<p>Free Spins: Free Spins can be claimed with the special symbol that activates them. If you get five of these, you will trigger 21 freebies which will once again turn high-paying symbols into Sticky Symbols.</p>
<p>Pandora’s Box: The Pandora Box is full of surprises. Seldom as it happens to hit the reels, you can expect to find decent rewards inside. You may get up to 300x multiplier on your bet, for a possible $3,000 payout, or enjoy Free Spins, Wrath Free Spins, and other perks.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Rise of Titans and Conquering Divinity</p>
<p>Rise of Titans seeps with Ancient Mythology, but it doesn’t rely on this great narrative to do all the heavy lifting. DragonGaming has built a product that is solid on every level and that brings you joy through clever mechanics, crisp graphics, and a feeling of working towards a purpose. The bonus features are built to fit the setting, but also to elevate your experience with every spin of the reels. Try the Rise of Titans slot by DragonGaming for free or real money today.</p>
