    <h1>New Casino Casino Council Bluffs Iowa Party Casino Nj Sam S Town Hotel Casino Shreveport Lake Charle</h1>

<p>Endorphina’s senior sales manager, Jonathan Martini, called the move a “collaboration between two of the industry’s leading online casino providers”</p>
<p>Endorphina has become the latest studio to see its content added to Relax Gaming’s Powered By Relax aggregation platform. Thanks to a newly-minted partnership agreement, Relax Gaming will help the provider’s games reach more operators and players than ever before.</p>
<p>As a result, Relax Gaming’s partnering operators will be able to get access to Endorphina’s engaging content, which includes hit games such as Joker Ra, Vampires 2 and Minotauros, among many others.</p>
<p>The Prague-based studio was founded eleven years ago and has grown to be one of the go-to suppliers of online casino content. Its games sport visually striking graphics and engaging gameplay that is backed by reliable math models. Endorphina’s portfolio currently numbers more than 100 games, which will now be integrated into Powered By’s lineup of 4,000+ titles.</p>
<p>The new partnership will greatly expand Endorphina’s footprint, allowing it to reach many new players who would enjoy what it has to offer. Relax Gaming’s robust distribution network of partners and its unrivaled speed to market will ensure provide Endorphina with the edge it needs to grow its presence.</p>
<p>Endorphina recently struck a similar deal with REEVO. Several months earlier, the supplier announced the rollout of its products with Cbet.</p>
<p>The Deal Is a Significant Milestone for Endorphina</p>
<p>Endorphina’s senior sales manager, Jonathan Martini, called the move a “collaboration between two of the industry’s leading online casino providers” and a “significant milestone” for his company. The tie-up, according to Martini, sets the stage for a new era of entertainment.</p>
<p>By uniting Endorphina’s visually pleasing games and the large number of regulated markets that they work in with Relax Gaming’s technical excellence, both companies will expand their global reach and boost their product offerings. Jonathan Martini, senior sales manager, Endorphina</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s recently-appointed chief product officer, Shelley Hannah, also shared her thoughts on the matter. She noted that her team is constantly seeking out new products to add to the Powered By Relax program. Because of that, Hannah and her team were happy to welcome Endorphina to the Relax Gaming family.</p>
<p>We are delighted to add Endorphina to our roster of third-party studios, adding a rich portfolio of engaging content and product creativity to our customers. We look forward to a successful future partnership. Shelley Hannah, CPO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>In the meantime, Relax Gaming continues to grow its proprietary portfolio of gaming content. A few days ago, the supplier launched a new samurai-themed slot called Torii Tumble.</p>
