<p>The Texas Longhorns vs. Washington Huskies game is the semifinal of the 2023-24 College Football Playoffs. Whoever wins the 2024 Sugar Bowl at Caesars Superdome will get to fight for the national title.</p>
<p>Judging by the Sugar Bowl odds, bookies think the Longhorns are more likely to win. That’s no surprise as they’ve been brilliant throughout this season, winning the Big 12 Championship in their most recent outing.</p>
<p>The Huskies, however, have no intention of giving up without a fight. They too have been brilliant so far, winning the Pac-12 Championship the last time they went on the football field.</p>

<p>Texas Longhorns Want Revenge</p>
<p>The Texas Longhorns went 12-1 in 2023, winning the Big 12 Championship in their most recent game. The game saw them destroy the Oklahoma State Cowboys 49-21.</p>
<p>This season, we also saw them beat a couple of big teams, most notably, the Alabama Crimson Tide. Their only loss of the 2023 campaign happened against the Oklahoma Sooners who scored the winning touchdown in the final minute of the game.</p>
<p>It was their first loss since December 29, 2022, when they lost 27-20 to the Washington Huskies. The game in question was the Alamo Bowl, which saw Washington’s quarterback Michael Penix Jr. win the MVP award. Will we see him do the same in the 2024 Sugar Bowl?</p>
<p>All Eyes on Michael Penix Jr. and Washington’s Offense</p>
<p>Many analysts believe that Michael Penix Jr. is Washington’s biggest asset and the key man for the game with Texas. This guy has been brilliant for the Huskies, helping them get to a 37.7 PPG in 2023.</p>
<p>He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the NCAAF, so the Huskies fans have every right to hope for a good offensive display of their team in the 2024 Sugar Bowl. But what about the performance of their defensive team?</p>
<p>Washington’s defense is 46th in the nation, allowing 23.6 points per game. In fact, their defense is to blame for making a couple of their recent games more tense than they were supposed to be. The thing is that the Huskies conceded 20+ points in each of their last six games, winning their last three by no more than a field goal.</p>
<p>Texas Longhorns vs. Washington Huskies Sugar Bowl Prediction</p>
<p>The Texas Longhorns’ offense has the potential to wreak havoc on the Washington Huskies, possibly scoring more than their average of 36.2 points per game. Unfortunately for their fans, their defensive players just do not look capable of stopping Penix Jr. &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The result is that, even though we’re likely to see a lot of points on both ends, the Washington Huskies will be the ones to win the 2024 Sugar Bowl in the end.</p>
<p>Pick: Washington Huskies &amp; Over 63.0 Points</p>
