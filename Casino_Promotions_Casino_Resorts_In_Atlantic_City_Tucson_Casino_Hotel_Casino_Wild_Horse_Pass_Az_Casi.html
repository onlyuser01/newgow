    <h1>Casino Promotions Casino Resorts In Atlantic City Tucson Casino Hotel Casino Wild Horse Pass Az Casi</h1>

<p>Dear helennah,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your negative experience with PokerStars Casino. I checked the website and found these rules apply regarding money transfers in the casino:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real money transfers</li>
</ol>
<p>12.1</p>
<p>Real money transfers may be made between Users in the Gaming Platform for the sole purpose of playing Real Money Games. To make a transfer of real money to another User via the Gaming Platform, you will need to enter the amount to transfer and the Username of the intended recipient. You must only make transfers on the basis of your own freely made choice, and you must ensure you know who the other User(s) is/are before making any transfer.</p>
<p>12.2</p>
<p>You may not withdraw funds directly received from a transfer. All transferred funds must be used to play Real Money Games, and you may request a withdrawal of any resulting winnings. We will process that request unless we have a right to delay the withdrawal, void any related transactions, or recover or not pay out any balance, winnings, funds, rewards or other credits under the General Terms. To help protect Users, guard against money laundering and fraud, and ensure the integrity of the service, winnings arising from Real Money Games played with transferred funds will be reviewed before they may be withdrawn. Users may be asked to comply with certain Verification Requests or provide other reasonable information in order for a transfer to be processed and/or before you will be allowed to withdraw any such winnings.</p>
<p>12.3</p>
<p>Where appropriate we will restrict your Account by setting limits on the amounts or availability of transfers (either generally or for a specific User) and/or decline or reverse any transfers, if we become aware or reasonably suspect the sending or receiving User has been involved in any Prohibited Event (and we will otherwise deal with your Account as set out in Part B Section 17).</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in contact with casino support?</p>
<p>Have you used your device to register in the casino and play?</p>
<p>Does the disputed amount ($25) represent the transfer you attempted to make?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
