    <h1>Altantic City Casinos Pahrump Casinos Avalon Casino Boston Casinos Riverwalk Casino PlayAlberta Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, I’d like help in this matter.</p>
<p>I join Play Alberta a few months ago.</p>
<p>had many loss but always understood the risk.</p>
<p>the other day I won on the slots 650 total. I did a withdrawal of the amount but later at night it was not processed and decided to cancel it and play some more ( I own the mistake and decision) I decided to play some high bet slots to see if I can multiple my win.</p>
<p>i went up and down several times and got lose in the time till I somehow realized my balance was on the 150 approx. i stopped right away and did a withdrawal (successfully this time) at that moment is when I realized and remembered a few weeks ago I had set up deposit and loss limits . My loss limit was set at 30</p>
<p>so how was it possible to lose this amount of money? I went to chat live where they told my loss was only at 29. I said how? I had 650 a few hours ago and no 150. Do the math. He then proceed to tell me I know what you mean and opened a case for me. So far no replies. I feel very unsettled about this matter. I know gambling comes with losses but I know I can carry away with it which is exactly why as a responsible gambler decided to set limits.</p>
<p>i believe the casino should take responsibility on this matter .</p>
<p>weird thing after i closed the chat and I clicked on my accounts to finish a bet on a slot machine the limit message appeared… conveniently in that moment. A bit too late perhaps?</p>
