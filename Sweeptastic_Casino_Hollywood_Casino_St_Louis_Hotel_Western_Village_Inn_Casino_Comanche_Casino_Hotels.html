    <h1>Sweeptastic Casino Hollywood Casino St Louis Hotel Western Village Inn Casino Comanche Casino Hotels</h1>

<p>After multiple attempts to communicate with auriel who’s acting for bitstarz to get my withdrawals paid I have now had to come here as they are continuing to bully and withhold money owed to me</p>
<p>first off.</p>
<p>I have been verified here multiple times</p>
<p>I deposit here daily "tens of thousands so far"</p>
<p>never withdrew but made sure I was verified first</p>
<p>I have sent all 3 bank cards they have said I’ve used over time to deposit with</p>
<p>they have been verified, everything else verified and fine</p>
<p>now here is the twist and were they are trying to bully me is there is a card I used months and months ago with, this card I also used online to deposit at other online casinos.</p>
<p>that card at one point had a few attempted unauthorised transactions made, my bank shut that account down, I since left that bank months ago for my current bank were all 3 cards I own from my current bank have been supplied to bitstarz and all approved yet they won’t pay me because this card from a old bank I was with and left months and months ago they want to see yet no withdrawal attempt has been made against that at all, I managed to supply them with a transaction proof and document showing that card was mine, did exist, and showed them proof from a bank statement with deposits made to them with there name</p>
<p>and they still won’t pay me.</p>
<p>I also told them respectfully and sadly that my daughter was born with a terminal illness back in June, sadly my grandmother passed away on my birthday last year and my mother sadly is going down hill with her cancer treatment the same as my grandmother suffered. And they continue to bully, be nasty and illegally and unlawfully withhold my money legitimately and honestly won.</p>
<p>So close to Xmas I’m sadden these people think they can do this, this money was to go towards my daughter born with cystic fibrosis and her enzymes and medical cost as she’s only 5 and a half months old</p>
<p>shame on this casino and I want everyone to know this</p>
