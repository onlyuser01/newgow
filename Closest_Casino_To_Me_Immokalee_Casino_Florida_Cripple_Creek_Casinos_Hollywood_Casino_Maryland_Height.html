    <h1>Closest Casino To Me Immokalee Casino Florida Cripple Creek Casinos Hollywood Casino Maryland Height</h1>

<p>God, I am over this, I just wanted to let people know that they are thieves. Lets Recap because the whole story seems to have gotten lost. My friends and I deposited Some money into My Hellspin account, under my Name. We played for a few Days on and off and built up a small amount of $400. When we tried to withdraw this money, it just never happened, there was always another problem. The Document was fuzzy, the document had 2 ids with it, the document was a screen shot not a photo, the document was not accepted, blah blah blah. I sat at my computer for 10 hours, uploading documents, trying to withdraw as I was not going to be beaten. However I was, after 10 hours of trying, I just went and gmabled all the money away to nothing. It seemed that the easiest way to withdraw was to crypto. However If you deposit with a credit card you have to cash out with a credit card. So, Stupidly, on another day I deposited XRP as that was the easiest way to withdraw by their say so. I went to deposit $20, but was declined as they have a limit of $70 deposit for XRP. So I deposited $70 by XRP, Admittedly I did not see their ammount, and I calculated $70 into XRP through Coinspot, who is my crypto broker. which gave me the figure I deposited 146.087777. They claim they did not recieve it. Their website gave me the address to deposit to.</p>
<p>(from the Hellspin Website)</p>
<p>I deposited the ammount at the time from Coinspot.</p>
<p>(from coinspot, my account showing their deposit address)</p>
<p>I was directed by coinspot to check the ammount went to Hellspin, by checking the online XRP Ledger.</p>
<p>(XRP online ledger saying the transaction was recieved)</p>
<p>I also spoke to Coinspot who told me the transaction went to the said address. Now If they did not recieve the money, and the money was deposited, left my account, went to their address, and they didnt get it, but the transaction cleared on the ledger, then someones lying, Thats not me, thats not Coinspot, It's HELLSPIN LYING CASINO.</p>
<p>So all up, these lying AHOLE CLOWNS have cost me $470. I have provided ample proof to this effect. To You, and To them, but they just dont listen, No No No from them. I am just tring to warn others of their thieving ways. It seems that it is impossible to report them as it is to get them to payout.</p>
<p>I hope this clears everything up.</p>
