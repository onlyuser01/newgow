    <h1>Casino Lisboa Casino In Queens Ny Golden Casino Caf Hollywood At Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Menu</h1>

<p>Thank you for the confirmation, justinmoffatt7. I'm glad that you received your winnings.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that this is your case, maybe there was just some small error, but the casino has this mentioned in its T&amp;Cs</p>
<p>The Player hereby agreed that Highway Casino retains exclusive control over any services provided, including but not limited to starting/ending promo activities, adding/removing games, and changing limitations, all without prior notification.</p>
<p>Another thing is that if there are no financial obligations of the casino towards players and the player's casino account balance is zero, the casino can close such accounts and discontinue providing their services at their discretion. This is quite common in the industry.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe the main thing is that you have successfully received your winnings in full now.</p>
<p>As the complainant confirmed that the funds were successfully received, we consider this complaint to have been successfully resolved. We will now close it as "resolved" in our system. I would like to thank both parties for their cooperation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you encounter any problems with this or any other casino in the future. We are here to help you.</p>
<p>As you know, we do not charge for our services, nor do we accept any gratuities. However, we would appreciate it if you could take a moment to share your experience with our services on Trustpilot https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/casino.guru. An honest review and any suggestions you may have to improve our complaint resolution and mediation process would be greatly appreciated. Your feedback could prove helpful to others who are considering contacting us about any online casino-related issues.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
