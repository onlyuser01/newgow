    <h1>Black Oaks Casino North Lake Tahoe Casinos Fanduel Casino Grand Falls Casino Iowa Best Casino In Lak</h1>

<p>I had no problem depositing to rollingslots. instantly. I was fortunate enough to have a win, selected deposit to bank account. First they said I hadn’t verified my account - this took 2 weeks &amp; excessive documentation (bank records etc). Received confirmation account verified. But, when I asked if my withdrawal would now be pain they said no. That deposit to bank account not available due to technical error. I’d need to choose crypto (which I don’t use) AND make "make the minimum deposit without wagering x 3 to be able to make a withdrawal. Um what? This request directly opposes rollingslots.com money laundering policy of deposits without wagering may be identified as suspicious and player account cancelled. I have asked several times to be provided with details of complaints dept. no response.</p>
<p>Ive questioned the minimum deposit advice vs their money laundering police - no response. I’ve asked has the bank deposit technical issue been resolved - no response. They just keep sending the same "choose another method, minimum deposit without wagering x3" email. It’s pathetic, why would anyone deposit MORE funds when they won’t process the withdrawal you requested weeks ago??? I’m at my wits end &amp; wish I’d never played on this site!</p>
