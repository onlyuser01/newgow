<p>These wins come after several lucky players hit jackpots at Caesars Palace Las Vegas in February this year</p>
<p>Caesars Palace, a Las Vegas casino owned by Caesars Entertainment, paid out two big wins last Friday. One of the winners struck a big prize when playing a slot, while the other cashed in on video poker.</p>
<p>The first win saw one Caesars Palace Las Vegas Visitor win $489,649 from playing a slot called Red, White and Blue. The game is developed by International Game Technology, a world leader in gambling tech and solutions.</p>
<p>While Caesars refrained from releasing more details about the player and the winner themselves preferred to remain anonymous, we know that the life-changing moment happened on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Several hours later another player’s life was changed by Caesars Palace. The second player won $240,000 from video poker, although he also preferred to remain anonymous for the time being.</p>
<p>Other Recent Caesars Palace Winners</p>
<p>Many Caesars Palace players have been getting lucky since the beginning of the year as these are far from the only jackpot winners for the year.</p>
<p>In early February, Bonnie Rivers, a running back for the Los Angeles Rams, won a whopping $514,837 from Three Card Poker.</p>
<p>Around a month ago, an anonymous player also became a jackpot winner, taking home $401,000 thanks to his video poker performance.</p>
<p>A day later, two players won video poker jackpots at the venue. The first of the two won $440,000, while the second one earned $120,300.</p>
<p>Caesars Continues to Lead Gambling in NA</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment is one of the biggest gambling companies in North America. The famous operator has an extensive reach and it’s the company of choice of many players in the US and beyond.</p>
<p>The online gambling content aggregator Pariplay just unveiled an agreement with Caesars Entertainment’s Ontarian arm, Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino. Under the agreement, the former company will power the gambling juggernaut with games. As a result, titles from Wizard Games, a studio owned by Pariplay, launched on Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Caesars experienced certain setbacks in 2022, because of which its losses ramped up and its rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings declined. Luckily, the operator’s business rebounded and the ratings firm eventually improved its rating.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the casino giant provided industry enthusiasts with a sneak peek into its upcoming casino in Nebraska. The property is called Harrah’s Columbus, NE Racing &amp; Casino and marks Caesars’ foray into the Cornhusker State.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, Caesars also announced that it is stepping up the fight against problem gambling.</p>
