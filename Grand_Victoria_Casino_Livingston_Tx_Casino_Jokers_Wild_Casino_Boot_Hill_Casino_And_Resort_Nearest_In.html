<p>Maxima Compliance Hires Filippo Ferri as Its First CCO</p>
<p>Maxima Compliance’s strategic appointment of Filippo Ferri as its CCO aims to strengthen its commercial operations. Ferri will be based out of the company’s office in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Maxima Compliance CEO Antonio Zanghi stated that Filippo would bring years of gaming experience to the team. Ferri’s experience of more than 15 years in the field includes roles at GLI, Evolution Gaming, and Inspired Gaming. For more than 3 of those years he spent as a director of the iGaming strategy and new products at BMM Tetslabs.</p>
<p>Ferri’s hiring is part of Maxima’s quick expansion. The move follows the hire of Paola Menachem as director of regulatory and licensing last December. She has rich experience as a gaming counsel in leading industry providers, such as Omilia, the Zeal Group, Smithfield Partners, and Intralot. As a leader of the regulatory and licensing, she will turn to enter new markets and maintaining existing ones into a smooth process.</p>
<p>Zanghi said that as their first CCO, Ferri’s is going to oversee commercial operations while the company makes strategic moves to expand further on a global scale. He said that his expertise is going to be a great addition to Maxima.</p>
<p>Maxima Compliance’s Growth Story Continues</p>
<p>This year Maxima partnered up with PlayStarCasino and sports betting operator Gaming1. The company also showed its new Maxima Quality Assurance service.</p>
<p>To optimize game roll-out, Maxima Compliance introduced its Maxima Quality Assurance service last month. The service ensures that the product would reach any market without any issues. Developers could streamline their product development to make sure it’s ready for certification. The QA ensures no software issues and targets jurisdiction compliance. The QA service is available for suppliers worldwide.</p>
<p>Ferri commented on his hire, stating that Maxima grew rapidly over the past few years. The company offers a unique world-class service, he said and concluded that he is thrilled to join the company and be a part of a remarkable growth story as it continues to unfold.</p>
