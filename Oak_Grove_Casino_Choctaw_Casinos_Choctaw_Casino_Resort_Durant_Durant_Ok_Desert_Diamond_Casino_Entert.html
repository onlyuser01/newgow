<p>The New Game Delivers Immersive Entertainment</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, said that the fresh release delivers immersive and engaging experiences for online players. She pointed out that Fire Archer also offers potential for big prizes as well as engaging mechanics such as free spins.</p>
<p>“Our talented team of designers, artists and composers have created a slot where the excitement of play is encapsulated perfectly through the symbols on screen, the captivating sound of arrows firing and our main protagonist being animated to draw and fire his bow,” said Cornides. Finally, she predicted that the new slot will be well-received and provide memorable experiences for the players.</p>
<p>“Fire Archer provides an immersive world for players where upgrading features culminate in big win potential and a crescendo of excitement and wild wins in the free spins round.“ Irina Cornides, chief operating officer at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>The release of Fire Archer comes after Pragmatic recently released other hits like Mammoth Gold Megaways, Fish Eye and Monster Superlanche, among other games. Additionally, the new slot further expands Pragmatic’s continuously growing portfolio of games which now offers more than 300 unique titles.</p>
<p>Super Wilds and Scatters</p>
<p>The sharpshooting archer who is the main character of the new game never misses hitting wild symbols which are depicted as targets. Once such a symbol appears, the archer shoots it with an arrow, then the wilds “substitute all other symbols except the free spin-awarding scatter symbols and aid players in unlocking wins,” explains the game developer.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fire Archer players can also benefit from free spins. Hitting three scatters grants the slot players five free spins. During that round, super wild symbols can also be upgraded. What’s more, during the bonus round, players can also trigger additional bonuses granting them extra spins.</p>
