<p>Leading global digital performance publisher XLMedia announced on Wednesday that it is going to seek a new non-executive chair of the company.</p>
<p>Christopher Bell to Step Down from His Position as Non-executive Chair</p>
<p>The announcement comes after Christopher Bell, who served as non-executive chair, informed XLMedia that he intends to step down from his position at the company. Besides stepping down as non-executive chair, Bell is also stepping down from his position as a part of the company’s Board.</p>
<p>During his tenure at XLMedia, Bell has held key roles helping through the company’s IPO in 2014. Moreover, he supported XLMedia during multiple successful strategic acquisitions. Bell has also played a pivotal role in the most recent restructuring of the business itself. Overall, he was a part of XLMedia for nearly eight years.</p>
<p>The announcement of Bell stepping down from his executive position coincides with his recent appointment as non-executive chairman at the international gaming operator Nueva Codere. With that in mind, before stepping into this position, he would need to receive the approval of Codere’s shareholders. The approval is expected at a general meeting set for February 2, 2021. According to XLMedia, Bell is going to “assist in the orderly transfer to a new Chair and leave his role as Chair in due course.”</p>
<p>Being a Part of XLMedia for Nearly 8 Years Was a Privilege, Says Bell</p>
<p>In a statement, Bell outlined that being a part of XLMedia for nearly eight years was a privilege. He acknowledged that this year marks an important milestone for the company’s structure as it is “set to benefit from significant progress made in rebalancing the Group to have a greater focus on regulated high-growth markets like US Sports.”</p>

<p>“We are very grateful to Chris for his exceptional service to XLMedia.” Stuart Simms, CEO at XLMedia</p>
<p>XLMedia’s CEO, Stuart Simms, outlined that the company is grateful for Bell’s exceptional service.
