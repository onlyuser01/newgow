<p>The new DraftKings Cashpicks fantasy sports application confirms that the company may consider further expansion into the vertical</p>
<p>DraftKings is currently at the helm of the sports betting sector across the United States. As a leading sports betting brand, it also offers online daily fantasy sports (DFS) in nearly two dozen states. While DraftKings has a strong presence in this vertical, it is likely to continue its expansion, considering it filed a trademark application for a new fantasy sports game.</p>
<p>Details regarding the new trademark application were released by Mike Dzikowski via X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. He was able to uncover DraftKings’ application with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The new fantasy sports game, called DraftKings Cashpicks, looks like a competitor to fantasy sports companies such as Underdog Sports, as well as Prize Picks.</p>
<p>Filed on May 11, 2023, the trademark application describes DraftKings Cashpicks as an application for fantasy sports competitions. DraftKings Cashpicks would provide entertainment services related to fantasy sports competitions and it would be distributed via website or mobile app. While there are only a handful of details about the new fantasy sports app, the filing clearly shows that DraftKings may consider expanding in the DFS vertical in the near future.</p>
<p>“Downloadable mobile applications for use in fantasy sports competitions, namely, mobile applications for managing and participating in fantasy sports competitions. Entertainment services in the nature of fantasy sports competitions, provided via downloadable mobile software applications, via a website, and distributed via various platforms across multiple forms of transmission media. Entertainment services in the nature of sports betting,“ reads DraftKings’ filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office</p>
<p>The details regarding DraftKings’ application filing come after last month, Underdog Fantasy’s co-CEO and founder, Jeremy Levine, spoke about the DFS vertical, criticizing FanDuel and DraftKings’ dominance. He explained that Underdog is against strong competition in the face of the aforementioned companies, pointing out that their duopoly model enabled them to capture some 80% of the sports betting market in the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, Levine claimed that DraftKings and FanDuel wanted to stop companies from venturing into the DFS sector. “DraftKings and FanDuel want to prevent you from playing the fantasy sports you love. They want to quash competition in fantasy and stop innovation, and potential rivals, in sports betting,” he wrote at the time.</p>
<p>Still, despite the trademark application, DraftKings is yet to officially release details regarding its intentions and the future of DraftKings Cashpicks.</p>
