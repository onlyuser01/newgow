    <h1>Oyo Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino In Charles Town Wv Snoqualmie Casino Royalton Punta Cana Resor</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>I was browsing the websites on Thursday 6/2/2022 looking for an online cadino because I was firmly convinced that I had to play today and then I would win. You have to know that I have been playing off and on for about 17 years and have always locked myself out of the casinos permanently because I have always lost money. Where it wasn't possible to do it myself online, I always wrote an email to support asking them to exclude themselves. There are so many casino platforms and that's not good for me, because then I'll start looking for another casino. Now on to 6/2/22. I created an account and played without suspecting anything and unfortunately lost 2000 euros. Then I started a request via chat if it is possible to get a bonus. Support initially offered me 20 euros but then withdrew and wrote that they now saw that I requested self-exclusion due to a gaming issue 4 months ago. Then I was irritated? Then everything came back to me... If I excluded myself, then it shouldn't be possible to open an account again and receive my money with my same email address, date of birth and same place of residence. The support asked me to send an email to support@slotimo.com, which I did. Haven't gotten any response from the casino yet. At least they could write that they received the message and are taking care of my request.</p>
<p>I'm attaching the email here, along with the screen of the chat process, which I quickly made during the chat.</p>
<p>I saw that there was a similar dispute at this casino before and they helped the player get the 2200 euros refunded.</p>
<p>Please help me to get my 2000 euros back.</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards</p>
<p>Bridget</p>
