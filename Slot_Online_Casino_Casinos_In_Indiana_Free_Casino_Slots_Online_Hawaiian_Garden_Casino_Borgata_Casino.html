<p>The iGaming industry content provider and developer of innovative games, 7777 gaming, announced a new deal that will expand further the reach of its leading content. The company confirmed Monday it entered into a partnership with the leading online and mobile casino games provider and aggregator, IGT PlayDigital.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, content from 7777 gaming will reach new markets and clients around the world. This will be facilitated via IGT PlayDigital's leading and innovative Game Aggregation Platform.</p>
<p>The new collaboration comes as no surprise, considering that 7777 gaming continues to expand its list of games by delivering new content. To date, the company's portfolio of content surpasses 100 games and some of its most popular titles are Jinn, Fortunes of Rome, Hit the Pinata, Knights and Magic, Cash 40, Greenhats' Jackpot and Golden Scarab, among others.</p>
<p>In a statement released on February 20, 2023, IGT's President of iGaming, Gil Rotem, shared his excitement saying that the company is delighted to join forces with 7777 gaming. "Creating an exciting and extraordinary portfolio is key to engaging iGaming players," he added. In conclusion, Rotem pointed out: "We look forward to this collaboration and aim to work closely together to offer the next level of excitement to players around the world."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the collaboration brought excitement to 7777 gaming as well, with the company's CCO, Elena Shaterova, saying: "We at 7777 gaming are proud to engage in a partnership with IGT PlayDigital."</p>
<p>She added that the new partnership resonates well with the company's plans for further growth and expansion of its content to new audiences around the world. "We are looking forward to strengthening and developing this partnership further towards achieving common goals," said Shaterova in conclusion.</p>
<p>The new collaboration helps expand further IGT PlayDigital's platform offering. At the same time, the aggregator remains committed to adhering to responsible gambling regulations.</p>
<p>IGT PlayDigital is globally recognized as one of the biggest providers of content for the growing iGaming vertical. The company's platform offers not only a plethora of games but provides different data and analytics, as well as engagement tools that help its partner operators. Currently, IGT PlayDigital supplies content to more than 20 regulated markets around the world.</p>
<p>Details of the latest deal come after last week, 7777 gaming confirmed its plans for further expansion on a global scale. Just after one of the most-anticipated events within the gambling industry wrapped up, the ICE London 2023, the company confirmed it continues its expansion with entries in Africa and Asia.</p>
