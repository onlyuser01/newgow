    <h1>Sandia Casino And Resort Billionaire Casino Free Chips Spirit Lake Casino Nd Seminole Hard Rock Hote</h1>

<p>I hope you can help!!</p>
<p>I won in excess of â‚¬200,000 on 24.12.2021 on rolletto, I tried withdrawing and realised I could only withdraw 15000 per month. Back and forth with live chat and support service via email I managed to withdraw 7500 on the 25.12.2021 and another 7500 on the 27.12.2021. they told me it would be the 25.01.2022 I would next be able to with draw.</p>
<p>I requested the casino to put a loss limit on my account or a restriction from playing the casino. It's a massive win, I didn't want to waste the win nor did I want to gamble with them as it was already going to take some time to withdraw the funds, if I was to win more it would take longer.</p>
<p>It comes to the 25.12.2022 withdrawal date, I sign into my account, all permission to do anything has been removed. I contacted the casino via live chat, they told me I should request my withdrawal via the support email. I do that and get a response stating the proper team will contact you shortly, time passes I email again, a different agent responds - you case is being look at by the relevant team and someone will contact you very soon. I let a week pass, still nothing. Ive emailed since on numerous occasions having heard nothing from the relevant team and get the same response every time, someone from the relevant team will contact you soon, your case is being reviewed.</p>
<p>I find this very bizarre that noone from the proper or relevant team has contacted to say we have you case file etc and are reviewing your request. I feel I'm being fobbed off by the same excuse every time.</p>
<p>I hope you can support or help in anyway. I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
