<p>Markor Technology has teamed up with Relax Gaming to give a further boost to its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The alliance will allow Relax Gaming’s dedicated in-house content list with Markor’s vast network of online casino operators, including the studio’s signature titles, to wit Temple Tumble, and Money Train.</p>
<p>Building on a Brilliant Portfolio of Games</p>
<p>Markor Technology already has a brilliant library of games that features more than 5,000 online games for partner operators and their players to explore. The inclusion of Relax will give the platform an additional boost and help operators access content that their players will definitely like.</p>
<p>Commenting on this news in a press release shared with media representatives, Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield said that her company has built up a reputation for being one of the industry’s leaders in aggregation content and services. Partnering with some of the biggest names in iGaming is definitely a positive development. Summerfield added:</p>
<p>By bringing on board a brand with the global reputation and stature of Relax Gaming, we’ll be able to offer an even greater variety of top-quality titles to our online casino partners and we look forward to hearing the feedback from their players after they take some of these great new games for a spin. Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield</p>
<p>Relax Gaming for its part is an equally prominent developer and aggregation service provider. Commenting on this latest tie-up, Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard said that the company was delighted to be joining forces with Markor and hailed the success the company has achieved in aggregation services, despite being a fairly new market entry. Attard added:</p>
<p>With Markor’s recent acquisition of multiple licenses, as well as regulatory approval to work with Spanish operators, we hope our leading titles will prove a key driver in further expanding their brand. Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Markor Technology already holds licensees from multiple jurisdictions and can provide its services and content in the United Kingdom, Malta, and Gibraltar, and recently received a license from the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego, Spain’s gambling regulator. Interestingly, Relax Gaming is a leading aggregation platform that has amassed thousands of games to distribute with its own network of operators.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the company itself has been working to actively push its own in-house products with another aggregation platform. All of this highlights the importance of turning to aggregation solutions to help reduce the costs of integration and launches and drive awareness for individual products.</p>
