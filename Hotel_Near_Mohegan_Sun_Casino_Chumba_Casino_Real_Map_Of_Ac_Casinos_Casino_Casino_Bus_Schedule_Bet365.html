    <h1>Hotel Near Mohegan Sun Casino Chumba Casino Real Map Of Ac Casinos Casino Casino Bus Schedule Bet365</h1>

<p>I have been using the services of bet365 for about 20 years. During that time, I have had 3 accounts with them because of legislative and licensing changes that led to them opening, closing, and reopening their operations in Bulgaria. The old accounts were not transferred, and according to their instructions, users had to open new ones.</p>
<p>In 2020, I had an unpleasant incident - my current account was blocked, and their support responded quite rudely, telling me to withdraw my balance and leave. Due to the mentioned old accounts, someone expressed doubts about multi-accounting. In the subsequent correspondence, we clarified the issue, and my account was restored.</p>
<p>About 2 months ago, they introduced, I quote, "an additional layer of protection." In order to place bets, users are required to:</p>
<p>Install the bet365 authenticator app on their mobile phone, available at https://www.bet365authenticator.com.</p>
<p>Allow the app to determine their exact location.</p>
<p>Allow the browser on their computer access to their location.</p>
<p>Log into their accounts and scan the QR code that appears when attempting to place a bet using their phone.</p>
<p>I downloaded the app, but it turned out to be in conflict with the security system of my phone, and its installation was impossible without additional intervention. I decided not to take any risks and refrained from using this app. I simply waited for a month or two to see if this access system would change. I logged into my account just to check, without placing any bets or withdrawing my balance.</p>
<p>A few days ago, after consulting with a specialist, I disabled the security on my phone and installed the app. I managed to verify my location. However, in the meantime, I was asked for my personal number, ID card, and a selfie with the ID card in succession. I provided all of that.</p>
<p>I received 2 letters with conflicting content - the first stating that my account was fully verified, and then another one stating that the photos are being reviewed and to expect confirmation.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I found that I couldn't access my account. I spoke to the live chat, where they told me that my account had been closed due to "negative verification checks." I am the real owner of this account, I have provided real documents, and I can meet any other verification requirements - a video clip, phone conversation, or any messenger communication, etc. I exchanged another email with their support, expressing my arguments. Their response was that my account will remain closed, and I should contact them to request the withdrawal of my balance.</p>
<p>Since I have exhausted the dialogue with the bookmaker, I am turning to the Casino Guru team, requesting assistance in overcoming the verification issue with my account.</p>
