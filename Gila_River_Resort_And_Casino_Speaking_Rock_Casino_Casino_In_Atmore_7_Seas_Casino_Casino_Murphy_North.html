    <h1>Gila River Resort And Casino Speaking Rock Casino Casino In Atmore 7 Seas Casino Casino Murphy North</h1>

<p>Dear Alefriito,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I've checked the casino terms and conditions and I found this: https://sol.casino/en/terms</p>
<p>If the withdrawn amount exceeds 6 250 BRL, the Company has the right to carry out additional verification of the gaming transactions for a period of no more than 48 hours.</p>
<p>The Casino cannot guarantee the fulfilment of card payments in all cases, since card-issuing banks can block or reject transactions at their own discretion.</p>
<p>All current jackpot winnings are paid out in full as one payment provided that all conditions are met.</p>
<p>If the total amount of deposits is more than 10 000 BRL, we have a right to verify your identity.</p>
<p>If the total amount of deposits is more than 50 000 BRL we have a right to request a source of funds confirmation.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to require primary and secondary account verification at any time and to use additional tools and procedures for verification, if necessary. In order to verify your user account, the administration has the right to ask you to provide an ID document (including, but not limited to, a copy of your passport/ID card/any payment card used, recent public utility charge statement in your name or any other document confirming your identity). In addition, the Company reserves the right to ask you to confirm your identity via a video call or by sending your documents by mail. If these requirements are not fulfilled, the Company has the right to temporarily deactivate your user account until the requirements are fulfilled and/or close the account. If the information you provided is found to be inaccurate, the Company reserves the right to block your account and cancel withdrawals.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>I encourage you to complete the account verification, including additional verification if necessary when that is requested from you. Please let me know if you require any additional assistance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
