<p>Dear Megs12345,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your problem. I can only imagine how frustrating it might be for you, but please understand, that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. Each casino is unique and proceeds the verification process differently. It is understandable that the casino has to ask for additional documents if players change their home addresses.</p>
<p>Could you please indicate which documents exactly have you provided? Have you made any successful withdrawals before?</p>
<p>Additionally, please forward any relevant communication between you and the casino to kristina.s@casino.guru</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
