<p>Playson has inked a new partnership agreement with LasVegas, bringing its popular library of games to the Romanian operator’s database of players</p>
<p>The leading developer of cutting-edge, innovative gaming content present in more than 18 regulated jurisdictions has announced its collaboration with the Romanian operator as a means of strengthening its presence in the country.</p>
<p>Fresh Playson Releases to Reach the Romanian Market</p>
<p>According to the freshly-inked deal between the two parties, LasVegas will add Playson’s rich selection of top-tier games to its constantly growing players database in the country.</p>
<p>Both online and offline players visiting the largest network of elegantly designed gaming rooms in Romania will enjoy the chance to test out the cool variety of slots featuring different themes and game mechanics that have already proven their potential to drive engagement.</p>
<p>The list features some of Playson’s freshly released titles such as Treasures of Fire, Pirate Sharky, and Luxor Gold: Hold and Win, among other player-favorite games like Mammoth Peak Hold and Win, Bozo Cats, Pirate Chest Hold and Win, Solar Queen, Book of Gold Multichance, and Wolf Power Megaways.</p>
<p>By adding LasVegas to its roster of Romanian operators, Playson will further establish itself as one of the leading suppliers in the regulated market in the region while preparing the ground for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The provider’s chief customer officer Tamas Kusztos spoke about their well-established presence in Romania, calling the fresh partnership with the operator one that would reaffirm Playson “as a leading provider within the Balkans.”</p>
<p>Ready for a “Fantastic Collaboration”</p>
<p>Kusztos also praised “LasVegas’ ability to prove its worth in the last few years and turn into a “brilliant online casino” while expressing their eagerness to kickstart what they hope would be a fantastic collaboration.</p>
<p>LasVegas’ chief executive officer Radu-Birsan Alexandru said they were “delighted to forge a partnership with Playson,” putting special emphasis on their rich portfolio of highly respected games in all parts of the planet.</p>
<p>Owned and operated by Dimsacon LTD, a Malta-registered company, LasVegas has chosen “SKY IS NO LIMIT” as its motto. With over two decades of experience in the Romanian gambling market, the gambling company has been awarded multiple titles in the past years, including a prize for “The brand with the most dynamic development in the gaming industry” and “The best gambling operator outside of Bucharest”.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Playson inked a content integration deal with Grand Casino Baden in Switzerland. Last month, Playson announced the launch of its games with Bingoal in the Netherlands.</p>
