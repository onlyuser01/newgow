<p>Monterrey vs. Nashville SC is the that will decide which of these two will play in the 2023 Leagues Cup Final</p>
<p>Monterrey is the team that knocked out two champions in the last two rounds of the 2023 Leagues Cup – MLS champ LAFC and Liga MX champ UANL Tigres. Plus, Monterrey is the only Leagues Cup team that’s won every game in the 90 minutes of regular time. This explains why the Mexican team is seen as the betting favorite in the semifinal duel with Nashville SC.</p>
<p>However, the Boys in Gold mustn’t be underestimated as they’ve been in fabulous form lately. They’re coming off a 5-0 win over Minnesota United in the previous round.</p>

<p>Monterrey Determined to Show Liga MX is Better Than MLS</p>
<p>Monterrey is the only Mexican team left in the 2023 Leagues Cup, but can these guys go all the way? They’ve been brilliant since the start of the tournament, winning every single game in regulation. The most impressive thing is that Monterrey has faced some real heavyweights of North American soccer so far.</p>
<p>After a relatively easy job in the group phase – against Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders, and Portland Timbers – Monterrey played against two very tough opponents in the knockout stage of the Leagues Cup.</p>
<p>First, “Rayados” played against the champions of the 2023 Mexican Liga MX Clausura, UANL Tigres. It was a very close game, but Monterrey won 1-0 thanks to the goal from the penalty spot by its new playmaker Sergio Canales in the 7th minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>Then, in the quarterfinal of the 2023 Leagues Cup, Monterrey defeated the champion of the MLS, Los Angeles FC. It was another incredibly tense game, which saw the Mexicans pull back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.</p>
<p>Nashville SC Fans Putting Their Hopes in Hany Mukhtar</p>
<p>Hany Mukhtar is one of the best players in the MLS, and the biggest star of Nashville SC. The playmaker put on a vintage show in the 5-0 demolition of Minnesota United in the quarterfinal, which saw him score one goal and make three assists.</p>
<p>He was also very good against Club America in the round of 16, in which his team won by penalties after 2-2 in regulation. With him in top form, the “Boys in Gold” look capable of scoring against literally any opponent in the Leagues Cup.</p>
<p>However, Nashville SC just isn’t great at the back. These guys have conceded eight goals so far in the Leagues Cup. Plus, in their last five games in the 2023 MLS, they allowed a total of eight goals.</p>
<p>Monterrey vs. Nashville SC Prediction</p>
<p>According to Transfermarkt, the estimated value of Monterrey’s roster is roughly $88 million. That’s almost twice as much as the value of Nashville SC ($48M). Knowing this – and taking into account their performances at the 2023 Leagues Cup – it’s only logical to assume Monterrey will triumph on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Pick: Monterrey to win</p>
