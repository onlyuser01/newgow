<p>Dear Daiividhyseni,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. I checked the responsible gambling section and I found this:</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion:</p>
<p>Suppose you get diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from all gambling services for a different reason. In that case, we want to assist you in your abstinence from gambling services, especially if they become harmful to you. "Self-Exclusion" means that you exclude yourself from all gambling-related services out of your own choice. You, the Company, or a third-party partner cannot undo this exclusion for a set amount of time unless certain conditions are met. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from all gambling-related services, please message our Roobet support team which will exclude you immediately. Please provide them a period between 6 (six) months and 5 (five) years as duration for your self-exclusion.</p>
<p>Additionally, our Roobet support team will explain all future steps and what is needed from you. The Roobet support team will make it as easy and fast as possible for you. As self-exclusion is a significant limitation of your account, we must ensure you are sure and not someone else is asking on your behalf. If our team can be of any assistance to you, they gladly will. You can find the contact details at the bottom, in the contact section of this Policy.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the Self-Exclusion is permanent for your chosen period. The exclusion can and will not be undone for your own protection unless you complete a multiple step process during which your mental state will be assessed to ensure you are in a state of mind that allows responsible gambling. Please understand this evaluation will take multiple days. Additionally, an employee of the Company may judge at their sole discretion if you are in the mental state to participate in gambling services again or not and refuse to grant you access again. You are solely responsible for all damages and losses occurring to you through misinforming the Company's staff members or gambling again. Those evaluations are necessary to ensure you have the time to think about the consequences of participating in gambling services, not limited to games of chance, games of skill, games of risk and sports bets, including esports again, and do not act out of an urge to gamble or a spontaneous decision.</p>
<p>During Self-Exclusion, you are not allowed to create a new account or access any service on the website. Every attempt to create a new account on the website or any attempt to participate in any of the gambling services offered on it during Self-Exclusion is a violation of our terms. It will result in the permanent ban of your original account as well as your newly created or used account."</p>
<p>I also see that in this section are stated these contact emails:</p>
<p>"Contact</p>
<p>If you have any questions, issues, suggestions, problems, or feedback, feel free to contact our Roobet Support Team and our Roobet Compliance Team at any time:</p>
<p>By E-Mail: support@roobet.com</p>
<p>By E-Mail: CS@roobet.com"</p>
<p>Could you please clarify why you sent your request to the Gmail email address? Also, how many hours/days passed after you requested self-exclusion until the casino blocked your account?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
