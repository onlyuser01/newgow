<p>Dear Casino Guru</p>
<p>The 30. june I registered at Goodman casino and started playing</p>
<p>When I was done, I had a balance of 980 euro, that I decided to withdraw. I sent in all the documentation they asked, which they approved. Its important to say, that I did not play with any bonus and the only game I was playing was their Blackjack software from BGaming called "Blackjack Surrender".</p>
<p>Some days after I tried to connect to the site and get a message saying "account disabled". At that time I have got no information from them about that, so I was really confused.</p>
<p>I contacted their mail support and they told me, that it was closed, since they have detected another account releated to me. I told them that it was right, but that I never had played any games or used any bonuses with that account since it was closed with no further informations seconds after the registration.</p>
<p>Some days after I decided to try to register again and it works with no problem. After that, they approved my documents and allowed me to play, but when I wanted to withdraw some winnings they decided to take away my winnings and just sent me back my deposits.</p>
<p>The casino will for sure use the excuse "youre only allowed to have 1 account", but in this case theire have been absolutely no activity with the first account, which they closed seconds after it was open with no reason from the casino at all. Therefore I had absolutly no benefidts by creating a new account; I just wanted to play and had no bad intentions at all. How should I even have that, when I used no bonus and only placed my bet at the same game; Blackjack Surrender?</p>
<p>When they can do such thing, it makes it a win/win situation for the casino. Do I loose, my money are gone, do I win, they use an unfair reason not to give me my money.</p>
<p>Please help me Casino Guru</p>
