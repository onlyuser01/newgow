<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has released the latest numbers for the month of May 2023, reporting a total of $479,377,660 in gross gaming revenue from across all available forms of gambling. This was a 7.05% increase from the numbers posted in May 2022, and indicative of the stateâ€™s sustained growth and improvement insofar as its gambling industry is concerned.</p>
<p>In terms of top performers, there were hardly any surprises there, with the Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course topping the chart with $74,356,727, improving on its May 2022 results by 18.33%. Last May, the venue posted results of $62,840,690.</p>
<p>Next, there was Valley Forge Casino Resort, which collected $64,218,231 over the period, or a 21.71% gain on the $52,763,583 posted last year. Third was Parx Casino with $58,749,678, which was a 2.18% improvement on the $57,495,369 posted in May 2022. Overall, the majority of properties saw improvements on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>The ones that did not were the Wind Creek Bethlehem property, which lost 5.24% from its momentum from the same period last year and posted $46,271,657 in May 2023 compared to $48,832,492 in May 2022. The biggest loss in terms of percentage contraction was registered by Presque Isle Downs and Casino which collected $8,911,696 in May 2023 compared to $10,768,663 in May 2022, or down 17.24%.</p>
<p>Overall, the PGCB provided a detailed breakdown of individual segments in the industry and how they performed over the month of May. The regulator broke down the segments into several main verticals, including retail slots revenue, iGaming slots revenue, retail tables revenue, sports wagering revenue, as well as iGaming tables revenue, video gaming terminals revenue, iGaming poker revenue, and fantasy contests revenue.</p>
<p>A noticeable contraction in performance was registered with retail tables revenue which posted $81,648,355 compared to $88,577,662, or down 7.82%. The contraction in the table games vertical was noticeable in other states as well, including New Jersey, which also saw its monthly results for May in this vertical slow down.</p>
<p>Retail slots revenue improved, however, to $210,862,268 from $205,666,269 a year before. The real winner was iGaming slot revenue, however, which now hit $100,590,742 from $78,211,521 in May 2022, an overall improvement of 28.61%, and in line with the fast adoption of iGaming games</p>
