<p>Wild Robo Factory review</p>
<p>Quick verdict Cute robots and a dystopian setting combine in this pretty slot with reasonable RTP (96.40%) and medium volatility.</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Robo Factory exists in a world beyond the singularity. In a time when robots make robots to make other robots. The slot takes place on the factory floor of one of these industrial powerhouses.</p>
<p>The adorable robots build other adorable robots, while the player tries to mix and match parts across the reels.</p>
<p>Welcome to the future!</p>
<p>Big win with the Twin Wild Robo symbol</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics exude a lot of character for such simple designs.</p>
<p>The animations are clear, full, and charming, with a great deal of work put into making the various robos feel alive.</p>
<p>The musical backing is a 1980s style track that seems highly evocative of the original Blade Runner movie. An appropriate point of reference for artificially created beings.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a five reel slot with four rows and 25 win lines.</p>
<p>Beyond a free spins bonus game, there are some interesting random features thrown into the mix, that work well with the theme (details below).</p>
<p>A conveyor belt at the bottom of the screen carries Wild and Free Spin symbols along the bottom rows, moving them one space per spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Wilds only appear on the conveyor belt at the bottom of the screen and only during Free Spins or random feature Robo Respins. They come in various heights (covering the bottom row of a reel, the bottom two rows, etc…) and various shapes. They move from right to left, one space per spin.</p>
<p>Twin Wild Robo or a double reel wild symbol</p>
<p>A Free Spin bot exists that moves in the same way. The Free Spin Bot, plays the same as the Free Spin symbol on the main reels.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols trigger the Free Spin bonus. The Free Spin bonus does not have a set number of Free Spins. Instead, the player is awarded 5 "Robos" for three Scatters symbols, 10 Robos for four Scatters, and 15 for five Scatters.</p>
<p>Each Robo can be either a Wild or a Free Spin bot. They are released one by one onto the conveyor belt and move left by one reel after every free spin.</p>
<p>When a Robo falls off the left of the reels, the Robo count is reduced by one. The Free Spins end when the last Robo falls off the left of the reel.</p>
<p>System Overload random feature works only within free spins bonus and reverses the conveyor belt, which then runs backwards and returns Robos to the player.</p>
<p>One of the random features swaps low paying symbols for high paying symbols</p>
<p>Last random feature appears in the base game. Symbol Swap transforms low paying symbols into high paying ones of the same color for a guaranteed win.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.4%, well over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.05 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, but the reasonable RTP somewhat counters this slot’s weakness in this regard.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Wild Robo Factory slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A clever bonus system and fancy graphics disguise the fact that this is a fairly ordinary slot.</p>
<p>That said, fancy graphics go a long way to keeping a player interested, and the RTP isn’t too bad.</p>
<p>We would prefer a bit more volatility from this slot. But it is certainly not a bad slot despite this.</p>
