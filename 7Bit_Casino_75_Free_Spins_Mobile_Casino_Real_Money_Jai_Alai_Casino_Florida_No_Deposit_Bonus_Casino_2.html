<p>Checkd Group, a leading iGaming company, has teamed up with Xtreme push, an established leader in player acquisition and retention.</p>
<p>The partnership should result in an increase for the Betting Hub app and UK and US brands, an official press statement details. Xtremepush focuses on omnichannel customer engagement platform solutions that should enable Checkd Group to pursue more ambitious player-acquisition strategies.</p>
<p>Building Tailored Approach in Personalization with Xtremepush</p>
<p>Xtremepush analyzes mobile and web users, collates data, and offers data-driven and contextualized insights that then translate into personalized messaging which leads to better results for partners.</p>
<p>The engagement specialist also prides itself on delivering what it calls a “hyper-personalized approach” which leads to a significant boost in online conversion rates. Checkd Group’s Betting Hub app will not be the only one to benefit, with the FlashPicks, Footy Accumulators, and The Winners Enclosure websites benefiting from the technology on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Checkd Group should leverage this new expertise and partnership to boost its own operator partners in engaging with their customer bases. Commenting on the partnership, Checkd Group Alex Beecham said that the company was always on the lookout to improve its engagement strategies and that Xtremepush gave it a significant improvement.</p>
<p>This has to do with the way Checkd Group personalizes and tailors content. “This new partnership serves as further evidence of our desire to continue product innovation with CRM solutions that will increase the active player base for our operator partners,” Beecham said.</p>
<p>Xtremepush’s Jack Oliver was similarly pleased with the new tie-up. He highlighted the strengths of the platform and added:</p>
<p>Our platform provides Checkd Group with the advanced toolset that it needs to further increase the retention potential across all their brands by delivering relevant notifications and emails to its customers. Xtremepush’s Jack Oliver</p>
<p>Oliver is confident about what he has described as a mutually successful partnership moving forward. Checkd Group has been looking to expand and grow its geographical footprint over the past months.</p>
<p>The company made a successful debut in Ontario, Canada, and has pivoted strongly towards the regulated sports betting markets in the United States. The addition of Xtremepush is another guided effort to achieve further recognition and reach.</p>
