    <h1>Play Casino Games For Real Money Casino In Battle Creek Michigan Long Island Casino Eagle Aruba Reso</h1>

<p>Goodnight. I opened an account at luckydreams.com casino, near the beginning of the month of September, the account is verified.</p>
<p>I made some deposits and also a withdrawal at this casino, all by skrill.</p>
<p>For reasons I don't know, my skrill account blocked on my mobile phone, and sometimes I made one or another deposit by paysafecard.</p>
<p>On one of these deposits, I made 900 euros in winnings, on which I requested withdrawal, which was denied to me as the casino had no documents from my paysafecard account, and that the last deposit had been made by that method. I sent the documents, they were verified and approved, and I asked for a new withdrawal of 850 euros, by skrill, which was denied me again, and that would have to be done by bank transfer, as it had no cashout option.</p>
<p>I asked through livechat, because it couldn't be by skrill, as I had already made deposits and withdrawals through this method, and the agent said that the withdrawal would have to be done, respecting the method made in the last deposit, than the previous deposits by skrill they were irrelevant, the last one was that it would be valid, and since there was no cashout available through paysafecard, the only way I could withdraw the money would be by bank transfer, or not at all.</p>
<p>So, following this rule that I was completely unaware of and which does not exist in the terms and conditions of the casino, despite having 850 balance in the account, I made a deposit of 20 through the skrill account, placed bets worth around 200 euros, ending with balance of 800 euros, requesting again the withdrawal by skrill, as the last deposit was by skrill.</p>
<p>Rejected again, only by bank transfer are they allowed to withdraw the money, despite my deposits and withdrawals by skrill.</p>
