<p>Dear Thomas.</p>
<p>We are here to help players but also casinos to solve their complaints. We are doing it for free and based on all proofs what we get.</p>
<p>17 January I asked you to provide us with an example of your communication with the casino, you ignored this message. When I asked Nick, he showed us what you wrote to their live chat and other proofs which support what he wrote here. I understand your situation, but without cooperation from your side (and by cooperation I mean sending us proofs), we can't help you. Justice is blind, and when I compare evidence what you gave us (nothing) and what Nick gave us, it is pretty clear.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't understand at all is why are you writing this complaint now after half a year. If you wrote to us after one month of having problems with the withdrawal, we would be able to solve your complaint. After you lost all the money, it's too late.</p>
<p>From what you wrote:</p>
<p>"NETELLER payment request dated 22/11/2019"</p>
<p>If you are trying to get your money half a year it means that you submitted your first withdrawal in August 2019, am I correct?</p>
<p>From what Nick wrote:</p>
<p>"Neteller account provided was not eligible for payment, and details for wire payment were requested."</p>
<p>So why you still tried to use Neteller for withdrawing the funds when you should do a wire transfer?</p>
