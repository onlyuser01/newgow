    <h1>Casino In Tennessee Casino Hotels In Oklahoma Soundtrack From Casino Casinos In Scottsdale Arizona C</h1>

<p>Good morning :</p>
<p>I introduce myself Maria Rosa P<strong><em>* D</em></strong> v<strong><em> with Dni 09</em></strong>* I would like to file a formal complaint against Platin Casino.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I have been registered in said casino because they have blocked me and I cannot go in to verify the date or the deposits I have made in the past.</p>
<p>After sending them all this documentation, they have asked me what I have described to them and what is in my possession, as well as the emails that they have sent me and I have sent them, they have decided to permanently block the account because they say the following</p>
<p>(Your player account has been permanently closed due to a violation of our general terms and conditions.)</p>
<p>When article 7 paragraph 3 of its conditions says the following:</p>
<p>Players agree to always comply with the General Conditions and also confirm that:</p>
<p>They do not act in the interests of third parties</p>
<p>They do not use funds from criminal activities</p>
<p>do not use bank accounts, debit or credit cards that they are not authorized to use</p>
<p>do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to 8PE systems to alter its code or content in any way</p>
<p>They will not participate or organize any criminal action against 8PE, its affiliates and its Players</p>
<p>And that is not my case because it is signed and allows me to use both the Paypal account and the credit card.</p>
<p>I plan to file a complaint General Directorate of Gambling Regulation</p>
<p>I am attaching only 3 files of the emails they sent me, but I have many more</p>
