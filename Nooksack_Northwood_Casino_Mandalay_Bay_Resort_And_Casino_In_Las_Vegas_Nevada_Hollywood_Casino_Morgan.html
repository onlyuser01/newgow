    <h1>Nooksack Northwood Casino Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino In Las Vegas Nevada Hollywood Casino Morgan</h1>

<p>Earlier this month, Stakelogic inked an agreement with BetCity.nl. Now, the company inked a second deal to supply its full suite of content for Play North’s to new Dutch brand BataviaCasino. The collaboration will help Stakelogic solidify its presence in the market but also bring unique content for Dutch customers.</p>
<p>BataviaCasino to Offer Stakelogic Content</p>
<p>Innovative online casino games developer Stakelogic announced today a new deal under which it will provide its content for Play North’s new Dutch brand BataviaCasino.nl. As a result of the agreement, Stakelogic will increase its presence in the Dutch iGaming market. The new collaboration complements a recent deal inked between Stakelogic and BetCity.nl earlier this month. Under the new agreement, Stakelogic will provide its full suite of games for Bataviacasino.nl. The deal became possible thanks to an already existing partnership between Play North and Relax Gaming. In this collaboration, Relax Gaming will provide the gaming infrastructure for the new website.</p>
<p>“The move emphasizes our intention to make Stakelogic the go-to software provider for Dutch online casinos and further strengthens our position in this rapidly developing market.” Olga Bajela, CCO, Stakelogic</p>
<p>Olga Bajela, CCO at Stakelogic said that the company is delighted to bring its full suite of games to Bataviacasino.nl via the Relax Gaming platform. She stressed that this move reaffirms Stakelogic’s commitment to becoming the “go-to software provider for Dutch online casinos.” In conclusion, Bajela said that the recent deal further solidifies the company’s presence in the continuously growing market.</p>
<p>Play North’s director, Patrick Azzopardi, said that the company expects the new casino to provide “an unrivaled online gaming experience to Dutch players.” He added that the way to achieve this is by joining forces with leading software providers such as Stakelogic. In conclusion, Azzopardi said that the new collaboration will give players “access to a great collection of games packed with exciting concepts and rewarding features.”</p>
<p>Dutch Players Can Now Access Unique Game Modes and Classic Slot Games</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Dutch customers can now access premium games from Stakelogic. Those titles feature innovative pay line technology, as well as unique game modes. Moreover, customers will also be able to enjoy Stakelogic’s full range of classic slots that feature fruit-themed and retro games with multiple bonus features. The new partnership will also grant customers access to the long-anticipated games Apes of Doom and Joker Drop. The two titles are set to be released in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The new deal will also see Dutch players access Stakelogic’s patented gameplay mode Super StakeTM. This optional feature can be purchased by players who decide to double their current bet while playing some slot games. As a result, those players can access different bonuses or “buy directly into the bonus round in some cases,” the company explained.</p>
<p>This unique feature is available within highly popular games such as Extreme MegawaysTM, Midas Wilds, 9 Pyramids of Fortune and more. The functionality allows Stakelogic to distinguish itself from its competitors on the Dutch market. Moreover, the recent deal is Stakelogic’s second agreement with a Dutch-licensed company. Undoubtedly, with this move, Stakelogic is looking to solidify its presence in the country while the iGaming market continues to grow.</p>
