<p>Liverpool vs. Arsenal is the match that wraps up this weekend’s Premier League action. It’s played on Sunday, April 9, 2023, at Anfield</p>
<p>Liverpool is without a win since March 5, when they demolished Manchester United 7-0. It was the last time the Reds played at Anfield. They’re back home this Sunday, but oddsmakers don’t think they’re going to do anything like that this time. Why? Because their opponent is the Premier League table leader, Arsenal.</p>

<p>The Reds Coming Home After Over a Month</p>
<p>It’s been more than a month since the Reds played at Anfield. It happened on May 5, 2023, when they defeated the Red Devils 7-0. Since then, they played four games on the road, losing three of those and drawing one.</p>
<p>Two of those losses happened in the Premier League (to Bournemouth and Man City), and one in the Champions League (to Real Madrid). In their most recent game, they drew 0-0 with Chelsea in the EPL.</p>
<p>They didn’t score against Chelsea, but the Reds offense sure does look dangerous. It’s because pretty much all of their forwards are fit, which hasn’t been the case in a while. Unfortunately, they still do have some problems with injuries in other departments. For instance, they’re going to be without three midfielders on Sunday – Thiago Alcantara, Naby Keita, and Stefan Bajcetic.</p>
<p>The Gunners Going All-In on the Prem</p>
<p>They’re out of the Europa League, as well as the FA Cup and the EFL Cup. What this means is that the only competition they can win is the Premier League. And they’re serious about doing it!</p>
<p>The Gunners are sitting in the No. 1 position in the EPL standings with six points more than the second-placed Man City, who do have one game in hand.</p>
<p>With nine more rounds in the 2022-23 Premier League, the race for the title is far from being over. The good news for the Gunners’ fans is that their boys have been terrific in the English top flight. They’re rising on a 6-win streak in the Prem, scoring four goals in four of those games.</p>
<p>They might not necessarily score as many goals on Sunday, but we can definitely see them break Liverpool’s defense. Whether that’s going to be enough for another three points, we can’t say for certain.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>This game screams “draw.” The two teams are very similar in terms of player quality, not to mention that both are very motivated. The Reds wanna do great in front of their fans at Anfield, while the Gunners are in need of points to continue their title challenge.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool and Arsenal to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
