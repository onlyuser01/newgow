    <h1>Free Casino Games That Pay Real Money Jazz Casino Fortune Online Casino Red Rock Casino Rooms Free C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>On 5/12/2022 I decided to deposit 20f at MansionCasino. It was my lucky day as I managed to win just over 1800f. (attached ss)</p>
<p>Playing for some time, I decided to withdraw 1700f, and I think I had less than 100f left in my casino account.</p>
<p>When withdrawing this amount, of course, nothing happened that could suggest that I would have such a problem that my money would finally be sent to me. (noting that I have an account for about 2 years, I've never had any problems. Even more than a month ago, one weekend I lost ¬£150, and the next I managed to win ¬£600, which I cashed out without any problems, after 30 hours I had the money in my account).</p>
<p>After an intermittent 3 hours of playing, I was suddenly automatically logged out of the casino without being able to log back in.</p>
<p>I got a message that my account has been temporarily blocked.</p>
<p>When contacting via chat, I couldn't get an answer: Why was my account banned for no reason?</p>
<p>The agent, not knowing why and what is the reason that it happened - asked me meaningless questions, such as ''Are you okay?''</p>
<p>(of course, I won it's joy, although when I lost a moment ago 150f no one spoke :D)</p>
<p>Not getting a specific answer, I decided to contact you by phone the next day.</p>
<p>The next day, I found out that I have to undergo another verification without any reason, sending all possible documents + I will have to make a phone call for additional verification.</p>
<p>After sending the documents on 6/12, I was waiting for any information, but only taking matters into my own hands and contacting again by phone (9/12/2022, about an hour, two on the phone) I find out that only a statement from the bank has arrived and nothing else.. (of course I have an e-mail from that day and you can see all the documents attached)</p>
<p>Of course, without thinking, I sent the documents again and ... And this action, along with making the phone call, I repeated some 6-7 times, because the agent I spoke to claimed that there were no attachments ... Well, 2 finally succeeded! !</p>
<p>Not quite ... I had to wait for the verification of documents, where, as you know, I managed to do it only by spending a lot of time on the phone - a week later, on 16.12 and I will add that the phone verification was also approved.</p>
<p>I fulfilled everything they asked for, even though I dealt with each case after the time they reserve as to how long it may take.</p>
<p>Today is December 23, it's been 18 days and I'm still fighting and I don't know what to do anymore, because every phone call ends with information that I have to wait and they can't say how much? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why should I wait and what if they verified me again, I would like to get my money from the payout (1800f) as well as regain access to the account where I still have 65f.</p>
<p>Calling on 21.12 I started to wonder if someone was kidding me? The agent over the phone informed me that they have the right to respond to the complaint within 30 days - but I didn't make any complaint, so at this point I stopped feeling fair.</p>
