    <h1>Clearwater Casino Lewiston Venetian Resort Hotel Casino Casino Montreal Black Hawk Casino Hotel Casi</h1>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>now that you provided more insights it makes more sense to me. Though I did not "accuse" you of being uncooperative, it was a demonstration of what would seem suspicious when it comes to verification. To me, it seems that the casino simply needs an additional personal document to verify you. Did you tell them that you don't have the password?</p>
<p>But what I already explained is normal and the casino can ask for additional documents to make sure that KYC is clear because it's their responsibility to prove that it's "really" you. Since the casinos don't have the luxury of meeting you face to face, such situations simply happen.</p>
<p>If you feel that the casino is unfair to you, submit a complaint, then we shall all see the response. I do not know what seems to be wrong with your driving license, I would ask the casino about that. Anyway, we do not motivate any players to play in casinos, we review casinos, and part of the review is to inform about allowed and restricted countries.</p>
<p>I honestly think that punishing a casino for being precise with KYC would not be good, we penalize casinos that are acting against fair gambling. A appreciate your concern of course.</p>
<p>Feel free and read more about the fair gambling codex here.</p>
