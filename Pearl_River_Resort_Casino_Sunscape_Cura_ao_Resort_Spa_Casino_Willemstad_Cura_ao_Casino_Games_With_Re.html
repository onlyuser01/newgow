<p>The 33-year-old was booked at the Clark County Detention Center, TMZ Sports reported.</p>
<p>Jones is charged with two counts of violating a temporary protective order related to domestic violence, according to Las Vegas TV station KSNV.</p>
<p>He apparently posted bond on Friday and wasn’t listed as being incarcerated at the Clark County Detention Center as of Friday morning.</p>
<p>Jones is next scheduled to appear in local court on December 4.</p>
<p>Jones Reportedly Hospitalized</p>
<p>Jones was recently placed in a mental hospital and given medications, TMZ Sports added. He didn’t want to be a patient there and didn’t want the medications, according to the report.</p>
<p>Jones also missed the first two games of the regular season, KSNV reported. He recently was placed on the Raiders’ reserve/non-football illness list, the report added. He was recently seen crying on social media, the report added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Jones also lashed out at various individuals, used obscenities, and criticized the decision by the Raiders to keep him from the team’s gym.</p>
<p>The Raiders sent a crisis response team to his residence after his online outbursts, according to the Bleacher Report. A health professional, identified by Jones as Dr. Heather Thanepohn, went to his home and spoke to him, the report said. She apparently told him he was “in danger,” the Bleacher Report added.</p>
<p>Raiders Head Coach Josh McDaniels wouldn’t talk about Jones’s situation during a Friday press conference.</p>
<p>“Nothing changed on our end in terms of, you know, the status and everything else,” McDaniels said. “He’s where he is. I’m not up to speed on everything.”</p>
<p>Legal Matter</p>
<p>“The Raiders are hopeful that Chandler Jones receives the care that he needs. He, his family, and all those involved are in our thoughts,” the team added in a recent statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “As this is now a legal matter, we will not be providing further comment.”</p>
<p>McDaniels previously called the incidents with Jones a “private matter” and a “personal situation.”</p>
<p>College, Pro Career</p>
<p>Jones played college football at Syracuse University. He was later selected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He also played for the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
<p>In 2022, Jones agreed to a three-year, $51 million contract with the Raiders.</p>
