<p>Instant Win Gaming (IWG) has completed its InstantRGS integration, which has made it possible for the company to deliver player favorite InstantGames to the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG). IWG is working with the OLG based on the terms of a newly minted supply contract which will see the developer deploy an array of games.</p>
<p>OLG Adds Brand New Products by IWG</p>
<p>The partnership also marks entry into the 28th jurisdiction for IWG. Eight of these markets are in Canada where IWG has a strong pull with local lottery operators, including the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), the Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC), and Loto-Québec to name a few. The company is now building up on its presence by adding Ontario following the issuance of a license by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).</p>
<p>IWG is known for developing fresh games in huge volumes, but the company is also going to seek and elevate the experience by adding its dedicated technology solutions, to wit Instant Jackpot and InstantLink. Essentially, these solutions make it possible to create fresh jackpot experiences that are based on in-house games.</p>
<p>The OLG will also have access to yet another solution known simply as the InstantPulse which is designed to update eInstant visuals at pre-determined moments. Entry into the market is not random either. The province of Ontario is expected to be one of the biggest iGaming frontiers in the North American market. Even though the second quarter results for the province weren’t as impressive as initially hoped for, Ontario’s iGaming potential is huge, to say the least.</p>
<p>IWG and OLG Are Both Happy with the Opportunity</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, OLG senior director, iCasino &amp; iLottery Andrew Darley explained that securing products from IWG will immediately make the OLG.ca proposition more competitive. He added:</p>
<p>We are excited to continue to grow our customer base with IWG’s products because 100% of OLG profits are reinvested back into the province. So, when you play OLG.ca, you play for Ontario. OLG senior director, iCasino &amp; iLottery Andrew Darley</p>
<p>This partnership was also welcomed by IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher who was excited to see the company enter Ontario. The OLG is an incredible opportunity for IWG, he noted. IWG’s own track record, the company feels confident that the eInstants and lottery audiences at OLG will truly appreciate the products that the company can deploy. “We have exciting plans to help OLG truly differentiate itself as the single lottery operator in the province,” Fisher said.</p>
