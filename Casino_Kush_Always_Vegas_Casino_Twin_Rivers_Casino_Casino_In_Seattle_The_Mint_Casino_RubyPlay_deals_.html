    <h1>Casino Kush Always Vegas Casino Twin Rivers Casino Casino In Seattle The Mint Casino RubyPlay deals</h1>

<p>RubyPlay, an online iGaming studio, has entered into a new content alliance with PokerStars, a brand that is typically known for its presence in the online poker vertical. For several years now, however, PokerStars has been building up its online casino platform.</p>
<p>This is precisely what the tie-up with RubyPlay is about. PokerStars will now benefit from RubyPlay’s extensive portfolio of games, the companies shared in an email press release. RubyPlay has developed more than 80 excellent slot games and it’s licensed to operate in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>PokerStars is going to bring RubyPlay’s content to multiple markets. Some of the jurisdictions mentioned in the official statement include Ontario, Canada, Spain, Italy, Romania, and of course, the United Kingdom, where PokerStars has been building up significant momentum in the regulated iGaming market.</p>
<p>PokerStars previously strengthened its casino platform with content by Push Gaming. The new partnership will see RubyPlay deliver at least several prominent games to the operator, including Diamond Explosion 7s and Shake Shake Money Tree and Royal Griffin. PokerStars is big on branding, and the companies have agreed to create four titles that will be bespoke options for the operator.</p>
<p>This, PokerStars believes, will help the company further enhance its presence in important markets and set itself apart from other iGaming operators. RubyPlay has a strong reputation for building games that are loved by the players and that give companies the opportunity to expand strongly into regulated markets.</p>
<p>"PokerStars is one of the world’s leading operator brands and is respected by players worldwide," said RubyPlay Chief Executive Officer Trevor Ginsberg. PokerStars has been doing well in terms of growing its footprint in the regulated online casino sector.</p>
<p>In January, the company signed a similar content partnership with Spinomenal, focusing on the United Kingdom. PokerStars is likely to continue securing new partnerships with content providers as it seeks to scale its online casino offer over the coming months.</p>
