<p>Boldplay has inked an agreement with Daintree Gaming that will allow it to host its games on Betorspin and other global platforms</p>
<p>The fast-expanding software developer that offers omni-channel gaming solutions and innovative in-house jackpots, Boldplay, has signed a content distribution deal with the Curacao-based online operator, Daintree Gaming.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the latter will host the developer’s entire line-up of casino games on all of its global platforms, starting with Betorspin. In the following months, additional Daintree Gaming-powered online gambling sites will host Boldplay’s signature releases.</p>
<p>In March, Boldplay announced it reached a new milestone by obtaining a Romanian gaming license from ONJN and thus entering the country’s quickly growing iGaming market.</p>
<p>Hosting Boldplay’s Catalog, “a Significant Milestone” for Daintree Gaming</p>
<p>Daintree Gaming’s head of product, Rob Antill, commented on the news, explaining that the partnership represents “a significant milestone” for them that should allow them to provide players with a more versatile selection of games while fostering their success in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Boldplay’s chief executive officer, Valli Fragoso, also expressed similar feelings of delight for striking the agreement with Daintree and being able to see their games be distributed across their massive range of platforms.</p>
<p>Fragaso added that the new partnership should allow them to form more ties with their audiences via Betorspin and the additional global operators that will follow suit in the upcoming months, which should contribute to their goal of becoming one of the leading providers on the market.</p>
<p>Boldplay’s Freshest Release, Cakeshop Cascade, Already on Betorspin</p>
<p>Daintree Gaming’s Betorspin brand has already introduced its players to one of Boldplay’s latest hit releases, Cakeshop Cascade, a 5×3 video slot game with 20 paylines, the iconic popular cascading reels mechanic, and multipliers of up to 50x.</p>
<p>The provider’s collection also consists of a vast variety of slots, table games, virtual scratch cards, and keno games, with titles like 9 Planet Shockers, Surfing Beauties Bingo, Warriors and Warlocks, Cyborg City, Wildscapes, American Roulette, 10-Hand Video Poker, Baccarat, and Holmes and Moriarty Scratch.</p>
<p>The library also includes premium Jackpot slots, Superpays, Superpot, and Supersweep games, with options like Pretty Diamonds Superpays, 1 Don House Suupersweep, Gold Saloon Superpot, 500 BC Sparta Supersweep, Gold Greek Superpays on top of the list.</p>
<p>Speed Heist, Splatzz, Cam Carter and the Wheel of Wonder are upcoming games waiting to be released by the same studio.</p>
<p>Last month, LuckyStreak announced a similar content distribution agreement with Daintree Gaming for the former’s live casino and slots content to reach the latter’s players across all brands, starting with Betorspin and Betwiz.</p>
