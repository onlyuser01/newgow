    <h1>Oceans Casino Ac Casino Royale Las Vegas Casino Near Sedona Az Casino In Albuquerque New Mexico Myrt</h1>

<p>Evolution has launched its product portfolio with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) on Wednesday. The company is streaming its products directly from its Vancouver studio, and locals can now access Evolution’s Live Casino services at the OLG.ca website, the province’s officially licensed iGaming portal.</p>
<p>Players Now Able to Access Brand New Products</p>
<p>Players can access a number of games, name blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. The supplier has highly-trained live dealers who communicate with players via a video feed streamed in real-time. Evolution is listed as a separate section on the OLG’s site, with the site packing a variety of products, including instant lottery and slot games.</p>
<p>Previously, Evolution launched with several other provincial regulators and gaming authorities in Canada to name the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (AGLC), and Loto-Quebec.</p>
<p>Welcoming the opportunity to be adding more quality products to its offer, OLG chief digital and strategy officer Dave Pridmore welcomed the opportunity to be partnering with Evolution:</p>
<p>“We want to provide the best live dealer experience available, and we are confident that our players will love the quality and the choice of these games, playing at tables with other Canadian players and game presenters.” OLG chief digital and strategy officer Dave Pridmore</p>
<p>Evolution NA commercial director Jeff Millar commented that the partnership is another opportunity for the company to strengthen its position in the country. Millar confirmed that Evolution is actively seeking to create a studio offering that is fully capable of servicing every lottery in Canada.</p>
<p>“We are excited to provide OLG our growing library of live dealer games and sharing the invaluable insight we have gained in serving the other Canadian provinces,” Millar concluded.</p>
<p>Canada’s Potential Continues to Attract Gaming Heavyweights</p>
<p>Canada remains an important market for numerous brands. PointsBet has made a number of restructuring in its newly-established business in the country, with a lot of talent joining over the past two months. Score Media and Gaming became the exclusive Official Gaming Partner of Golf Canada as Canada itself is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion in gambling by 2030.</p>
