<p>Bet365 has boosted its in-play markets by adding the Live Golf Tracker to offer a more accurate and reliable live betting experience.</p>
<p>Golf Tracker Becomes Latest Tracking Tool for Bet365’s In-Play Markets</p>
<p>Bet365 has enhanced its expertise in providing in-play betting solutions for golf markets with a new, dedicated Live Golf Tracker. As a result, sports bettors can better track putt, iron, and drive moves in real-time down to split seconds.</p>
<p>The solution is powered by IMG Arena and it had a pilot launch on October 8, in time for the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, part of the PGA Tour and one of the most significant golfing events, along with the BMW Championship this week.</p>
<p>Bet365 has stated that the new tool allows sports fans to sort through scorecards and tournaments leaderboards, and benefit from in-depth breakdown analysis of shot-by-shot data for each player.</p>
<p>In addition, bet365 will be streaming two par-3 holes every day, supplementing the betting experience with a more traditional feature. Players will enjoy a new, tracking course feature offering sports fans a visual aid in following the progress of each event.</p>
<p>The IMG Arena in-play solution has been developed with ShotLink system, a partner to the PGA Tour. ShotLink has been providing and synthesizing data for the PGA Tour as an official partner.</p>
<p>IMG Arena recently had to upgrade its solution to meet new standards for the accuracy of information fed back to sportsbooks and consumers during live betting contests. ShotLink uses a plethora of tracking tools to ensure the authenticity of the data it trawls from live games.</p>
<p>That includes greenside cameras, walking scorers, and lasers, now strengthened by IMG Arena’s proprietary GPS technology and additional lenses. Bet365 has been actively looking to recruit more employees for the company’s technological department, even though bet365 recruited 100 over the past few months. There are some 118 vacancies still available, pointing to further interest for growth.</p>
<p>Bet365 Continues to Post Strong Results in Key Markets</p>
<p>Bet365 has continued to expand its clout across the world, with a particular focus on new and developing markets. The company continues to dominate in Italy, where it posted €11.5 million in gross gaming revenue (GGR) despite new restrictions introduced by the Italian government, outpacing the competition in the country yet another month.</p>
<p>Bet365 has enhanced its presence in the esports betting space, by striking a new partnership with Win.gg’s Winners.net, a website dedicated to collating and offering comparison service for esports betting markets and odds.</p>
<p>Winners.net has already brought online esports odds by several established brands, including PointsBet and MGM. Bet365 has already established operations in New Jersey where the company’s has been stepping up its efforts by committing marketing resources.</p>
<p>Organic searches for the bet365 brand have also increased according to Google Trends, pointing to a steady business model for the company. Bet365 has been active in the fight against COVID-19 at home, donating $125 million along with GVC Holdings and William Hill in the United Kingdom to help tackle the pandemic.</p>
<p>In August, bet365 and Playtech announced a fresh partnership for the New Jersey market whereby Playtech launched its proprietor casino solution on bet365’s digital skin in the Garden State.</p>
