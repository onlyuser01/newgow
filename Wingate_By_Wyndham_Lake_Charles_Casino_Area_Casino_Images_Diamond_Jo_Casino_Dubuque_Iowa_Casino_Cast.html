<p>Pennsylvania's first AAA Four-Diamond casino resort and popular entertainment destination, Mount Airy Casino Resort, announced it donated bed sets and linens to Camp Papillon, a local non-profit, no-kill animal shelter located in Stroudsburg.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by Mount Airy Casino Resort, the donation will help the abused and neglected animals in the shelter feel more comfortable and warmer. The casino resort confirmed it is donating truckloads of premium Egyptian cotton linen and bed sets to the shelter.</p>
<p>Every year, an estimated 17 million tons of textile waste is disposed of in landfills around the United States. This includes towels, bedding, or other linen that no longer meets the high standards of the hotel industry.</p>
<p>But while some choose to discard such materials, Mount Airy Casino Resort confirmed it plans to donate it to Camp Papillon, as well as other organizations that can use it. According to Ben Koff, Mount Airy's COO and General Manager, the luxury resort needs to frequently replace its comforters and bed linen to ensure "outstanding quality bed linens" for its visitors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, he said: "Giving back to our community has always been important at Mount Airy Casino Resort." He explained that the resort has seen support from its neighbors and that it is happy to support local organizations.</p>
<p>"Finding a way to reuse these quality linens while helping those in need represents Mount Airy's dedication to regional nonprofits and our commitment to serving as responsible stewards of the environment," said Koff in conclusion.</p>
<p>Felicia Katz, Camp Papillon's vice president, was also excited about the latest announcement acknowledging that the donation will bring warmth and comfort to the rescued animals at the shelter, especially during the cold winter months." Mount Airy has provided us with items we cannot afford, soft bedding and towels to dry animals after their baths," she explained.</p>
<p>Katz pointed out the importance of the donation as the soft bedding and linen will help relieve the animals from the stress they experienced considering their confinement in a shelter. Finally, she said that this, in turn, will significantly help with their adoption considering that calm animals are easier to adopt.</p>
<p>Currently, Mount Airy is a popular location that provides plenty of entertainment and casino options. The venue has approximately 1,700 slot machines, as well as 80 table games. Additionally, Mount Airy offers a sportsbook along with a luxury betting lounge, delivering unique experiences for sports fans and bettors.</p>
