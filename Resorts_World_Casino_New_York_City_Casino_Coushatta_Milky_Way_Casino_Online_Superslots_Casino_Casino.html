    <h1>Resorts World Casino New York City Casino Coushatta Milky Way Casino Online Superslots Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Low6, an award-winning company that focuses on sports gamification, has entered into a fresh content partnership with BET99, a Canadian sports wagering, and iGaming company. The partnership will see Low6 roll out its free-to-play Pick’em games tailored to the new NFL season.</p>
<p>Free-to-play Games to Boost BET99 Engagement</p>
<p>Both BET99.com and BET99.net will benefit from this addition and will debut the free-to-play games offered by Low6 to help consumers experience sports in a new and exciting way. Low6 prides itself on delivering great products in this particular vertical and creating opportunities for consumers and businesses. The company uses a full white label platform to ensure that partner brands have a quick and easy time onboarding the games and presenting them to consumers.</p>
<p>Low6 is also benefiting from this partnership by expanding its footprint in the Canadian market, which is beginning to pick up steam. The legalization and subsequent launch of private gambling in Ontario have been a catalyst for other provinces in the country that are similarly exploring the opportunity to revamp their gambling frameworks.</p>
<p>Low6 is also confident that its free-to-play products will also help BET99 with establishing a strong footprint and developing a customer database in the fast-developing iGaming and betting markets in the region. Jamie Mitchell, Low6 co-founder, and Group CEO welcome the opportunity to strike this partnership in the relatively new Canadian market.</p>
<p>Beyond acquiring specific user data, Low6’s gamification suite provides operators with strong behavioral data which can be used to best personalize communications with them.</p>
<p>Mitchell confirmed that Low6 is very excited to be part of BET99’s push into the sports betting space in the country and that the company was prepared to deliver a first-class gaming experience.</p>
<p>BET99 Excited about Gamification Prospects</p>
<p>BQC Consulting GmbH, the company behind BET99, also welcomed the opportunity. Milena Teskova, CEO at BQC, said that the company was delighted to have this opportunity to be teaming up with Low6. “Their expertise in free-to-play games is known industry-wide, and they have a strong understanding of the market and consumer,” she added.</p>
<p>Low6’s gamification tools will no doubt lead to better engagement with consumers, she noted, as the company remains confident about the Canadian market and reaching out to new audiences.</p>
