    <h1>Mohegan Sun Casino Pocono Live Philadelphia Casino Robert De Niro Casino Hotel Casino Wendover Nevad</h1>

<p>Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment, a master developer and operator of global integrated entertainment resorts, has announced the launch of Mohegan Digital, a new division that will delegate the company’s online gaming operation.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming launches a new digital division</p>
<p>On Monday, Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment launched its Mohegan Digital division, which will oversee its online gaming operations, including its sportsbook, Mohegan Sun, and its online wagering and gaming solutions. All of its digital operations have been legalized and signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in May. Rich Roberts is the new president, and Aviram Alroy, vice president of the new division.</p>
<p>MGE’s president and CEO, Ray Pineault, stated, “Over the years, Mohegan has made great technological advancements in the digital space, working with industry-leading partners to provide state-of-the-art advancements to casino and sportsbook online operations. With Mohegan Digital, we are looking to expand and enhance these efforts.”</p>
<p>He also stated that the company is consistent in its digital gaming growth, especially in 2020, during the expansion of sports betting in the US. He added that Mohegan Digital launches at the right time, given the increased interest in gambling in the country.</p>
<p>Mohegan Digital absorbs MGE interactive gaming division</p>
<p>Before working at MGE, Roberts was the executive business consultant of RSD Consulting, a company dedicated to helping organizations enter the US sports digital media and markets. He was also the CEO of FaceOff, a peer-to-peer skill sports gaming platform.</p>
<p>Alroy has been with the company since 2014, and has served as a vice president of interactive gaming for MGE, which will be a part of the Mohegan Digital division. He stated that it is exciting to be working in the iGaming industry in times like these as more states, including Connecticut, launch sports betting and iGaming in the US.</p>
<p>Alroy added that, while working as a vice president of the interactive gaming division of MGE, he learned many useful skills to “help usher in a new era for the brand now.” Alroy expects the company plans to enter the markets of Washington, Pennsylvania, and other states in the US, as well as Ontario, Canada, in the future.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming postponed its Inspire project to 2023</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming delayed its Inspire Entertainment Resort project at Incheon, South Korea, due to the pandemic in 2020. The company postponed the project to early 2023. Its first phase, valued at $1 billion, was supposed to be completed by 2022.</p>
<p>The first phase included building a five-star hotel with more than 1,250 luxurious rooms, a big sports arena for concerts and sporting events, and a 20,000-square-meter (just under five acres) casino with 150 gaming tables and 700 slot machines. The whole project amounts to around $5 billion. It is located about an hour away from the heart of Seoul, at Incheon International Airport. MGE informed the public about its postponement with its Q42020 report, released on December 22 of last year.</p>
