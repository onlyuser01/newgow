    <h1>Comanche Casino Blue Chip Casino Photos Instant Payout Casino Casinos In Washington Dc Royal Casino</h1>

<p>Account was verified. Deposited no problem. Withdrawal didn't get processed. After 28 days suddenly ask for source of wealth documents. All provided several times over. I said this situation was stressing me out and they self excluded me without me agreeing. I finally did agree purely for the reason as they were now breaking the UK law and UK gambling commission rules by not paying me any monies owed immediately.</p>
<p>I am now on day 90 and still no money. Had an email 8 days ago saying my withdrawal had finally been approved and would be paid in 3 to 5 working days. Now 6th working day and still nothing.</p>
