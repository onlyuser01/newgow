<p>The operator of land-based casinos, resorts and online gaming Bally’s Corporation announced today a multi-faceted marketing partnership with the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>In-Stadium Brand Visibility</p>
<p>The agreement between Bally’s and the 27-time World Series Champions marks the operator’s first sports betting partnership in New York following its launch of online sports betting operations in the state in July, and designates Bally Bet as an Official Sports Betting Partner of the Yankees.</p>
<p>Bally’s Interactive chief operating officer for North America Adi Dhandhania hailed the partnership that would boost Bally Bet’s and other Bally’s brands’ visibility in the state, pointing to the history of the Yankees as a franchise and its popularity as a global brand that “speaks for itself.”</p>
<p>The multi-faceted marketing partnership designated not only Bally Bet as the team’s Official Sports Betting Partner but Monkey Knife Fight as an official fantasy sports partner, Bally Casino as an official iGaming partner, and Bally Play an official free-to-play gaming partner and granted Bally’s brands access to trademarks and marketing designations of the Yankees. Bally’s casino in Atlantic City became a proud partner of the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>New York Yankees’ senior vice president of Partnerships Michael Tusiani spoke with excitement about the new partnership with Bally’s, outlining that the new brand visibility across Yankee Stadium and Bally’s in-stadium customer engagement will help the company strengthen its “overall gaming presence in New York.”</p>
<p>Inside Yankees Stadium, Bally’s brands will receive visibility via LED advertising placed at multiple locations, including the outfield wall that lines the playing field, walls on the Main Level bars in left and right field facing the field, the Terrace Level ribbon board, as well as boards throughout the Great Hall.</p>
<p>During games, Bally’s logo will feature via the high-definition centerfield video board at the stadium and the brand will get other activations to help boost its awareness among the fans of the Yankees.</p>
<p>Expanding Presence in Sports</p>
<p>The partnership deal with the Yankees further strengthened Bally’s growing footprint across media and sports nationwide as the brand has been already designated as an Authorized Gaming Operator of three of the major leagues – MLB, NHL, and NBA – as well as the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA).</p>
<p>The agreement with the Yankees sides with previous partnerships Bally’s has established with the Nashville Predators of the NHL, WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury and Cleveland Browns of the NFL.</p>
<p>Recently, Bally’s has acquired market access in Kansas as one of the partners of Boot Hill Casino &amp; Resort in Dodge City and will be in line to accept mobile bets as soon as the state launches mobile sports betting officially.</p>
