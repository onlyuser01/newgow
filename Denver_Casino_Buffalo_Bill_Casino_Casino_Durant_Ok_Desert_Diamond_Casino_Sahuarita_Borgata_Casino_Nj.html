    <h1>Denver Casino Buffalo Bill Casino Casino Durant Ok Desert Diamond Casino Sahuarita Borgata Casino Nj</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>Please be assured that I have considered my complaints and not formulate and submit them meaninglessly. I briefly raised my issue on the WillsCasino discussion forum yesterday and Radka and Simon felt it was worth complaining about. So I'm filing this complaint, knowing my chances are extremely slim. But if I can get the casino to reconsider and change the player protection features, I'll be happy.</p>
<p>Casinos offer (must offer) various player protection features that aim to protect players from further loss of money. This is how protection is defined. There is the possibility of time out (freeze account / cool-off period) and the possibility of self-exclusion. This raises the question of what exactly is the difference between a «cool-off period» and self-exclusion. While you no longer have access to the account for a certain period of time with self-exclusion (exclusion), the account is frozen with the cool-off period. Frozen means that you can no longer make deposits and play. The purpose of the cool-off period is that you can no longer gamble away your winnings, but you can still access the account and make withdrawals. Otherwise, the distinction between cool-off period and self-exclusion is not necessary at all.</p>
<p>Since I tend to be addicted to gambling, I always look for casinos that offer a cool-off period (freeze account). So I can freeze the account after a win and have the win paid out step by step depending on the payout limit. Because WillsCasino offers a freez function, I registered and played there. When I was 2000 euros up I asked the chat if I can withdraw funds during a freeze period. Support said no. He also said that I have to get verified first, then withdraw the money and only then can I freeze my account. According to the casino, verification takes up to 48 hours. That means I could not have benefited from the player protection functions for 48 hours. As it is, I lost the 2000 because I couldn't freeze my account and deposited and lost another 1300 euros. This would not have happened if I could have withdrawn during a cool-off period.</p>
<p>I truly believe that during a cool-off period, players should be able to access the account, withdraw, upload documents for verification, but not be able to play or deposit. This is what 99% of casinos understand by the cool-off period. If I had withdrawn the money and uploaded the verification documents and if there was something wrong with that, I would have had to wait until the cool-off period was over and then start a withdrawal etc. This goes against the spirit of player protection, if his money is not protected from loss.</p>
<p>What does Casino Guru think about this? Should players be able to withdraw during a cool-off period?</p>
<p>I am asking the casino to reconsider the cool-off period and change it to allow future players to withdraw while the account is frozen. Cool-off period (freeze account) it's not the same as a self-exclusion, even if that's how you handle it. Furthermore, I claim my losses back in the amount of 3300 euros. I am also willing to make a deal if the casino is self-critical.</p>
<p>If Casino Guru would like documents (live chat conversations), please let me know.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
