<p>Sweeney is an experienced veteran with years of experience in the non-profit sector</p>
<p>The UK’s DCMS announced that the Secretary of State Lucy Frazer has appointed Paul Sweeney as the interim chairman of The National Lottery Community Fund. The announcement described Sweeney as a seasoned individual with years of experience in the voluntary, community and public sectors in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The announcement added that Sweeney will serve in the role for 12 months starting August 1, 2023, or until a permanent substitute has been appointed. In his position, he will be remunerated at £40,000 a year (around $51,000).</p>
<p>The interim appointment, the announcement added, was made as an exceptional appointment without completion. The DCMS also added that Sweeney has not been involved in any political activity in the last five years.</p>
<p>Sweeney Has a Wealth of Experience in the Non-Profit Sector</p>
<p>Between 1987 and 1994, Sweeney served as the director of the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, a local community-oriented charity supporting self-help initiatives.</p>
<p>In 1994, the appointee joined the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS). At first, he served as an adviser on community development and reconciliation. Eventually, Sweeney was promoted to a number of senior positions, including deputy secretary in the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister, permanent secretary in the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure and permanent secretary in the Department of Education</p>
<p>In 2017, Sweeney departed from the NICS to pursue other opportunities. Since then, he has had short stints with several charity organizations, primarily focused on regeneration, culture and young people.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2021, Sweeney was named chair of The National Lottery Community Fund’s Northern Ireland Funding Committee.</p>
<p>Allwyn to Take Over the National Lottery in 2024</p>
<p>Sweeney’s appointment comes ahead of Allwyn’s takeover of the United Kingdom’s National Lottery. Last year, the UKGC appointed Allwyn as the next National Lottery operator – a fact that the incumbent operator, Camelot, was initially unamused with.</p>
<p>As a result, Camelot tried to block the licensing process, claiming that the UKGC had favored its competitor. The conflict lasted several months but in the end, Camelot conceded, allowing the commission to crown Allwyn as the next National Lottery operator. Allwyn is set to take over the National Lottery in February 2024.</p>
<p>Shortly after the conflict ended, Allwyn expressed its intention to acquire Camelot, which it did a few months later.</p>
<p>In May, the UK National Lottery recorded stable growth, attesting to its popularity. In the meantime, Allwyn picked Leo Burnett and VCCP as joint creative advertising agencies.</p>
