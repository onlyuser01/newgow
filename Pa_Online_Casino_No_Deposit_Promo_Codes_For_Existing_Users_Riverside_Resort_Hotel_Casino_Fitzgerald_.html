    <h1>Pa Online Casino No Deposit Promo Codes For Existing Users Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Fitzgerald</h1>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam, I registered with you on November 26th, 2021 and paid 3000 euros into the betting account in 1000 steps. I only use it for sports betting. The first two bets were lost. Everything on one card. That was a lot of luck, my account balance was 9906 euros. after 3 weeks my account balance was 12900. I wanted to withdraw some of the money but had to verify myself first. first stage 1 then stage 2 of verification. had all submitted. still no payment. Support said I had to bet the entire amount at 1.5 odds. even though I didn't have a requested bonus. again no payment. on December 15th, 2021 I deducted 4906 euros from my betting account. allegedly because you can only win 5000 euros per bet. in your betting regulations (1.4 The maximum winnings per betting slip is ............... .. (...... .EUR). The support could not give me a clear answer. That is not serious and must be clearly marked in the betting regulations. According to his statement, that would be "different". You cannot simply set an upper limit for the bettor after 3 weeks and withdraw money from the account. You are therefore not allowed to declare the bet invalid afterwards.( only in the case of betting manipulation. which is clearly not the case here). The bet was checked for a few minutes when it was submitted and approved. I then had my account blocked immediately and informed customer service that it was not possible. They were anything but friendly. I had the feeling that I was constantly being confronted with excuses or that I was kicked out of the chat.</p>
<p>But that's not enough. After about 3 weeks my account was completely verified and the first 1000 euros were transferred.</p>
<p>1 week later again 1000 euros. The 3rd payout was canceled again or booked back to my betting account.</p>
<p>Written to customer service by email. No answer. Support written to via chat. This now claims that I have a vpn (virtual private</p>
<p>network) use.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. I had to answer a few questions in which I affirmed that I would not use a vpn. Only antivirus software is installed on my computer, which every computer has these days. As a result, all my money was deleted from my betting account.</p>
<p>I am sure that there are more people who have had similar experiences with campeonbet. The game is played for a limited time (many gamble away their money during verification) and all means are used to prevent the payment of winnings. campeonbet owes me 10,900 euros .</p>
<p>what I think about it I will not write here publicly.</p>
<p>I've been in the sports betting business for 20 years, but I've never experienced anything so "negative" before.</p>
<p>and i want to say to other players that be careful here!</p>
<p>Kind regards SM****</p>
