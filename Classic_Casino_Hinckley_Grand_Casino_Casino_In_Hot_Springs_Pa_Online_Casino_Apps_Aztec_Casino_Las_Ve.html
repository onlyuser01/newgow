<p>Caesars Entertainment ranks 104 in “America’s Most Responsible Companies” list and has been recognized for its commitment to equality and the environment.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment Ranks 104 in US for Corporate Responsibility</p>
<p>Newsweek has recognized Caesars Entertainment, the largest gaming and entertainment company in the US, for its efforts to improve and promote corporate social responsibility. The company has jumped 42 spots to rank 104 in Newsweek’s list of “America’s Most Responsible Companies” for 2020.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment now holds the highest spot out of all Entertainment, Leisure and Dining companies across the US – an impressive step up from previous years. More importantly, the entertainment giant ranks in the top 5% out of all companies listed in the survey. Newsweek’s “Most Responsible Companies” list examines over 2,000 of the highest revenue-generating businesses in the US.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg has attributed the company’s success to the steadfast work, compassion, and generosity of its dedicated team members. He lauded their commitment to not just the company’s guests, partners, and environment, but to each other and to the communities in which they live and work.</p>
<p>Caesars Recognized for Commitment to Equality and Environment</p>
<p>Caesars has also received two important recognitions from the international environmental non-profit CDP Worldwide. The company has been recognized for its leadership in corporate sustainability, earning two spots on CDP’s coveted “A-List”. CDP has acknowledged Caesars’ commitment to significantly reducing its carbon footprint and its water consumption throughout the US. This makes Caesars one of the precious few companies to earn such a distinction.</p>
<p>But that’s not all – the entertainment giant has also received a perfect 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for the 14th year in a row! The foundation’s Corporate Equality Index is a tool to benchmark corporate policies and practices in regard to LGBTQ+ employees.</p>
<p>This covers a wide range of criteria, such as workplace protection, benefits, inclusivity, world place culture and responsible corporate citizenship. In recognition of Caesars’ commitment to workplace equality, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has named it the “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality”.</p>
<p>And finally, Caesars has earned one more important distinction – the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation (USPAACC) has selected the company as one of its “Top 35 Corporation Stars”. The USPAACC is the most effective and well-known nonprofit business organization that represents Asian-American citizens – the fastest-growing group in the US.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment is looking forward to expanding the scope and depth of its commitment to economic development and equality, as well as its commitment to improving the lives of its Team Members and society at large.</p>
