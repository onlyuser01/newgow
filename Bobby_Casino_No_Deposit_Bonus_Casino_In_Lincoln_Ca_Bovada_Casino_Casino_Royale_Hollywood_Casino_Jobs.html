    <h1>Bobby Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino In Lincoln Ca Bovada Casino Casino Royale Hollywood Casino Jobs</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), a provider of cloud-based products and platform services and performance marketing to the iGaming industry, has penned a Head of Terms agreement with a major casino company in Europe. Although the company did not disclose the name of its new partner, it noted that it is a “well-known” local land-based operator.</p>
<p>GiG to Supply another European Company with Its Solutions</p>
<p>As announced by GiG, the Head of Terms agreement outlines the provision of its award-winning player account management (PAM) platform and its front-end delivery and content management system (CSM) to the undisclosed partner. This will help the operator in question make a foray into the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>GiG noted that its new partner has more than 25 years of experience in the live casino industry. The provider noted that the company in question is very interested in taking the rest of its content online, capitalizing on the quick growth of the European iGaming sector. Once it goes online, GiG mentioned, the major European company wants to tackle both established jurisdictions and emerging markets.</p>
<p>GiG said that the current agreement should be made formal within the next few weeks. According to the provider, the deal will be signed for an initial period of five years. If everything goes according to plan, it should go live in the second half of the current year.</p>
<p>GiG Is Excited to Help More Companies Enter the iGaming Sector</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Brown, commented on the newly-penned Head of Terms agreement. He noted that the company will once again have the opportunity to help a land-based operator go online. Brown pointed out that his team is already experienced in executing such projects and will happily assist the established European operator tap into what the iGaming sector has to offer.</p>
<p>Having executed many of these projects across both emerging and regulated markets, we are happy to partner with another company that carries strong retail experience, and to drive value into the diversification of their organization. Richard Brown, CEO, GiG</p>
<p>This agreement further cements GiG as a leading provider of solutions for operators wishing to establish a global presence through the Internet. The provider currently serves 29 regulated jurisdictions and is preparing to launch in another 8.</p>
<p>The current agreement mirrors a similar deal GiG signed at the beginning of this month when it announced its first Switzerland-oriented agreement. The provider agreed to power the Swiss brand with its PAM solutions and said that the deal should be made official by Q3 of 2023.</p>
