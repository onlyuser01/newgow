    <h1>Casino Hotel In Las Vegas Casinos Near Temecula San Juan Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Reviews Ho</h1>

<p>Dear Gigo1122,</p>
<p>I found this information on the casino's website - Banking section (available HERE):</p>
<p>"REQUESTING A PAYOUT:</p>
<p>Simply go to Desert Nights Casino and visit the 'Cashier' and select 'Withdraw', here you will find your available withdrawal method along with further instructions."</p>
<p>And this is the rule stated in its General Terms and Conditions that you accepted upon registration (possible to find HERE):</p>
<p>"Payouts will always be sent to the payment method used to deposit, if possible. Desert Night reserves the right to make the final decision through which method you may receive your withdrawal(s). Payouts are only processed to accounts controlled and owned by you, the account holder."</p>
<p>The above information is publicly and freely available and it was necessary to check it before depositing to the casino. The situation was already explained in my previous post. Although the casino offers limited payment methods options, it is willing to pay you the funds out and tries to find an alternative option. The information about possible withdrawal methods is clearly explained on the casino's official website and available at the cashier. If anything is not clear, a player can also ask the casino's Customer Support. Regarding the payment methods conditions, in the meantime, something was obviously changed.</p>
<p>I have to repeat a part of my previous post.</p>
<p>"If you have been advised by the casino to use an alternative payment method to withdraw your winnings, I would strongly recommend following their instructions. However, it also should meet some criteria.</p>
<p>Is there any problem with providing the casino with your personal bank account details?"</p>
<p>So, are you please able to provide the casino with the required data and willing to further cooperate in resolving your issue?</p>
<p>Your cooperation is required, and as it was stated - otherwise, I am afraid there is nothing more to be resolved on our side.</p>
