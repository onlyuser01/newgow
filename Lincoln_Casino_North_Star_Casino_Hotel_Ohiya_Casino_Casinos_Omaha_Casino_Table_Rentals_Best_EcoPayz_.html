<p>Information about EcoPayz (Payz) casinos</p>
<p>EcoPayz, also known as just Payz since May 2023, is an online payment service that offers customers the chance to make secure instant payments to businesses and individuals around the world. If you use the ecoPayz payment method, then you'll be able to deposit and withdraw money in the many ecoPayz online casinos in this list that support it.</p>
<p>All ecoPayz casinos in this list have been reviewed and rated by the Casino Guru team. Hopefully, this will give you the peace of mind to find a safe casino to use, and in this article, we're going to talk a bit more about ecoPayz and its features.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>EcoPayz - A global provider with a wide range of services</p>
<p>The company behind ecoPayz, PSI-Pay Ltd, was authorised as an electronic money issuer in 2008 by the FSA in the United Kingdom. Their popularity grew and the next few years saw them become Mastercard members, as well launching the first-ever app from a financial institution, through ecoPayz's former guise EcoCard.</p>
<p>The app was a success and this led the company to expand their range of services. With them now offering much more than an ecoCard, a rebrand was completed in 2013, resulting in the ecoPayz we know today.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has become a global presence, offering 24/7 multilingual support to their customers in countries as diverse as India and Belgium. This outreach has been greatly enhanced through a partnership with Western Union, making them the only UK-based e-wallet in the Union's network.</p>
<p>Apart from the popular ecoAccount, customers also have access to financial options such as the prepaid ecoCard, the ecoVirtualcard - a digital card that works in tandem with the ecoAccount - and ecoVouchers, which allow you to pay online without using a credit card. Customers also have the opportunity to take part in an affiliate program that offers them rewards based on the referrals they make.</p>
<p>In May 2023, ecoPayz has been rebranded to Payz. Although many users still refer to the company and its services as "ecoPayz", the official name used by the company itself is now three letters shorter.</p>
<p>The Pros and Cons of ecoPayz</p>
<p>Like with any other prepaid card, ecoPayz gives you the chance to pay and receive money online without entering any credit card data or personal details. What's more, their vouchers offer another alternative - just pay for one in cash at a retailer and you're ready to go.</p>
<p>Setting up an account is extremely easy and also offers a great level of security as your details will be safe from fraudulent use.</p>
<p>Once you have this set up, you can then send money instantly, and in multiple currencies, with ecoPayz offering low rates to do this for you. It also means you can make ecoPayz deposits into online casinos that support this method in no time at all, allowing you to play right away.</p>
<p>A possible negative for users are the mixed reviews that the company has received on review sites. Trustpilot has them at an 'average' rating of 3.5 out of 5, with complaints ranging from poor customer service to failed card detection. However it's worth remembering that maybe there was a misunderstanding on the customer's part, and there are plenty of five-star reviews praising ecoPayz's excellent service.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that other payment forms are much more common than ecoPayz. Sites that accept Skrill, Neteller, or just plain old debit or credit cards, are much more widespread, for example, so it's possible that some casinos will be out of your reach if your only payment method is ecoPayz.</p>
<p>Using ecoPayz in online casinos</p>
<p>If you already have an ecoPayz account set up, the first step is to create a player account at an ecoPayz-supported casino. This is where our list comes in handy, as each and every casino on this page will allow you to do just that.</p>
<p>Our review team has got to work and supplied a rating for each ecoPayz casino, so, once you have found one that is reliable, you can then sign up and easily deposit money into your casino account.</p>
<p>Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>Log in to your casino account. Open the cashier and select the ecoPayz payment option. Type in the amount you wish to deposit and enter your ecoPayz card details, or the 10-digit code on your eVoucher (if you have one of those). If this has been done correctly, the amount should appear in your balance and you're free to start spending.</p>
<p>How to choose an ecoPayz casino</p>
<p>We want you to fully enjoy your casino experience so it's important to find the best casinos for you to play on. Our How to choose a casino article is a great place to start, with tips and advice to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Our list of ecoPayz casinos will help you find the most reliable options that have undergone our rigorous review system.</p>
<p>If you're in a rush, then the quickest way to choose an ecoPayz online casino is to click on the 'Recommended' tab near the top of this page. This will give you the very best options that our review team have found so far.</p>
<p>You can also apply more filters to make your list more specific. The 'For players from' filter allows you to sort the casinos by country, so you just see ecoPayz casinos for players from Canada or Australia, for example.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 'Newly opened' tab will give you access to the most recent offerings, while hitting the 'All' tab will take you back to the full selection of ecoPayz-friendly casinos that we have.</p>
<p>EcoPayz casino bonuses</p>
<p>One last thing: maybe you want to see those ecoPayz casinos that provide the opportunity to utilize bonuses.</p>
<p>To do this, visit our list of casino bonuses and tick ecoPayz on the payment provider filter. You'll then see all bonuses offered by casinos that accept ecoPayz payments. This can be narrowed down to a certain type of bonus, so by clicking the 'no deposit bonus' filter as well, you'll get just those. Alternatively, visit the list of no deposit bonuses and select the ecoPayz filter from there.</p>
