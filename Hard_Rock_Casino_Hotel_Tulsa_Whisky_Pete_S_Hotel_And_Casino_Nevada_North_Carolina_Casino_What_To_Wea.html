    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Hotel Tulsa Whisky Pete S Hotel And Casino Nevada North Carolina Casino What To Wea</h1>

<p>Here is the email I sent to the Jackpotvillage casino support. The text is aimed at the casino but also explains my complaint,</p>
<p>I can say that I am an experienced player and have deposited in many casinos and have successfully applied for withdrawals. Therefore I know how important it is to deal with the bonus rules before making a deposit.</p>
<p>Therefore, before I make the first deposit in a casino, I always ask in live chat whether I am qualified for the welcome bonus or not.</p>
<p>Then I use the search function (Ctrl + F) and check whether there is an exclusion of the payment method in the general bonus conditions. I did that at "Jackpotvillage" before I deposited (https://www.Jackpotvillage.com/de-de/promoterms) but couldn't find the word Skrill. Thereupon I made a deposit but only because the website itself actively chooses a bonus in the deposit process. On the deposit page, I first selected Skrill and set the deposit amount and clicked on.</p>
<p>After the website had reloaded, another field appeared asking if I would like to select a bonus. When I clicked on add bonus there came a kind of egg timer after further reloading, which implies that a bonus is being sought. Since I did not find any exclusion from Skrill in the bonus rules (https://www.jackpotvillage.com/de-de/promoterms) and the welcome bonus was explicitly selected after I had chosen Skrillal's deposit method, I assumed that the casino gave me does not offer a bonus that I cannot get because I am violating the rules of the casino. Unfortunately, I fell into the Skrill trap with it.</p>
<p>The bonus was credited to me by the casino and I started playing. Without ever touching the bonus, I won so after a while I thought it would be time to request a withdrawal. Unfortunately that didn't work and that's why I asked in live chat to cancel the bonus. In the chat I was told that I first had to meet the sales conditions. That's what I did then. I then requested a payment of â‚¬ 500 and immediately uploaded my documents so that I could be verified. Nothing happened for 2 days until I received the email that I am now verified. Then a day later came the news that my winnings had been confiscated:</p>
<p>our account has been found to be in breach of clause 7 - of our Promotional&gt; Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>This paragraph 7 can only be found on the promotional page of the casino in the small print and not in the Terms and Conditions or the Bonus Rules website.</p>
<p>There you will only find an indication that there are further rules on the promotion page. Of course, I did not read the entire terms and conditions and bonus rules, but trusted that the bonus rules can be found on the corresponding pages. With the search function Ctrl + F I search to get a quick certainty whether Skrill is excluded from the bonus offer since this is quite often the case.</p>
<p>How can it be that a casino is allowed to give a bonus that the casino does not want to give me and that I cannot take because otherwise my winnings will be retained.</p>
<p>At any other casino I know that would not have been possible but the deposit would have been accepted but the bonus was not well credited to me.</p>
<p>To summarize again:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I couldn't find anything about Skrill on your Terms and Conditions page and your Bonus Rules website. I could not know that you spread your rules all over the website. I always inform myself about the rules and always contact the live chat first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I claimed the bonus with a clear conscience because the bonus during the deposit process after I had selected the amount and the payment method on an extra newly loaded website, so after I had the impression that a system query was checking possible bonuses. The forbidden bonus was explicitly offered to you after the system query took place. Your system gives the impression that everything is done correctly and supports the player in making an avoidable mistake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never informed about the deposit error until one day after the verification process was ended. Perhaps the casino would rather wait here for a payout at all. If not, then at least there is no need to confront the customer with the confiscation of his profit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't get by with the space. Will attach a second complaint. Please excuse that.</p>
