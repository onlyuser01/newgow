    <h1>Hotel Near Mohegan Sun Casino Casino In Gambling Casino Near Me Casinos In New Mexico Prime Rib Live</h1>

<p>So I've been playing on this casino for quite some time.</p>
<p>I had my account up to 600 but stopped and requested to withdraw 300.</p>
<p>I selected bitcoin because it says it's instant(it's not wait for them to approve)</p>
<p>I'm waiting and waiting, then I ask in chat what's up.</p>
<p>Suddenly my account has 350 playable, then suddenly .21 cents</p>
<p>They cancelled my withdrawal and sent me an email saying I was a bonus abuser. I've spent thousands at this casino, and have not abused bonuses. They took my 350 dollars, and said</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well.Kindly note that your withdrawal was declined and the winnings voided since your account is in breach of our Terms and Conditions item 2.5.7. Bonuses offered by our casino are intended for genuine recreational players only. Abuse of any bonus offer will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if bonus abuse is suspected.

<p>This is total bs. they offer the bonus, but I've never had the ratio they say. Plus, why even offer a bonus if you are going to let people go into violation. Thirdly... I paid by credit card and everytime I did they charged me more then I was buying...</p>
<p>I think I might have to dispute the charges with my CC</p>
<p>Help! and thanks</p>
