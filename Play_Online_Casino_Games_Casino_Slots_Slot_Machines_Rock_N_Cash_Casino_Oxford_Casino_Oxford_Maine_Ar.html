<p>Enteractive, an industry leader in player retention solutions, has expanded its US reach by launching in Pennsylvania. This marks the third state where the company can offer its products.</p>
<p>PGCB Licensed Enteractive</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board has officially cleared Enteractive for launch in the state. Thanks to this, the player retention specialist will expand its reach in the US where it already holds a New Jersey license. As a result, the company’s solutions will now be available in three jurisdictions, namely New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>According to Enteractive, the new license will provide the company with the opportunity to engage with gamblers in the Keystone State. The latter boasts 9.5 million adults many of whom play with local sports betting operators. Enteractive will leverage its (Re)Activation Cloud to help gambling companies target their demographics of choice. Thanks to this, companies can actively promote their products to registered users who are yet to make a deposit, as well as to players of various activity levels.</p>
<p>Enteractive’s API tech allows operators to deploy database segments to Enteractive’s teams which can then quickly engage with players. Through one-to-one conversations, Enteractive’s teams can turn customers into loyal customers while protecting them from harm.</p>
<p>Enteractive Is Excited to Enter the Keystone State</p>
<p>Andrew Foster, Enteractive’s CBO, spoke about the launch. He noted that the company’s endeavors in the United States have been successful so far. Foster said that the positive way players are responding to Enteractive’s one-to-one approach inspired the company to do more and expand its US footprint. Because of this, Foster and his team are happy to announce that the company will expand its reach into Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It’s encouraging to see that the US audience is as appreciative of a personal, qualitative approach as the other global audiences we engage with on behalf of operator brands. Andrew Foster, CBO, Enteractive</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mikael Hansson, chief executive of Enteractive, said that the foray into Pennsylvania complements the company’s New Jersey license. As a result, Enteractive will now be able to support player retention for sportsbooks in the two largest online gambling states in the entire USA.</p>
<p>With some leading U.S. brands already working with our stateside teams, our journey across the pond gets more exciting each day. Mikael Hansson, CEO, Enteractive</p>
<p>Enteractive is а company with almost 15 years of experience in the gaming market and has cemented itself as one of the top revenue generators for the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>In other news, Enteractive just named Faye Williams as its new head of account management.</p>
