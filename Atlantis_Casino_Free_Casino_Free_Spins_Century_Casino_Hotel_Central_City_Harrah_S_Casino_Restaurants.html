<p>Aspire Global is ready to make an entry into the Netherlands. The sportsbook and iGaming operator has been certified by the Dutch Gaming Authority for its online gaming management platform and sportsbook, as well as its casino games.</p>
<p>Online betting is legal in the Netherlands under the KOA Act, and has been since October 2021. Holland Casino was one of the operators that received a license upon its launch. Aspire Global and Holland Casino signed a deal to supply content through Pariplay, a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>
<p>Aspire Global had already announced its first striking platform-management deal in the Dutch market on January 25. Aspire Global will provide BoyleSports' tier 1 operator with a turnkey platform solution, including managed services, for its planned entry into the Netherlands. BoyleSports has more than 350 retail outlets in Ireland and Britain and is the leading UK and Irish online operator. Karamba, a well-known iGaming operator, signed a deal with Aspire Global to access the entire Aspire Global offering when it entered the Dutch market, as well.</p>
<p>This latest certification gives PAM, Aspire Global's online platform, and its BtoBet sportsbook the legal authority to operate in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Aspire Global CEO Tsachi Maimon commented that the newly regulated Dutch market was growing rapidly and is one of Europe's most attractive iGaming markets. He anticipates the iGaming market to expand in the Netherlands and eventually become the largest in Europe.</p>
<p>Maimon added, "Now, when our complete B2B offering is certified, we are ready to play a major role in shaping the Dutch market and to enhance the player experience."</p>
<p>The Dutch Gambling Authority predicts that the country's iGaming industry will grow to â‚¬1.5 billion ($1.68 billion) by 2025.</p>
<p>Aspire Global is able to operate in any gaming vertical, not just casino and sports betting. Earlier this month, it announced that it had signed an agreement to offer its complete turnkey platform solution, which includes managed services, to esports betting company WIN Group. This agreement covers the migration of WIN Group's existing esports site onto Aspire Global's Core Platform.</p>
