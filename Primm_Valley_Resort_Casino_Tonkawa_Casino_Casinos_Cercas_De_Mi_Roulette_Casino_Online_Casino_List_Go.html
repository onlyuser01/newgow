<p>The highlight of the bonusing system is the Golden Rewards Club which is a great way to make your experience special when you play at the Nugget Online Casino. You enroll automatically and earn points by simply playing your favorite games.</p>
<p>Many VIP and loyalty programs expect a gambler to play constantly to maintain their status or advance it, but with the Nugget, you don’t have to chase any point requirement. Once you unlock a level, it’s there and stays there. Once a VIP, always a VIP, as the Golden Nugget puts it.</p>
<p>Another net benefit of joining the loyalty program is that there is no limit on how many points you can earn and then trade for cash. You will earn points based on the following formula:</p>

<p>VIP Elite</p>
<p>Each comes with its own set of unique and tailored perks. You will get leaderboard giveaways and daily, weekly, and monthly bonus offers, enjoy expedited withdrawals and enhanced promotional offers. It all comes down to what level you are at, but the good news is that you don’t have to worry about your points and level deteriorating over time.</p>
<p>Casino Games</p>
<p>The games are the very heart of any casino, and Golden Nugget is no exception. The website brings you an outstanding selection of over 866 worthwhile games that will make every step of the way a real adventure. One of the clear benefits of playing at the Golden Nugget is that you experience games by 24 unique studios.</p>
<p>In the past, iGaming in New Jersey and Michigan was only restricted to a handful of companies, but years in operation have allowed the casino to introduce many new additions. As a result, you will play games by NetEnt, Wild Streak, IGT, Big Time Gaming, Lightning Box, and many other worthwhile options. The number of available games is constantly increasing, and you have an excellent pool of titles to choose from, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Megaways</p>
<p>Live Dealer</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>Roulette</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Exclusive</p>
<p>Steppers</p>
<p>Cluster Pays</p>
<p>Scratchers</p>
<p>Bingo</p>
<p>Jackpots</p>
<p>Virtual Sports</p>
<p>The portfolio of games you can choose from is quite extensive. Numerous features will allow you to optimize your gaming experience and enjoy the sessions. The casino does for you to use as many intuitive filters as possible so that you always focus on the type of products you want to play.</p>
<p>In terms of locating the right titles for you, whether this is something to do with the version, theme, or actual gameplay, you can rest assured that Golden Nugget makes the experience very easy. What you need to do is use one or any number of filters.</p>
<p>You can simply go for Studio, Type, Theme, or sort by Recommended, Rating, Max Payout, and others. The portfolio has several views. This means you can get thumbnail previews of most games, or you can simply hover over, check the game’s rating generated by community members and see if you want to play for real money or try the demo version first.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are the most fun part for some players. There are presently 807 slots at the casino, and this means that you will surely find a title that makes sense for you. You can quickly narrow down the search and choose a slot by features such as Cluster Pays, Megaways, or a Progressive Jackpot.</p>
<p>The games we enjoy here have a proven track record as player-favorites and will surely help you discover new gaming scenarios. Classics such as Extra Chilli Megaways, Divine Fortune Megaways, Bonanza Megaways, and Divine Fortune Megaways are some of the best titles.</p>
<p>If you are not so much into the Megaways slot mechanic, though, you can easily filter by Slots and see some of the recommended titles. You can once again have a closer look at how many stars a single game has, whether it’s something you enjoy as a theme and more.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>The table game selection often overlaps with other aspects of the experience, which means that you will have all sorts of under-categories to enjoy here. The Golden Nugget Casino has done a great job of providing online players with everything they need. There are numerous blackjack tables for a start, including:</p>
<p>High Limit</p>
<p>Live Unlimited</p>
<p>Blackjack Pro MH</p>
<p>MH Blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack SH</p>
<p>The table games selection stretches even further, with numerous versions of roulette waiting for you. Players at Golden Nugget will discover many awesome titles, including European, American, and French.</p>
<p>This will give you plenty of flexibility and allow you to put a good strategy to the test. Besides that, there are more cool options. We enjoyed Super Fun 21 Extreme, Four Card Poker, Casino War, Mississippi Stud, Ultimate Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is another heavily featured option at the Golden Nugget. Players will discover over ten dedicated versions of the game and enjoy them in full. Some of the popular versions here include Destiny Poker, Double Regal Poker, Jacks or Better, Faster Poker, Deuces Wild, and more.</p>
<p>Video poker is the type of game that provides a lot of room for putting your skill to the fore, and that is why many gamblers enjoy it. Well, video poker works just fine with the Golden Nugget loyalty program, so why not stack up some benefits anyway?</p>
<p>Live Casino</p>
<p>The live dealer casino is truly one of a kind, and you will be able to enjoy yourself quite a bit if you choose to give it a shot. Now, the games are also versatile, and you will be able to have a sort of realistic experience without ever setting foot in Atlantic City. All you need to do is be in New Jersey, as per the casino’s requirements.</p>
<p>As long as you are, you will have access to titles such as Live Unlimited Blackjack, Live Baccarat, Live Three Card Poker, Live Casino Floor Roulette, and more. All games are also compatible with mobile devices making for a fun and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>The betting limits at the Golden Nugget Live Dealer Casino will vary from $1 per bet to $1500 and more. You can pick and choose the table that comes with the most flexible betting limits and adjust it to your bankroll.</p>
<p>Apps and Mobile Compatibility</p>
<p>The casino has the privilege to operate in fully legitimate markets, and as such, it’s allowed some unique perks. For example, the Nugget doesn’t have to worry about launching a dedicated app. Both Android and iOS software is already available for download and if you are keen to play on the go with a remote app.</p>
<p>The apps are available for download in New Jersey and Michigan. They will soon be launching in Pennsylvania as the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) allowed the Golden Nugget to launch without teaming up with a land-based casino in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>As a result, the mobile apps that the brand delivers are optimized to provide you with the best online gambling experience, feature all games, and more. You will find the experience to be quite entertaining and worthwhile, and we are sure you will enjoy yourself with full access to the iGaming portal through any device.</p>
<p>Payment Options and Banking</p>
<p>You should not worry about a thing when it comes to banking. Operating as a licensed website, Golden Nugget really can help you deposit and withdraw in a matter of minutes. The supported payment methods here include:</p>
<p>American Express</p>

<p>The regulator, that is the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE), has whitelisted all payment options. As a result, you can expect transactions to go smoothly and without any hiccups. If anything, this is the safest way to carry out transactions.</p>
<p>These banking options are quick and intuitive and will allow you to deposit as little as $10 at a time and withdraw just as much as the number of your minimum winnings.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>You can expect great customer service if you visit the operator’s physical casinos. Well, the same pretty much applies to the online casino that runs live chat, phone, and email support. You can call directly at:</p>
