    <h1>Gun Lake Casino Wayland Mi Railroad Pass Hotel Casino Inclave Casino Login River City Casino Hotel G</h1>

<p>My problem is exactly the same as hundreds of other users if you google DUEKZ CASINO REVIEWS - basically going round in circles for over a week with the verification process. I have submitted perfect documents which are easily accepted by other casinos, yet they keep either saying they aren't received or I need to send again or have failed. 2 days ago on the chat they finally confirmed all was ok and my withdrawal was being processed only to then get an email yesterday saying that due to non receipt of documents my withdrawal has been cancelled. I queried and they then asked me to email them which I did, but no word since and today they say they cant tell me what's going on only that I am still not verified and they are waiting for documents. It's clearly a pure scam, I've been using online casinos regularly for years and never once had a problem like this. and 165 other recent reviews on trustpilot are from people having the exact same experience as me and in all cases they had their account then randomly closed after a few weeks and never got their money. I saw one lady said she came to Casino Guru with her complaint and received her money but honestly I have no hope, there is no question this site is just a scam and it shouldn't be allowed as it will completely tarnish the whole industry if people lose confidence in the legitimacy of online casinos - it's honestly making me never want to use online slots again and I love playing! Can anything be done? I dont think going to the police will get me anywhere as it's a Maltese compny and they have better things to do than try and recover my Â£900 of stolen money</p>
