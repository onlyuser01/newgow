<p>EveryMatrix, a leading supplier of B2B products for the iGaming industry, has received its newest licensure in the United States, expanding its presence with its Connecticut entry. Moving forward, the company will be able to operate as a supplier in the state, adding to the prominent markets across the North American region where the company has a license to operate.</p>
<p>Other places where EveryMatrix currently operates include New Jersey, West Virginia, and Michigan. The company also holds a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario in Canada. Thanks to the Connecticut license, the company will be able to deploy a range of excellent games aggregated through its iGaming Integration platform, CasinoEngine, EveryMatrix explained in a press release.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix President Americas Erik Nyman has welcomed this fresh opportunity to be expanding in the country and consolidate the B2B provider’s solutions with US-oriented brands, across both the sportsbook and iGaming verticals. He added:</p>
<p>"With our license approval in Connecticut, we are one step closer to securing access to all the significant regulated states in the US and we are thrilled to go live shortly."</p>
<p>It’s an opportunity to step-up distribution as well, Nyman noted, confident that EveryMatrix’s expansion in the market will not stop there. The company set up an office in Miami, Florida back in August 2020 and has been doing well ever since. Previously, EveryMatrix obtained a license in Michigan at the end of last year, granting the distributor access to new operators and audiences.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has looked beyond securing licenses and has focused on putting them to good use. In fact, EveryMatrix recently teamed up with betPARX, negotiating a content deal with the respected US-facing operator. Other partners have also turned to EveryMatrix for content, including BetMGM which launched in October with the supplier in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The company is determined to continue expanding across the North American market as iGaming is picking up momentum in the regulated market in the United States and Canada. Presently, EveryMatrix employs 700 people across ten countries and serves 200+ customers worldwide.</p>
