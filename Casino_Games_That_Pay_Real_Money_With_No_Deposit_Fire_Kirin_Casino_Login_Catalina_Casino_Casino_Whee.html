<p>Baltimore Ravens have recruited Esports Entertainment Group as the NFL franchise’s esports tournament provider with a multi-year agreement. The group will organize esports tournaments for the Ravens twice a year in its Esports Gaming League (EGL) platform.</p>
<p>Esports Entertainment Group is a licensed online gambling company primarily focused on esports. In December last year, EEG signed the Philadelphia Eagles as well.</p>
<p>Going into the EGL to Facilitate Deeper Connections with Ravens Fans</p>
<p>“Our esports tournament platform continues to gain strong traction among top-tier professional sports franchises. We are delighted to add the Ravens as our latest partner.” CEO Grant Johnson stated.</p>
<p>He went on to add that the company’s diverse tournament platform will simultaneously help the Ravens strengthen connections with their fans and provide new ways of engagement.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens’ Chief Sales Officer Kevin Rochlitz agreed with EEG that esports is flourishing and is a way for the Ravens to deepen their connections with fans and increase communication and interest. He also stated he hoped the Ravens and EEG would have a long and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>EEG to Create Unique Video Content with Ravens Players</p>
<p>As a part of the agreement, EEG will have control over player imagery within the team’s local market. It will also promote the tournaments through creating custom videos with Ravens players that will be used in digital marketing campaigns across online channels like social media, email and mobile.</p>
<p>The Esports Gaming League platform provides gaming tournaments with full unlocked access to game enhancements and upgrades, along with exclusive features. Live broadcast production, game launches and online branded tournaments are also possible through the platform.</p>
<p>Magnus Leppäniemi, EVP Esports at Esports Entertainment Group commented that the company’s recent multi-year partnerships confirm the high quality of the multi-feature platform and its capacity to meet the needs of large-scale gaming events.</p>
<p>The company filed its gaming license application with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) earlier this week.</p>
