<p>The operator rides the momentum of the recent Camelot acquisition and seeks further expansion across the British isles</p>
<p>The Czech operator started the year on a high note, scoring win after win. The company won the auction to take over the UK lottery, closed out the acquisition of the Camelot Lottery Solutions Group, and set itself up for further expansion. Recent news suggests Allwyn plans to compete for control over the Irish national lottery, solidifying its hold over the region.</p>
<p>The Operator Enjoys Substantial Momentum</p>
<p>As the newest official operator of Britain’s National Lottery, Allwyn gains access to a substantial market well worth the initial investments. The company plans to modernize the country’s lottery offerings, prioritizing customer safety and superior player experiences powered by cutting-edge tech. To that end, Allwyn announced a partnership with Vodafone to facilitate a mobile-first approach and revitalize the lottery’s aging infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Czech group’s other recent victory came after acquiring its primary regional rival Camelot. The move hastened Allwyn’s entry into the UK market, giving the company a substantial head start in its revitalization efforts. Since Camelot LS Group is based in Chicago, the deal significantly simplifies a potential Allwyn foray into the US market.</p>
<p>Entering Ireland Would Be Another Significant Milestone</p>
<p>Despite the potential for overseas expansion, Allwyn’s eyes remain set on the Old Continent. According to a recent report by the Financial Times, the operator seeks to further grow its influence across the British Isles by purchasing a majority stake in the Irish national lottery. However, the process is shaping up to be anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>The Irish lottery is owned by The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), the same entity which previously held Camelot. The OTPP has opted for an auction, hoping the promise of untapped value and over a decade of lottery license left would attract sufficient investor attention.</p>
<p>High-profile operators like The Lottery Corporation, Française des Jeux, International Game Technology, and Scientific Games have already expressed interest, meaning Allwyn has an uphill battle ahead if it wants to compete. However, the company’s substantial experience, solid financials, and industry-leading solutions may be sufficient to give it an edge over the competition.</p>
<p>Allwyn Has All It Takes to Compete with Industry Heavyweights</p>
<p>The operator is well-prepared for a rigorous bidding process, relying on substantial revenue growth to fuel such expansion efforts. Allwyn’s preliminary 2022 financial results revealed a 23.8% year-on-year revenue growth, reaching €3.22 billion ($3.51 billion). With EBITDA also rising 20.8% to €1.17 billion (1.27 billion), Allwyn is more than capable of competing with other industry heavyweights.</p>
<p>The group can pursue plenty of other avenues besides Irish expansion. Allwyn’s substantial experience in countries like Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, and Italy has given the company insight into what it takes to succeed in diverse and challenging markets. With the Camelot acquisition complete, Allwyn can grasp the first available opportunity to expand its reach, whether in Ireland or overseas.</p>
