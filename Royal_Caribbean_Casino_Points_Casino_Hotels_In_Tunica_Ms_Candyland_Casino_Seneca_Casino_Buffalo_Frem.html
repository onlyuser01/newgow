    <h1>Royal Caribbean Casino Points Casino Hotels In Tunica Ms Candyland Casino Seneca Casino Buffalo Frem</h1>

<p>I still accept my deposits and deposits only if this is put in motion very shortly, or I will risk homelessness because I was relying on these funds when I was told they would be returned to me so quickly when I said I will accept just the deposits, this is after months of being ignored so you can understand why I was like okay we are getting to a solution I guess.</p>
<p>Which is when this case should have been sorted and this will have been resolved,</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I have had no contact from anyone relevant and have been totally ignored.</p>
<p>Please see my attachments.</p>
<p>This is currently still in the 'resolving' stage and hasn't been taken into force by anyone including licence issuer as there has been no requests from either party IE me saying I want the full winnings so it merely is a massive delay in just paying me the deposits back.... that's literally all that needs to happen now. It's clearly what they want they just want.</p>
<p>I haven't had a single piece of discussion with anyone but Chipstars and that's how it still is and plans to be at the current stage, I just want my deposits back so I can get on with my life,</p>
<p>This will speed it up I am sure.</p>
<p>I am being ignored everywhere cause that's all they can do now to avoid paying my funds.</p>
<p>I have provided an XMR wallet address in my most recent emails and telegrams conversations in which they can minus my winning and send my 3,387.13 USD in deposits . The same address is at the top of this complaint + in my email in which Chipstars replied the next day confirming they would return deposits if accepted. Obviously this case has been going on for a year almost plus you can't send Monero back to itself so I have to provide a wallet. Don't need any more deception.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started obviously it's my money it's not even considered a large amount in gambling sphere + I got notarised banking documents I sent to Chipstars months ago from a notary in the UK which cost me hundreds of pounds.... to then see no winnings.</p>
<p>Besides Chipstars have constantly contradicted themself for reasonings' as to why they wouldn't pay me the full winnings in the past, one minute it's because of not sending over the 10 millionth document, the next its because of something else. Always different. They couldn't even get my NAME right on some emails in the past. That shows how incompetent they are.</p>
<p>Once I hadn't heard from them in weeks and I made the Trustpilot and a day or so later they replied nonsensne on it, made a false flag trying to take it down which is against Trustpilot rules, sent me a rushed 2 minutes of thought email with more absurd questions like 'who is Ben French to you' - Ben French was my best friend at the time which I labelled him as in literally the previous response about something else which made whichever rushed responder come up with such a '''genius''' question . Who is Ben French? Well if you read what I said you would know..... disgusting. That seems like amazing KYC work to me doesn't it after WEEKS of waiting. &amp; other silly examples such as 'we want tax documents' even though in the UK not everyone has access to those because I don't need to pay tax on gambling they should know as they accept UK customers . joke. shows how incompetent they are at this gig. They just throw whatever in your face.</p>
<p>Another disgusting one when they asked for Bank statements they asked who's that and I said my parents. They then said they wanted proof from my parents that they sent me the money to help pay my rent or something absolutely absurd like that for like a 500 pound payment or something tiny. Absolutely disgusting considering I can't speak or communicate in any way to my parents currently and at the time for legal reasons.</p>
<p>I sent them an emergency hospital appointment letter as they requested more proof of address like a 10th document. That's how disgusting this is. Endless.</p>
<p>This is just scratching the surface on how ridiculous some of the questions and document requests got.</p>
<p>I'm surprised they didn't ask me to start performing one handed handstands with all the documents held between my toes whilst simultaneously answering questions. They have no bounds.</p>
<p>When I completed all this nonsense they then randomly say oh yes by the way we are going to forfeit your winnings because you abused the system. Absolutely untrue. This is a comedic accusation. I lose heavy majority.</p>
<p>On my Trustpilot they say I wasn't cooperative. Do you think for a second by looking at this complaint I seem like the type to not be engaged. They're the people that ignore you for months when they run out of reasons to not pay you. Yet I am the one labelled as this? When a review pops up they just make up a new reason as to why I am not being paid. I lost so much gambling in my life and thank god I quit.</p>
<p>Many people contacted me privately on socials about this saying they had carbon copy or similar situations.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Please ask Chipstars to resolve this,</p>
<p>Cameron</p>
