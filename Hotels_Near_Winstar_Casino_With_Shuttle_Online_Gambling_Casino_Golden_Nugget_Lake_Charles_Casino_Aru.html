    <h1>Hotels Near Winstar Casino With Shuttle Online Gambling Casino Golden Nugget Lake Charles Casino Aru</h1>

<p>Hi there this started about 2 weeks ago when I was playing at zen casino I play there live casino and I play blackjack it's provider is lucky streak now it started with me placing a side bet on perfect pairs I put a 50 dollar on and I lost the hand but got a mixed pair 6 to1it took all my money when I lost the hand and never paid I immideatlyy spoke to support gave them round I'd ect they said it will be investigated and should take 3 days and to talk to my casino not long after I did another side bet and the same thing happen I won and never got paid so after hours of typing headaches back and forth with my casino they finally sent me put the 350 dollars into my account I never saw the money for the other side bet amd I just get same thing over and over it's investigating but basically I don't even think they are doing anything about the other one and figured the first one if they just pay me that one I will shut up it was extremely difficult and time consuming to get that back now after this first payment was credited I had a bit more trust so I was playing again and I had a 11 with my first two cards a 7 and a 4. I had a 160 dollar bet from memory and choose to double down I pushed it the buttons went away and nothing happen they choose to stand on my 11 I was messaging them at the time everything but it stayed 11 and dealer pulled a 10 and won I meen I have never in my life see someone stand on a unbustable 11 it does not happen especially against a low dealer card it just dosent happen regardless I was playing for a while I never had no connection problems I kno the button was pushed it's not right so any way I msg again same old same old send us this go to ure casino blah blah I just put it down to ok something went wrong hopefully I get my money back until not long after I think may have been before but was same session anyway sorry hard to rember exact details as when u play it's alot of diffrent hands and happens fast but every fact about how it happen is the truth so anyway I believe one of my hands after this I decide to try my luk at pairs again seeing as it had been well over a week since the last 2 so I put down 15dollars on pairs and in comes to perfect 3s and the hand went on I lost the hand of 120 but didn't care I just won 25 to 1 on pairs I thought but no it took my 120 my 15 on pairs and 15 on the other side the 21+3 so 150 in total and didn't pay me a cent now that's a he'll of a coincidence that long after the only side bets I have done and not one of them paid but all of them took my money and I was playing the game no connection problems nothing all perfect the dealers even announced the pairs I told them they were even confused but couldn't help one even said they seem to have a problem at that table so I'm at least 560 out of hand I can't rember how much the second one from the first time was for and think from memory it may have been a 21 plus 3 side bet sorry can't rember but I sent all details to them and game number and nothing luck streak just ignore me zen just seems to send generated msgs and do t even read most of wat I say there never going to pay me and clearly there's something going on one of zens msgs we're if I'm not happy with lucky streak maybe I shouldn't play there I'm so thrustrated and it's not right can u please help me I don't kno what to do I will attach screen shot of incident I e not been paid for the two3s and if u want I can find the first one for u two and maybe the one we're I doubled on 11 and they never doubled it or hit so I lost thanks so much in advance for anything g u can do to help me regards Trent liptay p sorry i allso added a picture i tryed contacting lucky streak and they tell me ro go to there support there support bloks me and dosent even answer me its pathetic and zen casino closed my ticket this morning i forgot to tell u allso sorry about all this i just dont kno what to do ive never made a with drawal from them and put so much of my money into there casino its so upsetting that they steal from me thanks again</p>
