<p>I submitted my bitcoin withdraw request on 5/31, after a few days I emailed regarding payment. I’ve played on multiple Inclave sign in RTG casinos and my withdraws have always been processed and sent out in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The payout department tell me "Please be advised that it takes from 7 to 10 business days for approvals. Our withdrawal requests go through several department plus management for approvals. After they get approved, our department receives them and we sent them off to a third party vendor for processing."</p>
<p>My approval was processed on 6/15/2023, exactly 10 days after I had submitted it. I emailed the day approval since I had still not received anything asking when I could expect the payout to be deposited. I was told "We can't provide you an specific date on the payment but as soon as we get the payment confirmation you will be notified via email." I sent a few follow up emails in between and got responses very quickly with the same answers "The payment has not been sent to processor yet. As soon as we get any news on your payment an email will be sent out."</p>
<p>6/30/2023 – 10 business days after approval. I was waiting for an email all day telling me my payment was sent out, and I received nothing. I emailed at 4:50pm asking about payment and how I was expecting payment today.</p>
<p>7/1/2023 – I waited almost 24 hours and still no response with my past emails I was getting responses very quickly. I reached out VIA chat on the Sunrise website to find out my payment had still not been sent off to the "payment processor" I send another email to the finance department stating that I communicated VIA chat and was disappointed that payment had not been sent out, and that this is unacceptable, and that we were past all the maximums given for withdraw.</p>
