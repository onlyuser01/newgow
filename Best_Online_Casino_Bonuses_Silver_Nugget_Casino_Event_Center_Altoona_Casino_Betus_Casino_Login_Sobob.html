    <h1>Best Online Casino Bonuses Silver Nugget Casino Event Center Altoona Casino Betus Casino Login Sobob</h1>

<p>You are in the red at most casinos. ðŸ˜›</p>
<p>As you say, dear Radka, in the end the casino always wins, I'm well aware of that.</p>
<p>But I really play a lot! I am registered in really many casinos and have been for almost 2 decades.</p>
<p>I've been registered with win2day for at least 14 years and had the fewest wins there.</p>
<p>In 14 years I haven't won 1000x the bet once, which for me personally has nothing to do with luck anymore ðŸ™‚ but it's just my opinion.</p>
<p>I never rate casinos badly just because you have a streak of bad luck, but that's just not normal anymore because everyone can tell me what they want, the 14 years without a single good win speaks for itself.</p>
<p>As far as verification, support and everything else is concerned, win2day is great!!! But as far as profits go, the worst in my experience.</p>
<p>I make AT LEAST 2x a month a profit with 1000x the stake or more no joke!!!! Just not at win2day and that for 14 years!!! ðŸ˜‘</p>
<p>It's clear that luck sometimes runs out. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I've also had unlucky streaks that lasted 3 months, which unfortunately happens. But the fact that in 14 years you don't even get 1000x the bet or more has nothing to do with luck anymore for me. And like I said, I play really often and a lot, and by a lot and often I mean every day.</p>
<p>For you personally, it gets weird when you deposit for almost 2 decades but never really win anything. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The only reason why I still play daily at win2day is that I finally want to get a win with 1000x the stake or more because I absolutely can't understand how you can't get a significant win once in 14 years.</p>
<p>Free spins also come very rarely and when they are there they pay so badly that sometimes you can't find the words.</p>
<p>At other casinos it is also possible, so something is going wrong here ðŸ™‚</p>
