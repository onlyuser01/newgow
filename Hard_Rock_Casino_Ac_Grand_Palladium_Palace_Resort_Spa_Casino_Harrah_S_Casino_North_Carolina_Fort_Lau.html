    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Ac Grand Palladium Palace Resort Spa Casino Harrah S Casino North Carolina Fort Lau</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I opened an account with Igame and then I discovered that they have a trademarks at Unibet and Mariacasino and big players.</p>
<p>I chatted with their customer service and I asked if you could open an account with you if you self-excluded from Unibet maria and big players, then they said no that it is not possible, and I asked how it happened that you allowed me to open account with you (Igame) though I have excluded myself from Unibet maria and big players? Then she said that she will forward my case to the responsible department, and that I would receive a reply by mail. I waited a couple of weeks without getting any response. I heard from myself last week and wanted to know how my case was going then told them that they were waiting for update and that I would continue waiting. Nothing happened and yesterday I heard from myself again. And I was shocked when they said they couldn't see any self-exclusion. I asked how could that be possible. I have absolutely self-excluded myself from Unibet maria and big players, before opening an account with you (Igame).</p>
<p>The problem is when you chat with Mariacasino Unibet and major customer service then you meet the same person. I chatted with a girl named Nathalie at Igame and she said she can't see any self-exclusion at other companies I said ok then I went to Unibet to ask them why not go and login then I meet Nathalie again at Unibet and she said because i was self-excluded, i asked her if she was the same person i was chatting with at igame then she lied straight out and said no. I was both surprised and shocked. How can they play with me? Why can't they be honest and admit they made a mistake and just pay them back the money I lost.</p>
<p>Mvh Moses</p>
