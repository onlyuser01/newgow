<p>High 5 Games, an acclaimed supplier of award-winning games as well as technology for the iGaming sector, has struck a new partnership which will see the supplier offer its range of products to Hard Rock’s iGaming operations in New Jersey, United States.</p>
<p>High 5 Games is a company that has focused its efforts on the North American market and offers more than 500 casino games that are available to its various partners not just in the region but also in Europe.</p>
<p>Among some of the company’s most significant releases are games such as Green Machine, Da Vinci Diamonds, and Rapid Rewards, with the studio quickly scaling and establishing its footprint with established entities from the business such as Hard Rock.</p>
<p>Detailing the partnership with Hard Rock, High 5 Games Director of Client Partner Lauren Gazneli welcomes the chance to see the company expand its presence in the state of New Jersey and with Hard Rock.</p>
<p>"As a key player in New Jersey and a highly respected brand worldwide, Hard Rock is extremely important to us," Gazneli said. The director added that the supplier is now excited about the opportunity to introduce its games to wider audiences and bring more entertainment value to players in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Hard Rock and High 5 Games are no strangers, however. The two companies have already been working hard together to deliver titles across the land-based sector and Hard Rock properties in the United States. This new tie-up, however, will significantly scale the partnership and its reach, offering brand-new opportunities to players and the two companies involved.</p>
<p>High 5 Games is already excited about the future as it features a chock-full roadmap of fresh releases that will appeal to Hard Rock players in New Jersey, and well beyond. High 5 Games has been building up its profile in the iGaming vertical n the United States.</p>
<p>The company teamed up with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in Pennsylvania, bringing an array of games, including Dangerous Beauty, Golden Knight, and Jaguar Princess. The company obtained a license in Pennsylvania last year and has been looking to scale its presence in the Keystone State. In January this year, High 5 Games partnered up with BetMGM’s iGaming operations in the state.</p>
