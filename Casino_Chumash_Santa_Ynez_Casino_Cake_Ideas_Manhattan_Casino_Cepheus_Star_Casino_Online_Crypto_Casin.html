<p>Sports gambling has exploded with some 46.6 million Americans now expected to gamble on the 2022 NFL season. This mounting interest in sports gambling can be attributed to several factors, one of which is undoubtedly the mass legalization with the industry now launching or close to launching in 34+ states.</p>
<p>Massive Betting Driven by Legalization and… Twitter</p>
<p>But there is another factor at play here – the rise of the sports gambling Twitter. Brands and influencers have done tremendous efforts to ensure that they cultivate a following and make sports betting known to fans, new data by Twitter Insider Studies has revealed.</p>
<p>According to the data, 70% of all sports bettors are using Twitter and many are following influencers or seeking advice on what to bet next. In fact, only 15% of sports fans who bet on sports are not using Twitter. Sports bettors turn to the social media platform to seek answers, validation, or advice about wagers they want to place themselves.</p>
<p>Twitter has an informative role as well, as the majority of sports bettors use Twitter to quickly catch themselves up to speed with the latest odds, line movements, and injury reports, among other betting-impacting developments.</p>
<p>The study also revealed that many sports fans suffer from a fear of missing out, which is the feeling that if you do not bet on something right now, you would have missed out on a great opportunity. This is another driving factor that fits with Twitter’s own titbits-driven messaging system. Similarly, the study discovered that 65% of sports gamblers were motivated to join in on the action because of how prevalent certain games were on social media.</p>
<p>Four in 10 sports fans said that Twitter was their best betting source, and it helps combines oddsmaker content with opinions and insights from fellow sports bettors, influencers, and people who love the hobby. Meanwhile, the idea that Twitter can be an important driver of conversions and sports betting activity is not alien.</p>
<p>Companies Succeed to Drive Interest Through Social Media</p>
<p>Many companies have been actively building up their digital channels. Among them are Barstool Sportsbook, which has a reputation for building some of the most powerful Twitter and social media channels, but others have done well as well.</p>
<p>Companies such as PointsBet, DraftKings, FanDuel, and others have been long cognizant of the potential of the sports gambling Twitter, making sure that they reach out to new customers and compel them to place bets through their offers by presenting value-added content and opportunities.</p>
