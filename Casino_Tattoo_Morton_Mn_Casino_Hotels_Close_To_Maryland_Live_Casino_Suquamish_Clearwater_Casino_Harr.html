<p>In light of violations related to wagering and ethical conduct rules, Brad Bohannon, the former head coach for Alabama baseball, faced a penalty. The incident dates back to last year when the former head coach allegedly provided insider information to an individual who subsequently used it for sports wagering. This information becomes clear from a hearing panel by the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions.</p>
<p>After the violations were uncovered, Bohannon was fired. According to the NCAA, he also failed to properly cooperate with the investigation. This was another action that further violated the established rules by the NCAA. As a result of the violations and unethical behavior, the Division I Committee on Infractions imposed Level I-mitigated penalties for the university and Level I-aggravated penalties against Bohannon.</p>
<p>The penalty against the former Alabama baseball head coach includes a 15-year show-cause order. This order effectively prohibits Bohannon from holding any athletically related position with different institutions. “If Bohannon becomes employed during the show-cause period, he shall be suspended for 100% of the baseball regular season for the first five seasons of his employment,” explained the NCAA.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the school received a $5,000 fine. The Division I Committee on Infractions also approved three years of probation. Moreover, the school will continue to collaborate with EPIC Global Solutions, implementing effective education and training on gambling harm for its athletics administrators, coaches as well as student-athletes.</p>
<p>NCAA, “Deeply Troubled” with the Unethical Behavior</p>
<p>According to the NCAA, Bohannon sent text messages to a bettor who subsequently attempted to place a $100,000 wager on a game between Alabama and LSU dating back to April. While the bettor tried to bet the hefty sum, they were only allowed to wager $15,000 as a sportsbook flagged their bet as “suspicious activity.” This wager ultimately helped investigate the matter further which resulted in the penalty against the former Alabama baseball head coach.</p>
<p>“Integrity of games is of the utmost importance to NCAA members, and the panel is deeply troubled by Bohannon’s unethical behavior.“ Vince Nicastro, deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the Big East and chief hearing officer for the panel</p>
<p>Vince Nicastro, chief hearing officer for the panel and deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the Big East, spoke about the importance of integrity for the NCAA. He said that the unethical behavior demonstrated by the former coach was deeply troubling for the panel.</p>
<p>Nicastro acknowledged that administrators, student-athletes and coaches have access to sensitive information. Finally, he explained that the disclosure of any such sensitive information undermines the integrity of sport and sportsmanship.</p>
