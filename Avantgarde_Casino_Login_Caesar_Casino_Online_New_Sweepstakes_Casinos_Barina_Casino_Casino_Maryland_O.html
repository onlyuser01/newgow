    <h1>Avantgarde Casino Login Caesar Casino Online New Sweepstakes Casinos Barina Casino Casino Maryland O</h1>

<p>The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) is doubling down on its efforts to introduce a globally recognized responsible gambling program. The existing program, PlaySmart, has been re-launched as My PlayBreak and rolled out just in time for the National Football League (NFL) season which took place over the weekend.</p>
<p>My PlaySmart Aspires to Help Consumers Control Gambling</p>
<p>The rebranded program is focusing on voluntary participation and a more proactive approach whereby people can return to gambling if they choose to while still benefiting from strong safeguards along the way.</p>
<p>People who wish to exclude from gambling, though, can now do so through My PlayBreak which allows for quick and easy onboarding and enables consumers to gain full control of their gambling habits. Consumers may opt out of the interactive gambling experiences at OLG.ca, the Charitable Gaming Center, or provincial casinos.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new launch, OLG SVP brand, communications, and sustainability Alexandra Aguzzi said that OLG is determined to continue supporting players and consumers through the development of advanced responsible gambling tools. She added:</p>
<p>My PlayBreak is just one of the RG tools in OLG’s sophisticated and unmatched PlaySmart portfolio that is integrated across multiple product lines to help customers create and maintain healthy habits that enable a lifetime of sustainable play. Commenting on this new launch, OLG SVP brand, communications, and sustainability Alexandra Aguzzi</p>
<p>My PlayBreak is developed in a way that reflects current trends in the industry and consumer needs. Players have the option to self-exclude for varying lengths of time, ranging from 3 months to 6 months, to 1 year to 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years. The app is also linked to the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) and check-in calls are also listed as an option on the app.</p>
<p>Putting an Emphasis on Helping Consumers Succeed</p>
<p>The new initiative also accounts that some people may want to return to gambling, and the app and OLG have made the process very simple through a dedicated “Return to Play” option which will enable consumers to renew their participation in gambling, but only if specific criteria are met.</p>
<p>Responsible Gambling Council CEO Shelley White has hailed the My PlayBreak program as an important step forward to offering a more “person-centric” approach that makes it more accessible to control one’s gambling spending and habits. PlaySmart Centers will also be available at the 29 casinos in the province and the 37 charitable gambling centers, White said.</p>
<p>Overall, the app is also looking to create stronger connections to treatment and support services.</p>
