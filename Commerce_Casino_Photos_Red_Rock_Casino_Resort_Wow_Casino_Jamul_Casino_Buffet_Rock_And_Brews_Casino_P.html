<p>The leading online gaming operator that has a presence in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United States, PointsBet, announced the launch of a new product, expanding further its US-facing offering. The company confirmed the launch of PointsBet Racing, its brand-new horse racing product.</p>
<p>Details of the highly anticipated product emerged last week, and its launch came ahead of the Triple Crown. Thanks to PointsBet Racing, the company boosts further its growing position in the US. In fact, by now, PointsBet has a presence in 25 states and continues to expand its footprint within the betting vertical as a leading operator.</p>
<p>Now, the company's new product will deliver an "all-in-one horse racing experience," a statement released by PointsBet reveals. Johnny Aitken, PointsBet USA's CEO, shared his excitement about the new product saying: "The launch of PointsBet Racing marks a significant milestone in our efforts to expand our product portfolio and capture the tremendous potential of the US horse racing market."</p>
<p>He explained: "We are optimistic about replicating the success we have seen in mature global betting markets where racing is a huge engagement channel next to sports." Finally, Aitken pointed out: "This new offering will contribute to the growth of online horse racing in the US and we are excited to get live in advance of one of the most important racing events of the year."</p>
<p>The new product, PointsBet Racing, is the result of the efforts of PointsBet's team in collaboration with the business division of The Stronach Group and the leading thoroughbred racing company in North America, 1/ST TECHNOLOGY. The duo inked a partnership back in October. Under the terms of the deal, 1/ST TECHNOLOGY agreed to power PointsBet's product with a deposit pari-mutuel wagering platform.</p>
<p>Racing fans and bettors in more than two dozen states will be able to tap into PointsBet's new horse racing product. The app is available in different states such as Tennessee, West Virginia, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Ohio, Iowa and Delaware, among others. Additionally, PointsBet confirmed that it has pending license applications for its product for other states as well, where the company has established online sports betting or casino operations.</p>
<p>Customers that use the new product will be able to tap into unique features and coverage for top horse racing tracks around the world. PointsBet Racing will feature "content from each leg of the coveted Triple Crown, with over 180 tracks total from the US, UK, Ireland, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia," explained the company. What's more, users of the new horse racing product will benefit from live streaming and replay capabilities, as well as in-depth statistical data and easy options for deposit and withdrawal.</p>
