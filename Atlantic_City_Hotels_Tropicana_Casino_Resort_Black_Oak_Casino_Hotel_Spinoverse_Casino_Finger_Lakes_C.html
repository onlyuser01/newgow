    <h1>Atlantic City Hotels Tropicana Casino Resort Black Oak Casino Hotel Spinoverse Casino Finger Lakes C</h1>

<p>Hello, I deposited on this site around 8000 PLN somehow made back 7500 PLN, then proceded to withdraw it ..</p>
<p>Next day i'v got an email from them, thats said i have free cash on my balnce ''as a bonus '' it was 300 PLN.</p>
<p>I spinned it on 40 PLN and again somehow won 40000 PLN,then spinned it for some time till i end up with a 32000 PLN again i proceded to withdraw it .</p>
<p>Next day it was 15 PM im getting on my account to check if they sent my money, to my suprise my ballance was reduced by 33000 PLN and i ended up with 1,900 PLN on my account . I contacted support they said they reduced my balance due to me braking rules of casino which was bet size when spinning on bonus.</p>
<p>Even so i have lost 5,500 PLN which was in any way,shape of form connected to a bonus money that i have won and ended up with after i have tried to withdraw it .</p>
<p>Casino won't give my money back and so i would like to report it further, so more people won't end up in situation that im in right now.. basically me being scammed .</p>
<p>Cassino could cap bet size on bonus but they won't do it so they can steal money after it.</p>
<p>In conclusion ballance that i had tried to withdraw 35500 PLN</p>
<p>balance that i ended up with 1900 PLN</p>
<p>Best Regards:</p>
<p>Dawid C***</p>
