<p>International betting and gaming company SKS365 announced a new addition to its management team with the appointment of former NetEnt chief financial officer Lara Falzon.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased to welcome Lara to our talented executive team at SKS365 as CFO.” Alexander Martin, CEO, SKS365</p>
<p>Gaming Industry Veteran</p>
<p>Lara Falzon will fill the void left by SKS365 previous chief financial officer who left the company in January 2019 and will relieve the company’s chief people officer Brian Dean who had to operate in a dual capacity ever since.</p>
<p>“SKS365 is among one of the leaders of the Italian betting and gaming industry and I am thrilled to contribute with my expertise to further drive the company’s growth and transformation plans.” Lara Falzon, CFO, SKS365</p>
<p>The new addition to the company’s management team Falzon who will report directly to SKS365 chief executive officer Alexander Martin, brings a wealth of financial and gaming industry experience to the gaming operator.</p>
<p>“Lara brings a wealth of experience in M&amp;A activity and leading financial operations across international markets combined with in-depth industry experience from working at various gaming companies.” Alexander Martin, CEO, SKS365</p>
<p>Her most recent role, an operational chief financial officer at NetEnt since February 2020, proved to be instrumental to the acquisition of the gaming technology supplier by Evolution Gaming. Falzon transitioned to the role after NetEnt acquired Red Tiger in 2019, the company at which she held the title of chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Accepting the New Challenge</p>
<p>“I am delighted to join the company at this time and I am looking forward to working with the team to execute on the company’s priorities, accelerate growth and enhance value for shareholders and all stakeholders.” Lara Falzon, CFO, SKS365</p>
<p>Falzon who holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Malta and is a fellow member of the Association of Chartered Accountants, joined Red Tiger in April 2018, having worked as CFO at mobile gaming company King and then for two years performing as group CFO of Evoke Gaming.</p>
<p>“Finance is a key function at SKS365 supporting actively our growth and profitability targets and I am delighted to have Lara leading our excellent finance team.” Alexander Martin, CEO, SKS365</p>
<p>Lara Falzon joins SKS365 in a period of intense growth for the operator and challenging times for the industry, and her appointment brings new optimism, as for the Italian business, so for the global brand Planetwin365.</p>
<p>Her addition serves as a testament to the significant progress SKS365 already achieved on the path to becoming a world-recognized gaming industry brand.</p>
<p>For the past year-and-a-half, SKS365 elected to focus its efforts exclusively on the Italian market where it managed to replace bet365 in the top 5 sports betting ranking in February, generating €19.1 million in revenue.</p>
