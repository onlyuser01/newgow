<p>BetMGM, the sports betting and iGaming brand born out of the partnership between MGM Resorts and Entain, has moved to strengthen its position in Ohio ahead of the state’s official sports betting launch on January 1, 2023, by teaming with the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>Entertaining and Dynamic Betting Experience</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement between BetMGM and the MLB’s franchise named the gaming operator an Official Sports Betting Partner of the Cincinnati Reds and will see the opening of BetMGM Sportsbook at Great American Ball Park.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Adam Greenblatt, chief executive officer of BetMGM, revealed the operator’s plans “to create the most entertaining and dynamic sports betting experience in Ohio,” starting with the partnership with the Reds.</p>
<p>“Through our relationships with the Reds and MGM Northfield Park, we look forward to bringing unique BetMGM content to Ohio’s passionate sports fans,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Occupying the space that is currently operating as the Machine Room restaurant on the northeast side of the stadium, the BetMGM Sportsbook will allow fans to watch games and place bets throughout the year, providing access from outside the ticketed areas of the ballpark via the arena plaza level entrance.</p>
<p>Doug Healy, chief financial officer of the Cincinnati Reds, commented on the partnership, outlining the Reds’ intent “to bring the highest quality operator” to Great American Ball Park and cater to the needs of “those fans who choose to participate in sports gaming.”</p>
<p>“BetMGM is renowned for their expertise in entertainment and sports gaming, and we believe their brand best fits our high customer standards and will also help draw visitors to our city,” Healy added.</p>
<p>The BetMGM Sportsbook mobile app will provide another opportunity for fans of the Cincinnati Reds to wager on their favorite team, offering pre-game, live in-play, futures, and parlay wagers customization as part of its user-friendly mobile gaming experience.</p>
<p>Unwavering Commitment to Professional Baseball</p>
<p>The partnership with the Reds is the latest display of BetMGM’s unwavering commitment to professional baseball signaled by the agreement in 2018 that made BetMGM the first-ever Official Gaming Partner and Entertainment Partner of the MLB and the recent extension of the relationship by naming BetMGM MLB’s Official Sports Betting partner.</p>
<p>BetMGM signed an exclusive betting partnership with another franchise from the league, Houston Astros, earlier this year to mark the first sports betting and iGaming partnership of the operator in Texas.</p>
<p>The agreement also has provisions for collaboration with the Astros for promotional efforts in neighboring Louisiana.</p>
