<p>Collaborating with Camelot, the current operator, Allwyn aims to ensure a seamless transition for retailers during the shift of duties</p>
<p>Allwyn, the incoming licensee for the Fourth National Lottery Licence, has unveiled its comprehensive plan to assist National Lottery retailers ahead of the changeover scheduled for February 1, 2024.</p>
<p>National Lottery Retailers to Transfer Agreements to Allwyn by December 2023</p>
<p>Under the existing arrangements, all Retailer Agreements are signed with Camelot. However, with Allwyn set to assume operating duties, retailers will need to transfer their agreements electronically to Allwyn by December 18, 2023. This process will enable them to continue offering National Lottery services without any interruption.</p>
<p>Allwyn will assist National Lottery retailers in electronically transferring their agreements through an online portal, while Camelot Retail Sales Executives will visit retailers to explain key changes and address queries before signing the new agreements.</p>
<p>The new Retailer Agreement will maintain commission levels for National Lottery Draw-Based Games, Scratchcards, and prize payments at the current rates. Payment terms for all games will also remain unchanged. Furthermore, bonds and Direct Debit mandates already established with Camelot will be automatically transferred to Allwyn.</p>
<p>Katharine Challinor, Allwyn’s Retail Director, expressed gratitude to National Lottery retailers for their continued support and acknowledged the significant role they play in raising £30 million ($38.7 million) every week for Good Causes across the UK.</p>
<p>Allwyn and Camelot Forge Detailed Timeline for National Lottery Transition</p>
<p>Allwyn and Camelot have created a detailed six-month timeline for a smooth transition. It includes ongoing site surveys by Momentum In-store until September’s end. There will also be pre-planned Lotto and EuroMillions event draws, and exciting National Lottery Christmas activities, including festive Scratchcards and special event draws, to sustain The National Lottery’s strong performance during the Third License period.</p>
<p>After the Agreement transfer deadline on December 18, retailers can anticipate receiving a ‘Welcome to Allwyn’ pack in the New Year. The pack will contain more information about the changes expected from February 1, 2024, including initial details about new and improved National Lottery games starting in March 2024. Retailers will also receive information about the required digital training ahead of the changeover.</p>
<p>With Allwyn poised to assume the National Lottery duties following the ten-year license awarded by the UK Gambling Commission in September 2022, the company has fully acquired the business of the current license holder, Camelot UK. Camelot has been the sole operator of the National Lottery since its inception in 1994, winning all three of the previous license contests.</p>
<p>Additionally, in March, Allwyn successfully acquired the Camelot Lottery Solutions Group, solidifying its position as a leading brand in Europe and marking its entry into the US market. Allwyn has also set its sights on acquiring a majority stake in the Irish national lottery, aiming to solidify its presence across the British Isles.</p>
