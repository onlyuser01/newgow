<p>The new collaboration will enable BetMGM to introduce mobile and retail sports betting once the state launches its legal betting market</p>
<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming operator, BetMGM, announced a new market access agreement, complementing its growth across the United States. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with Revolutionary Racing Kentucky (RRKY). Under the terms of the new market access agreement, BetMGM will be able to launch online sports betting, once Kentucky opens its legal sports betting market.</p>
<p>In addition to online sports betting, the leading iGaming and betting company plans to introduce a retail sports betting outlet in collaboration with RRKY in Kentucky. The new, BetMGM Sportsbook will be located at Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming. The 5,200-square-foot retail outlet plans to open this autumn. Still, it’s important to mention that BetMGM’s launch into the mobile and retail sports betting market is subject to regulatory approval and securing of relevant licenses.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the new retail sportsbook will further boost the entertainment at RRKY’s $75 million gaming and entertainment facility located in Ashland, Sandy’s Racing &amp; Gaming. Besides the new BetMGM Sportsbook, the construction of the state’s first quarter horse racetrack and equestrian center is expected to start. The new entertainment location will be adjacent to Sandy’s and will use approximately 182 acres of land with first races expected to start at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The announcement about BetMGM’s expansion comes on the heels of an important deal in New Jersey. Last week, the company revealed that it signed a multi-faceted partnership along with Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa for the delivery of Evolution Gaming’s Dual Play Roulette for customers in the state.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Prentice Salter, Revolutionary Racing’s CEO, explained that the company vowed to deliver world-class entertainment to Ashland. According to him, for that goal, a world-class partner was needed, and Revolutionary Racing found this partner in the face of BetMGM.</p>
<p>“We promised to bring a world-class facility to Ashland and wanted a world-class partner for online sports wagering across the Commonwealth and at our sportsbook lounge. We’ve got that with BetMGM.“ Prentice Salter, CEO at Revolutionary Racing Kentucky</p>
<p>Late last month, BetMGM released its H1 2023 results, highlighting strong performance with net revenue hitting $944 million. Besides its first half of 2023 results, the company released an update in its outlook for the full-year performance, confirming it is on track to achieve revenue between $1.8 billion to $2 billion by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“Revolutionary Racing is an ideal partner, enabling us to deliver an entertaining and responsible gaming experience, while investing in the state through job creation and tax revenue.“ Adam Greenblatt, CEO at BetMGM</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM’s CEO, outlined that there are passionate sports fans in Kentucky. According to him, RRKY is the perfect partner for the company in the state. Finally, Greenblatt pointed out that the collaboration will help create new jobs, raise tax revenue and deliver thrilling and responsible entertainment for sports fans and bettors alike.</p>
