<p>There are only three races left before the end of the 2022 season of Formula 1. We already know that Max Verstappen is going to retain his title, but there are many other things left to fight for. He’s got a chance to break the record for most wins in an F1 season, which surely is going to fill him with motivation at the 2022 Mexico City GP.</p>
<p>Verstappen isn’t the only one who’s going to be fired up at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc is going to try to keep himself in the #2 position in the F1 World Drivers’ Championship standings. For that, he needs to do better than Mexico’s best driver, Sergio Pérez.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Going for Glory</p>
<p>Three more races are left on the 2022 Formula 1 calendar, but we already know who the champion is. The man in question is Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing, who managed to secure the title after winning 13 of the 19 races run so far this year. He’s made sure that the title will stay in his possession for another year, but this doesn’t mean Verstappen has no motivation in the remainder of the F1 season.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the young Dutchman has a chance to break the record for the highest win percentage in a Formula 1 season. That record is currently held by Michael Schumacher, who won 13 of 18 races in 2004, which equals 72.22%. If Verstappen wins each of the remaining three races of the 2022 season, his percentage will go up to 72.72%.</p>
<p>Verstappen also has a special motivation to win Sunday’s race – if he does it, he’ll become the driver with the most wins in Gran Premio de la Ciudad de México.</p>
<p>Verstappen to Help His RBR Colleague?</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the winner of the 2022 Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship. His team, Red Bull Racing, is the winner of the 2022 F1 World Constructors’ Championship. Whatever happens at the Mexico City GP, nothing will change that.</p>
<p>There is something, however, that can change before the end of the season. Another Red Bull Racing driver can move up to the #2 position. The man in question is Sergio Perez, a Mexican driver who’ll be driving in front of his own crowd on Sunday.</p>
<p>However, it’s not fans who can help him do well in this race, it’s his teammates. Perez is currently two points behind Charles Leclerc but winning the 2022 Mexico City GP would mean overtaking his position. Actually, Perez doesn’t have to win on Sunday to leapfrog Leclerc; he only needs to pass the finish line before Ferrari’s driver.</p>
<p>2022 Mexico City Grand Prix Prediction</p>
<p>Since July 10, only Red Bull Racing drivers have won the no.1 spot in F1 races. Verstappen did it on eight occasions; Perez did it once. We think an RBR driver will win once again. The only question is who is it going to be – record-chasing Verstappen or Perez who’s set his eyes on the #2 position in the Drivers’ Championship?</p>
<p>We think Verstappen will finish first, with Perez just behind him. This way, both drivers would make their plans come alive.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Verstappen to win</p>
