<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming has launched in Pennsylvania, the latest iGaming state where the acclaimed operator and brand is breaking ground with its streamlined casino app experience. The Golden Nugget Online Gaming casino app solution is powered by DraftKings technology and brings more than 500 games to pick from, and numerous genres too, including slots and classic table games.</p>
<p>Players will discover a number of excellent and popular titles to experience, including blackjack, roulette, craps, and more, along with some of the industry’s leading online slots that have become instant player-favorites.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Matt Kalish, President of DraftKingsNorth America, hailed the opportunity to see the Golden Nugget Online Gaming casino app expand to yet another state and make it possible for local players to enjoy what he described as an unrivalled gaming experience.</p>
<p>"The app is powered by our leading technology, which dynamically brings hundreds of popular casino games and exclusive content to our customers' fingertips," Kalish added, pointing out the benefits of the experience. He further said that players in Pennsylvania will get access to rewarding promotions, spot-on customer service, and a smooth user interface that all come together to bring unmatched experiences to players.</p>
<p>The Golden Nugget Online Gaming casino app has launched in a number of states across the country, including Michigan, West Virginia, New Jersey, and others, as the company seeks to gather momentum in new and promising markets. There are still more frontiers in US iGaming to explore, which Golden Nugget Online Gaming will undoubtedly pursue.</p>
<p>The iGaming vertical has been fast-developing in the United States, attracting operators as well as suppliers. Although the past several years have been mostly about the legalization of sports betting, businesses have been discovering the high added value of online casino operations in terms of revenue.</p>
<p>This is why an increasing number of brands are pushing into this vertical. PokerStars, the world’s leading card room, has recently teamed up with White Hat Studios to strengthen its portfolio and offering in the online casino segment in the United States as well. Meanwhile, Golden Nugget Online Gaming still has a few states to enter, including Connecticut, when it comes to online casinos.</p>
