<p>Power of Merlin Megaways and Gates of Olympus remain some of the hottest games on the market</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading game developer that supplies cutting-edge titles to the casino industry, has once again demonstrated why it is a market leader by grabbing all three GamblingNews slot awards in July.</p>
<p>The two games that received accolades are the player favorite titles Power of Merlin Megaways and Gates of Olympus. Sporting many distinguishing features, the former title was named Slot of the Month, as well as Most Watched Slot Game. The other game, meanwhile, secured GamblingNews’ Most Streamed Slot Game award.</p>
<p>Let’s see what makes these two titles so special.</p>
<p>Cast Mighty Spells in Power of Merlin Megaways</p>
<p>A great addition to Pragmatic Play’s Megaways lineup, Power of Merlin Megaways is a game that puts players in the shoes of the legendary mage from the King Arthur legend. The slot sports many of the player engagement mechanics Pragmatic Play is popular for and is certain to engage people who are passionate about dynamic and innovative features.</p>
<p>In addition to the Megaways mechanic, Power of Merlin Megaways leverages the highly popular Tumble feature that sees winning symbols disappear, allowing players to win multiple prizes with a single spin. Engagement is further bolstered by Wild symbols and the Lighting Bolt feature, as well as by a Free Spins round.</p>
<p>Rub Shoulders with Zeus in Gates of Olympus</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus is a game that will send players directly to the highest peaks of the mountain where the Greek gods reside. Slots enthusiasts will collect gemstones and magical artifacts to score huge wins and return to the realm of mortals richer.</p>
<p>The 6×5 game has 20 paylines and, just like Power of Merlin Megaways, leverages the Tumble feature to increase player excitement. Clusters of 8 or more symbols score a win and then disappear, allowing other symbols to replace them. This not only allows players to win multiple prizes but also makes triggering Free Spins easier.</p>
<p>Speaking of Free Spins, players can also increase their wager to double the chance of triggering the Free Spins round.</p>
