    <h1>Ballys Casino Chicago San Manuel Online Casino Tres Reyes Casino Horseshoe Casino Bossier Peppermill</h1>

<p>Dear trent1,</p>
<p>We have reviewed the additional evidence provided by the casino and thoroughly reviewed the entire case once more.</p>
<p>Based on all the evidence that has been provided by both parties, the decision has been made to discontinue our investigation of this complaint.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, we thoroughly disagree with any winnings being confiscated for the reason of "responsible gambling".</p>
<p>However, the casino also claimed that you have registered a second account using a Gmail address and that both accounts have accepted and used a bonus. Upon looking at the deposit history, there is also evidence to suggest that both accounts have been used simultaneously (repeatedly on the same day). Although the winnings were accumulated without the use of the bonuses, this is still a direct breach of the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the duplicate account was not detected straight away. We firmly believe that these checks work better if they are implemented at the point of registering an account, but this is not the current standard throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Initially, you stated that you did not open a second account, but as well as confirming that the Gmail address used to open this account was yours, you also later stated that you may have opened a second account accidentally. You further mentioned that you had proof showing your balance at the time your account was closed was much higher but were unable to provide this.</p>
<p>The evidence provided by the casino is sufficient in supporting their claims and it seems they have acted in accordance with their terms and conditions regarding this case.</p>
<p>I appreciate that this is not a satisfactory solution to your issue and that you refute the claims of the casino, but please understand that our decision can only be made based on the evidence we have at hand.</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that you would like to take this matter further, I recommend you contact The Curacao Antillephone Gaming Authority and submit a complaint to them (complaints@gaminglicences.com). Please do let me know how they respond (adam.m@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
