<p>The newly secured license helps the company expand further its US-facing footprint and enables it to deliver its leading iGaming and sports betting services and solutions to new customers</p>
<p>The provider of a leading business-to-business turnkey platform, sportsbook and casino, EveryMatrix, continues its expansion in the US after announcing it secured another license. The company revealed Thursday it secured a license in Connecticut, expanding further its foothold in the country.</p>
<p>Securing a license in Connecticut marks a major step for EveryMatrix, considering that the state offers online sports betting, as well as online casino gambling. It was back in 2021 when Connecticut introduced legal forms of the two activities and since then, it has become a major market for iGaming and sports betting operators.</p>
<p>The recent license is expected to provide a boost to the company’s growth. This is an important step for EveryMatrix as it will clear the path and enable the provider to join forces and supply its content and services to partners in the state.</p>
<p>The Leading Provider Continues US Expansion</p>
<p>Erik Nyman, EveryMatrix’s president Americas, explained that the company remains committed to growing further its presence in the US. He said that states offering both sports betting and iGaming are of particular interest to EveryMatrix, considering that the company provides leading solutions for the two verticals.</p>
<p>“EveryMatrix has focused on US states that have regulated both iGaming and sportsbook as we are leading supplier in both verticals. With our license approval in Connecticut, we are one step closer to securing access to all the significant regulated states in the US and we are thrilled to go live shortly.“ Erik Nyman, president Americas at EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Nyman added that securing a license in Connecticut represents a major step for the company as it grants it access to a major US market that offers both iGaming and online sports betting. He pointed out that EveryMatrix is excited and looking forward to introducing its services to partners in the state soon. In conclusion, Nyman outlined that the license in Connecticut complements the company’s expansion strategy and enables it to introduce its leading platform and content to licensed gambling operators in the state.</p>
<p>“This is another significant milestone for the business and widens our reach to distribute our world-class content, platform and services to licensed operators in the US market,“ added Nyman</p>
<p>Besides Connecticut, EveryMatrix is currently in the process of expanding its services to another state, Pennsylvania. With that in mind, previously, the company has entered other strategic jurisdictions such as the markets in Michigan, New Jersey and West Virginia. EveryMatrix also has a presence in Ontario, Canada.</p>
