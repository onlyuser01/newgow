<p>2019 WSOP Europe kicks off today, October 13</p>
<p>The event will offer €22m in guaranteed prize money</p>
<p>New formats and more budget-focused approach introduced</p>
<p>The 2019 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Europe kicks off today, Sunday, October 13 through November 4, in Rozvadov, the Czech Republic. Set to start at 6 PM local time, the event will offer more than €22,000,000 million in guaranteed prizes spread across 15 gold bracelet events that will take place at the King’s Resort Casino. The WSOP is returning to Rozvadov for a third year in a row now.</p>
<p>This year’s edition will bring forth as many as 15 bracelets which is higher than any previous WSOPE event so far. Plus, the prize pool has grown substantially from 2018’s €21,977,184 million in prize money. The organization has focused on more affordable events, and players may sign up for as little as €350 No Limit Hold’em event, which sets the entire WSOPE in motion this year.</p>

<p>WSOP Back at the King’s Resort</p>
<p>Commenting on the preparations that have gone in putting together the event at King’s Resort, WSOP Vice President Jack Eiffel had this to say:</p>
<p>“Leon and his team have been great partners for WSOP Europe and while the dates of the 2019 event haven’t changed, we were able to find some room to add some exciting new events that will drive bigger prize pools and keep players busy.”</p>
<p>Leon Tsoukernik, the owner of King’s Resort, has been pushing the Czech Republic and his own resort as a hub for poker in Europe for a while now. Tsoukernik has previously made headlines over a dispute with Matt Kirk, a professional Australian player who played against at the ARIA Super High Roller Bowl.</p>
<p>Tsoukernik claimed that the casino had conspired and got him drunk so that Kirk could finish him off at the table, which happened and the Czech national lost $3 million. He then filed a lawsuit that was dismissed.</p>
<p>Yet, King’s Resort has proven a fantastic spot for anyone interested in competitive poker. Located right at the German border and in the very heart of Europe, the venue is a perfect spot for any European who wants to travel and compete.</p>
<p>WSOP Europe Events and Attendance</p>
<p>With 6,000 players turning up for last year’s Europe, this year’s attendance rate will be another weathervane as to which way poker in the Old World is headed. In terms of events, there will be quite a few highlights, including the €25,000 Short Deck High Roller No-Limit Hold’em.</p>
