<p>Coolbet is doubling down on its efforts to better engage with its customer bases in the highly-dynamic region</p>
<p>The operator will now seek help from Enteractive, a company with a proven track record in retaining and reactivating dormant player accounts across the sports betting and iGaming verticals. As a result, Coolbet and Enteractive will work together across various Latin American markets where the operator is present.</p>
<p>Enteractive to Help Coolbet Reactive Consumers in Latin America</p>
<p>Enteractive will implement a number of its reactivation and retention tools with Coolbet and help it to ensure that there are fewer registered non-funded player accounts, as well as conduct targeted reactivation campaigns designed to connect with lapsed players.</p>
<p>Enteractive uses an advanced proprietary solution known as the (Re)Activation Cloud platform, which will allow the company to target individual players and connect with them via a one-on-one conversation by phone. Enteractive puts a great focus on a personalized approach that allows it to elicit strong results and responses from players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coolbet itself is fully committed to responsible gambling practices that it wishes to maintain even if it leverages a more powerful reactivation tool such as the solution offered by Enteractive. The operator has been focusing on ensuring that players can afford to bet financially and that they are well psychologically and will uphold this core value moving forward as well.</p>
<p>Coolbet head of marketing operations Julija Moisenko welcomed the opportunity to see this partnership with Enteractive form:</p>
<p>This partnership enables us to stand out from the competition and demonstrate to our players that we care about their experience. We are excited to see the results of this collaboration. Coolbet head of marketing operations Julija Moisenko</p>

<p>Retaining and Engaging with Players Through Personalized Solutions</p>
<p>“This partnership enables us to stand out from the competition and demonstrate to our players that we care about their experience. We are excited to see the results of this collaboration,” Foster said.</p>
<p>Enteractive has been working with a number of companies in the sector, including Rootz, which became one of the latest operators to seek out the provider’s solutions. The company also managed to sign another important partnership with BetCity, which will focus on the Dutch market and shows that Enteractive is capable of operating even in the most robustly regulated markets in the world.</p>
