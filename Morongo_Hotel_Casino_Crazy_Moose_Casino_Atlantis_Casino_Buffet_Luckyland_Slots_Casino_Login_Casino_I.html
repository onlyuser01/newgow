<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Altenar will supply its leading solutions and services for MiCasino in both Peru and Chile. Upon announcing the deal on Tuesday, the company confirmed that expansion of the collaboration to further markets can be expected as well.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new deal, MiCasino customers will benefit from Altenar’s leading online sportsbook platform. This will deliver the company’s state-of-the-art betting software, as well as sporting markets and pricing for the operator, expanding its offering.</p>
<p>Besides Altenar’s sportsbook platform, the new deal is expected to deliver quinielas, lottery and virtual sports products for MiCasino. Ultimately, the new products are expected to not only boost the offering of the operator but expand its presence in the LatAm region as well.</p>
