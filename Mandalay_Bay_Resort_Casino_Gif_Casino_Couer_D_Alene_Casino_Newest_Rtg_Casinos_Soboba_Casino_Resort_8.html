<p>888 has launched its latest initiative, SheLEADS, to get more women involved in the gambling industry’s top echelons. The initiative, which is designed to “nurture and develop outstanding talent,” is focused on gender equality while taking individuals at their merit.</p>
<p>888 is pushing to introduce a more inclusive working environment, a long-standing goal of the company, as it tries to set a benchmark for workforce diversity. A total of 31 female employees will attend meetings weekly and work with various experts under the SheLEADS initiative to boost the individuals’ personal branding and communicative abilities.</p>
<p>Building up for the Future</p>
<p>What is learnt in those meetings would then be applied back in the participants’ daily lives within 888’s pecking order. The initiative has been welcomed by all, including 888 Group CEO Itai Pazner who said:</p>
<p>“The launch of SheLEADS perfectly aligns with our commitment to nurture and develop outstanding talent who I believe will help inspire the next generation of rising leaders both at 888 and across the industry.”</p>
<p>The initiative ends in January when each participant is going to attend the the SheLEADS On Stage where they would be able to showcase their newly acquired skills and talk about their personal and professional path.</p>
<p>Committing to a More Diverse Workforce</p>
<p>The initiative is another step forward for the company on its quest to create outstanding workplace values. 888 has similarly worked on GR8, another initiative it has leveraged to encourage fairness at the workplace, introduce diversity and nurture talent.</p>
<p>888 is similarly looking to increase the number of women leaders within its ranks by 10% by 2023, referring to senior positions. Pazner is confident that embracing diversity and empowering talented individuals of all backgrounds has given 888 the ability to stay competitive and continue shaping its future.</p>
<p>This comes at a pivotal moment for the company as it continues to experience strong growth in the third quarter of the year.</p>
