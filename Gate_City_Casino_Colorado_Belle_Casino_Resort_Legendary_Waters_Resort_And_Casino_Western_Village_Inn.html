    <h1>Gate City Casino Colorado Belle Casino Resort Legendary Waters Resort And Casino Western Village Inn</h1>

<p>Knowing that there is a basic rule that governs the operation of each and every slot machine, namely RNG, knowing that there is also hit frequency, which means the frequency that a slot machine rewards in your bets, also knowing that there is assertiveness rate, the modification and change in the RNG pattern.</p>
<p>Knowing that there are three operating plans for a slot machine, MEDIAN, RETENTION AND DISTRIBUTION, which alternate with each other over a period of approximately 24 hours.</p>
<p>I would like to open this topic with you, slot machine masters and apprentices:</p>
<p>How a Slot's operating software changes its patterns, based on the casino operator's artificial intelligence, that is; Which of these overlaps the other and predominates?</p>
<p>I have also noticed as a player of several slots, 5 channels, 6 channels, 7 channels, Megaways, and also 3-channel slots, of which I highlight one that was or is still in fashion, the Fortune Tiger from PG.</p>
<p>I have noticed that this slot machine has deprived its players of winnings on minimum bets and also on low bets, I have also noticed that it has put a bit of an end to the so-called "tiger party". Dramatically reducing your award rate. Post your views and suggestions on this topic for mutual growth.</p>
