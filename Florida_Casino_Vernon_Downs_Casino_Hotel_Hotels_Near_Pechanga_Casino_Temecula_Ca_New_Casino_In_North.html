<p>Europe’s leading lottery operator, Allwyn, plans to strengthen its British team by hiring a new chairman of its United Kingdom lottery operations. The company will proceed with this move if it has been successfully selected as the next National Lottery operator.</p>
<p>Allwyn Sets Its Sights on King</p>
<p>If Allwyn gets picked as the next British National Lottery operator, it will reinforce its local team by adding the experienced Justin King as chairman.</p>
<p>King is a veteran businessman with years of experience in prestigious positions. He has previously served as the chief executive officer of Sainsbury’s, the second-largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. King’s tenure in Sainsbury’s lasted for a decade. He left the company in 2014 and, a year later, became the interim chairman of the Formula 1 racing team Manor Racing.</p>
<p>King is currently one of Allwyn’s advisors and is closely overseeing and supporting the operator’s bid. Allwyn is after King’s years-long experience in the retail sector. However, it was emphasized that if Allwyn loses the race, it will not proceed with the aforementioned appointment.</p>
<p>This announcement comes ahead of the outcome of the Fourth National Lottery License Competition. Currently, the best lottery operators are fighting over the prestigious position of a National Lottery operator, with each hoping to replace the current operator Camelot.</p>
<p>King is Honored to be Selected</p>
<p>Sir Keith Mills, who assists Allwyn in its application for becoming Britain’s next National Lottery operator, spoke on the company’s decision to select King as its to-be chairman. Mills pointed to King’s tenure in Sainsbury and how the latter managed to revitalize the company thanks to his knack for “delivering transformative change at large organizations.”</p>
<p>Mills added that King’s profound knowledge of the British retail sector and his genuine want of renovating the British high street will be a great asset for Allwyn’s operations as a potential National Lottery operator.</p>
<p>“Through his role on Allwyn’s advisory board, Justin has been pivotal over the course of our application; his appointment as chair, should we be selected, is a natural evolution, playing to his strengths and further enhancing our credentials.” Allwyn advisor Sir Keith Mills</p>
<p>King is delighted to be selected as Allwyn’s to-be chairman. He revealed that he has been impressed by the operator’s track record of delivering peak lottery content and will be glad to lead its world-class team.</p>
<p>“It would be an honor to lead Allwyn as operator of the National Lottery, playing our part in guiding this treasured institution into a new era.” Allyn’s advisor Justin King</p>
<p>Two months ago, Allwyn was still known as Sazka Entertainment. However, the company rebranded to better reflect its foray into the global lottery market.</p>
