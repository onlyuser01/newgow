<p>Iga Swiatek (WTA No. 1) is locking horns with Aryna Sabalenka (No. 2) in the final of the 2023 Madrid Open on Saturday, May 6</p>
<p>Iga Swiatek has already achieved a lot this season, despite a relatively poor start (R4 exit at the Australian Open). Since dropping out of the Aussie Slam, she’s 21-2, and is on a 9-match winning streak. Can she make it 10 on Saturday against Aryna Sabalenka? Odds suggest so, but let’s see what we think.</p>
<p>Swiatek vs Sabalenka Madrid Open Odds</p>

<p>Spread Odds Over 20.5 -120 Under 20.5 -120 *Odds taken from bet365 on Friday, May 5, 2023.</p>

<p>Iga Swiatek Becoming the “Queen of Clay”</p>
<p>Iga Swiatek is the best female player in the world, who plays almost equally well on all playing surfaces. Still, there’s one type of court that she’s been outstandingly good on – clay.</p>
<p>The evidence of this is that despite being only 21 years old, the Polish player has already won two French Open titles. And the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that uses clay courts.</p>
<p>Further, Swiatek won her most recent trophy at Stuttgart, another tournament played on clay. In the final of the 2023 Stuttgart Open, she defeated Sabalenka 2-0 (6-3, 6-4). It was her sixth win over the Belarus player, to whom she’s lost twice so far.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that both of those losses happened on the hard court. When it comes to Swiatek vs Sabalenka matches played on clay, the Polish player is 3-0, winning every time in straight sets.</p>
<p>Is There a Way Aryna Sabalenka Can Stage an Upset?</p>
<p>Aryna Sabalenka is coming into the final of the 2023 Madrid Open as an +275 underdog. Given her history with Swiatek, those odds are actually shorter than they’re supposed to be.</p>
<p>But they’re probably going to get longer before the start of the match. In fact, the growing trend has already started as evident from the fact that Sabalenka’s odds when the markets opened were +250.</p>
<p>Even though she’s definitely one of the best players in the world, she’s not the best one. Instead, it’s Swiatek. Sure, anyone can have a bad day, including the Polish sensation, and if it happens on Saturday, Sabalenka will be glad to use it to her advantage. But will it happen?</p>
<p>Swiatek vs Sabalenka Madrid Open Prediction</p>
<p>In the semifinal of the 2023 Madrid Open, Iga Swiatek steamrolled Veronika Kudermetova (WTA No. 13), winning 2-0 (6-1, 6-1) in just 80 minutes. Sure, Sabalenka is a tougher opponent than Kudermetova, but we’re almost 100% certain Swiatek can handle her. This goes especially because the Madrid Open final is played on clay, Swiatek’s favorite surface.</p>
<p>Pick: Iga Swiatak to win; under 20.5 games</p>
