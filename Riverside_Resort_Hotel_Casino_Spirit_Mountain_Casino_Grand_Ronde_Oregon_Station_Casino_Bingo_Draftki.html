<p>In their first game of the 2023 NFL season, the Cincinnati Bengals got humiliated by their Ohio-based rivals, the Cleveland Browns 24-3. It was Joe Burrowâ€™s first game since becoming the highest-paid NFL player of all times but we saw the quarterback throw the career-low of 82 yards. Will he do better in Week 2?</p>

<p>Baltimore Ravens Hate Playing on the Road</p>
<p>Last season, the Baltimore Ravens went 8-9, with only three of those eight wins happening on the road. Further, these guys have some really bad memories from their trip to Cincy. In fact, they lost each of the last three Ravens vs. Bengals games.</p>
<p>The duel with the Bengals is going to be their first away game in the 2023 NFL season, in which theyâ€™re currently 1-0. In Week 1, they defeated the Houston Texans at home, which was expected as they were -500 favorites. What was kind of surprising is that they won 25-9, that is, by 16 points, even though the spread was set to 10 points.</p>

<p>Baltimoreâ€™s defense did great in that game, while their offense did great rushing-wise. Each of their three touchdowns was scored by running backs â€“ Justice Hill (two TDs) and J. K. Dobbins. Unfortunately, Dobbins suffered a torn Achilles in that game and will miss the remainder of the season for that.</p>
<p>Another thing that should worry the Ravens is that their passing/receiving game wasnâ€™t too impressive, with Lamar Jackson throwing 17 for 22 for 169 yards, no TDs, and one interception. Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made his Ravens debut in that game, catching two passes for 37 yards, with no TDs.</p>
<p>A Must-Win for Cincinnati Bengals</p>
<p>Joe Burrow was horrible in Week 1, and the highest-paid NFL player will need to do much, much better this time. Heâ€™s got the capability to do so, but his teammates will have to help him out. The Cleveland Browns defensive end destroyed the Bengals offensive line â€“ even recording a sack on Burrow â€“ which is a signal that the Bengals need to improve this area.</p>

<p>The Bengals were horrible offensively, but what about their defense? They werenâ€™t too impressive either. Still, the fact is that the Browns offense was brilliant in that game. Nevertheless, the boys from Cincy will have to do much, much better defensively in Week 2.</p>
<p>The good news for their fans is that they seem capable of neutralizing the Ravensâ€™ strongest offensive weapon which is rushing. After all, in the last three Ravens vs. Bengals duels, they conceded only one rushing TD, which was scored by Kenyan Drake whoâ€™s no longer in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs. Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>The Ravens look like an ideal opponent for the Bengals to bounce back to the winning track. Cincyâ€™s defense is good against rushing anyway, while Baltimore is now without one of its key running backs (Dobbins). Further, we should also see Burrow lift the Bengalsâ€™ offense to a whole new level â€“ he needs to show that heâ€™s worth his record-breaking contract extension.</p>
<p>Picks: Cincinnati Bengals to win and cover the spread</p>
