<p>London Stock Exchange-listed gambling technology and financial trading company Playtech has sealed a new partnership deal with Lottomatica, the largest Italian group in the public gaming sector and also one of the most important players on the Europen continent. According to the terms of the deal, the latter will join Playtech’s iPoker network in Italy.</p>
<p>The news comes after the launch of Goldbet.it earlier in the year. Playtech’s vice president of interactive gaming Marat Koss expressed the company’s excitement to be able to welcome “one of the most established brands in the Italian market” to their network dedicated to iPoker aficionados.</p>
<p>“Long and Successful Partnership” on the Horizon</p>
<p>Koss also praised Lottomatica’s decision to select choose Playtech as its new provider, further explaining it as a means of showcasing their “commitment to the Italian market,” their iPoker network and product, and the vertical in a wider sense. Koss explained Playtech was expecting a “long and successful partnership” with the operator that is part of the Gamenet Group. Lottomatica is known for having an impressively long and solid heritage in the gaming market in the country where it is ranked in the fifth position in terms of poker operators in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>Lottomatica also used the voice of its managing director of betting &amp; digital for Italy, Alessandro Fiumara, to express its delight regarding the new partnership with Playtech, and also for joining “the largest iPoker network in Italy.” Fiumara spoke about Playtech’s long history of investment in the Poker market in Italy and other parts of the world, as well as the company’s ambition and “long-term vision” in regards to Poker, which turn them into the “ideal choice of provider.”</p>
<p>Over Five Decades of Experience Between Lottomatica and Playtech</p>
<p>Fiumara also spoke about the “natural partnership” between the two companies which is expected to further grow in light of more than five decades of experience. Playtech was founded in 1999 and it currently employs more than 6,600 people spread across 26 countries. The company supplies its technology on a Business-to-Business basis to top online and brick-and-mortar gaming operators, along with retail casino groups and entities sponsor by governments.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, Mansion launched two brands in Ontario with the help of Playtech’s backend solution. Lottomatica provides “safe and engaging gaming experiences across all sales channels,” with a strong emphasis on responsibility and sustainability. Last month, Lottomatica introduced Play’n GO hits to the Italian market.</p>
