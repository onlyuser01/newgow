    <h1>Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa Casinos Colorado Lake Havasu Casino Morongo Casino Room Rates White</h1>

<p>Good day, I registered with this casino on June 24 and requested self-exclusion on July 2. Despite this, I have continued to receive countless offer emails from those claiming to be the manager of my account, even though it was closed.</p>
<p>They encourage me to return and play every time they write to me, prompting me to reopen my gambling account, deposit money with a promotional code and this bonus is not credited. I request again to close my game account and ask that it not be reopened for any reason via email, but they make the request and send me additional offers and messages... Therefore, I reopen the next day and lose more money. To date, I have sent messages and emails to both the VIP manager and customer service and have not received a response.</p>
<p>I believe it is not right to be invited to play while under self-exclusion, let alone if I request that the account not be reopened, only for it to be reopened the next day.</p>
