    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Online Casino Real Money No Deposit Casino Slots Slot Mach</h1>

<p>Because a lot of them owe me $$$ not a lot and I’m giving them every chance to make it right or fix the issue and when a casino says they are renting there software for gaming? Everyone knows that one and yes I have the screenshots of the text and then the casino and guru will say that the text are altered and if I provide the proof then I get my account closed and guess what ? I only have access to a few because they are spreading it around to block me and they can and will read all this so I’m just getting better from my sickness and also like Kieran says whose side are you on ? I know more about this stuff then you can imagine I’m trying to help everyone as best as I can and in the past you have been treating me like I’m the bad guy all I can tell you if I have so much documentation it’s overwhelming and it takes time to gather it especially when we are talking about almost every online casino out there and I was laid up for four months the more information I provide the more everybody wants and they say there’s not enough proof there and that’s because most people don’t understand it unless you have played the games online that I have for thousands of hours your not going to understand it and i understand nobody does phone calls at guru and I asked guru 10 times how can I text my screen shots a different way then adding them to this text then it says I’m over the limit and nobody has provided me with a better way I even emailed guru and I didn’t get a response when I email to a casino 20 screenshots they say what’s wrong and say can you provide more information or I wish you would learn what a winning payout is ok it’s frustrating I have 2000 at least winning spins that didn’t payout win I hit them it show zero payout on everyone from all these places we are talking about and then it gets a lot more complicated so when some would like or suggest a better way I’ll listen I’m doing this to help others and these are all 100% based on my play which is documented in my history of play because I screenshoot that and just about everything else because guess what when I complain to the casino it disappears and then I supply my screenshots of it and they say rubbish they aren’t going to admit what there doing and the players who read guru before playing are few so they appease guru most of the time because it’s only a small percentage of there profits . What if I said I own or run a bunch of these myself ? Whether licensed or not would you know my point is that it’s very difficult to prove anything and even when you can ok you get a few dollars back now even when on play on a phone or iPad a screenshot can only do so much right so I have someone video my play so then I can explain what’s wrong however whoever</p>
<p>plays these games at these online casinos knows exactly what I’m talking about so I’m just telling them what to look for and I only submit complaints if I win and they don’t pay me which is never because I provide them with proof I am just replying to players making complaints where I have played 25, 50 or 100 times so I’ve seen it all and Kieran is spot on with everything he has stated and I have yet to read a complaint from a player that I haven’t experienced myself at the online casino they are referring too so they are all honest legit complaints if I read one that didn’t seem right I would ask or reply with a question</p>
