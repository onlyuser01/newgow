    <h1>Fairgo Casino Login Tulsa Hard Rock Casino Treasure Bay Casino Hotel Watch Casino Royale Station Cas</h1>

<p>Checkd Media’s poker division has added two new executives who will help the company spearhead its growth in the vertical. The first is Lee Johnston, who will be helping the Manchester-based firm as its new poker manager.</p>
<p>He is joined by Sophia Darling, who will work as a poker executive. The two together will look for ways to forward Checkd’s poker strategy, which has pivoted around the Footy Accumulators Poker League, powered by PokerStars.</p>
<p>Johnston’s experience and prowess in the area are quite diverse as he previously served as head of events for Ace King Group and oversaw hosting and organizing marketing projects for numerous established brands in the space, including PPPoker and KKPoker.</p>
<p>The campaigns would focus on a diverse selection of markets, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He similarly held roles at Bwin.party’s World Poker Tour as manager and created VGC Poker, another respected industry brand.</p>
<p>Darling, on the other hand, has similar field experience, having created content for PokerStars and worked for the card room as a freelance data analyst. She will help boost the company’s growth and connect with the 1.5 million social community it currently has.</p>
<p>The Footy Accumulators Poker League has been one of the most successful social experiences in the poker world. Checkd media launched the solution during the pandemic, and it has been able to gather momentum over the last months.</p>
<p>A particularly auspicious moment for the company has been the tie-up with PokerStars allowing Checked to quickly float its product with millions of poker players while PokerStars has been able to benefit from an optimized offer that revitalizes its signup offers, tournaments, and other player-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>Checkd Media managing director Alex Beecham had this to add on the company’s future plans in relation to its highly successful Footy Accumulators Poker League product:</p>
<p>“Lee and Sophia both bring with them significant knowledge and experience from the poker world. We are excited to have them on board as we continue to grow what has quickly become an essential element within our varied product mix and one that drives traffic while providing rich entertainment for our communities.” Checkd Media managing director Alex Beecham</p>
<p>Both Johnston and Darling welcomed the appointments with excitement and determination to take Checkd Media to the next level. Johnston said that he would commit to the Footy Accumulators Poker League so that the solution could get “to the next level.”</p>
<p>Darling shared her excitement to be working on the solution and said that growing demand from the social community for poker means that she will be working on realizing an offer that brings the best entertainment value for consumers.</p>
