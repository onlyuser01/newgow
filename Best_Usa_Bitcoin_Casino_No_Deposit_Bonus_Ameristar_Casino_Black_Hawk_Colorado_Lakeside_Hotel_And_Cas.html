<p>Total Performance Data (TPD) partners up with PA Betting Services to roll out a new innovative product, which will be available to over 40 bookmakers, aiming to engage a younger audience.</p>
<p>Total Performance Data and PA Betting Services Join Forces</p>
<p>Total Performance Data (TPD), one of the world’s biggest and fastest sources of live horse racing data, has teamed up with PA Betting Services, a global supplier of racing data for the UK, Ireland, India, South Africa, and the US. Together the two companies will deliver live horse racing data and content to more than 40 bookmakers worldwide.</p>
<p>This collaboration could turn out to be one of the biggest horse racing deals in decades, as it could provide a whole new betting experience in the industry, which can attract a new, younger audience of bettors who would like to engage with the sport.</p>
<p>How Does It Work?</p>
<p>The live odds engine is fed the industry Starting Price after which the probabilities are uniquely generated by neural networks trained on velocity and GPS position data. This opens up a raft of in-running betting opportunities like those enjoyed across all other major sports where live data and live prices translate to in-play betting forming over 70% of turnover.</p>
<p>PA will offer the new product and prices in the same format, in which it delivers its pre-race data. Additionally, the company will apply price margin to provide customer-ready odds, which will allow operators to focus on resources on the user interface and stop price suspension at the off, which is the moment the race receives the maximum betting attention. Bettors will also have partial cash out if their horse runs well. Operators will be able to offer “stake insurance” where bettors would see their stake returned if their horse hits evens in the race. These are just examples of product innovation, which aims to boost margin, turnover, and engagement.</p>
<p>PA Betting Services Aims to Bring More Revenue to Retailers</p>
<p>The collaboration with TPD is yet another initiative for PA Betting to bring more revenue to operators. Recently, the company partnered up with BoscaSports, bringing the supplier’s content to BoscaSports’ partner sportsbooks. The deal between the two brands will cover football, greyhound racing, and horse racing.</p>
<p>When commenting on the deal with PA Betting Services, TPD CEO Will Duff Gordon said that PA Betting Services is a natural choice, considering its race data market dominance. The company has a long history of providing pre-race data and prices. TPD hopes to leverage on the relationships PA Betting Services has already established. Gordon said that this is an exciting deal, which will allow operators to capture more racing turnover.</p>
<p>Head of Business Development at PA Betting Services, Richard Duncan, said that the company is delighted to work with TPD and boost its company presence. The company is pleased to offer these prices. He said that PA Betting looks forward to working with operators, integrating the prices as seamlessly as possible.</p>
