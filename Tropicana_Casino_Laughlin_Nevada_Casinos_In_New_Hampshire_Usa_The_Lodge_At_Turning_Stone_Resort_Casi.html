    <h1>Tropicana Casino Laughlin Nevada Casinos In New Hampshire Usa The Lodge At Turning Stone Resort Casi</h1>

<p>Stakelogic Live, the supplier of live casino products for the namesake Stakelogic brand, has announced a new ambitious content partnership with LeoVegas, an established purveyor of iGaming platforms and experiences across a number of verticals.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live Becomes LeoVegas’ Latest Live Casino Supplier</p>
<p>Moving forward, LeoVegas will benefit from Stakelogic Live’s distinct offer of live dealer content as the company is joining as a premium supplier of popular live casino titles. The content integration is facilitated by Relax Gaming, which is an aggregation partner to Stakelogic Live. Stakelogic Live COO Olga Bajela welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live is now a must-have provider for operators looking to deliver the best live dealer content to their players and we look forward to seeing those at LeoVegas sit down at our network tables and experience first-hand what they have to offer. Stakelogic Live COO Olga Bajela</p>
<p>This tie-up will result in LeoVegas adding Stakelogic Live’s network tables and gameshows to the brand’s domains covered under a license in Sweden and jurisdictions that allow operators with Malta Gaming Authority licenses to run iGaming activities.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live is bringing a number of popular live dealer picks, such as roulette tables, blackjack, and more. Stakelogic Live has state-of-the-art production facilities that secure unmatched experience, offering excellent cameras, microphones and broadcast tech that comes together to create an immersive experience.</p>
<p>The tables offered by Stakelogic are broadcast against a backdrop of popular gaming venues from all over the world. Stakelogic Live produces its own games and titles from its dedicated studio in Birkirkara, Malta.</p>
<p>LeoVegas players will have access to a number of excellent opportunities to play popular choices, such as Super Stake Roulette 5,000X. The Live Casino experience is further topped up by Stakelogic Live’s highly trained live dealers who can provide players with an unmatched experience across a number of tables, including European Roulette, American Blackjack and Stakelogic’s various gameshow games.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Is Committed to Bringing Quality Content to Players</p>
<p>LeoVegas director of live casino Rokas Benetis was equally pleased with the new partnership. Benetis said that this was a clear sign of commitment to LeoVegas’ players, and the addition of an innovative live casino partner such as Stakelogic demonstrates as much.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has been active in the European gaming market. Previously, the company expanded its content reach with BetNation in the Netherlands. Other than investing in great content, LeoVegas has been a prominent proponent of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>The company recently announced a funding and research program with the Karolinska Institutet’s Department of Clinical Neuroscience in Stockholm in order to help better understand problem gambling and early prevention.</p>
