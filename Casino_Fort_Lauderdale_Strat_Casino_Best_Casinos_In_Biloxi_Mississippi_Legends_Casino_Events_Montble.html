<p>Two long-term gaming executives with significant experience within the vertical were recommended for licensing by the Nevada gambling regulator, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), a report released by Las Vegas Review-Journal reveals. One of the executives was Julie Cameron-Doe, Wynn Resorts’ chief financial officer, while the other one was Joe Asher, IGT’s president of sports betting and chair of the Board at The Wilson Center.</p>
<p>The recommendation for new licensing came during two separate hearings in Carson City. The NGCB recommended Cameron-Doe for an officer, while Asher was recommended for licensing as a key executive. The two discussions resulted in unanimous approval. Besides the recommendation, the duo is expected to receive final approval for their licensing during an NGCB meeting planned for April 20, 2023.</p>
<p>Cameron-Doe’s recommendation for licensing comes as no surprise, considering her extensive experience within the gaming vertical. Currently serving as a chief financial officer at Wynn Resorts, Cameron-Doe joined the company back in 2021. She took over the role of Craig Billings, who was appointed as CEO of Wynn at a time when Matt Maddox left the company.</p>
<p>Before Wynn Resorts, Cameron-Doe was a part of the leading provider of gaming solutions, Aristocrat, for nearly a decade. Besides the role of a chief financial officer, during her tenure with the company, she was also a group general manager of finance.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Cameron-Doe has secured many licenses. Overall, she has pending licensing applications within 13 different jurisdictions. NGCB’s board member, George Assad, acknowledged that Cameron-Doe’s approval for licensing was “a slam dunk,” considering her extensive experience and knowledge within the sector.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Asher is also a seasoned iGaming industry veteran with significant knowledge and a deep understanding of the gaming vertical. His extensive experience includes close to a decade as CEO of William Hill US, the US-facing arm of the gambling giant William Hill.</p>
<p>Moreover, Asher was also the president and CEO of Brandywine Bookmaking, a company he helped form in 2006. After a few years of successful business, the company was sold to William Hill in 2021 and this is when Asher became the CEO of William Hill US. Brandywine remained an asset for William Hill until it was sold to Caesars a few years ago.</p>
<p>More recently, Asher joined IGT in October 2021 and is currently holding the role of president of sports betting. Last month, he was appointed as chairperson of the Board for The Wilson Center, a non-partisan policy forum for research and open dialogue.</p>
