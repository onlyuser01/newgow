<p>Evoplay, a leading game developer, has received two awards at the EGR Marketing and Innovation Awards for launching one of the most innovative marketing campaigns in the history of the online gambling industry. The two awards were given in the B2B Marketing Campaign and Supplier Marketing Campaign categories.</p>
<p>Judges Were Impressed With Evoplay’s Unique Approach</p>
<p>The event, which was held at The Hurlingham Club in London on June 14, highlighted the biggest achievements from the best companies in the iGaming industry. In Evoplay’s case, the judges were fairly impressed with the approach that the company had towards its marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they underlined the impressive reach that the company had via branded merchandise, comic books, and art books. Moreover, Evoplay brought web AR-based technologies into the world of iGaming and that was enough for the judges to hand out two prestigious awards.</p>
<p>Around the time of launching the marketing campaign, Evoplay also launched Star Guardians, which helped the studio deliver amazing results both in acquiring new customers to its platform, as well as the retention of a new audience.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay’s CEO, commented on the recent success at the EGR Marketing and Innovation Awards by saying that innovation and marketing are two of Evoplay’s strongest powers and that everyone at the company is delighted to receive the double recognition at the awards show.</p>
<p>Kravchuk ended by saying that these awards are a “recognition of the hard work and dedication” of the entire team at the company and that Evoplay is excited to see what the rest of the year has in store.</p>
<p>Evoplay Signed Multiple Deals in 2022</p>
<p>So far, 2022 has been nothing short but amazing for Evoplay. Not only did the studio enter the Italian market and started expanding in Europe, but it also signed deals with multiple gambling companies.</p>
<p>At the end of April, Evoplay teamed up with CasinoMentor, a player-orientated platform, and started supplying the casino with its content. Not only that, but the studio teamed up with Oryx Gaming and the two parties started collaborating together to reach new business heights.</p>
<p>Most recently, Evoplay shook hands with Fortuna Entertainment Group, and thanks to the deal, Evoplay will provide the latter’s brands with dozens of new games. Moreover, the company agreed to help PSK Casino, a Fortuna Entertainment subsidiary, organize various tournaments which will roll out very soon.</p>
<p>The brand and sponsorship manager at PSK Casino, Mekinic Bozo, stated that he’s looking forward to working with Evoplay. He also stated that his team is happy to have the opportunity to provide players with new games. In total, Evoplay will supply PSK Casino with 43 titles.</p>
