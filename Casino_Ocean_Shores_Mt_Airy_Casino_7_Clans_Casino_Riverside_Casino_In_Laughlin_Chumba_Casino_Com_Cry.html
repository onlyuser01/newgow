    <h1>Casino Ocean Shores Mt Airy Casino 7 Clans Casino Riverside Casino In Laughlin Chumba Casino Com Cry</h1>

<p>I register for this site through a link ***.io, two days ago. The promotion gave me 3 mBTC for signing up. My recollection of the sign up process recalls it being stated that you had to pay through 180 mBTC and you could withdraw winnings. I play Baccarat with the deposit and appear to have exceeded the 180 mBTC. I accumulated 26 mBTC in my account before I tried to withdrawal. When I check in the AM, my entire balance is voided. A conversation with customer service tells me that because I bet more than 1mBTC everything was voided. They pointed me to a provision of the terms and conditions that stated</p>
<p>5.7 Max Bet</p>
<p>The maximum bet amount allowed is 1 mBTC/33 mBCH/147 mLTC. Exceeding this bet amount could result in winnings being forfeited. This includes double up wagers after the game round has been completed, for example, wagering winnings from X game round on red/black. Players are limited to bets that do not exceed 0.86 mBTC/29 mBCH/126 mLTC per round and 0.054 mBTC/1.82 mBCH/7.93 mLTC per line when playing with an active bonus. Any bets that exceed these limits will cause all winnings to be void.</p>
<p>That is bullshit, plain and simple. I'm no stranger to the legal arena and no one reads this shit. It doesn't matter if you do. You are either going to play or you aren't. I would have been fine with the bet size, if you limited how much I could bet. Why is anything over 1 mBTC available to bet. Why do you stop me from betting 5 mBTC, only when I withdrawal the bounty. I get what terms and conditions are, but when they are used to deceive they are a problem.</p>
<p>There is no way you can make me understand anything other than this was a trap door to never have to authorize a withdrawal. Choose something else... Anything else!!</p>
