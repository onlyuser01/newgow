<p>Wizard Games, the leading provider of games for the iGaming vertical and NeoGames subsidiary, announced the launch of its latest slot game, Golden Elk. The newest game from the iGaming content provider invites the players on an exciting adventure to a forest full of enchanted animals and grants a chance for big prizes.</p>
<p>Golden Elk features an RTP that varies between 96.25%, 94.01% and 88.00%, offering medium to high volatility. Wizard Games' new slot game displays the reel at the center of a screen while a magical forest serves as a background. On the left side of the reel, the game's three jackpots can be seen, while controls such as bet size and auto-bet options are seen on the right.</p>
<p>The recently released slot game brings vibrant colors and uses standard card symbols between Jack and Ace. Additional symbols that can be seen on the reels include enchanted creatures such as a fox, an owl and a rabbit, among others.</p>
<p>Golden Elk supports 15 different languages and offers 50 paylines. The game promises exceptional experiences thanks to its jackpots and Free Spins, offering a chance for mouth-watering prizes. The release of Golden Elk grows Wizard Games' portfolio and follows the release of recent hits like Treasures of the Count and Grand Pepper Party, among others.</p>
<p>Benedict McDonagh, Wizard Games' Managing Director, was delighted about the recently released slot game. "Golden Elk sees us exploring an enchanted forest in our latest release, where our dazzling graphics clearly shine through," he explained in a statement. McDonagh outlined that players of Golden Elk can expect an action-packed game full of respins and free spins, features that are likely to appeal to a wide range of players. Finally, he said: "2024 is set to be a milestone year for us, and weâ€™re delighted to kickstart it with this exciting new release."</p>
<p>Players of Golden Elk can trigger free spins by landing three or more scatters on the reels. This unlocks a bonus round where five additional spins are awarded whenever two scatters land, granting a change for up to 30 free spins.</p>
<p>On the other hand, landing six or more Golden Elks on the reels unlocks the game's respins bonus. Once this happens, the players are taken to a special three-reel bonus wheel. Landing icons on the reels light up a number between 1 and 9, causing the spin to reset. Players who are lucky enough to light up all pointers can secure Golden Elk's mouth-watering Grand Jackpot.</p>
