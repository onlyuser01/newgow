<p>The fast-expanding iGaming studio has signed a seminal content partnership with Yolo Group’s brands and will now strengthen consumer engagement for the websites</p>
<p>7777 gaming is effectively bringing its full portfolio of more than 100 games across both Sportsbet and Bitcasino. The initial launch focuses on 25 of the supplier’s titles, which will be gradually scaled up to cover the full list of games along with future releases.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Portfolio of Cutting-Edge Innovators</p>
<p>Yolo Group is a noteworthy company in the iGaming sector, a ground-breaking innovator, and the operator behind Sportsbet and Bitcasino, the leading iGaming websites. The brands were launched in 2014 and 2016 for Bitcasino and Sportsbet respectively and were part of the vanguard of new, blockchain-focused casino experiences that have evolved and grown to cater to thousands of players globally.</p>
<p>Since then, both brands have increased their footprint and significantly influence the iGaming space demonstrating that crypto technologies can be embedded into the traditional online casino experience safely and reliably with a clear consumer focus. Yolo Group recently secured a partnership with Livespins to further innovate the type of interactive product available in its content library.</p>
<p>7777 gaming account manager Larisa Karaboycheva welcomed the chance to see the supplier’s portfolio hit the ground running with both companies, and outlined what it would mean for both Yolo Group and 7777 in the long run:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to go live in these strong, innovative, and outstanding brands such as Bitcasino and Sportsbet, part of the Yolo Group family. Our games are designed to bring the best experience to the end-user, and we are confident that their players will enjoy them. We are looking forward to extending our portfolio and working together with Yolo Group in the long run. 7777 gaming account manager Larisa Karaboycheva</p>
<p>Although Sportsbet.io is a standalone sports betting platform, the company has expanded into iGaming and has been a known innovator in the betting space too, securing access to esports markets as well as traditional sports. The company teamed up with Oddin.gg to boost its presence in the esports vertical.</p>
