<p>Thunderkick has announced the release of Midas: Golden Touch Christmas Edition with Multiplier Wilds and Bonus Games</p>

<p>Players eager to experience the magic of the holiday season through a themed slot should get ready to set on a “unique golden adventure” while exploring the mesmerizing world of the iconic King Midas.</p>
<p>The release of Midas: Golden Touch Christmas Edition follows the launch of Hot Potato and Bones and Bounty, two slots that have already drawn the attention of a large number of players.</p>

<p>Thunderkick’s product owner, Mike Collins, spoke about the “fantastic festive update” brought to one of the studio’s most successful games, praising the additional excitement that the fresh slot is expected to bring to players.</p>
<p>In this regard, he mentioned the bonus buy option, along with the Wild Multipliers and the Free Spins bonus rounds that attract boosted winning opportunities.</p>
<p>Collins also took the opportunity to express their confidence that players will appreciate coming across the fan-favorite game with “thrilling new additions.”</p>
<p>Turn Everything You Touch Into Glittering Gold</p>
<p>Reach the Greek king’s pantheon and admire the Christmas decorations with twinkling lights and trees on the list. Keep your eyes on the chalices, crowns, and Midas symbols, and cross your fingers for Midas’s golden hands, which is the Wild symbol in the game.</p>
<p>This symbol can replace the rest of the symbols on the grid. At the same time, all paylines that feature the symbol offer a multiplier of up to 32x, depending on the exact number of Wilds seen landing.</p>
<p>Players who land at least three Scatter symbols during any spin in the base game enter the Free Spins bonus round, where they are given 10 free spins.</p>
<p>Land three more Landing Scatters during this round to obtain 10 extra free spins. While still engaged in the bonus round, all winning symbols will remain locked on their positions for a respin. The feature will go on until there are no more additional winning symbols that can land.</p>
<p>Wild symbols can also be randomly placed on the reels prior to a round of free spin for more winning opportunities.</p>
<p>Players willing to pay 80x the base bet can purchase the Bonus Buy feature and jump right into the Free Spins bonus round.</p>
<p>In August, Thunderkick launched Grand Melee, a slot with premium sound effects, excellent features, and award-boosting options. The release came shortly after the company inked a content agreement with Gamingtec.</p>
<p>At the start of June, the studio entered the LatAm market with Rush Street Interactive and Rushbet to its side.</p>
