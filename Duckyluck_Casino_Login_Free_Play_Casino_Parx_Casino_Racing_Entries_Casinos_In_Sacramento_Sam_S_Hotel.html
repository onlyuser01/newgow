<p>Flutter Entertainment-owned PokerStars is one of the biggest cardrooms worldwide, and it’s also expanding rapidly into other verticals of the gambling experience, including casino and sports. Because of the brand interest in other realms of gaming, Push Gaming and PokerStars have negotiated a content partnership that will see the former’s casino games added to PokerStars’ portfolio, Push said in an email press statement.</p>
<p>Push Gaming will feature its entire portfolio of slot games and incorporate it with PokerStars brands in available markets where both companies can work together. Push already has a number of titles that the company knows will be an immediate success with PokerStars players, including Razor Shark, Fat, Mystery Mission – to the Moon, Jammin’ Jars, and Retro Tapes among others.</p>
<p>All integrations are carried out by Push Gaming which makes for a smooth integration with the platform, and both companies will stand to benefitfrom the tie-up, offering PokerStars the opportunity to bring innovative titles to its audiences and for Push Gaming to consolidate its presence with some of the top-tier operators out there.</p>
<p>PokerStars already packs an impressive player base that spans multiple segments, including poker, sports betting, and not least, poker with as many as 13 million players. Push Gaming itself has been able to launch with operators such as Svenska Spel, Sky bet, 888, 32red, LeoVegas, Betsson, and more, which exemplifies the supplier’s reputation and overall respect for the brand in the industry.</p>
<p>There has been a significant uptick in overall business operations this year, says Push Gaming Director of New Business and Markets Fiona Hickey, and she is confident that this will continue into 2023. "This agreement with Pokerstars [sic] is another huge step forward for us. It’s a clear sign that the industry’s key players recognize the quality we have in content creation," she concluded.</p>
<p>Casino Guru News previously spoke with Hickey who outlined the company’s overall strategy which focuses on rapid expansion in regulated markets and with leading operators and companies. Push Gaming has been able to enter a number of important jurisdictions over the past months, including Switzerland at the beginning of the year. Push Gaming also secured a content partnership with MrQ in the United Kingdom in November.</p>
