    <h1>Casino Bristol Hotels In Lake Charles With Casinos Royal Ace Casino 100 Free Spins Casino Royal Cari</h1>

<p>Dear wuhu93,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I only assume that if you do not wish to receive any further promotional offers from the casino, you also wish to close your account. Either way, I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>You may choose to self-exclude yourself by contacting our Customer Support.</p>
<p>Please note that self-exclusion is available for the following periods:</p>
<p>• 1 month</p>
<p>• 3 months</p>
<p>• 6 months</p>
<p>You may determine your deposit limits based on a maximum daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit. A request to decrease an existing deposit limit will be put into effect immediately. Requests to increase existing deposit limits will be put into effect 24 hours after the relevant request has been made.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Sultanbet Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@sultanbet.com (you can CC me petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments.</p>
<p>You can request to have your account blocked or not receive any promotional offers. It entirely depends on you.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
