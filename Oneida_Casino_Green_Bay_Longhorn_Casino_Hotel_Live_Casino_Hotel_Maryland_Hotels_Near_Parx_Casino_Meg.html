<p>As the Ontario iGaming and betting market prepares to open the sluicegates for private operators on April 4, 2022, some suppliers and gaming brands have been vying for a license by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario. The latest to obtain the coveted permit is Bragg Gaming Group, which will be among the first suppliers to deliver on a range of experiences in the new iGaming jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Poised to Enter Ontario and Launch Products</p>
<p>A license by the AGCO effectively allows Bragg Gaming Group to start distributing its quality product and other casino solutions to the market and power up the experience for new entrants in the market. Bragg will be effectively delivering both its iGaming and sports betting operations in the market along with its player account management (PAM) platform, managed services, and distinct gaming content.</p>
<p>Bragg is also confident that it will be able to fulfill all regulatory compliance measures across the board and deliver on the necessary prerequisites to secure a strong foothold for its future and existing partners in the highly-promising market in Ontario. The new online gaming regime will allow private operators to join the market for the first time starting next month, opening up the potential of what could be the biggest iGaming market in North America.</p>
<p>So far, Ontario’s state-owned operations are the only ones that allow iGaming and sports betting, but this is about to rapidly change. Bragg is confident that it has plenty to offer as well through its dedicated portfolio of in-house studios and exclusive content from third-party partners that are distributed through its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Put together, H2 Gambling Capital, a gambling research and data company, estimates the potential of Ontario to be anywhere around $2 billion for both its iGaming and sports betting market.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Confident about the Future</p>
<p>This makes Ontario a coveted market for a number of brands. Commenting on this opportunity, Bragg CCO Chris Looney welcomed the opportunity and highlighted its significance for the company:</p>
<p>“This license is another milestone achievement for Bragg. Hot on the heels of our recent launches in the UK, which has similar regulatory standards to Ontario, and the Netherlands, where we successfully launched local partner brands on our PAM, as well as content and aggregation products, we are now fully ready to support our Canadian partners as the market prepares to open up.” Bragg CCO Chris Looney</p>
<p>His comments come in the broader context of more companies expressing their readiness to join the Ontario gaming market. Among those brands are 888 Holdings, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, and PokerStars to name a few. Looney is confident that Ontario will be a second home to the company and it will benefit from its untapped iGaming and betting potential.</p>
<p>Receiving this supplier license in Ontario will allow the company to prepare in the weeks ahead about the official launch that will follow. Bragg is interested in the Ontario and North American market as a whole and it already operates in different international jurisdictions.</p>
