<p>By extending their collaboration, the popular betting and gaming brand will continue to benefit from GiG's automated affiliate marketing compliance tool, GiG Comply</p>
<p>The provider of award-winning solutions catering to the betting and online gambling sector, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced it extended its partnership with Gauselmann Group’s leading online gambling brand, Merkur. Details regarding the new collaboration emerged Tuesday and see GiG continue to supply the popular brand with GiG Comply, its leading automated affiliate marketing compliance tool.</p>
<p>GiG’s innovative solution helps operators ensure their compliance within different jurisdictions. This is achieved by scanning web pages for content, including code red words for iGaming and regulatory compliance. The automated process, completed by GiG Comply, helps by analyzing data and providing reports for affiliates’ promotional campaigns and grants operators with reports. Ultimately, the solution helps operators set up specific market requirements for different jurisdictions and ensure their marketing communication complies with the established local regulations.</p>
<p>Martin Collins, Merkur’s affiliate lead, revealed that the company is delighted to continue its successful collaboration with GiG. He highlighted the importance of compliance, especially for the regulated gambling market in Germany and acknowledged the extensive experience and knowledge within compliance that GiG has. Finally, Collins added: “Protection of our brands is of the highest importance and this tool really helps us focus on what is needed to move forward.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to continue growing our business with the trusted help of GIG who bring to the table a wealth of knowledge making this partnership easy and enjoyable.“ Martin Collins, affiliate lead at Merkur</p>
<p>GiG Highlights the Importance of Compliance</p>
<p>The recent partnership with Merkur comes after GiG confirmed it signed a new platform deal with Mooir eGaming Limited, a fast-growing online gambling brand. Announced earlier this month, the collaboration saw the brand tap into GiG’s multi-award-winning casino platform and solutions.</p>
<p>Jonas Warrer, GiG’s chief marketing officer, explained that while the gambling regulations continue to evolve, compliance with the established rules is paramount for operators within the gambling sector. Last but not least, he pointed out: “The need for operators to protect their brand is at a critical stage in the evolution of the industry, and we’re delighted to be trusted by so many big players to look after such a pivotal function.”</p>
<p>“Compliance is proving to be a hot topic of conversation, not just in Germany but globally, as we start to see the maturing of regulation.“ Jonas Warrer, chief marketing officer at GiG</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GiG posted an all-time high Q2 revenue. At the time of the announcement, the company revealed that its second quarter of 2023 revenue hit $33.9 million, marking a significant 40% increase year-over-year. Besides revenue, adjusted EBITDA for the period soared, hitting $15.3 million, up by 68% when compared to the corresponding period last year.</p>
