    <h1>San Manuel Casino San Bernardino California Oklahoma Casinos Near Me Casino Memes Directions To Myst</h1>

<p>Billing and payments company PayNearMe has released its newest iGaming-focused money movement management platform. Named MoneyLine, the new platform has been designed with all the intricacies of the iGaming ecosystem in mind.</p>
<p>MoneyLine Helps Operators Manage Payments</p>
<p>PayNearMe describes MoneyLine as an end-to-end iGaming payments experience management solution. The company’s new platform offers faster payouts, cashiering, frictionless deposits, and cash at cage solutions. MoneyLine will also give operators important insights that can help them to improve their products reach, add more people and turn most of them into loyal clients.</p>
<p>PlayNearMe’s chief revenue officer and general manager, Michael Kaplan, spoke on the platform’s launch. He started by pointing out that deposits and payouts are of utmost importance to operators as they provide crucial touchpoints with their customers. Kaplan insists that friction at these touchpoints leads to distrust, which causes players to drop off and that, in turn, damages the business.</p>
<p>“MoneyLine removes the friction, enabling operators to give players what they want — easy, fast deposit and payout experiences,” Kaplan stated.</p>
<p>MoneyLine is the peak of PayNearMe’s tech solutions and is a result of the company’s experience, knowledge of the iGaming industry, and thirst for innovation. Thanks to it, many operators will be able to better manage their finance, cut costs and improve client experience all at the same time.</p>
<p>PayNearMe’s Renown has Already Gotten MoneyLine New Clients</p>
<p>Despite being just launched, MoneyLine already has found some notable clients. One of them is the PlayLive! online casino – a gambling platform related to the Philadelphia-based</p>
<p>Live! Casinos &amp; Hotels and Pittsburgh. Thanks to MoneyLine’s solution, PlayLive! will simplify deposits and payout experiences for its customers in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Joe Billhimer, the executive VP of Cordish Gaming Group, a division of PlayLive.com’s ownership group The Cordish Companies, spoke about the decision to use MoneyLine. He emphasized the complexity of managing deposits and payouts and the need of having dedicated technology. Billhimer believes MoneyLine is the answer to those needs. He is pleased to partner with a company with such a vast experience in payments and iGaming.</p>
<p>“We were looking for an all-in-one solution and found that PayNearMe’s MoneyLine gives us the flexibility and agility we need, along with the widest range of payment types, all on a single platform,” Billhimer concluded.</p>
<p>PayNearMe became involved with iGaming in 2013. Since then, it has worked for the benefit of the iGaming market and has grown to reach 15 different states in the USA. The payment processing company was recently approved for operations on Arizona’s fresh betting market alongside the Barstool Sportsbook.</p>
<p>PayNearMe’s offerings are critically acclaimed as it serves nine out of ten of the United States’ largest betting operators and 16 of the 17 largest online casinos in the country.</p>
