<p>Hollywoodbets is doubling down on its commitment to ensure that players are protected and that no compromising revenue streams are interfering with business</p>
<p>To this end, the company has established a new alliance with ClearStake, a company that focuses on simple and affordable consumer checks that allow for fast and frictionless onboarding of players and ensure that users are protected – but also not lost to laborious prerequisites before joining the website.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets Brings More Expertise to Strengthen Consumer Protection</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets believes that this partnership with ClearStake gives it another level of depth of the experience, helping it elevate consumer standards across the board and protect vulnerable individuals. Thanks to ClearStake, players who need to submit any relevant financial data can do so in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>This way, Hollywoodbets’ team can handle affordability and source of funds checks at a faster but more robust and secure pace. Commenting on the new partnership opportunity with Hollywoodbets, ClearStake CEO Martin Burt said:</p>
<p>ClearStake has one mission – to support gambling companies in protecting customers while losing as few of them as possible.</p>
<p>Burt spoke of the importance of making sure that high player protection is at the core of everything his company does. ClearStake uses advanced tech that allows it to sift through all necessary aspects of a financial check and use legitimate, reliable, and lightning-fast mechanisms to verify everything that regulators, businesses, and players need and care for.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be helping Hollywoodbets to change the face of compliance,” Burt said. Hollywoodbets compliance manager Tyla Labuschagne was similarly pleased to have this opportunity and see this partnership take off. She welcomed it as a pleasure to be working with ClearStake and ensure that everything that customers need will be delivered in a safe and quick manner.</p>
<p>Rapid Checks Lead to a Boost in Conversion Rates</p>
<p>“The platform is easy to use and any changes we request are promptly implemented,” she said. Labuschagne confirmed that Hollywoodbets’ conversion ratio has increased substantially, pointing to two things – one that players are indeed reluctant to go through lengthy financial checks and two – there are robust solutions available to facilitate this process and make it much easier.</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets has been actively strengthening its footprint on a global scale through the addition of new studio partners. The company has recently teamed up with Twain Sport and Pragmatic Play.</p>
