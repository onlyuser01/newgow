<p>The gambling therapy charity, the Gordon Moody Association, announced details regarding the world's first residential gambling addiction treatment center for women in the UK late in 2020. At the time, the charity confirmed that the number of women suffering from gambling addiction in the UK "is at an all-time high," which is why, a new treatment center was developed that would provide extensive support and treatment services.</p>
<p>The treatment center, located in a terraced house in central Birmingham, opened its doors in 2021 and has been providing vital support and treatment for women, who have felt the devastating impact of problem gambling. Although the usual treatment for gambling addiction in men takes about 14 weeks, the period for women is shortened to five weeks. This is primarily because most women have children.</p>
<p>A new report released by the BBC, reveals the positive impact of the Gordon Moody residential gambling treatment center for women. In fact, the outlet marks the first media allowed in the center since it opened its doors back in 2021. After only a few years, the center has made a significant positive impact and helped many women who are in need of support and treatment.</p>
<p>Participants in the treatment program of the residential gambling addiction center engage in different educational sessions, workshops and undergo daily therapy over a five-week program. During that time, the women are encouraged to share how they feel and participate in discussions. To ensure that the visitors aren't going to engage in any gambling activities, throughout their stay, they have limited access to money, online services or smartphones.</p>
<p>According to Harp Edwards, the center's manager, women that engage in the program are the ones that need treatment the most as there is a risk of them attempting to take their own life or harming themselves. She explained: "They feel like it's the last straw for them, so coming into treatment is kind of like their last option."</p>
<p>In addition to workshops and therapy sessions, the program seeks to relieve the women from the daily stress they experience. Edwards said: "So all the stresses of the outside world are kind of gone." Additionally, the center's manager noted: "I think the importance of having a female-only treatment is that it allows a woman to be in a safe space and focus on women-only issues as well."</p>
<p>The treatment center helped many women and will continue its noble mission. Although currently, the residential women-only treatment center can only take five women at a time, this will soon change. Its current location is labeled as temporary and a bigger and permanent location for the center is planned in Wolverhampton. Undoubtedly, the new facility will continue the important work and provide vital support for women that need it most.</p>
