<p>Ahead of the new season, the duo renewed their content partnership with the delivery of a fully managed content hub developed by SSG</p>
<p>The leading technology, content and media company focusing on sports betting, Spotlight Sports Group (SSG), announced it renewed its content partnership with Sky Betting and Gaming. On Monday, the company revealed it has built a fully managed soccer content hub for Sky Betting and Gaming. The new content hub, SSG said, will support the annual Fan Hope survey.</p>
<p>The latest hub complements a previous successful collaboration between the duo. This year’s hub will grant sports fans a chance to reveal what they think about their favorite soccer team. Passionate sports fans and bettors alike will have the option to agree or disagree with important topics and soccer stories.</p>
<p>One of the major advantages of this year’s content hub is the option that allows users to select league winners within the English Football League (EFL) and English Premier League (EPL). Once a user has made their selection, they can add them directly into a bet slip. Then, users can share this data on social media such as Twitter by using a personalized graphic.</p>
<p>According to SSG, the new content hub will be launched in two phases. With the first phase going live in mid-July, the second one is planned following the first international break for the season. SSG explained that the dual-phase delivery of the hub is done to “keep the content and user experience fresh throughout the season.”</p>
<p>Recently, the leading tech, media and content company that delivers thrilling betting experiences signed an agreement with FTN Network. Announced back in June, the collaboration saw FTN Network tap into solutions and technology supplied by SSG.</p>
<p>Renewed Agreement Brings Excitement</p>
<p>Barney Wilcock, Sky Betting and Gaming’s senior content strategy manager, explained that the hub from last year enabled the company to engage and retain audiences from the start of the football season through the World Cup. He said that Sky anticipates the same positive effect to be observed for the 2023/2024 season. “We know our users love interacting with the content hub and SSG has yet again gone above and beyond to deliver an excellent customer experience,” explained Wilcock in conclusion.</p>
<p>While the collaboration between the duo dating back to last year was undoubtedly a successful one, the new content hub is expected to further elevate the experiences for sports fans.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted that Sky Betting and Gaming has once again trusted our team to bring their annual Fan Hope survey to life through our industry-leading content hubs.“ Daniel Smith, head of UK and Ireland B2B sales at SSG</p>
<p>Daniel Smith, SSG’s head of UK and Ireland B2B sales, added that the company is excited to join forces with Sky once again and support their Fan Hope survey. Speaking about the content hub from last year, he said that it helped deliver unique experiences. Now, Smith said that SSG hopes that this year’s content hub will further improve the experiences for sports fans. Finally, he said that he is looking forward to seeing how Sky’s audiences will accept the new hub.</p>
