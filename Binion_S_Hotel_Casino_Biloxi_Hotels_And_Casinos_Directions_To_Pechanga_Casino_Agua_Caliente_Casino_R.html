    <h1>Binion S Hotel Casino Biloxi Hotels And Casinos Directions To Pechanga Casino Agua Caliente Casino R</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play, a leading gaming content provider, has partnered with Novibet to launch its Live Casino service in a number of controlled markets, including Greece and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play and Novibet Struck a Deal</p>
<p>Customers of Novibet will now have access to Pragmatic Play’s exciting live casino games, including the iconic Blackjack Azure and the revolutionary Mega Roulette and Mega Wheel goods, which add massive multipliers to every spin for increased win potential.</p>
<p>Novibet’s users will broaden their playing preferences even more by having access to unique items that combine fun-filled action with a nostalgic, TV-like style, promoting the supplier’s offering cross-sell potential.</p>
<p>Vice president of commercial strategy and operations at Pragmatic Play, Bhotesh Maheshwari, said: “Our Live Casino offering continues to grow in popularity, and we’re delighted to take our games live across Novibet’s brands in regulated markets.”</p>
<p>Maheshwari added that in this vertical, Pragmatic Play has seen tremendous progress, and the company is happy to bring Novibet as a valued partner.</p>
<p>Fotini Matthaiou, casino manager at Novibet, stated that Novibet is very excited to realize this collaboration with Pragmatic Play, which has a well-deserved reputation as a leading multi-product provider.</p>
<p>Matthaiou continued by stating that Novibet is looking forward to a solid future partnership with Pragmatic Play, whose exciting live casino games open up new opportunities for Novibet’s players to enjoy their iGaming experiences.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play’s Exciting Portfolio</p>
<p>Last month, Pragmatic Play introduced Juicy Fruits, a new fruit slot game with a special Ante Bet and up to 18 re-triggerable free spins, which would appeal to traditional slot fans.</p>
<p>This 5-by-5-grid game has a high level of volatility and 50 paylines, which increases the odds of winning even more.</p>
<p>Pragmatic has decided to improve on the standard multiplayer experience by adding a slew of bonus content and ramping up the fun factor.</p>
<p>The fruits themselves are all present. Cherry, lemon, apricot, strawberry, raspberry, kiwi, watermelon, and other low-paying fruits are available to give you the retro feel and nostalgic gameplay. The twist is that a five-of-a-kind payline with the Lucky 7 symbol will result in a 24x multiplier.</p>
<p>Another exciting game from Pragmatic came last year. John Hunter returned, armed with a whip and ready to face down ancient empires in search of fortune, glory, and the joy of finishing yet another perilous adventure.</p>
<p>John Hunter and the Mayan Gods is the latest installment in Pragmatic Play’s famous iGaming sequence.</p>
<p>The Book of Tut, The Tomb of the Scarab Queen, Aztec Treasure, and Da Vinci’s Treasure are only a few of the franchise’s several chapters, which together make up a sizable portfolio of adventure-themed treasure hunt games.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play currently releases up to five new slot titles every month, in addition to Live Casino and Bingo games, all of which are accessible via a single API.</p>
