<p>As iGaming grows, Hacksaw Gaming remains perfectly positioned to expand across Europe and beyond</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading developer of premium iGaming titles, has penetrated into Bulgaria’s online gambling market thanks to a distribution deal with Inbet. As per the agreement, Hacksaw Gaming will supply the local operator with some of its best casino games.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, a selection of Hacksaw Gaming’s cutting-edge slots will be integrated into Inbet’s casino offering. As a result, Bulgarian players will get to play Hacksaw Gaming’s signature Wanted Dead or a Wild slot. In addition to that, players will be able to try out some of Hacksaw Haming’s latest releases, including R.I.P. City, Chaos Crew, Stack’em, Cubes 2 and Joker Bombs, among others.</p>
<p>The foray into Bulgaria represents another opportunity for Hacksaw Gaming, which remains bullish on expanding its international footprint. The company continues to solidify itself as a best-in-class provider thanks to multiple agreements with leading operators in regulated markets.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Hacksaw Gaming continued its US push, launching content in West Virginia through its agreement with DraftKings. Earlier this month, Hacksaw also integrated content into REEVO, helping it move closer to its goal of 60+ partnerships for 2023.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming Is Excited to Grow Its International Presence</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s chief executive officer, Marcus Cordes, commented on the agreement, expressing his excitement to enter the Bulgarian market following launches in the United States and Lithuania.</p>
<p>Cordes added:</p>
<p>As iGaming grows apace across the world, we remain perfectly positioned to embark on continued expansion across Europe and further afield driven by mutually beneficial partnerships. Marcus Cordes, CEO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Tihomir Dyakov, inbet.com’s chief operating officer, also commented on the agreement. He pointed out that Inbet is currently one of the biggest and fastest-growing betting and gaming operators in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>According to Dyakov, his team seeks to support Inbet’s growth by adding content from renowned providers.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to continue our great results in the first year of our market entry, and we believe that our partnership with Hacksaw will help us with that. Tihomir Dyakov, COO, inbet.com</p>
<p>Prior to the partnership agreement with Hacksaw Gaming, Inbet also onboarded content from Yggdrasil, a leading provider of online casino content. Launching a rich selection of titles with the operator, Yggdrasil was also able to expand its presence in the Balkans by inking a partnership agreement with the operator.</p>
<p>Last year, Inbet also added content from 7777 gaming and Playson.</p>
