<p>Hard Rock security officers and local EMTs tried to resuscitate the 30-year-old Rochester, N.Y. man. Despite their repeated efforts, he was pronounced dead at the resort casino located on the Boardwalk.</p>
<p>It is not clear from police reports if the man fell into the lobby of the hotel or the lobby of the gaming floor. Police reports did not specify how far a distance it is between the second floor and the lobby floor.</p>
<p>Police Look for Details</p>
<p>An initial inquiry revealed the man was trying to climb over a divider on the resort casino’s second floor when he fell at about 4 am, according to an Atlantic City police statement. Supplemental police reports and autopsy will provide additional information on the cause of the fall.</p>
<p>Atlantic City police were notified immediately about the incident and continued the investigation until Monday evening. Police likely are looking for witnesses who might have seen the incident or saw the man before the fall.</p>
<p>The man’s name was not made public as of Monday. Nor were details available on the man’s condition before the fall.</p>
<p>Casino.org reached out to the Hard Rock for additional details, but did not hear back before publication. It was not clear if the incident led to any disruption of hotel or casino operations.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Atlantic City opened in June of 2018. The casino quickly became one of the highest casino revenue generators. Through July, Hard Rock saw land-based gross gaming revenue (GGR) of $80.2 million. That ranked the property No. 3 in Atlantic City, behind only Borgata ($140 million) and Harrah’s $80.9 million.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Casino Scene of Other Fatal Falls</p>
<p>Monday’s fatal fall is not the first for a US casino. For instance, in 1996, a woman fell to her death from the 26th floor of Las Vegas’ Luxor Resort and Casino.</p>
<p>A man also fell to his death from the 10th floor of the same hotel, according to the Las Vegas Ghosts website, a site that provides tours for visitors.</p>
<p>Falling from a height is the third-highest cause of fatal injuries to employees of any type of business at 20 percent, according to Modern Restaurant Management, a trade publication. That type of fall is the fourth-most common cause of non-fatal work accidents.</p>
