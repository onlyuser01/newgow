    <h1>Casinos In Oklahoma With Hotels Casino Scorsese Party Casino Us Casinos Online Casino In Stl Mo Luck</h1>

<p>I have been depositing on this casino for months. Verified immediately. I requested a cashout on the 14th of Oct and was told I had to re-verify. That was okay. 16th Oct withdrawal approved and then processed. Time frame as stated by them on the email was 3-5 banking days. I contacted them again on the 24th Oct via email, as the 'banking days' had since passed. Their response:</p>
<p>"We have reviewed your last inquiry and we would like to inform you that your withdrawal request was processed on 15/10/2020, however unfortunately there is an issue with Wire Cards which is on the bank side, once it has been solved you will be informed via email, we apologize for the inconveniences caused, thanks for your patience and understanding."</p>
<p>29th Oct I contact them again via email, as Ive had no updates and send in my past 30 days bank statement to show I have not received funds. Their response:</p>
<p>"Kindly note that withdraws are stuck on intermediary banks for all players due to the current situation, however, we received information that this should be solved shortly and as soon as the funds are released you will receive it."</p>
<p>4th Nov I contact them via live chat and am asked to wait until Friday to see if I get any funds. That will then be 15 business days and 21 days total. Now had they have been the ones to update me every few days I would be fine. But for me to chase it up is ridiculous. Would not recommend them to anyone.</p>
