<p>Just before the launch of the sports betting market in Ohio, the gambling regulator in the state warned that one operator may be facing a fine over alleged breaches of marketing rules</p>
<p>On Friday, the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC), the regulatory body in charge of gambling activities in the state, announced that it plans to take administrative action against DraftKings.</p>
<p>DraftKings May Be Subject to a $350K Fine</p>
<p>The regulator claimed that the sports betting operator breached the state’s sports gaming advertising rules. A statement released by the OCCC alleged that DraftKings completed an advertising campaign back in November. During the campaign, the regulator claimed that the operator sent advertising materials to approximately 2,500 recipients under the age of 21. The gambling watchdog reiterated that under the current regulations, it is prohibited for sports betting operators to target or advertise to individuals under 21.</p>
<p>The OCCC urged DraftKings to establish procedures that ensure no advertising content is distributed to individuals with age that is not verified. Besides those new procedures, the regulator did not rule out the possibility of imposing a $350,000 fine against the operator. As with any allegation for breaches, the operator is given the right to a hearing. What’s more, the Ohio gambling regulator said that it will determine what action to take against DraftKings following a public meeting. If indeed the OCCC imposes a fine, the funds would then be redirected to the state’s Sports Gaming Revenue Fund.</p>
<p>The Gambling Watchdog Is Disappointed to See Breaches</p>
<p>Matthew Schuler, the OCCC’s executive director, commented in a statement outlining that the Commission has established clear rules about the advertising of sports gaming. At the same time, he said that the OCCC is disappointed to see breaches of the rules. “While we do not take administrative action lightly, DraftKings’ conduct in this case warrants the Commission’s intervention to ensure the integrity of sports gaming,” said Schuler in conclusion.</p>
<p>“The Commission has been very clear about the rules and standards for sports gaming advertising with the industry and are disappointed with the lack of compliance we have seen despite the reminders.“ Matthew Schuler, executive director at the Ohio Casino Control Commission</p>
<p>DraftKings was among the major players in the industry that launched their services in Ohio on Sunday, which marked the start of the regulated sports betting market in the state. In addition to DraftKings, other operators such as FanDuel, Caesars and BetMGM, among other major players have also introduced their services in Ohio.</p>
