<p>The global gaming leader, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a new groundbreaking collaboration with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG). The company said Tuesday its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, was selected as OLG's partner for a long-term collaboration.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, IGT was designated as the primary technology provider of self-serve lottery terminals for OLG. The recent landmark agreement will mark the debut of self-serve technology for OLG players.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by IGT, the new deal will be valid through June 2027. However, the total duration of the contract can be extended by additional 10 years under one-year contract extension possibilities. This means that if the duo completes the whole contract, IGT will be the provider of self-serve lottery terminals in Ontario for the next 15 years.</p>
<p>The leading gaming company announced that installation of the terminals within retail locations is expected to be completed during the second half of next year. However, it's important to mention that the introduction of those terminals is still subject to relevant government approvals.</p>
<p>Overall, IGT is expected to provide OLG with some 1,400 GameTouch 28 self-serve lottery terminals. To develop and design the self-serving terminals, IGT leveraged its three-decade experience in offering advanced iGaming self-serve solutions. During the term of the lengthy contract with OLG, IGT may provide additional self-serve technology such as its Game Touch Draw terminals.</p>
<p>The company revealed that the terminals feature responsible gaming functionality. What's more, IGT's self-serving terminals comply with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Being AODA compliant means that the machines will offer features that include an audio jack and pin pad which will help with accessibility for all lottery players.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement about the recent deal, OLG's President and CEO, Duncan Hannay, said: "As OLG embarks on the next evolution of lottery play in Ontario, we will work with key partners like IGT to deliver responsible, secure and convenient access to player-favorite lottery games." He explained that the launch of the new self-serve lottery technology in Ontario will allow OLG to "continue to drive sales and maximize revenue for provincial priorities for the benefit of the people of Ontario."</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT's Chief Operating Officer, Global Lottery, added that the company is excited to join forces with OLG. He outlined that the collaboration enhances responsibly the gambling experience for players in Ontario while at the same time introducing the new self-serving terminals.</p>
<p>Gendron added: "As the largest lottery in Canada, OLG consistently leads the charge in modernizing the player journey for its customers." He said that IGT's self-serving technology will offer functionality, new experiences and convenience for OLG customers. In conclusion, Gendron said that the collaboration complements OLG's innovation goals.</p>
