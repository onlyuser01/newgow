    <h1>Online Casino Canada Directions To Mystic Lake Casino Casinos In Tunica Borgata Online Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Nick,</p>
<p>I am not sure that you are anywhere close to the issue that was raised.</p>
<p>Let me try to bring you back to the original issue that was raised and about which all the details were provided here on the blog and also privately via email.</p>
<p>The issue is that casino claims that they do withdrawals instantly i.e. within 15 mins they are completed. Yet in my case, it was seen not once but twice they failed to deliver. Not only that, they committed new timeline of 2 hours first and then 24 hours and had no update the next day.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they cancelled the withdrawal and returned money to my wallet and mentioned the reason as "cancelled by the user", when there was no such option available even, upon discussion with customer care, they said it was a technical issue and asked to retry.</p>
<p>Another attempt for withdrawal was made and then yet again, it wasn't completed and returned back to casino account.</p>
<p>I eventually used that money to play with and lost, I guess that is what they wanted players to do and so that money is never paid out.</p>
<p>This was annoying and I decided to never play with them, I asked them to close my account, for which they said they can only put a temporary hold on account, there is no way to close account. I asked them to refer the self exclusion policy, and they said ok we shall take request.</p>
<p>I considered that as the final confirmation, yet they never closed the account. Their marketing team kept calling. Everytime new person, finally after a lot of their convincing I have them another chance and agreed to do another deposit and they said my account was always active and wasn't closed and promised me they will ensure instant withdrawals and will assist via WhatsApp/calls via a VIP manager. I somehow won big that day and upon registering the withdrawal request, everyone vanished, nobody answered on WhatsApp, customer care had same script on chat, sir it will take 2 hours, then 24 hours</p>
<p>The point is they are FAKE and they do not process withdrawals, I have stopped playing with them long back and posted here my complete experience so others don't fall in their trap, considering there are better choices available elsewhere. This website is useless and this casino should never be trusted.</p>
<p>Infact asking multiple times to their people and sharing the ugly experience I have had with them, now again new marketing people from their team calling and trying to convince by saying, "Sir, we are sorry for your experience please give us one more time".</p>
<p>Mistakes can happen once, but if they're repeated then it's intentionally done, like in their case. Hence, no further chance for them. There doesn't seem to be a regulated entity to take action about the loss I have faced. But my key intention of sharing via your forum is for others to be saved.</p>
