<p>The latest trading update reveals that Churchill Downs' results received a boost from the lifting of COVID-related restrictions as well as strategic acquisitions</p>
<p>Overall, the net revenue reported by Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) for the year ended December 31, 2022, hit $1.81 billion, a new record for the company. This result, when compared to the $1.6 billion figure reported in 2021, marked an increase of 13%.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the net income reported by CDI in 2022 increased as well. The company hit a record net income of $439.4 million in 2022. When compared to the $249.1 million reported for the prior year period, the result from 2022 marked an increase of 76%. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA in 2022 also set a record hitting $763.6 million. When compared to the $627 million result reported in 2021, the latest result reveals that adjusted EBITDA grew by 22%.</p>
<p>A breakdown provided by CDI revealed that in 2022, the revenue from live and historical racing increased significantly. Back in 2021, the net revenue from that segment halted at $409.1 million, while in 2022, soared to $614.6 million. The net revenue from gaming also increased hitting $755.9, up from the $695.4 million result from 2021.</p>
<p>In contrast to the increase, the net revenue from TwinSpires decreased by nearly 4% to $436.4 million. The revenue reported from other operations also decreased, halting at $2.9 million.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that CDI acknowledged that the lifting of COVID-related restrictions impacted positively the company’s performance. In fact, it said that the 2022 Kentucky Derby was held without the restrictions that were in place the previous year.</p>
<p>CDI Highlights Multiple Achievements, Posts Strong Q4 Revenue</p>
<p>Besides its full year 2022 results, CDI acknowledged multiple strategic achievements completed during the period. Back in November, the company closed the acquisition of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment LLC in a deal with a $2.75 billion price tag.</p>
<p>Before that, back in September, CDI completed the acquisition of Chasers Poker Room located in Salem, New Hampshire. This strategic move boosted the company’s plan for further expansion.</p>
<p>Again in September, CDI closed the takeover of Ellis Park Racing and Gaming. The acquisition included rights for a new historic racing machine (HRM) entertainment venue in Owensboro, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2022, CDI closed the sale of Calder land in June, while in February, it closed the sale of its Arlington Heights, Illinois property in a deal of nearly $200 million to the Chicago Bears.</p>
<p>In addition to its 2022 revenue, CDI released data regarding its performance for the fourth quarter. In Q4, 2022, the company reported net revenue of $480.1 million, marking a strong growth when compared to the corresponding period in 2021 when the revenue halted at $364.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew in Q4, 2022 as well, hitting $180.7 million.</p>
