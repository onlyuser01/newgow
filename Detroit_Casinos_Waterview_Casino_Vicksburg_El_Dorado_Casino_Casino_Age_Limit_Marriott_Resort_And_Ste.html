<p>This latest executive reshuffle marks another milestone in the iGaming provider’s focus on empowering its North American growth and achieving lasting success</p>
<p>Leading B2B technology provider EveryMatrix has announced the appointment of Bobby Longhurst as its new Group chief commercial officer (CCO). Longhurst brings a wealth of experience to the role and replaces Stian Hornsletten, who will move to the position of chief executive officer of the Games division at the start of next month.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Continues Investing in Top Talent</p>
<p>The company’s latest announcement is part of ongoing changes to EveryMatrix’s executive team. Bobby Longhurst will assume the responsibilities of Group CCO, stepping into co-founder Stian Hornsletten’s shoes. Adding to the executive reshuffle, Nikolina Gabelica was appointed head of lottery two days before Longhurst’s announcement, further bolstering the company’s leadership.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Group CEO Ebbe Groes expressed his confidence in the new appointment, noting that attracting leading industry talent would pay significant long-term dividends. He lauded Longhurst’s expertise, hoping the new CCO would contribute to the company’s sustained growth. The leading supplier maintains impressive momentum and should benefit from a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Bobby’s… extensive commercial, product, and strategic experience will provide us with even greater firepower to expand our reach across new and existing verticals. Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix Group CEO</p>
<p>The B2B provider’s impressive Q3 2023 results mean that Longhurst’s new position as CCO will be dynamic and challenging as the company prioritizes its North American expansion. EveryMatrix recently announced a new partnership with gaming giant Caesars Entertainment, agreeing to supply its content for Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino and Caesars Palace Online Casino.</p>
<p>Longhurst Is Well-Prepared to Excel in His New Position</p>
<p>Bobby Longhurst enters EveryMatrix with an extensive background, accumulating over 15 years of experience in various roles. His professional journey includes a three-year stint at venture capital firm Mindhub Capital as director of business intelligence. Longhurst also served as the Owner &amp; CEO of Farrell Longhurst, his human capital acquisition company, for more than seven and a half years.</p>
<p>The new CCO’s foray into the gambling sector began in January 2017 as he joined B2B trading and pricing service provider Sporting Solutions. He quickly became a leading industry expert, making his new role a natural next step in his career. Longhurst was keen to join EveryMatrix, hoping to help the company capitalize on its ongoing growth.</p>
<p>There are huge opportunities on the horizon across all our major business units and products following the success the business has had in recent years. Bobby Longhurst, EveryMatrix CCO</p>
<p>The recent series of strategic appointments and management reshuffles is part of EveryMatrix’s plan to strengthen its position in the dynamic and competitive iGaming landscape, leveraging the expertise and leadership of experienced professionals like Bobby Longhurst. The company hopes to maintain its impressive 2023 momentum and achieve even greater success in the new year.</p>
