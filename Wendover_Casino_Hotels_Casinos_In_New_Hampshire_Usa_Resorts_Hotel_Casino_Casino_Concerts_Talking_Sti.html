    <h1>Wendover Casino Hotels Casinos In New Hampshire Usa Resorts Hotel Casino Casino Concerts Talking Sti</h1>

<p>Hello MAtej, I sent all the documents you wanted several times, everyone in the casino wanted a different document, I did it too. Then there was a message that the player account will be blocked until January 15th, 2020 due to time-consuming processing. I looked at my player account, however It was not blocked, after which I asked again how far my processing is and why my account is not blocked, but I don't get an answer to my questions and requests. My daughter helped me and all documents again in PDF to be sent as requested, either it means that invoices are not accepted, or that it does not show all four corners of a bank letter, there are always other excuses. One chatt employee says in Sceenshot, the other one says no, then another says only photos, then another says everything in PDF. Everyone says what else he wants, the only employee who has a fair view k had it was Kay, who said they only need the address confirmation, which I have sent in many different documents, and so far there is simply no response from the Hyperino or Wunderino. I did everything and let myself be shoved back and forth, but I guess the casino does not want to pay out. I saved the whole process with chatting and emailing and documents if you need it. Thank you for your help</p>
