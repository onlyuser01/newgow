    <h1>Bellagio Hotel And Casino Uptown Aces Casino Miccosukee Resort Casino Hollywood Casino Grantville Pa</h1>

<p>i have deposited and played with nine casino on various occasions over the last year or so. Yesterday I won and decided to cash out 1400 CHF. I live in England and my address on the account is my English address ( and upon requesting withdrawal I had to upload documents which were approved instantly so there my account is / was fully verified).</p>
<p>I can’t remember why but it says i selected Switzerland as my country when I signed up hence why my currency is CHF, but this should not be an issue as they fully verified my account prior to withdrawal.</p>
<p>ive since looked at their Ts &amp; Cs and it states that players from UK are not allowed to deposit or play real money games.. but they have allowed me to deposit and play real money games ( and verified my account) up until the point where I have withdrawn.</p>
<p>my Account was not closed immediately. My cashout was pending and said they were performing checks ( this is when I went and saw the terms and conditions and started to stress, but my account was verified so thought it would be fine.</p>
<p>today I have tried to log in and I am allowed to go onto their website and scroll through the Main home page but it won’t let me physically click log in, or click on live chat.</p>
<p>I presume they have closed my account / ip address and intend on keeping my winnings but surely I am due my funds after they LET me deposit, play and verify my account fully. I haven’t changed my details since but now I fear for the worst after they are ignoring my emails and messages on social media.</p>
<p>1400 is a huge amount of money to me I don’t understand how they could let me deposit but not withdraw?? Absolute scam!</p>
<p>I don’t know how to proceed as I highly doubt they will reply to an email ( and haven’t emailed me regarding my account which I would have thought they would if it was closed.</p>
<p>so please could anyone help to assist me in getting my account and winnings back and inform me of where I stand.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
