<p>Irish bookmaker BoyleSports’ foray into the Dutch gambling market will be supported by the iGaming solutions provider Aspire Global as the two have signed a strategic deal. The agreement will see the latter company allow BoyleSports to use its proprietary full turnkey platform solution and managed services.</p>
<p>Aspire Global to Provide BoyleSports With a Platform</p>
<p>As per the deal, Aspire Global will power BoyleSports’ eventual entry into the Netherlands by allowing the operator to use BtoBet, a sportsbook subsidiary of the former company. Through BtoBet, BoyleSports will gain access to Aspire’s full offering, including the PAM platform and a variety of sports betting solutions and casino titles.</p>
<p>BoyleSports will also benefit from Aspire Global’s managed services solution AspireEngage. Aspire will market BoyleSports’ offerings across the Netherland through fully localized advertisements and will strive to build a good image for the operator.</p>
<p>Lastly, Aspire Global will assist BoyleSports in staying compliant with the Dutch market and will provide it with integrated solutions with payment providers.</p>
<p>BoyleSports Believes Aspire is the Perfect Partner</p>
<p>Tsachi Maimon, the chief executive officer of Aspire Global, believes this new partnership attests to the quality of Aspire Global’s betting solutions. He said that the company’s whole team is beyond excited to support BoyleSports’ entry into the Dutch market and demonstrate the strength of Aspire’s iGaming solutions.</p>
<p>Maimon congratulated BoyleSports as one of the leading brands in the sector and is looking forward to working with its team.</p>
<p>Mark Kemp, the chief executive of BoyleSports, also commented on the deal. He revealed that his company started looking for a reliable partner from the moment it decided to target the Dutch market. According to Kemp, the operator sought someone who could provide it with a “future-proof, high-quality, turnkey solution.” Kemp said that Aspire Global is everything BoyleSports had wished for:</p>
<p>“We have in Aspire Global found the perfect partner who will support us with leading technology, exciting games, and all the localized player support we need. This will enable us to focus on the player experience and branding of our new business in the Netherlands.” BoyleSports CEO Mark Kemp</p>
<p>BoyleSports currently has licenses for operating in Gibraltar, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although the operator still doesn’t officially hold a Dutch license, it plans to file its application in the near future.</p>
<p>The company was recently titled the best Premier League betting destination for 2021 as it turned out that it offered the best odds among its competitors. The company likely seeks to replicate this success when it eventually enters the fresh Dutch market.</p>
