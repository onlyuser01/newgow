    <h1>Shazam Casino Coyote Casino Casino Del Sol Sunset Station Hotel Casino Southland Casino West Memphis</h1>

<p>Closed my account, made an withdraw on the 30th of November and the remaing 48 need to be refunded. I contact them litterly 10 times by mail. 25 times by chat and contacted all their licenses and everything litterly nothing changed. This is the first message and last message. I also know that when you close your account an withdraw can take longer. I had that in Kansino, BetnFlix, OneCasino and way more so i know how its works.</p>

<p>Hello Gino,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Please note that we have now contacted the relevant team and is waiting for feedback. As soon as we have an update, we will contact you via email. ''</p>
<p>i got most of the chat transcripts as proof as well.</p>
<p>But at this point i litterly can't do anything.</p>
<p>I want my money and their needs to come something that protects the player because i asked this in the last chat:</p>
<p>Gino: if you still dont pay me after2 months</p>
<p>a player litterly still can not do anything right?</p>
<p>Joseph:</p>
<p>For now, the only advise we can provide is to wait for an update regarding the pending withdrawal</p>
<p>Like i said played in a lot of casino's but to wait MORE than 17 days even after contacting their finance department or how they call i relevant department more than 11 times and STILL didn't do anything is way too rigged.</p>
