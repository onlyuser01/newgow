<p>EGT Digital to Showcase its Offerings to the Global Industry</p>
<p>EGT Digital’s portfolio lists a sportsbook, casino and lottery games, payment gateway, flexible bonus engine, and other third-party integrations. The company will present these offerings and will highlight their unique features. Most importantly, industry enthusiasts will get to take a peek at EGT Digital’s new X-Nave iGaming platform.</p>
<p>EGT Digital’s chief executive officer, Alexander Botov, shed more light on the company’s current mindset. He revealed that the bettors’ constant demand for innovations ushers a need for the operators to always satisfy those demands. This, in turn, leads to operators’ demands always changing to suit the market tendencies. Because of this, Botov said, “providers should always be one step ahead to face the new challenges of the industry”.</p>
<p>“With our 20 years of experience, the EGT group is well-prepared to respond to the latest tendencies in the market, and now we are ready to prove it again by showcasing our next-gen iGaming solutions at the Global Gaming Expo 2021,” Botov announced.</p>
<p>He added that EGT Digital is more than thrilled to take a part in this premier event for commercial and tribal gaming professionals. The company is looking forward to meeting colleagues, building new partnerships, and making meaningful connections.</p>
<p>Always a Step Ahead</p>
<p>EGT Digital is a part of the Euro Games Technology Group and is focused on servicing operators in regulated markets. The company provides its clients with the needed tech advantage to get the edge over their competitors. EGT Digital is dedicated to always keep its products ahead of their time through constant upgrades and innovation.</p>
<p>EGT Digital’s portfolio will be showcased during the Global Gaming Expo 2021 – the premier event for commercial and tribal gaming professionals. It is scheduled to begin on October 4 and will take place at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>No live Global Gaming Expo has been hosted since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis so this will be the perfect chance for industry specialists to catch up with their colleagues in these turbulent times. People who wish to attend in person will be subject to the event’s pandemic regulations, wear face masks and follow the other rules at the venue.</p>
<p>EGT Digital’s portfolio will be showcased at Stand 2452 where people will be able to see everything from its famed software features and solutions.</p>
