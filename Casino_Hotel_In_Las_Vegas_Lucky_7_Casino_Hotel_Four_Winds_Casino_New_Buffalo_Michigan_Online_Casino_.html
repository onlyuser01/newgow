<p>Inspired Entertainment Inc has struck a new partnership with the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association or MLBPAA. Under the terms of the multi-year contract, the company will be allowed to leverage the association’s intellectual property, such as and not limited to persona and likenesses, and name and brand, for commercial uses worldwide. Inspired will be able to bring MLBPAA players to life thanks to its Home Run Shoot Out digital contest that can be integrated with all of the company’s retail and digital clients.</p>
<p>Bringing the Best Baseball Players in Virtual Sports</p>
<p>Inspired focuses on creating compelling virtual sports products, and it has been able to provide what it described as the “most exciting two minutes in virtual racing” on the occasion of the Kentucky Derby, a Triple Crown race, back in 2020. Sports lockdown brought solid results for Inspired throughout 2020.</p>
<p>Inspired President and COO Brooks Pierce welcomed the partnership as an important stepping stone into a new sport that will allow the company to produce a number of entertainment products that will feature MLBPAA members’ intellectual property. He added:</p>
<p>“Fans will love cheering on their favorite superstar players of all time, creating a more passionate and competitive experience. We have had great success with our NFLA Legends of Football game, and we expect to raise the bar even higher with Home Run Shoot Out.” Inspired President and COO Brooks Pierce</p>
<p>Pierce is confident that the simulated game will prove an attractive product that would realistically allow some of baseball’s legends to go head-to-head with the best players of the newer generations, creating new opportunities for sports fans to enjoy baseball. All games will be played as a single match, but there will be knock-out tournaments to follow, as well as new baseball legends constantly added to the game.</p>
<p>Home Run Shoot Out will feature numerous baseball legends, including Reggie Jackson, Al Kaline, and Mike Schmidt, among others, who will all come together to compete in the simulated virtual home run competition. Consumers will be able to place a bet on the winning player or the total number of home runs scored, as well as correct scores and totals.</p>
<p>With over 8,600 members to pick from, there is plenty of talent that Inspired Entertainment may integrate with its product. MLBPAA president Brooks Robinson welcomed the addition of Inspired, describing it as a perfect fit. Thanks to the Home Run Shoot Out suite, MLBPAA legends will be able to continue growing their brands, Robinson argued.</p>
<p>Inspired Entertainment works with a number of established companies from the industry. It has a working agreement for virtual sports with the likes of Entain and DraftKings.</p>
