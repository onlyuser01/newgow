<p>One of the leading iGaming studios and developers of online casino content, RubyPlay, has teamed up with prominent company Salsa Technology to further boost its reach in regulated markets across the world, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release. The partnership focuses specifically on the Latin American region, where RubyPlay is keen to increase its positions.</p>
<p>This will now be made possible and much easier with Salsa Gator, the partner’s namesake and proprietary aggregation platform that will onboard RubyPlay content and distribute it in the region. RubyPlay has plenty to offer locally, which is precisely why the company has been enjoying a strong pull with aggregators, operators, and players over the past months.</p>
<p>Previously, RubyPlay signed a similar aggregation partnership with SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator in a bid to strengthen its geographical reach, which it did. Stepping into Latin America with Salsa Gator would allow the supplier to introduce games such as Zeus Rush Fever Deluxe, Diamond Explosion 7s and Mayan Cache, among other worthwhile products.</p>
<p>RubyPlay feels confident about this upcoming opportunity, having recently launched with notable operators and brands, including LeoVegas and PokerStars, and is now fully set to make waves in the Latin American region. Commenting on this opportunity, Salsa Technology Head of Marketing &amp; Sales Eliane Nunes said that the partnership was most beneficial to both parties.</p>
<p>Nunes noted that Salsa was actively looking to increase its range of games and provide players with more worthwhile opportunities. Adding first-class titles to offer to operators and customers in the Latin American market is a priority for the company, and this is precisely where RubyPlay comes in.</p>
<p>RubyPlay CEO Trevor Ginsberg was similarly excited about this partnership opportunity and added that the partnership was a great way to bring more hard-hitting and worthwhile content to some of the most interesting jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>"It’s a pleasure to have agreed on this landmark partnership with Salsa Technology, as they are an established Latin American brand, which needs no introduction. We’re confident the company’s extensive operator network will appreciate the new content coming their way," Ginsberg concluded.</p>
<p>RubyPlay remains confident that it will appeal to local audiences in the Latin American region which is fast evolving into one of the most dynamic iGaming places where suppliers are hastening their pace to secure exposure with local brands.</p>
