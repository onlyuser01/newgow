<p>BetOnline partnered with MLW ahead of the debut of MLW Underground Wrestling series on REELZ</p>
<p>Sports media holding company Major League Wrestling (MLW) announced it has entered in partnership with online gaming operator BetOnline.AG and designated the gambling firm as its Official Sportsbook Partner.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Goes Hand-in-Hand with Sports</p>
<p>The agreement with MLW also made BetOnline the title sponsor of the organization that operates across television content, live events and ancillary entertainment in major markets in North America such as the US and Mexico.</p>
<p>Court Bauer, chief executive officer of MLW, noted that wagering on sports is very much “embedded in all forms of sports” and the partnership with BetOnline is natural as both partners share similar values and their products are aligned.</p>
<p>“Just as they are a leader in the rapidly growing sports gaming space, MLW aims to lead in a time when pro wrestling has never been hotter, and we’re looking forward to all the ways this partnership will grow,” Bauer added.</p>
<p>The agreement with BetOnline was announced less than a fortnight after MLW had signed its landmark distribution deal with cable network REELZ and days before its new weekly prime time series, MLW Underground Wrestling, is set to debut on February 7, featuring Alex Hammerstone, Killer Kross, Jacob Fatu, and Mads Kruger, the first-ever MLW action figures produced by BossFightShop.</p>
<p>‘Rabid Fanbase’ and ‘Growing Audience’</p>
<p>Dave Mason, brand manager at BetOnline, was thrilled to see the gambling brand partner with MLW. He emphasized the company’s will to provide support for initiatives that are in alignment with its product and hailed MLW as “a burgeoning behemoth in the pro wrestling space.”</p>
<p>“BetOnline’s sponsorship allows us to heavily engage with MLW’s rabid fanbase, bringing new and exciting entertainment and gambling products to its growing audience,” Mason added, pointing to BetOnline’s history of offering odds for wrestling events of over 15 years and thrilled “to be part of MLW’s trailblazing entry into the industry.”</p>
<p>As one of the fastest growing wrestling leagues nowadays, MLW operates live events in New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Tijuana, while its TV programming features across more than 60 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As an online gambling operator present across multiple verticals, including sportsbook, casino, poker and racing, BetOnline is striving to achieve long-lasting relationships with its customers and the entire gaming community.</p>
<p>In November, BetOnline announced a sponsorship deal with the organizer of the famous nine-ball pool tournament, Mosconi Cup, to become an official partner of the 2022 edition of the tournament which was scheduled to take place in Las Vegas at the end of the month.</p>
