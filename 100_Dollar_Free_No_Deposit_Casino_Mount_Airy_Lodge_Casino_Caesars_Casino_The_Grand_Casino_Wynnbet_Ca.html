<p>Powered by SBC Connect Plus, the three-day event that will kick off with a pre-day conference on May 9, will bring a number of excellent panels and discussions. The Player Protection Symposium, Compliance and Leadership tracks are much looked forward to aspects of the upcoming edition.</p>

<p>The event features a fantastic conference agenda that will put a very strong focus on iGaming, as the segment is beginning to gather momentum and steam and is bound to continue on its growth journey over the coming months and years. There are more than 5 stages and 10 dedicated tracks to see, along with the First Pitch start-up competition which will continue to distinguish promising new companies in iGaming.</p>
<p>There will be more than 300 speakers who will be joining the event and impart their knowledge and insight into various aspects of the gaming industry in the United States and North America. Some of those speakers include:</p>

<p>SBC Founder and CEO Rasmus Sojmark was particularly pleased with the opportunity to see the event take shape and put a strong focus on iGaming and innovation in the sector.</p>
<p>"SBC Summit North America has always focused on the future and how the industry can be innovative, despite restrictive regulations. As we're getting closer to the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning PASPA, it's exciting to see that sports betting has been legalized in most US states and start early conversations about iGaming launch and entry strategies," Sojmark as part of the official release.</p>
