<p>PlayOJO, a UK-based casino website controlled by the Maltese company SkillOnNet Ltd, managed to come out on top at the UK Social Media Awards with its “Safe Bets” campaign. The online casino website got more likes than big companies such as Netflix UK, Sky, and Now TV.</p>
<p>Olivia Bowen at PlayOJO’s Campaign</p>
<p>PlayOJO was nominated and won in the category “Best Use of Social Media for Entertainment” for its “Safe Bets” campaign, which starred Love Island’s, Olivia Bowen. The campaign was presented in the form of the so-called “ad-reel” and was a “spoof” of a promotional video about safer sex.</p>
<p>In the video, Bowen is dressed in a lab coat and gives many tips concerning safer gambling. The reel looks more like an educational video about safe sex from the 1970s or 80s. This campaign approach was used to attract more attention from punters and to be shared more easily on social media, like Facebook and Instagram. In the video, Olivia Bowen highlights the innumerable options for the players to manage their sessions, place bets safely, and enjoy their favorite games. For example, one of PlayOJO’s options is Safe Mate, which is a 24/7 virtual assistant that helps punters with their betting activities. Another option on the casino website is the “Take a Break” function, which allows players to stop betting and temporarily freeze their ability to deposit. In addition, players can take part in a quiz and show what they have learned, and they would receive special PlayOJO condoms, whose packaging shows different word games, which link safer sex to safer betting.</p>
<p>The 2022 UK Social Media Awards, which took place on September 8, 2022, recognized the best campaigns and innovations from UK social media. The rigid judging process includes two phases, the first of which is pre-scoring and determining shortlists. The second step involves judging meetings, at which the different entries are discussed and carefully evaluated.</p>
<p>PlayOJO with Two Awards from the UK Social Media Awards 2021</p>
<p>Peter Bennett, a chief marketing officer at PlayOJO commented that they felt very privileged to be recognized once again by the UK Social Media awards. In the UK Social Media Awards 2021, the casino website gained great success as it obtained two different awards: Best Use of Instagram and Best Use of Social Media with its Compulsion campaign. Bennett also added that PlayOJO campaigns and strategy had continued to be focused on responsible and safer gambling.</p>
<p>PlayOJO is an online casino, which offers more than 3000 games from leading software developers. It holds licenses from the Malta Gaming Authority and the UK Gambling Commission. PlayOJO’s main target audience is UK players, but also punters from countries in Europe, and Canada, are welcome on the website.</p>
