<p>Daily fantasy and sports betting operator DraftKings and the PGA Tour announced today their existing commercial partnership expanded to allow market access for retail and mobile sports betting in Arizona pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Market Access</p>
<p>The announcement came on the heels of the news that Arizona Legislature passed HB2772 and authorized fantasy sports and wagering on sports events in the state and the bill which replaced SB1797 is now sitting on Gov. Ducey’s desk waiting to be signed into law.</p>
<p>“The PGA TOUR commends the State of Arizona and Governor Ducey for their forward-thinking approach to legal sports betting.” Norb Gambuzza, SVP, Media and Gaming, PGA TOUR</p>
<p>DraftKings, which is the Official Daily Fantasy Game and an Official Betting Operator of the PGA TOUR, and the organizer of professional golf tournaments also announced plans to establish and operate a retail sportsbook at TPC Scottsdale under the new agreement.</p>
<p>“When DraftKings became the first Official Betting Operator of the PGA TOUR last summer, a number of possibilities opened up to innovate together. This momentous effort to pursue a first-of-its-kind sportsbook with the PGA TOUR is a testament to the vision of both organizations that we believe will ultimately benefit Arizona sports fans who want to legally bet on sports.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>19th Hole</p>
<p>DraftKings and the PGA Tour, in collaboration with the City of Scottsdale and the host organization of the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the Phoenix Thunderbirds, are working to select a proper location for the “19th hole” retail sportsbook to allow local communities to gain maximum benefits from the new venture.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to work with DraftKings – along with the City of Scottsdale and the Thunderbirds – to explore a one-of-a-kind sportsbook experience at TPC Scottsdale and the world-class Waste Management Phoenix Open. ‘The People’s Open’ is one of the most attended events in golf and with this announcement we look forward to taking the fan experience to another level.” Norb Gambuzza, SVP, Media and Gaming, PGA TOUR</p>
<p>According to the press release, several locations for the visually stunning sportsbook are under consideration as DraftKings and the PGA Tour aim to offer fans at TPC Scottsdale a year-round sports betting experience while enjoying quality food and drinks.</p>
<p>The Waste Management Phoenix Open, or how the Phoenix Thunderbirds like to call their event ‘The People’s Open’, which is hosted annually at TPC Scottsdale, will name DraftKings its exclusive sports betting partner pursuant to the expanded agreement with the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>In addition, collaboration on co-marketing and hospitality initiatives between both parties would look to position TPC Scottsdale as an attractive destination for sports betting and golf fans around the globe.</p>
