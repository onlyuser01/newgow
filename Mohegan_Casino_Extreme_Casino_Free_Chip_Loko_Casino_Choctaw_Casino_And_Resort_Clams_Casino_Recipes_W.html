    <h1>Mohegan Casino Extreme Casino Free Chip Loko Casino Choctaw Casino And Resort Clams Casino Recipes W</h1>

<p>I played their Turbo Poker slots game which has same winning hands</p>
<p>as Holdem Poker. I had balance ( my deposited funds) of just over AU$20.00 i played @ $0.60 a spin. After several spins, amazingly i got a straight flush ( 4 S,5 S, 6 S, 7S &amp; 8 of Spades) a five card winning hand )</p>
<p>whereby i won $240.00 The $240.00 showed up on the display dash,</p>
<p>however, the game did not continue ie:the screen appeared to freeze</p>
<p>on he straight flush for minutes, i tried to revive the game by clicking anywhere o the screen &amp; then the animations continued, however,</p>
<p>my balance on the dash just showed my remaining $19.00 ,</p>
<p>the winnings of $240.00 was not attributed to my acount.</p>
<p>I sought help with online chat, several times explaining in detail that</p>
<p>i have not had my winnings, the chat host insisted that the game wa settled, that i must have errered. I logged out &amp; did all tye usual</p>
<p>fault finding( i have certifications in Microsoft ) clear cookies etc, log out &amp; back in again etc etc. I had taken snap shot wth iphone of frozen screen, as i suspected some software issue may arise, as the delay was just too long &amp; not as usual in the normal play of the spins. I have sent in the screen shots of the $240,00 by email to support,</p>
<p>with no reply forth coming. I returned to log in next day &amp; notify through online live chat again &amp; again the chat host, kept re-iterating</p>
<p>that i must have made error. She said she would check my game history. I had already done that &amp; that specific spin at the slots(ie: that game play , was not down at all in my game history, infact oly one spin was included in my game history at Turbo Poker, when in actual fact i had had at least four or five spins i total.I infoormed the chat host, that it may not be an account issue, but a software issue, in which case, loking at y accont balance would not be revelent,, " i can tell you what my account balance is, i do not need the host "you"</p>
<p>to do that, if my account balance was correct, i would not be notifying the casino of an error. So pointless looking at my account balance, when it is absolutely that in what i am disputing. She made no attempt in any way what-so-ever to say that she wuld take it further, basicaly just dismiss my complaint off hand. Total &amp; utter comptempt for their customer base &amp; bordering on criminaly inclined. How is it Online proffesonal Poker sites have been dissalowed in Australia, but Casinos like this are allowed to continue to operate, begs belief.</p>
