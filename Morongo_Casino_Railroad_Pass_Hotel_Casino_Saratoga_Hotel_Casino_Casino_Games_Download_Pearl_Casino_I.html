    <h1>Morongo Casino Railroad Pass Hotel Casino Saratoga Hotel Casino Casino Games Download Pearl Casino I</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently opened an account with this casino and I deposited and played.</p>
<p>I submitted my verification documents and was told that it would take days to complete</p>
<p>because of this I asked the casino by chat to freeze my account until this verification was complete so I wouldn’t be able to play down my winnings of 3300 euro</p>
<p>they told me that I had to email support - so I sent off an email on the morning of the 28th jan asking for my account to be frozen until the verification was finished</p>
<p>at the time of sending this email I had the amount 3300 euro in my balance</p>
<p>the casino chose to ignore my email and continued to leave my account opened and allowed me to deposit a further 1725 euro</p>
<p>i know the casino recieved my email as later on I received an email on the same thread from them saying that my verification was complete</p>
<p>they didn’t mention anything about freezing my account</p>
<p>looking and their terms and conditions it states if I want to put any restrictions on the account I just need to contact customer support - which is what I initially done by chat - and this option was refused to me</p>
<p>I would really like help firstly receiving the balance that was on my account back which is the amount of 3300 euro and then also retrieving the deposits back which was a further 1725 euro - so in total 5025 euro</p>
<p>the casino should have froze my account on two occasions when asked</p>
<p>I have tried to email the casino in relation to this and again they are choosing not to reply</p>
<p>I really need your help - please let me know if you need anything from me</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Barbara</p>
