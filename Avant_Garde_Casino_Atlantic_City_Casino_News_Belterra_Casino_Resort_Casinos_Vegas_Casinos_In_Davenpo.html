    <h1>Avant Garde Casino Atlantic City Casino News Belterra Casino Resort Casinos Vegas Casinos In Davenpo</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I deposited 3 DASH (cryptocurrency) equivalent to approximately â‚¬ 700 right now, from a wallet I own.</p>
<p>I have been able to gamble without problems since then. I already had my first conflict with them because they gave me a bonus which according to them I did not fulfill the rollover, and when I got to win a figure of about 12 DASH, they suddenly disappeared from my account. They told me it was because I had not met the conditions of the voucher. It was frustrating but I accepted it. They left me a balance of 2.98 DASH (approximately what I deposited.</p>
<p>My problem comes now that I try to at least get my deposited money back. They deny me withdrawals and do not give me explanations. Initially in the chat they told me that they would investigate the case and that they would contact me by email. This was weeks ago and no trace of his response. I have written several emails and they do not respond to me. In the chat, they don't even connect with me either ... It's frustrating to see how these people steal from you with impunity and nobody does anything to close their business. Now that I am in this situation, I see how I am not the only one to whom it happens and it is something common with this bookmaker.</p>
<p>Please, I would greatly appreciate your help. It's a lot of money and I refuse to let these people keep it.</p>
<p>Regards and thank you very much in advance.</p>
