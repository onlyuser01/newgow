<p>The Denver Broncos have announced a multi-year agreement with Esports Entertainment Group (EEG). The deal includes hosting Madden NFL tournaments at Empower Field at Mile High.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos Teams Up with Esports Entertainment Group</p>
<p>EEG was founded in 2008 in Malta as a next-generation online gambling company that focuses on esports. The company and its affiliates focus on helping fans get involved and connected to their favorite esports. Now, the company is taking another step forward to bring sports and esports closer together through their partnership with the NFL franchise Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>According to the Broncos senior vice president of corporate partnerships, Brady Kellogg, the team was the one to reach out to EEG. In his words: “We’re always trying to keep tabs on which partners out there have the potential to make us better and we think we found another one of those in (EEG).”</p>
<p>The Broncos is not the first NFL team to partner with EEG. Last year, the Philadelphia Eagles teamed up with EEG for Madden Tournaments. The Eagles became shareholders as well. The Broncos, on the other hand, decided not to opt-in for any company stock and see how the partnership shakes out.</p>
<p>The Broncos have other means to create revenue. Last year the team signed deals with various gambling companies such as FanDuel, BetFred, and BetMGM. The move made the Broncos the first NFL team to make such deals.</p>
<p>From EEG’s point of view, the partnership with the NFL team is highly beneficial for both parties because of the demographics and enthusiasm for esports in Denver. In 2017, Denver hosted a national gaming tournament tour called DreamHack.</p>
<p>According to Kellogg, the partnership with EEG will help the team to strengthen the relationship between the Broncos and their fanbase. He acknowledged that Esports is rising in popularity, and it’s a unique way of communication with the team’s younger fans.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Broncos and EEG Deal</p>
<p>Kellogg further explained that out of the half a million gamers that live in the Denver metro area, only 5.2% of Broncos gamers live in the city. Kellogg said that the partnership might be used as a means to compete online or push gamers to travel to Denver.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the partnership include hosting three championship-level tournaments per year as well as online competitions. Kellogg said that the current focus is Madden NFL, but he did not exclude other esports titles in the future.</p>
<p>Another very interesting highlight is the opportunity for winners of the tournament to get an autographed memorabilia from the team as well as dinner with a Broncos player. Other prizes include season tickets for championship events.</p>
<p>EEG and Broncos have high hopes to host the Mile High tournament in the summer of 2021.</p>
