    <h1>Panda Master Online Casino Tunica Hotels And Casinos Hotels Near Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St Lo</h1>

<p>Parx Casino in Pennsylvania is facing a new lawsuit by a personal injury firm filed on behalf of a visitor that was assaulted. Philadelphia personal injury firm Wapner Newman revealed Friday it filed a lawsuit against the operator on behalf of a visitor that was assaulted and robbed earlier this month. The firm explained that the incident dates to the early hours of October 1, 2022.</p>
<p>During the incident, the plaintiff, a 71-year-old man who was a guest of Parx Casino, was brutally assaulted and robbed. The lawsuit claims that Parx Casino’s security failed to prevent the incident. Moreover, the claim alleges that the venue’s security did not intervene during the assault and also failed to respond to the attack in a timely manner.</p>
<p>“Our client trusted that Parx would provide him with a safe place to gamble, and to come and go in a safe manner. Parx utterly failed to meet this reasonable expectation.“ Julianna Burdo, member of Wapner Newman’s catastrophic injury group</p>
<p>According to Julianna Burdo, who is a part of Wapner Newman’s catastrophic injury group, the plaintiff trusted Parx Casino to provide a safe place for him to gamble. At the same time, the visitor expected to be safe while coming in and going out of the venue.</p>
<p>“Security personnel at Parx were not patrolling this parking lot and camera surveillance was not being properly monitored, or it was simply ignored,“ added Burdo</p>
<p>Ultimately, Burdo claimed that Parx Casino failed to ensure the safety of their visitor. She also alleged that the venue’s security employees were not guarding the specific parking lot where the customer was attacked. Last but not least, Burdo claimed Parx Casino’s security did not conduct proper surveillance.</p>
<p>The Venue Must Safeguard the Well-Being of Its Visitors</p>
<p>Robert Miller, Wapner Newman’s managing partner, added that the gambling venue has an obligation to keep its visitors safe. He explained that this obligation includes preventing criminal activities, protecting the visitors from such incidents and responding in a timely manner to such events. Miller reassured that the company will seek justice for its client. Finally, he said that visitors to the venue deserve better protection from Parx Casino.</p>
<p>“Parx is obligated to keep its patrons safe. The way to ensure safety and protect its patrons is to prevent criminal activity or detect and respond to incidents in a rapid manner.“ Robert Miller, managing partner at Wapner Newman</p>
<p>Robberies at casino properties aren’t uncommon considering that some perpetrators may target specifically patrons that have won large sums. This is a prime reason why gambling venues implement strict security protocols and solutions such as monitoring, facial recognition and more.</p>
