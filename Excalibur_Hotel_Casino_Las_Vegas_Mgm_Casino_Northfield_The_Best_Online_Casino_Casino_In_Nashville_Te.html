<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming operator, BetMGM, announced a new collaboration with The Tom Joyner Foundation.</p>
<p>Tom Joyner Foundation, Betmgm Announce New Collaboration</p>
<p>The company announced Wednesday, that by joining forces with the foundation, it will launch new executive series for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The new series is expected to launch this fall nationwide. The new collaboration will bring unique experiences and opportunities for HBCU students that will have the chance to meet BetMGM executives. In turn, those experiences may also turn into career opportunities for some of the students after their graduation.</p>
<p>Besides executive-student panels, the new executive series would include job interview preparation, as well as professional resume critiques. Ultimately, the activities planned as a part of the collaboration between the foundation and BetMGM will seek to help senior students when pursuing job opportunities within marketing, product design, finance, HR, and other fields.</p>
<p>Founded in 1998, The Tom Joyner Foundation was named after the famous American retired radio host and the nationally syndicated The Tom Joyner Morning Show former host, Tom Joyner. Since it was founded more than two decades ago, supporting historically black colleges and universities is still one of the Foundation’s main goals. Thanks to the efforts of the foundation, more than $69 million was raised to support students attending HBCUs. Those initiatives have helped the Foundation support more than 32,000 HBCU students.</p>
<p>The Recent Deal Brings Excitement</p>
<p>BetMGM’s CEO, Adam Greenblatt, acknowledged that the company is proud to join forces with The Tom Joyner Foundation and collaborate with HBCU students to help them succeed. He said: “Our goal at BetMGM is to promote equitable candidate experiences and an inclusive working environment.”</p>
