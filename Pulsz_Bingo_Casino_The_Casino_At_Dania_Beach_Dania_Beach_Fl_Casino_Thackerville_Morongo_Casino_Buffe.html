<p>Despite the efforts of law enforcement, illegal gambling activities are common across China. Last month alone, law enforcement in Hong Kong busted multiple brothels and gambling dens in operations that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 people allegedly involved in those activities. The combined efforts of Hong Kong police authorities against triad operations in November saw more than 2,000 officers participate.</p>
<p>Now, the crackdown against illegal gambling and associated crimes continues. As announced by the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong police operations between November 2 and December 2 resulted in the arrest of 130 people, suspected of participating in money laundering and illegal gambling. The report cited police data released Sunday, estimating that the people involved in the illicit activity were able to launder some HK$15 million ($1.92 million).</p>
<p>Between Friday and Sunday, law enforcement arrested five men and three women believed to be involved in a money laundering operation. Among the detainees were transport workers, bar owners, businessmen and beauty salon managers. Out of the eight people arrested, four were believed to be triad gang members. One of the detained individuals was believed to be the ringleader of the money laundering operation.</p>
<p>Citing an investigation, the Hong Kong police said that the alleged leader of the money laundering syndicate used bank accounts belonging to different businesses to transfer large sums of money. The individual is believed to be involved in different companies, but investigators found no legal businesses belonging to the suspect.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the leader of the money laundering operation was able to conduct more than 600 money transactions. The illicit activity has reportedly been ongoing for 10 years, starting from 2013, according to a senior inspector from the New Territories North anti-triad unit.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Shuts Down Illegal Gas Station, Gambling Dens</p>
<p>Police detained more than 120 more people, allegedly tied to five illegal gambling dens as well as an illegal gas station. One of the illegal venues offered baccarat, while two offered gambling machines with fishing games. Two other illegal venues offered mahjong games.</p>
<p>Raids were conducted in Sheung Shui and Ta Kwu Ling, during which law enforcement detained 122 individuals. The detainees were between the ages of 20 and 75, consisting of 66 women and 64 men. During the raids, police seized various items, including bank cards, cash and documents. Proceeds that were allegedly accumulated from the illegal activities estimated at HK$2.5 million ($320,000) were also seized. While some of the alleged culprits were released on bail, others already face charges. The Hong Kong police did not rule out additional arrests.</p>
