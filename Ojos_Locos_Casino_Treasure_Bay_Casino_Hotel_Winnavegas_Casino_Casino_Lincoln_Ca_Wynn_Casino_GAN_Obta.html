<p>The regulatory approval enables the company to start field trails of its GAN Sports betting platform with operators across Nevada</p>
<p>The leading international business-to-customer sports betting operator and North American business-to-business provider of real money internet gaming solutions, GAN, announced it achieved a major milestone in Nevada. The company revealed Friday that it secured regulatory approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, the state governmental agency in charge of regulating gambling activities together with the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>The latest achievement represents a milestone moment for GAN as it enables the company to start a field trial for its GAN Sports betting platform. As a result, the company can conduct trials of its betting platform for customers in Nevada.</p>
<p>Still, to launch its innovative technology in the state, the company requires an additional certification. According to a statement released by GAN, its sports betting platform GAN Sports is prepared with the necessary infrastructure required for its deployment into the regulated gambling market in Nevada. This infrastructure encompasses retail sports betting, as well as mobile applications, the company revealed.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after GAN secured a conditional Nevada license earlier this month. The aforementioned license enabled the company to replace the sports betting platform for Red Rock Resorts’ sportsbooks located in Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>The Company Looks Forward to Launching GAN Sports</p>
<p>Seamus McGill, GAN’s chairman and interim CEO, shared his excitement about the latest regulatory approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission. He said that the company is thrilled about this achievement. Moreover, McGill pointed out that GAN anticipates introducing GAN Sports, its innovative sports product, to customers in Nevada soon.</p>
<p>The company’s chairman and interim CEO added: “The Las Vegas Locals market is one of the largest and most recognizable gaming markets in the world, and we are incredibly excited to be entering it.” Finally, McGill explained that Nevada marks the third US state where GAN Sports will launch and predicted that the solution would bring unrivaled experiences to the market.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased and humbled to have received regulatory approval from the State of Nevada to hold a gaming license. We are excited that we will be launching our leading-edge GAN Sports product in Nevada in the next few months.“ Seamus McGill, chairman and interim CEO of GAN</p>
<p>Late last month, McGill was appointed to the role of interim CEO. At the time, GAN confirmed that it accepted the resignation of its then-CEO, Dermot Smurfit. With Smurfit stepping down from his role, McGill filled in the interim CEO position. It is likely that GAN has already initiated a search for a permanent CEO to fill the role.</p>
