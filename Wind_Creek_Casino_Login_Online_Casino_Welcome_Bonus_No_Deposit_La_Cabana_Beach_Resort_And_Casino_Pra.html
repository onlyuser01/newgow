<p>Playtech is continuing its significant and rapid expansion across Europe with another fresh partnership which is set to push its reach even further. Casumo Casino will now enjoy a range of Playtech products.</p>
<p>Partnership with Casumo</p>
<p>London-listed gambling technology provider Playtech has announced a new commercial partnership to roll out its Casino and Live Casino portfolios across Maltese-based Casumo’s platforms and brand network.</p>
<p>The deal sees Casumo incorporating Playtech’s casino platform into its own services and launching it for players in Sweden, Denmark, Spain and the UK. Players in the UK will also have access to a range of branded Playtech games, such as Justice League and Sporting Legends Suite, through a dedicated tab on Casumo’s own platform.</p>
<p>Playtech’s Casino and Live Casino products will first be integrated into the Casumo brand itself and will eventually be introduced to the group’s wider brand portfolio, including CasinoStreet, Dunder and Kazoom Casino. The partners hope to carry out the wider release in early 2021.</p>
<p>Confidence in Collaboration</p>
<p>Both companies have expressed confidence and trust in the success of the partnership and believe it will be a mutually beneficial endeavor.</p>
<p>Casumo CEO Shelly Suter-Hadad has stated that she was delighted to once again collaborate with the Maltese company’s many-year partner Playtech. “We are looking forward to further developing this relationship over the coming years and working together to bring Playtech games to our players in a variety of established and emerging markets.”, Ms Suter-Hadad stated.</p>
<p>Playtech Chief Operating Officer Shimon Akad has expressed as much confidence in the partnership success. According to him, Casumo is a key player in the new world of gaming as well as one of the most innovative operators on the market. “I am positive that Playtech content will be very popular with Casumo players and we look forward to developing this partnership further in the coming months and years.”, Mr Akad said.</p>
<p>Further Partnerships</p>
<p>Playtech has had a very dynamic year. Its partnership with Casumo is one of the many fresh deals that the company managed to forge or renew this year.</p>
<p>Less than a week ago, the London-listed company announced a partnership with Swiss Casinos Group for access to its online poker software as well as its iPoker Network.</p>
<p>Playtech has also partnered with Golden Matrix for expanded esports presence, extended its partnership with TruNarrative, and successfully launched an online casino in New Jersey with BetMGM.</p>
<p>Further partners include Ireland’s BoyleSports, Greek Novibet and UK-based Rank Group and more. Playtech will enter 2021 with a broad partner network and is likely not slowing down soon.</p>
