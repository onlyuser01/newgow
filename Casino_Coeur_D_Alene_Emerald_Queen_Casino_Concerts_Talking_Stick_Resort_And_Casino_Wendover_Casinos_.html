    <h1>Casino Coeur D Alene Emerald Queen Casino Concerts Talking Stick Resort And Casino Wendover Casinos</h1>

<p>The tough regulatory action comes after the Malta Gambling Authority flagged breaches by the company</p>
<p>MKC Limited is a Malta-based gambling operator that provides casino and betting options via Betworld247. In September last year, the Dutch Gaming Authority, Kansspelautoriteit, uncovered that customers in the country were able to access the operator’s website and gamble, without it holding the necessary license.</p>
<p>As a result, the KSA asked MKC’s Betworld247 brand to exit the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. After warning the company with a penalty of some $100,000, the Dutch regulator confirmed that MKC discontinued its offering for customers in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>While this was one hiccup for the online gambling operator, it is now facing further action, this time from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). Listing a series of compliance-related breaches, the MGA announced Tuesday that it has taken the decision to cancel MKC Limited’s license.</p>
<p>Although the announcement came this week, the Authority’s statement explained that the cancellation of the license is effective as of May 4, 2023. In light of this regulatory sanction, the MGA said that the company is no longer authorized to provide online gambling activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Authority said that MKC Limited must immediately remove any references related to MGA authorization. Describing the breaches, the Malta gambling regulator said that the company breached rules 9 (1)(c), (d), (i), (l), as well as section 10 (1)(a) of the established regulations.</p>
<p>“The Authorized Person is thus no longer authorized to carry out any gaming operations and shall remove, with immediate effect, any reference to the Authority and the authorization,“ reads a statement released by the Malta Gaming Authority</p>
<p>The Authority Describes MKC’s Failures</p>
<p>Describing the breaches, the MGA revealed that MKC failed to pay in a timely manner amounts due to the MGA. Additionally, the Authority said that the operator failed to “meet commitments to players in a timely manner” and failed to “discharge financial commitments for its operations.”</p>
<p>The MGA confirmed that MKC wasn’t able to comply with one or more of its obligations under the laws in Malta. In light of the failures of the established gambling regulations, the Authority said that a cancellation of the license was the proper enforcement action.</p>
