<p>A day after launching in Serbia, Betsson unveiled its plans for further expansion through acquisitions. As announced, the gambling group has completed a EUR 75 million (around $80.4 million) bond issue to fuel its M&amp;A ambitions.</p>
<p>The company explained that the issue is under a framework of up to EUR 250 million ($267 million) and has a tenor of three years. The bond issue also has a floating interest rate of EURIBOR three months plus 460 bps. Finally, Betsson said that the bond issue is set to mature in September 2026.</p>
<p>The group noted that Nordea has acted as the global coordinator of the move. At the same time, Nordea and Swedbank jointly acted as bookrunners for the issue. In the meantime, Gernandt &amp; Danielsson served as the legal counsel of the bond issue.</p>
<p>The Funds Will Be Used for Acquisitions and Other Purposes</p>
<p>Bettson confirmed that it plans to use the funds from the issue of the bonds for various company purposes, which may include acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company’s chief financial officer, Martin Öhman, released a statement on the matter, pointing out that the new bond is in line with Betsson’s strategy and will provide his team with new opportunities.</p>
