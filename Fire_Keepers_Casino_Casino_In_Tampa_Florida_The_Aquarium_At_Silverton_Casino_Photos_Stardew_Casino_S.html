The bad news for him is that his next opponent is another grappling expert. The main in question is Paul Craig who’s 17-6-1 overall with 13 wins by submission.</p>

<p>: 10:00 p.m. ET How to Watch: ESPN+</p>
<p>Reasons Why Brendan Allen is a -400 Favorite</p>
<p>Brendan Allen is a fighter whose fights are great to watch. The evidence of this is that he won the Performance of the Night bonus in two of his last three fights. He’s a fantastic grappler who won each of his last three fights by submission.</p>
<p>This guy also lands a lot of punches and kicks as well. He lands 3.96 significant strikes per minute, which is actually a very high number, especially considering that he’s primarily a grappler. In his most recent fight, he knocked down Bruno Silva, and he did the same on a couple of other occasions.</p>
<p>When it comes to his wins by KO/TKO, he’s got five victories by this method, the last of which happened in 2020 against Tom Breese.</p>
<p>Paul Craig Ready to Upset the Odds (Again)</p>
<p>Paul Craig a.k.a. “Bearjew” is a guy who got us used to staging upsets. So far in his 10+ years-long MMA career, we saw him defeat a number of big favorites, most notably Magomed Ankalaev, Jamahal Hill, and Nikita Krylov.</p>

<p>Here’s a throw back to him submitting Ankalaev with 0:05 seconds remaining on the clock. #UFC pic.twitter.com/VeWd6VAYEr — MMAValour (@MmaValour) November 13, 2023</p>
<p>The Scottish fighter is incredibly fun to watch in the Octagon, the evidence being that he’s won eight Performance of the Night bonuses in his UFC career. The last of those happened in his most recent fight, in which he beat Andre Muniz by a TKO.</p>
<p>That fight is interesting for another reason – it was Craig’s middleweight debut. Before that, he was fighting in the light heavyweight division for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>He’s a big guy who’s two inches taller than his next opponent. He also has a one-inch longer reach than Allen.</p>
<p>Brendan Allen vs. Paul Craig Prediction</p>
<p>Paul Craig was a -500 favorite against Magomed Ankalaev who was undefeated at the time. That didn’t stop “Bearjew” from beating him by submission. We think he can do the same to Brendan Allen on November 18.</p>
<p>Pick: Paul Craig</p>
