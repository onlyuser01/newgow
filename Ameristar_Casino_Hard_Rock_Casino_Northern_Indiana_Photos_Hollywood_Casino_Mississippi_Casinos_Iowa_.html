<p>Pragmatic Play has launched its bingo content with bet365, extending the existing collaboration between the two companies a step further. Pragmatic Play previously entered into collaboration with bet365 to provide the iGaming operator with its library of slot games in May, and the company is now topping up this deal with the bingo offer as well.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play and Bet365 are Already Partners</p>
<p>The fresh collaboration between bet365 and Pragmatic Play will initiative focus on the United Kingdom, but the deal is tipped to go international before long, with both companies confirming their readiness to expand this new content partnership.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is deploying classic titles, such as 90-ball and 75-ball bingo and other innovative content options, such as Pumpkin Blast and Drops Pots, along with Diamond Dazzle and more. The supplier is particularly happy to be expanding with bet365 as it’s one of the most prominent operators in the industry and makes for strong exposure to Pragmatic Play’s products.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play VP of Bingo Claire McDaid welcomed this new opportunity and hailed the chance to be deploying the bingo product with bet365. The partnership was touted as a considerable milestone, McDaid said and was thrilled to see bet365 join the Pragmatic Play Bingo network. She added:</p>
<p>Now proudly supplying both Slots and Bingo to one of the most renowned names in the business is a crucial strengthening of our standing as a multi-vertical provider. The opportunity to place our games in front of a huge number of new players is an incredible boost to our global growth ambitions and we couldn’t be more pleased. Pragmatic Play VP of Bingo Claire McDaid</p>
<p>Bet365 welcomed the opportunity in a similar tone and said that Pragmatic Play was a household name that needed little introduction. The company explained that Pragmatic’s bingo content will be precisely what players need. Pragmatic Play in the meantime continues to drive a steady production pace with a number of titles released every month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pragmatic Play just launched the “Keeping It Reel Slot” on Monday. The company has been producing seven slots a month and is planning to amp up production. Pragmatic Play also recently expanded its headquarters in Malta.</p>
