<p>Offshore online poker operators Americas Cardroom invites players to enter the $8 million guaranteed Venom event held from January 22 through February 3, 2021.</p>
<p>ACR Introduces $8M GTD Venom Event for Late January</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom has revealed a new tournament focused on the US crowd which will run from January 22 through February 3, 2021. The latest iteration of the popular Venom tournament series will feature $8 million in GTD prize money with the minimum top prize set at $1 million, the press release specified.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Americas Cardroom spokesperson Michael Harris said that the company was looking forward to kicking off the year “by making at least one millionaire.”</p>
<p>The latest iteration of The Venom will be the tournament with the biggest prize pool in the event’s history, Harris explained. There are four Day 1 options along with a direct $2,650 buy-in to participate.</p>
<p>The company will allow for direct buy-ins as well as special satellite formats, such as the Steps, Skips, Megas, and Venom Fever promotional offers extended to players and potential participants. According to Harris, there are hundreds of satellites that will secure an entry into the main event, which carries the heftiest prize pool.</p>
<p>Players can participate in the Venom Blitz Steps or Cyclones which will allow players to participate with as little as 11 cents. To move to the next level, players can simply try and earn 5,000 chips. If players are able to enter the 9th level, they will secure a $2,650 seat into the main event.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Plans Four Individual Venom Events in 2021</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom expects the $8 million in prize guarantees to be surpassed dramatically, as the tournament series should drive steady interest from the community. Presently, the Winning Poker Network on which Americas Cardroom is based pays out $160 million in winnings in Bitcoin every month.</p>
<p>This suggests that the actual gross gaming revenue ACR clocks in is much higher. To put a prediction for the expected prize money, the previous edition featured a $7 million guaranteed in prize money and attracted $9,680,000 in total buy-ins. The winner of the event and runner-up won $1,542,024 and $1,135,464 respectively.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if Americas Cardroom can elicit a strong response from American audiences it targets especially now when the United States has legalized online poker in many key states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, and Nevada. ACR, however, remains an offshore poker site and is not licensed to operate in any of the states that allow poker in the US.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the 2021 roadmap looks exciting for Americas Cardroom which has promised to hold four Venoms next year. This will include two Hold’em and PKO event formats.</p>
