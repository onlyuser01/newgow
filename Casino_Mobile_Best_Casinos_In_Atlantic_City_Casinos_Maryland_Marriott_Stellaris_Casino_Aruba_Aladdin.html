    <h1>Casino Mobile Best Casinos In Atlantic City Casinos Maryland Marriott Stellaris Casino Aruba Aladdin</h1>

<p>OnAir Entertainment, a Games Global brand, has expanded its content reach with Rootz, helping the online casino operator to further develop its product offering by introducing its live casino products to the brand, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>As a result, Rootz will benefit from dedicated OnAir Entertainment experiences, that include live casino and game shows, and have been some of the most well-received live gaming experiences in the industry.</p>
<p>Rootz will have access to traditional games such as roulette, blackjack, and casino hold’em, but also get its hands on unique titles such as Nexus Roulette and Card Matchup, among others.</p>
<p>Rootz has welcomed this opportunity to further engage in content building and ensure that its offer provides a good variety of content for players and continues to attract new customers to join in and explore its thousand-strong game library.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Rootz CEO Sam Brow said that the operator was very happy to indeed have found a new partner in Games Global and OnAir Entertainment, adding acclaimed games to the mix.</p>
<p>"This marks a pivotal moment as we continue to expand our offerings and deliver exceptional gaming experiences to our players," Brow added, outlining a meaningful future for the two brands and their collaboration. The executive was similarly confident that thanks to OnAir’s titles, Rootz will be able to attract new customers.</p>
<p>Games Global Chief Revenue Officer Julie Allison was of a similar mind, welcoming the opportunity to work with Rootz and focusing on the live gaming experience.</p>
<p>"By combining their dynamic vision with our technological prowess, we aim to create an extraordinary player journey that reflects the strength of our united efforts," Allison said of this partnership.</p>
<p>Rootz has been steadily building its offering with various content suppliers. Recently, the brand teamed up with another up-and-coming supplier of online casino games in the face of Octoplay.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment has also been a preferred partner for other companies seeking to establish their presence in the live casino vertical and looking for differentiation therein. MrQ recently also teamed up with the supplier to add more variety to its live casino gaming library.</p>
