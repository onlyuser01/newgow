    <h1>All Inclusive Resorts With Casinos Hard Rock Casino Sacramento Best Western Plus Casino Royale Cente</h1>

<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>I want to file a complaint about Slot Wolf casino in order to have my balance paid out. The casino doesn't respond to my verification requests and has been ignoring my uploaded documents for almost three weeks now. I would like to describe the verification process as follows:</p>
<p>On Wed., March 17th I made three deposits of € 50, € 100 and € 50 at the SlotWolf Casino via PaySafeCard. I didn't take advantage of a bonus, after a few big wins my credit is now 4000 euros.</p>
<p>Still on Wed., March 17th I have confirmed my e-mail address via the link in an e-mail from SlotWolf Casino Support. On the same day, to verify my account, I have pictures of the front and back of my ID (with my former home address on the first upload), my registration confirmation to prove my current home address (official document from my home authority as a legally valid proof of address, this has been in all previous Casinos or when issuing a bank loan of course also accepted), an invoice to prove my current home address and the three scanned PaySafeCard receipts including codes. The ID was released immediately, the registration certificate was rejected (reason: not required), my invoice for proof of address was released, the PaySafeCard scans were rejected.</p>
<p>On Friday, March 19th I was asked by e-mail to upload two screenshots of my PaySafeCard account instead of the scans of the PaySafeCard receipts (once with the account details, once with the deposits in the SlotWolf Casino). I did that directly, the scans were approved. However, at this point in time, my former home address was still stored in my PaySafeCard account. Which shouldn't have been a problem due to the valid registration confirmation.</p>
<p>Because the registration certificate was rejected during the upload, but the casino needs it to prove my current address, I received it on Monday, March 22nd. sent by e-mail to SlotWolf support (I wrote the text for this in German and English). I used my business e-mail address (stefan ... @ gmx.de), but in my e-mail I explicitly refer to the e-mail address of my player account at Slot Wolf-Casino (pictures ... @ gmx.de). To be on the safe side, I also sent an e-mail to support from the e-mail address of my player account at Slot Wolf-Casino (pictures ... @ gmx.de) to get my business e-mail address (stefan. .. @ gmx.de). The casino has not responded to either email to this day.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the entire verification process for the casino, I am on Tuesday, March 23rd. personally went to the citizen's office in my city and had the address on my ID updated. At the same time, I had the data in my account updated via PaySafeCard support. Still on Tuesday, March 23rd I have the current pictures on the front and back of my ID and on March 24th. then uploaded the updated screenshots of my PaySafeCard account in the SlotWolf member area. The casino has ignored all four documents to this day (status "pending").</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 25th I asked SlotWolf support whether the documents now fit or whether further documents are needed. The casino has not responded to my request to this day.</p>
<p>I have not received any response from the casino to my requests for verification since March 19, 2021.</p>
<p>On Friday, March 26th This was the first time I turned to Casino Guru for advice. Matej told me on Wednesday, March 31st. replied and advised me to wait two weeks before opening a complaint. Since the casino has not responded for three weeks now, leaves all my inquiries unanswered and ignores the re-uploaded documents in the members area without any reaction, I would now like to open the complaint.</p>
<p>I really hope for your support. A heartfelt thank you!</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Stefan</p>
<p>I would like to point out that - although I have played at many casinos and verified myself many times - I have never experienced anything like this at any casino. I find the casino's behavior not very cooperative and the service not good. Fortunately, I have set a loss limit of 1 euro for 1 month, so that at least I cannot gamble away the profit.</p>
