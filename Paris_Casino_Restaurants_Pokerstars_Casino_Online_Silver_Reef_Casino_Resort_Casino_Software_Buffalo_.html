<p>PlayAGS' slot content will become available to players in New Jersey and Pennsylvania initially</p>
<p>Supplier of gaming products and services to the global gaming industry, PlayAGS, announced it has signed a new online game content partnership with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Boost Caesar’s Online Slot Content</p>
<p>The partnership between PlayAGS and Caesars will see the supplier of slots and table games provide the online betting and gaming brand of Caesars Entertainment with high-performing titles from its portfolio of online gaming content to help boost the operator’s online real-money gaming (RMG) operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, senior vice president of iGaming at Caesars Digital, Matthew Sunderland, outlined that the content provided by PlayAGS would be “an exciting addition” to the operator’s collection of online casino games.</p>
<p>We anticipate this new content to be popular among our players given its successful track record for performing well both online and in brick-and-mortar casinos. Matthew Sunderland, SVP iGaming, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>The partnership will allow Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino to offer its players in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to taste the thrill of more than 30 titles from the supplier’s interactive content library such as Capital Gains, Rakin’ Bakon!, Gold Wins Deluxe, Tiger Lord, and others, that have been proven across land-based venues.</p>
<p>On behalf of PlayAGS, senior vice president and general manager of Interactive, Gary Hardy, expressed how delighted he and everyone at the company is at the opportunity to deepen the relationship with “one of the world’s most high-profile casino brands.”</p>
<p>“Our growing portfolio of player-favorite game themes and track record of delivering consistent game performance should only help to further cement Caesars’ position as a leading operator in the North American RMG market,” Hardy added, looking forward to the months ahead as PlayAGS and Caesars are planning to expand their partnership into more markets.</p>
<p>The partnership with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino is set to further cement the position of PlayAGS as a leader in supplying online gaming content to operators in the US and globally. It is the latest for the supplier following an agreement with online casino content aggregator Pariplay last month.</p>
<p>The agreement with Pariplay saw PLayAGS’ slot content onboarded to Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform and went live in the Canadian province of Alberta via PlayAlberta.ca to make PlayAGS the platform’s first content partner in the province.</p>
<p>The expansion saw PlayAGS’ fan-favorite titles such as Capital Gains, Tiger Lord and Golden Wins Deluxe become available to players in Alberta. It was facilitated by the existing partnership between the aggregator and the iGaming lottery product supplier NeoPollard Interactive.</p>
