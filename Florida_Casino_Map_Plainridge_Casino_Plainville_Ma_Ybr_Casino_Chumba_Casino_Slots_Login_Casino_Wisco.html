    <h1>Florida Casino Map Plainridge Casino Plainville Ma Ybr Casino Chumba Casino Slots Login Casino Wisco</h1>

<p>I've been playing for a while and I'm doing it</p>
<p>Search and I've seen topics here on the forum about demo mode and real mode.</p>
<p>But I wanted to know if it's true. I've done several tests on the cycles within an ID (your identification number within the casino), so each one has its own history and RNG cycles (random nunber generation), but what I noticed is the RNG triggers. which are retention (game takes away from you) average (gives you back the same value) distribution (pays you more value) are the same for relaxation and real mode</p>
<p>What changes and why one plays with real money and another doesn't</p>
<p>So knowing this, if you play demo mode inside the casino</p>
<p>Take the slot, start the game and play until you get the bonus and win</p>
<p>After going to real mode you start to lose and because after a bonus (prize) there is a chance of a retenção (a return of the prize) that's why we lose</p>
<p>If the firing cycle of rng are the same</p>
<p>If we enter the demo inside the casino and the cycle is in a retention cycle (low prizes or no winnings), then you enter real mode, it's still bad</p>
<p>That's why many casinos don't offer demo mode in their slots.</p>
<p>If you are present, test and post your experiences here and provide more information on the subject if it is true for you.</p>
<p>here in all tests it has been proven true that even this</p>
<p>Clearly we have cycles that change all the time</p>
<p>And providers that work with different cycles</p>
<p>Yet that seems to be the case to me.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the providers run RNG cycles 24 times a day, which change according to each ID and winnings from each slot played. If you win a lot on that slot, you may have to return it.</p>
<p>more for her more</p>
<p>Demo help you see what cycle the slot is in?</p>
<p>post your experiences</p>
<p>And what do you think about the RNG cycles in the demo and real mode being the same?</p>
