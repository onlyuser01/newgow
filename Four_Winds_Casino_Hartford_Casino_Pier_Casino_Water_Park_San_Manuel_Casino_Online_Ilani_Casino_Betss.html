    <h1>Four Winds Casino Hartford Casino Pier Casino Water Park San Manuel Casino Online Ilani Casino Betss</h1>

<p>Global online sports betting and gaming operator Betsson announced today a new sports partnership in the Latin American region, teaming with Club Athletico Paranaense until the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Great Projects Ahead</p>
<p>The agreement with Betsson marked the first partnership for the soccer club from the Brazilian city of Curitiba with a sports betting brand. Betsson’s logo is set to debut on the club’s shirts in the match for the Libertadores Cup in Curitiba tomorrow against Estudiantes.</p>
<p>On behalf of Club Athletico Paranaense, commercial, institutional relations and marketing director Mauro Holzmann commented on the announcement, expressing his delight “to have Betsson as a sponsor.”</p>
<p>Pointing to Betsson as a “company operating worldwide with expansion projects that coincide with Athletico’s goals of becoming a reference in football,” Holzmann was convinced that the collaboration would contribute to great projects and the partnership would end up with success for both Athletico and Betsson.</p>
<p>Betsson’s logo will feature via the lower back of the club’s shirt and the betting operator would become the first Athletico sponsor to also have its logo on the women’s kit. On its behalf, Betsson will offer special bonuses on its sports betting platform for fans of the club known among its supporters as the Hurricane.</p>
<p>Expanding Latin American Presence</p>
<p>The club founded in 1924 is also famous for its modern stadium, the Joaquim Américo Stadium, Arena da Baixada, which hosted four matches in the World Cup 2014. The stadium is the first built in Latin America and in the Southern Hemisphere to have a retractable roof.</p>
<p>Betsson’s managing partner in Brazil, Andre Gelfi, also commented on the sponsorship, outlining the synergy with the soccer club “driven by innovation and sport” is exactly what the operator is looking to achieve in the country and “position online betting as a serious and safe entertainment platform.”</p>
<p>According to Gelfi, the partnership would also serve to further increase Betsson’s brand recognition in the South part of Brazil.</p>
<p>For Betsson and its over 20 brands, the sponsorship deal is the latest effort of the gambling group to affirm its presence in the region and in the country where it is the only licensed operator for sports games, offering betting on horse racing in partnership with the Jockey Club of Rio Grande do Sul, and fantasy games.</p>
<p>Last month, Betsson expanded its presence in Latin America by becoming the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the 2022 CONMEBOL Copa América Feminina and helping promote female soccer, and then hired retired soccer professional Ze Roberto in an ambassador capacity.</p>
