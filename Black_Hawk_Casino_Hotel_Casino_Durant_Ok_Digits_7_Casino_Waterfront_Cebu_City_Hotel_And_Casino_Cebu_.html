<p>Sports Illustrated Sportsbook, which is launched in collaboration with 888, has confirmed that it has selected OpenBet as its content and platform partner to help with the launch of the brand’s retail sports betting operations.</p>
<p>This follows the launch of the online platform which has been deemed a success, and allowed Sports Illustrated to establish itself at a time when sports publications and media groups are driving strong forays into the gambling space, notably with ESPN and Fanatics’ own plans in the vertical.</p>
<p>The Sports Illustrated retail sportsbook is based in Michigan’s Island Resort &amp; Casino and it now benefits from the full library of solutions brought by OpenBet’s world-class retail options. This includes betting counters and self-serving kiosks which have been developed by the highest industry standards and powered by OpenBet’s cutting-edge platform.</p>
<p>This is a win for all parties involved, as OpenBet is convinced that its launch with another prominent operator will help it solidify its standing in the United States whereas Sports Illustrated is confident in the quality of the service that it can now provide through its land-based betting hub.</p>
<p>OpenBet VP for the US Deb Krupinski was similarly excited to see his company form this alliance with 888 and Sports Illustrated Sportsbook and power the land-based operations in Michigan.</p>
<p>"Delivering this landmark retail platform for such an iconic brand is a significant milestone for OpenBet and underscores our commitment to ensuring our partners are equipped with cutting-edge technology and unrivalled content. We’re excited about the future and eager to see the successes this launch will bring," Krupinski said speaking of the new opportunity.</p>
<p>888 Holdings US President Howard Mittman was excited to see the tech company power the Sports Illustrated Sportsbook as well. It’s a great foothold for the company in Michigan and an opportunity to cater to local demand for quality sports betting markets.</p>
<p>"As we stand on the cusp of this exciting new chapter, our collective vision and expertise are set to redefine customer experiences," Mittman added.</p>
<p>OpenBet has been one of the leading companies in the provision of technical solutions for the land-based and digital betting sectors. The company was acquired in a landmark deal from Scientific Games by Endeavor in 2021 and bought for $1.2bn.</p>
