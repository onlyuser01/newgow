    <h1>Crazy Moose Casino Palms Resort And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Potawatomi Hotel Casino Restaurants Hote</h1>

<p>I saw that my account was blocked on 03/31/2023. That's when I entered the chat and they informed me that I needed to send an email with the following data..</p>
<p>BCGame username</p>
<p>Registered email address</p>
<p>Single Deposit Transaction (TXID)</p>
<p>Commonly used IP address</p>
<p>commonly used device</p>
<p>After I sent the email with the data they returned the email with the form kyc..</p>
<p>I completed the form as requested and on 04/09/2023 they sent me another email requesting</p>
<p>Proof of residence</p>
<p>Bank statement</p>
<p>Proof of income</p>
<p>I went to support to find out about the Proof of Address, as I live with my mother and the house is hers, so the Proof of Address is in her name.. But I was informed that it could be in her name, but I need to be of legal age, everything being correct, I sent the data again..</p>
<p>On 04/14/2023 they sent me an email apologizing for the delay..</p>
<p>On 04/22/2023 another email arrived..</p>
<p>Regarding your bank statement, can you provide details about transactions above 2,500 BRL? We are requesting this as part of our AML policy.</p>
<p>I took the data from a deposit via pix that I made for the 2500 BRL platform and sent it by email..</p>
<p>After that, I didn't get any more answers from BC.game.. I sent 2 e-mails with the data requested above because I thought I sent something wrong, but even so, I still don't get a response.. If I sent any wrong data or if something was missing, BC.game should have informed me so that the correction could be made.. Which was not done.. I have all the e-mails as proof that I sent the data.. I await a response.. Thank you very much..</p>
