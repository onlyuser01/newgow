<p>The deal will amplify IWG’s success and proposition, generating a lot of value for the supplier’s partners</p>
<p>Lottery leader Allwyn announced that it has teamed up with Instant Win Gaming (IWG), a leading supplier of digital e-Instant and instant win games.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Allwyn has joined forces with IWG’s co-founders, Rhydian Fisher and Simon Bucknall, and will work with them to unlock new opportunities to innovate the instant win games sector. The deal will strengthen the lottery operator’s content offering, allowing it to bolster its already strong portfolio.</p>
<p>Allwyn added that it has agreed to invest in IWG. Upon closing, the deal will see the former company acquire a 70% stake in the latter business. Allwyn explained that it would finance this venture using its existing financial resources.</p>
<p>The investment is expected to close in the second half of 2024 and is still subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Allwyn noted that no changes will be made to IWG’s team following the conclusion of this deal. As a result, Rhydian Fisher and Simon Bucknall will retain their roles as chief executive officer and chief operating officer, respectively.</p>
<p>IWG supplies over 25 national and state lotteries with instant win games and has a strong presence in the key North American market. The provider sits at the forefront of innovation and boasts a strong portfolio of games across many categories.</p>
<p>For reference, IWG reported an EBITDA of £18.2 million on April 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Take IWG to the Next Level</p>
<p>Representatives commented on Allwyn’s investment in IWG. The former company’s chief investment officer, Stepan Dlouhy, said that the deal will enable his team to “create and leverage high-quality content throughout the group.” Dlouhy explained that this move is a testament to Allwyn’s ambition to deliver a best-in-class experience to its international player base.</p>
<p>Dlouhy also lauded the expertise IWG’s co-founders have cultivated over the years.</p>
<p>Rhydian and Simon bring a wealth of sector knowledge and creativity and we are excited to collaborate and explore new opportunities. Stepan Dlouhy, chief investment officer, Allwyn</p>
<p>In the meantime, Rhydian Fisher, IWG’s CEO, said that his team is “thrilled to be partnering with Allwyn.” Fisher explained that the deal will amplify IWG’s success and proposition, generating a lot of value for the supplier’s partners.</p>
<p>Allwyn’s deep expertise and knowledge of the lottery consumer will help us to deliver immediate and significant value for our existing partners, while this step will also create new opportunities for the brilliant games our team develops. Rhydian Fisher, CEO, IWG</p>
