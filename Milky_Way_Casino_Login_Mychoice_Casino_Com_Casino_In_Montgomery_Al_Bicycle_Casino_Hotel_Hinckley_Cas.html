    <h1>Milky Way Casino Login Mychoice Casino Com Casino In Montgomery Al Bicycle Casino Hotel Hinckley Cas</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I had my account blocked by betmotion after requesting a withdrawal. Let's get to the facts:</p>
<p>1) I opened my account on the website and sent the documents, leaving the account validated (I have the email sent by the risk management team confirming this).</p>
<p>2) after that, I made a deposit on the website and placed four bets on normal matches and with plenty of liquidity, as can be seen below:</p>
<p>german bundesliga, leverkusen x freiburg, 400 reais at freiburg odds 4.10</p>
<p>spanish cup, barcelona x sevilla, 720 at barcelona odds 1.51</p>
<p>italian Calcio, milan x udinese, 400 reais at milan odds 1.83</p>
<p>italian Calcio, rome x genoa 520 reais at rome odds 1.53</p>
<p>3) after completing the rollover conditions (I even wagered 40 reais more than the required rollover) I requested a withdrawal by e-wallet pay4fun.</p>
<p>4) to my surprise I received an email saying that my account was blocked and that I did not comply with the website's term 74 (email Ticket # WDRU3)</p>
<p>"74.- Betmotion reserves the right to review each transaction and registration of each user in any case. If after the review a user or group of users who are participating in betting strategies is found, which at the sole discretion of the Betmotion and the department in charge are considered abusive or fraudulent, so Betmotion reserves the right to deny the participation of said user or group of users in promotions, in addition to being able to request that all Bonuses or gains obtained with it are withdrawn or canceled. The Risk department reserves the right to charge a fee for administrative expenses that may be charged for returning these transactions "</p>
<p>5) Analyzing what the company claims, that is, that a user or group of users who are participating in betting strategies ... considered abusive or fraudulent, I have to say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, I have no connection with any group of users and place my bets based on what I follow in football, I don't even follow a group of tipsters because I really trust my personal analysis. In other words, this argument is totally unfounded and I challenge the company to present any type of "proof" that led it to this conclusion, because I categorically affirm that it does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, I made regular bets (pre-game and in the main European leagues), having reached a balance of 1591 reais after fulfilling the 2000 reais rollover of the site (I even exceeded the required amount). The bets I made on the account were just the four reported above, betmotion can confirm this. What is the abusive betting strategy or fraudulent that the company claims? Four bets on big league games, on markets with high liquidity and normal values. This is not a game strategy, it is the competence of knowing how to choose bets well and also being lucky.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked the risk department to reassess that decision. They responded 48 hours later saying that my account was related to a user called "AnaBele". They did not present how the account was related, why it was related and who AnaBele is.</p>
<p>I have no idea who this person is and why they related hi or her to me. I requested the evidence for betmotion again and they didn't present it, they just said it was the final decision and that they will not pay my money.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am in a situation where they accuse me of something I did not do, steal my money and refuse to provide any kind of evidence. I ask for your help to recover the balance amount that I had in my account, please.</p>
<p>I have an extremely calm conscience that I did not break any terms and that I did not act in collusion with another user, even more with a person that I have no idea who he/she is.</p>
