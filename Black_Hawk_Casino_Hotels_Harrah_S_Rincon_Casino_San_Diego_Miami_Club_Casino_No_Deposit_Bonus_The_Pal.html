    <h1>Black Hawk Casino Hotels Harrah S Rincon Casino San Diego Miami Club Casino No Deposit Bonus The Pal</h1>

<p>I still don't understand how or why I am being accused for cheating, as they just said there are holes in there system; but it's definitely something that I attempted to exploit?</p>
<p>Winning felt really rewarding , it's not a common occurrence. Cheating is cheating, but if the error of such holes are from there system...without knowing they even exist how can I be held accountable as Cheater if the only action was to press the spin button?? To the extend that it cost me my account, when the error of there system should have only ideally cost me the winnings? Why my account? How is there evidence indicative that reflects I had knowledge of such exploits to which they know for certain it was my intent to cheat, to the point of holding me directly accountable for my implicit attempts to exploit such vulnerabilities?:</p>
<p>Not to mention this whole vindication of finally winning, why or how could anyone honestly believe they could have done so if they them self knew they cheated? Does it even make since that I would go through all this effort unless I felt like I was being wrong by the casino? Like I'm I've written enough across this complaint and in my review that should at least be acknowledged for my efforts to convey the plight of an individual who hasn't changed his story, was denied clarification when inquiring about my account, find out they're blaming me for my implicit action to exploit a vulnerability purposely, and accept such as the only truth while being denied any attempts without our casino-guru for recourse.</p>
<p>I don't have footage of my spins, I'm starting to believe people should record there use of a online casino, cuz it's a tough pill to swallow knowing if my proof of a win, doesn't match the system I won't get compensated. That only in the the case that my proof of win matches the system of a win will I get paid out.</p>
<p>Yet still suppose to trust the credulous perspective of a system that will only accept client provided proof if and only it matches there records??</p>
<p>Had a single one of my spins not reflected a winning paying reel on my end, would I have not tried to address a concern that in not doing so could have potentially cost me my winnings? Like I don't know about you but its expressively clear to me honesty is key.</p>
<p>I'm also curious, exactly how many times did I attempt exploit this so called "vulnerability" was it statically? Or consistent? How many spins in total were there grom the time I won the 50 udst till my account was banned? Plus time stamps of every spin ( ideally reflecting my local time ) as such should correlate a pretty consistent average of someone who was constantly pushing a spin button to have been able to do be elsewhere? To cheat? As they claim? I will say that the night of my success I was in the middle of a blizzard, stuck in a no way outta predicament my phone and ya'll casino were all I had to hold on to. Could by chance the weather and poor singal strength be the reason of my success?</p>
<p>Cuz I didn't, nor would I ever cheat. Winning is not important enough to me that I can't accept to lose, surely I've conveyed this belief.</p>
<p>Why then should it in the end cost me my account and not just the errant funds there system accidentally paid out. So much to the point under no knowledge of a vulnerability, nor implicit attempt to exploit such hole; that I need proof I could never have to prove I'm right about anything that does match there records if the only creditable records are they ones they submit?</p>
<p>The least they could do is acknowledge via a clear and systemic pattern that absolutely undeniably signifies attempting to exploit whatever vulnerability they claim, in between the margins of each spin.</p>
<p>üôÅ As I said I don't care about the money. Knowing I won, can't effect my resolve if known I did so without cheating; ultimately accepting a world that one might lose winnings inlight of an errant payout. But also need to accept that a casino can blame the user at the cost of the users account for there involuntary inadvertent exploit of a vulnerability they didn't know existed?</p>
<p>The negligence of this casino should cost them there ability to operate, not my account ability to access it. I should be rewarded for aiding there ability to identifying this so called "vulnerability" I in absolutely no way attempted to exploit or gleaned profit from.</p>
<p>Had they taken the money, I could have lived with that. There need to paint me cheater costing me my account, is the line in the sand as it often drawn by anyone who can recognize the discrepancy between two sides and each of their efforts should reflect similar events and correspond with the opposed version.</p>
<p>Any evidence they have better be a "last nail in the coffin) definitive of my direct attempts to exploit this supposed "vulnerability", plus the dates and times of all spins, and numbers of apparent attempts my implicit direct action was clearly an attempt cheat.</p>
