<p>Novig will initially serve as a regular sports betting operator, instead of as an exchange</p>
<p>Novig, an innovative sports betting market that seeks to redefine the wagering sector, has been greenlit to launch in Colorado by the Colorado Division of Gaming. Now boasting an Internet Sports Betting Operator license, the company will be able to make a foray into the lucrative US market.</p>
<p>Colorado will notably be Novig’s first state. The company plans to launch there next month in partnership with Full House Resorts and its Bronco Billy’s Casino property in Cripple Creek.</p>
<p>Coloradoans will soon be able to experience Novig and its exciting wagering markets. The Noivg app will be available to both iOS and Android users, providing players with tons of betting excitement at their fingertips.</p>
<p>However, at least initially, Novig will serve as a regular sports betting operator, instead of as an exchange. Should the CLGC greenlight exchange wagering, Novig plans to launch its flagship exchange wagering options in the state as well.</p>
<p>At first, the Novig app in Colorado will offer wagering options for some of the biggest leagues in North America, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NCAAF and NCAAB. The company plans to further diversify the markets it offers in the state in 2024.</p>
<p>Novig Looking Forward to Launching in Colorado</p>
<p>Jacob Fortinsky, Novig’s co-founder and chief executive officer, commented on the launch in Colorado, praising it as a major development for his company. He thanked the Colorado Division of Gaming for its incredible help throughout the entire licensing process.</p>
<p>Fortinsky added:</p>
<p>We’re committed to building an unparalleled, community-led betting experience, and we look forward to becoming the go-to destination for sports fanatics and sharp bettors alike. Jacob Fortinsky, co-founder &amp; CEO, Novig</p>
<p>Founded by Fortinsky and Kelechi Ukah, Novig is backed by a number of major investors, including Joe Montana, Lux Capital and Y Combinator. Novig hopes that exchange wagering will secure approval from the CLGC, allowing the company to launch the first commission-free, high-frequency sports betting exchange in Colorado.</p>
<p>A month ago, Novig forged a new comprehensive agreement with US Integrity, a leading technology-driven sports betting monitoring company. This move proved Novig’s desire to fortify the foundational elements of its products and protect the integrity of the sports betting sector.</p>
