    <h1>Jai Alai Casino Tahoe Casinos Eagle Aruba Resort Casino San Juan Casino Casino Royale Watch Movie Is</h1>

<p>Dear Justinh80,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked the bonus policy, and this is what I found: https://slotswincasino.com/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>"FREE BONUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>The minimum and maximum withdrawal permitted on existing and previous free money bonuses is capped at $ 100.00. Any funds left from free winnings will be immediately removed from the player account after processing the withdrawal. The person who tries to go above this limit will have the funds removed from his/her account.</p>
<p>Withdrawals from free bonus promotions of $ 100.00 are only processed when a copy of your driver’s license and a utility bill is received, matching the name, DOB and address registered on your SlotsWin account.</p>
<p>A verification deposit of minimum $10 via Bitcoin or $25 with a card will have to be made and wagered at least once through before a withdrawal originating from a no deposit bonus will be paid to you.</p>
<p>(...)Wagering of credits/withdrawals originating from free bonus money, free spins and leaderboard promotions, will carry the maximum withdrawal limit specified on the original bonus claimed. All remaining funds will be forfeited and removed from the account at the time of processing."</p>
<p>Could you please clarify whether you started to play the roulette with a balance of 100 or with a balance of 350? Have you deposited a minimum deposit specified in the terms?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
