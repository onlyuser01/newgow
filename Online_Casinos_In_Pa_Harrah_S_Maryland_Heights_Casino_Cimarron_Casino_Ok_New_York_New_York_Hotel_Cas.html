<p>Live the Saint Tropez Dream</p>
<p>Speaking about the new Dream Drop Diamonds release, the studio’s chief executive officer Simon Hammon described it as yet another ”thrilling and engaging” title that will add value to its portfolio. Hammon put the emphasis on the game’s top-notch mechanics, game features, classic luxurious theme, and “exciting gameplay twists.” All these elements are expected to instantly win over players’ hearts.</p>
<p>It all begins with an invitation that is hard to resist. Relax Gaming ushers players into a world where relaxation, riches, and satisfaction are a lifestyle. Sit by the poolside of a luxurious villa in Saint Tropez, admire the light blue of the sea and relax listening to the cool EDM tracks in the background while spinning the reels on the 5×5 grid. Keep collecting the precious diamonds for a max win of 10,640x the stake and keep a close eye on the Dream Drop Jackpot and the Free Spins Bonus.</p>
<p>Free Spins Bonus &amp; Dream Drop Bonus</p>
<p>To initiate the Free Spin Bonus, players must land a minimum of three bonus symbols on random reels. All the diamonds that a player managed to collect up to that point will be used to fill a meter. The meter is used to award multiplied prizes up to 1,000x the bet during the Free Spins Bonus feature.</p>
<p>During the same feature, all extra bonus symbols landing on the reels will beef up the Diamond Collection prizes up to 10x, while offering an extra free spin. All the diamonds that a player scoops up during free spins are maintained between spins to trigger even bigger wins.</p>
<p>When at least five Dream Drop symbols are seen landing after a Jackpot Spin, players are sent into the Dream Drop Bonus. During this bonus round, players need to do their best to fill the rows with Dream Drop symbols. This will activate one of the five available jackpots in the game: Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major, and Mega Jackpot. Their values start at €1 for the Rapid, €5 for the Midi, €100 for the Maxi, €25,000 for the Major, and €500,000 for the Mega jackpot.</p>
<p>Continuing its expansion plans, Relax Gaming added Thunderkick to its Powered By program at the end of September, while also striking a deal with Quantum Gaming during the same month.</p>
