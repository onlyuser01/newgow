<p>Washington Redskins First NFL Team to Offer Live Predictive Gaming During Telecasts</p>

<p>The Washington Redskins will offer in-game predictive gaming during television broadcasts of the team’s four preseason contests, becoming the first NFL franchise to do so.</p>

<p>Dubbed “Predict The Game,” the offering will be free to play for viewers and participants can win up to $1,000 cash per quarter (there are four quarters in an NFL game) as well as other prizes. “Predict The Game” will only be available on NBC Sports Washington Plus, a unit of the network’s Washington sports affiliate.</p>
<p>The enhanced experience on NBC Sports Washington Plus will feature Predict the Game elements and other interactive features, combined with real-time statistics and information, displayed on a graphic overlay surrounding the game telecast,” according to a statement issued by the Redskins.</p>
<p>Predictive gaming can include questions such as “Who will have the most passing yards this half?” From there, viewers would select one of the Redskins quarterbacks. Participants can also play via mobile devices or desktop computers.</p>
<p>“A top eligible scorer at the end of each quarter will earn or share the $1,000 prize, with a new game beginning each quarter,” according to the statement. “Randomly selected participants will also be eligible to receive other outstanding 2nd chance prizes such as game tickets, VIP experiences and memorabilia.”</p>
<p>Other Leagues Trying It, Too</p>
<p>Washington’s first preseason game is Thursday night at the Cleveland Browns, followed by a home tilt with the Cincinnati Bengals on Aug. 15. The Redskins then head to Atlanta to play the Falcons on Aug. 22, before returning home to face the Baltimore Ravens on Aug. 29.</p>
<p>Other professional leagues have tinkered with predictive, in-game contests. Earlier this year, the NBA’s Sacramento Kings announced a partnership with Swish Analytics for the “Sacramento Kings Skyloft Predictive Gaming Lounge.” That venue was made available in March to certain ticket holders at the Kings’ home arena, Golden 1 Center.</p>
<p>Fans were allowed to bet on point totals and margins of victory for quarters, halves, and the full game. In addition, they can bet on various player props, such as points, assists, rebounds, and three-pointers made.</p>
<p>The Kings’ effort was widely viewed as potentially setting the stage for live wagering from arenas and stadiums across the major US athletic leagues.</p>
<p>In July, Monumental Sports and Entertainment (MSE), the company that owns Washington Wizards and Capitals of the NBA and NHL, respectively, unveiled a deal for real-time stats feeds from Sportradar.</p>
<p>Suitable Alternative</p>
<p>Washington, DC has signed off on sports betting, but efforts to bring that to life are being hampered by the controversy swirling around the city council’s decision to award a $215 million sports betting contract to Greek gaming company Intralot.</p>
<p>Intralot’s financial health has been scrutinized as have some council members’ ties to the company, but it is possible that the city has sports wagering ready by this fall. In addition, questions remain on how many sports betting licenses the District of Columbia will award to bars, restaurants, and hotels across the city. The city will also award licenses to the four major sports arenas and stadiums located within the district.</p>
<p>For now, the “Predict The Game” option is the only game in town for Redskins bettors. Once District of Columbia officials sign off on sports betting regulations and start issuing licenses, fans of the team living in Maryland and Virginia will need to head to DC to make an investment because sports betting isn’t yet legal in those states.</p>
<p>Because the Redskins play their home games in Landover, Md., in-stadium betting in DC will not be applicable to them.</p>
