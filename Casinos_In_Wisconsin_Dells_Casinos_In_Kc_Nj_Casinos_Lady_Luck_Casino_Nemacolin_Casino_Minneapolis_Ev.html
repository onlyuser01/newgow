<p>Evolution Is Now Live in Buenos Aires Province</p>
<p>World-leader in product innovation and advanced IT solutions for video streamed live casino, Evolution, announced the launch of its leading casino games in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The launch was carried out in a partnership with the operator BetWarrior. As a result, Evolution’s portfolio of live dealer games is now available at www.betwarrior.bet.ar.</p>
<p>Besides traditional live dealer games, players can also enjoy Evolution’s first-person range of games, as well as more than 100 highly popular online slots from the company’s brands Red Tiger and NetEnt. But that’s not all. Users can also soon enjoy live games from Ezugi, which is another Evolution brand. The company explained that it will soon go live with more operators, which will further boost the content options available for the players.</p>
<p>The Launch Brings Excitement for Operators and Consumers</p>
<p>Evolution’s head of LATAM operations, Mónica Umaña, said that the launch marks an exciting moment for operators and players in Buenos Aires province. She acknowledged that Evolution’s games offer unrivaled online gaming entertainment in regulated markets globally. Umaña outlined that currently, Evolution offers a variety of games for players in Buenos Aires province. Players within the province can enjoy live blackjack and roulette in multiple variants, as well as the award-winning Lightning Roulette.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting time for operators and their players in the Buenos Aires Province and Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.” Mónica Umaña, Head of Operations LATAM at Evolution</p>
<p>On the other hand, Evolution offers plenty of top-performing slots so slots fans will be able to choose from multiple Red Tiger titles, as well as NetEnt’s Starburst and Divine Fortune Megaways, explained Umaña. In conclusion, she added that this launch marks only the beginning as Evolution plans to constantly develop new titles and continue growing within the market.</p>
<p>The Argentinian Online Gambling Market Continues to Grow</p>
<p>The recent launch makes Evolution the first and only live casino provider to go live from the first day of the regulated market launch in Buenos Aires Province. Moreover, the company currently offers slots and RNG games within the market of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Although in some provinces, such as Córdoba, online gambling legalization is still in the making, others have already legalized the activity. In fact, out of the 23 provincial jurisdictions, so far, 9 jurisdictions as well as the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires have legalized and launched online gambling. Undoubtedly, considering the 45 million population of the country, the market in Argentina will continue growing.</p>
