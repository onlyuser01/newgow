He will now help Playson to achieve its long-term growth objectives and reach partners worldwide. Commenting on the appointment, Playson CEO Alex Ivshin welcomed Rudenko in his new position as head of the platform.</p>
<p>He praised the man’s expertise with infrastructure and solutions as well as platform integrations and argued that Rudenko will play yet more important roles in expanding the product’s reach.</p>
<p>“The recent internal adjustments we’ve made will allow us to meet our enhanced growth plans, with our eyes set firmly on expanding and cementing our position in key markets across the world,” Ivshin said.</p>
