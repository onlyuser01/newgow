<p>La Tomatina review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around La Tomatina, the Spanish festival celebrated by throwing tomatoes.</p>
<p>Players will wander into a sunny Spanish town and prepare to take part in a cheerful tomato fight. With other participants close at hand, players will need to be quick to grab the juicy red produce if they want to compete.</p>
<p>La Tomatina is a good slot for players looking for a holiday vibe and a chilled out atmosphere.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has a warm tone, and it's easy to imagine hearing it playing during a street festival. The reels spin with a satisfying click that gives them an authentic feel.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will see an array of traditional Spanish items, including an elaborate fan, castanets, embellished hats, and guitars. Tomatoes of different hues also make an appearance among the symbols.</p>
<p>On either side of the reels, mischievous festival participants sway with half-ripe tomatoes in their hands. It seems that at any moment, they might playfully lunge towards each other, hurling their produce.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, players will glimpse the pale stone walls of the town, as well as even more crates of tomatoes. The quality of the animation is cartoonish, but bright and welcoming.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a festive Spanish atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>La Tomatina is a five reel, four row slot with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>Wins are calculated from the leftmost reel, and only the highest win is paid on a win line.</p>
<p>The gameplay is swift, holding attention with ease.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Red Tomato and Yellow Tomato Wild symbols substitute for all regular symbols. These Wild symbols carry a x1 multiplier in the base game and a x2 multiplier during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>The Flux Spins feature is activated when at least one Red Tomato symbol lands. The Red Tomato symbol then expands vertically, and the Flux Spins feature concludes when the Red Tomato symbol makes it to the bottom cell.</p>
<p>The Sticky Respins feature is triggered when players land at least one Yellow Tomato symbol. The number of Respins awarded depends on how many Yellow Tomato symbols appear.</p>
<p>Throughout the Sticky Respins feature, the Yellow Tomato remains stuck in place. Each position where a Yellow Tomato symbol lands is given a colored background to set it apart.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered by the positions marked during the Sticky Respin feature. Players are awarded 10 free spins, and they can choose to play with either the Flux Spins or Sticky Respins active.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature cannot be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.05%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.40 up to a maximum of $/£/€80.00 per spin.</p>
<p>With medium volatility, La Tomatina is a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium volatility La Tomatina-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a disappointing RTP and lackluster volatility, La Tomatina is not a good find for mathematically minded players.</p>
<p>The cheerful atmosphere and bonuses may entice some players, though these may wish to move on to slots that offer a more favourable RTP.</p>
