    <h1>Funzpoints Casino App Download Casino Shelbyville Fortunejack Casino Wynn Las Vegas Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>I deposited roughly around 800€ in total to my account. After I lost initial 200€ and 300€ i eventually started winning and made about 3k € in profit. I passed the verification process in the beginning already and I decided to make a withdrawal of my winnings after about a month of playing. It was rejected and they asked for further verification. I obliged and sent them required documents. But that was not enough. They kept adding and adding the documents, which at the end included:</p>
<p>-photo of my ID</p>
<p>-photo of my passport</p>
<p>-address proof</p>
<p>-selfie with my username</p>
<p>-selfie with my ID</p>
<p>-my crypto wallet used for deposit</p>
<p>-selfie with my crypto wallet</p>
<p>-notarised copy of ID</p>
<p>-notarised proof of address</p>
<p>-selfie with notarised documents</p>
<p>-again a photo of ID</p>
<p>After i provided all that and they finally ran out of excuses and documents I need to provide they sent me a message that my account is now open for withdrawals. I had a pending withdrawal of 500$ which was approved (much later than they said it would) and on the same day as it was approved I wanted to withdraw the rest (around 3.3k$). I tried to login but found my account BLOCKED. I went on live chat and the agent said i will get a reply in 12-24hrs. I waited. Went on live chat again after a week, the agent said I will DEFINITELY get a reply same day. I waited. Sent numerous emails. Nothing. Went on live chat again. Same lies again. I waited more. Its been more than 3 weeks, my account is blocked, and they keep ignoring me and giving me more lies.</p>
<p>After I posted my review on your site I eventually got an answer. I begged and begged for weeks for them to reply and there was of course none. After few reviews they decided I am worthy of a reply after all. However they wrote me they blocked my account because their system detected me at strange locations and that I said I was never outside Slovenia and that this statement therefore doesn’t match their logs and this is the problem. Since I know them well by now and I know they are desperate and will do anything to steal my money, I sent all the livechat transcripts to my email. I replied and sent them the transcripts with dates and data so they saw they are being caught lying again. I never said anything remotely similar to this since I know i travel for work and I take my laptop with me. They replied back that indeed they made a mistake and i indeed didnt say this but that i was still detected in few different countries. I replied again that this is 21st century and people travel and therefore their devices will be occasionally detected outside their little country where they live.</p>
<p>They said they are willing to pay me 600€ out of 3.3k and also hoping that i will delete the reviews. They owe me 3.300 € and they act like we are on a market in Asia, we will not pay 3.300€ but we give you 600€! They know they got absolutely nothing because we all very well know if legitimately I would do something wrong they wouldn’t be willing to pay one penny. Of course I declined and told them this is an absolute disgrace and that they need to pay everything what they owe but now again ignore mode. Its been more than two months already since I am trying to withdraw my hard earned money and as of today no money has been paid out. (Other than the 500€ back in October)</p>
