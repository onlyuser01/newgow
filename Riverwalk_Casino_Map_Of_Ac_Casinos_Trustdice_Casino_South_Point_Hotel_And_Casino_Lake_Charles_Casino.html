<p>Ryan Garcia is walking out against Luke Campbell for a shot at the interim WBC lightweight title.</p>
<p>Ryan Garcia vs Luke Campbell: Interim WBC Lightweight Bout</p>
<p>This Saturday, January 2, 2021, we are witnessing the first big-ticket fight for the year with Luke Campbell squaring up versus Ryan Garcia, the Instagram sensation who has been taken with mixed feelings among the boxing community. The fight date is drawing near and predictions are due.</p>
<p>Garcia’s promotional stunts have cost him a lot of ridicule by hardcore boxing fans, but his repeated triumphs against a string of undefeated opponents have begun earning him some of the community’s respect.</p>
<p>Fighting against Campbell is a worthwhile challenge with Campbell standing at 20-3-0 and looking to win the interim WBC lightweight title so that he can face off Devin Haney. Garcia is not to be taken lightly, though, after the fighter has gone 20-0 undefeated, and he has taken on some pretty serious opponents.</p>

<p>Tale of the Tape: Garcia vs Campbell</p>
<p>Ryan Garcia Bio &amp; Record Luke Campbell 22 Age 33 5′ 10″ Height 5’9″ 70″ Reach 71″ Orthodox Stance Southpaw 20-0-0 Record 20-3-0 85% KOs 69.57%</p>
<p>Predictions: Garcia vs Campbell</p>
<p>Ryan Garcia has been a bit of a black sheep in boxing. His promotional stunts have been a little too much and when he first reared his head in 2016, making big promises and over-praising himself on social media, Reddit made sure he is put down a notch.</p>
<p>Yet, none of the scathing criticism of the community has taken a toll on Garcia, and if anything, he has proven himself in a series of important bouts. He started very slow but was soon fighting the likes of Noe Raygoza (23-9) and Fernando Parra (32-13).</p>
<p>You may argue that none of the above are too accomplished, but their experience speaks for itself. Next, Garcia took on Jayson Velez (26-4) and he has been defeating worthwhile opponents time and again.</p>
<p>Most recently he scathed Jose Lopez (20-3), Romero Duno (21-1), and Francisco Fonseca (25-2). In just two years, Garcia has been able to defeat a number of contenders who were supposed to stop his glib talk and promotional efforts short. He is definitely on the prowl for another world title.</p>
<p>None of this has come to pass.</p>
<p>Luke Needs a Win: Odds Say Otherwise</p>
<p>The odds are not kind to Campbell who is Garcia’s senior by 11 years. Campbell is posted at (+320) against Garcia’s scathing (-400) which put the young, boastful ace as a strong favorite. Campbell’s qualities are undeniable.</p>
<p>He has clocked in more professional boxing rounds, some 154 against Garcia’s 60 or so. However, Campbell will have to stay clear of Garcia’s powerful punches lest he ends up as an addition to the 85% KO stats Garcia has been adding to generously.</p>
