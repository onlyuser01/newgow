<p>Sportradar added that it will leverage its vast network of global partners and clients to distribute this solution</p>
<p>Leading global sports technology company Sportradar announced the launch of Sportradar FanID, a brand-new solution. FanID, according to the sports tech specialist, is a unique, end-to-end first-party marketing solution that pairs the first data clean room for the sports industry with Sportradar’s proprietary marketing activation technology.</p>
<p>Sportarad FanID’s goal is to provide rightsholders and brands with personalized fan engagement in a post-third party cookie world. The launch of this solution comes ahead of the anticipated removal of third-party cookies in 2024, which will force marketers to find other ways to collect data that allow them to connect with customers.</p>
<p>Sportradar added that it will leverage its vast network of global partners and clients to distribute this solution. According to the company, FanID is powered by its proprietary data coverage and advertising technology, allowing it to deliver sports fan insights that are deeper and more contextually relevant for its partners.</p>
<p>In addition, Sportradar is already prepared for the removal of third-party cookies as its data clean room addresses the upcoming challenges by allowing multiple parties to collaborate on first-party datasets.</p>
<p>FanID Will Deliver Relevant Advertising Content at the Right Time</p>
<p>Sportradar added that FanID will allow rightsholders to truly understand what sports fans care about and enhance the value they provide sponsors. The technology specialist added that Sportradar FanID “facilitates scalable, direct engagement with fans through personalized, timely and relevant ads.”</p>
<p>Providing an insight into how the solution works, Sportradar explained that there are four steps to the FanID process – data collection, data connection, data activation and data orchestration. The first step sees rightsholders and brands embed interactive tools across their digital channels to capture first-party data. Then, collected data sets are shared in the data clean room to create comprehensive and anonymized fan profiles.</p>
<p>FanID subsequently leverages proprietary marketing activation technology to serve personalized digital advertising. Finally, content is delivered to fans at the right time and through the best channel.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s executive vice president of fan engagement, Rainer Geier, commented on the new solution. He said that the upcoming crumbling of the third-party cookie is a significant opportunity for rightsholders and brands to really understand fans and deliver digital advertising content in a seamless manner.</p>
<p>We are the industry leader and partner to many clients around the world, which has allowed us to gather the most comprehensive understanding of fan behavior and insights. Sportradar FanID is an example of how we are extending our innovative capabilities, and it will serve as a catalyst for further product innovation and increased monetization potential. Rainer Geier, EVP fan engagement, Sportradar</p>
<p>Speaking of Sportradar, the company recently extended its long-term integrity agreement with the Asian Football Confederation.</p>
