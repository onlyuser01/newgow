<p>In each of the previous three Leicester City vs West Ham matches in the Premier League, we saw the Hammers grab all three points. Are we going to see history repeating itself on Sunday, February 13?</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think there’s a strong possibility for that. They’ve given the role of the favorite to David Moyes’ boys. Still, given the fact that the game is played in Leicester, winning isn’t going to be easy. In fact, it’s very likely we’ll witness a real thriller on the pitch of King Power Stadium.</p>

<p>No Jamie Vardy, Who’s Gonna Score for Leicester?</p>
<p>Leicester’s top-scorer in the Premier League, Jamie Vardy, is out with an injury. Actually, he’s been out since the start of the year, missing all five of his team’s games in 2022. With their scoring machine out, the Foxes weren’t able to score much.</p>
<p>Sure, they did put away four goals against Watford in the FA Cup on January 8, but since then, their offensive performances dropped. Since that win, we saw them score just four goals in as many matches.</p>
<p>Zambian forward Patson Daka scored two of those goals, putting his name on the lips of Leicester fans. He’s the man they’re hoping to lead the team to a good result on Sunday. Daka might have what it takes to score against West Ham, but the trouble is that the offense isn’t Leicester’s only weakness.</p>
<p>This team also has serious problems at the back, with three of their defenders struggling with fitness – Timothy Castagne, Jonny Evans, and Ryan Bertrand.</p>
<p>The Hammers Want to Stay in the Top 4</p>
<p>With 40 points after 24 rounds, West Ham is sitting in the #4 position. That’s where this team would love to stay at the very end of the season, as it would mean booking the ticket to the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history.</p>
<p>The trouble is that there are two teams just behind West Ham, with only one point fewer – Arsenal and Manchester United.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for West Ham, Arsenal has played two games fewer, while Man United is playing its 24th game of the season on Saturday. What this means is that both of these teams can easily leapfrog the Hammers.</p>
<p>This goes especially if West Ham fails to beat Leicester. The Hammers do have the manpower to win on Sunday, but their form is far from impressive. After losing two straight EPL games – against Leeds and Man United – West Ham returned to the winning track a week ago.</p>
<p>That’s when we saw the Hammers beat Watford 1-0. Still, that’s not a very good result, considering that the Hornets are a team from the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it seems that the most likely outcome of Sunday’s Leicester vs West Ham clash is a draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Leicester and West Ham to Draw; Under 2.5 Goals</p>
