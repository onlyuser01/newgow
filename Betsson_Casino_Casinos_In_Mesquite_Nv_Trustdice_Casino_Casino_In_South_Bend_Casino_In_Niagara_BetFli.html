    <h1>Betsson Casino Casinos In Mesquite Nv Trustdice Casino Casino In South Bend Casino In Niagara BetFli</h1>

<p>Unfortunately I am another person who has fallen into the Betflip trap.</p>
<p>I have created my account without any inconvenience, carry out the identity verification before making my first deposit. I received the Email from Betflip in which they informed me of the approval of the documents and the total verification of my account, so it was that I decided to make my first deposit of 1000usd. In total I did not make more than 10 bets on different sports and with a bit of luck I won some of them for which the site decided to lower my betting limits to only 10 usd, these limits are not what I look for in a betting site then I decided to withdraw my money and go elsewhere. The nightmare begins when I request my first withdrawal and after a couple of hours it is rejected, I contact support and they tell me that I need to send a selfie of myself holding my ID, I instantly sent that documentation and since then they never answered me in the chat live as well as via email, I simply lost 100% of the communication with the site. Since July 15 I have made more than 10 withdrawal requests and all of them have been rejected and I do not know the reason. I have many transcripts of the chats and also some screenshots to attach if necessary.</p>
