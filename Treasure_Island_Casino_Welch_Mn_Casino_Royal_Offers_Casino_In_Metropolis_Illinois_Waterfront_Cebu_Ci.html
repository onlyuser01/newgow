<p>CT Interactive is expanding its presence in the regulated iGaming market in Europe with the company teaming up with MondoGaming, a prominent operator in the Italian gaming market. Moving forward, CT Interactive will provide MondoGaming with 20 games. CT Interactive head of business Milena Tsankarska commented on the partnership and welcomed the opportunity, saying:</p>
<p>Our strategic plan is to increase our market share in Italy, and we find MondoGaming as the perfect operator for this goal. We are confident that this is the start of a long and prosperous partnership. CT Interactive head of business Milena Tsankarska</p>
<p>CT Interactive CEO Lachezar Petrov was similarly pleased with the development. He noted that the supplier has been licensed to provide games in Italy since 2021 and has been looking to collaborate with prominent names in the country’s fast-developing iGaming markets.</p>
<p>“This shows that our products are well-received there and we are very proud of that fact,” Petrov said. MondoGaming CEO Matteo Dimatteo was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that the whole company was excited to be bringing products by CT Interactive.</p>
<p>This is not the first market entry for CT Interactive in Italy as suggested by Petrov. In fact, the supplier has already teamed up with other prominent names from the iGaming market in the country, including Microgame. As such, CT Interactive has brought a number of excellent titles to what the company has described as a “key market” for the company.</p>
<p>Banana Party, 40 Mega Slot, Chilli Fruits, and so many others are all part of the games that are available in Italy. Meanwhile, CT Interactive has been pushing to bring more titles to this strategic market and managed to certify 10 jackpot games for Italy in November. Among the games were Hot Luck, 20 Roosters, Wizard Blizzard, and many others.</p>
<p>CT Interactive has also been present in other European markets, including Spain, Slovakia, and more.</p>
