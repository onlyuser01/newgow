<p>Sportsbooks Celebrate the Return of the NHL with Generous Refund Feature on Overtime Games</p>

<p>The NHL returned to action Saturday night after several months of inactivity due to the lack of a collective bargaining agreement between the players and owners. A deal was finally hammered out less than two weeks ago, and with the need to get a shortened season started immediately, training camps were limited to just one week, with no exhibition games between teams, and the start of the real playing fast tracked.</p>
<p>It was a sad state of affairs for the NHL, its players, and its fans, coming off a season that saw the league earn record revenues. And as with most sports league strikes, itâ€™s uncertain how the fans will react to the return of the game. Many fans declared they were done with the league, and would no longer support it with their time or dollars. However, the same scenario has been played out through several North American sports strikes, and the fans always tend to come back in relatively short order and leave the league no worse off than it was previously.</p>
<p>That potential loss of fans however does not just impact the NHL, but also sportsbooks like GEObet.com. In an effort to ensure that their hockey wagering customers return to following, and wagering, on the sport, the online casino, poker, and sportsbook operator is giving their players a generous refund feature on any wager made on a Canadian-based team this season.</p>
<p>Whenever a Canadian team, of which there are 7, loses a game in overtime or a shootout, GEObet.com will fully refund their wager. Considering that as many as 25-30% of NHL games went into overtime last season, this is no idle gesture from the sportsbook, but one that will result in many refunds being paid out. If any hockey wagerer needed some extra incentive to get back into the sport this season, that may be just the ticket to do so.</p>
<p>It should be noted however that the maximum refund per game is $50, so any wagers larger than that would not be fully refunded. To claim their refunds, players simply need to email support @GEObet.com concerning the wager in question, and their account will be credited with the refund within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Anyone who already plays casino games or poker through GEObet.com will be pleased to know that the site offers an integrated wallet between those portals and their sportsbook, so account money can be used for any activity on the site.</p>
