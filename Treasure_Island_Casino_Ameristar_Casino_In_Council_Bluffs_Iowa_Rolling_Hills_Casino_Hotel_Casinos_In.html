<p>The Forbidden Tomb Slot Review</p>
<p>Enter The Forbidden Tomb, the coveted end goal and admittedly the end of many treasure-hunters. In this Nucleus Gaming slot game, you will immerse yourself in the accursed world of Ancient Egypt and the long-lost burial sites of the civilization’s mighty rulers. The game comes with 75 paylines, a max win of 300, and an RTP of 96.08%, to bring you feature-rich gameplay that hides some clever surprises along the way.</p>
<p>A highly thematic title, The Forbidden Tomb can be played for real money or as a free game in the demo above. You will enjoy unique gameplay powered by a motley bunch of subtly crafted mechanics and designer decisions that set you in an adventuresque spirit right from the get-go.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: A Lush Hidden City Welcomes You</p>
<p>Forget about arid deserts and a parched landscape. The Forbidden Tomb is set among lush vegetation and water basins that sustain its vibrancy under the basking sun of Ancient Egypt. The game is a highly polished experience with a really strong visual presence.</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb will use a few features and animated symbols that will be constantly beckoning at you, while they set the mood and help you figure out the plot. You are on a journey to enter the treasure-filled chamber of a dead pharaoh, but as you go along, you will be offered various tributes in the form of payouts as if as a supplication to stop you right there.</p>
<p>The visuals are rich and crispy, with each symbol carefully wrought out by the designer crew to make it distinguishable and memorable. There is a holographic pyramid that counts down the time it takes for Pyramid Relic Symbols to transform themselves into Wild Symbols.</p>
<p>You won’t garner much else about the plot of the game, other than the fact that The Forbidden Tomb is a slot shrouded in mystery, making it all the more compelling and worth exploring.</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Moving on, the symbols! The Forbidden Tomb has not spared much effort in crafting a visually appealing game and part of this has to do with taking familiar and cool objects and stylizing them to fit the design style of Nucleus Gaming in general.</p>
<p>As such, there are low-paying symbols which are letters and numbers in a slightly Egyptian cursive, and a lot of high-paying symbols that are meant to be more committed to the specific setting. For example, there is an Ankh, a Parchment, a small locket shaped like a Pyramid, a Scarab, The Book of Dead, and an occult mirror from where a Dead Pharaoh with beady eyes looks back at the living.</p>
<p>Each of these symbols, along with the hovering symbol mechanic makes the game stand out visually. The symbols tend to pay a bit less with a max bet usually fetching you $60 for five Occult Mirrors, which is the game’s highest-paying symbol. This is not an issue, as other mechanics will strengthen the payout and send you in pursuit of great riches, even under the penalty of being afflicted with a deadly curse.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Visually and in terms of audio elements, The Forbidden Tomb is without a blemish. The game is almost too rich when it comes to design elements that focus on creating different experiences for players, from the special bonus game that runs in count-down rounds of 10 to the MYSTIC COMPASS and Wild Symbols that populate the reels.</p>
<p>Every element of the gameplay is presented in a neat and dedicated way that helps immerse you into the game and the pursuit of high-paying symbols so much more worthwhile. Let’s take a look at the actual gameplay and see what The Forbidden Tomb has to offer beyond its neat visuals.</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay here is very easy, and you will have an easy time from the start. With 75 paylines and an intuitive balance, you can adjust the size of the bet without any downtime and move quickly across the reels. Players are free to bet anything between $0.20 and $20 which is standard for Nucleus Gaming titles, and benefit from extra features such as Bonus Buy.</p>
<p>You can pay an amount that is based on your current running bet size and unlock 15 free spins and a number of Pyramid Relics which will help you potentially win more while you play. Other than that, you can pre-load up to 1,000 pre-paid spins and kickback. We strongly recommend picking a smaller number, however.</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb Features: Bonus Game, Wilds, and More</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb stands out by the clever way in which it awards Wilds. There is no unnecessary anticipation as once a ten-round countdown is triggered; players get to enjoy lots of neat mechanics. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>Mystic Compass Device: The Forbidden Tomb features a ten-round countdown during which you will get Pyramid Relics across the reels. A special Mystic Compass Device will convert individual symbols into Relics, which will in turn into Wilds once the countdown reaches 0, awarding a payout.</p>
<p>Free Spins: The game naturally features free spins which are accessed through the Tomb Bonus Symbol which will trigger 15 free spins. This round is played with 5, 7, or 10 free wild symbols anywhere on the reels, which will nudge around after every spin.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Curse or No Curse, Riches Await</p>
<p>Nucleus Gaming has a reputation for building excellent games and this is a fact. The Forbidden Tomb is no different, delivering a wholesome experience that pivots around a well-picked thematic yarn.</p>
<p>The Forbidden Tomb is a slot game that feels and plays fun as both real money and free instant no download game, with plenty of cool features and a great designer decision that helps set it apart. If you are a fan of Egyptian-themed games with a touch of mysticism, this one is a good fit for you!</p>
