<p>Hoot Loot review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around whimsical forest animals.</p>
<p>Set in a dark forest, players will be in the company of a range of furry friends, from a sleepy-looking porcupine to a friendly moose.</p>
<p>Other symbols include glowing mushrooms, paw prints and – of course – the charming owl eyes of the Hoot Loot. The mood is mischievous, as if the animals won’t quite give a straight answer when asked the way out of the forest.</p>
<p>The vibe will remind players of classic children’s cartoons, and they’ll definitely want to be in a youthful headspace to play.</p>
<p>Big win in the Hoot Loot slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A series of cheerful notes play as the reels spin. When players win, a series of whimsical cartoon sound effects zing. This feels right on theme, though players who aren’t in the mood for the sugary music may wish to turn the sound off.</p>
<p>The animation of the cartoon animals brings to mind the style of Looney Tunes. With bulging eyes and impish expressions, they seem good natured and silly.</p>
<p>The evergreen trees that surround the reels reinforce the sense that players are in the depths of a forest. The starry sky above adds a festive feeling, as if everyone is up a little past their bedtime.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Hoot Loot is a five reel, three row slot, with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is quite classic, and players will find what they expect with the exception of some bonus details (see below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears only on reels 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol also initiates the Hoo’s Safe Bonus. During this feature, players may choose a Scatter symbol to reveal a reward. Every reward will be 5-25 times the player's initiating bet. The feature concludes when there are no picks remaining.</p>
<p>Players receive the win sum of the credits awarded at the end of the features.</p>
<p>The Hoot Line Feature is a separate bonus payline. It is made up of Hoot Line symbols which may be in any location on the reels (from left to right).</p>
<p>The Hoot Line Multiplier (x22) is applied to Hoot Line wins and the bet per line.</p>
<p>Win with the Hoot Line feature is multiplied by 22</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95%, decisively below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€400 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a bad match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility and games with better RTP.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, medium volatility forest animal-themed slot. Its RTP is simply too low for this game to be advisable.</p>
<p>Though cute, the cartoon animals do not make up for the poor strategy stats of this game.</p>
