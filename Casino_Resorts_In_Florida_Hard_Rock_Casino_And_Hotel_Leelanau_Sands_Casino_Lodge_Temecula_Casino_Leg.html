<p>The launch of in-running betting on North American racing was facilitated via a multi-faced collaboration between the betting operator, 1/ST CONTENT and TPD</p>
<p>Last fall, Sky Bet, the leading betting operator that is a part of Flutter Entertainment, confirmed the soft launch of a new US racing-first in-running betting product in collaboration with the leading provider of premium data within the North American racing market, 1/ST CONTENT, as well as the definitive source of live data for horse racing, Total Performance Data (TPD). In what was lauded as the UK industry’s first such launch, the trial helped boost significantly customer engagement for Sky Bet.</p>
<p>Now, on Tuesday, the trio announced they expanded their collaboration, resulting in the delivery of a new in-play service. While US-facing companies have already benefitted from the solution, it is now available via Sky Bet as well, delivering unique experiences for sports fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the betting company explained that it is excited to join forces with TPD and 1/ST CONTENT for the delivery of the first automated in-play solution within the regulated market. The spokesperson explained that within the betting vertical, seamless and fast delivery of data provides efficiencies for any live sports. “Our prices process the key variables in real-time, and leverage neural networks to create the best possible in-play price,” explained Sky Bet’s spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with 1/ST CONTENT and TPD in the States to provide the only fully automated in-play solution on the market. As with any live sport, you must have a service that keeps up in-play, harnessing the most accurate and lowest-latency data feeds to secure genuine market innovation,“ reveals a spokesperson for Sky Bet</p>
<p>The Solution Delivers Efficiency, Boosts Fan Engagement</p>
<p>Sky Bet’s spokesperson predicted that the collaboration with the two companies and the new in-play solution will help tap into new audiences and retain existing customers. The confirmation of the latest solution comes at a time when Jena Antonucci recently became the first woman to train a US Triple Crown winner last week. In light of the marquee event, Sky Bet immediately reported increased fan engagement which resulted in an improved turnover.</p>
<p>“The jury has long been in, when it comes to the significance of in-play turnover for sports betting. So, it was high time racing narrowed the gap with a legitimate and robust product of its own.“ Simon Fraser, SVP international at 1/ST CONTENT</p>
<p>Simon Fraser, 1/ST CONTENT’s SVP international, spoke about the importance of in-play turnover for betting operators. Finally, he pointed out: “Working with a respected brand of Sky Bet’s scale, alongside TPD’s team of analytical experts, has allowed top-notch traders from our respective teams to finally position the missing piece in a new product for North American racing.”</p>
<p>The collaboration between TPD and 1/ST CONTENT delivers unique benefits for partner operators that can tap into different quick-fire betting opportunities, resulting in increased fan engagement. Those solutions help cover more than 1,500 racing events annually and that number is continuously growing. Additionally, partner operators can benefit from low-latency fair-margin features and extended betting windows.</p>
