<p>The castling at the top of 888 Holdings continues with Sean Wilkins now confirmed as the company’s incoming Chief Financial Officer, who will be stepping into the position on February 1, 2024. This will allow the executive to acclimatize to 888 Holdings’ operations and step in prepared into the company’s day-to-day, tasked with running its financials.</p>
<p>His appointment comes at an important time for 888 Holdings, with the group passing the reins of its Chief Executive Officer from Lord Mendelsohn to Per Widerström, the company’s new man at the helm, who will step in on October 16, 2023.</p>
<p>These changes will put 888 Holdings in a strong position in 2024, with the executives focusing on strengthening global operations. As to Wilkins, he is no chance pick, as he has years of experience holding various CFO positions across both private and public companies.</p>
<p>He has served at Superbet, and he has worked with consumer-facing businesses, such as Domino’s Pizza Group PLC, O2 Asia, Tesco Telcom, and others, all affirming his executive nous and knowledge of his subject matter.</p>
<p>A smooth passage has been guaranteed with the incumbent CFO, Yariv Dafna, handing over the reins to the group’s Chief Strategy Officer, Vaughan Lewis, who will temporarily fill in the position of CFO as well.</p>
<p>The group’s Executive Chair, Mendelsohn, who is temporarily taking care of the responsibilities of a chief executive, has welcomed the appointment of Witkins to the group. He said that the man’s appointment came after the group had conducted a very thorough and careful search process to ensure that the person coming into the job was the right fit.</p>
<p>Mendelsohn did not miss to bring up the arrival of Winderström, who together with Witkins, would give the group what it has always wanted – an outstanding executive team that will help it push forward with its strategic plans and priorities. The Executive Chair similarly thanked Dafna for his service and orderly transition of responsibilities.</p>
<p>As to Wilkins, the man himself is excited to be joining 888 and to assume the responsible position."The Board has set out very clear plans to create significant shareholder value and I am really looking forward to being part of the leadership team to deliver these plans and achieve the Group’s clear potential," Wilkins added, confident in the success of the company under his guidance and its potential to deliver on ambitious targets.</p>
