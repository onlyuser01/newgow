<p>Dear Casino Guru</p>
<p>I communicate the day of the date to file a new complaint against the casino Stake. Previously, I had a problem related to being able to deposit into a self-excluded account, but the problem was fixed thanks to Stake and the Casino Guru forum.</p>
<p>My problem now is that (before the last complaint filed) I was able to deposit into my account after having previously requested self-exclusion, since I had lost 1400 USDT and had decided to put a stop to it. According to my email, the self-exclusion was requested on September 26, 2022 and I established the self-exclusion period on September 27, 2022. I did not include this in the previous complaint, since I did not remember which account the deposits were linked to, but With the help of Stake, they told me that it was linked to the same account that I previously complained about.</p>
<p>I was in contact with Stake to sort out this refund as well, but first of all, they told me that there were no deposits after the date my self-exclusion was set (Sep 29, 2022), which was false, as I noticed in the withdrawal history of my binance account and the date was October 1, 2022, two days after my self-exclusion was established.</p>
<p>I explained this to them and they replied that on September 28, 2022, the 24-hour cooling-off period had already passed and I confirmed the permanent self-exclusion on October 1, 2022, which was not so consistent either. Then they added that on October 1, 2022 I made a withdrawal from my Stake account and therefore I was aware that the account was still open. My withdrawal was between 35 USDT, which was nothing compared to what I had deposited, and I withdrew it to at least "have some savings".</p>
<p>So, first of all, I think that the 24-hour cooling-off period was useless, because I wanted to permanently exclude myself right away, I didn't want to wait 24 hours, it seemed unnecessary to me, and even more so when it comes to an addiction, two hours can go by And I can continue wanting to bet for more than having lost everything.</p>
<p>My proposed solution is the refund of the deposit made, since I believe that, first of all, Stake lied saying that I had not deposited after September 29, 2022 (I attach evidence), and, furthermore, that the cooling-off period did not work for me. and, because of that, I was able to deposit almost 1700 USDT and lose it, I only withdrew 30 USDT.</p>
<p>I hope that Stake can take the case seriously and resolve it in the best possible way, as was the case with my last complaint.</p>
<p>I leave attached all my evidence, although it does not let me attach all of them due to the limit of links, any other information you need let me know.</p>
