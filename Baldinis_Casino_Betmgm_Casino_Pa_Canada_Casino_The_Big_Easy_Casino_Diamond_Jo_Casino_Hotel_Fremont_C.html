<p>An agreement between FanDuel and Boyd Gaming will see the sportsbook at Fremont Hotel Casino in Nevada rebranded as a FanDuel Sportsbook, claims a report in The Nevada Independent.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the FanDuel Brand</p>
<p>The agreement between Flutter-owned FanDuel and Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming, which also owns 5% of FanDuel, would rebrand the retail sportsbook at Fremont but operations at the location would remain with Boyd.</p>
<p>The deal with Boyd, which also runs retail and mobile sports betting on its own in the company’s land-based casinos outside of Nevada and via the Boyd Sports brand across its 10 casinos in Las Vegas, does not include an approval to allow FanDuel to launch mobile operations but is likely to be added later on.</p>
<p>According to sources unnamed by the media, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB)’s agenda this month includes a license for FanDuel to launch mobile sports betting and finally allow the nation’s leading sports betting operator to announce its entry in the state.</p>
<p>Responding to the media’s request for comments, Boyd Gaming spokesman David Strow outlined Boyd’s belief that the FanDuel Sportsbook “would be a great addition to the Fremont and the downtown area,” adding that the company would share more details on the agreement once the regulatory approval is obtained.</p>
<p>An email sent to Flutter Entertainment corporate offices in London was left with no response while a spokesman for the sports betting operator in New Jersey replied by email stating that he cannot comment on regulatory matters.</p>
<p>Paving Its Return to Nevada</p>
<p>FanDuel, which operates sports betting in 15 states out of 30 with legalized and regulated wagering on sports, was present in Nevada until October 2015, offering residents of the Silver State fantasy sports contests.</p>
<p>Following the ban on unlicensed fantasy sports operations by Nevada regulators, FanDuel left the state but is likely to return now. According to data in the past three months, FanDuel has a 46.6% market share nationwide.</p>
<p>And Boyd Gaming sees FanDuel as an “important strategic asset that will grow in value,” according to the company’s chief executive officer Keith Smith, hinting that the sportsbook rebranding deal may expand into Boyd Gaming-run casinos elsewhere.</p>
<p>Freemont Hotel Casino is one of Boyd’s downtown properties and is currently undergoing renovation to expand the casino and introduce several new restaurants. The $50 million project is expected to complete by the end of 2022.</p>
