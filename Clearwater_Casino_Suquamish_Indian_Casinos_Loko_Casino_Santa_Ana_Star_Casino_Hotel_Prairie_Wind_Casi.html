    <h1>Clearwater Casino Suquamish Indian Casinos Loko Casino Santa Ana Star Casino Hotel Prairie Wind Casi</h1>

<p>When I cashes out the 1500.00 it was available for cash out. The bonus was 25.00 that I had recived when I put 50.00 on the game. When I cashed out the 1500.00 I was expecting the 1500.00 if I wasnt going to recive the 1500.00 then I should not have been able to withdrawal it. At the time I had 3000.00 but was only able to withdrawl 500.00 at a time up to 1500.00. How is someone suppose to know what they will get when they withdrawal. And if that's the case why wasn't the 1375.00 put back in my bank so I could continue playing. I put more money in then what the bonus was, so technically I should have received at least half of the winning. If the 50.00 that I put in ment nothing then why did I even have to make a deposit if all I was going to get back was 5 times the amount of the bonus. If I'm not reciving the 1500.00 then I would like the 1375.00 put back in my back considering my 50.00 helped more then the 25.00 bonus to get that to 1500.00. I have played many casino and I have never seen one allow you to withdrawal then tell you you lost it all and take it away like it never happened. Another casino shows you what you are allowed to withdrawl. There was nothing telling me that when I do the withdrawal I would only recive 125.00 and loose erything else. When they first messaged me after the withdrawal and said that they had debited 1375.00 I actually thought 125.00 was left from the bonus and put back in the account and that I was reciving 1375.00 because that would have made sence. So I went and played the 125.00 while waiting for my paper work for the deposit of 1375.00 to be done. This is the worst gaming site I have ever played and the least trusting site. So I'm assuming people are suppose to guess when they withdrawal what they might get, I played for many hours wasted 50.00 that had nothing to do with the winnings and lost everything. I will not put one sent into this gaming site because I don't like to see my money go into something and get a small bonus of half of what I put in taken away. I will assume that's why I was winning was because I had a bonus, and this site new I wasn't getting any of it anyway, hoping I would play it all then I would keep putting money in. But instead I was smart enough to withdrawal half ( at least I thought I was) I learned the hard way, it will not happen again because I will not spend one cent with I wild or another site related to this because when I withdrawal money that I win I won't have to worry about any email saying I don't get anything. I should have had the 1375.00 put back in my account and the 125.00 should have stayed in the withdrawal bank and sent to me when all the paper work was received for my withdrawal.</p>
