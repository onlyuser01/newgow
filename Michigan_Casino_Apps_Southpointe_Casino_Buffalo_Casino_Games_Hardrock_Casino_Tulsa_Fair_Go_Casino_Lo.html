    <h1>Michigan Casino Apps Southpointe Casino Buffalo Casino Games Hardrock Casino Tulsa Fair Go Casino Lo</h1>

<p>What are you talking about with that bullshit statement? That’s a great assumption and I can do it too. yes I know you’re a shady, scam riddled, read the fine print, bullshit excuse for a casino so in attempt to protect my own self from your complete lack of care or concern for player safety and security I took a screenshot because I wondered how far down the line it would get before someone decided to claim the opposite and suggest my conversation with said support agent never occurred. Or to dismiss it completely as you’re doing. I haven’t seen an evidence with facts that suggest I attempted to ever profit off any account other than the one I attempted to verify or how I was intentionally manipulating some flaw by creating a second account? The previous account I had opened is also opened in the same name, and any others than that I’m not aware of. It was an oversight by me because of the sheer amount of similarly shitty quickly thrown together casinos that share the look of yours, and not a deliberate or tactical move made to give myself an advantage. I was aware it was frowned upon, hence why I then tried to bring it to your attention when it came to mine, prior to ever making a deposit.... and look how that turned out. I was actively encouraged to deposit and told I didn’t have an account opened previously....so yeah I’d say that would behoove to keep a record of wouldn’t you? Or do you only keep records of accounts simply to use when you deny access and steal players money?? I mean why else would you based on your assessment right you f**king prick?</p>
<p>so if your trying to use the fact that casinos like yours have a reputation of being shady and deliberately screwing people out of there money so I wanted to have something to protect myself in the event of such occurring. Then yes very good, you have caught me. For as you probably no, in any disagreement, or legal issue, the side which can offer proof of their actions/intentions typically wins. So while yes I discovered I had previously opened an account, nobody from your company thought it was important enough to do any type of check when I brought it to their attention. Because??? Because it wasn’t an issue or barrier for you to accept money, yet you are denying me my winnings and haven’t offered a refund. So can you show one other account I deposited too or tried to profit off? Because I didn’t, nor do I know how I’d even go about that if like you say the information doesn’t match up to mine???</p>
<p>that makes even less sense than any of the other crap you’ve pulled out of your ass.</p>
<p>so since you’re going to claim bullshit and not even examine the fact that I reached out to find out if this could cause a problem for me or how to go about closing the account I found I had made in the past, and you simply don’t care...I’m going to operate on the assumption that your support staff is encouraged to lie and you’ve stolen my money. And I’ll end with the same I’d tell any other thief I encounter in my daily life. (Because if you can’t show any activity on any other account other than the one I tried to verify and eventually deposited and won on. As in , I stuck completely to the advice of support and never made any attempt to access a second account once I had established this singular account as mine...then you are a thief) so it goes without saying, but I just like to say it....please kindly go choke on some d**ks and die. Best wishes</p>
