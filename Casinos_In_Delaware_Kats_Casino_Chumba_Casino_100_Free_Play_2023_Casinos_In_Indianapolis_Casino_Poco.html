    <h1>Casinos In Delaware Kats Casino Chumba Casino 100 Free Play 2023 Casinos In Indianapolis Casino Poco</h1>

<p>so I made a couple of deposits in this casino ($500) lost it all and then they gave me cashback , with the cashback I was able to win and max it out ($1050) so I requested an withdrawal, the withdrawal was taking for ever and I decided that I wanted to play some more so I made a couple more deposits of $500 and even a deposit of $1000. I lost it all and I decided to reverse my winnings that were pending for withdrawal, with those I won $1000 and made a total of $2000 , so I requested an withdrawal for $2000.</p>
<p>Today I got this email:</p>
<p>"Dear Antonio ,</p>
<p>Please be informed that your withdrawal for amount of 550 USD out of 2000 USD has been approved and it was sent to your bank account.</p>
<p>Please allow up to 7-10 business days for the funds to reach your account.</p>
<p>Please note that you won with 210 free chip bonus. According to our Terms and Conditions, the maximum cash out of this free chip bonus is 5 times of the bonus amount. Hence, the maximum cash out of this bonus is $1050. Rest of the winnings has been deducted."</p>
<p>so they took half of my money and they only payed $550 at a time after I made deposits of $1000</p>
<p>today I’m trying to solve this on the chat and no success, I ask for my account manager and they don’t even know who he is</p>
