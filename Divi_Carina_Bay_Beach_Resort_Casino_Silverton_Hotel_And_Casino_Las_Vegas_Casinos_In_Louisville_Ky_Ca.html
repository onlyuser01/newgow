<p>Rush Street Interactive (RSI), the leading casino and online sports betting operator, and the leading B2B sports betting platform, solutions and technology provider, Kambi Group, announced they extended their successful partnership</p>
<p>On Monday, the duo unveiled they extended their sports betting technology collaboration. The partnership extension marked a natural step in the business relationship between RSI and Kambi Group.</p>
<p>RSI to Continue to Benefit from Kambi’s Technology</p>
<p>The sports betting technology deal between Kambi and RSI dates back to 2018. Back then, the duo joined forces just after the repeal of PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), which used to restrict sports betting to Nevada. Following the repeal and the initiated statewide expansion of sports betting, Kambi powered RSI’s entry into 15 different sports betting jurisdictions. States where RSI leveraged Kambi’s leading technology include major markets such as Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York. Moreover, the leading online sports betting and casino company leveraged Kambi’s technology to power its entry outside the US in jurisdictions such as Mexico, Canada and Colombia.</p>
<p>The new announcement comes on the heels of another deal inked between Kambi and Rei do Pitaco, a Brazilian daily fantasy sports operator. By leveraging leading technology from Kambi, the operator is preparing its entry into the sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>The Leading Sports Betting Technology Boosts RSI’s Expansion</p>
<p>Kambi’s CEO and co-founder, Kristian Nylén, shared his excitement about the recent announcement. He pointed out that RSI was the company’s first US-facing partner after the repeal of PASPA.</p>
<p>“RSI was the first US-based operator we partnered with post-PASPA, and it has been fantastic to witness RSI become one of the leading online gaming players in the Americas.“ Kristian Nylén, CEO and co-founder at Kambi</p>
<p>At the same time, Nylén acknowledged that RSI has grown to a leadership position within the online gaming and sports betting market in the US and beyond. Now, according to him, the extended partnership will help RSI further and continue to bring benefits to the company in the future.</p>
<p>“This contract extension ensures Kambi’s sportsbook will continue to complement RSI’s proprietary technology and platform, which together will provide the basis for even greater success in the future,“ added Nylén</p>
<p>Thanks to the extended deal, RSI will continue to leverage Kambi’s award-winning sportsbook engine. The solution helps with the operator’s growth and is implemented within its online gaming platform. Thanks to the new deal, RSI will further benefit from the leading solution as it enters emerging markets.</p>
