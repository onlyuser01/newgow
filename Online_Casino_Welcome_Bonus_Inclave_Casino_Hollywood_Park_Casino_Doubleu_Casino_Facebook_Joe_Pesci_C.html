    <h1>Online Casino Welcome Bonus Inclave Casino Hollywood Park Casino Doubleu Casino Facebook Joe Pesci C</h1>

<p>Sports betting and iGaming brand of MGM Resorts and Entain BetMGM announced a multi-year deal today to become the preferred sports betting partner of Audacy across all sports broadcast stations, digital platforms, BetQL app, and BetQL Audio Network of the formerly known as Entercom Communications radio and podcasting company.</p>
<p>“Audacy is a leader in sports radio, digital audio and now the direct-to-consumer betting analytics space.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Content Integration, Customer Acquisition, Talent Endorsement</p>
<p>The terms of the deal encompass BetMGM content integration across Audacy’s sports broadcast stations, opportunities in customer engagement and acquisition, as well as talent endorsement for the entire range of the media’s local and national sports betting content.</p>
<p>“The advent of legalized mobile sports betting has presented an unprecedented opportunity to bring the action closer to the audience than ever before and, as a result, provide our partners with a direct line of sight to tap into an attentive, fully engaged audience of potential sports bettors.” Mike Dee, President, Sports, Audacy</p>
<p>QL Gaming Group, a sports data and iGaming affiliate platform acquired by Entercom Gommunications in November 2020, and the subsequent launch of the BetQL Audio Network this year represent fundamental components of the deal between the leading betting and gaming brand and the radio and broadcast company.</p>
<p>“In light of our BetQL acquisition and related offerings, we believe this commitment is the latest validation that no other media company offers the wide variety of ways to connect with the sports betting audience the way that we do on a multi-platform basis.” Mike Dee, President, Sports, Audacy</p>
<p>Unrivalled Audience Reach</p>
<p>Also today, the broadcast company announced it went through a rebranding, as according to the company’s chairman, president and CEO David Field, “The name Entercom no longer fit. We’ve outgrown it”, and seeking to establish consistency across B2B and B2C businesses, Entercom decided to change its name to Audacy with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The number 1 sports radio ownership group with 39 all-sport stations across the US and content reaching nearly 30 million sports fans monthly, as well as home of 41 professional teams and over 50 Division 1 collegiate programs, has audience access unrivaled by any of its competitors.</p>
<p>“In Audacy, we’ve found a long-term strategic partner that shares our goals, enabling us to further amplify BetMGM’s reach to sports fans through the most trusted audio personalities and sports betting data and analytics platform in their respective markets today.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Present across 10 US jurisdictions and available for both Android and iOS mobile operating systems and accessible via desktop, the BetMGM app features an array of personalization options to offer user-friendly betting experiences, including opportunities for players to redeem gameplay via MGM Resorts’ M life Rewards program.</p>
