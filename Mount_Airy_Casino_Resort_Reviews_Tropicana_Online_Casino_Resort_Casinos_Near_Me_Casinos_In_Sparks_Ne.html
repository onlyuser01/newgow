<p>A number of new bills have been submitted to the Verkhovna Rada in Ukraine to offer alternative to the proposed gambling plans revealed in October.</p>
<p>Six New Bills Arrive in Ukrainian Parliament</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Parliament will have to go through a slew of bills, and specifically six bills and two draft amendments related to the future regulation and taxation of gambling in the country.</p>
<p>Backed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, the push to legalize gambling in the country has intensified.</p>
<p>The newly-submitted bills will act as a counterweight to the measures introduced by the People Party in October. As to the new proposals, they all focus on establishing a regulatory framework for gambling, with minor differences.</p>
<p>As per the bills, the segments included in the would-be legislation include:</p>
<p>Online gambling</p>
<p>Sports betting</p>
<p>Lotteries</p>
<p>Casinos</p>
<p>Land-based activities will be hosted at three and five-star venues, depending on the segment a would-be license holder is applying for.</p>
<p>Tarasenko Wants to Protect UA Gamblers from Harm</p>
<p>According to the submission of Taras Tarasenko, one of the authors of the recent bills, entities applying for casinos in Kyiv, the capital, would need to pay ca $3.2 million.</p>
<p>Similarly, operators who want to run online casinos would need to pay estimated $2.1 million. Meanwhile, the bill also predicts a sportsbook licensing framework, allowing a brand to operate up to 10 betting shops across the country.</p>
<p>A total of 32 licenses are expected, with 16 focusing solely on Kyiv and 16 divvied up by other important cities in Ukraine, including Odes and Kharov.</p>
<p>Tarasenko also wants to limit the so-called ‘gambling credits,’ establishment may issue to customers to play and repay later, citing concerns about financial addiction and the risk of players’ health and livelihoods.</p>
<p>More Gambling Bills by UA Lawmakers</p>
<p>Another bill has been submitted by Roman Mulik. In the draft legislation, Mulik specifies that a license would be issued for a period of up to 10 years, extending the period from five years as outlined by other bills.</p>
<p>Oleg Marusyak has introduced an entirely different bill favoring the industry thanks to the low licensing fee, around $280,000. However, casinos in hotels will be charged at least $1.7 million for any property up to 250 rooms.</p>
<p>If a hotel exceeds 250 rooms, then the licenses needed to be paid to operate a casino on the premise goes up to $2.6 million.</p>
<p>Another bill by Oleksandr Dubinsky proposes fixed fees for all online gambling activities. All of the proposed bills outline roughly the same conditions.</p>
<p>Russia’s Own Efforts to Expand Gambling</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to the East, Russia is working on expanding gambling on its own. The country has approved developing a gambling hub in the illegally annexed Crimea peninsula.</p>
<p>Up North, Russia is already showing good signs of development in the Primorye Gambling Zone, which hosts Tigre de Cristal, a high roller casino venue.</p>
<p>Estimated 11 casinos will open doors by 2023 in the gambling zone. Meanwhile, the future of Crimea as a gambling venue is under a lot of uncertainty, as drawing tourists to the quasi-militarized region would be a major headache.</p>
