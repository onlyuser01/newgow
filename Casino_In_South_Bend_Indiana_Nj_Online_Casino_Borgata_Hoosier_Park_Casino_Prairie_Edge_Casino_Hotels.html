    <h1>Casino In South Bend Indiana Nj Online Casino Borgata Hoosier Park Casino Prairie Edge Casino Hotels</h1>

<p>I understand it all, but let me please clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Verification, or KYC (Know Your Customer/Client) is a very important and essential process, during which a casino verifies a player's identity to make sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. In order to verify the player's identity, casinos request certain documents. Casinos also have the right to request additional documents or perform an additional verification anytime.</p>
<p>Most casinos perform the verification at some point, sooner or later - some casinos do not let players make deposits before they submit documents, other casinos let players withdraw the first or few smaller withdrawals without it, but most often casinos ask for documents at the point of the first withdrawal or the first withdrawal of a higher amount.</p>
<p>There are also other factors entering the KYC process - the casino owner's residence/country, gambling license and its requirements, way of performing KYC, etc.</p>
<p>Now, I sincerely hope that all this information has sufficiently clarified why some of your previous claims are incorrect.</p>
<p>Moreover, I found this rule in the casino's Terms and Conditions (available HERE):</p>
<p>"9. Document verification criteria:</p>
<p>Photo of an identity document: all data (name, date of birth, citizenship) completely coincide with the data in Playerâ€™s details, the document is valid, with a photograph."</p>
<p>The used ID does not have an expiration date. Your ID is valid only in specific circumstances that are difficult for the casino to verify. The casino provided us with a link to a list of accepted IDs, and I also asked you about the information you have not provided me yet, twice.</p>
<p>So, yes, again - could you please answer my previously given questions regarding a different ID and check the link received from the casino and let us know if you own any of the documents from the list?</p>
<p>In case you are not willing to cooperate in resolving this issue and do not provide us with the required information, I am afraid there is nothing that we could help you with, and we will be forced to reject the complaint. We will not move forward without your cooperation.</p>
