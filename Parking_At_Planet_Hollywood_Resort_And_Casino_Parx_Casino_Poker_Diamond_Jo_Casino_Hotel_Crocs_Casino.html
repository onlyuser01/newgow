<p>A study commissioned by GambleAware and published Wednesday states that predefined deposit limit options could “anchor” players into depositing higher amounts.</p>
<p>Lower Predefined Limits to Reduce Risky Gambling</p>
<p>Allowing gamblers to set their own deposit limits, instead of choosing from a predefined list, would reduce problem-gambling behaviors, according to a study by social purpose organization Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) published Wednesday.</p>
<p>Commissioned by GambleAware in 2017 and supported by the UK Gambling Commission, the study was conducted with casino operator bet635 to explore whether behavioral tweaks could reduce risky gambling habits.</p>
<p>Deposit limits tools allow for safer wagering, as they allow players to cap the amount of money deposited on gaming platforms. However, gaming apps and websites usually display a menu of predefined amounts, with the highest limit, of up to £100,000 (about $136,000), typically at the top of the list.</p>
<p>BIT tested three deposit variations with 1,731 bet365 customers: 604 players were shown the operator’s standard deposit limits page, with options ranging from £5 to £100,000, and a “not limit option”; 571 were shown pre-defined deposit limits options with lower values, at a maximum of £250, with a “no limit” option as well; while 556 customers were shown a free text box for them to set any limit.</p>
<p>With both variations, deposit limits dropped by nearly half, compared to the usual predefined options. They decreased by 46% with the free text box option, and by 45% with the predefined list with smaller values, compared to a control group.</p>
<p>🚨 New report 🚨</p>
<p>We worked with @GambleAware to see if large deposit limits pre-sets (e.g. £10,000) on online #gambling tools, 'anchor' people to set higher deposit limits for themselves💷😒</p>

<p>LCCP-Required Free Text Box Option?</p>
<p>BIT shared its recommendations and encourages all gambling operators to start using a free text box option for deposit limits and to “should conduct more tests on how best to increase the uptake of deposit limit tools – particularly around reducing friction, and onboarding new customers – and share their insights”. It also asked for this option to be required by the Gambling Commission’s Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice.</p>
<p>“Deposit limit tools should not present any anchors. Customers should be presented with a free text box with no visible or suggested minimum/maximum monetary amounts on display,” the organization said.</p>
<p>“More research funding should be – as a priority – directed towards causal evaluations (involving both new, and existing customers) that will yield insights that can be scaled across the industry,” it added.</p>
<p>In 2019, an average of 9% of players who have gamble over the previous 30 days indicated to have used a “financial limit”, according to the Gambling Commission. During BIT’s trial, less than 5% of respondents used deposit limits, although more than 70% of gamblers find deposit limit tools useful, BIT said.</p>
