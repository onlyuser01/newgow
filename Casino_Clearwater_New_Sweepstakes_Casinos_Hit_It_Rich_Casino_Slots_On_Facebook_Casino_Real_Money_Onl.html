<p>Jumbo Interactive, an Australian lottery retailer, has tapped Nigel Atkinson as its next general manager for the United Kingdom in light of an expansion push throughout new markets. Atkinson’s experience reflects Jumbo Interactive’s ambitions in the country. He will see to the day-to-day operations of the retailer’s Gatherwell subsidiary.</p>
<p>Atkinson’s experience spans several diverse positions, one at Salmon as head of customer engagement and another stint at Wunderman Thompson Commerce, where he served as a business development director.</p>
<p>The bulk of his experience comes from his time with Neoworks, an award-winning e-commerce consultancy where he worked as head of customer engagement and business development director. His combined experience spans over 20 years of various executive and managerial roles, which will help him position the lottery firm’s operations in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Helping Set Up Lotteries Quicker Than Ever</p>
<p>Through Gatherwell, Jumbo Interactive will be able to leverage its experience in running charity lotteries for the Australian government and offer it to various local and educational causes championed by schools and other organizations. As a result, charities will have quick access to a time-tested and proven lottery platform that will help them raise revenue for worthy causes.</p>
<p>As general manager for the United Kingdom, Atkinson is confident that charities can play a crucial role in generating new fundraising income. According to him, such lotteries are a low-risk and sustainable fundraising option for any organization looking to advance a just cause. In explaining Jumbo Interactive’s plans, Atkinson struck a company line, envisaging the future:</p>
<p>“We are excited to further develop our presence in the UK and make our software and services available to support more charities back into good health – whatever their size.” Jumbo Interactive UK general manager Nigel Atkinson</p>
<p>His appointment comes with an endorsement by Jumbo Interactive CCO Richard Bateson, who was pleased with Atkinson joining the team. Bateson cited Atkinson’s digital knowledge and expertise as two of the main reasons behind the decision to bring the new general manager on board.</p>
<p>Bateson further reiterated Jumbo Interactive’s position to support not-for-profit organizations with their fundraising efforts at what he described as “a very important time.”</p>
<p>Previously, Jumbo Interactive was able to report record-breaking results for fiscal 2021 ending on June 30. The company posted AUS83.3 million in revenue or roughly $60.4 million.</p>
<p>Jumbo registered strong growth in its SaaS and managed services sectors which were able to provide the company with a resilient foothold during the pandemic. This comes as an improvement on previously reported results for the first half of the fiscal year in February when profit fell despite stronger revenue and growth.</p>
