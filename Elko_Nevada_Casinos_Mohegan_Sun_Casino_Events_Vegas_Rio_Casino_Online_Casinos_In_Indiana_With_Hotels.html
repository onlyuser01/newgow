<p>The fastest-growing sports company in North America, PrizePicks, continues to expand its presence across the United States. Earlier this week, the company revealed that it expanded its presenceafter securing a temporary license in Indiana. That license enabled the company to operate its daily fantasy sports business. Thanks to the temporary license, PrizePicks expands further its footprint and enters a basketball-loving state with a promise to deliver supreme experiences.</p>
<p>Per the new license, awarded by the gambling regulator in the state, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the company can now provide its skill-based fantasy sports platform. The company anticipates its products to be well-received, considering the growing fan bases of the WNBA's Indiana Fever and NBA's Indiana Pacers.</p>
<p>Indiana State Senator Jon Ford, who is also the President of the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States (NCLGS), shared his excitement about the recent announcement in a statement. "As an author of the fantasy sports legislation in Indiana, I'm happy to see Indiana continue to be a leader in creating a successful regulatory environment for fostering innovation in the fantasy sports space," he explained.</p>
<p>Jason Barclay, PrizePicks' Chief Legal Officer and Head of Public Policy, was similarly delighted about the latest achievement. He explained: "Adding Indiana as a licensed state to our portfolio is an important benchmark for our organization as we continue to grow our national footprint."</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to the Indiana Gaming Commission for their collaboration and we hope that this license can be a model for other states with competitive gaming markets," pointed out Barclay in conclusion.</p>
<p>The temporary license secured in Indiana comes during a busy period for PrizePicks. The company recently penned a partnership with MLB's Atlanta Braves. In April, PrizePicks also joined forces with NASCAR, the premier form of motorsports in the US. That deal designated the company as NASCAR's official Fantasy Sports Partner.</p>
<p>Additional milestone achievements announced recently by PrizePicks include its deal with Meek Mill, as well as the BIG3 basketball league that is owned by the globally recognized hip-hop star, Ice Cube. Late last month, the Atlanta Association for Corporate Growth named PrizePicks as the fastest-growing company in Georgia within the upper middle market.</p>
<p>Now, expanding its presence in Indiana further complements PrizePicks' US-facing growth. Thanks to the entry into the state, the company will be able to collaborate with new audiences, delivering engaging and thrilling experiences.</p>
