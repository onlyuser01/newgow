<p>LIV Golf Singapore partnership is in line with RWS' continuous efforts to bring new and premium experiences to its visitors</p>
<p>LIV Golf Investments, a new company seeking to further unlock the hidden potential of golf worldwide, announced it has chosen Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) as its presenting partner and the official hotel of the upcoming LIV Golf Singapore.</p>
<p>Partnering with LIV Golf</p>
<p>Presented by Resorts World Sentosa, the LIV Golf Singapore at the end of April will become the fifth tournament of the 2023 season and the first visit of the league to the Asian country, with 48 of the world’s best players among which Dustin Johnson, Cameron Smith, Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau taking on the No.1 rated course in the country, The Serapong, at Sentosa Golf Club.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Tan Hee Teck, chief executive officer of RWS, outlined that the resort would bring LIV Golf to Singapore as offering new and premium experiences to its visitors is part of its DNA, adding new appeal for many of its premium visitors who are also golf enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with like-minded partners to make RWS a compelling lifestyle and leisure proposition that resonates with our target consumers with diverse interests across entertainment, food, the arts, sports, and much more. Tan Hee Teck, CEO, RWS</p>
<p>Tan Hee Teck is determined to ensure that “RWS continues to be at the forefront of Singapore’s tourism and lifestyle landscape, providing its visitors with a pipeline of specially curated thematic offerings that are second to none.”</p>
<p>Upon its return to Asia, LIV Golf Singapore presented by RWS will feature 3 days of action on one of the world’s best golf courses, The Serapong, offering fast and challenging greens, trademark contours and signature holes.</p>
<p>Asia Deserves Golf’s Best</p>
<p>LIV Golf Commissioner and CEO Greg Norman also commented on the agreement, proud to have RWS as the presenting partner for LIV Golf Singapore, an event that will bring the world’s best golfers in a market also deserving the sport’s top competition and experiences such as Asia.</p>
<p>“The LIV Golf League is changing the game and aligns with RWS’ commitment to introducing world-class entertainment to tourists and locals on the island,” Norman added.</p>
<p>Sentosa Golf Club became the first golf club worldwide to join the UN Sports for Climate Action Initiative, and less than a week ago, it received recognition as the world’s first carbon-neutral golf club, on top of being named “World’s Best Eco-Friendly Golf Facility” for the third year in a row.</p>
<p>At the 2022 World Golf Awards the club won the “Asia’s Best Golf Course” award, while the recent edition of the Asian Golf Awards hosted in Vietnam brought two other awards to the club, “Best Championship Course in Asia-Pacific” and “Singapore’s Best Golf Course.”</p>
<p>LIV Golf Singapore will be one of 14 tournaments hosted in seven countries where LIV Golf’s 12 teams compete throughout the season in pursuit of the LIV Golf League Individual Championship and Team Championship.</p>
