    <h1>Hollywood Casino Dayton Ohio Rooms At Mgm Casino Casino Near Destin Fl Alabama Casinos Casinos Tampa</h1>

<p>Hi, I signed up to jackpot.com yesterday and deposited using my Debit Mastercard I managed to win £700 and sent my ID and had an email to say my account had been successfully verified. The withdrawal was in pending and when I looked today it shows as cancelled. I went onto chat and they told me they can’t send it to my card as some banks recognise it as a fraud.. never heard as much rubbish. They told me to try an e wallet but non accept my card type so the only other option is bank transfer and I have been told to email them which I have done as a complaint. I have been using online casinos since they began and know this sort of tactic to try to get you to spend the withdrawal money. I have a few screen shots below. When I updated my payment method to bank transfer which is the only way to set it as the withdrawal method it charged me 10p they say they will let me k ow if successful.. I’m fully aware what they are trying to do and have read some abysmal reviews on the internet about exactly the same problem .. also they are registered with a valid UK licence</p>
