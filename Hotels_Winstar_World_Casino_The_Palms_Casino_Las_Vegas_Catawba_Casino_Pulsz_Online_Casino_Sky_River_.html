<p>Collaborative efforts against illegal gambling in Ukraine by law enforcement agencies resulted in the shutdown of nearly 10 venues. On Wednesday, the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine (ESBU), a strategic department that focuses on economic protection, unveiled details regarding eight raids conducted within the Kyiv region.</p>
<p>Within the operation against illegal gambling, ESBU Detectives collaborated with the National Police of Ukraine, as well as Kyiv’s regional department of Internal Security. The organizations were under the guidance of prosecutors from the Prosecutor General’s office and the operation resulted in seizing UAH 100,000 ($2,700) from seven gambling establishments and one underground casino.</p>
<p>In 2020, Ukraine greenlighted a law that enabled the operation and regulation of gambling activities. This law opened the country’s market for online gambling, including poker and casino, as well as land-based gambling via slot machines, betting and table games. However, the law provided specific guidelines for the operation of gambling businesses. As a result, four and five-star hotels were allowed to offer casino gambling, while three up to five-star hotels were allowed to position slot machines.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Seize Gambling Equipment</p>
<p>Now, in light of the recent raids, the ESBU explained that the gambling businesses offered their services which was in violation of the existing curfew. It said that the illegal businesses operated from different locations and were concealed. According to the ESBU, the gambling dens would only allow “trusted customers” after being prompted by a phone call first.</p>
<p>Besides the money, police authorities seized a large number of gambling equipment, including poker tables, cards and chips, as well as other devices. Some 100 computer sets were also seized along with documents and other necessary evidence.</p>
<p>The organization of illegal gambling activities is currently a criminal offense in Ukraine. While an investigation is ongoing, it is likely for the individuals that ran the gambling businesses to face charges under Art. 203 of Ukraine’s Criminal Code, which is related to the organization and conducting of illegal gambling activities, including lotteries.</p>
