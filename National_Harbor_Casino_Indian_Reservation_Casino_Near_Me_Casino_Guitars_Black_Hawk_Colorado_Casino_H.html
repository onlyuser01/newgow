    <h1>National Harbor Casino Indian Reservation Casino Near Me Casino Guitars Black Hawk Colorado Casino H</h1>

<p>I do understand about the rude $10 max bet, because I was nightmares with my over $38,000 had been took away from my balance when my was first time joined play with ozwin casino about the max bet rules. That’s time was my fault because I didn’t read carefully about the max bet , I was not well because that’s not a small amounts to me. Anyway I’m still continues playing with ozwin casino, and I’m very careful about the max bet. I did ask most of time whenever I bet . Once time I withdraw my winnings and I text ask my VIP manager her name is Claura sorry I can’t remember spell her name but something like that. I did ask her I’m. become VIP membership how much I can withdraw? She’s said withdraw can be $7500 per week. And I ask her how about vip membership the max bet? She’s said I don’t need to worry about the max bet anymore, I can bet what ever I want to bet , because I’m vip membership. I was very excited and i did bet $25 and I did a few times withdraw their Reno problems at all. I did deposit with bonus , i did play $25 I’m still playing withdraw winnings every times very easily because my vip manager told me I can bet any amount that’s I want even I deposit with bonus it’s no problem at all. Now what’s happening to me I’m shocking about this I’m so tired and so so stressful nightmares haven’t sleep eat drink for 3 days :🙁. Thế ra no reason for them to take my money away from my account, because I’m listening to my manager I did play the right thing. They’re make excuses they’re send me email telling me cancel my vip membership, I don’t know why? Also I did never receive any mail from them be honest. If I receive the mail I was never play the bet high, I will bet )$10 only. I’m not stupid bet $25 because I don’t want to lost my money anymore.you don’t know how I feel about this happen to me , a lot money to me and I told my daughter I will bye car for her because she’s passed her license. My daughter very happy and she’s said can’t wait for her first car. You now know how’s it my feeling? I told my daughter I wait for ozwin casino pay out🙁. So sorry to bring my family up here, once more time can I ask the ozwin casino please think about it and I need that’s 13,000 for my daughter car as soon as possible please.
