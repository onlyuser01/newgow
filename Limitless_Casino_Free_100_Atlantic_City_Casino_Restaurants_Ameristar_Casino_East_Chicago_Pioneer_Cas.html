<p>“Pragmatic Play has infused a delightful touch of festive spirit into our top-performing titles, offering players exciting gameplay fit for this time of year across their favorite games.“ Irina Cornides, COO at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Pragmatic Play forged a deal with Niké, boosting its presence in Slovakia. Under the terms of the fresh content agreement, the iGaming supplier agreed to deliver its slots products, bolstering the offering of the online gambling operator.</p>
<p>Pragmatic’s Festive Slot Comes Packed with Engaging Features</p>
<p>Sugar Rush Xmas players can expect to see symbols that represent different types of sweets, including lollipops, stars and gummy bears. With the reel presented at the center of the screen, a snowy background underlines the slot’s festive theme. Symbols that fall onto the reel are also partially covered in snow.</p>
<p>To secure wins, Sugar Rush Xmas players must form adjacent cluster of five or more symbols. Once this happens, the slot’s cascade feature is triggered, removing the winning symbols and allowing new symbols to fall onto the matrix in their place.</p>
<p>This engaging feature grants the players a chance to secure multiple wins from a single spin. Moreover, for “every win formed its position is marked, with subsequent wins in this same position providing an increasing multiplier of up to 128x,” reveals Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>Players who land three or more bauble-filled scatter symbols secure a minimum of 10 free spins. During this special bonus round, multipliers remain in their place, granting a chance for players to further boost their winnings.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game’s respin feature brings more excitement. Online players who land more scatter symbols can secure up to 30 additional free spins.</p>
