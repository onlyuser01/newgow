<p>Sportradar’s Managed Trading Services (MTS) Return Guarantee is launching on 888sport’s tennis markets. The bespoke risk management solution can be integrated with other sports, too.</p>
<p>888 Adds Sportradar’s Risk Management to Boost Tennis Markets</p>
<p>888 Holdings PLC has inked a new partnership with Sportradar, a leading software provider of sports betting and sports entertainment services and products. As per the agreement, 888 Holdings will make use of Sportradar’s risk management solution better known as Managed Trading Services (MTS) Return Guarantee.</p>
<p>The product will be used for 888’s sizeable coverage of tennis markets, reinforcing the company’s current status as a leader in providing sports betting options to fans. Sportradar will help bolster integrity across 888’s international markets and reinforce 888’s position as a global purveyor of betting solutions.</p>
<p>However, 888 is not only counting to use MTS across tennis markets, as the solution can be tailored to the needs of any sports market and meet the required service levels, an official press release specifies.</p>
<p>Sportradar uses a mix of technological solutions, including AI-derived pricing algorithms to provide sportsbooks with a better-rounded product and enhance its operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, 888 Head of B2C Guy Cohen said that the tie-up with Sportradar was an exciting opportunity to improve on the company’s tennis portfolio. Cohen further had this to say:</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing continuous improvements for all our players and look forward to a gradual rollout across our international markets.”</p>
<p>Sportradar Business Development Manager Nick Soye praised 888’s achievements in the sports betting sector. Soye called 888 an innovative and forward-thinking brand with strong ambitions and exponential global growth.</p>
<p>He spoke on behalf of Sportradar, saying that the company was excited to partner up with 888 and bring its bespoke risk management solutions to help bolster the brand and its sports vertical.</p>
<p>Soye concluded that Sportradar’s MTS would no doubt help enahnce 888sport’s overall offer and deliver the quality consumers expect.</p>
<p>888’s Remains Committed to Global Growth Strategy</p>
<p>While 888 has long been a leading European brand, company CEO Itai Pazner has confirmed that the company is looking to drive steadier inroads in the US market. Recently, 888 offered to buy up some of William Hill’s international assets.</p>
<p>Pazner acknowledged that the company hasn’t been able to complete all tasks at hand, but it has driven significant growth in key verticals, such as casino poker and sports betting, and specifically in Europe.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that 888 is still in a better position in the US in terms of iGaming than of sports betting. That is something the company would seek to fix now, securing a high-profile partnership with Sportradar to boost integrity.</p>
<p>888 also recently became an official partner for the National Football League (NFL) back in the United Kingdom. Moving forward, the company will pivot towards US sports betting while bolstering its operations elsewhere.</p>
