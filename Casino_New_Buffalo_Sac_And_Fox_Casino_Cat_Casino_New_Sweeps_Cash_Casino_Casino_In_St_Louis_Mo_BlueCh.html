    <h1>Casino New Buffalo Sac And Fox Casino Cat Casino New Sweeps Cash Casino Casino In St Louis Mo BlueCh</h1>

<p>Hello I am from Montreal, Canada. I deposited a couple hundred on this casino dec 1st. I played coin strike a slot a game and ended up winning lots and having over 40 000 in my balance on my account. I tried to withdraw but this casino put me a very tough time w the verification process.. the last step was proving to them that I deposited off my card. I sent them photos of my card but I don’t have my name on my debit card (which I used to deposit) . I explained this to their support team and they said to ask my bank. I called my bank and ordered a whole new card! In the mail and it came 7-8 days later. I’m all excited ready to withdrawal my 40 000 dollars and get my last step to verification! I try to get on my account and it’s locked. I message theyre support team and they tell me I’m suspicious to fraud.. HOW!!? I was messaging the support team the whole time. I was asking them questions and even got a whole new card custom from the mail from td bank.. like ? And they tell me I’m a suspect of fraud and I can no longer access my account.. (or my 43 000$) like how is this possible? They are the fraud. I wrote them many emails, they told me I was going to get a response from the necessary team</p>
<p>amd I haven’t heard from them in weeks. Casino guru help me it’s 40-50k.. how can they do this. I have all the proof. Videos of my account. Emails everything..</p>
