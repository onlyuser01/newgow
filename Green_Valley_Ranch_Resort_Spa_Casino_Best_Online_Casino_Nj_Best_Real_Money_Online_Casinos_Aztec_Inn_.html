<p>James Thomas has passed away at the age of 88, SBC News reported. The Hippodrome Casino LondonCo-Founder and President died in his sleep on Saturday morning at the London Clinic. He had fallen ill shortly before his passing away and is succeeded by a son and two daughters, along with seven grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.</p>
<p>His business acumen and notable contributions to the gambling sector won him the Casino Association "Lifetime Achievement Award" in 2013. Thomas was an important industry person and executive who was a member of numerous industry bodies as he pursued to innovate and improve the gambling experience for all.</p>
<p>He was involved with the British Amusement &amp; Catering Trade Association as well as the European Amusement &amp; Gaming Expo where he served as VP of the Charitable Trust and Director respectively.</p>
<p>The prominent casino figure who goes by "Jimmy" to many industry insiders was a self-made success story. He became involved with the casino business as early as 1956 when he launched his first project in the Hurst Hotel, Quorn, Leicestershire.</p>
<p>He proceeded with a second project in 1965 when he opened the La Ronde Casino &amp; Cabaret Club in Loughborough. Thomas’ flair for business allowed him to position himself as a pioneer in the industry.</p>
<p>Apart from running land-based venues, he branched off to other verticals of the business and founded Thomas Automatics Co Ltd, which would go on to become a force to be reckoned with in manufacturing equipment for the industry.</p>
<p>He moved on to bingo with Beacon Entertainments Limited, creating a new tier of social clubs and bingo halls which enabled him to pursue even bolder plans. While he had to change and adapt his business on several occasions, Thomas remained committed to the gambling industry and pursued fresh interests in it.</p>
<p>Throughout the churn of business decisions, the man founded Thomas Holdings Limited, which more or less led to the opening of the Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square, London in July 2012, ten years ago. The casino has been hailed as a game changer for the entire industry, creating new experiences and winning numerous awards.</p>
<p>Thomas may have passed away but his legacy will live on, as the Hippodrome Casino is now an indelible part of London's gambling life. The casino recently announced a partnership with OKTO to attempt a cashless payment experience which resonates with Thomas’ ambition to always innovate and improve things.</p>
