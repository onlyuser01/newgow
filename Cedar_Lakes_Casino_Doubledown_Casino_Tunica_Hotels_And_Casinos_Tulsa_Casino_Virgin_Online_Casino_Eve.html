<p>The addition of Inter Miami further expanded Venuetize's roster of sports partnerships with links to all US major leagues</p>
<p>Gaming equipment provider Everi Holdings announced today that its platform for sports, hospitality and entertainment, Venuetize, has been selected by Major League Soccer (MLS) team, Inter Miami CF, as the foundation for the club’s mobile fan engagement strategy.</p>
<p>‘Unique Match-Day Experience’</p>
<p>The partnership with Inter Miami will see Venuetize utilize its capabilities, including mobile wallet, content, ticketing integrations, sports betting, gamification, parking, in-seat delivery options, and others to enhance the club’s mobile strategy and provide its fans with a refreshed experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership, Everi’s executive vice president and FinTech Business leader, Darren Simmons, outlined the platform’s in-built capabilities “to reach club supporters wherever they are with best-in-class marketing support.</p>
<p>“Our collective goal is to deliver a unique match-day experience that engages supporters at greater levels, all while giving them a platform to directly interact with the numerous offerings from the club,” Simmons said.</p>
<p>Everi Holdings acquired Venuetize last year to expand beyond casino gaming and broaden the range of its mobile capabilities with the platform’s mobile-first technology. By that time, the roster of Venuetize partnerships included more than 50 sports teams associated with the MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, and National Women’s Soccer League, as well as multiple retail and entertainment districts.</p>
<p>Following the agreement, supporters of Inter Miami will be able to stay informed with the latest news about their favorite club and players, keep track of live scores, look at upcoming fixtures and team standings, buy and transfer match tickets, benefit from transportation and rideshare services information, as well as browse the club’s mobile store – all while using the Inter Miami CF app.</p>
<p>One-Stop Shop for Match-Day Experiences</p>
<p>Enhanced by the platform that is fast becoming the preferred choice across sports, hospitality and entertainment industries, the refreshed Inter Miami CF app will cement its place as a one-stop shop for match-day fan experiences.</p>
<p>The partnership with Everi’s Venuetize comes during exciting times for the fans of Inter Miami after the club announced that seven-time Ballon d’Or winner and captain of Argentina’s national team that won the FIFA World Cup 2022, Lionel Messi, had joined the club.</p>
<p>Messi completed a two-year stint with France’s Ligue 1 Paris Saint-Germain and chose Inter Miami, refusing a lucrative $400 million-a-year offer from Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal, as well as a proposal to return to newly-crowned Spanish champions, Barcelona, in the process.</p>
<p>This year, Everi Holdings acquired certain assets of the provider of integrated electronic bingo gaming devices and systems, Video King, in a deal that was expected to bring immediate benefits to the company’s earnings and cash flow.</p>
<p>In May, Everi Holdings marked its third consecutive year of being entered into the 2023 Nevada Top Workplaces and recognized as one of the company’s with a healthy work culture in the state.</p>
