<p>After the two parties recently signed an agreement, the new portfolio of live casino games by BETER Live will be made available to Parimatch customers. The live dealer solution will also be used by the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>Parimatch customers can now enjoy casino classics such as Roulette, Blackjack and Top Card with a live dealer. Each live studio will also have a unique design. This will allow each table to use Parimatch's branding, which will further differentiate it from other live casino products.</p>
<p>BETER Live was launched to usher in a new era for live casino. It focuses on entertainment-first gaming, high-tech and entertainment-first gaming, developed by TV production professionals and live casino operators, using cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The operators will be housed in a minimalist studio designed with great detail and lead by experienced casino dealers. They will have access to localized server deployments, a wide range of languages and high-margin sides bets.</p>
<p>Anna Vikmane, director at BETER Live, commented on the partnership, "We've worked tirelessly over the last twelve months to develop our portfolio of entertaining classic live casino games, each with their own high-tech twist.</p>
<p>"To see these games go live at Parimatch so soon after launching is a testament to all of our hard work. We can't wait to see how players receive these games in the next few weeks and months as we continue to develop innovative titles for a global audience."</p>
<p>Parimatch continues to expand its online offerings. In December, it announced the addition of Vivo Gaming's comprehensive live dealer solution. Parimatch added 27 live tables, giving customers the opportunity to play popular games such as Roulette, Baccarat and Blackjack.</p>
<p>Parimatch is available in more than 60 countries. Vivo Gaming's tables are located alongside the operator's sports betting products, primarily within the CIS and SEA.</p>
<p>Vivo Gaming has over 60 live tables on three continents and 150 customers. They stream 24/7 in Asian, LatAm and European formats. You can play baccarat and blackjack, as well as poker and Dragon Tiger, in over 27 languages, and in 178 currencies, including multiple cryptocurrencies.</p>
