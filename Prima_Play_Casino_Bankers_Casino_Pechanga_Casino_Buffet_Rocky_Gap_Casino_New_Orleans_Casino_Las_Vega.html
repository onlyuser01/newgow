<p>The proposed changes seek to protect Czech consumers from gambling harm and stop gambling-related fraud</p>
<p>The Czech Republic plans to introduce major changes to how gambling is regulated in the country. The amendments to 2017’s Gambling Act follow an earlier review and would introduce more robust player safety and crime prevention measures.</p>
<p>The original act introduced stricter regulations such as higher taxation rates for all gambling operators. The high taxes were introduced following a campaign on addictive games and substances by the republic’s Ministry of Health and the National Drug Policy Coordinator.</p>
<p>One of the most important changes in the current draft bill concerns self-exclusion. Instead of going through complex self-exclusion processes, players will be armed with a new “panic button” that will allow them to instantly exclude themselves from playing for 48 hours.</p>
<p>All licensees will be required to incorporate this functionality into their online platforms. The button will block players from playing with any legal operator, providing them with ample time to exclude themselves from gambling, if they so wish. During these 48 hours, players cannot be removed from the self-exclusion database.</p>
<p>Speaking of the database, it will now be expanded to include persons under criminal investigation.</p>
<p>ISP Blocks and Changes to the Size of License Fees</p>
<p>In addition to the new safer gambling protocols, the Czech Republic will introduce stricter internet service provider (ISP) blockings for unlicensed operators. Unlike other jurisdictions that block only companies that target their players, the Czech Republic will instead allow the blocking of all platforms and sites that offer or promote illegal gambling.</p>
<p>The bill will also change how the size of the license fee for gambling companies is calculated. A company’s appeal to customers and risk profile will be taken into mind when determining the sum.</p>
<p>In addition, the bill seeks to better categorize different gambling verticals.</p>
<p>While the Czech Republic plans to introduce a variety of new regulations, it also seeks to expand its market by legalizing new verticals. The bill will legalize live dealer games, expanding the offerings Czech players can legally take part in. Currently, online gamblers in the country can primarily enjoy slots and digital table games.</p>
<p>Despite its strict regulations and desire to introduce further restrictions, the Czech Republic remains an attractive market for gambling operators and suppliers seeking to expand their European footprint.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, GGPoker, the world’s largest online poker room, was cleared for launch in the country. The poker operator launched in the country under the GGPoker.cz domain, allowing local players to experience exciting poker games.</p>
