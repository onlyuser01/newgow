<p>Liverpool and Manchester City are the only two teams that won the English Premier League title in the previous five seasons. The Citizens won it four times, while the Merseyside Reds did it only in the 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>Before the 2022-23 season started, these two were the top two favorites for the trophy, each with odds in the ballpark of +300. Manchester City’s odds have shortened after 10 rounds of the Prem, as this is the only team in the league that’s undefeated. Meanwhile, Liverpool’s odds are way longer than they were prior to the start of the season. The Reds are now priced at +3300 at some online sportsbooks, which is no surprise knowing that they got only 10 points right now.</p>
<p>Still, the EPL run isn’t yet lost for Liverpool, especially not if they beat Manchester City on Sunday. In that case, they’re going to reduce the point gap to 10 points. More importantly, a win in Round 11 would give the Reds a massive morale boost, which is exactly what they need at this point.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp’s Boys Looking for Their First EPL Win Since August</p>
<p>Liverpool is 2-4-2 in the Premier League, with its most recent win happening on the last day of August. Since then, the Reds have played two draws and lost one EPL game. If they want to stay in the competition for the trophy (or at least, a top 4 finish), they need to start winning again ASAP.</p>
<p>The bad news is that this weekend they’re playing against arguably the strongest team on the planet. The good news is that the situation in their locker room is good after a huge win in the Champions League earlier this week.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Liverpool destroyed Glasgow Rangers on the road 7-1 with Mohamed Salah scoring a hat-trick in just over 20 minutes on the pitch. Speaking of Salah, last season’s EPL top scorer has scored just two goals in the 2022-23 Premier League so far, both of which happened back in August. Maybe Sunday is when he makes his comeback to the scoresheet?</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Manchester City Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real battle on the pitch with both teams giving their utmost. Liverpool tends to do great at home, as evident from the fact that this team’s lost only two games to Manchester City at Anfield in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>We don’t think Liverpool is going to lose on Sunday, but we’re not 100% sure the Reds can win. Instead, a draw seems like the most probable outcome. What we’re sure of the most is that this game is going to be packed with goals on both ends. Over 3.5 seems like a banker.</p>
<p>Picks: Draw: over 3.5 goals</p>
