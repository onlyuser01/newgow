    <h1>Casinos Minnesota Aurora Hollywood Casino Line Casinos Hotel Casinos Wind Creek Casino Wetumpka Bet7</h1>

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I made a deposit more than 24 hours ago by mbway! So far it hasn't appeared available on the account to be able to play, the chat worked yesterday and what they told me is that the provider still hadn't processed it! It happens that they use mbway, but not in a normal way... they have an intermediary who is SKRILL! I already had skrill and I have my account closed with them since I refused to send my bank account details for the last 6 months! That's what was missing, for them to know more than my family!</p>
<p>what seems to me is that this mbway method is not normal... we pay to skrill and they are the ones who put the money in the game. It seems to me that the problem is there, it is having a closed account in skrill! But I didn't deposit by skrill, I deposited by MBWAY! MBWAY should have nothing to do with skrill! In the chat no one is present, and by email they do not respond!</p>
