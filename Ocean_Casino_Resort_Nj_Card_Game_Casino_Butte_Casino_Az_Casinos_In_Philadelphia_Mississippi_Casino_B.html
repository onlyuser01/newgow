<p>Esports Technologies will host an exclusive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Tournament during the SiGMA expo held at the Malta Fairs &amp; Conventions Center from November 15 through November 19. The event, aptly dubbed, Sigma Esports Technologies Cup, will pit retired or highly-regarded legends of the game against some of the most talented present-day competitors. The event will be held at the Sigma Esports Village’s dedicated arena.</p>
<p>The winners will get to win prizes out of a $15,000 tournament purse and secure bragging rights that they “still got it,” or at the very least, that they are the future of the game. A total of eight teams have been invited with the likes of Astralis Talent, SAW Youngsters, and Eversio.</p>
<p>Esports Technologies will enter the race with a wildcard team which will be led by Emil “HeatoN” Christensen. HeatoN is a prominent figure in the Counter-Strike community, having served as a captain of Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP), a Betway-sponsored esports powerhouse.</p>
<p>As the SiGMA expo nears, competitors in the upcoming event are already fighting in closed qualifiers hosted by HLTV through November 6. Two more teams will be joining the ones in Malta through the qualifiers.</p>

<p>Esports Technologies will also be hosting an esports workshop where attendees can find out more about the future of esports, which is valued at $20.7 billion by 2027 according to a study by Valuates Reports. Commenting on the upcoming events, Esports Technologies CMO Mark Thorne had this to add:</p>
<p>“We are excited to be participating so prominently in this year’s SiGMA Europe, one of the truly elite events in the world of gaming. This event reflects well on Malta’s emergence as an international hub for the esports industry.” Esports Technologies CMO Mark Thorne</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SiGMA Group founder Eman Pulis has described the upcoming event as the company’s biggest to date and one where esports will play a pivotal role in the industry. Pulis is happy that SiGMA can introduce esports to more people.</p>
<p>Previously, Esports Technologies announced that it is opening a new office in Malta. Earlier this week, the company confirmed that it would seek to acquire a betting exchange system patent as well.</p>
