<p>The leading betting and iGaming company with a strong presence across Australia and North America, PointsBet, released its Q1 FY24 activities report, sharing insights regarding its performance for the latest trading period.

This result, when compared to the corresponding period in FY23, marked a slight 3% decrease.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after earlier this year, PointsBet agreed to sell its US assets to Fanatics. Initially, Fanatics proposed $150 million for PointsBet’s US operation, a bid that was later surpassed by an offer from DraftKings that was $195 million. However, in the end, Fanatics acquired PointsBet’s US operations in a deal for $225 million. The latest report is the first one that excludes its US-facing operations.</p>

<p>Providing a breakdown of the total net win, PointsBet revealed that its sports betting operations in Australia saw an uptick of 11% to AU$52.8 million ($33.5 million) in net win. In contrast to the positive result, the betting handle in Q1 FY24 for Australia decreased by 7% to AU$566.9 million ($359.5 million).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company’s betting operations in Canada saw AU$44.2 million ($28 million) in turnover for Q1 FY24, a result that represents an increase of 111%.
