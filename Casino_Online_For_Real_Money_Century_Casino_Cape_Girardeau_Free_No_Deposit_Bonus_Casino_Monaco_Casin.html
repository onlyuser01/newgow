    <h1>Casino Online For Real Money Century Casino Cape Girardeau Free No Deposit Bonus Casino Monaco Casin</h1>

<p>Hi , I have been one of the very loyal players of this casino . Though many times I faced withdrawal issues with them , but it use to get sorted after chasing them and talking to their customer support for 10 times in a day , and literally begging they would process withdrawals . If any existing players have seen their leaderboard then my name in all their leaderboard till date has featured in top 3 (ishXXXX@XXXail.com)</p>
<p>my every day average deposit with them has been in range of minimum 50 k - 200 K . And last 15 - 20 days I was continuously loosing , however this week luck was on my side . On Monday , I won 300 K , then Wednesday 400k (Both withdrawal got processed ) , now here 's the thing - Thursday I won 500k again . When I send a message to their VIP assistant , the reply i got was shocking . I was asked how am i winning ? I told them to check my playing / betting history and verify everything .</p>
<p>When I was loosing over 15 lakh in a month no one bothered to check or advice me but when 3rd day I won they started behaving weird . I was told the entire amount will be processed and I need not worry , then by end of the day out of 5 lakhs they only processed 1,50,000 INR and when I checked with them that why they didn't process the entire amount , they said there is some issue and because next 2 days are bank holiday they cannot process .</p>
<p>Now all of you who put faith like me in this online establishments , I will tell you why we should not :</p>
<p>They smartly did not process my winnings</p>
<p>Gave me absurd reason</p>
<p>They only want us to loose</p>
<p>Showlion is definitely a BIG FRAUD as they will process certain amount till a point because they know you will deposit again but moment you start winning decent amounts they will play dirty games with you .</p>
<p>Me being an avid gambler, it is difficult to stop playing but all of us need to be strong and at least not put the money in these fraud establishments , because cashing out from them on winning little decent amounts is a big nightmare. In case if anyone wants proof of my entire experience (I have whatsapp chat , screenshot of conversation with their customer support , bank transfer acknowledgements of all deposits) please leave your comments and email address and i can share with you to verify all the claims I have made here.</p>
<p>I hope this helps everyone to make right choice and put money where you are not insecured , otherwise loosing money is part of our adventures but we don't want money to be lost through Fraud .</p>
<p>Good luck !</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
