<p>After signing deals with BetMGM and DraftKings, the Philadelphia 76ers have added another sportsbook to its roster. The NBA team just signed another deal, recruiting Betway to be its latest partner.</p>
<p>Betway Becomes an Official Partner of the Philadelphia 76ers</p>
<p>This past Monday, the 76ers announced that the team entered into a multi-year partnership with global online sports betting company Betway. As a result, the Super Group-owned betting company was named an Official Partner of the team. Moreover, the recent deal marked Betway’s seventh partnership with a franchise competing in the NBA.</p>
<p>The multi-year collaboration will benefit Betway with brand exposure. The logo of the betting company will be displayed during regular-season home games of the team on TV, but there will also be signage throughout the team’s The Center Arena. Additionally, courtside LEDs, basket stanchion LEDs and team bench aprons will display Betway signage during the games.</p>
<p>Betway will also benefit from exposure via the 76ers’ official digital channels, such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The betting company will sponsor pre-game stats graphics that will include key pre-game statistics for fans before each regular-season game of the team. Last but not least, the partnership will bring Betway signage next to the score table, which will boost visibility during TV broadcasts.</p>

<p>It was last week when Super Group announced that it went live in Iowa. Moreover, the company expanded its presence in Europe after Betway received a license in Poland. Before that, the betting company was named Official and Exclusive Free-to-Play Partner of the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
