<p>Securing a license for the regulated gambling market in the country enabled the company to launch its online casino offering with the brand Rizk</p>
<p>The global sports betting and gaming operator, Betsson Group, announced Tuesday that it successfully acquired a license for the regulated gambling market in Serbia. The latest announcement marks a milestone moment for the company as it enables it to grow further on the Old Continent and expand its reach to new audiences. Thanks to the Serbian license, Betsson can now officially launch its online casino games with Rizk, a popular brand for the market in the country. Rizk is a part of Zecure Gaming, a company that Betsson acquired a few years ago, in 2020.</p>
<p>The expansion to Serbia further complements Betsson’s global growth. In fact, it helps expand the company’s presence in the Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (CEECA) region. CEECA has been identified for its potential, considering that it contributed 43% of Betsson’s revenue for the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Recently, the company strengthened its esports offering via a deal with BETER, the leading content and data provider, powering iGaming, betting and esports operators. The deal, announced late last month, was facilitated via BETBAZAR and saw Betsson improve its esports capabilities.</p>
<p>An Exciting Moment for Rizk</p>
<p>Ronni Hartvig, Betsson’s chief commercial officer, acknowledged that he was delighted to see the performance of Zecure Gaming in the last few years. Finally, he said: “They have revitalized the essence of the Rizk brand, rekindling its inherent fun and excitement, and expertly applied their knowledge to multiple markets. I look forward to seeing what they will manage to achieve in this new market.”</p>
<p>“Serbia is an exciting new market for our brand, Rizk. We’re eager to replicate our successes in other markets as we see tremendous potential and opportunities awaiting us there.“ Andrew Valenzia, commercial director of Zecure Gaming</p>
<p>Andrew Valenzia, the commercial director of Betsson’s subsidiary, Zecure Gaming, shared the excitement of Hartvig. He spoke about the potential of the market in Serbia for the Rizk brand. Moreover, Valenzia said that the company will leverage its extensive experience to help the brand seize new market opportunities and expand. “Our team’s dedication and hard work have been key drivers of our achievements, and we’re prepared to bring the same level of energy to Serbia,” he explained in conclusion.</p>
