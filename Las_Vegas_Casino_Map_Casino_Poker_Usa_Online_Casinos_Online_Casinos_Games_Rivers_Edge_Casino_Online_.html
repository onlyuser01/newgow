<p>Hello, I gambled there overnight on April 29 and paid almost 700. A deposit of 50 euros was booked from my account but not credited to 1red. I contacted support and got a vip status there.</p>
<p>They said I had to wait 5 working days for the money to come to my account by itself. When that wasn't the case, all the documents were submitted several times, such as bank statements etc. Several times even. It really wasn't easy for me. It is now being clarified with the payment provider. Asked once a week, it was always waiting for an update. Now, after 6 weeks, I naturally asked again what was going on...</p>
<p>They act as if I hadn't submitted any documents yet and are already requesting everything again. What I've submitted there about 10 times now.</p>
<p>I feel pretty fooled by them. It's about the deposit after the 100 euro deposit of 50 euros. 1red says it failed.</p>
