    <h1>Caliente Casino Del Lago Resort And Casino Shoshone Rose Casino Wind Creek Online Casino Real Money</h1>

<p>The Southland Casino Hotel in West Memphis, Arkansas, has just wrapped up a huge expansion of its property. The renovations cost the company $320 million as it seeks to turn the venue into a true Las Vegas-styled gambling destination.</p>
<p>The Expansion Is Complete</p>
<p>The spectacular expansion took three years to complete. What once began as a racetrack with a few slot machines is now a full-fledged casino resort with a luxurious hotel and a rich selection of gambling options.</p>
<p>According to Lou Jacobs, CEO of Southland Casino Hotel’s ownership group, Delaware North, the finalization of the expansion “puts Southland on the map as a true casino destination.” He is certain that the expanded property will channel more customers toward the casino.</p>
<p>The venue now boasts a 20-story hotel with 300 rooms and a huge 113,000-square-foot casino facility. The latter offers its visitors a selection of 2,400 slot machines, 50 gaming tables and a sportsbook. In addition to that, guests can enjoy a rich choice of dining options. Lastly, Southland Casino Hotel constructed a new covered parking garage with more than 1,400 spaces. As a result, casino visitors no longer need to worry about parking.</p>
<p>Now that the construction work is all done, the operator will begin promoting the renewed venue to customers from the locale. Southland Casino Hotel hopes to cement itself as an attractive destination and welcome extra guests from Little Rock, Memphis, Nashville, Northern Alabama and St. Louis.</p>
<p>Southland Casino Hotel Names New President, Launches a Contest</p>
<p>The renewed Southland Casino Hotel will now be led by Osi Imomoh who will serve as its general manager and president. He is already familiar with the property’s team, having previously worked as the venue’s food and beverage director. Imomoh has worked with Delaware North, Southland Casino Hotel’s ownership group, for the last 15 years and has occupied various managing positions within the company. Prior to that, Imomoh worked for Isle of Capri Casinos for 7 years, where he once again managed food and beverage businesses.</p>
<p>To celebrate the finalized expansion, Delaware North partnered with the multinational food, snack and beverage corporation Pepsi. Thanks to this, it will hold a special “New Year, New Ride” contest. Participants can earn a share of a $250,000 prize pool and one lucky winner will take a brand-new Ford F-150 back home. To participate in the contest, one needs to be a member of the Lucky North Club, Southland Casino Hotel’s reward program.</p>
