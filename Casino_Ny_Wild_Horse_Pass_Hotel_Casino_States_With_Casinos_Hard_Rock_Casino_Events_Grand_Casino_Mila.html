    <h1>Casino Ny Wild Horse Pass Hotel Casino States With Casinos Hard Rock Casino Events Grand Casino Mila</h1>

<p>OK I was wrong I assume that my available balance was zero but there was $.38 in there from a prior bonus but the casino told me to play down and then if I need to deposit it will be good I want to put it I want to be deposited knowing the F if I knew the money was gonna be bad!! Do you know that is extremely tacky that they're going to withhold $5000 for me because a $.38 she made it sound like I continue to play on my winnings like like like $.38 really hope you can you make a damn wager with $.38 let alone no I want on my bitcoin deposit!! Can I legally do that because you know that's just tacky and cheesy and low I mean if it's not illegal it's straight a moral dude because you know there's nothing you can do a $.38 she made it seem like I'm at the scheme and I made a Deposit I want and I need to dry didn't clean when she even made it you didn't she know they didn't claim a bonus so if that's the case since I didn't claim it on the deposit and I'm entitled to one could you get one one bonus per deposit can I just use that $.38 is my bonus and then still keep the withdrawal then I didn't even realize that that was in there!! So technically then I'd only be using a one $.38 bonus and I didn't even know that was in it I don't know what to do man this is just this seems really low and dirty and it's just not right if they really value customers they would they would treat them better than this in the whole time all these days of been asking they just kept give me a huge consecutive bonuses over and over and over he went to a fine she's been out because of $.38 and you know she just didn't want to tell me if she even knows it's b***t there's got to be some minimum that that that and that's not counting as a bonus that is really no way to get the money off your account I mean how do you get rid of 38 since you can't tell me that they can deny a withdrawal to anyone who has it and overplayed bonus every single time they were not only makes a deposit that seems illegal to me but I'll do a screenshot hear of it it's pretty lame.</p>
