    <h1>Las Vegas Casinos Big Fish Casino Facebook Best Casino In Biloxi Casino Online Free Bonus Riverwind</h1>

<p>Dear Mohammed,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account closure? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be blocked and the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://play24bet.com/:</p>
<p>„Responsible gaming</p>
<p>At your discretion you may choose to be excluded from playing any games on the Play24Bet website. In order to block your access to the Games or to the Services and exclude yourself, you will need to send an email to the Play24Bet customer services department with the following subject "I want to be excluded from https://play24bet.com".</p>
<p>When sending an email to the customer service department in order to self-exclude yourself please specify the time period for which you want to exclude yourself, 1, 7, 14 days or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months or 1, 3, or 5 years.</p>
<p>If you would wish to reactivate your Play24Bet account, you will only be able to do so after your exclusion period has come to an end by contacting the customer support department by phone or email. A cooling off period will apply before your account is reopened after self-exclusion.</p>
<p>The Play24Bet self-exclusion option is a joint commitment between Play24Bet and you. Play24Bet will take reasonable steps and actions to prevent you from re-opening your account as well as opening a new account, but you must not attempt to re-open your account or to open a new account."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to? support@Play24Bet.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
