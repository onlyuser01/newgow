<p>That has to be KYC, no question about it, all casinos require!</p>
<p>Procedure; Deposit in the BIG 5 Casino 30.00, slots are doing quite well, want to withdraw profit. I paid in with Ecopayz, also wanted to withdraw via Ecopayz. Submitted the documents from Ecopayz, it was a screenshot on one page. Requirements was full name, full address, the BIC and also the IBAN on one page. I only got that as a screenshot at Ecopayz. Big5 replied: You have to make the first payment through a German bank (house bank), please only print the account statement on one page in PDF format or as a photograph, this is required by law! My answer, other casinos ask to make the first withdrawal, but first where the deposit was made first. Answer, no, first a house bank.</p>
<p>ok i tried house bank, doesnt work because there is nothing on one site. I called the bank, they just advised caution, suspected fraud! I submitted a bank statement with IBAN and BIC and the account number that applies to my name. In addition a second page with the name and address and this account number. Answer is not enough. I canceled the payout, continued to play up to 500.00, then deposited 10.00 via Viabuy and submitted the data from Viabyu for payout, all on one page. Mail again, I still have to send the house bank documents on one page. In the end, after more than 60 emails, I wasn't in the mood anymore, I was exhausted and canceled everything and gambled it away in my anger, either a jackpot or not, but I probably wouldn't have got it either. Another important piece of advice to everyone: get your hands off the BIG 5 Casino! Big5 Casino doesn't pay out! Make endless trouble like no other casino in the world when it comes to verification! If a win is pending, there will be no verification!</p>
