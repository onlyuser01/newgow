    <h1>Casino In Durant Lumiere Casino St Louis Stellaris Casino Aruba Westgate Resort Casino Las Vegas Cas</h1>

<p>Hello dear Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>I hope you can help me with my query.</p>
<p>I have an account verification at Rabona Casino and had already uploaded my account and was missing a requested: " Live picture of my ID and front + back and a selfie.</p>
<p>I did this the next day and then waited for the completed verification (I had three active withdrawals pending)</p>
<p>2x500, 1x365.</p>
<p>On December 30th, 2022, Rabona Casino sent me an email with a ridiculous explanation of some T&amp;Cs. And it really was a handful. Look for yourself.</p>
<p>"Dear Stefanie ****,</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your account did not pass the verification process and has now been closed without the right to reopen.</p>

<p>but is not limited to:</p>

<p>I am not told what the problem is or why you are not paying out my money.</p>
<p>I have the suspicion that you simply do not want to pay out my money and want to block the account.</p>
<p>And I find that cheeky, especially because I was even asked for a live selfie etc. in the verification process on the site and completed it by me.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, they can also call me via Skype or whatever. Well, I digress a bit and I have to apologize for my above words. Unfortunately, I'm a bit late with the complaint because I've been thinking about hiring a lawyer for a long time.</p>
<p>However, I think that Casino Guru does a very good job with complaints and wanted to describe my case here first.</p>
<p>I hope as mentioned above you can help me and get my money out of my account legitimately.</p>
<p>Thank you and if you have any questions or anything else, you can send me an email to: s****e@proton.me.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Stephanie ****</p>
