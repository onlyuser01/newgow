    <h1>Boomtown Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Hotels In Oklahoma Casino For Sale Mount Airy Casino Resort Reviews</h1>

<p>Thank you for your email and the details provided, Betmaster Casino team. Could you please look at my last email regarding this case and provide me with the additional data?</p>
<p>Dear BokiSps,</p>
<p>I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting the casino's claims of 3 connected accounts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while I will wait for the casino's response and additional data, I would like to comment on one of your previous posts and ask you a few questions to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>The casino allowed you to deposit more than once, to play, and you have not been verified anywhere else except for this disputed account - if there were other accounts created and even the casino's bonus offer was abused and used more than once, which is strictly prohibited in online casinos, and if the verification was not completed on these accounts, the casino was not able to identify this fact earlier than you requested a withdrawal and/or started the verification process. If you made more deposits before but did not manage to win, we are talking about a common situation, and you simply lost them by playing in the casino, that is all. However, not passing KYC on other accounts does not mean that you could have created multiple accounts and/or abused the casino's bonus offer, nor does it mean that you have not violated the casino's terms and conditions.</p>
<p>What type of games did you play in the casino the most? What was the reason for creating more than 1 account? Or, can you please explain how it is possible that there are data matches between your and 2 other accounts (created on January 22, 2023, and April 16, 2023)?</p>
<p>Can you please send me the email or communication from the casino where they informed you that the verification had been successfully completed?</p>
<p>Feel free to use my email (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
