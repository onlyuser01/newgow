<p>Gaming industry data science company Future Anthem announced today it entered into a partnership deal with UK-based gaming operator Betfred to become its AI &amp; Game Data Science partner.</p>
<p>Insights Will Boost Player Experience</p>
<p>The agreement with the AI specialist will allow Betfred to leverage real time utility and insights from Future Anthem to its online gaming channel and continue to innovate and boost experience for its players.</p>
<p>“We continue to invest in our core platforms and technologies, in order to offer the best customer experience to our players.” Rakesh Chablani, Managing Director, Betfred Digital</p>
<p>Future Anthem will deploy its data processing capabilities to extract anonymized game data related to player behavior while at play and provide surface and action insights to Betfred, thus allow the gaming operator to increase the level of game personalization via recommendations delivered through marketing and online campaigns.</p>
<p>“Taking advantage of Future Anthem’s existing technology, AI models, and experienced staff, under the guidance and leadership of our strong in-house data team, enables us to satisfy more of our objectives in a shorter timeframe.” Rakesh Chablani, Managing Director, Betfred Digital</p>
<p>Leigh Nissim, chief executive officer at Future Anthem, expressed the excitement of the team at the data science company from the opportunity to collaborate with a prominent industry name such as Betfred, known for its customer-orientation.</p>
<p>“Working with a customer-orientated organisation such as Betfred brings out the best in our Game Data Science – our behavioural models are a great addition to the Betfred.com customer journey with automated recommendations that improve the player experience for everyone. We’re excited to be working with Betfred’s team on this journey.” Leigh Nissim, CEO, Future Anthem</p>
<p>Game Data Science Market Leader</p>
<p>The latest partnership agreement with Betfred continues to affirm Future Anthem’s market leader position in terms of game data science and AI-based solutions.</p>
<p>In November 2020, Isle of Man-based gambling group GVC Holdings, now Entain, partnered with Future Anthem under its Advanced Responsibility and Care (ARC) program for safer gambling to pilot the recently developed by the data science company Anthemetrics Safer Play Responsible Gambling solution.</p>
<p>Among the most recent partnerships for Future Anthem was the one with leading innovator in slot development Big Time Gaming (BTG) in February. Under the deal, Future Anthem’s game data science platform Anthemetrics will provide player behavior modelling and interactive visualizations to allow BTG a deeper understanding into customers and ways to optimize its product portfolio.</p>
