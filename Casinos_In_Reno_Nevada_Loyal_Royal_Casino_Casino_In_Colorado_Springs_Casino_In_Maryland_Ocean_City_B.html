<p>Online casino games provider and operator Glitnor Group announced today the acquisition of KaFe Rocks, an iGaming affiliate company, for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Entering the Lead Generation Space</p>
<p>The acquisition of KaFe Rocks, a gambling affiliate business operating out of Malta, announced the entry of Glitnor Group into the online gambling lead generation space and is expected to contribute to the future growth of the group.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Glitnor Group chief executive officer David Flynn did not hide the ambition of the company he leads to “become a leading iGaming group,” with the acquisition of KaFe Rocks as the proof of the group’s strong intent to establish its presence in lead generation.</p>
<p>“In KaFe Rocks we have an established business being run by an incredibly talented team that owns and operates a network of successful, reputable affiliate assets that will drive growth for the wider group.” David Flynn, CEO, Glitnor Group</p>
<p>“I look forward to working closely with Simon, Feda and the entire KaFe Rocks team of 170 Rocketeers as we further expand Glitnor Group’s Total Addressable Market across the iGaming and Sportsbook value-chain, offering reputable iGaming products and services around the world,’ Flynn added.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group’s acquisition of KaFe Rocks complements the group’s business that is currently running B2C online casino brands Lucky Casino and Gambola, as well as B2B casino content supplier Swintt.</p>
<p>In Great Hands Going Forward</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of KaFe Rocks, certain personnel at the affiliation company will join the ranks of Glitnor Group: co-founder Feda Mecan will join the board of directors at Glitnor, while chief executive officer Simon Pilkington will become part of the executive management team.</p>
<p>“I’ve been hugely impressed with the leadership team at Glitnor and am massively excited for what the future holds for both KaFe Rocks and the Glitnor Group,” Pilkington said, outlining that “both companies share a vision for growth, … value the people driving it” and believe the culture they create allows people to thrive.</p>
<p>“The trust that they are showing in us to continue being KaFe Rocks is gratefully received and I’m extremely driven to deliver the results that will help the new group achieve its goals.” Simon Pilkington, CEO, KaFe Rocks</p>
<p>Based in Malta, KaFe Rocks is currently boasting a global portfolio of assets and operations across more than 10 markets. Its most popular brands include time2play.com, USCasinos.com and Online-slot.co.uk. Following the acquisition, KaFe Rocks’ day-to-day management will continue within its current format.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the announcement, KaFe Rocks co-founder Tim Trepass emphasized the central role people play at the affiliate company and the need to find the “right people to work with going forwards” to accelerate growth. He went on to outline the future of KaFe Rocks would be in “great hands” under the Glitnor management, looking forward to leveraging his experience and desire to help drive Glitnor forward.</p>
