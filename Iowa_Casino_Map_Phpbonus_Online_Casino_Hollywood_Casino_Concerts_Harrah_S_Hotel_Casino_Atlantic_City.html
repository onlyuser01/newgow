<p>Greentube is delighted to expand its Latvian reach with a local powerhouse such as TonyBet, a spokesperson said</p>
<p>Greentube, NOVOMATIC’s digital gaming and entertainment division, has consolidated its presence in the regulated Latvian market thanks to a deal with TonyBet. Per the agreement, Greentube will provide the local operator with its engaging gaming content.</p>
<p>Following the integration, a selection of classic and innovative Greentube and blue chip NOVOMATIC games are available to Latvian gamblers. These include hits such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Lucky Lady’s Charm Deluxe and Sizzling Hot, as well as the innovative Diamond Link and Cash Connections series.</p>
<p>Greentube, which is a popular name in the Baltics, will be able to further expand its regional reach. Its iconic online slot games have proven to be a resounding success with players in Baltic countries. At the same time, Greentube continues to augment its overall reach in Europe. The region is a core market for the company’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>TonyBet, meanwhile, is an ambitious online gambling and sports betting operator that is just as bullish on expanding its presence in Europe. The operator holds licenses in 10 iGaming jurisdictions and will also roll out Greentube content in Spain.</p>

Zvi added that seeing its games go in Latvia with such a significant operator is nothing short of fantastic.</p>
<p>TonyBet has made great strides in recent years in building a large customer base, with safer gambling at the heart of its strategy, and we also look forward to serving its players in Spain in due course. Opher Ben Zvi, deputy head of sales and key account management, Greentube</p>
