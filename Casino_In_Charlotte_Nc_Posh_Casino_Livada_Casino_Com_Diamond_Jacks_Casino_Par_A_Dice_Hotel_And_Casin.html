<p>Booming Games is returning to Ancient Rome with the introduction of its aptly themed Power of Rome slot, a game that the supplier jests, wasn’t built in a day, harking back to the old adage that celebrates the architectural magnificence of the Eternal City and pays homage the ingenuity that went into constructing it over the centuries.</p>
<p>Showing a similar meticulousness for detail, Booming Games has built a game that feels and plays like a classic game, but with a handful of exciting twists, including a five-by-three grid, 20 fixed paylines, and plenty of landmarks turned into an important part of the gameplay and design of the game to add to the genuineness of the game and its authentic feel.</p>
<p>Power of Rome features Wilds and Wild Multipliers, and Gladiators who may show up anywhere on the reels to award additional multipliers of 5x. Wild Multipliers may hit a payline together, resulting in even more glory to players.</p>
<p>The game is naturally keen on exploring other popular mechanics – and does – with the introduction of Scatter Symbols, which trigger the Free Spins, of which there are up to 15. Locked Wilds will appear during the Free Spins round to make sure that you are getting a good value out of your gameplay all the same, and Wild Multipliers will keep stacking up to push the value of each spin of the reels up.</p>
<p>Booming Games Director of Product Moritz Blume was similarly excited to see his company take a dig once again at one of the most glorious times of mankind, bringing Ancient Rome to the slot expeirence in the 21st century. The company has already pulled at other historical threads, including Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greek, and the glory of the Roman Empire definitely falls in the same category.</p>
<p>"It’s not just the setting that catches the eye here. Gripping gladiatorial gameplay goes hand-in-hand with a feast of features. Colosseums were the home of epic wins during the rise of the Romans – and this game is ready to follow suit," gushes, happy with the new release and its cultural and mechanical significance.</p>
<p>Booming Games has also been growing its footprint as a supplier of games. The company expanded in Denmark through a partnership with RoyalCasino late last year.</p>
