    <h1>Red Garter Casino Truefortune Casino Hard Rock Casino Ft Lauderdale Sioux City Casino Draftkings Cas</h1>

<p>On the 18th August I was playing on Jackpot City and I woke up the next morning with an issue. They are the first ever casino Ive made an account with. It has been an active account for about 2 years nearly. I received an email on the 19th august saying " we have received your self-exclusion request and it has been successfully applied. " I was so angry while reading this email because I never requested this as I had $588.00 in my account still remaining from the night before(18/08) . I have been trying for a whole week to get back into my account and nothing has worked I also have been trying to contact Jackpot City everyday since this situation has happened and they have been difficult to get ahold of. Eventually tonight (26/08) I was successful in reaching them. But when I discussed from my point of view what had happened they said they can't remove the self-exclusion until the 6 month period has ended no matter what. Ive tried to explain to them that I wouldn't request an exclusion when I have an active balance of a high amount in there. I asked them if they can provide me with an IP address of the device that the person was on when the self exclusion was made, they said they don't hold that information. But I disagree I think they just don't want to help me. So that's why Im reaching out to you guys to help me please.</p>
