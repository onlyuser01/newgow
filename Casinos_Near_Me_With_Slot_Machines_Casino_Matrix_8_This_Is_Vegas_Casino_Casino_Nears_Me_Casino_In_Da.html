<p>BetMGM, the leading sports betting and iGaming operator, announced a new partnership agreement with the Cincinnati Reds, the famous American professional baseball team that competes in Major League Baseball (MLB). The operator unveiled the announcement on Tuesday. Under the terms of the new deal, BetMGM was named the Official Sports Betting Partner of the team.</p>
<p>The leading sports betting operator will benefit from brand exposure, available at Great American Ball Park, the home of the Cincinnati Reds. The collaboration brings a permanent BetMGM outfield sign behind the team's home plate, as well as branded foil line for select games.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the collaboration will bring benefits for sports fans and fans of the team too. The new collaboration will create unique VIP experiences for sports fans that will include even on-field access during Cincinnati Reds' battling practice.</p>
<p>Additionally, BetMGM's new collaboration with the MLB team will see the launch of a new BetMGM Sportsbook at Great American Ball Park. The new sportsbook will take the space that is currently occupied by the Machine Room restaurant. According to a statement released by BetMGM, the new sportsbook will be accessible from "outside the ticketed areas of the ballpark via the arena plaza level entrance."</p>
<p>Doug Healy, Cincinnati Reds' Chief Financial Officer, commented on the topic by saying: "With sports gaming coming to Ohio, the Reds sought to bring the highest quality operator to our ballpark for those fans who choose to participate in sports gaming." He acknowledged that BetMGM is a leading operator that has significant expertise in both sports betting and entertainment. Last but not least, Healy deemed the operator as the best partner that fits the fan base and will help draw new guests to the city.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM's CEO, added: "Today's announcement marks the beginning of our plans to create the most entertaining and dynamic sports betting experiences in Ohio." He explained that BetMGM's collaboration with MGM Northfield Park and the Cincinnati Reds will deliver unique experiences and content for sports fans in Ohio.</p>
<p>In that line of thought, the Buckeye State legalized sports betting back in December last year. However, the launch of the activity is planned for a date no later than January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>BetMGM's latest announcement comes after the operator announced that it extended its collaboration with the MLB. Thanks to this, BetMGM kept its position as MLB's Official Sports Betting partner. It was back in 2018 when the duo first joined forces. This was a groundbreaking deal at the time as the operator became the first-ever Official Gaming and Entertainment partner for the League.</p>
