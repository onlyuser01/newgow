<p>Relax Gaming and Entain are broaching new ground together as both companies are seeking to improve their standing in the Spanish market. In fact, this is a first for Relax Gaming which has obtained approval from the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego or DGOJ to go ahead and launch 30-odd of its award-winning games.</p>
<p>Bringing Relax Gaming’s Titles to Spanish Casino Players</p>
<p>More are expected shortly. Titles such as Temple Tumble Beast Mode and Money Train 2 will now be readily available across Entain’s dedicated partycasino.es, partypoker.es, and bwin.es brands, as the entertainment giant is doubling down on regulated marking gaming.</p>
<p>Spain presents unique opportunities despite recent regulatory headwinds which have reduced advertisement and raised the bar for most regulated companies. Still, the Spanish iGaming market is highly competitive and has at least 50 operators currently active in it today.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming already sees potential for growth in the country as many of its partners that operate elsewhere are also licensed in Spain. This means that the company will shortly follow this content partnership with other announcements that will expand its footprint and presence in the Spanish iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming broke ground in another equally important market earlier this year, Italy. Italy, similar to Spain, is a highly-regulated market that puts consumer safety first. Relax Gaming’s regulation-ready products though remain as competitive and as flexible as ever to weather any abrupt legal changes while providing consumers and operators with the best value.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CRO Alexia Smilovic Rønde welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was happy to add Spain as one of the supported jurisdictions in the region. She added:</p>
<p>Spain is known for its heightened regulatory conditions, which differ from other similar markets, and with Relax Gaming’s expertise, technology and content we were up to that challenge – with the goal of delivering the market’s most seamless experience available to licensed operators and their players.

<p>Welcome Opportunity for Entain to Boost Presence</p>
<p>Entain gaming commercial director Obdulio Bacarese was equally pleased with these developments and said that seeing Relax Gaming’s titles enter the Spanish market with the company’s products was an important step forward.</p>
<p>Bacarese acknowledged the “massive impact” that Relax Gaming titles have had elsewhere in Europe and said that he was expecting nothing less from Relax in the Spanish market. Relax currently powers an offer of more than 3,000 online casino games.</p>
<p>The company is a leading B2B supplier and has been nominated across ten categories for the EGR B2B Awards, among receiving other distinctions. Relax Gaming recently released Midnight Marauder and Snake Arena slots as part of its latest additions.</p>
