    <h1>Yabby Casino Login Chicago Casino Casino West Memphis Arkansas Maine Casino Riverside Casino Riversi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your request.</p>
<p>Please be advised that I have checked all the emails and phone numbers that you mentioned above and indeed I've found that you registered more than one account in our system using different logins.</p>
<p>I would like to draw your attention that by creating new accounts with different emails and phone numbers you violate the company's T&amp;Cs, which say that users are allowed to have only one account.</p>
<p>I also see that all of your accounts were immediately blocked upon your request. I've also requested to block account +17052309906.</p>
<p>Please be kindly advised that we do not collect customer's personal data like name, address or DOB. I assume that you checked our registration flow and T&amp;Cs before signing up. So it was your decision to agree to this registration flow and you know that every time you created a new account, you breached casino's rules. As you probably know no casino allows having more than one account, but you created more and more emails and phone numbers to abuse our system. Unfortunately, we can't be responsible for your actions in this case and draw your attention that if any new account will be discovered, it will be blocked and funds forfeited.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have forwarded your feedback related to the registration flow to the corresponding department for further consideration.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
