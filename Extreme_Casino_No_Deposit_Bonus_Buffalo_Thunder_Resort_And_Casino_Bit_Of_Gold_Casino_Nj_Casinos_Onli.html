    <h1>Extreme Casino No Deposit Bonus Buffalo Thunder Resort And Casino Bit Of Gold Casino Nj Casinos Onli</h1>

<p>Dear Kiwisnap88,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you provided all the required documents as soon as possible and in the correct format? If yes, I believe that it is only a matter of time before your account is verified and the delay could be easily caused by the holiday season.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is any other relevant communication between you and the casino, please forward it to kristina.s@casino.guru. Alternatively, you can post it here.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
