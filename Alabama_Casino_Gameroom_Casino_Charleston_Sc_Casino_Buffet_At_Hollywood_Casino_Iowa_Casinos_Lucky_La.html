<p>Lucky Lady’s Charm review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charms takes a selection of old superstitions about lucky objects and collects them together in a kitsch and tacky way. The horseshoes, four-leaf clovers, seven-spotted ladybirds, and ten-cent pieces are staples of slot machine iconography.</p>
<p>However, they are rarely so cheaply flung together. Lucky Lady’s Charm lacks character or style in the way the theme is put to use and as a result, fails to be as engaging as other slots that attempt the same sort of thing.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are the big letdown of Lucky Lady’s Charm. They look cheap, lack character, and exist in a bland void painted the ugliest possible shade of pink.</p>
<p>As well as ugly artwork, the other aspects of Lucky Lady’s Charm entirely fail to boost the slot's sense of atmosphere or style. There is no background music and the reel sounds are generic and tired.</p>
<p>Over all of this is laid a small set of dull, badly timed animations that mark out wins and provide a touch of movement during the spins.</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charm, in other words, is utterly charmless.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is a simple five reel slot with three rows and ten win lines.</p>
<p>There is a simple gamble feature in which players can play a game of double or nothing. This feature does not affect the player’s expected return but does increase the volatility of the game.</p>
<p>There is also a very basic free spin bonus.</p>
<p>In other words there is nothing to make this slot stand out from the crowd in its game mechanics.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charm has no Wild symbol. It does have a Scatter though.</p>
<p>The Scatter pays out for two or more symbols anywhere on any reel so long as they appear in the same spin.</p>
<p>If they hit three or more Scatters, the player will also trigger a bonus of fifteen free spins. During the Free Spin Bonus, a multiplier of times three is applied to all winnings.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Developer does not list the return to player in the game’s documentation. Unlisted RTP data is a problem as it can allow companies to hide an extortionate vig.</p>
<p>At least one other review site lists the return to player as 95.13%, which is below average. However, they do not list their source so you will have to take that number with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01, if you play one line, and goes up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin if you play all ten.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which would make it a great match for our slot machine strategies, which favour the highest possible volatility, if only Lucky Lady’s Charms were prettier or had a better return to player.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Lucky Lady’s Charm is unlikely to seduce any player into trying their own luck playing the game. The first impressions are of an ugly, generic slot, with the most basic forms of gameplay.</p>
<p>Looking deeper the player is given no information on the return to player and only the high volatility proves of interest.</p>
<p>And yet there is an X-factor that seems to connect with people, as this slot is very popular.</p>
<p>We would suggest giving it a try and seeing if this lady to charms you.</p>
