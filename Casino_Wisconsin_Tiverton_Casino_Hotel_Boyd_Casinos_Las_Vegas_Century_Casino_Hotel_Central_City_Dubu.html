    <h1>Casino Wisconsin Tiverton Casino Hotel Boyd Casinos Las Vegas Century Casino Hotel Central City Dubu</h1>

<p>Last month, French gaming operator La Française des Jeux (FDJ) launched Nirio, a new payment solution that transforms invoices into QR codes. During the same month, the operator announced it was considering the acquisition of horse racing and betting brand ZEturf, right before teaming up with Foundation du Patrimoine and donating $1.26 million for the restoration of YMCA Paris.</p>
<p>Now, the operator has introduced its Q3 2022 report to the public. The numbers are looking good, with a 12% year-on-year increase in revenue in the spotlight. Originally, FDJ anticipated a 5% full-year revenue growth for 2022. Let’s dive into the rest of the Q3 2022 numbers for the operator that counts 25-year exclusive rights and offers top-notch brands, products, and responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Excellent Performance for Lottery Games</p>
<p>Given the important number of high jackpots recorded by its lottery games, the leader of the French gaming industry also announced a 14$ growth in revenue in this department, with the numbers reaching €478 million ($467 million). As for sports betting activities, they recorded revenues of €97 million, similar to last year’s results. Nonetheless, the upcoming FIFA World Cup is likely to give a new boost to these numbers. At the same time, revenue from the rest of the activities connected to the operator also went through a €3 million ($2.92 million) growth, reaching €18 million ($17.48 million). Distribution channels also did well, with points of sale going up 6% and online channels recording a 35% boost.</p>
<p>8% Full-Year Revenue at the Horizon</p>
<p>The company has projected its full-year revenue to go over the 8% mark in light of its most recent report. The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) margin is also likely to go near the 24% mark, higher than the original predictions made at the head of the year. Similar EBITDA predictions made at the beginning of the year mentioned the 23.5% mark.</p>
<p>FDJ Group’s chief executive officer and chairwoman Stéphane Pallez spoke about the “strong momentum” that the group had recorded at the start of 2022, which kept going all the way into the third quarter. Pallez also mentioned the company was “particularly pleased” with the excellent comeback recorded by their point-of-sale network, further explaining the full year will be a reflection of their strategy that relies on two distribution channels. The full-year numbers are also expected to confirm their responsible growth model designed for long-term results.</p>
<p>On November 17, FDJ will hold an Investor Day debating its financial and non-financial objectives and strategies in the medium term. Next February, the company is expected to report its 2022, just before the official opening of the French gaming market.</p>
