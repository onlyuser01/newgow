    <h1>Treasure Island Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Hinckley Mn Casino Casino Yuma Bellagio Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>Ocean Casino Resort, a land-based gaming venue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, announced today it entered into a partnership with sports betting technology provider USBookmaking.</p>
<p>Preparing for Sports Betting Launch</p>
<p>The partnership between Elys Game Technology subsidiary USBookmaking and Ocean Casino Resort covers the casino’s trading management services and future retail sportsbook solution and is set to kick in March 2022. The new partnership is pending regulatory approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE).</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Bill Callahan, who was recently promoted as an interim chief executive officer at Ocean Casino, following the departure of CEO Terry Glebocki last month, said that the business was looking to “capitalize” on USBookmaking’s expertise and “best-in-class experience.”</p>
<p>As Ocean continues to strengthen its position within Atlantic City, the addition of a renowned organization such as USBookmaking should only serve to bolster our land-based wagering product.” Bill Callahan, Interim CEO, Ocean Casino Resort</p>
<p>Currently live with six tribal casino customers in North America, as well as via online channels and retail shops in Italy, USBookmaking is planning to expand its sports betting technology and platform to casinos and independent business venues in the US and Canada, pending regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>First Step in this Partnership</p>
<p>President of USBookmaking Vic Salerno noted the tech supplier is looking forward to “deepening its relationship” with the casino in the next few years, seeking to combine the casino’s “knowledge of the Atlantic City players’ market” with the tech company’s over 125 years of collective experience in the sports betting space to get a “formidable recipe for success” and “take on the challenge” presented by the level of competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>On behalf of the parent company, Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman of Elys Game Technology, outlined the excitement at the opportunity to partner with Ocean and offer a “highly entertaining and competitive sports wagering product.”</p>
<p>Our cutting-edge technology built in the competitive European market, coupled with the extensive experience of our USBookmaking team represents our capability of deploying our North American go-to-market strategy in a wide range of assignments including large premier casino resorts such as Ocean.” Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman, Elys Game Technology</p>
<p>Ocean Casino Resort is set to expand next year after a recent announcement for a re-investment of over $75 million will see the hotel add more than 460 guest rooms and suites, on top of improvements the property introduced this year to its casino floor that is now offering new high limit games.</p>
<p>Elys Game Technology will need to acquire platform certification and Casino Service Industry Enterprise License from the New Jersey DGE before any launch of sports betting operations at Ocean Casino Resort can commence.</p>
