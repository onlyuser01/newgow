    <h1>Renaissance Jaragua Hotel Casino Santo Domingo Funzpoints Com Casino Nd Casinos Best Casino In Oklah</h1>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I wouldn't say this is a question of licensing authority, it's more about actual business standards.</p>
<p>Allow me to go through the main problem with the self-exclusion at first:</p>
<p>a) player requested his/her account to be closed. Casino closes the account. A few days later the same player asks for his account to be reopened. The casino opens the account because the player asked for it.</p>
<p>b) player requested his/her account to be closed due to gambling issues because he/she is unable to control his passion and needs special care. Casino closes the account. A few days later the same player requests his/her account to be opened. The casino does not open the account because the gambling issues were mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Furthermore and sadly, it's the business standard that to get self-excluded from some "sister" site, the player must inform the sister casino as well. Please do not think that all casinos owned by the same owner/group share those requests through the group automatically.</p>
<p>I'd call it a nice surprise if you come across a group that acts differently.</p>
