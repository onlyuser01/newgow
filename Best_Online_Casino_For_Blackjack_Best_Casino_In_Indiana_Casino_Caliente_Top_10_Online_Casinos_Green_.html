    <h1>Best Online Casino For Blackjack Best Casino In Indiana Casino Caliente Top 10 Online Casinos Green</h1>

<p>Verification measures cry out for data theft and fraud.</p>
<p>I was asked to send my identity card, which was still in the scope, my phone number, an account statement with my card used &amp; an invoice. All well and good. But when I took all the necessary measures, I was still not verified and the following cannot be beaten in audacity. I was asked to send the front of my credit card, including the expiry date. I wrote with support for an hour and discussed why this was necessary. Nowhere is it in the Terms &amp; Conditions for the verification measures themselves. I had met all the criteria, but the support employee was firmly convinced that he could ask me for a picture of my credit card with the argument from the AGBS:</p>
<p>"The Personal Information which we may request to use and process shall include, without limitation:</p>
<p>Any of the information that you provide to us when filling in the forms on our account registration pages, as well as any other data that you further submit via the Website or email (eg first and last name, date of birth, email address, phone number);</p>
<p>Correspondence made with us via the Website, email, web chat or through other means of communication;</p>
<p>All Player Account transaction history, whether this takes place via the Website (s) or via other means of communication;</p>
<p>Website logins and their details, including traffic data, GeoIP location data, browser / device data, weblogs, activity logs and other traffic information recorded in our system;</p>
<p>Documents and proofs reasonably requested by us to verify your account, to process deposits or withdrawals and to conduct anti-fraud checks (on our own initiative or as required by applicable legislation). Such proofs may include passport scans, payment slips, bank statements, etc.</p>
<p>Survey participations or any other customer assessments that we may carry out from time to time. "</p>
<p>"Such proofs may include passport scans, payment slips, bank statements, etc."</p>
<p>"This" etc "include a great variety of documents as well as credit cards"</p>
<p>He referred to an "etc" in the AGBS to request more highly private data from me so that I can verify my account which is just brazen and smells of fraud.</p>
<p>At the time he had my verified cell phone number, my ID card (which was actually too much)</p>
<p>An account statement from my credit card + A physical picture of my credit card where the expiry date and the middle 8 numbers were censored.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason why I should send this uncensored since he had more than enough data from me to know that I really am.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he referred to the "internal protocol" of the site's license, which is not visible and what the site is doing, not the Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
<p>Apparently the AGBS / Terms &amp; Conditions are worthless and do not exist according to logic.</p>
<p>They don't want to have my profit paid out.</p>
<p>I do not recommend anyone to use the site and to be extremely careful when dealing with it.</p>
