<p>Tyson Fury vs. Francis Ngannou is a boxing mega-bout that will take place on October 28 in Saudi Arabia. Gypsy King is a huge favorite to beat the Predator who’s making his boxing debut this coming weekend</p>
<p>Tyson Fury is an undefeated boxing legend who won’t be putting his heavyweight championship belts on the table for this fight. Instead, he’s going to fight Oleksandr Usyk next year in a title unification bout.</p>
<p>There’s not too much pressure on him against Francis Ngannou but losing this fight would be embarrassing for Gypsy King. After all, he’s got 33 wins, one draw, and zero losses in his portfolio, while Predator has never fought a boxing bout before.</p>

<p>Tyson Fury Planning to Knock Francis Ngannou Out</p>
<p>Tyson Fury’s got a knockout-to-win ratio of 70.58%, which is really impressive considering that he’s fought some of the best boxers in history during his 15-year-long professional career.</p>
<p>Further, Fury won each of his bouts fought in the 2020s decade by a knockout/technical knockout. Two of those were against Deontay Wilder, one of the best KO experts in the world. Fury also defeated Dillian Whyte and Derek Chisora last year.</p>
<p>This year, he hasn’t fought a single bout, but he’s apparently been working hard preparing for the fight with Usyk. When it comes to the bout with Ngannou, Fury seems 100% certain he’s going to triumph. In fact, he’s confident he’ll finish the Predator within the first six rounds.</p>
<p>Is Francis Ngannou Just After a Big Payday or He Wants More?</p>
<p>Francis Ngannou is going to earn millions from the mega bout in Saudi Arabia, but is that his only motivation? If he could beat Fury this weekend, he’d establish himself as one of the best athletes in two combat sports – boxing and mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>In his MMA career, Ngannou is 17-3 overall with 12 wins by KO/TKO. The former UFC Heavyweight Champion used to land 2.33 significant strikes per minute during his UFC days, which isn’t much, but his strikes aren’t about volume but power. This guy holds the Guinness World Record for the hardest punch ever recorded.</p>
<p>When it comes to striking defense, he’s absorbing 2.16. What’s also very interesting is that he’s never been KO-ed in MMA. But this time, he’s fighting a boxing bout against one of the best pugilists in history.</p>
<p>Tyson Fury vs. Francis Ngannou Prediction</p>
<p>Tyson Fury is a -1500 favorite for a reason. He’s one of the best boxers ever, while his opponent has never fought a boxing bout in his life. That said, if Fury didn’t win in Arabia, it would be one of the biggest upsets in the history of professional sports. We think he’s going to win easily, probably with an early knockout.</p>
<p>Pick: Tyson Fury to win by KO/TKO</p>
