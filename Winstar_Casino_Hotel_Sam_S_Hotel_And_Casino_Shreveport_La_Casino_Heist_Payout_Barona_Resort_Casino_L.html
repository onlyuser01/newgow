<p>Barcrest – the old-school gambling company with a modern outlook</p>
<p>If you happened to visit a British pub in the 1980s or 1990s, the chances are, among the smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke in the bar, you'd have found a Barcrest fruit machine standing in a corner.</p>
<p>To many British people, the name goes together with famous beer brands like John Smith and Guinness, which is appropriate as the company that launched the Barcrest brand back in 1968 was Bass PLC, a famous UK brewer. Bass saw the potential for the fruit machines among pub regulars, who liked to play a game or two as they drank a pint. Their success led them other areas of the UK leisure industry, including arcade games and the ever-popular bingo, and later they expanded into the European market.</p>
<p>Fast forward 30 years or so later, and Barcrest were dominating the UK 'Amusement with Prize' (AWP) market, with 36,000 machines making up a 40% market share. It led to a multi-million-pound takeover by International Gaming Technology (IGT) in 1998, a deal which meant Barcrest content would be distributed globally for the first time.</p>
<p>As the new millennium approached, Barcrest adopted a focus on the digital gaming sphere. It launched a range of virtual slots, most notably Rainbow Riches in 2006, as a way of breaking into this new world of interactive world, and many online operators jumped on board.</p>
<p>The move was enough to attract the attention of gaming giant Scientific Games (SG), who bought Barcrest from IGT in 2011 and combined it with lottery operator 'The Global Draw' to form its new virtual gaming division.</p>
<p>Barcrest operates under the SG name today, benefitting from the latest game technology and continuing to release vibrant new slots games for a growing online market.</p>
<p>Barcrest slots</p>
<p>Barcrest is known for its user-friendly range of virtual slots games that players can access on any medium they choose, whether it be on their desktop computer or via a mobile-friendly casino. Most Barcrest slots come with a Big Bet option, that allows you to play for bigger prizes in return for a larger stake.</p>
<p>Rainbow Riches is its most famous game, inspired by the famous Irish legend of the leprechaun and the supposed luck that it entails. It operates on a simple 5-reel, 3-row format and you need to match three or more symbols on any payline to get a win. There are three bonus features – the 'Road to Riches', when you land three leprechaun symbols; the 'Wishing Well', where you choose one of three wells to get a prize, and the 'Pots of Gold', a multiplier that triggers when you land three pot symbols. There's also a free spins variant of this game, if you prefer.</p>
<p>For a later Barcrest offering, Snow Leopard offers a completely different theme altogether, set in a snowy world of ice and predators. You might get the chance to win up to 50 free spins in a separate feature, or a big win by landing the leopard's face – the game's scatter. The game shows off Barcrest's upgrade to better graphics than older titles, which you can enjoy as you spin the reels.</p>
<p>You may also see the odd Barcrest slot that uses famous brand names. Monopoly Big Event is one of them – a game that uses all of the famous symbols, from the dog to the racing car. Like with many Barcrest games, its free spins offerings are generous, particularly with the Locking Wilds bonus where any wild that appears on the reels is locked in for the duration of the feature. The slot also uses the game's community and chance cards in a fun way, revealing which prizes are on offer as you play.</p>
<p>You can play all the above games our list of free Barcrest games - an ideal way of checking them out without it costing you a cent.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Barcrest casino online</p>
<p>While Barcrest games come with a seal of quality, it doesn't mean that all casinos offering them subscribe to the same standards. This is why we need to take care when choosing a casino to play these games in.</p>
<p>This page can help you do this. The Casino Guru team of analysts have assessed each casino on our database and awarded them a review and rating based on their performance. You can find out how we do this by reading our How we review online casinos article.</p>
<p>To get started, we suggest you take a look at our recommended Barcrest casinos. You can find these by selecting the 'Recommended' tab where you'll get a list of the highest-scoring sites.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may want to see the newest Barcrest casinos out there, these new casino sites are often relatively unknown entities but might offer some tempting welcome offers to new players. Click on the 'Newly opened' tab to see these.</p>
<p>You can also just see the complete list of eligible sites by selecting the 'All' tab.</p>
<p>Note: There are other filters that can help you narrow down the list further. Maybe you'd like to find Barcrest casinos that offer a certain payment method, in which case you select it in the 'Payment method' filter. Visa and Paypal casinos are two possible examples. You can find sites that offer your favored currency, game type and language this way, too.</p>
<p>Barcrest casino bonuses</p>
<p>One thing that online casinos offer that real-life venues generally don't is a bonus. Sometimes they award you a deposit bonus after adding money to your account, other times they give you a no deposit bonus just for registering.</p>
<p>You can find out which Barcrest casino bonuses are out there via Casino Guru. Our list of casino bonuses is the place to start – the home of all our bonus offerings. Type 'Barcrest' into the game provider filter there to see the bonuses that apply. If you'd like a particular bonus, then go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and hit the one you'd like: for no deposit bonuses, for example, just choose that box. You can also see these by going to list of no deposit bonuses and selecting 'Barcrest'.</p>
<p>Concerned that these are out of date? Don't worry, our team does its very best every day to keep the list fresh and relevant.</p>
