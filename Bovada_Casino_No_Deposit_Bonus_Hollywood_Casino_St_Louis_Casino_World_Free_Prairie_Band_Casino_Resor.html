<p>More disciplines may be added at a later date if Kentucky feels confident in their integrity</p>
<p>The Kentucky Sports Wagering Advisory Council has published a Wagering Catalog outlining all the sports upon which wagers may be conducted. The publication follows a meeting of the council and comes ahead of the launch of sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Recommended by Hans Stokke, the director of sports betting at the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, the list includes a large number of events although some were still left out.</p>
<p>For example, Kentucky bettors will be able to wager on all of the biggest sports leagues in the USA, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, WNBA and OGA. Wagers on a number of collegiate sports are also allowed.</p>
<p>In addition to that, sports punters will get to place bets on a variety of other events, such as tennis, cornhole, darts, billiards, snooker, chess and cycling. The Olympics are also on the list.</p>
<p>Interestingly, players will be able to wager on motorsports such as NASCAR, NHRA and IndyCar races, among others, but not on international Formula 1 events.</p>
<p>Many Events Made It on the List, Some Did Not</p>
<p>In the meantime, operators will also be allowed to accept wagers on combat sports such as boxing and the UFC. However, slap fighting and other combat sports failed to make it on the list because of their inherent brutality. Stokke in particular was reluctant to approve disciplines that “result in mayhem.”</p>
<p>LIV Golf, the controversial golf tour backed by Saudi Arabia, also made it to the list. However, its addition may be reevaluated if it merges with the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>Fans of video gaming also have a reason to rejoice as Kentucky is set to greenlight betting on eight of the biggest esports titles. These include the Call of Duty League, CS:GO, League of Legends, Dota 2, the NBA 2K League, the Overwatch League, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and VALORANT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, fans of pickleball aren’t as lucky as the sport failed to make it to the list. However, Stokke reassured proponents of the discipline that it may get added in the future once his team is “more comfortable with the governing bodies that pickleball is subject to.”</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the list is likely to grow in time as more disciplines and women’s leagues are likely to be added in the future. However, the state plans to only include events that are overseen by a governing body that ensures their integrity.</p>
<p>Kentucky sports betting launches in a week. Starting September 7, retail sportsbooks will be able to accept wagers. A mobile launch will follow on September 28, although players can register in advance.</p>
