    <h1>Parx Casino Xcite Center Doubledown Casino Free Chips Bonus Collector Casino In Lake Tahoe Windstar</h1>

<p>hi</p>
<p>first of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for looking into this matter for me.</p>
<p>I would also like to complain about online casinos in general, in the fact that you can set up an account in minutes and they are all happy to take thousands off of the punter with no verification needed. Two examples being Harry’s casino and royal oak casino . Both of which I have had hassle trying to close the accounts, with constant emails asking for them to do so ignored .Yet if you want to make a withdrawal you have to go through a long identification process, and are often restricted to how much you can withdraw ( yet they will take deposits off of you all day long). Surely there should be a law in place to stop this? I could be 15 years old making all these deposits for all they know .Online casinos are legalized thieves in my book.</p>
<p>last of all I would like to make a special shout out to WINNERS MAGIC. Who I made a deposit with last year, I was given the sign up bonus and started playing, after a while playing the slots with some success I switched to play evolutions gaming monopoly . After playing for sometime losing /winning on and off I placed a hundred pounds on the four roll bonus game, to my surprise it came up with a big win. 319 x. I won £31900. I tried to withdraw £30000. Only to have an email from them to say that I hadn’t played through the bonus requirements and they voided the win. I was told I should not have been placing more than £4 on a spin. I had been placing hundreds of pounds for a fair period of time. They where happy to take all the losing bets I placed and surely again there should be a system in place that doesn’t allow you to place that bet if they are not going to pay out ( you can’t win). At the very least I should have had been paid 319x the £4 amount? No nothing, all the money wiped.</p>
<p>Do not play online casinos people</p>
<p>even if you win they don’t pay out!</p>
