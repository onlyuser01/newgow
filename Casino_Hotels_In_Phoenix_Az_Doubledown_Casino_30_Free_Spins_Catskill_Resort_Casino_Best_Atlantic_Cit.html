<p>The Green Bay Packers vs. Dallas Cowboys is a Wild Card Round duel that will take place on Sunday, January 14, 2024, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers got to the 2024 NFL Playoffs via wild card, which is why they’re taking on the winner of the NFC East on the road.</p>
<p>Playing at AT&amp;T Stadium is in good memory of the Packers as they won each of their last four games at that venue. However, Sunday’s Packers vs. Cowboys Playoff game will be the first time since 1999 that they’re playing there without Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback.</p>

<p>Can Green Bay Packers Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers finished 9-8 in the regular season, booking a wild card ticket to the postseason. They should consider themselves lucky to get to the playoffs, as it happened only after they won their final three games of the regular season.</p>
<p>And the games in question were against three teams with a very bad record – the Carolina Panthers (2-15), Minnesota Vikings (7-10), and Chicago Bears (7-10).</p>
<p>In fact, most of Green Bay’s wins in 2023 happened against teams with a negative overall record. There were, however, a couple of notable exceptions, most notably, the win over the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>The win in question happened at Lambeau, where they won another four games in the regular season. Their home record was .625, while on the road, they were .444. This is something that needs to worry them a lot ahead of the trip to Arlington, where the Cowboys are undefeated this season.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys Want to Remain Undefeated at Home</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys have been brilliant this season, finishing on a 12-5 record in the regular season, and landing the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The winners of the NFC East Division are the league’s scoring leaders with 29.9 points per game on average.</p>
<p>Their numbers are even better when it comes to playing on home turf. At AT&amp;T Stadium, Mike McCarthy’s men went 8-0 in the regular season, with an average of 37.4 points scored per game.</p>
<p>Dallas’s quarterback Dak Prescott has been phenomenal this season, throwing for a total of 36 touchdowns, which is more than any other player in the league.</p>

<p>The 2023-24 regular season was one of the best in his career, with Prescott breaking a couple of personal records. For instance, he recorded the highest pass completion percentage of his pro career (69.5%), as well as got his highest passer rating ever (105.9).</p>
<p>Apart from having a QB who’s playing at an MVP level, the Cowboys also have some great wide receivers (e.g., CeeDee Lamb), tight ends (e.g., Jake Ferguson), and running backs (e.g., Tony Pollard). On top of everything, the Cowboys are also great defensively.</p>
<p>Their defense was fifth in the league in the regular season, with 18.5 points against them per game. In comparison, the Packers were conceding 20.6 PPG in the regular season.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs. Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys will win this game, we have zero doubt about that. But will they be able to cover the 7.5-point spread?</p>
<p>We think they will. After all, they covered the spread in six of their eight home games in the regular season. We see no reason why they wouldn’t do it in their first game of the 2024 postseason.</p>
<p>Pick: Dallas Cowboys -7.5</p>
