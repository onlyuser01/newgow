    <h1>Council Bluffs Casino Hotel Maryland Live Casino Hotel Casino In Flagstaff Map Of Casinos In Atlanti</h1>

<p>René Jansen, KSA’s chairman, commented on the matter, promising that his team will continue combating unlicensed gambling</p>
<p>The Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Netherlands’ gambling regulator, has issued penalties to two offshore operators, namely Winning Poker Network and Goldwin. Both companies offered their online products to local players despite lacking Dutch licenses.</p>
<p>The KSA issued periodic penalty payments, warning the two companies that their fine will increase for each week they continue to operate in the Netherlands. As a result, Goldwin ceased its operations in the country, unlike Winning Poker Network, which continued to accept players on an alternative website.</p>
<p>Goldwin accepted bets on its westcasino.com website, despite lacking a license in the Netherlands. However, when the KSA issued a periodic penalty of $256,000 (converted to USD from Euro) to a maximum of $767,870, the operator quickly stopped taking bets.</p>
<p>Winning Poker Network, on the other hand, promised to stop offering gambling in the Netherlands after receiving a prior warning. However, while the operator made its americascardroom.eu inaccessible to local audiences, its truepoker.eu brand continued to accept Dutch players.</p>
<p>As a result, the KSA had to resort to imposing a fine.</p>
<p>Winning Poker Network Was Handed a Periodic Fine</p>
<p>Winning Poker Network’s regulation breach earned it a periodic fine of $26,770 a week to a maximum of $80,320. As highlighted by the KSA, the size of this penalty is determined by many factors, including the size of an illegal operator’s business.</p>
<p>The KSA noted that at the time of its original announcement, Winning Poker Network had not yet taken down its other site in the Netherlands. The regulator vowed to continue its investigation after the penalty settlement, noting that it may need to resort to additional enforcement action if the operator continues to violate the Netherlands’ gambling laws.</p>
<p>The Dutch market is known as one of the strictest in Europe. It only allows operators that are licensed by the KSA and requires them to abide by strict rules that ensure fair game and robust customer protections.</p>
<p>René Jansen, KSA’s chairman, commented on the matter, saying that his team will continue combating unlicensed gambling. He said that the authority is committed to promoting regulated gaming while weeding out unlicensed companies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the authority slapped Bingoal with a $428,000 fine over ads targeted at young adults.</p>
<p>In other news, the KSA just requested updated legislation that would provide it with more power to combat illegal gambling. The regulator is certain that its proposed improvements will have a noticeable impact on the local market.</p>
