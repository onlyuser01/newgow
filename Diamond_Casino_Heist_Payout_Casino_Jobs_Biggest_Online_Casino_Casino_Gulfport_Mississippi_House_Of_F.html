    <h1>Diamond Casino Heist Payout Casino Jobs Biggest Online Casino Casino Gulfport Mississippi House Of F</h1>

<p>Novomatic’s digital gaming and entertainment division, Greentube, has expanded its presence in the German iGaming market. The company has struck a partnership to supply its award-winning and well-established titles to RULEO Alpenland AG, which operates the mybet.de brand, among others, in the country and is one of the most prominent iGaming companies in the sector.</p>
<p>RULEO Brands and Players to Enjoy Greentube Content</p>
<p>As a result, mybet.de players will have access to a number of acclaimed titles across numerous categories. RULEO-licensed operators will have access to Lucky Lady’s Charm, Sizzling Hot, Book of Ra, and other titles. However, players will also benefit from hot new releases such as Cash Connection – Book of Ra, Lord of the Ocean Bonus Spins, and Diamond Link Mighty Sevens.</p>
<p>RULEO is also signing this content opportunity with Greentube early into the supplier’s presence on the German market. Greentube has been able to compel operators, casinos, and players with its Book of Ra series which has proven an absolute success globally and is now set to dominate the German market as well. Greentube Key Account Manager Julia Schagerl commented on this partnership and said:</p>
<p>We’re absolutely delighted to bring our high-quality portfolio of online slots to RULEO’s customers in Germany. This exciting partnership further showcases our long-term commitment to further extend in key regulated markets around the world. Greentube Key Account Manager Julia Schagerl</p>
<p>RULEO CEO Andreas Fuchs-Degler also joined the conversation and said that Greentube has an outstanding reputation for developing some of the best slot games out there. The company has been delivering industry-leading content for years, and Fuchs-Degler was thrilled to see RULEO’s brands feature its games for the first time.</p>
<p>Greentube has been building its footprint in international iGaming markets with the company launching in Michigan with BetMGM late last month. Greentube is actively developing its unique proposition by expanding its North American and European footprints. The company obtained an Ontario license at the beginning of August.</p>
