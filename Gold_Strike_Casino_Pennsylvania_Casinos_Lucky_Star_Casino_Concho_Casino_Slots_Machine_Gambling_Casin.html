<p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is special for a number of reasons. First of all, it’s the first tournament in the history of the competition that’s taking place in the Middle East. Secondly, it’s the first World Cup that’s held in fall/winter (in the Northern hemisphere).</p>
<p>Still, the no.1 reason why the 2022 Qatar World Cup differs from all the previous ones is that the competition is incredibly fierce. A total of 32 teams will compete in the tournament, and it seems that almost 50% of them stand a good chance of lifting the trophy on December 18.</p>
<p>Obviously, some teams are seen as stronger candidates than others. The reigning champion France and the 5-time World Cup winner Brazil are the two main favorites, followed by Argentina, England, Spain, Germany, and others.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn’t mean that underdogs like Portugal or longshots like the United States cannot upset the odds.</p>

<p>2022 World Cup Bracketology</p>
<p>Same as all the previous tournaments since 1998, the 2022 World Cup will also feature 32 teams separated into eight groups (A to H). Each team has to play a game against each other group member. After three rounds of the group phase, we’ll know which teams have qualified for the World Cup Playoffs, which start with the Round of 16.</p>
<p>The group winners will get to play against the runners-up (from a different group) in the first round of the knockout stage. After the Round of 16 come the quarterfinals, then the semis, and then it’s time for the title game.</p>
<p>Reasons Why Bookmakers Favor Brazil to Win the 2022 World Cup</p>
<p>The Brazil National Soccer Team a.k.a. A Seleção is the betting favorite for the World Cup winner market. If the Brazilians pull it off, it’s going to be their sixth World Cup win, meaning that no one’s gonna be able to catch up with them until (at least) 2030.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why oddsmakers believe they’re going to pull it off, it’s because Brazil’s roster looks incredible in 2022. Coached by Tite who’s been in charge since 2016, this team has some real superstars in its squad – Neymar, Vinicius Junior, Alisson Becker, and others.</p>
<p>Still, the same can be said for many other teams competing in the 2022 World Cup, including the reigning champ, France.</p>
<p>France Ready for the Title Defense</p>
<p>If you thought that Brazil’s roster is staked, wait to hear about France. The French won the World Cup four years ago in Russia, and their roster looks even stronger now.</p>
<p>Led by coach Didier Deschamps, France’s squad is headlined by such superstars as Kylian Mbappe, Karim Benzema, Ousmane Dembélé, and others.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi’s Last Dance?</p>
<p>The 2022 World Cup is probably going to be the final major tournament with Lionel Messi in Argentina shirt. At the age of 35, the soccer GOAT candidate won’t have any other chance to bring the World Cup trophy to Argentina for the first time since the days of Diego Maradona.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Argentina, Messi’s teammates are nowhere near him in terms of quality. Nevertheless, bookmakers do think that this one-man army could become the champion of the planet.</p>
