<p>The 2022 World Cup winner is the most popular bet, but there are plenty of others floating around, and we think you mustn’t miss them! What we’re talking about are the World Cup prop bets such as the top goalscorer, Golden Glove, group winner, and so on.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to present you with our favorite World Cup props, explaining why they’re good along the way. So, let’s start with our favorite prop bet for the 2022 World Cup – the top goalscorer bet.</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Top Goalscorer – Lionel Messi (+1200)</p>
<p>The top scorer award a.k.a. the Golden Boot is the award given to the player who scores more goals than anyone else. In Qatar, we think it’s going to be Lionel Messi. Oddsmakers (sort of) agree with us, giving the odds of +1200 on Argentina’s captain, which makes him the fourth favorite for the Golden Boot.</p>
<p>We think they’re literally giving away money, as Messi is bound to score a lot of goals in Qatar. The reasons are numerous, starting with the fact that his team is in Group C, which is one of the easiest groups in the tournament.</p>
<p>We’re sure Argentina will blow-out Saudi Arabia, with Messi putting away at least a goal or two. We also there’s gonna be goals galore in the Argentina vs Mexico game. Once again, Messi should be the one to score a goal(s) for Argentina.</p>
<p>In the game with Poland, Argentina might not score too many goals, but if they do, those goals are going to be the work of Messi.</p>
<p>Then, when Argentina gets to the knockout stage, it’s Messi again who should lead the charge. Oddsmakers project this team as one of the two finalists, meaning that The Messiah should have plenty of chances to up his numbers.</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Best Goalkeeper – Thibaut Courtois (+550)</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s goalie is the recipient of the Yashin Trophy (best goalkeeper award) for the previous season. The 6’7 Belgian is a wall between the posts and seems to play his best soccer in big matches. That said, we expect to see him keep a clean sheet in at least two or three games at the World Cup.</p>
<p>Will this be enough for Courtois to win the Golden Glove award? It depends not on him but on his teammates as well. If Belgium go far (semis, the least), he will win it.</p>
<p>Another goalkeeper you should pay attention to is Jasper Cillessen. This may seem like a strange suggestion, considering that the Netherlands goalie is playing for NEC in the Dutch Eredivisie, but we think this is an excellent longshot bet.</p>
<p>Why? Because his team is playing in arguably the easiest group. Qatar, Ecuador, and Senegal probably won’t find the net against the Netherlands too often. Plus, with the help of such elite defenders as Virgil van Dijk, Matthijs de Ligt, and Stefan de Vrij, Cillessen might be capable of keeping a clean sheet in a couple of knockout games as well.</p>
<p>Group E Winner – Germany (+110)</p>
<p>You can bet on the winner of each group of the 2022 World Cup. Unfortunately, the odds are very short for most favorites. This is why betting on the underdog might seem like a wise option. Unfortunately, the underdogs probably won’t win the group in most cases.</p>
<p>However, bookies do think Germany is the underdog in Group E, which makes us want to put a lot of money on this team. Spain is projected to win this group, but we think the Germans mustn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>In fact, the only reason why they got in the same group with such a strong team as Spain is that they made a couple of blunders in the qualifications. This, however, doesn’t mean Germany isn’t a good team. On the contrary, we think that Hansi Flick’s boys are going to go far in Qatar.</p>
<p>Other Notable World Cup 2022 Props</p>
<p>Sportsbooks are giving odds for all kinds of 2022 World Cup markets, including the stage of elimination. What this basically means is that you can be on which stage of the tournament will one team’s journey end.</p>
<p>We think that the Netherlands will reach the quarterfinals would be a great bet. We also think that betting on Spain getting eliminated in the round of 16 is another interesting proposition.</p>
<p>Then, there’s also the No First Time Winner prop bet. Basically, you can bet on whether a team that’s already won the World Cup will win it again. This bet wins if Brazil, Germany, Argentina, England, France or Uruguay wins the trophy. We think that scenario is very likely to lay out.</p>
