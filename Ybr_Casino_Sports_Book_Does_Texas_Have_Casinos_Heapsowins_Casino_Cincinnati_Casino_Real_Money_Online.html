<p>Thank you very much for your reply, Robin60. Sadly, since you have played/lost your winnings, Iâ€™m afraid, there is not much we can do for you. Please understand, the player is the only one responsible for their account, active balance, and all the bets taking place.</p>
<p>I understand that this wouldn't happen if your withdrawal was successfully processed, but that doesn't change the fact that you decided to play with the returned funds and lost them all. For future references, please contact us as soon as the issue evolves so we can intervene before it's too late. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
