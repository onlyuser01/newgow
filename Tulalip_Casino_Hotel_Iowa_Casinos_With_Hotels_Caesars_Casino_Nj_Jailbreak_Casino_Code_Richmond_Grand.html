<p>Online gaming and sports betting technology supplier FSB Technology announced today its self-service betting terminals (SSBTs) will feature in South Dakota at properties run by slot machine operator AG Trucano (AGT).</p>
<p>Betting Kiosks Deployment</p>
<p>The deployment of FSB’s SSBT kiosks in South Dakota was made possible after a sports wagering agreement was signed between FSB and AGT to install the terminals across 11 AGT casinos in the city of Deadwood. On top of the SSBTs, two of the casinos will also get support from the over-the-counter EPOS system of the tech supplier.</p>
<p>“It’s been a pleasure working with FSB’s Business Development Manager, Lisa Waterfield and Mike on this agreement. We’ve been hugely impressed by their retail solution and look forward to distributing the FSB SSBT kiosks across 11 of our casinos.” Mike Trucano, Founder and Consultant, AGT</p>
<p>Following voter’s approval for “Amendment B” during the November 2, 2020 referendum to legalize sportsbooks, South Dakota legislators and regulators began working on the sports betting regulatory framework and in March this year, legal wagering on sports in the state became a reality after Gov. Kristi Noem signed the bill into law.</p>
<p>South Dakota saw its first sportsbook launch earlier this month after partnerships between BetMGM and Liv Hospitality’s Tin Lizzie Gaming Resort and Cadillac Jack’s Gaming Resorts signed in August launched the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>‘Tremendous Step Forward’</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal with AGT, Mike Van Erman, who was appointed in January to identify potential partnerships for the gaming technology supplier, outlined the “tremendous step forward” as FSB continues to expand into North American markets.</p>
<p>“AG Trucano has an outstanding reputation in South Dakota and we’re delighted to be building this partnership with them. This deal is a testament to the strength of our localized retail offering and the huge progress that FSB has made in 2021 in the US and globally. It’s great to see our momentum continuing,” concluded Van Erman.</p>
<p>The operator of 600 slot machines across land-based gambling venues in Deadwood, AGT has been running gambling operations in South Dakota since its legalization back in 1989.</p>
<p>FSB’s next-generation SSBTs were deployed in Ireland earlier this year, after the gaming technology supplier entered an agreement with local retail betting operator BetXS to deliver the kiosks, which included full SIS integration, tutorial and Create Bet videos, as well as ante-post betting, across betXS’ stores in the country.</p>
