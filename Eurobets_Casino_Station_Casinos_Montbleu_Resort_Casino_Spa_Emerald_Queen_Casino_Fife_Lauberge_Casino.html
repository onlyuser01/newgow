<p>NOVOMATIC Interactive’s Greentube, which specializes in content supplying for online casinos, has announced it has landed a deal with the provider of sports betting and online casino services SpaceCasino.</p>
<p>Greentube, SpaceCasino Boost UK iGaming Expansion Efforts</p>
<p>Greentube has introduced its gaming portfolio to UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) authorized SpaceCasino.</p>
<p>SpaceCasino is owned by the gambling technology provider STech Technology UK Limited, headquartered in London and operating under a UKGC license. Through this partnership, Greentube aims to develop even further its significant presence in the European iGaming market.</p>
<p>Now that the agreement has become a fact a lot of Greentube’s classic series, including Book of Ra™ and Mystic Fortunes, will be available on SuperCasino’s platform, thus extending considerably Greentube’s user network in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Partnering with SpaceCasino will extend our reach in the UK, a market where Greentube has seen significant growth in the last 12 months,” confirmed the Head of Key Account Management and Sales at Greentube Markus Antl.</p>
<p>Greentube also announced the company poised to provide a premium list of games that should become extremely successful among the SpacesCasino user base. Some of the products that are expected to resonate with players are Garden of Persephone™ and Realm.</p>
<p>Greentube hopes to support SpaceCasino, a brand that has been rapidly gaining iGaming market share in the UK, even though the website launched only in 2019.</p>
<p>STech’s Head of Business and Development Dan Vikman expressed his positive expectations in relation to the deal as well. He said that the content of a leading provider like Greentube will surely help to outspread SpaceCasino’s services to a vast audience.</p>
<p>Conquering New Markets</p>
<p>Since it was created, SpaceCasino has been working towards expanding its user base. That’s why it comes as no surprise that the goals of the network include entering new operational markets.</p>
<p>In the short-term, the company is planning to do that by going live in other European countries, with Finland to be the next on the list.</p>
<p>Greentube also shares their partner’s interest in Europe. In fact, before stepping into the UK online casino space, the content supplier had already been partnering with the Danish online gaming brand RoyalCasino.dk as well as with the first licensed Swiss online casino operator, Grand Casino Baden. In addition,, Greentube struck deals with leading Italian gambling operators after signing agreements with both Snaitech and E-Play24 in September this year.</p>
<p>Yet, the content supplier obviously didn’t want to stop there and only two months later in November, the company landed another agreement with the iGaming software developer SoftSwiss.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal various Greentube’s slot titles, video bingo, poker, and table games have to be promoted within brands such as N1 Casino, Paradise Casino and EuSlot available in the SoftSwiss online casino network.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the company established a partnership with US operator Rush Street Interactive with the goal to distribute its products to online casinos in Colombia as well.</p>
<p>Greentube previously signed an agreement with Novomatic in 2016 to develop skill-based games, deemed to be the future of iGaming.</p>
