<p>In the meantime, I recommend you to contact the Malta Gaming Authority ( https://www.mga.org.mt/support/online-gaming-support/ ) and submit a complaint to them. It's a good licensing authority and has better options and tools to help players. Please let me know how they respond. ( adam.m@casino.guru ). I am sorry that I could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>I understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in rating caused by unresolved complaints could help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint and you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>I thank you for your cooperation so far, but while it can be seen that the player may have registered more than one account, there is nothing to suggest that this has been done with the intention of gaining any unfair advantage. We believe that every case should be assessed individually. Yes, the player may claim that it is a mistake, and this is why we ask for evidence to prove otherwise. If there is no evidence that any harm has been caused or any advantage has been gained, we do not believe the player should be penalized in this case.</p>

<p>Dear Frida,</p>
<p>As the casino has stated their position will remain final, this complaint will now be closed as 'unresolved'.</p>
