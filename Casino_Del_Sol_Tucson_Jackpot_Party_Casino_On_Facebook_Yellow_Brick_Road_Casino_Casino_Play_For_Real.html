    <h1>Casino Del Sol Tucson Jackpot Party Casino On Facebook Yellow Brick Road Casino Casino Play For Real</h1>

<p>I feel you're still missing the point. The hotel address is incorrect because it is not your permanent residence, it isn't also stated in your personal documents.</p>
<p>I believe the casino had no chance to find out where you were from untill you submitted the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for the information you filled in during the registration. If you checked the terms and conditions, the part explaining the verification, you'd found this:</p>
<p>"Account Verification</p>
<p>According to the Regulation of Hellenic Gaming Commission published on Gov. Gazette 3162/ 25.11.2014, in order to make sure that you continue to have full access to your account, we are required to verify that:</p>
<p>the information in your account is accurate and valid</p>
<p>your account is verified</p>
<p>We would therefore like to ask you to log in to your account and take a few minutes to check that all information is correct and updated. In case some of the information e.g. the telephone number or your address has changed, then, having already logged in, please follow the path Account &gt; Profile, to make all the necessary updates and corrections; don't forget to click on ‚ÄòOK‚Äô to save your changes.</p>
<p>Once the above has been completed and updated, you will have to proceed to the Account Validation Process, in accordance with the Greek Law (if you have already completed the Verification Process at an earlier stage, then you will NOT need to repeat it).</p>
<p>In order to proceed with the Account Verification process, you will need to visit My Account, then Profile and Verification Process and upload the one of the below listed documents (photographed or scanned) out of the two following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identity documents:</li>
</ol>
<p>Color copies of the front and back side of your identity card or your passport or the front side of your driver's license (not the trifold document).</p>
<ol>
<li>Proof of residence documents:</li>
</ol>
<p>Recent utility bills that clearly display their date of issue.</p>
<p>Recent bank statement</p>
<p>Certificate of permanent residence from the local Municipality</p>
<p>Clearance note IRS (latest year) -please cover the financial data since they are confidential</p>
<p>Registration number issuance certificate</p>
<p>Permit of Residence (valid)</p>
<p>Tenancy agreement submitted online via TAXISnet</p>
<p>Certificate of residence for special use</p>
<p>E1 Income Tax form (incl. E1 Registration Number)</p>
<p>AMKA (Social Security number) certificate</p>
<p>OAED (Labour Employment Office) certificate</p>
<p>EFKA (Unified Social Security Fund) tax clearance certificate"</p>
<p>How did you think you could possibly provide proof of residence, while you input the hotel address instead of your own permanent residence?</p>
<p>I'm sorry it was your fault in the first place üôÅ.</p>
