<p>Sports betting technology, content and media company Spotlight Sports Group (SSG) announced a new agreement with LiveScore Group that will see the launch to global audiences of pre-match content across 22 different soccer leagues.</p>
<p>The Superfeed Pre-play agreement between SGS and LiveScore Group will enable customers of LiveScore Media access to betting tips and insights provided by experts in the field from the biggest soccer leagues globally.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to further extend our Superfeed agreement with Spotlight Sports Group,” said the director of Sportsbook at LiveScore Group James McKay, eager to see the impact of the new agreement upon the company’s “dedicated football audience” and how the audience “engages and interacts with the vast amount of excellent football content” offered by Superfeed.</p>
<p>“Whether our customers are engaging in the Premier League or the MLS, the consistent quality information they will now experience will be of huge benefit,” McKay concluded.</p>
<p>Driven by its commitment to offer the best customer experience, LiveScore Group selected SGS to be its primary betting content provider due to its proven track record of supplying engaging expert-led betting content across multiple sports.</p>
<p>‘Showcase the Power of Superfeed’ Content</p>
<p>Commenting on LiveScore Group’s choice of Superfeed, head of sales in Ireland and the UK at SGS, Daniel Smith, outlined that the group has been working hard in the past few years to come up with “one of the best football content products in the industry.”</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting opportunity for us to showcase the power of Superfeed football content on one of the world’s biggest football brands,” Smith continued, delighted to see the agreement that will provide LiveScore Group audiences with direct access to SGS’ “expert football insights and verdicts.”</p>
<p>The partnership that initially saw the launch of Superfeed Racing for LiveScore Group’s LiveScore Bet and Virgin Bet brands is now further strengthened with the new Superfeed integration.</p>
<p>The expansion with LiveScore Group is the latest in a series of agreements SGS has established with betting and media partners recently, including Stoke-on-Trent-based bookmaker bet365, US-facing content platform Sportskeeda and online lead generation specialist Catena Media.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, SGS announced a two-year deal with bet365 under which the bookmaker became the title sponsor of the Racing Post’s show, Upping the Ante, for the fourth and fifth consecutive series.</p>
<p>A month before that, SGS teamed with Sportskeeda to power the platform’s betting solution and enhance player engagement, while in June, Catena Media agreed to integrate Superfeed content to its GG.co.uk and racingtips.com horse racing websites.</p>
