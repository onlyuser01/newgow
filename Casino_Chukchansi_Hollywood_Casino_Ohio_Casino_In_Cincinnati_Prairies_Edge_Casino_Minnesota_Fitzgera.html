<p>MGM’s domestic casino websites remain offline this morning, and much of the company’s IT systems remain disrupted because of the cybersecurity issue. But MGM says its casino operations have been restored, and restaurants are back up and running.</p>
<p>Our resorts, including dining, entertainment, and gaming are currently operational, and continue to deliver the experiences for which MGM is known,” an MGM statement provided to Casino.org this morning read. “Our guests remain able to access their hotel rooms and our Front Desk staff is ready to assist our guests as needed. We appreciate your patience.”</p>
<p>The severity of the cyberattack remains unknown at this juncture. Reports have surfaced that the hackers have demanded a ransom, though those rumors have not been confirmed by MGM, and no group has claimed responsibility for the event.</p>
<p>Suppose MGM does pay a ransom to have its IT systems restored. In that case, the company is required to disclose such payments under recently established rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a publicly traded entity.</p>
<p>MGM operates 19 casinos and hotels in the U.S., with all affected by the cyber event as of Tuesday morning. Notable properties in Las Vegas include the Bellagio, MGM Grand, New York-New York, and Mandalay Bay. The casino giant outside of Las Vegas operates Bellagio in Atlantic City, MGM National Harbor outside of DC, and MGM Grand Detroit. MGM has about 16,000 total hotel rooms domestically.</p>
<p>The cyberattack has also affected MGM’s sports betting and online gaming operations, though the BetMGM platform appears online this morning.</p>
<p>MGM operates two casinos in Macau through its subsidiary, MGM China Holdings. MGM’s China operations remain unaffected by the cybersecurity event.</p>
<p>Digital Amenities Disrupted</p>
<p>The MGM Resorts release says its U.S. casino resorts are open for business. But many modern amenities, such as digital room keys and online reservations, remain inaccessible.</p>
<p>Mobile and self-check-in kiosks also remain offline this morning. MGM says guests must check in and out of the company’s casino resorts and hotels through the front desk. A physical key will be provided there.</p>
<p>Restaurants are also open, but guests must book reservations by calling the eateries or visiting them in person. On-site concierges are also available to handle such bookings.</p>
<p>Along with state and local law enforcement and the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the MGM cyberattack is being investigated by the FBI.</p>
<p>Gaming Resumes</p>
<p>MGM Resorts said after detecting the cybersecurity issue. The company began proactively shutting down its slot machines to protect data. MGM hasn’t said publicly why it was able to bring its slots back online, but gaming has nonetheless recommenced.</p>
<p>Gaming vouchers are back being printed, and self-service cashier kiosks have also been restored. Cashier cages are fully staffed for guests wishing to stay clear of the IT systems.</p>
