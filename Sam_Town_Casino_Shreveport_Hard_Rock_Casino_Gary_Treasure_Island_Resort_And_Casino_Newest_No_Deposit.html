<p>100 Zombies review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>100 Zombies is set in a horrifying future city, over which the undead revenants of a biological disaster rule. A plucky group of heroes must fight for survival. With your help, they might just make it to dawn.</p>
<p>If zombies are your jam, then this slot might be for you. Just remember, it isn’t just your coins that are on the line, your braaaaaains are too.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics of 100 Zombies are one of its major selling points. The fun cartoonish horrors and comic book style heroes make for an engaging set of characters. Meanwhile, the green smog of the background lends the game some real atmosphere.</p>
<p>Each of the characters are animated when part of a winning combination, each animation emphasising the character and helping sell the player on the world that Endorphina has built.</p>
<p>The 100 Zombies soundtrack is made to echo the electro-Western soundtrack of The Walking Dead, and is augmented with the odd zombie moan or groan. There are a pleasing variety of sounds and sound effects for the win and spins noises so the slot's loops manage to avoid going stale.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>100 Zombies is a five reel slot with four rows and a whopping 100 win lines (hence the name).</p>
<p>Gameplay is well paced and very straightforward.</p>
<p>There is a high-low gamble feature that can allow the player to run their wins up and increase the volatility of the game. Unlike most games, where a straightforward double or nothing coin flip is available, the high/low format means that not every draw is a 50-50 prospect. If the dealer’s card is low, the odds are better for the player.</p>
<p>There is a free spin bonus (details below). So, more or less everything you’d expect from a standard issue slot, but not a thing more.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Scatters appear only on reels 2, 3, and 4. Hitting three Scatters anywhere will trigger the free spin bonus. This comes with 10 free spins, and can be retriggered.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game 96.03%, right on our yardstick for average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€200.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a rather weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its charming setting and cutesy art work, this slot is a lot of fun to play. The zombies and characters are compelling. The gameplay is basic but high quality.</p>
<p>The RTP is only average, and the volatility only medium. These factors do temper our enthusiasm a bit.</p>
<p>But overall this is a decent slot, and enjoyable enough to get our recommendation.</p>
