<p>While popularity of sports betting in Kansas continues to grow, a new report warns that there's little funds for raising awareness of gambling harm</p>
<p>Kansas legalized wagering on sports back in May last year. It wasn’t until a few months later, in September, that the state officially launched its mobile and retail sports wagering market. And while many bettors enjoy wagering responsibly, as with any gambling activity, there are people affected negatively by addictions.</p>
<p>More Funds Are Needed for Gambling Treatment and Education</p>
<p>Stephenie Roberts, a clinical social worker and Chair of the South Central Kansas Problem Gambling Task Force, a group focused on raising awareness, educating and preventing problem gambling, said when interviewed by KWCH, that funds in the state for raising awareness have been declining. She outlined that the decline in funding resulted in losing problem gambling specialists and even flagged that a study on the topic in Kansas hasn’t been made in the last five years.</p>
<p>This is a significant issue, pointed out Roberts, saying that there are people in Kansas that haven’t even heard of treatment and support services for problem gambling. She pointed out that although there are ads that promote those services, “sometimes the print is so small that people can’t see it.” According to Roberts, one way to help gambling treatment programs and raise awareness is by legislative changes that dedicate more funds toward education and prevention.</p>
<p>Betting Is Fun, Only If Its under Control</p>
<p>Roberts said that without a proper study on gambling harm, it will be difficult to determine the effect sports betting has on Kansas residents. Still, she explained that the immediate and easy access to betting via smartphones is undoubtedly worrying. Acknowledging that placing wagers can be fun, the clinical social worker pointed out that users need to monitor their spending. Comparing wagering on sports to other recreational activities, Roberts said that bettors need to set limits.</p>
<p>“It can be fun, but you have to balance that with limiting yourself with how much you’d spend.“ Stephenie Roberts, Chair of the South Central Kansas Problem Gambling Task Force</p>
<p>Since the launch of regulated sports betting until the end of 2022, there were nearly $720 million wagered in Kansas, judging by details released by the gambling regulator in the state, the Kansas Lottery. The betting handle brought $20.9 million in net revenue for the operators and based on the 10% tax rate for the activity, the state collected $2,092,630. From that total, only a fraction was used to help promote responsible gambling and education in Kansas.</p>
