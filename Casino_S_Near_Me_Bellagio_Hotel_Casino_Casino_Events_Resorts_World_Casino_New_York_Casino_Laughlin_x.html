<p>The leading developer and designer of mobile and web applications, xDesign, announced a new multi-year collaboration with North America’s premier sports gaming platform, FanDuel.</p>
<p>xDesign and FanDuel to Create 400 New Jobs</p>
<p>The announcement came Tuesday and will see the duo jointly invest £250,000 ($312,500). Ultimately, the new collaboration will seek to create high-value jobs and cultivate new talent. The recent deal builds upon an existing 18-month commercial collaboration between xDesign and FanDuel.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the duo agreed to create a total of 400 jobs by the end of this year. That will happen with xDesign adding 40 employees that will collaborate with FanDuel’s account. As a result, xDesign’s employees that support the sports betting leader will grow to 120 in total.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new deal will increase xDesign’s growth plans and the company will increase its consultancy employees to 350 by adding 150 employees by the end of 2022. xDesign said that it expects even further growth of the consultancy headcount to more than 500 people by 2024. What’s more, the partnership will see FanDuel add 250 engineers. The new employees will be able to work from its US and Scotland-based offices.</p>
<p>The Partnership Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s chief operating officer, Andy Giancamilli, said that the company’s collaboration with xDesign has been impressive. He pointed out that xDesign has a unique approach combined with significant technical experience and a proven track record for collaborating with global companies. According to Giancamilli, a successful collaboration such as the one between FanDuel and xDesign can certainly be envied by other operators within the sector. Last but not least, FanDuel’s chief operating officer predicted further growth for the two companies within the UK and Scottish technology sectors.</p>
<p>“We have been continually impressed with xDesign throughout our relationship to date; its people-first approach, technical pedigree, and superb track record of delivery to rapidly scaling companies provides FanDuel with a relationship to be envied by others in the sector.” Andy Giancamilli, chief operating officer at FanDuel Group</p>
<p>Catering to millions of customers in the US, FanDuel is undoubtedly a leader in the sports betting market in the country. As a leader in the market, the company holds more than 35% of the sports betting market share. Although it was founded in Edinburgh, FanDuel is currently headquartered in New York.</p>
<p>“Extending our relationship with an organization as successful as FanDuel will significantly contribute to identifying and cultivating the next generation of talent in the UK which both companies are fanatical about.” Euan Andrews, CEO at xDesign</p>
<p>Euan Andrews, xDesign’s CEO, added: “Investing in people and creating a platform for future tech talent is a must to tackle the ever-widening tech skills gap.” In conclusion, he outlined that while creating jobs is good, the new employees should also be supported at the start of their new careers.</p>
