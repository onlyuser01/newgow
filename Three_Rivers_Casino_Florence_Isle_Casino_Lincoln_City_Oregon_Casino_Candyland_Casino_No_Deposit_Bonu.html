<p>LeoVegas is upgrading its affiliate marketing compliance with Gaming Innovation Group’s GiG Comply software as more and more iGaming markets are tightening their regulations.</p>
<p>LeoVegas Takes Control over Affiliate Advertising and Provides Better Security Measures</p>
<p>With a commitment to responsible gambling, LeoVegas wants to have more control over affiliate advertising and to protect the brand from websites that are not internationally compliant. The GiG Comply tool is a perfect fit for that, as it can scan more than 30,000 websites per day and also help operators make automated checks, as well as give players the ability to stick to different marketing standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The self-service marketing compliance software gives operators the ability to control affiliates and see if they are aligned with the brand and if responsible gaming measures are in place on affiliate websites, as well as make sure that terms and conditions are up-to-date.</p>
<p>LeoVegas recently became the first gaming operator offering open banking payment for sports betting customers in Sweden and the UK. The company is planning to extend this product to all of its major European markets. Open banking payment is more reliable owing to its better security, improved speed of payments, and avoiding third-party transaction fees.</p>
<p>GiG Comply Adds a Language Detection Feature and Expands Partnerships</p>
<p>Jonas Warner, Managing Director of GiG Media has stated that the company is happy to involve more partners, who support their initiative to protect their brands and the end-users. He also added that this marketing software will help improve affiliate compliance and align it with responsible marketing conditions.</p>
<p>GiG Comply recently added a new language detection feature as many iGaming markets tighten their compliance measures worldwide. This feature will allow operators to see if compliance with regulations in different markets is upheld by identifying the promoting website’s language.</p>
<p>The expansion of the GiG Compliance tool doesn’t end here. Recently Malta-based Avento MT Limited also signed an agreement and received access to the compliance tool, ensured to provide more safety to its users, and also optimize its affiliate check process.</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group also announced in November that they have a vendor registration license for its affiliate site World Sports Network (WSN) from the Michigan Gaming Control Board. This allows WSN to inform customers about statistics, sports news, and other tools in ten states where sports betting is legal and regulated.</p>
