<p>Racing and Sports (RAS), a tech, data, digital and media company that serves the horse racing industry, has posted record-breaking Q1 financial results in its native market. The company’s revenue increased by 62% thanks to a successful business strategy.</p>
<p>RAS’ Revenues Skyrocketed</p>
<p>In Q1 of the new fiscal year, Racing and Sports reported revenue of $1.82 million (converted from AUD), representing a huge year-on-year increase. The company’s annualized monthly recurring revenue also experienced a noticeable rise to $6.12 million.</p>
<p>In addition, RAS has no shortage of funding and reported a cash-and-cash-equivalents balance of $6.37 million as of September 30.</p>
<p>The company’s soaring revenues were attributed to its quickly-growing customer base. According to RAS’ leadership, enterprise customers remain a core focus of the company. The higher-ups praised the team’s success in finalizing many new strategic deals that would reinforce the company’s business.</p>
<p>The company’s results led analysts to believe that its current valuation is inadequate and should be much higher. MST Access, for example, believes that a reasonable valuation should be $0.65 (USD), instead of the current $0.37 (as of the time of this writing). According to the analytics firm, RAS is poised for growth and will likely continue its momentum in the following years.</p>
<p>The Leadership Is Happy with the Results</p>
<p>Q1 of the new fiscal year also proved to be a favorable period in terms of strategic agreements. The period saw RAS ink a major agreement with the global gaming and betting giant Flutter. This followed an agreement extension with Entain, inked in the earlier quarter. As a result, RAS now powers several major gambling companies, including Racing Victoria, Tabcorp, Flutter, Entain, bet365, Betfair and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, among others.</p>
<p>Stephen Crispe, RAS’ chief executive officer, spoke with Stockhead about his company’s performance in the quarter. He noted that his team is known for delivering best-in-class racing data and solutions. The company’s Wagering 360 platform leverages these capabilities to provide operators with an all-in-one solution for entering the racing market.</p>
<p>In other news, RAS recently provided the Victorian Racing Club with a new product called Inside Run. The latter is a digital race guide that informs bettors of everything they should know prior to a Melbourne Cup Carnival race. Inside Run leverages AI tech to simulate a possible outcome of the last 400m before the race has even taken place. The solution also makes an approximate prediction of which will be the top three horses.</p>
<p>RAS’ unparalleled data paired with its robust solutions continue boosting the company’s business.</p>
