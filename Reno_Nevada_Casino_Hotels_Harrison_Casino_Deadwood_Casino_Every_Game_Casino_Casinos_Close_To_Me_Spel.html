<p>Dear Michael,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked promotional terms, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"The maximum allowable single bet with a bonus (until the wagering requirements are met) is:</p>
<p>Slots and video slots - $ 5 per bet, or $ 5 in equivalent currency.</p>
<p>Any other game - $ 30 per bet, or equivalent to $ 30 in the appropriate currency.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the rule can result in the removal of winnings."</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#max-bets: The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we think that this rule should be enforced at software level, i.e., that the casino's software or website shouldn't let players place higher bets than the limit. This is one of our requirements for 'fair and safe casinos'.</p>
<p>If software enforcement is not possible, each case should be judged separately, so that only players who have broken the rule knowingly and systematically to gain an advantage are punished.</p>
<p>Michael, please could you forward your game history from the bonus play together with a link of the specific bonus that you have redeemed and played? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
