<p>Global Lottery Monitoring System (GLMS), a state lottery association, has received an official go-ahead from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission (AGCO) to launch in Ontario. As a result, GLMS will begin supporting its local partner in the province, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).</p>
<p>GLMS Enters Ontario to Boost Integrity of Sports</p>
<p>GLMS will provide OLG with a number of educational and monitoring services to help improve the integrity of competitions covered by the latter. The company’s main goal is to raise awareness of corruption in sports and help stakeholders act on suspicious activity.</p>
<p>GLMS is choosing a multi-pronged approach whereby it seeks to involve established cross-border regulators who see to clamp down on fraud in sports which undermines the integrity and experience for fans. Commenting on these developments, GLMS president Ludovico Calvi welcomed the opportunity to be joining the Ontario market, which opened for private companies on April 4.</p>
<p>Calvi reminded that his company has always been a staunch supporter of regulated and fair sports competitions and pushed for clean betting worldwide. He acknowledged that black market proliferation has been an issue, but also outlined a course of action that involves a joint action by stakeholders in the industry to help fix sports once and for all.</p>
<p>Building Standards for the Future of the Industry in Canada</p>
<p>To this end, GLMS and AGCO have worked together to establish standards that would allow the regulator to maintain the fairness of sports in Ontario but also serve as the basis for future launches in other provinces as well. Calvi added:</p>
<p>“We are very excited to provide integrity services to our current and future members in Ontario and other provinces.” GLMS president Ludovico Calvi</p>
<p>This is the latest move that reinforces the clout of the private sector in the Ontario gambling market, which was controlled exclusively by the state lottery until recently. Starting this year, however, more private operators have entered the space, including some of the most prominent names in sports betting such as DraftKings, theScore, FanDuel, and BetMGM to name a few.</p>
