<p>Leading iGaming content provider Pragmatic Play has partnered with multiple award-winning casino online 888casino to create a dedicated live blackjack studio. The studio will cater to the needs of 888casino’s players with state-of-the-art, branded blackjack tables.</p>
<p>888casino Ready to Create an Unforgettable Live Blackjack Experience</p>
<p>The dedicated blackjack studio will introduce casino888 customers to a fully immersive live casino experience customized to cater to their needs. This will be possible with Pragmatic Play’s stellar live dealer solutions. Accordingly, players will be able to access the live blackjack studio from any desktop, laptop, mobile, or Virtual Reality device.</p>
<p>They will also enjoy top-notch video quality thanks to the developer’s in-house 4K streaming solutions. Pragmatic Play uses multiple cameras to capture all the angles and all the heated action behind the tables. 888casino’s new live blackjack studio will be hosted by fully-trained, professional, and friendly dealers who will create a pleasant and engaging atmosphere during gameplay.</p>
<p>The live blackjack studio will rely on a series of important tools used in marketing, including in-studio promos, leaderboards, and a variety of different blackjack combinations. The live studio will run on a stellar HTML5 user-friendly interface based on user experience and user behavior research data.</p>
<p>888’s marketing vice president Talya Benyamini is convinced the operator will fully benefit from Pragmatic Play’s “flexible live casino offering” by expanding its rich selection of products. Talya also added that 888’s partnering with top providers like Pragmatic Play is a crucial component of their ongoing content development strategy that guarantees one-of-a-kind experiences for all customers.</p>
<p>The Deal, the Latest in Pragmatic Play’s String of Important Partnerships</p>
<p>This is just one of the latest deals that Pragmatic Play sealed recently, with names like Unibet and Mansion’s M88 on the list. The supplier also launched an exclusive blackjack studio called Ruby Studio, further expanding its impressive portfolio that consists of numerous live casino, virtual sports, bingo, and slots. All Pragmatic Play products are available through a single Application Programming Interface.</p>
<p>Marking its amazing year of growth, the developer scooped two awards at the Gaming Intelligence Latin America Awards in November 2021: iGaming Supplier of the Year and Game of the Year. The latter addressed its iconic game “Gates of Olympus”, a 5×6 slot with high volatility, loads of multipliers and tumbling wins, and 20 pay lines.</p>
<p>“Gates of Olympus” also features the special “Pay Anywhere” system that attracted the praise of operators worldwide. In December, The EGR Operator Awards also crowned Pragmatic Play with the Game of The Year title for the same game.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play was also awarded the Casino &amp; Games Supplier of the Year award last October at SBC Awards Latinoamerica 2021, further proving its tier-one developer status in LatAm. At the beginning of February, the company also announced it would expand its highly appreciated Drops and Wins Program through 2023.</p>
