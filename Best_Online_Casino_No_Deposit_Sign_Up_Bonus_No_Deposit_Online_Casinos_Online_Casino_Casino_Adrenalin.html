<p>Authentic Gaming is forging ahead thanks to a new partnership in South Africa with Betway, the company’s first choice for expanding its geographical footprint once again. Authentic, which specializes in the development of premium live casino games, will now debut in the country under the Betway banner. The rapid new market entry reflects on the company’s flexibility and agile culture, which company founder Jonas Delin spoke about back in June.</p>
<p>Authentic Breaks Ground in a New Market</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Authentic Gaming CCO Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow said, “International expansion is a priority for Authentic Gaming right now, and we are delighted to have entered the fast-growing South African market with our long-standing partner, Betway.”</p>
<p>She added that Authentic sees a huge potential for the casino segment in the region and that the company’s studio-based and auto roulette titles would enrich Betway’s portfolio variety while bringing fresh experiences to players in South Africa.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the operator’s established footprint, Authentic will have immediate access to new customer bases. In return, Betway will be able to provide its players with cutting-edge studio-based live content titles, including auto-roulette games, as Betway continues to scale up its offer confidently in Africa.</p>
<p>Authentic Gaming is bringing a distinct selection of games that will feature Grand, 24/7, Nightclub, Viva Vegas and Casino Floor. All of these games are played in the company of highly-trained live dealers who will contribute to engagement and consumer care.</p>
<p>Premium Content and Sustained Growth</p>
<p>Betway will also secure a unique product from the company, Cricket Roulette, which will only be available to their players. It’s effectively the first cricket-themed roulette table in the live dealer segment, making for a fun and engaging experience, the company argues.</p>
<p>The live roulette is set against a backdrop of a big screen where the latest results from the Indian Premier League, the country’s leading cricket competitions, are promptly displayed in real-time. Betway will also be adding other games, including the popular Auto Roulette genre with a Classic, Speed and VIP variation of the game.</p>
<p>Betway’s Phillip Superamonien added, “South Africa is a market with huge potential, and we believe betting on casino games will be very popular among players in the region as we’ve seen tremendous growth in recent months.”</p>
<p>Superamonien pointed out that Betway and Authentic Gaming have been working together for several years now and that the latest collaboration was an extension of that fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>The latest move comes after Authentic Gaming launched in the Spanish market in mid-September.</p>
