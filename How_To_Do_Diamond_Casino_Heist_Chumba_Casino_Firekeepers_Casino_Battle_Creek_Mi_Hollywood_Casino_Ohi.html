    <h1>How To Do Diamond Casino Heist Chumba Casino Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek Mi Hollywood Casino Ohi</h1>

<p>IGT’s SVP of global iLottery described France and Italy as the homes of “two of the most sophisticated and successful lotteries in the world“</p>
<p>Right after announcing a deal extension with the Belgian National Lottery, International Game Technology, a global leader in gambling tech, unveiled a new partnership deal between its subsidiary, IGT Global Services Limited, and FDJ Gaming Solutions France (FGS), a B2B subsidiary of FDJ Group.</p>
<p>Under the arrangement, which was described as a “cross-licensing agreement,” the two companies will be able to access each other’s full suite of eInstant games. Thanks to this, both providers will be able to grow, providing their operator partners with a variety of attractive lottery games.</p>
<p>The first phase of the partnership will see IGT offer its eInstant games portfolio to La Française des Jeux, France’s national lottery operator. At the same time, FGS will offer its complete portfolio of games to Lotterie Nazionali Srl, an Italian draw-based and instant games monopoly operated by IGT.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, IGT, which provides content and solutions to 8 of the world’s 10 largest lotteries, will be able to further diversify its portfolio and expand its presence in France.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Will Grow in France and Italy</p>
<p>Representatives from the two firms commented on the agreement with FDJ’s vice president of B2B, Pascal Blyau, calling the cross-licensing content agreement an “exciting step” for FGS. He added that the deal will allow FGS to expand its footprint across Europe and provide thrilling eInstant games to the players.</p>
<p>Blyau lauded IGT as a top global lottery company and lauded its cutting-edge content:</p>
<p>As the leader in global lottery, IGT has a wide variety of top-performing, award-winning content that will enhance our current offering so players can continue enjoying the ultimate lottery playing experiences. Pascal Blyau, VP of B2B, FDJ</p>
<p>IGT’s SVP of global iLottery, Srini Nedunuri, meanwhile, described France and Italy as the homes of “two of the most sophisticated and successful lotteries in the world,” operated by FDJ and IGT respectively. He said that the current deal represents a commitment to the provision of best-in-class eInstant games to customers in these markets.</p>
<p>Our agreement with FGS reflects a commitment to delivering premier eInstant games and responsible iLottery experiences to millions of lottery players in these two countries and offers a gateway for deploying additional world-class content. Srini Nedunuri, SVP of global iLottery, IGT</p>
<p>A few days earlier, IGT also unveiled a partnership with Dreamscape Companies, agreeing to supply Rio Hotel &amp; Casino with some of its best systems. At the same time, the global gambling leader continues to expand the footprint of games like Mystery of the Lamp, Powerbucks and MegaJackpots across North America.</p>
