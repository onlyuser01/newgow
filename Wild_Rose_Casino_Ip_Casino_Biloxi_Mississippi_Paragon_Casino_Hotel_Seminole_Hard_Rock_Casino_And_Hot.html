<p>The $10,000 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event gets cards in the air next week, and in anticipation sportsbooks are offering prop bets on the outcome of the most prestigious card game on the planet.</p>

<p>More than 7,000 people are expected to pony up the $10,000 buy-in at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The 50th playing of the tournament begins July 3. The nine-person final table begins July 12 and runs through at least July 16.</p>
<p>Bookmaker Bovada has issued a series of prop bets on the Main Event, and the lines feature a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>Age of winner: 29 years or older -140, 28 years or younger even Final winning hand: two pair or better -120, one pair or worse -120 Number of American-born players at final table: over 5.5 -120, under -120 Winner’s birthplace: US -200, Europe +300, Canada +650, Central/South America +1600, Australia +2000, Anywhere else +1600</p>
<p>Bovada has odds on whether the runner-up will lose because they got “rivered” on the final hand (Yes +300, No -500). Bettors can also put money on whether a female will reach the final table (Yes +550, No -1000).</p>
<p>Record Field?</p>
<p>Poker and the game’s most popular format Texas Hold’em underwent a bit of a cooling period in recent years in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>The number of Main Event entrants dwindled between 2010 through 2013. Attendance bounced back in 2014 when the WSOP guaranteed a top $10 million winning prize, which was claimed by Sweden’s Martin Jacobson.</p>
<p>But entries declined in 2015 when the Main Event decided to pay out a guaranteed 1,000 players, but a smaller amount to the overall winner. Just 6,420 entries were received that year.</p>
<p>The WSOP has again showed its resiliency, with Main Event entries increasing in each of the past three years. A total of 7,874 buy-ins of $10,000 each were received in 2018, with eventual winner John Cynn claiming the $8.8 million top prize.</p>
<p>The all-time largest WSOP Main event field came in 2006 when the championship generated 8,773 entries. As for next week, Bovada has the over/under at 7,850.5 entries.</p>
<p>Celebrity Showdowns</p>
<p>Numerous poker pros who are celebrities in their own rights are sitting down at World Series of Poker tables throughout the summer. The Main Event will of course entice them, too.</p>
<p>As for past Main Event champions, 2009 winner Joe Cada is the favorite to last the longest at +550. 2013 title winner Ryan Riess is next at +600. Cynn, Jacobson, Scott Blumstein (2017), and Joe McKeehen (2015) are at +700.</p>
<p>There are also head-to-head matchups between poker superstars. Daniel Negreanu is the favorite (-155) vs. Doug Polk (+115), and Phil Hellmuth (-155) against Phil Ivey (-105).</p>
<p>Finally, bettors can also take a gamble as to whether any former WSOP Main Event champ or any female will remain in the field longer. Past champions are favored at +130, to any female at -170.</p>
