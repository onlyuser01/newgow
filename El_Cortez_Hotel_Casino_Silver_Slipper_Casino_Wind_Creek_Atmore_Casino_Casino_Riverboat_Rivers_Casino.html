    <h1>El Cortez Hotel Casino Silver Slipper Casino Wind Creek Atmore Casino Casino Riverboat Rivers Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru team, first of all I think it's really nice that there is even the possibility to get support. Many thanks so far. Now to my extremely annoying and in my view criminal behavior of Viggoslots Casino.</p>
<p>On 04/28/2022 I claimed 2 welcome bonuses each. I lost both deposits completely. The welcome bonus is offered with no wagering requirements.</p>
<p>On 04/30/2022 I claimed the 3rd and last welcome bonus</p>
<p>After this 3rd deposit of €50 + €50 bonus, I made a withdrawal when the balance was €335 and canceled the bonus in the process. This question is asked during the withdrawal process if you are aware that the bonus would be forfeited upon withdrawal. I approve of this.</p>
<p>A short time later I canceled the payout and decided to continue playing. I was able to increase the profit again to €960. I played a Razor Shark slot which, according to Viggoslots, violated the bonus conditions. I had the bonus deleted here with the first payout. Well if that's the case I would find it really dubious but admit my mistake in the end.</p>
<p>But now comes what I consider to be a criminal act. I applied for the 960€ to be paid out. Later in the evening at 17:01 on 04/30/2022 I made a 4th deposit by credit card of €50. There was no bonus here either, since all 3 welcome bonuses were logically used up. With these €50, I then initiated two payouts of €300 and €530. These have now also been canceled as part of the first payout of €960. This is outrageous and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>As a side note, I also canceled the pending payout amount of €960 after the payout order for the legitimate winnings of €300 and €530 in order to continue playing here as well. From this I then split 2 payouts again 500 € and 700 €. This money was part of the "bonus violation" and therefore OK for me if canceled. However, as explained, I had the bonus deleted after the withdrawal order. I didn't play with bonus money here.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The €300 and €530 prizes were obtained legally and without injury.</p>
<p>If you insist on violating the payout amounts of €700 and €500, then I grudgingly agree.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I was only credited €50 due to the injury. But I made 2 deposits of €50 each on April 30th, 2022. So here, too, 50€ are being embezzled.</p>
<p>All processes can be tracked via the betting statistics and transactions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you in advance for your support and hope for a friendly agreement. Otherwise I will use all means against the casino.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Thomas</p>
