<p>Encouraged by the positive reception in other states, White Hat Studios expects its games to be a hit among players in Connecticut</p>
<p>White Hat Studios, a fast-growing provider of iGaming content, has further increased its presence in the US by launching in Connecticut. This will mark the first time its games have been available in the state.</p>
<p>GLI cleared more than 60 of White Hat’s games for launch in the state. With a Connecticut license secured, the company will be able to roll out some of its best slots in the state. This will include the launch of established hits such as Ted, The Goonies and Peaky Blinders, an upcoming release.</p>
<p>Players in the Constitution State will also get to experience White Hat’s Jackpot Royale mechanic, which increases engagement by offering three progressive jackpots for players within the state.</p>
<p>Finally, the provider will also roll out several of its best-performing online table games, providing something for fans of traditional casino experiences as well.</p>
<p>Connecticut will represent the fourth state where White Hat Studios’ content is available. The company forayed into the US market back in 2022 when it launched in Michigan, following this with launches in New Jersey and Pennsylvania earlier this year.</p>
<p>White Hat Expects Its Games to Be a Hit in the State</p>
<p>White Hat Studios’ chief executive officer, Andy Whitworth, released a statement regarding the launch in Connecticut. He said that his team is happy to continue its growth trajectory in the US and provide more operators with games from White Hat’s vast portfolio of games.</p>
<p>Whitworth said that the studio’s content has proven to be a resounding success in other states, attracting many players to its partnering operators’ platforms. The CEO said that he is sure White Hat’s titles will be just as popular in Connecticut as they are in Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We are the home to iGaming’s leading branded games, which are proven to attract new customers to an operator’s platform. We are confident that the launch into Connecticut will prove just as successful as our other state launches and are keen to see the reception they receive. Andy Whitworth, CEO, White Hat Studios</p>
