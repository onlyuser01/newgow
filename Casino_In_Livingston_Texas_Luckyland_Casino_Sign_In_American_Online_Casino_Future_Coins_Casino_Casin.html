    <h1>Casino In Livingston Texas Luckyland Casino Sign In American Online Casino Future Coins Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Let’s focus on what I said then Radka. Btw this is a forum and if you do not understand what a forum is you should not be replying to posters. I will write about Altacore NV casinos dirty laundry anytime I can because Guru is promoting this nasty group of casinos as trustworthy.</p>
<p>Im more concerned about what other players see here than your opinion "to be honest"</p>
<p>"Submit a complaint or inform our Data Team."</p>
<p>Im complaining on forum in leu of making a complaint because there is no point. I’m done with Altacore NV casinos and I want to make other players aware of their preditory Terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The complaint process is unproductive to say the least when you are looking to make Gurus reviews honest.</p>
<p>For example if I complain that payment is slow and not per terms and conditions the only thing that is followed up is eventual payment to the customer. Casino Guru does not change what the Daily limits are for payments on the review page when it is obvious across all Altacore NV casinos their policy is to stall payments as long as possible and make the max payout of 400€ per day regardless of each Individual casinos daily limits. The poor soles that win a large amount of money are in for a shock when they try to withdraw. Lol.</p>
<p>When it comes to the bonus structure there should be a warning at all Altacore NV casinos that if you do not withdraw your full balance at the time of bonus fulfillment you will have additional winnings deleted. There are many complaints in regards to this across Altacore NV casinos yet there are no warnings except on Dozenspins.</p>
<p>As for contacting the "data team" what would I send to them ? Guru has all the info they need in their complaint system but have made no wholesome changes to the Guru Review pages for the Altacore Casinos.</p>
<p>If I send in proof of delayed payments will the daily withdrawal limit change on review page?</p>
<p>If I send proof that that they claw back wins a second time after bonus fulfillment will you put a warning?</p>
<p>I call bullshit because there are active and resolved complaints regarding these issues and no changes have been made.</p>
