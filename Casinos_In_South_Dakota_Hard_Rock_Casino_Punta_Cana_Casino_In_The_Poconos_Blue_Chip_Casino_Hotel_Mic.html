<p>The leading iGaming marketing company loses a skilled non-executive director who was instrumental in many of its recent successes</p>
<p>Per Widerström’s decision to step down comes as he embarks on an exciting new chapter in his career, taking on the prestigious position of chief executive officer at renowned iGaming giant 888 Holdings. Widerström’s new appointment is a testament to his extensive expertise and exceptional track record within the iGaming sector. His time at Catena and deep understanding of the industry will help him excel at his new position.</p>
<p>Widerström Has a History of Success</p>
<p>During his tenure as a non-executive director at Catena Media, Widerström played a pivotal role in shaping the company’s strategies and guiding its growth trajectory. He joined the board in May 2019, lending the affiliate his extensive experience. Widerström previously held leadership positions at high-profile businesses like Gala Coral Group, bwin.party, and Expekt.com, providing him with unparalleled industry knowledge.</p>
<p>Widerström’s expertise significantly contributed to the Catena’s recent successes. The company recorded a significant financial upturn, announcing a $5.4 million share buyback program, and is enjoying stable growth. Catena board of directors chairman Göran Blomberg thanked Widerström for his hard work, lauding his strategic insights.</p>
<p>On behalf of all stakeholders, we express gratitude for his contributions and wish him every success in his new role. Göran Blomberg, Catena Media board of directors chairman</p>
<p>While Catena Media will certainly miss Widerström’s expertise, the company maintains significant momentum. The recent $6.56 million deal with Moneta gave the company the necessary capital to bolster its core markets and invest in strategic expansion. Catena’s planned 2024 North Carolina launch should provide a stable foothold for further North American expansion and ensure enduring success.</p>
<p>The New Position Offers Significant Challenges</p>
<p>As CEO of 888 Holdings, Widerström will utilize his industry insights to drive innovation, foster partnerships, and deliver outstanding results. The William Hill-owned brand’s newest global distribution alliance with Bragg Gaming Group will provide substantial opportunities for the new CEO to leverage his talents and contribute to 888’s growth in an increasingly competitive iGaming market.</p>
<p>One of Widerström’s first challenges in his new position will be to overcome the challenges associated with the UK Gambling Commission’s ongoing review. The regulator suspected connections to ongoing investigations into alleged bribery offenses involving Entain. The new CEO should help clear 888’s reputation, allowing the company to thrive in the challenging UK market.</p>
<p>Per Widerström’s departure from Catena Media and appointment as CEO of 888 Holdings mark a significant shift in the iGaming industry. His transition underscores the market’s dynamic nature and the continuous pursuit of top talent to lead and shape the future of gambling companies. As Widerström takes on his new role, the iGaming community awaits the innovative and transformative strategies he will bring to 888 Holdings.</p>
