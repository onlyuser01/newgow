<p>Markor Technology has received a license from Gibraltar’s regulatory commission. As a result, the company, which provides global solutions for the iGaming industry, will now be able to offer B2C bookmaker services on top of its existing product offering.</p>
<p>Markor Technology to Scale Offer with Gibraltar License</p>
<p>The license approval makes it possible for the company to recalibrate its strategy and expand its reach by giving itself a fresh boost in new product verticals. This development will further strengthen the company’s B2C presence and help reach new clients but also boost its offer to existing ones. The news was welcomed by Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield who said:</p>
<p>Markor Technology prides itself on being able to offer multi-licensed products and services to customers in regulated markets worldwide, and our newly acquired B2C bookmakers license adds yet another string to our bow. Markor Technology CEO Melissa Summerfield</p>
<p>The company itself is a reliable and trusted content provider to many established brands already, and it has a global workforce of more than 80 people. Markor Technology is also a fairly new company and it was founded only in 2020. It has been actively looking to scale its presence, with offices opening in Malta, South Africa, and India, apart from the Gibraltar operations.</p>
<p>Markor Technology has developed multi-licensed PAM systems which are highly customizable and can be adjusted to the specific expectations, needs and preferences of individual clients. This in turn makes it easy for partner operators to get the experience they know their players would appreciate.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Markor already offers an aggregation platform that features more than 5,000 games. Summerfield confirmed that the company is doubly determined to become a one-stop-shop for all operators in the iGaming industry, and this new license recognition was a step in the right direction. Markor is determined to service customers across a range of product verticals, she concluded.</p>
