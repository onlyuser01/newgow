    <h1>Hard Rock Casinos Casinos In Washington State With Hotels White Oak Casino Casino San Francisco Vict</h1>

<p>Online sports betting and gaming brand MaximBet continued with its effort to position itself at the intersection of lifestyle and gaming by entering into a partnership with Nicki Minaj.</p>
<p>‘Mega Superstar’ and ‘Brilliant Businesswoman’</p>
<p>The agreement between MaximBet and the most successful female rapper of all time Minaj will see them collaborate on merchandise, parties, fan experiences, and branding, bringing her artistry and influence to the world of sports betting while cementing MaximBet’s position at the nexus of lifestyle, sports and entertainment.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new partnership, MaximBet’s chief executive officer Daniel Graetzer outlined Minaj’s credentials not only as the “mega superstar” known to the world but as a “brilliant businesswoman.”</p>
<p>“Her role as a strategic advisor to MaximBet will be invaluable to us. She’s built one of the most powerful brands in the world, her own, and she’s applying that same savvy and creativity to our lifestyle sports betting brand.” Daniel Graetzer, CEO, MaximBet</p>
<p>Minaj’s impact on brands she collaborated with in the past was immediate, with just one lyric in a 2018 hit song reigniting Fendi’s popularity and increasing the demand for the brand’s logo print items. And she managed to achieve the same effect for the likes of Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Crocs, DSQUARED2, and Marc Jacobs by just wearing their item on social media, where she boasts 280 million followers and is the most-followed rapper.</p>
<p>‘Open the Doors for Others to Dream Big’</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, entrepreneur and media mogul and a lifelong sports fanatic Minaj expressed how proud she felt with the collaboration that will empower her to fully step into her “potential as a young, influential Queen and owner” and will also “open the doors for other to dream big.”</p>
<p>“Merging business savvy power moves with my natural, creative, sexy, fun, and fashion-forward expression is just so spot-on as it relates to this partnership.” Nicki Minaj</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration, Minaj will serve as Maxim magazine’s new creative director to influence editorial, photography, profiles, covers, and future events for the publisher with more than 25 million digital visitors per month and over nine million in global circulation across six continents and 75 countries.</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief of Maxim magazine Sardar Biglari used the occasion to express his thrill at the opportunity to partner with Minaj – “an extraordinary entrepreneur and leading artist of her generation” – a combination that will help Maxim transform in the right direction.</p>
<p>Minaj will also serve as a special advisor to the MaximBet Board of Directors and will actively participate in the brand’s efforts in the iGaming space.</p>
<p>The global partnership with Minaj is the latest collaboration for MaximBet with a popular figure from the world of entertainment and sports, following the agreement reached with Charlie Blackmon in April to name the Colorado Rockies player brand ambassador.</p>
