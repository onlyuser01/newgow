    <h1>Western Village Hotel Casino Sparks Nevada Ocean Casino In Atlantic City Casino Online Games For Rea</h1>

<p>Dear Gustavo,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://eur.pokerstarscasino.eu/tos/:</p>
<p>"A User may only have one Stars Account with The Stars Group and shall only use the Service using such single account. It is prohibited for a User to open multiple accounts with The Stars Group. In the event that The Stars Group becomes aware of additional accounts opened by a User, The Stars Group may close such additional accounts without notice and may confiscate funds held in such accounts."</p>
<p>"CONCURRENT LOGINS. The Stars Group strictly prohibits a User to be logged in to more than one account within the same player pool (i.e. at the same poker table or in the same tournament) at the same time, whether any play activity occurs on any such account or not. The Stars Group shall have the right to terminate a User's account and may confiscate funds held in such account if a User engages or attempts to engage in any such activity, regardless of the outcome of such attempt."</p>
<p>Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if you have ever participated in the same tournament, together with your wife? Have you been using separate accounts with separate depositing payment methods? If there’s any relevant communication between you and the casino, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
