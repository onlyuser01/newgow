    <h1>Dania Beach Casino Choctaw Casino Valley View Casino Hotel Online Gambling Casinos The Artesian Hote</h1>

<p>In principle, the bonus is used to give the player the impression that something is good for him.</p>
<p>The truth is however - the bonus is only there to make the one possible withdrawal as difficult as possible.</p>
<p>You pay 50 euros and get 100% bonus play with 100 euros.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>Now comes the hammer that falls on your head.</p>
<p>Problem number 1</p>
<p>now you have to wager the deposit and the bonus 30 times, for example, that means at</p>
<p>50 + 50 * 30 = 3000 euros</p>
<p>that you have to implement.</p>
<p>Problem number 2</p>
<p>Lots of games and that are not a few at some casinos - they are not allowed to be played.</p>
<p>In reputable casinos these players do not even rise - you will also be informed that this game with a bonus is not playable.</p>
<p>But now you are in a casino where you are not informed of this - then if you want to play a certain game you have to check whether this game is allowed to be played.</p>
<p>Now you play a game anyway. And only wager a few euros-whether you win or not, the casino takes the chance to deny you the withdrawal. If you are lucky, but only in the rarest cases, they will give you that money. But the chances are actually zero.</p>
<p>Then if you are lucky, and you have managed to implement everything, also not played the wrong games, and have, for example, 5000 euros on the account, then some casinos still have the point in the conditions</p>
<p>maximum payout for bonus is then 5 times the bonus amount - juhu 250 euros instead of 5000.</p>
<p>Which actually again, if you take it exactly, is actually forbidden.</p>
<p>These unilateral contracts should actually not turn out to be used by only one party. In the case of the casino.</p>
<p>Why do I mean that?</p>
<p>Casino requires you to wager your deposit and bonus, but only grant you a payout of 5 times the bonus.</p>
<p>The same rules should apply here as when making a deposit!</p>
<p>When I deposit:</p>
<p>Deposit + bonus * 30</p>
<p>When I cash out</p>
<p>Deposit + bonus * 30</p>
<p>Then at least I'll be lucky if I really win something for the same amount as I had to implement.</p>
<p>You see bonus fingers away!</p>
<p>I would like to mention one casino where you can possibly talk about bonuses</p>
<p>INTERCASINO</p>
<p>15 times the implementation has to be fulfilled here. And you have the option of withdrawing your winnings at any time, regardless of what you have implemented. the only thing that is taken away is the bonus amount.</p>
<p>I hope the casino guru team can check this at Intercasino and confirm that I am writing something wrong here</p>
