<p>BetConstruct said that the Danish license is a sublime advantage that will help the company establish a presence in a less saturated market</p>
<p>BetConstruct, a leading provider of iGaming and online sports betting solutions, announced that it has successfully earned a license from the Danish Gambling Authority. As a result, the supplier will be able to enter Denmark and offer its products to local operators.</p>
<p>Denmark, BetConstruct remarked, is known as one of the “most reputable and strictly regulated” gambling markets in the world. The local market is under the watch of the Danish Gambling Authority, which has been very proactive in fighting unlicensed gambling.</p>
<p>Having secured a license in the Nordic country, BetConstruct will be able to make a foray into a flourishing and well-regulated iGaming market that offers tons of new opportunities. The provider said that most of its products and services have been greenlit for launch, which will greatly expand its overall reach in Europe.</p>
<p>The License Is a “Sublime Advantage“</p>
<p>BetConstruct noted that gambling and sports betting operators in Denmark will now be able to benefit from its cutting-edge solutions, which include iGaming titles, sports betting offerings, live casino games and various solutions for retail betting locations.</p>
<p>The new license allows BetConstruct to work together with other operators, content suppliers, marketing affiliates and payment providers that have been granted a license by the Danish Gambling Authority.</p>
<p>BetConstruct concluded that it is honored to be one of the first providers to secure a Danish Online Casino and Betting license and noted that this will provide it with a major advantage over its European competitors.</p>
<p>Obtaining a license from The Danish Gambling Authority is a sublime advantage for businesses to widen their game offerings, enter a new, less saturated market in Europe and provide safe and engaging services to players. Hence, BetConstruct is proud to become one of the first providers to receive this prestigious license. BetConstruct statement</p>
<p>The Provider Continues to Expand Its Presence and Product Suite</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BetConstruct also secured a license from the Malta Gaming Authority, which allowed its Vivaro Limited brand to accept wagers and deposits in cryptocurrencies. The major development allowed BetConstruct to further its foray into the crypto space and promote blockchain solutions in iGaming.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the provider also signed a new round-the-clock partnership with Sports Information Services, a major racing company. Under the deal, SIS agreed to supply BetConstruct with live content from the world of racing. As a result, BetConstruct was able to enhance its offering with content from 35,000 horse races and 38,000 greyhound events.</p>
