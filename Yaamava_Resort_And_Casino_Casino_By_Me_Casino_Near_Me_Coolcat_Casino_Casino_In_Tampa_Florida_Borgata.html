<p>Borgata Online Casino is easily one of the true heavyweights in the US iGaming industry. With a glitzy look and impeccable functionality, Borgata brings you one of the heftiest portfolios of games you will find anywhere in the United States and definitely in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Borgata has plenty to offer players who enjoy live online casinos and would not mind having a shot at some of the latest games developed by dozens of dedicated software suppliers. To make things even better, the Borgata Casino has a dedicated welcome bonus to offer.</p>
<p>That and more awaits in what is arguably one of the best online casinos in the US, bringing you dedicated customer support, a spectacular variety of over 1000+ games, and not least, a casino app that will make playing on the go a lot of fun. Find out this and more in our dedicated Borgata Online Casino review.</p>
<p>Where Is Borgata Online Casino Available?</p>
<p>Borgata Online Casino is presently available in two states, to name Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The company uses the same core platform but has a slightly different approach towards each market, giving it a unique twist.</p>
<p>We will surely see Borgata operate its online casino in other states before long, but for the time being, the Keystone and Garden State take precedence as some of the busiest iGaming options.</p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>Borgata Online Casino’s New Jersey skin is clearly one of the best in the entire industry. It’s also the first online casino attempt by Borgata and a highly successful one. As you can imagine, the website has plenty to offer, bringing you an amazing variety of gaming options.</p>
<p>Borgata features numerous bonus rewards, a customized user interface, and a great mobile experience. You can find the product that you want the most, all courtesy of the casino’s intuitive User Interface (UI), and enjoy a frictionless experience. Live since 2013, Borgata Online Casino NJ defines the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Pennsylvania welcomed Borgata Online Casino in February 2021 as part of a broader partnership with Rivers Caesars Philadelphia. It marked the second market where Borgata had decided to expand into, and with the Keystone State being one of the most populous gambling markets, it was a good decision too.</p>
<p>Much of the original NJ skin has been preserved here, albeit with a few minor differences to add authenticity. Borgata Online Casino PA works on its own dedicated promotions and chooses to feature its game differently to better cater to the local audience.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus &amp; Promos</p>
<p>The best way to start your gaming session at Borgata Online Casino is with a bang, and to this end, the casino has a lot to offer. The casino welcomes you to a $20 no deposit bonus and an added cash bonus that is worth 100% of your first deposit up to $1,000.</p>
<p>The $20 no deposit bonus is easy to play through as it comes with a simple 1x wagering requirement. For the $1,000, you will need to wager $10 per bonus dollar to release the funds.</p>
<p>You will clearly benefit from playing slots as they guarantee the quickest rollover and contribute the maximum amount towards the bonus fulfillment requirements. There are many slots you can try, too, with classic, video, and other variations of the popular games and well over 800 options to pick from!</p>
<p>New Jersey is a state that has many bonuses to offer, but Borgata Casino really goes out of this way to have you covered. Both the $20 no deposit and $1,000 deposit bonus are sizable promotional chunks that will help you enjoy great times in the Garden State if you focus on iGaming. Borgata Online is seeking to expand beyond its home bastion, giving it new ideas to improve the bonus experience closer to home in NJ.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus in New Jersey follows the exact same logic as the one offered in Pennsylvania. It’s possible for bonuses in different states to be slightly different as each digital skin of the Borgata Online Casino operates independently from the rest and strives to achieve the highest market share in its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In other words, you may discover a brand new experience in Pennsylvania or New Jersey when visiting while still enjoying the Borgata Casino brand and its proven track record for customer care and gaming excellence.</p>
<p>Is There a Borgata Online Casino Promo Code?</p>
<p>Bonuses seem to always have a great pull over players, and that is fantastic. The one thing everyone seems to be looking for, though, are promo codes. Well, Borgata promo codes aren’t as frequent as you would expect them to be simply because the casino doesn’t ask you to use one to claim the bags of goodies that come in the form of promos.</p>
<p>Instead, you can navigate to the relevant section and choose the promotion that brings you the most joy, and claim that with a simple deposit. All you need to do is follow a few easy steps and keep an eye out for the wagering requirements. If there is a promo code, after all, Borgata Casino will let you know promptly.</p>
<p>Other Casino Promotions</p>
<p>Apart from the welcome bonus, Borgata Casino Online is home to numerous promos that will bring you joy every step of the way. The casino makes sure to list every available promo and often changes those so that you can have a better variety. Apart from the $1,000 in welcome funds, you can easily claim $5 in bonus money as soon as you are done betting your first $50 on slots.</p>
<p>A similar quality-of-life bonus is the $10 Treasures Bet &amp; Get a promotion. Granted, these bonuses aren’t game-changers, and they may seem a little small to begin with. However, they are small and handy solutions that add something to your overall gameplay experience, too.</p>
<p>Welcome to M Life Rewards</p>
<p>Every great casino has loyalty programs, but Borgata Online Casino has something better – the M Life Rewards by BetMGM. This program allows players to enjoy excellent gaming conditions that will help them to benefit fully from a garden variety of promotions that are often only awarded exclusively through the program.</p>
<p>To make things even better, M Life Rewards will serve as a gateway to both physical and digital perks that are bestowed on you at your discretion. The multi-tier loyalty program will allow you to access different benefits.</p>
<p>The only level you cannot break into is NOIR, which is invitation only, but if you turn out to be a huge iGaming fan, Borgata Online Casino will definitely spot you and offer you a quick way to the very top of the loyalty program.</p>
<p>Games and Software</p>
<p>Borgata has no shortage of excellent games to make you feel right at home at the casino. Players will have a vast array of titles, choosing from over 1,000 games that make every step of the way fun and exciting.</p>
<p>You will get your garden variety slots, but also some exclusive and progressive jackpot titles that will guarantee a lot of fun. Popular developers here include IGT, NetEnt, WMS, and Konami.</p>
<p>The betting limits are very flexible, and you will have a tantalizing selection of genres to explore. Some may be familiar while others will be unique Borgata Online Casino concoctions, including:</p>

<p>New Games</p>

<p>Variety Games</p>
<p>Virtue Sports</p>
<p>Borgata Bucks</p>
<p>Each section is tailored to match the taste of the players who have come looking there looking for each specific genre of games. Whether you are going after slots, variety games, or Borgata’s unique “Bucks,” you will soon figure out that this casino operator has it all.</p>
<p>Borgata Casino is packing a lot of gaming action, and you will have your pick of the litter as soon as you arrive. The categories are easy to navigate, and they give you a great breakdown of everything that is on offer. Let’s take a closer look at the available Borgata Online Casino games.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are the bread and butter of many casinos, and Borgata Online is really no exception. The website is stacked with excellent versions in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and you can have your pick without ever worrying you are missing out on something!</p>
<p>The titles you will find here are brought to you by the expert hands of IGT, NetEnt, Konami, and WMS. You will be able to track the fixed jackpots applied to various popular slots, such as Starburst, in real-time and get a shot at slots such as Cleopatra, Bonanza Megaways, Jumanji, and Gonzo’s Quest, to name a few.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of cool themes to enjoy, including Book of Dead for all the adventurers out there and Day of the Dead for all of those who are keen on Mexican culture and don’t mind a proper slot celebration.</p>
<p>Borgata Online Casino makes the choice of the right slot for you a piece of cake, and you will get your hands on delights such as Guns N’ Roses, 9 Masks of Fire, and even Gordon Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen. You can find slots that come with numerous features, including bonus games, multipliers, free spins, fixed jackpots, megaways payouts, and more.</p>

<p>Table Games</p>

<p>There are lots of options to explore, with the game giving you a decent overall payout percentage exceeding 99%. The rules of the game are pretty much standard, and there are a few slight changes in some of the versions. The exclusive Borgata game, though, plays exactly to the classic version’s rules.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>

<p>Customer Service</p>
<p>The Borgata Online Casino customer service support is spot-on, and you will have a very easy time liaising with the care agents who are there to assist you with any questions you may have. First of all, each version of the casino has a dedicated Help &amp; Contact section, which starts with a quick questionnaire.</p>
<p>The questionnaire is designed to potentially lead you to the answers you need without having to deal with another person. If this doesn’t help, Borgata Casino is happy to assist you via email or via live chat, which is a feature available 24/7.</p>
<p>While there is no phone number for Borgata’s online platform, you can still fall back on the two solutions described above, and rest assured that they will be a reliable way to get in touch and troubleshoot any potential issue you might have.</p>
<p>Borgata Casino App</p>
<p>One of the best ways to experience any casino is on the go. Borgata Casino makes sure that you have an easy way of doing just that. The dedicated Borgata Casino app is available for both Android and iOS, allowing you to quickly download light and powerful pieces of software.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Borgata app will allow you to navigate the casino just like you would from a desktop device with direct access to every iGaming feature. You can opt out of the apps as well and just use your mobile browser if you think this is a quicker way to achieve the exact same effect.</p>
<p>We enjoy the apps because they can be downloaded very quickly from anywhere, and they offer a slightly more dedicated experience which is another big plus in our book. Players may find the use of an app much easier as it allows them to quickly navigate through the website, and the UI itself is fixated so that you can have smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>Most players today choose to stick to mobile casino gaming, and we are fairly certain that you will be happy with the same option yourself.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Borgata Online Casino has plenty to offer, and it’s definitely one of the leading iGaming websites in the USA. Many competitor casinos would not care to spend as much effort into their offers, but Borgata goes the extra mile in a bid to bring you the best possible gaming experience, plain and simple. You get to enjoy numerous games, reliable 24/7 customer support, and a superb mobile platform.</p>
