<p>Global betting and gaming group Entain announced today a research initiative into consumer practices, preferences, and behaviors in Ontario, Canada, will be funded via the Entain Foundation.</p>
<p>RGC Tasked with the Research</p>
<p>The research into consumer behavior in the Canadian province will be conducted by the Toronto-based nonprofit Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) as regulators in the province prepare to introduce legal sports betting and gaming.</p>
<p>“We know from similar research in many markets in which we operate, including the United States, that regulators value research which supports an evidence-based approach to decision-making and effective regulation from a wide range of other international jurisdictions.” Martin Lycka, SVP, American Regulatory Affairs &amp; Responsible Gambling, Entain</p>
<p>Leader in advice on responsible gambling practices RGC will look to provide insights on consumer behavior to facilitate evidence-based recommendations by regulators to help federal authorities evaluate properly all aspects of the bill seeking to introduce single-event sports betting legalization.</p>
<p>The bill introduced in December last year is looking to establish a license-based regulatory framework for online operators in the province and Entain has already expressed its interest to apply for a license in Ontario when it is available.</p>
<p>“Entain, which operates across five continents and over 20 countries, has unparalleled experience with different regulatory approaches taken around the world in the past 15 years.” Martin Lycka, SVP, American Regulatory Affairs &amp; Responsible Gambling, Entain</p>
<p>Insights into Consumer Behavior</p>
<p>Led by RGC’s global consultation service RG Plus, the research will also consider experiences and practices in other jurisdictions worldwide to ensure online operators take into account patterns of problem behavior as well as risk factors leading to such issues with the end goal of providing protection for people potentially at risk.</p>
<p>“As a global leader in responsible gambling, RGC is committed to working with regulators, operators and the public to establish the development and implementation of a robust responsible gambling culture. RGC’s work with Entain will contribute to vital advancements in consumer safeguards.” Shelley White, CEO, RGC</p>
<p>Approximately 4,000 adults with affinity to betting and gaming will form the sample for the research, looking to draw player behavior insights and provide the most comprehensive evidence related to responsible online gaming and betting.</p>
<p>As part of the research which is expected to commence immediately and file its full report later in the year, informant interviews from other key international jurisdictions will be evaluated to provide alternative approaches to regulation with regards to effective responsible gaming practices.</p>
<p>The funding provided by the Entain Foundation further extends Entain’s commitment to responsible gambling and implementation of consumer behavioral data, following on last month’s new player protection initiative ARC to allow for quick identification and safeguarding of players at early stages of developing gambling addiction.</p>
