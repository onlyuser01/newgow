    <h1>Lytton Casino Hollywood Casino App Osage Casino Tulsa Ok Danbury Wi Casino Konami Slots Casino Yoju</h1>

<p>I play at three other dama n.v casinos to which i am considered a valuable player and have had nothing but a valuable experience at those casinos. Like i said casino guru you can either choose to help and dobthe right thing when someone genuinely has been robbed or you can pretend to and really do nothing at all. I cant force anyone to do anything, however if you say you are mediators and cant see what is going on here then i dont know what else to do and i give up.</p>
<p>Its now going onto 46 days, if yoju had made the payment it would have landed in my bank by now, they havent and it has not. If it had why after 46 days would i be here stating i havent received the money? Im not a liar nor am i into scamming businesses out of money. I am however a person who beleives in integrity and honesty and when i say yoju are criminals and ahould have their licence suspended its because they are just that.</p>
<p>I also understand the service casino guru offer and that they are not able to force anyone to pay money, however i also know that casino guru do get paid by online casinos to generate revenue for online casinos and at the end of the day casino guru and yoju do share this agreement and because of that alone some may question what the bigger picture really is here.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, i am well aware as to how gambling works, ive been playing online for well over 15 years and not once in this time have i ever put any incorrect information when it comes to payments incoming or outbound. Yoju casino can say what they want regarding what they have or havent done. The simple truth of the matter is they have not paid me into my bank account the 2600 dollars i requested fo withdraw. Furthermore i dont have a problem with gambling in any shape way or form, but the money i deposited and the money i have not received has left me in a predicament and just before christmas. Something that i have had nothing to do with here this is all on yoju casino stuffing up on their end. Why i would be made to feel as if ive done something wrong here is beyond me and i dont appreciate being madw to feel as such. If they dont want to honour my withdrawal, fine, but why is it they are not willing to refund my deposits for the last 60 days then so that i can move on with my life and not have to think about how ive been robbed every day. They dont want to pay my withdrawal they dont want to refund my money they are criminals end of story.</p>
