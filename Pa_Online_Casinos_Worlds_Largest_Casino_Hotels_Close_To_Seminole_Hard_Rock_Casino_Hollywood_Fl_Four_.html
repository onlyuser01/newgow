<p>Washington’s D.C. Lottery gambling app powered by Intralot saw a 27.8% increase in handle month-over-month but still lags behind William Hill’s temporary sportsbook.</p>
<p>D.C. Lottery’s Gambet Sees Increase in Revenue</p>
<p>It has been a great month for Washington’s D.C. Lottery with total handle growing by 27.8% month-over-month in October and mobile betting paying off. Yet, the lottery is facing a challenge as it vies with William Hill’s sterling mobile betting platform, which has still generated the bulk of all mobile bets out of the Capital One Arena where the brick-and-mortar sportsbook is located.</p>
<p>All in all, the D.C. Lottery posted $4.2 million in total handle generated through the gambling app developed by Intralot, and winnings for consumers amounting to $3.4 million. According to the Lottery’s data, Gambet, as the app is called, has generated over $822,000 in gambling revenue in October, posting a good overall performance so far. The app launched in May, and has so far driven overall revenue close to $10.6 million.</p>
<p>William Hill Continues to Dominate Mobile Market</p>
<p>Even though William Hill has been met with some solid restrictions introduced by the regulator, consumers have repeatedly turned to the company’s mobile betting product, generating the bulk of mobile betting handle in D.C. through William Hill’s solution.</p>
<p>The company saw a 17.8% jump in betting handle in October, with the total stakes hitting $14.4 million. An estimated $11.6 million was paid back to consumers and the revenue of $2.7 million constituted a solid 108% increase for William Hill month-over-month.</p>
<p>William Hill has collected a total of $35.7 million and generating $5.5 million in revenue. In the meantime, William Hill is in the process of transferring US and international assets to different companies.</p>
<p>While there has been speculation about the non-US assets, the United States’ operations will be transferred to Caesars. William Hill is also preparing to open up its permanent sportsbook at the Capital One Arena early in 2021, offering 1,500 square feet of LED screens, 12 ticket windows and 10 self-service kiosks, and dedicated VIP areas.</p>
<p>Commenting on the upcoming sportsbook, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment President of Business Operations Jim Van Stone had this to add: “The William Hill Sports Book will be a one-of-a-kind, immersive experience, not only for Wizards and Capitals fans attending events, but for all sports fans.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, William Hill took a slight tumble in Q3 results, but the online and international segments were up nevertheless.</p>
