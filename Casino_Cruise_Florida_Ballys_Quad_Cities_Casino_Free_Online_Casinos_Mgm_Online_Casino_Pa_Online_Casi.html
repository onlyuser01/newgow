    <h1>Casino Cruise Florida Ballys Quad Cities Casino Free Online Casinos Mgm Online Casino Pa Online Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Askgamblers.com,</p>
<p>sorry about my english, i translate words with google translate.</p>
<p>On the 22th february 2020 i made a registration on vulkanvegas casino. I deposited first 50 Euro with a 100% bonus, i lost it. After this lose i deposited again 300 Euro with a 200% bonus, my balance was on 900 Euro with bonus. I begann to playing, i made about 600 Euro win on Legacy of Egypt. After this win my balance was about on 1500 Euro, i think the bonus was non-sticky, i knew it canceled the bonus. After this i had 900 Euro raw cash, i played with a lot of slots on 22th and 23th february 2020. In the afternoon/evening of the 23th february i lost this balance. I made again a 300 Euro deposit with bonus, i think it was a 100% bonus. I started to playing slots, i played also with Extra Chili slot and as it turned out afterwards i made a mistake, becouse i buy bonuses on 0.3 and 0.4 Euro, (i can attach this gameround). I played next with other slots, on the end i had 220 Euro withdrawble balance (i think i vouchsafe the bonus terms). I withdrawed the 220 Euro on the evening 23th february 2020 to my bank account.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th february i wondered that the 220 Euro was credited on my bank account, without an ID, Bank Card, Adress and GAME HISTORY check! I played on a lot casinos, and only ID, Bank Card, Adress and GAME HISTORY check they didn't withdraw anything. After this i thought its all okay and on the 24th february i withdrawed 200 Euro and 300 Euro without bonus and started playing slots i played with this cash till 26th february when my balance was on 1000 Euro. I decided i cashout this money. The casino send me this email:</p>

<p>I send the documents on the same day 26th february 2020 to the casino. It elapsed 2 days, nothing happens. On the 28th february i decided write to the casino chat. I asked about the vervying KYC check. The answered a must again upload my ID with my face, i sent it. I think after 2 hours i also asked about the KYC check.</p>
<p>After this comes the surprise.</p>
<p>They blocked my account becouse i violated the bonus rules on the 23th february. My problem is why my account was not closed before the â‚¬ 220 payment after the violation? This withdraw was without ID, Bank Card, Adress and Balance/Account check. In the casinos e-mail is: "To use all the features of your account, including the withdrawals of your winnings, it is necessary to pass through a standard procedure of the KYC-check. (why they withdrawed me without KYC check and balance check?)" My other problem is also that i deposited after the violate the 200 and 300 Euro, had after playing slots an 1000 Euro balance and now i lost it all... When the casino sad me earlier before the 220 withdraw, Hey man you made a violate, then i agree this, and i didn't deposit more (if I had paid more 1000 euros then I would have lost it all? - i think that is not fair)!</p>
<p>As I read, there was more similar case at this casino:</p>
