<p>The NOVOMATIC Digital Gaming and Entertainment division has reported a new important milestone by securing a license for its StarGames.de website in Germany</p>
<p>Greentube has received an official go-ahead by the Gambling Authority of the Federal States of Germany (GGL) which makes the StarGames.de a licensed entity that can deliver on a range of experiences.</p>
<p>StarGames will benefit from Greentube’s existing infrastructure and solutions that will allow it to remain at the forefront of the regulated market in Germany. These include but aren’t limited to IT security and game mechanics, Responsible Gaming, and anti-money laundering solutions that are aligned with GGL’s licensing standards.</p>
<p>Important Milestone for Greentube in Germany</p>
<p>Greentube COO Georg Gubo was pleased with this new opportunity and said that it was a further testament to how far the company and its brands have come. Both StarGames and Greentube are capable to deliver outstanding content and experiences that are aligned with the needs of the current market.</p>
<p>Gubo reaffirmed that his company’s mission, as always, remained the creation of content and products of the highest quality and value to the end-customer and businesses, while also using the necessary safeguards to ensure that customers are out of harm’s way.</p>
<p>Through the arrival of StarGames.de on the nationwide regulated market, Greentube feels that it has a website that goes well above the market standards for safety and entertainment in Germany. Greentube is also happy to further expand its reach in the country.</p>
<p>StarGames brand manager Laszlo Pados was similarly pleased with the development, arguing that the German license was further proof of the hard work Greentube has been putting in to make sure that it continues to expand its brands and product offerings in new markets.</p>
<p>Looking Beyond the German iGaming Market</p>
<p>“We cannot wait to get started on this exciting next chapter,” Pados added. In the meantime, Greentube has maintained a steadfast global momentum. The company obtained a license to be recognized as an official Online Gaming Service Provider in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Greentube similarly introduced its Greentube Mynt solution, an advanced technology stack to help with the production and supply of casino content and online games. Not least, the company has expanded in the Latin American market with LatamWin, a prominent brand and local operator with a strong pull across the region.</p>
<p>Greentube’s acquisition of a German license for StarGames is just a start for the company’s broader ambitions to expand in regulated and emerging markets across the globe this year.</p>
