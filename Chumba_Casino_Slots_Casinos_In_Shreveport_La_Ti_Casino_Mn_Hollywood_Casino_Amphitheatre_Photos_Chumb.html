<p>According to Spicy Spins Terms and Conditions a "Total bets" is defined as the sum of individual bets (lines, chips, hands, etc.) within a round, i.e., the total bet amount when clicking the "spin" or "play" or equivalent button.</p>
<p>I placed a bet on the 01/05/2020 01:54:59 at Blackjack Lobby 5eab812bb841440e9890ad15 which was a €20 hand. I selected double cause the dealer had a low hand and won €80. Please note that i clicked double after</p>
<p>the "spin" or "play" or equivalent button.</p>
<p>Spicy Spice has cancelled my withdrawal and removed all my winnings stating it because of "Irregular play": Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play.</p>
<p>"Thank you for playing at Spicy Spins Casino</p>
<p>We have received your payment of GBP 100 and your balance has been credited with€ 112.51 Reference number: 589092."</p>
<p>30% of €112.51 = €33.753.</p>
<p>I have tried to explain to them that according to their T&amp;C and definition of "Total Bets", that my blackjack hand is valid and not in breach of any "irregular play". They refuse to acknowledge this and try to claim that my other bets of €31 and €32 also violated they "irregular play" rule. After pointing out that 30% of €112.51 is €33.753 they respond with "you placed a €40 bet which is 30% greater than the deposit" and closing the chat. Most cases they don't respond at all.</p>
<p>They have refused verify or provide a detailed breakdown of this blackjack hand which will prove that I played according to their T&amp;C.</p>
