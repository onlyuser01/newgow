    <h1>Facebook Doubledown Casino Soaring Eagle Casino Hotel Windcreek Casino Atmore Casino Davenport Iowa</h1>

<p>The account is fully verified through the DIA application.</p>
<p>The first deposit was 2000 UAH with a bonus. Funds are completely lost. Then I made deposits of 1-2k and the game was only for real money (no bonuses) in one slot from EGT. This is Great 27. This is a good provider that clearly does not need to check gaming sessions. I also want to note that there was no big win. I am a taco player who makes a deposit, bets on the withdrawal (if there was a win), then continue to make deposits and play.</p>
<p>The last communication was at 7 am. I don’t see the point in re-applying, tk. the operator's answers will not be original.</p>
<p>It's just that the situation is uncomfortable for me. If they cannot withdraw $800, then why should I continue to play with them and deposit large sums?</p>
<p>I also draw your attention to the fact that they reported that the winnings were being verified, and then they canceled the withdrawal twice. Please clarify why this is done if the output is checked?</p>
<p>Of course, they will bring it out sooner or later. I just don’t see the point in playing at a casino where the withdrawal is once a week. I am a more active player in this regard.</p>
