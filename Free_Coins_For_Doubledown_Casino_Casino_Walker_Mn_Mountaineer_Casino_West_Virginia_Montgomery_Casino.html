    <h1>Free Coins For Doubledown Casino Casino Walker Mn Mountaineer Casino West Virginia Montgomery Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a complaint regarding issues with bonus. I recently got account in Cbet.gg</p>
<p>At the beginning of January because they have a good selection with Sports bets.</p>
<p>My first deposit was in value of 500 Euros in 1 January. I tried to deposit 250 it didn’t went true so i tried again i transferred suddenly 500 Euros. But that’s not the problem. I start betting on fotball and csgo matches everyday and managed to raise up my balance to 2429,36 euro. I could not place bet the amount I would sometimes 100 euros, i will get limits max win( I have screenshots of that). I’m a person who never accept bonuses offers the reason is that restrictions of not withdrawing and i would not take the chance since i do not know the Cbet.gg that well. I did not accept or been given bonus offer.</p>
<p>I have 2429,36 Euros in my account on Cbet.gg</p>
<p>I tried to withdraw to my bank account and to my surprise i had 200 bonus attached to my winnings I did not know about. It’s a sport &amp; esport welcome bonus. I will send screenshot of that bonus which is ridiculous. I contacted customer service on live chat and told me I have activated 200 Euros date 7.1.21</p>
<p>which I did not. I checked my activities did not found that I did activated bonus that date of my betting history. I found out that my whole balance was on bonus and can’t withdraw nothing all. I will upload transaction history here so it validates my words. My winning should be available for withdrawl.</p>
<p>I have contacted them on mail to solve this, they have not responded to any emails. I have only reached them on live chat support, they never answered me on why all my winnings is on bonus. I’m not the only who experience this before in cbet.gg</p>
<p>I would like make withdraw and move on. Hopefully we can solve this. Please contact me if you need further informations.</p>
