<p>An elderly man is dead after what should have been an average day at a Baltimore, MD, casino. Clarence Buckner reportedly had a good night at the slot machines, making him a target for criminals. He was followed home, where he was attacked and murdered in cold blood. The assailant is still being sought by police.</p>
<p>Casino Visit Ends in the Worst Way</p>
<p>Elizabeth Buckner stated that her husband had just won big at Horseshoe Casino and they were planning to have dinner at home on Sunday, according to the Baltimore Sun. Clarence was sitting at the table when his wife went out to check her mail. She said that an armed man took her by the hand and led her back to her home. He demanded money from her husband.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Buckner, in an interview on Tuesday, recalled that “he grabbed me and said, ‘you got 20 seconds.'”</p>
<p>She added that the gunman told her, “I followed him from the casino. I know that he had the money.”</p>
<p>Buckner claimed that her 66-year-old husband gave the gunman only what he had, but demanded more. She claimed that her husband was able to distract the gunman, and she was able to escape and run to a neighbor.</p>
<p>She said that she heard a gunshot as soon as she arrived at the house. Buckner claimed that her neighbor called 911 and urged Buckner to stay. She said, “I told him I had to go back and make certain he’s okay.”</p>
<p>Buckner returned to the house to find her husband lying on the living room floor.</p>
<p>Clarence was a retired Baltimore City Public Schools employee, where he was a cook in the cafeterias. He most recently worked at City Springs Elementary School in East Baltimore.</p>
<p>Pressure on the City to Act</p>
<p>Monday’s homicide was addressed by Mayor Brandon Scott. We will not stop, and I know the men and women of the Baltimore police department continue to work hard every day with that one focus and that’s to bring people to justice, get (killers) off the street,” Scott said.</p>
<p>Some say city council members need to put more focus on crime. Buckner’s case is just one of a few that have occurred recently. This includes a woman who was shot and killed last week during a Door-Dash food delivery in northeast Baltimore.</p>
<p>A Little Italy restaurant manager was then shot and killed as he walked out of a Fells Point corner store. His murder was captured on surveillance video.</p>
<p>The husband of a Baltimore Police lieutenant was shot and killed while he waited outside a Northeast Baltimore home.</p>
<p>So far, in just 34 days of the new year, 36 people have been killed in Baltimore.</p>
