<p>Information about Klarna casinos</p>
<p>Klarna is a leading Fintech platform that allows consumers to make direct online payments to merchants, as well as a pay-after-delivery plan that can be paid in instalments.</p>
<p>It's also a smooth option for making deposits in online casinos, and several online casinos on the Casino Guru database accept Klarna payments. Read on to find more about Klarna as a company, their pros and cons, and how to find the best Klarna online casino for you.</p>

<p>About Klarna: a European fintech giant with humble beginnings</p>
<p>Good things often come from failure: after all, it's the best way to learn. In the case of Klarna, their three founders suffered a setback in 2005 when they fared badly in a Swedish university entrepreneurship program with their simple online payment system idea.</p>
<p>Undeterred, they formed Klarna that summer with the help of an angel investor, who put them in touch with a group of programmers to help them build it.</p>
<p>Their progress was steady until 2007, when they attracted investment from a venture capital firm and Klarna expanded into the rest of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>2010 saw them grow further, starting operations in Germany and the Netherlands. The investment of famous U.S. firm Sequoia Capital helped them push their revenues to over $54 million in 2011, and British newspaper The Telegraph included them in their 'Europe's 100 most promising young tech companies' list.</p>
<p>Since then, they have gone from strength to strength, attracting hundreds of millions in investment, acquiring multiple companies in Klarna Group, and being dubbed one of Sweden's five 'unicorns' — along with the likes of Spotify and Skype — by a Swedish minister. They're now one of Europe's largest financial institutions, processing over a million transactions a day for millions of end customers.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Klarna</p>
<p>Klarna's standout feature has to be their pay-after-delivery option that allows consumers to pay for goods on credit up to 60 days after purchase. The payment is spread over three instalments, the first of which is taken automatically once the seller has dispatched the item, with zero interest charged. Most users will find this an attractive option, but especially those with a tight budget who will see it as a better alternative to high-interest credit cards.</p>
<p>There are also a series of financing plans that offer longer repayment periods of between six and 36 months, albeit with a fixed interest charge.</p>
<p>Note: If you do select either of the above options, it's important to be aware of potential charges should you miss a payment or require more instalments. Klarna are fairly flexible on this, though, giving an extra 14 days to pay, and, even then, they insist that they won't file for a negative score on your credit file.</p>
<p>One thing to bear in mind is that these financing features are not available in online casinos, but this should be seen as a positive in terms of safe gambling, as betting with borrowed money is not advisable.</p>
<p>Klarna is also a smooth operator when it comes to creating an account. The registration process is very simple: just a few clicks on their website, some standard personal details, and you'll be able to use the service to transfer money from your bank account to an online merchant.</p>
<p>The service is extremely secure, a fact that is backed up by its widespread availability among prominent merchants. You don't need an account to use Klarna, unlike with many other payment methods, so they can't share your information with third parties. In fact, this data is encrypted and stored safely so you can be certain of your privacy.</p>
<p>One downside to Klarna is its availability. Outside of its native Scandinavia, only a handful of European countries host the service, while the USA and Australia are the only non-European countries on its participant list. The players outside these nations can't make the most of Klarna's service, however this might change in the future.</p>
<p>Using Klarna in online casinos</p>
<p>Once you've found the best Klarna casino for you to play on, you'll have to make a deposit via Klarna to start playing games. Klarna acts as an intermediary between your bank account and the casino, so you'll have to take the following steps to deposit money.</p>
<p>First, set up an account with the casino in question, and make sure you're registered with Klarna. Then, go to the casino's cashier and select Klarna — sometimes known as SOFORT — from the payment methods in the deposit section. From here you need to enter your bank's login details (password, PIN and account number) and the deposit amount. After confirming the above details, you should see the funds in your casino account, and Klarna won't charge any fee for this service.</p>
<p>You should be able to withdraw funds using Klarna, in which case you repeat the above process, but in the withdrawals section of the casino site. However, bear in mind that this may incur charges — always check the terms and conditions for these — and it may take a few days for the money to land in your bank account. Also, some Klarna casinos might allow you to deposit money but not to withdraw it, so always make sure you know this, too.</p>

<p>Bonuses offered by Klarna casinos</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about a new Klarna casino, then a no deposit bonus or a welcome bonus can be a great way to get to grips with it.</p>
<p>To find those Klarna casinos that offer bonuses, head to our list of casino bonuses and select the 'Klarna' option in the 'Payment Method' filter. You can also sort these by bonus type, just by going to the 'Bonus Type' section and clicking the required variation — for no deposit bonuses, for instance, click the 'No Deposit Bonus' option.
