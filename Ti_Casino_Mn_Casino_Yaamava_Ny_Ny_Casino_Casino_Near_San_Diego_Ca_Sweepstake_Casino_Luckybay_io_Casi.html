    <h1>Ti Casino Mn Casino Yaamava Ny Ny Casino Casino Near San Diego Ca Sweepstake Casino Luckybay io Casi</h1>

<p>It won't let me enter 0.2158LTC so I put 2158LTC.</p>
<p>I believe this casino is the worst I have ever played at and I have played at some real crap holes.</p>
<p>I believe their score at this site should be drastically altered, based on my experience.</p>
<p>I signed up and used their welcome bonus and noticed that when I had a win of ~$154 it was not added to my balance.</p>
<p>I asked live support why and they said email support, so I did.</p>
<p>Eventually they said that any win over $20 is removed.</p>
<p>That's right, any win on any spin that is over $20 is not credited.</p>
<p>Astounded I decided to play with cash instead next with no bonus as those terms are ridiculous.</p>
<p>My balance was something like $0.07 but to be safe I asked support to remove any active bonus and they stated:</p>
<p>"All promotions are now cancelled and expired. "</p>
<p>I also looked under Active Bonuses and it was empty.</p>
<p>And so I deposited $50 cash with no bonus.</p>
<p>I did probably about $250 of spins but noticed I could not withdraw.</p>
<p>I noticed then it said that wagering was 82.94% complete which seemed odd, but I did another $50 or so wagering and figured that would be enough since I asked live chat what the wagering was and they said "$20". Astoundingly the wagering was now only 83.32% complete.</p>
<p>I knew this couldn't be right so I emailed them again, they then said wagering was 5x.</p>
<p>I asked why, if it was 5x, a $5 bet only lowered the Wagering Required by 0.03% instead of 2%, had no response, complained about no response and then they gave me this, frankly shocking response:</p>
<p>"Dear user,</p>
<p>If you wish to be blocked, and get the money you have left withdrawn No worries.</p>
<p>Don't threathen the support team and please read what is said.</p>
<p>The wager amount that you have is not % based on your latent deposit. It is with the deposit you made before and the latest one. The fact that you are losing does not affect the language and way that you speal with the support.</p>
<p>Once more, the wager is 5 x. But the % is not based on your 5 x oj the latest deposit. "</p>
<p>So- what they are saying is that if you have ever taken a bonus with them, you will NEVER be able to withdraw your money until you have cleared absolutely every single bonus that you have ever claimed and failed to clear with them.</p>
<p>This needs to be noted on their review here as I have never seen more unfair terms.</p>
<p>Thank you for hopefully bringing light to this, I do not care about my balance there, they can keep it as I never want to log back in- I just want people to know not to play there.</p>
