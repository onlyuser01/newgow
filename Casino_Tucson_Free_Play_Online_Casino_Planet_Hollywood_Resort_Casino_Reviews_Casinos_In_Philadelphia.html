    <h1>Casino Tucson Free Play Online Casino Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Reviews Casinos In Philadelphia</h1>

<p>On the 30th May I won £670 at Casino Redkings. I uploaded all the relevant documents (which were all verified - email proof can be provided) a few days later there was no update. So I tried to speak with an advisor via live chat on the 3rd June. I had also sent two emails (no response)</p>
<p>On the 10th June (unsure of time) an advisor named Christopher, did respond (via live chat) he stated that they had reviewed my account and could see that my request for a withdrawal in the amount of 670 GBP, dated 30/5/2022 was placed on hold as they could not send the balance to the method i requested (deposited via Apple Pay)</p>
<p>The department required my bank details in order to process the withdrawal (via Wire Transfer) Christopher (advisor) was delighted to of received a response, so emailed support@redkings.com (as advised in the live chat from customer) with my account details - plus Swift/BIC code, as also requested. A message was also left in the live chat thread to advise that this has been done. On 13th June (via email) I received an automated request from redkings. They asked that for I.D (debit card) as I had already uploaded proof of address - proof of I.D - proof of banking, this was sent (last first and last four digits of my card) uploaded again via there documents page. I had an email the next day (14/6/22) stating that this had been verified. I have not received any other emails to advise when I will receive my withdrawal. From the 30/5/22-16/6/22 I have sent eight email (with no response) from the 30/5/22-16/6/22 I have sent twenty one live chat messages, only receiving one response. I have all screen shot proof which can provided (included my pending withdrawal of £670) it’s sad that you have to take additional measures/intervention. I have been very patient, but just want my withdrawal.</p>
