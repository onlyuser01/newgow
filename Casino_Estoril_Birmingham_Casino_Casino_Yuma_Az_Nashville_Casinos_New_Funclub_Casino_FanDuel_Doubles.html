    <h1>Casino Estoril Birmingham Casino Casino Yuma Az Nashville Casinos New Funclub Casino FanDuel Doubles</h1>

<p>FanDuel is happy to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Problem Gambling Awareness Month by doubling down on its responsible gambling efforts</p>
<p>FanDuel will highlight the importance of safer gambling through a series of initiatives, the company announced. The leading NA operator will also donate money to the National Council on Problem Gambling and other organizations to further support a healthier gambling ecosystem.</p>
<p>As announced, FanDuel will donate $100,000 to the NCPG, supporting its Agility Grants program. The program provides funding to nonprofits across the USA, helping them prevent problem gambling in regions without dedicated safer gambling services.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, executive director of the NCPG, praised FanDuel’s commitment.</p>

<p>FanDuel will also expand its support of the International Center for Responsible Gaming, funding problem gambling research in the United States. The ICBG hopes to better understand addictive tendencies in order to be able to better tackle them. Arthur Paikowsky, the center’s president, welcomed FanDuel’s backing.</p>
<p>FanDuel will also continue to work with various professional sports leagues, such as the NBA and the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Ambassadors Will Promote the Play Well Suite</p>
<p>In addition to supporting various organizations, FanDuel will also leverage its ambassadors to promote responsible gambling. Craig Carton, one of the company’s RG ambassadors, is currently on a “Responsible Gaming College Tour.” Carton visits college campuses across the northeast, educating young adults on how to avoid gambling harm and will produce exclusive video material on the topic.</p>
<p>Seven-division boxing champion Amanda Serrano, another Fanduel RG ambassador, will share video content on her social media. Serrano and Carton will encourage customers to pick FanDuel because of its Play Well tools, which allow players to regulate their own behavior.</p>
<p>During Problem Gambling Awareness Month, it’s even more important to remind those who choose to wager of the tools and resources available to them to help stay in control of the way they play. Amanda Serrano, RG ambassador, FanDuel</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Play Well suite includes a variety of tools. By using them, players can set deposit limits, wager limits, maximum wager size limits and time limits. In addition, players can use the Time Out option to take a break from betting.</p>
<p>Howe Promised FanDuel Will Remain Responsible</p>
<p>FanDuel’s chief executive officer, Amy Howe, addressed the new initiatives.</p>
<p>This March marks the 20th anniversary of Problem Gambling Awareness Month, and we will once again use this as a moment to demonstrate how FanDuel aims to set the standard for what it means to be a responsible operator. Amy Howe, CEO, FanDuel</p>
<p>Howe concluded that the collaborations with partners and ambassadors will help FanDuel continue to spread awareness and encourage players to play safely.</p>
