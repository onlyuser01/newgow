<p>An Entain study of changing behaviors of consumers in the UK covering 16,000 people revealed gaming and technology are well accepted not only by young people, but midlife dads are among the most enthusiastic gamers.</p>
<p>Video Gamer Dads Are Potential Bettors</p>
<p>The study also found out mid-aged dads are big social media users, watch esports and are well acquainted with virtual reality (VR), but have retained their preference to playing consoles like PlayStation, Blackberry and Xbox.</p>
<p>“Enthusiasm for gaming, mobile, and more social forms of interactive entertainment is far from confined to younger generations. People of all ages – particularly middle-aged dads – enjoy gaming and seem to love experimenting with new and exciting content.” Dom Grounsell, Deputy Director, Digital, Entain</p>
<p>The research revealed that men with children are more likely to engage in gaming time and watch esports than those who have no kids, while compared to women, men aged between 25 and 44 are twice as likely to spend time gaming and watching esports.</p>
<p>“We’re developing new interactive entertainment experiences, with more gaming and social features, because it’s increasingly clear this is what people want.” Dom Grounsell, Deputy Director, Digital, Entain</p>
<p>The study found a conclusive link between betting and gaming with video gamers being more than four times more likely to engage in betting or online gambling than those who do not spend time on video games. Video gamers are also more open to using social media features, too.</p>
<p>Research Findings</p>
<p>Data revealed 59% of British dads in the 25-44 age group play video games every week, compared to just 29% of the women in the same age group, while 56% of men with children in the UK also play games on mobile and 84% use social media.</p>
<p>Adults under the age of 24 remain the biggest gamers with as 53% of them playing on a computer or video game every week, but those in the 25-34 age group and 35-44 age group are not much behind with 46% and 36%, respectively. A similar tendency is uncovered in esports watching where 10% of the under 24s watch esports on a weekly basis, followed closely by 25-34 aged with 9% and 35-44 with 6%.</p>
<p>As for social media, the under 24s lead the pack with 92% of them engaging on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, but high numbers were also registered in the next two categories: 89% of those aged between 25-34 and 85% of those aged 35-44.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of other research studies commissioned by Entain, the share of adults watching esports in the future is expected to more than double across its markets: to 37% from 15% in the UK, to 40% from 17% in the US, to 52% from 22% in Italy, and to 55% from 21% in Span.</p>
<p>Also considering the demand for immersive gaming experiences, 60% in the 35-44 year-olds and 57% in the under 35s, Entain is planning on launching innovative new experiences built around VR and mobile.</p>
