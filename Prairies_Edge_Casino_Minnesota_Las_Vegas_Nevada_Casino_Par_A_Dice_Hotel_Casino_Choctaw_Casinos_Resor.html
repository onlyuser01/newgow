<p>Oscar Brodkin, a long-time executive in the firm, will take on the new position, reporting directly to the company chief commercial officer Eduard Blonk.</p>
<p>New Managing Director for APAC</p>
<p>Swiss-based sports technology, data, and content company Sportradar Group announced the promotion of Oscar Brodkin as the new managing director for Asia-Pacific (APAC). Brodkin’s career highlights in the company include his past positions as managing director of risk intelligence and director of intelligence and investigation companies (I&amp;I) before that. With the new position, Brodkin will be based in Singapore and will supervise the business and sales functions of Sportradar for the APAC region, and manage pertaining business strategies and partnerships. Brodkin commented on his announcement:</p>
<p>“As we look to innovate and equip the sports industry through impactful technological solutions, I look forward to working closely with the talented team in APAC and helping Sportradar further strengthen our position as the world’s leading sports technology company.” Sportradar managing director for APAC Oscar Brodkin</p>
<p>Brodkin’s experience in Asia spans more than nine years, including some significant achievements, like helping the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to tackle match-fixing and playing key roles in developing sports integrity programs at Asian sports organizations such as The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) and more.</p>
<p>“Oscar’s in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Asian sports landscape and experience in building as well as nurturing relationships with leading sports organizations make him well suited for this role,” said Blonk, adding that “Oscar has been an integral part of Sportradar and will now drive the business and sales efforts in the region while continuing to deliver unrivaled experiences to our clients and partners.”</p>
<p>Current, Future Outlook Mostly Good</p>
<p>This news comes after a good 1Q22 revenue result, albeit it was accompanied by an offsetting increase in spending for the period accounted for. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was up 31% over 1Q2021, but spending was reported to be up 30-35%, somewhat overshadowing the otherwise impressive result. Hiring more people and changes in the COVID-19-situation globally have been key bullet points when explaining the Q1 financial results.</p>
<p>US-based operations were up 124% to €25.7 million ($27 million) driven by legal changes in state laws, allowing sports betting. Rest of the world (RoW) betting was up 25% year-over-year (YoY) to €86.7 million ($91 million), and RoW audiovisual was up 17% YoY to €45.9 million ($48.2 million).</p>
<p>Building on that, Sportradar is continuing its expansion in the segment with more innovation, deploying a new dedicated virtual cricket in-play product, and creating a new experience for cricket fans. And, as plans for the future go, Sportradar is looking at a partnership with Australian Ice Hockey for a new data contract, further affirming the company’s commitment to collaring fraud in sports and sports gambling.</p>
