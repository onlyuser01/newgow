    <h1>Swinomish Casino And Lodge Casino Boni Casino Near Me Now Stars Casino Bonus Code Casino Hotel In Re</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently had a big hit in the "zoome" online casino (won around €8,000 for a €2 bet)</p>
<p>after about a month i finally managed to verify myself (had to upload a total of 9 documents, which was very strange, with other sites of the same "DAMA. NV group it was always 3-4), now my account simply blocked.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a payout of €1000, I applied for it and when I wanted to see whether it had already been processed about 3 days after the payout, when I tried to log in I got the message that my account was blocked.</p>
<p>Since yesterday I've been in contact with support as to why my account with a credit of €8,000 was blocked.</p>
<p>then i get the same answer over and over again: "the system would have discovered a second account and i should also have violated the terms and conditions." (It said, for example, "cheating, suspicious bonus activities, violating the terms, and it was always said that I violated point 10 in the terms and conditions, and this point consists of about 20 different points that lead to a ban , against which exactly I would have violated, I never found out)</p>
<p>I DEFINITELY DO NOT have a second account on this site as I know that this always leads to the player being banned.</p>
<p>I also didn't cheat or anything like that, I wouldn't even know how to "cheat" with something like that.</p>
<p>When I ask which terms and conditions I have violated exactly, I always get the ridiculous answer that this reason is "internal to the company" and therefore cannot be communicated to me.</p>
<p>there are more emails than the ones in the attachment, but the support seems to repeat itself constantly, never really responds to my accusations and always writes the same thing.</p>
