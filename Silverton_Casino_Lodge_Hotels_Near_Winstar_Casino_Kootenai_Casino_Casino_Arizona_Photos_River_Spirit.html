    <h1>Silverton Casino Lodge Hotels Near Winstar Casino Kootenai Casino Casino Arizona Photos River Spirit</h1>

<p>Goodnight,</p>
<p>My name is artur</p>
<p>On Friday an email arrived, telling me that if I entered a minimum of € 20 they would give me € 100 to play in bonuses.</p>
<p>So I decided to enter € 20 to play a little, you gave me the bonus and I had € 120.</p>
<p>With those € 120 I could win up to € 1,519, but I could not withdraw them, because he told me that I had to reach approximately € 3000 in bets to be able to withdraw them.</p>
<p>What did I do? I hit that amount by playing and then decided to finally withdraw a total amount of € 1,113.</p>
<p>When making the withdrawal, later an email arrived asking me for specific information, to confirm my validity as a user and to be able to make the withdrawal effective.</p>
<p>After sending those details, I receive an email the day after my withdrawal has been canceled ?????</p>
<p>I go into the chat to talk to one of his agents, and he tells me that the bets should not be less than € 6 since it is 30% of what is deposited in order to withdraw the money.</p>
<p>He did not understand anything, because that is not recorded at any time on his WEB page.</p>
<p>So, I have asked BEATRICE (A chat agent) to return the money earned € 1519 since that amount, I won with the initial € 120 making maximum bets of € 5.</p>
<p>It seems to me a hesitation to the end user in this case me, because when I win they take away all the money? Is that what you do with your clients? They only send emails for us to enter and then if they win, don't they pay? Is that your policy?</p>
<p>I want my money as soon as possible in my account</p>
