    <h1>We Ko Pa Casino Gold Fish Casino Casinos Cerca De M Nolimitcoin Casino Red Rocks Casino Las Vegas Vu</h1>

<p>I pushed the investigation much beyond you or anyone not related to casinos and i can assure you that you are on the right track. Just quit, you are wasting your time as you will never stop seeing these wins related to your losses and it will become even worst when you figure more things as i did. I don't "hype" online anymore. I don't enjoy big wins because they are the % of my losses back meaning after i am guaranteed to lose no matter where or what i play till next "loss refund" disguised as wins.</p>
<p>I kept telling people for years... "games are set to give the exact RTP and everything is controlled... if you listen to them you will indeed see your RTP over years is spot on. But the thing is.. it is not spot on because of odds or anything. It is spot on because it is controlled to be spot on. It is all controlled we can't win long term in that system. The 0.0000001% odds of being that lucky mofo... that doesn't exist. We pay for a simulation of casino. That's why they have the term about playing and depositing only for entertainment purposes. Cause that's all it is a game.. a simulation... algorythms that redistribute and control your RTP depending oon your actions, bets and results. What happened to you yesterday have a direct effect on your outcome today and tomorrow etc. It is not random, we just don't know what is coming but they do.</p>
<p>There are AI's algorythms that control all this. It controls the players, us. It show us things, make things happens in ways that entice you into wagering more, betting bigger, play longer, to the last cent. It become so crazy i just can't play anymore i am totally addicted but to something i came to understand, does not exist. You saw the tricks, you figured the most important and it will either make you quit over time or drive you completly crazy. Careful... remember.. we can only win what we lost... if we profit, it is a temporary loan that games will take back from you in the future making it literally impossible to win unless you quit everytime you hit lol.</p>
<p>p.s.: A typical cycle for me is to play and always lose then at some point one day it starts hitting everything like magic then i know i check my losses -1200$.. fine i know my "potential" where it will die. Then no matter where i go or what i do i hit and rip but run with over 100% RTP till i get the last hit that gets me around 1200$ usually looks like 1200$- house edge . Then when i tried to push id only win more cauz i lost more and if i stop losing that much then ii never hit again. If i push and "luck out" and with 1200$ losses i hit 2400$ then i know that next 1200$ wagered will pay back 0.. no matter where.. cauz i capped my losses and i have sme profits. Profits have 0% RTP on all games. Thats why everyone that win big always die straight after and everyone wonders how it was possible.. well its programmed.. it is computers... forget rng and fairytales its much much darker.</p>
