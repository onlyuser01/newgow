<p>The New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills meet for the second time in the 2023 NFL season</p>
<p>The two AFC East rivals meet for the second time in the 2023 NFL season, almost exactly ten weeks after the Jets beat the Bills 22-16 after overtime. It was a real shock given that Buffalo was a betting favorite with the NFL moneyline odds of -141.</p>
<p>The Jets’ odds moved even further against them after quarterback Aaron Rodgers got injured. But his replacement Zach Wilson did a fine job, helping his team grab a win. Can he do it again in Week 11? Not if you’re asking bookmakers who see the Bills as 7-point favorites.</p>

<p>New York Jets Keep Dreaming of Playoffs</p>
<p>The New York Jets haven’t made it to the playoffs since 2010. Ahead of the 2023 NFL season, their expectations were high, particularly after they signed legendary quarterback Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he picked up a season-ending injury on his Jets debut. However, his teammates have been doing okay without him. They’re 4-5 on the season, which actually isn’t too bad considering that other teams from the AFC East have been underachieving.</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins are currently top of the divisional table with a 6-3 record, while the Buffalo Bills are in second place with a 5-5 record. So, if the Jets beat the Bills again, the two will have the same record. Even if that doesn’t help them win the division, they’d still get a good chance to challenge for a Wild Card entry to the postseason.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills Need to Dig Themselves Out of the Pit</p>
<p>The Bills lost two of their last three games, which is a horrible run for a team that was (and still is by many) considered one of the top Super Bowl candidates. The worst thing is that the teams that defeated Buffalo aren’t really world-beaters, excluding the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Bills suffered a loss to the Denver Broncos at Highmark Stadium. It wasn’t a huge loss (24-22), but Buffalo entered this game as an eight-point favorite.</p>
<p>"After last night's loss, you can officially say the Bills are no longer Super Bowl contenders."</p>

<p>Obviously, something’s not right with the Bills, but can anyone point out the key problem? We think it’s their passing game which has been kind of anemic over the last six weeks. QB Josh Allen and his teammates have scored no more than two passing TDs in each of their last six games.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they did very well running the ball with Allen himself scoring 7 rushing TDs this season, four of which happened in the last four games (one in each game).</p>
<p>New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills have been doing great rushing-wise, but the problem is that the Jets are great when it comes to rushing defense. They’re in the shared seventh spot when it comes to opponents’ rushing TDs, conceding just 0.6 per game on average.</p>
<p>That said, we don’t expect the Bills to blow the Jets out on Sunday. But we do expect Buffalo to end its horrible run.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win but not cover the 7-point spread; under to hit</p>
