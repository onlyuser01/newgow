    <h1>Casinos Online Tunica Casino California Las Vegas Casino Eagle Pass Casino Kickapoo Casino Royale Po</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.lilibet.com/page/terms-conditions#Bonuses:</p>
<p>„3.2. All games from Amatic, Microgaming and games of other providers, presented by Microgaming (2By2, AdoptIt, Alchemy Gaming, All41 Studios, Big Time Gaming, Crazy Tooth Studio, D-Tech, Electric Elephant, Fantasma, Fortune Factory Studios, Foxium, Gameburger Studios, Gamevy, Genesis Gaming, Golden Rock Studios, Gong Gaming, Hacksaw Gaming, Half Pixel Studios, JFTW, Lightning Box Games, MGA, Neko Games, Neon Valley Studios, NextGen, Old Skool, Pear Fiction, Plank Gaming, Probability Jones, Pulse 8, Rabcat, Realistic Games, Skillzz Gaming, Slingshot Studios, Snowborn Studios, SpinPlay Games, Storm Gaming, Stormcraft Studios, Switch Studios, Triple Edge Studios, Zonelock), are restricted for promotions in our website and have 0% wagering contribution. Wagering on any of the mentioned providers may result in bonus cancellation and seizing of any winnings gained."</p>
<p>Even though I must say that the list of forbidden games for the bonus play is rather long, if you are aware of placing bets on restricted games while wagering your bonus, sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed. We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing bets on restricted games, but, unfortunately, this is not a standard practice yet.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you feel that you have been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
