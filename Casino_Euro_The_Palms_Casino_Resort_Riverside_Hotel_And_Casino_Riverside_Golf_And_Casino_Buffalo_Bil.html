<p>Relax Gaming has appointed Nadiya Attard as the company’s new chief commercial officer. Attard brings a wealth of experience, which Relax Gaming will put to good use as part of her new stint within the company.</p>
<p>A familiar face in the firm, Attard has worked with Relax since 2020, when she joined as director of sales. With a cumulative experience of over 20 years across different verticals of the iGaming sector and familiarity with both the B2B and B2C segment, Attard has worked for the likes of NetEnt, Microgaming, and Betfair.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Shifts Nadiya Attard to Spearhead Commerce</p>
<p>Her new role will allow her to leverage her unique understanding of the industry and drive stronger results in delivering sales results and overall performance. She is well-versed in areas such as regulation, which is proving an important factor for the company’s future sustained growth.</p>
<p>Attard is taking over from Daniel Eskola, who will step in as deputy CEO. Eskola was fully committed to the position of chief commercial officer back in 2019, seeking to improve Relax Gaming’s results and achieving close to 600% growth during his stint. Eskola commented:</p>
<p>“I am very proud of the commercial team, which has delivered phenomenal growth in a highly competitive market. After committing to two years as CCO and all targets delivered, it is time to hand over the reins to Nadiya who has been outstanding from day one.” Relax Gaming CEO Daniel Eskola</p>
<p>Eskola spoke about the commercial success that Relax has been able to achieve over the past couple of years. Relax now works with over 300 operators, and the company is in all likelihood going to add to its list of partners.</p>
<p>Relax Seeks to Continue Delivering on Triple-Digit Growth</p>
<p>New markets are already looming on the horizon, and more special projects are already in the pipeline for 2022. Attard herself welcomed the opportunity and recapped her experience with Relax Gaming so far:</p>
<p>“With a continued focus on team growth, development, empowerment, and collaboration, I know we will continue to exceed expectations as we continue to drive differentiation and expand into new regulated markets.” Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Relax Gaming currently offers over 3,000 online casino games it has been able to accumulate through third-party partners and distributed through its proprietary Silver Bullet and Powered by Relax platforms and partnerships. Relax recently joined forces with GAN and increased Silverback Gaming’s global exposure.</p>
