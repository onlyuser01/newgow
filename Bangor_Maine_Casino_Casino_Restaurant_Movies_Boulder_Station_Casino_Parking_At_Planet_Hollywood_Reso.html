<p>US gambling operator Bally’s Corporation has launched an awareness campaign for its $650 million casino resort in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>“Bally’s for RVA” Campaign</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation, a US provider of land-based casinos and gambling entertainment, rolled out Tuesday its “Bally’s for RVA” campaign to raise support for its proposed $650 million resort near Richmond, Virginia. The operator submitted a proposal for the construction of the casino last month.</p>
<p>Located on the western border of Richmond, east of Chippenham Parkway, and north of Powhite Parkway, the gambling facility would be built on a 61-acre site and feature a hotel, a casino, and a sportsbook.</p>
<p>With 2,500 slot machines, 90 table games, 30 poker tables, and a sports betting booth, as well as a VIP lounge and a high-limit gaming area, the 117,500 square foot casino would also feature 250 guest rooms. Furthermore, Bally’s plans to build a 45,000 square foot center for events and meetings, a spa, and 13 drinking and dining outlets.</p>
<p>Richmond’s Decision Expected Next June</p>
<p>In order to approve the construction of Bally’s new casino-resort, the City of Richmond must first select a gambling operator and a location before having a vote by referendum to decide on the future wagering property. Richmond legislators are expected to weigh in on Bally’s proposal in June this year.</p>
<p>In anticipation, Bally’s has launched “Bally’s for RVA”, an awareness and support campaign, to demonstrate how the planned resort would benefit Richmond, with a $100 million upfront payment to the city.</p>
<p>The initiative would also show how the project could provide 4,300 construction jobs and more than 2,000 permanent positions once completed. The resort is expected to bring up to 3.7 million tourists each year. Over a 10-year period, it is projected to generate $5.3 billion in economic value.</p>
<p>Bally’s CEO Notes “Community-First Policy”</p>
<p>Bally’s CEO George Papanier said the firm is confident in its Richmond casino proposal, noting its “community-first policy” and the solid, long-term relationships built between Bally’s and the locals and businesses wherever it operates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bally’s will highlight programs that will support the Richmond community, such as an interactive program that encourages players and visitors to redeem their prizes at local stores.</p>
<p>Bally’s For RVA will also recognize how the operator has agreed that the Lanier Family will be taking a minority ownership interest in the resort, as well as providing building and development services via Lanier United, Willie Lanier Jr.’s real estate construction and development company. Darrell Green, former football player and member of the NFL Hall of Fame, as well as Warren Thompson and his catering and facilities management company, Thompson Hospitality Corporation, have agreed to buy a minority stake in the property.</p>
