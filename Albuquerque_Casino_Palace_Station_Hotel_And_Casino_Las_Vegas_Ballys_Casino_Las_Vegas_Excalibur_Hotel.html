<p>partypoker shut down 13 poker bots in September</p>
<p>Since December 2018, the operator has eliminated over 650 bots from the site</p>
<p>A sign that bot activity could be coming to an end on partypoker</p>
<p>Partypoker has been on a mission to shut down all of the bots on its sites, and it has been doing a tremendous job so far. In September, the number of eliminated bots was down from previous months – which is a good sign overall.</p>
<p>The initiative was started in December 2018 and, since then, partypoker has shut down over 650 bots and reclaimed $1.1 million from fraudulent accounts. The mission has proven to be a great success, and it could be putting an end to partypoker bots altogether.</p>
<p>In August, partypoker shut down 48 bot accounts and recovered $180,000. In September, that number dropped to just 13 bots. What this seems to indicate is that there are fewer bots on the network overall.</p>
<p>It is also a sign that the cheaters who run the bot accounts are avoiding partypoker. The initiative has certainly dissuaded anyone considering using bots to stay away, and there is the possibility off a bot-free future on the site.</p>
<p>“The site continues to invest in resources aimed at safeguarding the safety of its players,” reads a statement from a recent partypoker press release.</p>
<p>The initiative to eliminate bots is comprised of a specialist Poker Fraud Team. It is a group of former poker professionals, who work together to investigate any suspicious behaviour on the site. They have been doing a bang-up job so far, and will continue keeping players on partypoker safe.</p>
<p>The bot battle is just one of several things that partypoker has been doing to improve the player experience. Over the course of the last year, the operator has made a number of changes to its software that benefit recreational players as well as pros.</p>
<p>Firstly, decision times have been reduced both pre-flop and post-flop to keep the action moving across all games. The company also banned the use of HUDs (Heads Up Displays) to stop sharks from targeting more inexperienced players.</p>
<p>There are even more changes in store in the future, as well. Antes will be re-introduced in some cash games, and players will be able to export anonymous hand histories.</p>
<p>This is all part of partypoker’s FairPlay initiaitive, which has been holding true to its name. Thanks to the site’s commitment and hard work, players can really enjoy a fair and safe online poker experience.</p>
