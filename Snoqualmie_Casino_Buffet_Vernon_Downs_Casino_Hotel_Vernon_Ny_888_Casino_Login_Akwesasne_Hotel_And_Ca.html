<p>On Air Entertainment has launched its portfolio of games and products on the regulated iGaming market in the Netherlands. As a result, the company will be able to bring a series of products, and specifically localized live casino tables. The company is also cleared for launch with a number of tier-one operators, which will allow it to immediately take advantage of the newly-secured license in the market.</p>
<p>New Live Games for Players to Enjoy</p>
<p>On Air provides players with an excellent variety of live casino games that appeal to consumers and provide an immersive gaming environment. The live games use a highly-thematic studio environment that reminds players of their homeland and the user interface and live table support are spot-on to guarantee that people who join On Air games experience the best possible live options.</p>
<p>Operators who are keen on improving their dedicated live portfolio will have the chance to do so by tapping the numerous On Air Entertainment games available in the company’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the supplier is also working on a number of other games that will be coming throughout the year and be available to Dutch players as well.</p>
<p>Those include 9 Pots of Gold, Streamlcon Edition, 6 September, Eclipse Blackjack, and others. Thanks to this launch, On Air Entertainment is already available in nine regulated markets and runs a total of over 40 tables. The games are broadcast from the company’s dedicated studio in Riga and the company is also setting up new production facilities and studios in Bucharest, Romania, and Tsibli, Georgia in Q3 2022 and Q1 2023 respectively.</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment is determined to continue growing its footprint in the European and Dutch gaming markets. Commenting on this launch, company business development manager Dejan Loncar said that the firm was happy to be driving new successful forays into the live dealer market in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>This reflects the company’s broader ambition to establish itself deeper in the regulated European gaming markets in the future. Loncar is confident that with the availability of a dedicated Dutch studio environment and On Air Entertainment’s intuitive UI, consumers will have one of the best experiences to enjoy in the live segment.</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment has been moving confidently in the regulated gaming space in Europe, launching in Denmark previously.</p>
