    <h1>Legends Casino Buffet Casino Royale Vesper Lynd Big M Casino Boat Harrah S Maryland Heights Casino A</h1>

<p>XD there is nothing suspicious about my game logs huh? Alright then close the case. I can do this on my own. None of you complaint sites make it any easier for people who like to spend money and actually not have the damn software knock us down every time we get a win. If that's how you like slots then count me out. I'm all for losing the normal amount. Not being smashed by the system that was triggered because I am over its RTP for once in my life. Give me a break. People like you are the reason why these guys get away with way more than a house edge. It's a house landslide. I was wondering why I could spend 10000 dollars in 2 months and not win anything. It's because they don't have to answer to anyone and you guys think its normal to lose 125 spins in a row probably. Well you lay in it. I'm not a damn retard. I'm sorry but if you didn't care enough to do the math then why do you even run a complaint page? Is it to keep up appearances? You own one of these casinos that scam old ladies out of their disability checks while you lie to them and tell them its a random number generated game? You think it's normal to be attacked every time you don't run away with your tail tucked between your legs after you win? Just wait. I hope you own a casino or are involved and paid off by one. Because I'm going to let everyone know what pseudo random number generators are. They are on highly sophisticated software platforms that are incredible at math. The crush numbers like you wouldn't believe. But the sad part about this is that they have 2 main purposes and tasks they follow. One is to simulate random so well that sometimes you can't tell if it is random or not. The other objective is to keep all their customers at the set payout the casinos choose though their very handy client software. It even alerts them when someone is winning above whatever amount they want to stay informed of. I don't know why they would want to know when someone wins like that other than to maybe be one step ahead and already start processing the withdrawal by the time the customer heads over. Or is it so the can fiddle with settings behind the scene that interfere with a normal game of chance. Now I don't know if that is true or not but one thing I do know is that the set payouts are carried out by these super computers and plot out long elaborate algorithms to take you down... Now this is how the casinos get you. The longer you play the more of a right they have to taking all of your money and not having to answer to anyone. All they have to do is lead you on just long enough to where the rtp of the slot is fullfilled when it strips you of all your money. I know all of you real people out there who are not made of money know what I am talking about. How it always seems like one way or another you lose right? sometimes it can get pretty creative with your demise. So that history I showed him says exactly what I said. The slot was steady eating on my money but it can only do so if its RTP on the slot is obeyed. its their get out of jail free card when you lose 100 times and wonder why. So like me if you stuck around and you were not aware that the software was taking you down a long trap and you don't run right after you win then you will lose 98 percent of the time. The software has a battle going on inside of it. On one hand it has to obey the RTP. Another hand it has to blend in and give as little cause to suspect its not being rtandom as possible. Then it has to plot out an algorithm to take you down that will not scare you off too fast and keeps you engaged. Thats why you probably get like 10 near wins but never get one. Well tthat slot Lava Gold is the perfect storm for a customer. It will let you win up to where you raise the bet a little. Then It will allow you maybe even a decent win. Then you raise the bet and think to yourself that you got thorugh it all day with the normal hiccups. Ups and downs all day with alot less.</p>
