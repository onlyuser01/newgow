<p>Champions League Betting: Messi Genius Proves Difference Between Barcelona and Liverpool in Semi-Final</p>

<p>Barcelona was the favorite going into last night’s Champions League first-leg semi-final, as is it with every match it plays – especially since the apparent implosion of Real Madrid. But for long spells at Camp Nou on Wednesday, Barca was made to look second best by a Liverpool side set up to press and attack, particularly in the second half.</p>

<p>That the Spanish team ended the match 3-0 winners against the run of play is slightly freakish — a testament to luck, sure, but also to genius.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi’s 600th goal for Barcelona, his second on the night, was a sublime 35-yard free kick, curled deliciously around the wall into the top corner, that left even Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp grinning from ear to ear at the wonder of it all.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if we can play much better,” Klopp told the BBC. “I think it was the best away game in the Champions League — not only this year, last year included.</p>
<p>“I told the boys I’m proud of how we played,” he added. “Against a side like this, playing this kind of football, I was completely happy.</p>
<p>Barca Evens for Champions League Outright</p>
<p>In the second half, Liverpool had more possession than Barca (57.4 percent), made more passes (284 compared to 217) and had more shots on target (four compared to three).</p>
<p>But Messi was the difference between the two teams and the win sees a Barcelona fully in control going into the second leg, while Liverpool will be left to rue its failure to get the precious away goal it deserved.</p>
<p>Barcelona are now evens to win the Champions League for the first time since 2015. Bookies believe Liverpool has left itself with far too big a job to do at Anfield in one week’s time.</p>
<p>While Jurgen Klopp’s men are strong favorites to win the home leg (68/67), they would have to score more than three goals to progress to the final and – even trickier – prevent Barcelona and a certain little maestro from scoring deadly away goals.</p>
<p>Stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>Ajax in Control After Spurs Win</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spurs have also given themselves a lot to do after losing their semi-final 0-1 at home to tournament wildcards Ajax on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The Londoners missed their top scorer and captain, Harry Kane, through injury and second-top scorer, Heung-min Son, through suspension, and never quite got going against a sparky Ajax side who are proving their presence in the final four is no fluke.</p>
<p>Despite Son’s return next week, Spurs are 4/1 against turning it around in Amsterdam, while the Dutch side are now just 7/2 to claim the trophy. For a team that began the competition as a 200-1 long shot, that would be the biggest outsider story in Champions League history.</p>
