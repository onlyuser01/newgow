<p>Pacquiao To Get His Own Macau Slot Machine</p>

<p>Manny Pacquiao has been successful in boxing, politics, and as an entertainer. He has a huge following worldwide, especially in the Philippines and throughout Asia. So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Pacquiao will soon be the subject of his own slot machine, one that will debut in the Chinese gambling hub of Macau.</p>
<p>Boxing Icon Gets a Slot</p>
<p>Pacquiao is already scheduled to spend time in Macau later this year. On November 23, he’ll face off against American boxer Brandon Rios as part of a card designed to appeal both in China and around the world. But a couple months before that event, he’ll be making another trip to Macau to show off a new slot machine from Aristocrat Technologies that is based on his legendary boxing career.</p>
<p>“We’ll probably go first to the United States and then do an Asian tour including maybe Singapore and Macau,” said manager Eric Pineda in an interview with the Macau Business Daily.</p>
<p>The game, known as Mega Manny Jackpots, isn’t actually ready for distribution yet. However, a prototype version was on display at The Venetian Macau as a part of the Global Gaming Expo Asia 2013.</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpot</p>
<p>Mega Manny Jackpots will feature a progressive jackpot that players can shoot for while they enjoy famous moments from the boxing champion’s career. Of course, there are some artistic liberties taken as a part of the slot machine, as you’ll never see Pacquiao lose a fight during the game.</p>
<p>“It’s still under development, but it looks really good,” Pineda said. “It would be nice if they could make him look even more handsome.”</p>
<p>Given Pacquiao’s iconic status in both the boxing and Asian communities, there’s little doubt that Mega Manny Jackpots will prove to be a hit among Macau gamblers.</p>
<p>“Manny Pacquiao is such an iconic figure and such a hero in the region and across the world that we’re very excited to be involved with this product,” said David Punter, Aristocrat’s general manager for the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
