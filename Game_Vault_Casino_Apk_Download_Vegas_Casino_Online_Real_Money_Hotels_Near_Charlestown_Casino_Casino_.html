    <h1>Game Vault Casino Apk Download Vegas Casino Online Real Money Hotels Near Charlestown Casino Casino</h1>

<p>With sports betting still gaining ground in the US, Churchill Downs Inc. (CDI) isn’t going to leave anything to chance. The company announced last Friday that Ben Murr was named President of TwinSpires and Online Gaming, losing the “interim” tag that had been part of his title. He will be responsible to oversee the operations and strategy of these businesses.</p>
<p>TwinSpires Gets a Dedicated Boss</p>
<p>Murr brings 24 years of leadership experience. He has held multiple leadership positions over his 14-year tenure with CDI, including President of United Tote and Senior Vice President and Chief Tech Officer.</p>
<p>“During his tenure with CDI, Ben has been an important leader in the growth across our operations,” said CDI CEO William Carstanjen. “He has been a key player throughout the extensive changes in our Company over the last 14 years and will continue to move our TwinSpires and Online businesses forward.”</p>
<p>Being officially put in charge of TwinSpires is more of a formality than anything else. His latest title with the company was interim President at TwinSpires and Online Gaming.</p>
<p>Murr will continue to be a Senior Vice President at CDI, in addition to his responsibilities for President of TwinSpires Online Gaming and President of TwinSpires. However, the Company is moving quickly to fill the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Tech Officer.</p>
<p>Murr added in the announcement, “I’ve been heavily involved with TwinSpires and our Online Gaming operations throughout my tenure at CDI. I am passionate about these businesses and believe strongly in their future growth potential and strategic importance for CDI.”</p>
<p>CDI to Hold Onto TwinSpires</p>
<p>Reports that CDI might unload TwinSpires have fizzled out. A few weeks ago, Murr informed employees at a company-wide meeting that the company would not sell the online gaming business. Put succinctly, he stated, “There is no sale.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg had reported two weeks earlier that CDI was looking into the sale of TwinSpires. It estimated it could sell for up to $1.5 billion. According to the report, CDI had hired an advisor to assess buyer interest in its wagering platform.</p>
<p>CDI announced a year ago that it would rebrand its BetAmerica iGaming and sports betting platforms under the TwinSpires brand. It is live with sports betting in a number of states, with Louisiana set to be added. Full iGaming options have been added in Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
