    <h1>Speaking Rock Casino Fortuna Casino Four Queens Hotel And Casino 202 E Fremont Stream Casino Primm V</h1>

<p>Australian sports betting operator PlayUp has added Dennis Drazin to its Board of Director to strengthen its growth in the United States and globally.</p>
<p>A Brand New Team for a New Challenge</p>
<p>Premium betting entertainment group PlayUp has now appointed veteran industry expert and Hall of Famer Dennis Drazin as part of its team and Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Adding to his role as chairman and CEO of Darby Development, Drazin will work directly with PlayUp US chief executive Dr Laila Mintas. She joined the company earlier this year, providing a strategic role and advising the brand on a global perspective. She previously worked at Sportradar, which gives her a great deal of experience in the sector.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Mintas said she has “known Dennis for years” and is “very delighted to have him joining PlayUp´s global board of directors.”</p>
<p>Mintas, who is also a sports law professor at Columbia, highlighted Drazin’s considerable experience and knowledge in the field and said she was looking forward to working with him, as the team focuses on strengthening PlayUp’s presence in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>For his part, Drazin, who serves as chairman and chief executive of Monmouth Park stated, that he was pleased to join PlayUp and can’t wait to capitalize his many years of “experience and industry leadership to develop and expand PlayUp’s extensive strategy.”</p>
<p>Global CEO of PlayUp Daniel Simic said that he saluted Drazin’s influence in the U.S. betting industry and says he will bring a huge experience to the Board of Directors. He knows that this duo will do a lot to expand the company’s footprint. Simic also confirmed that “significant progress has been made to introduce fixed-odds horse racing in the USA and what better person to have on our board than the man helping to currently oversee the pilot program.”</p>
<p>A Major Asset to Help Drive Business in the USA</p>
<p>Drazin led a legal battle for nearly 7 years to have the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) overturned, with the U.S. Supreme Court finally reaching a decision in favor of the betting industry May 14, 2018. Owing to his significant success in establishing a legal betting industry in the United States, Drazin was inaugurated into the Sports Betting Hall of Fame in 2019.</p>
<p>Drazin is also in the process of launching fixed odds betting at Monmouth Park with BetMakers and PointsBet. Senator Vin Gopal submitted a bill earlier in November, which is currently reviewed by a committee to enable the launch.</p>
<p>In addition, the Australia-based betting operator raised $25 million at the beginning of November to finance its entry into the U.S. market through a non-refundable rights offering and has already been licensed to operate in New Jersey and Colorado.</p>
