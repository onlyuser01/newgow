<p>The provider of games, powering the global iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced it strengthened its existing partnership with Zamba, one of its Colombian partners. Details regarding the new collaboration emerged earlier this week, with the iGaming supplier confirming it agreed to provide additional games for Zamba.</p>
<p>As a result, customers of the Colombian operator will be able to benefit from thrilling games from Pragmatic Play's Live Casino vertical. This will bring fan-favorite games such as Sweet Bonanza Candyland and Snakes &amp; Ladders Live, among others, to Zamba's customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the operator's clients will be able to experience the thrill and excitement of classic casino games from Pragmatic Play such as blackjack and roulette. Overall, Zamba will access the iGaming supplier's entire suite of Live Casino games, significantly strengthening its offering.</p>
<p>Enrique Amorocho, Zamba's Business unit manager, commented on the topic in a statement released earlier this week. "Following the good performance of Pragmatic Play’s Slots among our players it was a good next step to build upon this relationship and offer its Live Casino content to our customers," he explained.</p>
<p>Finally, Amorocho added: "With the rise in popularity of the category among bettors, we have no doubt its Live Casino content will perform just as well as its Slots have, as we strive to provide an unmatched experience to our players. Pragmatic live casino arrives Zamba.co to complete our offer to our loyal customers."</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Vice President of Latin American Operations at ARRISE powering Pragmatic Play, shared the excitement and added: "Improving the relationship with Zamba to include Live Casino content forms part of our wider strategy to greatly expand Pragmatic Play’s reach within the category".</p>
<p>He spoke about the importance of the partnership for the company, explaining that it is exciting to grow their offering with the addition of Live Casino games. Finally, Arias said that the new collaboration will allow hit games such as Sweet Bonanza Candyland to reach new players.</p>
