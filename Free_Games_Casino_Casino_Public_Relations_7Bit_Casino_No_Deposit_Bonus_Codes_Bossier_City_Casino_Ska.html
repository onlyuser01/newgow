<p>review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Are you feeling in need of a holiday, but can’t find the time to get away from your desk? BF Games have you covered with their ultra-relaxing beach themed fruit machine: Lucky Tropics.</p>
<p>While not really as calming as a day under the sun with sand between your toes, there is something calming about Lucky Tropics beachside background and soft summer fruits. The symbols are all evocative of the kind of Caribbean paradise we all wish we could retire to.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The theme is rendered beautifully with an art style that is detailed without being crowded. The colours are bright and cheery and the animations eye-catching and encouraging when you land a win or net yourself a bonus spin.</p>
<p>The very calming background soundtrack is tropical birds singing by the gentle waves of a beach along with a very Hawaiian musical accompaniment of ukulele.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a lovely slot with a lot of atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game is pretty simple with its five by three grid and nine win lines.</p>
<p>Some spice is added in with the Gamble feature which is a beach combing themed twist on the red/black game. Here, the player tries to choose the starfish of the same colour as the next card. For those looking for a bit of a variance spike, the double or nothing nature of the game allows you to get that without sacrificing the very decent return to player (see below for details).</p>
<p>Along with this, there is a basic array of special symbols and a free spin bonus.</p>
<p>So nothing groundbreaking, but everything you need for a decent time playing slots.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatters. You can also win for just Wild combinations, but in cases where the Wild substitutes, the win is doubled.</p>
<p>The other special symbols are the Scatters which pay out wherever they fall. Two Scatters wins you twice your bet per spin, up to five hundred times your spin for hitting five Scatters on one spin.</p>
<p>A free Spin bonus is triggered by three or more Scatter symbols. In the Free Spin bonus you receive fifteen free spins and can retrigger another fifteen if you hit another combo of three Scatters.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 97.00% which is well above our rough estimate of the industry average (which is about 96%).</p>
<p>The range of bet on the site we tested was a minimum of $/£/€.0.09 all the way up to a maximum of $/£/€45.00. This is a good spread that covers most bankroll sizes.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred strategies. You can also increase the volatility further by playing the double or nothing game.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Lucky Tropics is a delightful slot machine. The gameplay is a little basic, but is all pretty solid.</p>
<p>Where it really shines is in its lovely design features, high RTP and higher volatility.</p>
<p>We recommend this slot whole-heartedly.</p>
