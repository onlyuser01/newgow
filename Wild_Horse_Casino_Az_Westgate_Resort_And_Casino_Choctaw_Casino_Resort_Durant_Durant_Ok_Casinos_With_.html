<p>Dolphin's Pearls Deluxe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dolphin’s Pearl Deluxe is a more or less unchanged update of Dolphin’s Pearl. Like the original, you play along with a treasure hunting dolphin and a collection of underwater creatures ranging from stingrays to angelfish.</p>
<p>There’s not a lot more to it, except that the goal is to get the pearl, which comes with the biggest rewards.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The creatures have been given an art style upgrade which helps with one of the biggest downsides of the original which was that it was a bit unpleasant to look at.</p>
<p>The game is still pretty much the same software underneath including the sound design and animations as the original as a result it still suffers from feeling dated and clunky. The reel-sounds and win-sounds, in particular, were just about acceptable in the original but in the update without the mitigation of historical context just feel tacky and annoying.</p>
<p>Overall this is a more polished game than the original.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is a five reel, ten winline slots, a small change upwards from the original’s nine winlines. You can play any number of lines up to ten.</p>
<p>The only real variation on push button play is the gamble feature which is the Novomatic standard of a red or black game, in which you must choose the colour of the next card drawn off a deck. Thanks to the random number generator this is always a coin flip and is mostly used to increase volatility if that is your prefered strategy.</p>
<p>Standard gamble feature from Novomatic</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There are two Symbols with additional features in Dolphin’s Pearl Deluxe.</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol, the Dolphin of the title. This symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and comes with a x2 multiplier for any wins it is a part of.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol, the Pearl of the title. This symbol pays out two times your bet per spin if you hit two of them. Three or more gets you fifteen free spins as well as your payout. The payouts go up to five hundred times your bet per spin for five Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>During the free spins, a x3 multiplier is in effect. This is where the real money is to be made and is a major reason for the game’s high volatility.</p>
<p>Award from 4 Scatter symbols hit is 15 Free spin rounds</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player is 95.13% for this slot machine. Lower than our benchmark for the average of around 96%. This is low enough to discourage us from playing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you play a high volatility strategy this game is famous for large swings. You will want to account for the long dry periods however in your bankroll management.</p>
<p>The website we tried playing on allowed a minimum bet of $/£/€0.04 per spin up to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€100.00.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Dolphin’s Pearl Deluxe does little to draw a player in. The features are stale, overused and unimaginative. Even with the upgraded graphics, the game is not especially fun to look at and the low RTP is a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>Although we do not recommend Dolphin’s Pearl Deluxe, it should be noted that hitting it big on the free spins with the multipliers can make for an attractive prospect and the game remains popular with a large group of players.</p>
