<p>Canadian betting-oriented sports and entertainment company FansUnite will spearhead into the US market through the strategic acquisition deal of the sports betting tech provider American Affiliate. The deal will see FansUnite pay American Affiliate about $58.2 million. Out of that total sum, $13.5 million will be paid in cash, $41.7 million in FansUnite shares and $3 million in deferred cash payments within 2 years.</p>
<p>The Acquisition Will Bring a Lot of Value to FansUnite</p>
<p>FansUnite first targeted the US market in January 2021 when it collaborated with OneComply to gain an operational license. With American Affiliate’s brand Betting Hero being a leading live activation company in the sports betting and iGaming industry, FansUnite will receive a stronger foothold in the region, especially considering American Affiliate’s pre-existing partnership deals with some of the top betting operators across the United States, including the likes of BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, WynnBet and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, American Affiliate’s assets have attracted more than 150,000 new depositing customers, according to the company. The Betting Hero brand was co-founded by Jai Maw and Jeremy Jakary in 2018. Since then, it has grown to have more than 25 employees, over 200 contractors and $10 million in revenue. The brand is licensed in 10 states and has had more than 10,000 activation events since its launch.</p>
<p>Other than Betting Hero, the American Affiliate acquisition will provide FansUnite with access to its other brands, namely the statistics platform BetPrep, the gambling news outlet and betting tracker Wagers and the news and media brand Props.</p>
<p>American Affiliate expects about $13.9 million of annual revenue for 2021 if it meets its optimal Q4 goals. This is expected to increase to $19.5 million in 2022. The American Affiliate acquisition deal is, therefore, strongly expected to significantly improve FansUnite’s revenues and EBITDA.</p>
<p>Entering the Affiliate Business Seemed Logical for FansUnite</p>
<p>Scott Burton, the chief executive officer of FansUnite Entertainment, has spoken about the acquisition and the importance of American Affiliate’s strong portfolio and world-class management team. Burton considers the acquisition of the latter company as the “most significant milestone for FansUnite to date.”</p>
<p>According to his own words, entering the affiliate business seemed the most logical strategic move in order to reach the worlds’ largest gambling companies. He explained:</p>
<p>“This transformative transaction will provide us further access to the lucrative US regulated sports betting and online gambling market, while generating accretive, high-margin revenue, expanding our leadership team, and accelerating the growth of our company’s footprint in the global gambling market.” Scott Burton, the chief executive officer of FansUnite Entertainment</p>
<p>He elaborated that the acquisition would put FansUnite in possession of an “unparalleled customer acquisition portfolio” that will boost the company’s appeal enough to “immediately capture share” in the wagering and iGaming market in the States.</p>
<p>Chris Grove, the chief executive officer of American Affiliate, added that the company’s team, combined with FansUnite’s portfolio “can drive shareholder value by building a leading customer acquisition network for the US sports betting and online casino market.</p>
<p>Grove’s forecast is further backed by the fact that FansUnite investors are already receiving the acquisition well, which has led to FansUnite stocks price increasing by 5.7% in Toronto and by 6% on the OTC Markets in New York.</p>
<p>The executive teams of the two companies will be further speaking about the agreement in a webinar scheduled for November 29. Investors are invited to register and join.</p>
