    <h1>Fire Kirin Casino Fishing Nys Casinos Casino Wins Fontainebleau Las Vegas Casino Online Casino Games</h1>

<p>PointsBet will continue to grow its footprint in Canada as the company’s country-focused subsidiary has entered into a multi-year deal with The Nation Network and Dailyfaceoff.com. As per the deal, PointsBet Canada is now the official and exclusive sports betting partner for the outlets.</p>
<p>Dailyfaceoff.com is touted as Canada’s leading fantasy statistics and information website which delivers real-time updates and actionable data to Canucks who enjoy sports betting and DFS. This includes curated hockey content by the likes of former TSN senior hockey reporter Frank Seravalli.</p>
<p>The website generates a lot of traffic by delivering actionable content in the form of opinion pieces and insights, breaking news that is substantiated by inside sources, statistics, and more. There are some 1.5 million monthly visitors with 500 million page views since the website was launched.</p>
<p>The Nation Network will allow PointsBet to access a number of affiliate sites that will help the operator gain more exposure to the newly-regulated sports betting market in Canada. The network now has over a billion page views and was founded in 2007 across 12 websites.</p>
<p>A Massive Network with Significance to Canadian Bettors</p>
<p>Oilersnation.com, which is The Nation Network’s leading website, reports over 19 million page views for another exciting monthly statistic.</p>
<p>The Nation Network focuses on empowering content creators who are also avid sports fans through various media formats that include podcasts, amateur, and professional journalism, and higher reader participation to achieve a committed and engaged audience.</p>
<p>PointsBet Canada CCO Nic Sulsky had this to add on the occasion of the partnership: “As PointsBet looks to establish a genuine connection with sports fans in Canada, there was no better place for us to start than the Daily Faceoff and the Nation Network’s loyal and dedicated following.”</p>
<p>The partnership was welcomed by The Nation Network and Dailyfaceoff.com CEO and co-founder Jay Downton who hailed PointsBet as the company’s ideal partner. “We are a company built by fans for fans, and we know what our users want to have incorporated into their experience. PointsBet’s expert analysis and suite of integrations will complement and enhance our content. We are excited to work and grow together,” Downton concluded.</p>
<p>PointsBet has extensive operations in the United States and Australia and now moves rapidly on the Canadian market as the company was one of the most vociferous proponents of the legalization of single-event sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>The company has been actively pursuing a bigger footprint in Canada with the appointment of Dale Fallon as senior director of product in the country, and the appointment of Scott Vanderwel as CEO of PointsBet Canada before that.</p>
