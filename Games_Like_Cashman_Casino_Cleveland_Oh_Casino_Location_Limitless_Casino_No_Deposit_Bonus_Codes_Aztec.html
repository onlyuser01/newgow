<p>Gaules is a former esports athlete and coach, as well as an avid video game personality and content creator</p>
<p>GG.BET, a betting company that seeks to be a trendsetter in esports wagering, has unveiled a partnership with Gaules, a major streamer and a former esports professional. The operator announced that it has been named as the official betting partner of the streamer’s Portuguese language broadcast of the upcoming BLAST Paris Major.</p>
<p>Alexandre Borba Chiqueta, also known as Gaules, is a former player and coach who has years of experience in competing professionally. His specialty was the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which he plays to this day.</p>
<p>Gaules started streaming in 2018, quickly becoming a sensation in Brazil. Prior to becoming a streamer, the Brazilian played Counter-Strike professionally, later becoming a coach. He played a huge role in professionalizing esports in his home country and is still popular to this day.</p>
<p>Gaules continues to stream on Twitch to this day. He boasts 3.9 million viewers on the Amazon-owned platform and is one of the most popular Portuguese-speaking content creators.</p>

<p>The Portuguese-language stream for the upcoming BLAST Paris Major will be held on Gaules’ official Twitch channel. The streamer will welcome GG.BET as the official betting partner of the broadcast and will promote the esports betting brand throughout the stream.</p>
<p>This will not be the first time Gaules has worked with GG.BET either. Back during the RMR qualifiers earlier this year, Gaules promoted the company during his official broadcast for the event. The gambling company’s brand was visible throughout the stream, tipping players on where to find some of the best esports betting products.</p>
<p>This time, Gaules subscribers will even be able t benefit from a promotional GG.BET deal. During the Major, subscribers to the streamers’ channel will get a bonus on the operator’s website.</p>
<p>Dmitry Voshkarin, GG.BET’s chief executive officer, commented on the deal, lauding Gaules as the most popular Brazilian esports talent. The CEO said that the content creator’s content is known to regularly attract more viewers than the biggest official tournament organizers’ streams, making him a perfect partner for GG.BET.</p>
<p>Voshkarin concluded that each deal with the esports personality is a “massive win” for the operator.</p>
<p>The BLAST Paris Major is set to begin on May 8 and will welcome 24 of the best teams in the world. It will be the final event before the professional circuit moves to Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>In February, GG.BET signed an anti-corruption education agreement with ESIC.</p>
