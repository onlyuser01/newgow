<p>Gaming Realms secures a partnership with BetMGM to increase its footprint in the U.S. market and bring quality Slingo content to American players.</p>
<p>BetMGM Joins Forces with Gaming Realms for Slingo Content</p>
<p>Gaming Realms continues to work on its footprint in the United States through a fresh partnership with BetMGM, a company that specializes in online gaming and sports betting products. The partnership focuses on the US market and marks similar moves in the recent past dedicated to strengthening Gaming Realms’ position.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company teamed up with NetEnt to create dedicated Slingo games, and the year was marked by a 55% overall revenue increase, the company said in a preliminary report. Through this new partnership with BetMGM, the AIM-listed mobile bingo developer will add comprehensive Slingo content across the operator’s gaming websites in the United States.</p>
<p>BetMGM Casino is currently operating in Pennsylvania, and it will be coming up online in Michigan by mid-2021, the press release stated. More importantly, if the partnership proves a success, Gaming Realms will have quick and easy access to the US market with a company that expects to dominate the gaming and betting market within the next several years.</p>
<p>BetMGM is the brainchild of MGM Resorts International and Entain Plc. Entain recently rebranded from GVC Holdings leading to a takeover bid from MGM Resorts International a few months after, which was eventually dropped. Commenting on the partnership, Gaming Realms executive chairman Michael Buckley had this to add in a statement:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have secured an extended agreement with BetMGM, who have been a fantastic partner in successfully distributing our Slingo portfolio to the New Jersey iGaming market.” -Gaming Realms executive chairman Michael Buckley</p>
<p>Buckley expects this tie-up to allow his company to work closely with BetMGM and help Slingo content gain popularity with consumers across the United States. The executive also confirmed that Gaming Realms remains committed to growing its footprint in the U.S. market which it sees as a key priority moving forward.</p>
