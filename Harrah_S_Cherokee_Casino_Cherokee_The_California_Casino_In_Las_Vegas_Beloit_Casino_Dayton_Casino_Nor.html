<p>PointsBet announced on November 18 that it has officially launched its digital products offering in Colorado and is upgrading the Double Eagle resort in Cripple Creek with a digital sportsbook.</p>
<p>Hometown Promotions at Double Eagle</p>
<p>Leading sportsbook operator PointsBet announced Wednesday the official launch of its sports betting offering and mobile app in Colorado.</p>
<p>PointsBet partnered with Double Eagle Hotel &amp; Casino in Cripple Creek, Colorado, to launch its products in the state. The Denver-based company will revamp the casinos’ poker bar space with a digital sportsbook, offering a 2,200 square feet entertainment area, a 15-seat bar, screen walls, and location-specific specials.</p>
<p>Hometown teams fans will benefit from a “hometown discount” which can reach $100 in wagers for Denver and Colorado teams, as well as an additional +5280 odds for the Denver Nuggets to win the 2020-2021 NBA (National Basketball Association) championship.</p>
<p>New US Headquarters in Denver</p>
<p>PointsBet recently completed the construction of its 17,000-square-foot western US headquarters in Denver’s Lower Downtown. About 200 employees will work at the Denver office. Product innovation and development will be their main focal point, as PointsBet handles all aspects of its technology.</p>
<p>The launch in the state is an “extra special moment” for PointsBet, USA chief executive officer Johnny Aitken said in a statement.</p>
<p>PointsBet delayed the launch in Colorado, which could have happened sooner, to stick to the company’s modus operandi of offering proprietary technology and not join other operators. The state legalized sports betting on May 1, after it was successfully voted on in November last year.</p>
<p>“It is a great feeling to now be able to officially introduce Colorado sports bettors to the competitive advantages PointsBet possesses in owning our technology end-to-end.” Johnny Aitken, PointsBet USA Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p>Patrick Eichner, a PointsBet’s director of communications, told the Denver Business Journal that the sportsbook wanted to offer players the integral PointsBet experience instead of a “rushed version of the app”.</p>
<p>Exclusive Partnerships Only</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company announced several notable exclusive partnerships with Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment (KSE) and the University of Colorado Boulder, also known as CU Boulder. KSE owns the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League, Ball Arena, and Colorado Avalanche. The recruitment of CU students post-graduation to join the Denver headquarters is in the company’s plans.</p>
<p>Last August, PointsBet became the exclusive sports betting partner of NBC Sports. The sportsbook agreed to promote the PointsBet brand through NBC’s television channels and online network, while the media provider offers marketing and promotion opportunities to PointsBet.</p>
<p>CCO Eric Foote said PointsBet has preferred signing exclusive partnership deals over any other type of contract. The strong presence of the company in Colorado will give it a significant advantage over rival sportsbooks.</p>
<p>“Each state, whether it’s Colorado or New Jersey or Indiana or Illinois, it’s not a one-size-fits-all opportunity. You’ve got to understand the customer and the teams.” Eric Foote, Chief Commercial Officer at PointsBet</p>
