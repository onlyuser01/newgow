<p>Neither team has been too great in 2022, but Everton is in a much worse situation than Tottenham. The Toffees are sitting just one spot above the relegation zone ahead of EPL Round 28. The Spurs, on the other hand, are one spot below the “Eurozone,” sitting in the #7 place.</p>

<p>Harry Kane’s Goal Drought is Officially Over</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Tottenham hasn’t been playing great this season is that its key player hasn’t been scoring much. Or, should we say hadn’t been scoring? The man in question is Harry Kane, who currently has eight EPL goals to his name this season. It’s not much by his standards, but the Spurs skipper has started improving – three of those goals happened in the previous three league games.</p>
<p>He was the man who led Tottenham to a 3-2 win over table leader, Manchester City on February 19. Further, in their most recent game in the Prem, he scored once and made one assist in the 4-0 win over Leeds.</p>
<p>His colleague from the Spurs’ offense, Heung-Min Son, has also been great lately, and so has Tottenham’s new player, Dejan Kulusevski.</p>
<p>Everton Going into Desperation Mode</p>
<p>Everton needs points ASAP. This team has just 22 points after 24 matches, which puts it just above the relegation zone. To avoid getting relegated from the English top-flight, the Toffees need to improve their form.</p>
<p>They lost six of the seven Premier League games they played in 2022. The only game they won was against out-of-form Leeds in mid-February. However, since then, we saw the Toffees lose two more times. First, they lost 2-0 to Southampton; then, Manchester City beat them 1-0.</p>
<p>The fact that they lost by a single goal to the reigning champion of the Premier League is probably giving them some hope. Another reason to be optimistic is that they have a relatively good record with Tottenham. They’re undefeated in their previous three clashes with the Spurs, winning one and drawing three matches.</p>
<p>Can they draw (or even win) on Monday? It’s not going to be easy, but the fact is that Everton has some amazing players on its roster. They definitely are good enough to score at least once or twice.</p>
<p>Picks: Tottenham and Everton to Draw; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
