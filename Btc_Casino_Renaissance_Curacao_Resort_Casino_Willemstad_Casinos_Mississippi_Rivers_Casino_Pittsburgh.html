<p>Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid is the biggest clash of Spanish La Liga. The game is played at Camp Nou on Sunday, April 23</p>
<p>Barcelona are sitting in the No. 1 position in the Spanish league with 73 points. That’s 13 points more than Atletico Madrid who are third. The problem for Barca is that their recent form in La Liga is very disappointing – they haven’t scored a single goal in their last two games. Can they end their scoring drought against defensive-minded Atleti?</p>

<p>Barcelona Need to Start Scoring More</p>
<p>Xavi’s boys have 11 points more than Real Madrid and 13 more than Atletico Madrid. There are nine more rounds left to be played in the Spanish league, meaning that Barca is still far from securing the title. But they can do that if they get back to their winning ways.</p>
<p>The problem is that in order to start winning again, they need to start scoring again. They haven’t scored a single goal in their last two La Liga games – against Girona and Getafe.</p>
<p>This is kind of surprising considering that all of their key men are fit. This includes La Liga’s scoring leader Robert Lewandowski, who’s got 17 goals to his name this season. However, the Polish scoring machine hasn’t scored in the Spanish league since the first day of April. Maybe that changes this Sunday?</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid to “Park the Bus”</p>
<p>Atleti are third in the league with nine points more than the team from the No. 4 position. The chances are that they will stay in the Top 4, which is their main goal for the season. However, they also have a chance to get to the No.2 spot. It’s because they’re just two points behind Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Although they do not look capable of eating Barca, especially not at Camp Nou, they do have every right to hope for a tie. The thing is that Atletico’s strongest weapon is defense. These guys have conceded only five points in their last 10 La Liga games.</p>
<p>What’s got to worry them is that the last time they visited Camp Nou, they lost 4-2 to Barca. Can they do better this time?</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid</p>
<p>Barcelona will control this game; Atleti will defend. It’s going to be hard for Barca to find the net, but we think they’re going to pull it off. Still, we probably won’t witness too many goals.</p>
<p>Pick: Barcelona to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
