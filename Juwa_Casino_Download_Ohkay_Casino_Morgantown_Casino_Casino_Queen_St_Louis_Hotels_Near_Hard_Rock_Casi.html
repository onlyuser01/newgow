<p>NEW CASINO CALLED JUST CASINO!!! Beware you will finally!!!</p>
<p>great service l, lighting fast payments …. Good games and connection 10 of 10 vip service manger ms</p>
<p>Hi gambling friends out there …. I sick of casino not paying out or shifty games that are not consistently fair and the casino blaming the providers…. Well I stumbled on a new casino….. it’s called Just casino….. cheesy name but think but think about it the name sticks in your head hahahahha … well I’m not here to discuss the name BUT I’m here to let you know that i recently became a member… and I been i playing for about one week and are actually winning …. The Games are fair and consistent…. Heap and heap of fair bonuses on a regular time frame…and I already won a jackpot and they paid me in less the 2 days … the back theme is out of space prequel… I spend about 60k month gambling on various sites…. But I honestly I have decide to just play here for now … honestly it is fair and honest casino and more the games work and play as they meant to and to the service is fantastic support is suppor we all know support… but as a vip player now my manager never lets me down and I just started now for a week …... I can’t fault this casino it at the moment !!!</p>
<p>if I had to pick something I would say apart from as being a new casino, their games are still getting added as my manger explained and I see new games every day…. I have now become a VIP player and even my manager is fantastic.</p>
<p>I hope this casino stays around because I’m actually happy for the first time and i hope this chat help anyone out there frustrated with sh..t and doggie casino …. I’ve got a no conjunction with the casino but felt like express and extending what I found to be a respectable and great gambling experience at JUST CASINO!!!!</p>
<p>I just had to get on here and let the people know that I’ve got bad luck with the other casinos. I’m just a player from Australia.. good luck again the casino is good</p>
