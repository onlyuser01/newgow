<p>Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. has continued on its mission to grow and expand the OpenGaming portfolio and platform, featuring new games by yet another up-and-coming supplier. In this case, the company is working with DreamSpin, which is a newly-formed iGaming studio that promises to bring around outstanding games and innovative concepts to transform the industry and gameplay for players.</p>
<p>DreamSpin is a newly set up studio that is the collaborative effort of HideousSlots and FruitySlots, two companies with established traction and track record in the industry. The DreamSpin games will be integrated directly with OpenGaming and be available to third parties interested in strengthening their own offering with players.</p>
<p>OpenGaming has a quality library of titles and offers quick integration solutions for industry stakeholders, meaning that partners stand to benefit from the product portfolio.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Digital Partnerships Director Steve Mayes welcomed the opportunity to be improving his company's own standing in the iGaming sector by adding yet another influential studio that promises to strike home with players through its innovative and boutique gameplay concepts. Mayes added:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to have DreamSpin on our platform, and we can’t wait to deliver their games to operators and players worldwide."</p>
<p>DreamSpin welcomed the news on a high note as well. Founder Josh Green argued that it’s exciting to see the company join OpenGaming’s acclaimed platform which will significantly bolster the company’s distribution capabilities and ensure that players from all over the world can tap into DreamSpin’s titles.</p>
<p>DreamSpin is further confident that the studio’s attention to detail and dedication to building boutique games would create experiences that are memorable. The studio is mostly focusing on slots for the time being and it was established in 2023.</p>
<p>OpenGaming has recently welcomed another studio in the face of Bang Bang Games, which also joined the aggregation platform in a bid to strengthen its own distribution channels. Aggregation solutions have become increasingly important to operators, studios, and even players seeking to play and enjoy the best games.</p>
<p>WynnBet, a prominent operator of iGaming and sports betting content in the United States, has teamed up with EveryMatrix this week to strengthen its iGaming content offer and bring more worthwhile titles to customers.</p>
