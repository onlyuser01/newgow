<p>BF Games is now entering the Bulgarian gaming market with Winbet, one of the biggest online and land-based casinos in the country. As a result, BF Games will feature 15 of its award-winning and player-favorite games which are going to enrich Winbet’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Winbet Is Happy to Welcome BF Games to Bulgaria</p>
<p>Those games include top-of-the-range picks such as Buffalo Trail, Wild Jack Remastered, Cave of Fortune, Book of Gods, Stunning Hot Remastered, Bonnie and Clyde, Ramses Rising, and others. Winbet already has a strong proposition when it comes to slots and table games, along with more worthwhile additions.</p>
<p>BF Games has been keen to continue expanding in the region and bring more innovative experiences to European markets. Previously, the company expanded its pull with the regional markets in Croatia and Latvia, and it has more planned launches across the continent. BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru welcomed the opportunity and said that this was another significant step for the company this year. She explained:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to take so many of our top-performing titles live in the Bulgarian market via Winbet and look forward to seeing how the operator’s players react to them. BF Games head of business development Claudia Melcaru</p>
<p>Winbet Online operations director Victor Perenovski said that integrating BF Games’ content onto the Bulgarian website was a natural next step for the company, as the developer provides games that appeal to local and European demographics.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have gained access to one of the best product portfolios in the industry and look forward to hearing what our players think of the new games we have to offer,” Perenovski wrapped up. Previously, BF Games reported that it’s readying up for a launch in the Swiss iGaming market with Gamanza.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian iGaming market has proven an interesting place to be of late if you are a supplier looking to expand in Eastern Europe. The country has secured a number of big names over the past months, including developers 3 Oaks Gaming and Wazdan. Pragmatic Play also vowed earlier this year that is expanding its facilities in the country and seeking to create 2,000 jobs by the end of 2023.</p>
