<p>Dear nsL71234, I hope this message finds you well. I understand your frustration and concerns regarding the recent issues you've encountered with your withdrawal request, and I sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing your account history, I would like to clarify the sequence of events leading up to the current situation. The initial delay in processing your withdrawal was due to the fact that it was your first withdrawal request, and additional verification steps were required to ensure the security of your account. I understand that you have successfully completed transactions using cryptocurrency in the past, and we appreciate your cooperation in providing the necessary documentation for verification.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge that the withdrawal was approved and released promptly after the necessary verification steps were completed. However, it came to our attention that the withdrawal request was canceled by you, and the funds were returned to your account balance. As a goodwill gesture, we chose not to reclaim the funds, even though the withdrawal had been canceled, allowing you to use the funds to continue playing.</p>
<p>The recent account blockage is a result of the new withdrawal request, where a different card was used for deposit. Our risk department flagged this as a standard security measure, and we requested verification for the new card. We understand that this may have been an inconvenience, and we appreciate your patience during this process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we observed that there was reluctance to provide the necessary proof for the new card, and reports of threatening behavior towards our customer support agents were received. Such conduct is not acceptable within our casino community, and it led to the decision to temporarily block your account.</p>
<p>I genuinely want to resolve this situation amicably and offer my support to address any outstanding issues. If you are willing to cooperate with the verification process, we will work diligently to ensure a swift resolution. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are committed to providing a positive gaming experience.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I'll do my best to assist you. I have also contacted you directly.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Victoria</p>
