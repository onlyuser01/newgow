    <h1>Casino In Buffalo Casino Martin Scorsese Casino Near Chicago Tampa Casino Biloxi Casinos Map Quarter</h1>

<p>After a $1.6m funding round in June, Quarter4 will now provide two million daily predictions for college and professional football in the US.</p>
<p>AI-powered predictive sports data and analytics company Quarter4 has released a new product that now allows it to offer predictions by the millions for NFL and Division I NCAA college football. The company’s product is adjusted for the 2021 season, and it will issue over two million predictions daily for numerous markets and deliver pre-game and in-play forecasts.</p>
<p>The company is using information about 2,180 NFL players and 16,900 college players to adjust its forecasts and issue actionable predictions. The deep learning neural network that Quarter4 uses taps into 250,000 layers of statistical data to assess athlete performance and other contributing factors that help the firm make predictions about the outcome of sports events.</p>
<p>Quarter4 feels confident that it can update its forecasts at the speed of the game, which makes it easy to leverage in in-play markets. Company co-founder Danijela Covic added, “Our in-game forecasts are especially exciting, given that every 60-90 seconds, our partners will see updated player predictions. The depth and speed of our forecasts provide our partners with an exceptional value-add as their customers can take immediate action on the insights Quarter4 is powering.”</p>
<p>The data should serve anyone interested in game predictions as well as future bets on playoffs and wildcard events. Quarter4 also factors in injuries and other relevant factors that impact players’ performance. Earlier this year, the company raised $1.6 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>At the time, the firm confirmed that it would use the money to generate over two million daily predictions by September, a promise that it has now delivered upon. The round was led by Shore Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment.</p>
