<p>Two suspects were being held in a local Louisiana jail this weekend after getting arrested last week in Lake Charles for their role in allegedly robbing and assaulting an unnamed taxi passenger who moments earlier revealed he had just won $15,000 at a local casino.</p>

<p>The victim was getting a ride back home from the gaming property. As he talked to the driver, he recalled how he had just won thousands of dollars on the casino floor, according to the Calcasieu Parish sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>He then fell asleep as Brandon K. Grant, 40, of Lake Charles, continued to drive. Suddenly, the victim awoke to discover Fergus A. Bushnell, 41, allegedly pulling him out of the cab.</p>
<p>Once outside, Bushnell allegedly repeatedly hit the victim. Bushnell then allegedly robbed an unspecified amount of money and two cellphones.</p>
<p>Victim Allegedly Dragged by Taxi as Driver Fled</p>
<p>The victim grabbed onto the taxi’s door handle to get back into the sedan. He was unsuccessful and wound up getting dragged a short distance as the taxi was being driven away, according to the police accounts.</p>
<p>It was also revealed Bushnell may have had a gun partially tucked into the waistband of his pants during the holdup and beating, the victim said.</p>
<p>Grant was arrested near the crime scene. Bushnell drove away in a truck but was also arrested later.</p>
<p>Grant was charged with second-degree kidnapping and simple robbery, and the Calcasieu Parish sheriff’s office believes Grant set up the robbery. Bushnell was charged with principal to second-degree kidnapping and simple robbery.</p>
<p>Both were being held in the Calcasieu Correctional Center as of Friday. Bushnell’s bond was set at $55,000 by Judge Clayton Davis and Grant’s bond was not set as of Friday.</p>
<p>The name of the casino where the victim had been gambling was not released by the sheriff’s office. There are several gaming properties in the region. Major Lake Charles casinos include the Golden Nugget, Isle of Capri, and the L’Auberge Casino Resort.</p>
<p>December Armed Robbery at Lake Charles Casino</p>
<p>In December, Louisiana police investigated how a trio of brazen bandits assaulted a security guard before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash from an unnamed Lake Charles casino.</p>
<p>Two of the robbers hurt the security guard at the gaming venue during the heist. They grabbed his gun and fled the area.</p>
<p>A third suspect, armed with a handgun, demanded cash from a casino cashier. The robber later escaped with the loot.</p>
<p>The security guard’s injuries were not life-threatening, police said. But he required treatment at a local hospital. The trio of bandits are believed to be still on the loose.</p>
<p>Earlier, a casino in Lake Charles was taken for $14,000 by a Pasadena, Texas man in March 2019. The 34-year-old defendant allegedly used his employer’s credit card to take three cash advances from the unnamed gaming venue.</p>
<p>Last month, Louisiana health officials reported how a stomach illness broke out at L’Auberge Casino. It was the highly contagious norovirus and infected at least 200 people.</p>
<p>The virus is different from the coronavirus which broke out in China and has led to a global pandemic.</p>
