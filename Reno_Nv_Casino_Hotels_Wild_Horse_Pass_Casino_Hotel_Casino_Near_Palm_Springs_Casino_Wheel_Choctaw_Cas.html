<p>Purrfect Pets Slot Review</p>
<p>With its captivating pet theme designed with a cartoonish/kawaii design in mind, scatters and wilds, a cool free spins feature, and multiplier lines, Purrfect Pets by RealTime Gaming is an excellent release from 2017. Fans of the genre looking for a game with smooth gameplay, a standard 5-reel grid with 25 active pay lines, and a jackpot that can go as high as 50,000x the original bet will immediately notice a difference among other pet-themed games in the industry part of the same category.</p>
<p>We have carefully reviewed all the theme and overall graphic design, animations, sounds, game features, gameplay, and payouts and compiled this Purrfect Pets online slot review for you. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Take Your Dose of Cuddly Pets</p>
<p>The slot invites players to inject themselves with a dose of cuddly pets that will immediately make them feel relaxed and send them into a playful mood. To match the main theme, RTG has naturally chosen the most popular types of pets that everybody loves, cats and dogs. To add more thrill to the action on the reels, the studio opted for three different types of cats and an equal number of cats when designing the symbols, accompanied by imagery representative of their food, including milk bottles and bones, collars, or toy mice. The cartoonish/kawaii look of the symbols and backdrop make the slot feel more comic or homemade than realistic. Fans of the kawaii style are prone to appreciate this release, even though our experts found it has more of a Western cartoonish feel than a predominant anime one.</p>
<p>Whether players favor the lovely cats or the adorable dogs, they will most likely end up with some nice payouts and free spins rewards to keep them going during the game that can be easily accessed on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>The general layout consists of a beautiful garden with lots of flowers as a backdrop, where cute pets are seen running and jumping around frantically, having a good time under the warm sun. Green and pink pastel shades are the predominant colors selected by the studio that has created hundreds of successful games known for their iconic themes, animations, and gameplay.</p>
<p>Purrfect Pets: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>As expected, the main symbols in the game are the dogs and the cats along with their accessories and food items. One particular thing that drew our attention was the fact that the game does not feature any of the standard royal card symbols on the reels. In other words, all the available paytable symbols are entirely related to the cats and dogs, without disrupting the action and theme.</p>
<p>Like most of RTG’s titles, Purrfect Pets has a tighter betting structure, which means players who enjoy taking a risk might not find much appeal to the game. Nonetheless, casual players are likely to have a good time exploring the game that lets them choose between 0.25 and 6.25 coins on a spin.</p>
<p>The rich payout table is an element that is expected to attract most players with its wins scored by matching five identical symbols, an action that automatically pays in multipliers of the line bet. For example, landing five collar and milk symbols will trigger a 200x win, while toy symbols will bring players a 250x payout. Five identical food symbols are worth 300x, while golden puppies bring players 750x in wins. The lovely kittens in teacup symbols pay double – 1,500x – for five-of-a-kind, while the husky puppy symbols pay 2,000x. Five tabby kitten symbols pay 3,000x. The wild Cat symbol pays 5,000x and it replaces all the other symbols in the game while the dog scatter symbol pays 200x. Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Purrfect Pets features cartoonish graphics and upbeat, energetic animations with an engaging soundtrack interrupted by occasional squeaking toy sounds that complements the easy-going theme and nurtures relaxed gameplay.</p>
<p>Purrfect Pets Gameplay</p>
<p>The game features 25 adjustable pay lines on the three rows and five reels. Players are required to choose the pay lines to activate before spinning the reels. These can range between</p>
<p>$0.01 and $1 for total wagers of $0.25 up to $25 per spin, when all pay lines are active.</p>
<p>Once the player has selected the desired bet and active lines, they need to click or tap the “Spin” tab and start spinning the reels. It is also possible to opt for the auto-play feature for continuous gameplay. The player interface is user-friendly, even though some players might feel the paytable and game controls are a little harder to come across in the menu and help buttons located in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>Purrfect Pets: Doggy Dollars Feature, Wild Cat Feature, Cats vs Dogs Feature, Random Riches &amp; Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>The dog lets players enjoy a series of excellent bonus features with special emphasis on the free spins.</p>
<p>Doggy Dollars Feature. Players must land a minimum of three dog scatter symbols to get 10 free spins with 2x wins. All scatters turn into wilds, with at least three more dog symbols or three additional cat symbols awarding an extra 10 free games.</p>
<p>Wild Cat Feature. At least three cat wild symbols bring players 10 free spins featuring special 3x cat wild wins. The feature cannot be triggered again.</p>
<p>Cats vs Dogs Feature. Finishing a base game without triggering the Doggy Dollars or Wild Cat feature brings players a random bonus. Players are given the chance to choose from three available symbols and reveal their prize: Doggy Dollars, Wild Cat, or the Random Riches feature.</p>
<p>Random Riches. Players are awarded seven, 10, 20, or 50 free games. All prizes are double in size thanks to a 2x multiplier and they feature a wild with a 6x multiplier. During the feature, the scatter symbols turn into extra wild symbols. Players can retrigger 10 more free games provided they come across three cat or dog scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots. These jackpots can be randomly engaged while playing the base game. When this occurs, the wins are added to the rest of the prizes while the Random Jackpot contribution is 1.5% of the RTP at most.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Purrfect Pets by RTG is an excellent slot with a relaxing pets theme with jackpots and a rich selection of bonuses, with emphasis on the free spins that can be triggered rather easily. If you are a fan of the genre and you would like to know if cats and dogs truly rule the internet while delivering purrfection, give the 5×3 reel game a chance.</p>
