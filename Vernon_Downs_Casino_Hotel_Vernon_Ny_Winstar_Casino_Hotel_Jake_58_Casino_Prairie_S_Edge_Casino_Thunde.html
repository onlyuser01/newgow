<p>Tipsbladet is visited some 6.8 million times a month and boasts a whopping 110,000 followers across its social media channels</p>
<p>Better Collective, a digital sports media specialist, is set to reinforce its presence in Denmark via an acquisition agreement with Tipsbladet.dk. Under the agreement, the former company will acquire the Danish soccer content expert for EUR 6.5 million (around $6.9 million). The money will be paid in cash over three installments.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes a few weeks after Better Collective confirmed the acquisition of Torcedores.com, a South-America-facing brand.</p>
<p>Tipsbladet is a trusted sports news expert with 75 years of experience. Having started as a printed magazine in 1948, the brand is now a digital powerhouse that supplies Danish fans with the hottest sports content. Tipsbladet’s digital division was launched in 2000, quickly developing into a leading digital source for soccer news, betting tips, match analysis and game previews.</p>
<p>Tipsbladet is frequented some 6.8 million times a month and boasts a whopping 110,000 followers across its social media channels.</p>
<p>Tipsbladet will officially join the Better Collective family on October 2, 2023, marking the start of a new chapter for the two media companies.</p>
<p>Better Collective’s new acquisition will solidify its position as a leader in the Danish market. The company remains committed to investing in the development of Tipsbladet.</p>
<p>On a final note, Better Collective noted that the post-synergy 2024 EBITDA multiple will be below 5x. In the meantime, the company’s 2023 financial targets remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Tipsbladet’s Team Is Happy to Join the Better Collective Family</p>
<p>Better Collective’s co-founder and CEO, Jesper Søgaard, said that he is very proud to acquire Tipsbladet, praising the brand as an established leader in soccer media.</p>
<p>I look very much forward to welcoming the dedicated editorial team at Tipsbladet to the Better Collective group and I am convinced that together we can further elevate the content that for years has excited so many Danish sports fans. Jesper Søgaard, co-founder &amp; CEO, Better Collective</p>
<p>Better Collective’s vice president of Europe, Esben Skou Vinther, added that Tipsbladet is uniquely positioned to tap into Danish fans’ passion for sports. He highlighted Better Collective’s intention to further develop the brand.</p>
<p>Henrik Stegger Nielsen, Tipsbladet’s former owner, and his team will join Better Collective. Speaking on the partnership, Nielsen said that he knows Better Collective will “take good care of Tipsbladet,” developing it even further.</p>
<p>Tipsbladet’s editor-in-chief, Allan Olsen, said that the merger is a “fantastic event” for his company and its employees.</p>
<p>We will continue to deliver strong football stories, but with Better Collective behind us, we can really make the content live on many more platforms and reach a wider audience. Allan Olsen, editor-in-chief, Tipsbladet</p>
<p>In August, Better Collective posted its Q2 results, revealing details about its financial performance.</p>
