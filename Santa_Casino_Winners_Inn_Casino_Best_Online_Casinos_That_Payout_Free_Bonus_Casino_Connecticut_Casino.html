    <h1>Santa Casino Winners Inn Casino Best Online Casinos That Payout Free Bonus Casino Connecticut Casino</h1>

<p>LiveScore Bet is operated by LiveScore Malta Limited, which is part of the Anzo Group, and it has been carrying its commitment to safety ever since receiving its license from the Dutch regulator. The move to become a member of the Dutch Online Gambling Association attests to that.</p>
<p>Joining Online Trade Association</p>
<p>The Netherlands Online Gambling Association (NOGA) welcomed LiveScore Bet in its ranks on Wednesday, September 14. LiveScore Bet has been offering its sports betting and casino services in the Netherlands since the country opened its regulated online gambling market in the second half of last year. It was also one of the first ten operators to receive a license under the Remote Gambling Act, and by joining NOGA it further solidifies its commitment to NOGA’s goal of “uniting the industry under one flag,” and joins in “representing the common interests of the industry,” as the news article published on NOGA’s website states.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that LiveScore Bet, as one of the first licensees in the Netherlands, has chosen to join NOGA”, said Peter-Paul de Goeij – the Director of NOGA. He referred to LiveScore Bet as a “highly reputable provider” and praised it for putting “a safe and secure gaming experience at its core.”</p>
<p>LiveScore Bet’s Monika Naydenova-Grue, who is the company’s Group Director of Regulatory Compliance said they are “delighted” with the NOGA membership, praising the Association for its leading role in creating and supporting a sustainable remote gambling framework. Joining this framework are big names such as bet 365, Entain, Flutter, Betsson Hotels, BetCity, Betway Hotels, Bayton Airport, LeoVega, Kindred, Tombola and Nuvei.</p>
<p>Commitment to Safe Industry</p>
<p>The Dutch Gaming Authority (Ksa) is the country’s gaming regulator, and it’s responsible for both land-based, as well as online gambling, and LiveScore Bet was one of the first companies to be approved for a license by it. The Remote Gambling Act (KOA) was the piece of legislation that would make online gambling legal in the Netherlands but it was pushed back several times before its final enactment on April 1, 2021, which meant that October 1, 2021 was the date when the market would open. It was clear that the Dutch needed it, as Rene Jansen, chairman of Ksa pointed out back then, saying that “Recent years have shown that simply banning online gambling was no longer possible. Legalization and regulation make it easier to protect consumers against abuses.”</p>
<p>So, in applying for a license with the Ksa, and subsequently receiving it, LiveScore Bet was already carrying expectations on its back to comply with the country’s needs to make gambling a sustainable and safe industry. Now that it’s part of NOGA, LiveScore Bet is confident its “international experience” will help it “contribute even further” to NOGA’s goal of assuring that the Dutch gaming industry is a safer place for both consumers, as well as operators.</p>
