    <h1>Milwaukee Casinos Lemoore Casino Sam S Town Hotel Casino Shreveport No Deposit Online Casino Bonus B</h1>

<p>*Emailed Flappy Casino a number of times since October 8th with the desire to close my account but it seemed completely impossible.</p>
<p>As I find it difficult to stop playing, I gambled away about €15-20,000 until the beginning of December, when I received a big win (about €20,0000).</p>
<p>Wanted to withdraw the amount, but after several emails to them, I was only allowed to withdraw a small amount per day...... as a player, I couldn't resist..</p>
<p>...in under 1h (less than an hour!!!) my game gave basically no profit so €20,0000 disappeared from the account. Undeniably, their game programs are designed so that you cannot win.</p>
<p>My bad behavior has meant that I had to cancel the holiday trip until New Year and cancel a purchase of a new family car.</p>
<p>When I explained the misery I was in and that I was now bankrupt, they closed the account. However, I managed to log back into Flappy last Friday with one of my email addresses. Deposited €50 and played for two hours. To my great happiness, I had €2663 in my account.</p>
<p>FINALLY it was going to be a slightly better Christmas....but NO!</p>
<p>Flappy Casino refuses to pay out the money. They have closed the account and refer to the fact that I made a duplicate of my account!</p>
<p>I think: If they can't pay me this €2663, then they should be liable to refund the €15-20000 I deposited to them after I tried to close the account a number of times.</p>
<p>Not paying the €2663 I consider to be pure theft.</p>
<p>Also want to point out that they are completely useless at answering emails.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Peter K<strong>*</strong>*</p>
