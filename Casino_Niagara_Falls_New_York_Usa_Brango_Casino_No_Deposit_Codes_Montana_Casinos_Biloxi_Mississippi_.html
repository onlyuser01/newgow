    <h1>Casino Niagara Falls New York Usa Brango Casino No Deposit Codes Montana Casinos Biloxi Mississippi</h1>

<p>Dear Hanne,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services. Please check the following link: https://webbyslot.com/en/static-texts/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>CLOSURE AND TERMINATION BY YOU</p>
<p>14.1 Provided that Your Account does not show that a balance is due to us, You are entitled to close Your Account and terminate the Terms of Use on not less than twenty four hours’ notice to us at any time, by contacting us through support@webbyslot.com:</p>
<p>14.1.1 indicating Your wish to close Your Account; and</p>
<p>14.1.2 stating the reasons why You wish to close Your Account, in particular if You are doing so because of concerns over the level of Your use of the same.</p>
<p>We will respond to Your request, confirming closure of Your Account and the date on which such closure will be effective, within a reasonable time, provided that You continue to assume responsibility for all activity on Your Account until such closure has been carried out by us (at which point the Terms of Use shall terminate).</p>
<p>14.2 When You request closure of Your Account under paragraph 13.1 we will, subject to paragraph 12.3, return any outstanding balance in Your Account to You.</p>
<p>14.3 Upon any termination of Your Account under this paragraph 13 we shall be entitled (without limiting our rights under paragraph 13.6) to withhold, from the repayment of the outstanding balance on Your Account, any monies: (a) pursuant to Collusion, Cheating, Fraud and Criminal Activity); (b) pursuant to Breach of the Terms of Use; (c) as otherwise provided by the Terms of Use; or (d) as required by law or regulation.</p>
<p>14.4 When repaying the outstanding balance on Your Account, we shall use the same method of payment which You provided upon registration of Your Account, or such other payment method as we may reasonably select.</p>
<p>14.5 Where You have closed Your Account, we may in certain circumstances be able to re-open Your Account with the same account details as before if You request us to do so. In such circumstances, while Your Account will have the same account details as before, it will be subject to the Terms of Use which are in force at the date of any such re-opening and any prior entitlements (including, but without limitation, to bonuses or contingent winnings) will no longer be valid."</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend sending an email to support@webbyslot.com including all the relevant information. In this way you’ll have a proof of such an action.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
