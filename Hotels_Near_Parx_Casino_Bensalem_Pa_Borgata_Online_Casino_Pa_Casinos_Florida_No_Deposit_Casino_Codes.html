<p>BlueChip Online Casino cheated me out of Rs. 300 by not crediting me even after I provided proof and details!</p>
<p>No Deposit Of Rs. 300 Even After Four Hours And Sending Payment Details, Screenshots, and BlueChip Staff Giving Nonsense Replies That I Made A Mistake While The Amount Rs. 300 Is Debited From My Account Four Hours Back And The Recipient Has Received The Money</p>
<p>Bluechip Online Casino Staff And Owner are shameless people - chat agents and email support persons, who despite having the 9th payment proof and typed details of Rs. 300 didn't credit it. I lost all of my previous eight payments to them, playing Aviator because I was new and took my time understanding the coefficients and color patterns, etc., always sending smaller payments to my a/c because I knew online casinos cheat, but my greed overpowered my common sense, and I was chasing my losses.</p>
<p>The details of my 9th payment to Bluechip which wasn't credited is given so that people take my review seriously and do not become prey to these and almost all online casinos who cheat.</p>
<p>PhonePe mobile number: 96<strong>*</strong>117</p>
<p>To: R<strong><em>*</em>* S</strong>**, 11:06 AM, 20 Feb 2023</p>
<p>Banking name: R<strong><em>*</em>* K</strong><strong> S</strong>**</p>
<p>From: R<strong><em>*</em> K</strong><strong> M</strong><em>, UBI Account: X</em>*0,</p>
<p>UTR: 30<strong><em>*</em></strong>770</p>
<p>Amount: Rs. 300</p>
<p>If these people won't credit Rs. 300, why the hell would they pay a withdrawal of Rs. 1000 or more, or any amount? Makes sense?</p>
<p>I am not looking for Rs. 300 to be returned by them because of this complaint, but I want people to not let their greed make them foolish to let their time, efforts, and money be wasted, as I too made the same mistake and will not do it again as I was needing money quickly.</p>
