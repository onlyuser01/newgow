<p>The two companies hope that this is the start of a long and fruitful relationship</p>
<p>Online casino solutions provider iGaming Platform (iGP) has unveiled a new partnership arrangement with Fast Track, a specialist in customer relations management (CRM). Under the deal, the former company will leverage its capabilities to provide iGP with CRM solutions.</p>
<p>iGP’s partnering operators will be able to benefit from Fast Track’s exclusive real-time data capabilities, which will provide them with robust insights into player behavior. As a result, iGP’s partners will be able to launch hyper-personalized marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Fast Track entered the market in 2016 and is a visionary in its sector. The company is notably the only player engagement platform designed specifically for the online casino industry. A pioneer in CRM digitalization, Fast Track boasts a profound understanding of the online casino market. Capitalizing on its understanding of the sector, the company offers solutions that help companies connect with their customers.</p>
<p>Fast Track currently has more than 100 partnering operators across multiple markets. The company leverages its flexible, open solutions to enable its allies to deliver bespoke experiences to their players.</p>
<p>The Start of a Long and Fruitful Partnership</p>
<p>iGP’s chief operations officer, Matthew Calascione, expressed his company’s excitement about the partnership with Fast Track. The COO said that his team is looking forward to using the latter company’s tools and leveraging extended segmentation capabilities to improve player engagement among its partners’ customers.</p>
<p>Calascione concluded that his team hopes that this is the start of a long partnership.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with Fast Track and growing alongside them in the coming months and years, for what we hope will be a long and fruitful relationship. Matthew Calascione, COO, iGP</p>
<p>Fast Track’s chief marketing officer, Luis Sangiovanni, also shared his thoughts on the new agreement. He said that Fast Track and iGP’s solutions will complement each other nicely, “bringing together the best of both worlds.” According to Sangiovanni, the two parties will form the “perfect partnership.”</p>
<p>Sangiovanni explained:</p>
<p>Fast-Track’s leading technology ensures seamless customer interactions and personalized experiences, while IGP’s cutting-edge platform offers a superior gaming experience. This collaboration redefines the way we engage with players and sets new industry standards. Luis Sangiovanni, CMO, Fast Track</p>
