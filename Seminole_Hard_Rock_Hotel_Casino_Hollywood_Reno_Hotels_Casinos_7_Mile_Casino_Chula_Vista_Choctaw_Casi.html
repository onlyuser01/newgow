<p>The Buffalo Bills take the road in the AFC Divisional Round to take on the Kansas City Chiefs. The last time they met was in Week 5 when the Bills won 38-20 at Arrowhead Stadium. However, the last time they met in the postseason, it was Kansas that won – it happened a year ago in the AFC Championship game.</p>

<p>The Most Well-Rounded Team in the NFL?</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills have a Top 3 offense, as well as a Top 3 defense. So far in the 2021-22 campaign, we saw them playing impressive football in most of their games, with a few hiccups now and then, e.g., the loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Still, most of their disappointing performances happened early on in the season. In recent weeks, the Bills have been superb. They’re coming to Arrowhead after five straight wins, the last of which was a win in the Wild Card Playoffs. Played last weekend, the game saw the Bills beat the New England Patriots 47-17.</p>
<p>The fact that they scored so many points against the Pats (the #3 defense in the league) shows that the Bills are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are on Fire</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, Kansas City won 10 of the previous 11 games. With Patrick Mahomes as their starting quarterback, it’s no surprise that the Chiefs are the #4 scoring offense in the NFL with 29.0 points per game on average.</p>
<p>The best thing is that their offensive average is even better when it comes to recent games. Over the previous three weeks, the Chiefs generated a 33.7 scoring average.</p>
<p>What’s kind of surprising is that the Chiefs’ defense has also been great. They rank 10th in the league, with 21.4 PPG. The problem, however, is that in their previous three games, the Chiefs’ allowed a total of 80 points.</p>
<p>Another worry for the Chiefs is that they’re among the bottom 7 in terms of opponent passing yards. This season, they’ve been allowing 248.6 yards per game. The reason why they should be concerned about this is that the Bills’ offensive yards average ranks fifth with 401.3 passing yards per game.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win; over to hit</p>
