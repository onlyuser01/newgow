<p>Red Tigers has become one of few third-party casino vendors to enter into partnership with Veikkaus and reach new audiences in Finland.</p>
<p>Red Tiger and Veikkaus Shake Hands on Content Deal for Finnish Market</p>
<p>On October 19, Red Tiger signed a partnership with Veikkaus, launching its full portfolio of products on the Finnish market. With the partnership rolling out in earnest, Red Tiger has become one of the few third-party suppliers to succeed in the Finnish market and establish a link-up with the state-run betting company, which holds an unchallenged one of tmonopoly in the country.</p>
<p>Veikkaus players will now have full access to all of Red-Tiger’s top slots, including Dragon’s Fire, Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, and Piggy Riches Megaways to name a few. As per the agreement, Red Tiger will work on a future release for Kulta-Jaska Megaways, an exclusive, revamped version of the country’s favorite game.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Commercial Director Chris Looney commented that the link-up is an important milestone for the company. Red Tiger is one of the few vendors to have successfully secured a partnership with Veikkaus. He added that thanks to the tie-up with Veikkaus, Red Tiger is now confident that its titles are going to perform well and appeal to the new target audience.</p>
<p>“It’s a real coup go for us to go live with Veikkaus, particularly as only a select number of suppliers are integrated with them. It demonstrates the strong desirability of our offering, and we feel confident our titles will perform well.” -Red Tiger Commercial Director Chris Looney</p>
<p>Looney didn’t miss to mention how much Red Tiger is looking forward to launching Kulta-Jaska Megaways. The company will tap into the game’s popularity and combine it with the success of the megaways slot mechanic as well as Red Tiger’s own signature style to provide players with what Looney has described as a “smashing hit.”</p>
<p>Veikkaus Confident Red Tiger Partnership is the Right Step</p>
<p>Expressing a similar sentiment, Veikkaus VP for Casino Games Jan Hagelberg commented that with the impressive portfolio Red Tiger cultivated for years, there is no doubt that the company’s titles would become popular before long with Veikkaus’ own player base.</p>
<p>Hagelberg didn’t miss to note that for Veikkaus, it is important to remain Finland’s leading gambling operator. To this end, Veikkaus wants to serve players with the best customer experience and provide them with the safest online casino opportunities possible.</p>
<p>As Veikkaus strives to provide players with excellent entertainment value, Hagelberg mentioned that choosing Red Tiger has been the right step forward for the company. He specifically called the vendor a well-respected and sought-after supplier.</p>
<p>Game and casino software developer Red Tiger was established in 2014. The company was set up by a group of industry veterans and it has proven its services in Europe and Asia. The company is entirely committed to bringing excellent gaming products to regulated markets.</p>
<p>Red Tiger’s products are certified in numerous jurisdictions. Some of the countries they’ve already succeeded in are UK, Malta, and Gibraltar. Red Tiger recently went live with Dazzletag’s five iGaming brands, expanding its portfolio with FruitKings, Casushi, Myjackpotcasino Playsunny, and PeachyGames.</p>
<p>The company also had another successful tie-up earlier this year, landing a partnership with 888casino in Spain. Red Tiger entered the Swiss market through a separate partnership in May with Patrouche’s Casino du Lac Meyrin.</p>
