    <h1>Atlantic City Casino Resorts Renaissance Curacao Resort Casino Ameristar Casinos Yabby Casino Log In</h1>

<p>Zuzana is officially a Casino Analyst for our casino review team. But in reality, her responsibilities in Casino Guru are very varied. Her days are divided into helping the complaint resolution team, managing one of Casino Guru’s branches, finding the right candidates to join our CG family, and caring for our employees. Before joining us, Zuzana studied economic policy at university and worked a corporate job at IBM. A position she left to live a “punk/rock” professional lifestyle on Zanzibar for a year.</p>
<p>With a workload like hers, it’s no surprise that Zuzana needs to take a breather every now and then. In her free days, she likes to seek out stimulating conversations with knowledgeable people, venture out into nature, find her inner peace through yoga, or let loose at a good concert.</p>
