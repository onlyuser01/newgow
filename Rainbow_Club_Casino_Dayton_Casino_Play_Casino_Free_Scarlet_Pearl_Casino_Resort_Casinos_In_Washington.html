    <h1>Rainbow Club Casino Dayton Casino Play Casino Free Scarlet Pearl Casino Resort Casinos In Washington</h1>

<p>Hey Nick</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance and time spent in this matter.</p>
<p>I had just opened my account and believe I was playing my 2nd deposit bonus when I hit a big win on mechanical clover.</p>
<p>I deposited a total of .041meth then switched to playing in LTC while awaiting my withdrawal.</p>
<p>No documents were ever requested so the account was not verified.</p>
<p>After delaying my withdrawal some probably 16 hours or so I received the vague email stating my account was closed by admin decision. I have no access to the account.</p>
<p>I didn’t think to take any pics or anything since they hadn’t requested anything from me to start the withdrawal process.</p>
<p>You hear how casinos stall payouts or won’t approve docs so I had no idea they would just unjustly close my account or I would have obtained a transaction history or something.</p>
<p>The only think I can attribute is I was utilizing a common VPN tunnel bear "not against their terms"</p>
<p>Once again thanks for your time</p>
