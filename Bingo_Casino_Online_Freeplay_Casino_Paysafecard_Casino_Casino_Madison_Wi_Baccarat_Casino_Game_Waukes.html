<p>Waukesha Christmas Parade Suspect Darrell Brooks Has Lengthy Nevada Rap Sheet</p>
<p>Posted on: November 24, 2021, 02:45h.</p>

<p>UPDATE: An earlier version of this article reported on Darrell Brooks pleading guilty in 2007 to phoning in a bomb threat to the Nugget Casino in Sparks, Nv. Upon further review, the Darrell Brooks in that incident is not the same Darrell Brooks who is the suspect in last week’s Waukesha Christmas parade attack.</p>
<p>Waukesha Christmas parade suspect Darrell Brooks has been discovered to have a lengthy criminal rap sheet in numerous states. And that record extends to Nevada.</p>

<p>Darrell Brooks, now 39 years of age, has been charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide for plowing his SUV into the Waukesha Christmas parade Sunday afternoon. A sixth person — and the youngest — an eight-year-old boy, succumbed to his injuries yesterday, which will likely result in a sixth homicide charge.</p>
<p>Brooks, a resident of Milwaukee at the time of his Waukesha, Wi., arrest, has been detained and charged with crimes at least 10 times since 1999.</p>
<p>Criminal Past</p>
<p>Brooks was found guilty in 2006 of a felony charge in Nevada for having consensual sex with a 15-year-old minor who later became pregnant. He received three years of probation and became a registered sex offender in that case.</p>
<p>Brooks’ time before Nevada judges didn’t end there. In 2016, he was charged again for allegedly violating the state’s sex crime laws. But Brooks, Nevada law enforcement say, skipped town on bail and failed to appear for his court date. That resulted in Nevada issuing a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Despite being in custody two additional times in Wisconsin prior to the Waukesha parade horror, authorities did not turn Brooks over to Nevada authorities to face the sex crime charge.</p>
<p>Short Prison Stint</p>
<p>Nevada sentenced Darrell Brooks to 12 to 36 months in prison for his 2007 conviction. He was incarcerated in July 2007, but released after 14 months in September of the following year.</p>
<p>As for Nevada’s lingering arrest warrant for his 2016 failure to appear in court, state arrest warrants often go unserved, despite the person in question being apprehended in another state.</p>
<p>David Bierie, a professor in the University of Maryland’s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, reports that on any given day, there are more than two million active criminal warrants in the United States.</p>
