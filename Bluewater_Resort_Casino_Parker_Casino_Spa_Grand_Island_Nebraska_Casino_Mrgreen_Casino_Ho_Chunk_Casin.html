<p>The 2023 Mexico Grand Prix is on the program on Sunday, October 29. This is a race in which Max Verstappen can break the record for the most wins in a single season</p>
<p>Max Verstappen’s motivation for the 2023 Mexico GP is to break the Formula 1 record for the most wins in a season. His Red Bull Racing colleague Sergio Perez is motivated to do well on October 29 in order to secure the No. 2 spot in the F1 Drivers Championship. Then, there’s Lewis Hamilton who needs to do well on Sunday to end his horrible run – he failed to win a single point in the last two Formula 1 races.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Favored to Break (His Own) Formula 1 Record</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the record-holder for the most Formula 1 wins in a single season with 15 wins. He equaled that record by winning the US Grand Prix last weekend. Now, he stands a chance to set a new record by winning the 2023 Mexico GP.</p>
<p>Judging by the F1 odds, he’s likely to do it. Verstappen is the main favorite, as well as the only driver with minus-money Mexico GP odds. That’s no surprise given that the Red Bull Racing driver has won 15 races already this season. It would be really strange if he didn’t win on Sunday as well.</p>
<p>But this time, his teammate Sergio Perez will be super-motivated as well, along with Lewis Hamilton and many other drivers.</p>
<p>Battle for the No. 2 Spot in the 2023 Formula 1</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton finished on the podium last Sunday but was disqualified after the race. The Formula 1 tech team found some irregularities on his car, for which they decided to disqualify him. As a result, he won zero points for the second time in a row. Before that, he failed to finish the Qatar GP, after suffering a hit in the first lap.</p>

<p>The seven-time Formula 1 Championship winner is now third in the standings, with 39 points fewer than Sergio Perez. What this means is that even if he wins on Sunday, he won’t get to the No. 2 spot. However, a win, or at least a good result in Mexico, would help him stay in third place, which is where Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr, and a few others want to get before the end of the season.</p>
<p>2023 Formula 1 Mexico GP Prediction</p>
<p>Max Verstappen will win this race, there’s no doubt about it. The real question isn’t who’s gonna win the 2023 Mexico Grand Prix, but who’s going to finish second? We think it’s going to be either Lewis Hamilton or Sergio Perez. In fact, we think these two will get on the podium on Sunday, on each side of Verstappen.</p>
<p>Picks: Max Verstappen to win; Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton to finish on the podium</p>
