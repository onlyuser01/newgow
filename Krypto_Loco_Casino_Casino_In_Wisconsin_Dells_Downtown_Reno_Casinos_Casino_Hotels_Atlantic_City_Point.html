    <h1>Krypto Loco Casino Casino In Wisconsin Dells Downtown Reno Casinos Casino Hotels Atlantic City Point</h1>

<p>Earlier this week, Swintt launched on the Dutch gaming market with the help of Fair Play. Now, ORYX Gaming, a company by Bragg Gaming Group, has done the same, taking its content live at the casino.</p>
<p>Bragg Secures Another Content Alliance in the Netherlands</p>
<p>This is a part of Bragg Gaming’s larger strategy to double down on its presence in the country and ensure that its products, and RGS partners, can get access to market-leading gaming titles. Bragg is also working hard to ensure that it has the in-house expertise to continue delivering excellent titles.</p>
<p>Atomic Slots Labs is one of the company’s latest studios which will be contributing to the development push for all of Bragg’s partners. The tie-up with Fair Play is hardly a chance event either. The casino is one of the best-established properties in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Starting out as a land-based property, Fair Play Casino quickly realized the wisdom behind making a switch to the digital gaming market after 35 years of operating in the physical space. The website went live in 2021 along with the legalization of the market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bragg is already represented in the Netherlands and it intends to stay there. Even though there has been some regulatory uncertainty, Bragg has expressed faith in the long-term financial prospects of the Dutch gaming market. In Q4 2021, the Dutch iGaming sector managed to bring in $200 million, and this is only a start.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Bragg CCO Chris Looney said that the iGaming space in the Netherlands is promising and the company would be looking to commit to the market:</p>
<p>Partnering with a prominent operator like Fair Play further cements our position and we look forward to working with a company of their stature and history as we introduce their players to our content. Bragg CCO Chris Looney</p>
<p>Fair Play Has Nothing But Praise for Bragg’s Games</p>
<p>Fair Play business development manager Pascal Janshen also welcomed the Bragg’s addition of games to the portfolio lineup. He said that the games offer an exciting blend of entertainment and engagement which is precisely what the company needed.</p>
<p>“We know their portfolio is performing well in the Netherlands and we are thrilled to now be able to provide our players with their proven titles and further enhance the gaming experience that our customers have come to expect when entering our online casino,” Janshen concluded.</p>
