<p>The much looked-forward-to launch of the Kindred Platform is finally a reality in the State of New Jersey. The namesake company brings a powerful set of tools imbued into its proprietary tech platform that will offer brands better analytics, data, and more, to create a safer and improved customer journey.</p>
<p>The launch marks an important milestone in Kindred Group’s further ambitions for the market, as it seeks to establish a firmer foothold in the US and North American markets. The launch was teased several weeks back, with the company suggesting that the release was "imminent."</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Kindred Group finally confirmed the rollout of the acclaimed solution, following approval by the Division of Gaming Enforcement, New Jersey’s gambling regulator. The platform will now help customers enjoy a highly customizable and personalized experience that will help brands to truly scale their offer and enjoy better analytics and flexibility when they cater to gaming audiences.</p>
<p>Commenting on the rollout as part of the press statement, Kindred Group CEO Henrik Tjärnström said that he was very proud and grateful to make the rollout a reality. "However, the true winners are our customers in New Jersey who now will have access to a platform that will give them a safer and more enjoyable gambling experience," Tjärnström pointed out.</p>
<p>Kindred has confirmed that this is just the first of other similar launches to come. The platform will be deployed across all states that the company works in, with Pennsylvania next on the map in the second half of 2023. Kindred Group’s platform solution has already received many positive responses from brands in Australia and Europe, and Kindred is determined to carry on with this legacy.</p>
<p>Kindred is a proprietary operator of gambling brands in the United States as well, meaning that the Group will focus on strengthening its own brands and making them more scalable, customizable, and ultimately safer and more enjoyable for players in the designated new markets as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Kindred Group has been also considering a sale of its business or a strategic merger, which was confirmed by the company’s Board of Directors. No further information has been offered about this and at the time, the Group confirmed that further details would most likely be revealed when a decision has been made.</p>
