<p>Sportradar Integrity Services, a global supplier of fraud detection solutions, announced a new partnership with another international sports organization, Basketball Australia.</p>
<p>Monitoring Domestic Competitions</p>
<p>The 2-year agreement between Basketball Australia and Sportradar Integrity Services (SIS) will see the deployment of Sportradar’s Universal Fraud Detection System (UFDS) for the monitoring of all domestic competitions to ensure early detection of possible fraud through betting patterns.</p>
<p>Having previously collaborated indirectly through our partnership with the National Basketball League (NBL), the Integrity Services are delighted to now sign our first direct agreement with Basketball Australia. We look forward to supporting their integrity programme for the next two years.” Andy Cunningham, Director, Global Partnerships, Sportradar Integrity Services</p>
<p>Following an agreement signed with the National Basketball League (NBL) in December 2020, Sportradar Integrity Services is now covering all basketball competitions in Australia, helping authorities to tackle fraud and protect the integrity of the sport in the country.</p>
<p>The new agreement will ensure over 150 fixtures from the Women’s National Basketball league (WNBL) and the U20 Australian Championship are being monitored by the UFDS, utilizing Sportradar Integrity Services’ 16-years of experience and expertise.</p>
<p>Simon Bishop, Executive General Manager for Governance, Risk and Integrity at Basketball Australia, outlined the “significant betting interest” in basketball on a global scale, pinpointing the partnership with Sportradar Integrity Services would strengthen Basketball Australia’s “integrity measures ahead of the new WNBL season.”</p>
<p>Sportradar’s Integrity Services’ vast knowledge in the field of sports integrity, will support the operations of our Integrity Unit to identify any betting-related manipulation threats to our competitions and address any emerging risk factors.” Simon Bishop, Executive General Manager – Governance, Risk and Integrity, Basketball Australia</p>
<p>Recognized Bet Monitoring System</p>
<p>Built on sophisticated mathematical models and utilizing machine learning, the UFDS is an advanced bet monitoring system widely adopted by sports leagues, organizations and governing bodies, following its independent assessment and verification by recognized sports betting and integrity experts.</p>
<p>Operated by a global team of qualified integrity experts, the UFDS provides essential visibility into potential match-fixing occurrences by analyzing irregular betting patterns and reporting any suspicious games to its partners. The system has brought to the attention of its partners over 600 suspicious matches in 2020 alone and more than 6,000 for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Last month, Sportradar Integrity Services reported a spike in the number of suspicious matches the UFDS had registered since April 2020, when coronavirus-related restrictions disrupted global sport, with over 1,100 suspicious events detected, of which almost half since the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>The deal with Basketball Australia comes shortly after Sportradar Integrity Services had signed with two other basketball organizations from Europe, the Slovak Basketball Association (SBA) and easyCredit Basketball Bundesliga (EasyCredit BBL), to safeguard the integrity of their sporting events.</p>
