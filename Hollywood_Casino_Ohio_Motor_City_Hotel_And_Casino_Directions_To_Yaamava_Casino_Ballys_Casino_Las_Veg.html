    <h1>Hollywood Casino Ohio Motor City Hotel And Casino Directions To Yaamava Casino Ballys Casino Las Veg</h1>

<p>Leading provider of esports wagering products and solutions Esports Technologies announced today it successfully closed the transaction with Aspire Global to acquire its B2C business.</p>
<p>Transaction Close</p>
<p>Esports Technologies and Aspire Global successfully closed the deal for the acquisition of Aspire Global’s B2C business, including its proprietary online casino and sportsbook brands Karamba, Hopa, Griffon Casino, BetTarget, Dansk777, and GenerationVIP by the esports wagering company for $75.9 million.</p>
<p>“Acquiring Aspire Global’s portfolio of innovative B2C brands, access to new markets, and its 1.25 million deposited customers is a strategic leap in our journey to become a world leader in esports wagering. We look forward to our partnership with Aspire as we continue to scale.” Aaron Speach, CEO, Esports Technologies</p>
<p>Esports Technologies and Aspire Global announced they entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the B2C business in October, to follow on their previously forged partnership in the technology space aimed at exploring mutual benefits from technology solutions.</p>
<p>The company has also gained access to gaming licensing in the UK, Germany, Ireland, Malta, and Denmark as part of the acquisition to allow the operator to boost cross-selling opportunities and increase its esports revenue, player bet transactions, and customer base.</p>
<p>“Esports Technologies has rapidly established itself as one of the foremost innovators in esports wagering. Acquiring the world-class B2C portfolio we’ve built will further expand their reach in this skyrocketing global market.” Tsachi Maimon, CEO, Aspire Global</p>
<p>Following the transaction close, Aspire Global will continue to provide the back-end technology for the acquired brands to ensure operational continuity. In addition, Aspire Global will offer wagering products of the esports wagering operator on its platform.</p>
<p>B2C Brands Continue to Grow</p>
<p>On the financial side, Aspire Global’s B2C brands generated revenue of $78.3 million for the most recent 12-month period ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 43% over the same period in the previous year, while its EBITDA stood at $7.9 million, 30% higher year-over-year. The same 12 months registered total wagers to the amount of $1.86 billion, while 1.25 million customers made deposits equaling $183 million.</p>
<p>Among the latest initiative undertaken by the leading provider of esports betting products and technologies was the launch of an affiliate program running on the company’s Eaffiliates.com platform.</p>
<p>Seeking to attract its future affiliate partners, Esports Technologies offered them a secure and reliable wagering solution that combines industry-leading odds with enticing promotions and opportunities for cross-selling, on top of the commission earnings.</p>
<p>The esports operator also filed several patent applications looking to protect its intellectual property.</p>
