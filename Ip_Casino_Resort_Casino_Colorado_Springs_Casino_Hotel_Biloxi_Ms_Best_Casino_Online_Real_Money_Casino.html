    <h1>Ip Casino Resort Casino Colorado Springs Casino Hotel Biloxi Ms Best Casino Online Real Money Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with Paddy Power casino. I registered in their online casino about a month ago, made a deposit, played a little and my account has been suspended. It happened first on the first day when I registered, I was asked for a proof of ID and address, which I submitted promptly and my account was re-activated. In about 1 week my account has been suspended again. I was asked for a photo of my bank card. I sent the photo via their chat service straigh away and I was told my account would be re-activated soon. Next day, account was still suspended. I can login, but I can't play any games or withdraw my cash from the account. I asked on live chat and was told I need to wait until a "specialist department" re-activates my account and that it should be soon, but they didn't provide any more concrete information. A week passed and my account was still deactivated. I contacted live chat and was basically told the same, they have a high number of applications and that I need to wait for the "specialist department".</p>
<p>Yesterday it has been 2 weeks since the 2nd account de-activation. So I visited a local Paddy Power betting shop and hoped the staff in the shop would help me as it's always nicer to talk to a live person than to a chat bot or wait days for an email reply. The staff in the shop seemed that they didn't want to help me at all and just told me that they couldn't help with online account problems. I was told, again, to wait for the "specialist department" to re-activate my account and they told me that this is done in order to prevent problem gamblers and money laundering. I don't really believe that. If I was a problem gambler, why did they allow me to lose £100 on slot machines in the shop yet when I won about £10 online they block my account so I cannot get my winnings? And I'm not a problem gambler, I have a strict rule where I send the same amount for gambling every month aside and if I loose it I don't play until my next pay day. I never had a problem getting my winnings in Paddy Powers shops (or other betting shops), but this was the first time I played online and I think when you speak to them face to face they pay you but if you speak to them via chat or email it's much easier to make "excuses not to pay". And I don't believe the money laundering excuse as well, if someone wins money how can that be money laundering? And if someone steals money and looses it than it's the job of the police and not of the casino to keep genuine winnings.</p>
<p>Therefore I believe the casino just wants to keep my winnings. They advertise on TV and I get pop ups when browsing that they would give me slot spins for free, but that's a trap. They did give me free spins, but when I won a little, they said if I make a deposit of £10 I would get more free spins. So I deposited £10 and did receive the free spins, but then they blocked the account and kept both my £10 and the winnings from the free spins! I talked to other people about this and they said that they played with Paddy Power online and didn't have any problems. But I don't know if I can believe that. Maybe Paddy Power pays some people to pretend to be customers in their shop and just tell the people who fall victims of their fraud that everything will be OK?</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like to ask you if you could please help me with this. The reason I trust you is that I have a friend who also had a problem with a casino (I don't think Paddy Power, but another casino) and he said that you helped him. First of all, I must say I can't pay for any lawyers or anything. I was told you solve casino issues for free and if that's the case I would be interested. If you charge for your service, then please disregard my message as I don't think it's worth paying for a dispute service when it's "only £20". While every £20 counts for me, even if I can't get it back I would more likely be interested to take action so that this type of fraud doesn't happen either to me or to other people in the future. I think this shouldn't happen in a country like a UK where a big company with shops in almost all towns that sponsors football games, has adverts everywhere on TV and the internet and then they just take the money that people deposit? Many people probably just ignore it and take it, but if they take £20 from 1.000.000 people that adds up to a "great and easy steal"! So if you could help me please let me know what I need to do. I am happy to provide all the details that you may need as long as their is nothing I need to pay for. Thank you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>
