<p>NBA Finals Odds: Repeat Showdown Between Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers</p>

<p>It’s déjà vu for the NBA Finals. The defending champion Golden State Warriors will face off against the Cleveland Cavaliers with the title on the line for the second straight year, and if the sportsbooks in Las Vegas are correct, the team from out west will once again be victorious.</p>
<p>Led by reigning two-time MVP Steph Curry, the Warriors avoided a tragic end to their historic 73-win season on May 30 by capping off three straight wins against the Oklahoma City Thunder to overcome a 3-1 series deficit.</p>
<p>LeBron James’ Cavs defeated the Toronto Raptors 4-2 after sweeping their first two opponents in the playoffs.</p>
<p>It’s the matchup everyone wanted to see: a Cavs versus Warriors rematch.</p>
<p>“You appreciate how tough it is to get back here,” Curry said following the Thunder knockout. “That’s the one thing I’ve learned. You can’t take anything for granted because it’s such a grind.”</p>
<p>Warriors Favored</p>
<p>Oddsmakers in Nevada have plenty to go on in determining the lines for the 2016 NBA Finals. Just 12 months ago, the Cavs and Warriors squared off with Golden State winning the series 4-2, their first title in 40 years.</p>
<p>Following a 73-9 regular season in which they topped Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls’ seemingly unreachable feat, the champs enter the Finals as the heavy favorite.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook has the Warriors at -210 to win the NBA title and the Cavs at +180. That means a Golden State fan will need to wager $210 to win $100, while a $100 wager on the Cavs that comes to fruition will net the bettor $180.</p>
<p>Bookmakers feel rather confident that the Warriors can once again handle the Cavs. The decision for bettors is to try and determine if LeBron James is being underestimated.</p>
<p>Last year, the Cavs played the entire series without power forward Kevin Love, and lost point guard Kyrie Irving after game one. A fully healthy Cavs should present more offensive opposition to the Warriors, but enough to overcome a team that has won 85 times (73 regular season, 12 playoffs) since they last met in the Finals?</p>
<p>That’s for the bettors to decide.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want it no other way,” Cavs shooting guard JR Smith told reporters. “We get another chance at it for one and to beat the team that beat you.”</p>
<p>Warming to Gambling</p>
<p>While the NFL continues to oppose sports betting as the Oakland Raiders mull a move to Las Vegas, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told ESPN recently that he’s ready for his league to embrace gambling.</p>
<p>“We do a lot of business internationally where sports gambling is legal. As I began to study the issue I realized that there’s this enormous . . . underground betting market in the United States,” Silver stated.</p>
<p>“Ultimately my job as commissioner is to protect the integrity of the game. When there’s an enormous amount of betting all underground, there’s no transparency. I think it should be legal, I think it should be regulated,” Silver revealed.</p>
<p>But for now, only those within Nevada borders will be able to wager on the Cavs-Warriors. Game one of the NBA Finals tips off on June 2 at 9 pm ET.</p>
