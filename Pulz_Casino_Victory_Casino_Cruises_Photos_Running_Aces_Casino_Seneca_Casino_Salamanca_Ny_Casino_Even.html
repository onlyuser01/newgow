<p>Superbet Group has announced the appointment of Hans-Holger Albrecht as its new chairman</p>
<p>The Romania-based technology and entertainment company has announced the new appointment of the European Commission president’s brother will go into effect starting February 28.</p>
<p>What Will the New Chairman Bring to the Table?</p>
<p>The group that plans to be listed on the most prestigious capital markets in the world has chosen Hans-Holger Albrecht to replace former chairman of the board Sacha Dragic. The latter will stay on the board as a member. Albrecht’s rich senior and board-level experience accumulated from several senior roles is expected to help the company go to the “next level in terms of strategic vision,” according to chief executive officer (CEO) Johnny Hartnett.</p>
<p>Hartnett also called the appointment of the new chairman “an amazing moment” for the group that is currently writing an essential page of its story. The CEO praised Albrecht’s impressive know-how in “nurturing successful companies” which is expected to help the group maximize its competitive edge and grow and thrive in global markets.</p>
<p>At the moment, Albrecht is Veon Ventures’s board member and chairman for the Scout24 Group and Storytel, an online real estate platform, and an audiobook and e-book streaming service. He was also chief executive of the popular music streaming service Deezer and has spent his time fulfilling the position of president and chief executive officer of telecom and media group Tigo/Millicom International.</p>
<p>Albrecht has expressed his pleasure in joining Superbet while speaking about the “exciting opportunity in terms of its growth trajectory and continued expansion plans” and praising the company’s ambitions, high level of innovation, and responsible approach to customers.</p>
<p>Last September, Hacksaw Gaming announced it would launch its casino content with Superbet in Romania. The same decision was announced by Evoplay during the same month.</p>
<p>Superbet Group, Ready to Enter the Big League</p>
<p>In 2019, Superbet received a strategic investment of €175 million ($185 million) from the leading international investment business Blackstone Inc. which has helped it expand its foothold in 10 countries.</p>
<p>One of the primary markets where Superbet currently operates is Romania, where the group is the nationwide leader earning 10x more than its direct competitor and second-ranking operator, Betano, as well as Belgium and Poland. There, the group also organizes a plethora of programs through its foundation and holds the greatest chess tournaments on the globe.</p>
<p>Also in Romania, Superbet runs various programs through the foundation and organizes currently the biggest chess tournament in the world. Superbet is also very active in Poland and Belgium. Last year, the company ranked in the 11th position in the top 50 most powerful gaming and sports betting companies, going up 38 positions in the past four years.</p>
<p>During the same year, the company also went up five positions in the prestigious eGaming Review (EGR) Power 50 top, reaching the 11th position compared to 17th place in 2021 and 28th place in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2023, Superbet Group plans to rank in the top ten most successful companies in the global gaming and sports betting industry, and Albrecht’s appointment is expected to help it climb to this position.</p>
