<p>Gaming supplier’s Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) and Aspire Global both posted significant revenue rises for the first half of the 2021 financial year.</p>
<p>GiG, who offers technology solutions, products and services to operators, saw its revenue for the first half of 2021 rise by 35% year-on-year, up to €37.7m. This allowed the supplier to post a profit of €1.7m for the period, a substantial rise from the €8.6m loss recorded during the same timeframe last year. EBITDA for the first six months of the year up until 30 June rose from €3.4m a year prior, up to €9.8m.</p>
<p>In terms of Q2, revenue improved by 23% up to €16.2m which the supplier said was all organic growth. EBITDA was up to €5.3m for the quarter, compared to €2.8m for the same period last year. However, the supplier posted a comprehensive loss of €500,000 for Q2 which was an improvement on the €5.4m loss in 2020. The revenue rise was helped by a record high in media service revenue, which reached €11m representing a 28% increase from last year.</p>
<p>The supplier attributed the rise to player intake and an agreement signed for GiG’s online gaming platform to power a new online casino in Europe, with its own licence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow supplier Aspire Global also posted a significant revenue increase for H1 2021. Revenue for the technology solution supplier improved by 34% up to €103.9m, with EBITDA rising by 50% up to €18.4m and EBITDA margin up 17.8% from 15.8% in 2020. Earnings after tax skyrocketed by 85% to €13m.</p>
<p>As for Q2, revenues for the supplier rose by 28% up to €55.8m, while EBITDA increased by 40% to €9.9m for the period. EBITDA margin was up to 17.7% while earnings after tax saw a 54% rise to €6.9m.</p>
<p>Aspire Global hailed the acquisition of BtoBet last September as helping the supplier to perform strongly in all segments. CEO Tsachi Maimon said he was confident the supplier, who reported a sixth consecutive quarter of "solid growth", will reach its 2021 financial targets of €200m in revenue and EBITDA of €32m. That would see an improvement on the €161.9m of revenue recorded for full-year 2020, which saw the supplier post an EBITDA of €27.1m.</p>
