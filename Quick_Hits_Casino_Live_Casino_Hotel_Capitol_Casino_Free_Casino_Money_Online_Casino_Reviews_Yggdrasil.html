    <h1>Quick Hits Casino Live Casino Hotel Capitol Casino Free Casino Money Online Casino Reviews Yggdrasil</h1>

<p>Yggdrasil and Reflex Gaming have launched the sequel to the Lucky Mushroom slot with the DoubleMax game engagement mechanic</p>
<p>The global leading gaming publisher committed to providing state-of-the-art solutions and innovative content has teamed up with one of the UK’s leading gambling machine providers to release Double Lucky Mushrooms DoubleMax.</p>
<p>The new slot is an adaptation of Relax Gaming’s original slot called Luck Mushrooms. The addition of Yggdrasil’s mesmerizing Game DoubleMax Engagement Mechanic (GEM) is one of the main things that sets the new game apart from its predecessor.</p>

<p>Join the Leprechauns and Chase the Pot of Gold!</p>
<p>Reflex Gaming invites players to embark on the fun journey in search of the much-anticipated pot of gold at the end of the rainbow on the 5×3 grid that counts 20 paylines. The overall Irish theme and feel of the game are experienced through the specific graphics elements representing the game symbols. The list includes pots of gold, leprechaun hats, and vividly colored Gaelic runes acting.</p>
<p>Seeing a Wild Clover symbol land anywhere on the reels while engaged in the base game will automatically expand the reels and fill up the whole column.</p>
<p>Landing a minimum of three Free Spins symbols brings players at least eight free spins. During the bonus round, all mushroom symbols popping on the grid reward players with a mystery surprise.</p>
<p>When the Lady Luck symbol lands on reel number five, its multiplier doubles starting at 2x and can ultimately attract a massive win. All mushroom prizes are multiplied by the value of this symbol when both are seen on the grid.</p>
<p>Wishing Well Bonus – Choose Your Lucky Bucket!</p>
<p>Having at least three Wishing Well icons land during a spin brings players face-to-face with an interactive choice of wells. Any of these wells can reward them with a cash value. Its value depends on what is found inside the bucket selected by the player.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions will allow players to use Bonus Buy to purchase the bonus round and be automatically rewarded with Free Spins or jump straight into the Wishing Well round.</p>
<p>Reflex Gaming’s chief product officer Mat Ingram spoke about the huge success of their original multichannel game and the feeling of nostalgia that is expected to make old players want to go back to the classic gameplay. He also discussed the modern updates and innovations embedded in the new release, including the DoubleMax mechanic which has significantly boosted volatility and helped the game cover a greater audience.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy praised their ongoing partnership with Reflex Gaming which “repeatedly delivers popular, engaging hits through the YG Masters program”.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Yggdrasil and Peter &amp; Sons released Dragon Blox GigaBlox with the same popular GEM. Relax Gaming also introduced Horror Hotel, a horror-themed slot meant to boost the positive momentum gained by the provider in recent months.</p>
