    <h1>Aztec Casino Las Vegas Nv Spirit Mountain Casino Grand Ronde Resorts Casino Hotel Atlantic City Hard</h1>

<p>Hello dear community, maybe someone can help me here.</p>
<p>Actually, I've been satisfied with Boom and my own for over 2 months now, as even larger payouts of up to 7 / 8k were absolutely no problem.</p>
<p>-&gt; Until last week Thursday the following happened.</p>
<p>That day I went through a slightly longer session, initially with losses. As a result I had to deposit a lot, of course, but it doesn't matter because I have won a lot of money in the last few months (not only at Boom but also at Tipico and interwetten) so I deposited a total of around 15k but in the end also with good luck and a bit of "strategy" to work my way up to 21k through Crazy Time.</p>
<p>This is the amount that is at stake now.</p>
<p>Because suddenly a message appeared that "act" would be necessary.</p>
<p>So an extended verification and protection against money laundering blah blah ... so I have their one click system from BaFin -&gt; digitally and fully automatically carried out the verification process to the best of my knowledge. This gives you access to my account statements and since everything is legal and legal for me, I have zero problems with it and I am cooperative.</p>
<p>This was followed by a message from the support that I should prove my salary on the basis of statements and now it comes to explain 2 payments in February to my account. This is an amount of 2900 euros (motorcycle sales) and 1080 euros because I sold my 19 inch original Audi rims ... so I'm already thinking how please?</p>
<p>Ok, come on. It doesn't matter, I thought .... I have no problem with my accounts and I made them available immediately. I said the rest were private sales and that they were none of their business.</p>
<p>Now they still wanted a receipt for the two sales. Fortunately, I had a private sales contract drawn up back then because the buyer wanted it that way.</p>
<p>I sent it yesterday and sent it back to you ... but for the rims, there is simply nothing that I have now clearly highlighted and conveyed to them. We're talking about 1080 euros here .....</p>
<p>What can I do now ? That takes a long time every time, and takes 2/3 days for an answer. Do you have any advice? Can i turn to someone? In a pinch, somehow claim back the paid-in money? Is that possible? I made screenshots of everything to be able to prove everything. Would be grateful for any help or suggestions</p>
<p>At the end I added the following to the email.</p>
<p>"So again, all financial transactions on my part have nothing to do with money laundering or anything like that. If this is still not enough for you, I will first submit a complaint to the MGA (Malta Gaming Authority) and ask for help / verification. If I am not helped there, I will hire a lawyer based in Malta who specializes in gambling law and let him clarify the problem for me. "</p>
