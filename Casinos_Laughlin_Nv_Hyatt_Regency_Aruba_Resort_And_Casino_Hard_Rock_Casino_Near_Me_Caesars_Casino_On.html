    <h1>Casinos Laughlin Nv Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort And Casino Hard Rock Casino Near Me Caesars Casino On</h1>

<p>The only 24-hour live gaming casino in Merchant City has launched an irresistible invitation to one of its wildest parties yet. Grosvenor Casino Glasgow has gone through an extensive £3.5 million ($4.3 million) refurbishing and modernization and it is finally ready to once again open its doors to the public. What better way to do it than by throwing a massive day and night party with top-notch entertainment and a prize draw held every hour?</p>
<p>Get Ready for a Relaxed Brunch</p>
<p>The party will be held at the casino’s location on 16-18 Glassford Street and it will kick off at 8 pm. However, the “night you won’t want to miss” will usher in guests between 12 pm and 2 pm and 2 pm and 4 pm, just in time for the special bubbles and brunch event. Saxophonist Lewis Ip will be responsible for creating a relaxed atmosphere during the festive brunch with food from the casino’s brand new restaurant and bar for a small fee of £25pp.</p>
<p>The casino has become a world-class hub for entertainment with a vibrant feel and a modern look strengthened by the stylish bar and restaurant additions. The new venue is also home to brand new slot machines, top-notch roulette and blackjack tables, and one of the best live sports viewing areas in Merchant City.</p>
<p>Magician Steven Blair Will Welcome the Guests</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the evening events wil begin at 8 pm and last until the late hours of the night. Guests will still be served tasty drinks and foods upon arrival, prior to being swept off their feet by one of the most famous magicians in Scotland, Steven Blair. Blair will constantly interact with the guests during the event right next to Tony Kay, a singer who will bring tribute to Take’s That’s lead singer Gary Barlow. Kay will interpret both classic Take That hits as well as many of Garlow’s solo songs.</p>
<p>Popular Scottish dishes like Haggis Croquettes, burgers, steaks, a plethora of other tasty dishes, drinks, and desserts are all part of the new menu at the restaurant that is now ready for booking.</p>
<p>Grosvenor Casino Glasgow’s general manager Debbie Johnston expressed the casino’s delight to officially relaunch and prove the value of their “world-class entertainment venue” ready to offer guests an unforgettable experience never seen before. Johnston invited everyone eager to discover the excellent gaming, sports watching, and dining upgrades to join them at the July 2 party.</p>
<p>The event will also host a unique poker tournament dedicated to the same casino relaunch event. The poker event will start at 6 pm, with a guaranteed prize pool of £10,000 ($12,300).</p>
