<p>XB Net, a leading horse racing content provider for the North American market, has finalized a renewal agreement with Codere. Thanks to this development, the latter will receive a major boost to its US greyhounds and horse racing portfolio across retail and digital platforms.</p>
<p>Codere Will Gain Access to 75% Of Racing Events Across the US</p>
<p>With the latest deal, XB Net’s network of 60 tracks, which is more than 75% of US horse racing, will be available on the betting platform of the Spanish operator. Services such as betting, live pictures, and event data will be distributed to Codere as well.</p>
<p>That way, Codere will be able to provide its customers with engaging content and thus, enhance the overall experience.</p>
<p>Codere’s content and supplier manager, Borja Mata, shared a few words on the development. Mata said that the contract renewal is among the “rare silver linings to the pandemic” and hence, Codere’s customers can appreciate and reap the benefits that are brought by US racing.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mata noted that Spain’s time zone is well-placed and thanks to that fact, it is able to transition nicely into the meetings. He concluded by saying that everyone at the Spanish operator is looking forward to seeing how the innovative products will perform.</p>
<p>The senior vice president of international at XB Net, Simon Fraser, praised Codere by saying that it is a “giant brand” that is the best in what it does. That is why he considers this the perfect opportunity for XB Net to partner with the Spanish sportsbook.</p>
<p>Fraser added that Spanish fans of US horse racing have been retained during the pandemic and the partnership will fix that issue. As a concluding matter, Fraser stated that horse and greyhound races are extremely popular and their influence grows each day, especially in the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Spanish operators, one of which is Codere, have noticed this surge and are looking to capitalize on it, according to Fraser.</p>
<p>Authorities in Spain are looking to regulate the betting/gambling industry far more effectively and Madrid is at the forefront of the reforms.</p>
<p>Codere Is One of Spain’s Most Well-Established Operators</p>
<p>Codere is arguably the most reputable betting operator in Spain. It operates in a total of 5 countries – Spain, Uruguay, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico. In Brazil, Panama, and Uruguay, Codere operates under the Turff Bet &amp; Sports Bar brand.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was the first company that was authorized to run sports betting services in Spain. The first betting room of the company was opened in Madrid, on April 16, 2008.</p>
<p>In 2013, Codere doubled down on its support of the values in sport by signing the Corporate Commitment by the Clean Sport. The Corporate Commitment by Clean Sport promotes good practice and zero tolerance for sports doping around the world. Codere became the first company in the gambling industry to sign this commitment. Back in July 2022, Codere also showed its support for women’s football as it donated $300,000 to NGO “She Wins.”</p>
