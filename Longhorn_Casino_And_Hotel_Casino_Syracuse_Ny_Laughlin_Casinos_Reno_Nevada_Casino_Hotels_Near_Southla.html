    <h1>Longhorn Casino And Hotel Casino Syracuse Ny Laughlin Casinos Reno Nevada Casino Hotels Near Southla</h1>

<p>Hello!.</p>
<p>First of all I want to say that I am new to this forum and it has occurred to me to assist you because I analyze that you are very intelligent people, with studies superior to mine and which could help me to use mathematics in games of chance the Mario Slot . Perhaps many do not know it and others do, the joke is that I met him recently and the truth is that these machines have been around for a long time, however my curiosity is born in knowing how mathematics works in these slots, since I usually design the mathematics of the classic 5 reels.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My query is to clarify how to calculate the player's return on these machines. I have made a small excel to take down as it could be the possible victories, forms and list of payments. I do not know if I am calculating the Player Return well but I would like to know based on the knowledge that you have how I could calculate the% RTP on these machines.</p>
<p>From already thank you very much.</p>
