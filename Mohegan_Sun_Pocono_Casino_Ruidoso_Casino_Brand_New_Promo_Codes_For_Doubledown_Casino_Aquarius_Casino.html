    <h1>Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino Ruidoso Casino Brand New Promo Codes For Doubledown Casino Aquarius Casino</h1>

<p>Kim Kardashian can grab headlines lightly – her mere presence is usually enough, and the 41-year-old media mogul and entrepreneur has been successful at building her personality, brand, and business over the years. Now, she’s part of wild speculation at sports betting operators such as Bovada and OddsChecker, who are trying to pinpoint who might become the next boyfriend to the newly single mother-of-four after she ended things with Pete Davidson.</p>
<p>Some Old Flames and Known Faces</p>
<p>The websites have listed an interesting selection of potential suitors, involving some former romances, predicating the odds on some gossips, and some out-of-the-blue suggestions as well. OddsChecker is banking on Van Jones, a CNN contributor who has (+800) odds of making this happen. Ray J and Nick Cannon, both of whom have been romantically involved with Kardashian in the past, are posted at odds of (+1,000) a decent enough chance.</p>
<p>Kardashian and Ray J had a fraught relationship following a leaked sex tape in 2007. The tape has been a talking point to this day with Kanye West, Kim’s former husband, meeting Ray J to obtain a computer where the tape was stored. Cannon though is unlikely contender as he has eight kids of his own.</p>
<p>But the list of potential suitors doesn’t end up at former or scandalous paramours. There is Jamie Foxx, given (+1,200) and Chris Evans, a Cincinnati Bengals running back at (+1,400), along with Harry Styles (+2,000). Not all is settled though, as Kanye and Kim may still get back together, even though the implied chance of this happening is 4.3% according to OddsChecker or (+2,200).</p>
<p>Wild Cards and Out-of-the-Box Thinking</p>
<p>Then you have Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt both of whom are given around 1% chance or odds of (+10,000). Eminem is given another (+6,500) with even Donald Trump himself featured on this list with the incredible (+20,000). Trump has a far better chance at winning the US Presidency for a second term at around (+300) than conquering Kim’s heart.</p>
<p>The list is quite entertaining in a sense, with tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos both featured as viable options never mind their wildcard status.</p>
