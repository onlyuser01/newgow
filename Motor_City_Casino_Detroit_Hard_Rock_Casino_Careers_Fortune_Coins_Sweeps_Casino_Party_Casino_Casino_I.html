<p>Unlike other jurisdictions, there isn’t just one regulator of online gambling in Curaçao. The Curaçao Gaming Control Board is the supervisor for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT) for all gambling activities, but online gambling is also regulated by the Ministry of Finance and Financial Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of a single, independent, regulatory body, the authority to grant licenses and ensure casinos are following regulations has been delegated to four third-party operators, called Master License Operators (MLO), one of which is known as Curacao eGaming.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been legal in Curaçao since 1993, with the introduction of the National Ordinance on Offshore Games of Hazard legislation, and the first license was issued by Curacao eGaming in 1996. As such, Curaçao eGaming is one of the oldest regulators of its kind.</p>
<p>Curaçao eGaming licenses are attractive to operators for several reasons:</p>
<p>Only one license is needed to be able to operate all types of gambling activities.</p>
<p>The process of obtaining a license is quite simple and cheap in comparison to other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are supported, permitting them to be used a payment method.</p>
<p>Only 2% tax must be paid on net profits from a gambling business, there is currently 0% VAT and 0% corporate income tax (great for fledgling companies and start-ups)</p>
<p>How to check a Curacao eGaming license is legitimate</p>
<p>It is always recommended to check the validity of any license a casino states it operates under, as unfortunately there are those casinos that try to trick players into a false sense of security with a fake license.</p>
<p>To check a CEG license (1668 / JAZ) is valid, the easiest way is to click on the validator on the website of the casino. This will usually appear as a small, clickable logo:</p>

<p>Every casino licensed by Curaçao should display the seal of their license on their website, and it can usually be found in the footer at the bottom of the page. Once clicked, you will be taken to the validator page, where you can check the status of the license:</p>

<p>The license status should of course be “LICENSED”, but you should also check that the URL of the website is correct and secure (the part in bold will always be the same):</p>
