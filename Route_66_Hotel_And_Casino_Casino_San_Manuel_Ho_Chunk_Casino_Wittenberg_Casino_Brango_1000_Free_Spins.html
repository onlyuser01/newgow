<p>Oakland Raiders Expected to Play in San Francisco, Super Bowl 54 Odds Favor Kansas City Chiefs</p>

<p>The Oakland Raiders will relocate to Las Vegas in 2020, but in the interim, the NFL franchise needs a temporary home. Rumors suggest they have found it by way of Oracle Park in nearby San Francisco.</p>

<p>The Associated Press says sources close to the situation report that while a deal hasn’t been reached, it’s close. One potential hurdle to overcome is the San Francisco 49ers would need to approve of the temporary move, as the franchise has territorial rights on the city.</p>
<p>In December, the City of Oakland sued the Raiders and team owner Mark Davis on grounds that the Las Vegas transfer violates antitrust laws and leaves the city with an outstanding debt totaling $80 million incurred from renovations made to the Coliseum. The Raiders have played in Oakland since 1995.</p>
<p>Oracle Park is the home of the MLB San Francisco Giants. However, it has also hosted football games, most notable the XFL San Francisco Demons and California Golden Bears.</p>
<p>Too Early Odds</p>
<p>It’s been less than 24 hours since the New England Patriots topped the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in a snoozer of a Super Bowl. Oddsmakers, however, are already looking forward to next year.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook believes the Kansas City Chiefs are the favorites at 6/1. The Patriots, Rams, and New Orleans Saints are next at 7/1. They’re also the only other teams with single-digit odds for Super Bowl 54.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers, Los Angeles Chargers, and Chicago Bears come in next at 14/1.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns – and five other teams – are at 20/1. After going 1-31 in 2016 and 2017, the Browns won seven games in 2018. They entered the 2018 NFL season at 80/1 to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Longshots for 2019 include the Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals, all of which are at 100/1.</p>
<p>The longest odds in the entire NFL come on the Miami Dolphins: 300/1. A $100 bet and the Dolphins winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy nets a cool $30,000. The implied odds of winning are just 0.33 percent.</p>
<p>Burned Bridges</p>
<p>Davis had originally intended to keep the Raiders in Oakland for one final year. But after the city sued him, he explained, “Emotionally, why would I give them $3 million to $5 million in rent that they’re going to turn around and use to sue me?”</p>
<p>But at the same time, if they’ll have us, I can’t turn on the fans. I can’t do it. And this is terrible negotiating I’m doing,” Davis stated. “I’m going to get killed. But that’s just the way I am.”</p>
<p>Tensions have long been strained between Davis’ Raiders and the Bay Area’s other NFL franchise. That’s why playing at the 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium is thought to largely be a longshot. Team officials haven’t commented on whether they might support allowing the Raiders to play in the Giants’ ballpark.</p>
