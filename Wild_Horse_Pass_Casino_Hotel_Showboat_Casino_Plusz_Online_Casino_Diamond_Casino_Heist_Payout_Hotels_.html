<p>Big Time Gaming (BTG) has pushed out its Golden Catch Megaways slot in the United States in what is a first move into the country by the company, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release. Golden Catch is one of the developer’s most acclaimed titles, which is now available in five US states, including Connecticut, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
<p>The rollout has been facilitated with EvolutionOne Stop Shop (OSS) and this collaboration will allow the company to deploy its iconic game with regulated and licensed local brands in each of the aforementioned markets.</p>
<p>The Megaways mechanic is one of the most innovative concepts in the iGaming industry, with BTG having devised a way to boost the number of paylines to 117,649 options on its iconic games. Since it was introduced, the feature has also been adopted by third-party studios that are licensing it to introduce their own products.</p>
<p>As to Golden Catch Megaways, this fisherman-themed game comes with plenty of excellent surprises along the way. There are Fish Bonus Prizes, Golden Boats, Fish Bonus Multipliers, and more, along with a Free Spins round to add to your overall chance of success. There is also a feature called Win Exchange for even bigger opportunities to trigger Free Spins.</p>
<p>This feature is available when you win anything between 25 and 100 times your stake. You may exchange your winnings for 10 free spins and keep the reels going. Plus, there is a dedicated Bonus Buy feature which allows you to trigger 10 free spins in exchange for 100 times the stake.</p>
<p>BTG CEO Nik Robinson welcomed this collaborative opportunity and said that it was a great opportunity to see the game roll out in the United States, and across so many markets at once. "With its hugely engaging base game and astounding bonus feature, this slot was a huge hit in Europe, and we predict it will become a big favorite in the US too," Robinson concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Evolution CCO for North America Jeff Millar said that the addition of BTG is a game-changer in the gaming space. Golden Catch, the executive said, is one of the best examples of what the Megaways genre brings to the table.</p>
<p>"Now, we’re starting to roll BTG games out to the US markets, and it’s great to see how much they resonate with a US audience. It just goes to show that a good game is universal," Millar wrapped up.</p>
