<p>New South Wales has decided to allocate AU$100m to bolster the state’s efforts in reducing problem gambling and gambling-related harm. The financial injection does not come fully from the state’s budget but is rather collected from Star Casino which was hit with a proportionate AU$100m fine by the NSW Independent Casino Commission.</p>
<p>The funds collected through this enforcement action are being allocated to various initiatives aimed at reducing gambling harm over a period of five years. The government has published details about how the allocation of funds ought to happen in the designated period.</p>
<p>For the first period designated as 2023-2024, the government will allocate AU$10m to the Responsible Gambling Fund. The money will be used to strengthen various campaigns and initiatives, such as Reclaim the Game, and help bolster research efforts to ensure that the NSW government has an evidence-led approach when issuing changes to gambling law.</p>
<p>Another AU6.4m will go to improving self-exclusion schemes and adding more third-party exclusions in pubs and clubs, which are often tied to high gambling losses and probably originators of much of the problem gambling that is registered in the state.</p>
<p>Then, there is another AU$3.4m, which the government has decided to allocate to an independent expert panel, taking a closer look at cashless gaming – a much-debated matter that could potentially further reduce gambling harm, combat money laundering, but also potentially alienate customers.</p>
<p>Then, another AU$21.7m will be allocated each year for three consecutive years starting in the financial year 2024/25 to fund various gambling harm minimization efforts, reforms, the Independent Panel and more. The Minns Labor Government Budget is determined to make this a reality.</p>
<p>NSW Premier Chris Minns has made decisive steps towards regulating gambling and attempting to better understand the matter. Some of the important decisions taken since he took office in March include the reduction of the cash input limit from AU$5,000 to AU$500 at poker machines, which came into effect on July 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The Independent Panel that will now offer continued help in minimizing harm was also established with the Minns Cabinet’s blessing. External gambling messaging was also banned earlier this month as part of the reform. The government also reduced the number of allowed machines as well.</p>
<p>Overall, New South Wales is keeping a firm hand at the rudder, trying to navigate the dynamic world of gambling regulation and bringing solutions that are believed to be in the customer’s best interest.</p>
