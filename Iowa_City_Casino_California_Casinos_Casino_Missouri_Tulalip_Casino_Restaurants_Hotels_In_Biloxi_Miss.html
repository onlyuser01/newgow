<p>Olivier Pribile is the latest director to join Pari-Mutuel Urbain. In this position, the appointee will oversee the company’s product and marketing efforts</p>
<p>Pari-Mutuel Urbain (PMU), а French horse racing operator, has expanded its team with the addition of Olivier Pribile as its new director of marketing and product. The experienced worker will leverage his experience with the racing sector to help the company improve its products and help it reach more players.</p>
<p>Pribile to Help PMU Grow</p>
<p>As the new director of marketing and product at PMU, Pribile will work to expand the company’s portfolio and popularize its content. In addition, he will be responsible for evaluating customer data and making sure that they are happy with PMU’s products. Lastly, Pribile will be among the people working on the company’s strategic plan for the next few years.</p>
<p>Pribile is an experienced worker that will be a great addition to PMU’s team. He has a wealth of experience in the sports betting and horse racing sector thanks to his prior tenure at Française des Jeux (FDJ). Pribile, therefore, has the knowledge needed to help his new company push forward as it cements itself as a leading force in the French market.</p>
<p>PMU just announce a three-year plan to grow its annual stakes to over a billion dollars. The company also hopes to reach many new players, expanding the total number of customers to 4 million. In order to achieve these goals, the company will develop new marketing channels – something that Pribile will be directly responsible for.</p>
<p>Pribile Has Tons of Experience thanks to His Tenure at FDJ</p>
<p>Pribile, who is currently an investor at Abeye, is also the co-founder of the bilingual nursery Claudine Olivier – a venture he helped launch in 2017. From 2021 to January this year, Pribile served as the chief marketing officer and sales director of Atol les Opticiens, a company specializing in the production of glasses.</p>
<p>His most relevant experience, however, is his 12-year tenure at FDJ, one of the powerhouses in the French lottery and gaming market. Pribile occupied various positions during his long service.</p>
<p>Between 2009 and 2014, he served as FDJ’s country manager and project leader for international games in Europe. Following that, he had a three-year stint as the head of draw-based games. In 2017, Pribile was promoted to marketing director for digital, branding and media – a position he occupied until his leave in 2021.</p>
<p>PMU has been working hard to hone its team since last summer when it welcomed Emmanuelle Malecaze-Doublet as its new chief executive officer. This was big news as she was the first woman to head PMU in its almost century-long history.</p>
