<p>BetGames.TV continues to grow rapidly, and the company has started a campaign to hire 100+ new employees who will help it grow even further in Africa. The company has set future plans to tap into other markets across Europe, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>BetGames.TV Campaign to Hire Employees for Malta and Vilnius</p>
<p>Award-winning and seven times nominated for SBC Awards gaming giant BetGames.TV has had a pretty successful 2020. The Company won two Awards, “Leader of the Year” and “Live Casino Supplier of the Year,” and has boosted the company’s presence in Africa by striking a deal with Sunbet.</p>
<p>The company further plans to hire more than a hundred new employees, who will start work in its offices in Malta and Vilnius. This move will allow the company to continue growing in the industry. New staff members will provide support for new and existing clients, help with future partners and assist in future plans to tap into vast markets across Europe, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>BetGames. TV’s CEO, Andreas Koeberl, had this to say: “It’s been a busy few years for us all, positioning BetGames.TV is the industry’s preferred supplier of content, but now we’re here. The work continues to not only keep us there but push on to achieve greater success and a truly unique betting experience. Exciting times are ahead!”</p>
<p>The company had a rapid increase in customers in 2020 due to the top-tier games that BetGames.TV offers to players some of them include fan favorites like Wheel of Fortune, War of Bets, and 6+ Poker as well as Rock Paper Scissors.</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming Partners with TVBET for an HD Lift</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming’s partnership with TVBET will see the company expand its iGaming platform. TVBET will bring twelve new games to the table with titles such as 21Bet and WheelBet as well as HD titles like 5Bet lottery game and Backgammon.</p>
<p>This partnership will help Pronet establish a presence in new and growing markets in 2021 and provide potential clients with a new and improved HD live gaming platform.</p>
<p>Peter Korpusenko, a TVBET CEO, said: “The partnership between TVBET and Pronet Gaming is an excellent step towards our common goal of providing high-quality content to bookmakers and casinos, both online and offline. We are delighted to team up with the Pronet Gaming platform, with a shared vision and mission.”</p>
<p>Pronet also has a footstep in Africa and has plans to expand even further. The company hired an innovative and experienced new director of sales for Africa, Mark Schmidt. Schmidt has more than 11 years of experience in the region and will prove an asset in Pronets’ plan to establish a large presence in Africa.</p>
