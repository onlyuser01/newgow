<p>The regulator focused on the online gambling market’s impact on the overall landscape, presenting a comprehensive overview of data and trends</p>
<p>Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), the Gambling Authority of the Netherlands, has unveiled its 2022 Market Scan, providing insights into the performance and regulated activities of the Dutch gambling market. The document complements the KSA’s recent industry report, highlighting the need for updated responsible gambling practices to remain up-to-date with shifting trends.</p>
<p>Online Gaming Is Taking Center Stage</p>
<p>The 2022 Market Scan is the first opportunity for Dutch authorities to evaluate a year’s worth of data following the KOA online gambling marketplace’s official launch on 1 October 2021. According to the regulator, opening the market for online operators significantly affected the land-based gambling sector, as customers received unprecedented choices.</p>
<p>In 2022, online gambling contributed 31% of the total gross gaming revenue (GGR), with land-based properties comprising 69%. The land-based sector declined significantly by 30%, highlighting changing player preferences. The KSA was hopeful that land-based casinos could still be suffering the pandemic’s aftermath and might recover to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>While significantly smaller than the casino segment, sports betting experienced substantial growth, generating a 260% increase in GGR, amounting to €319 million. Online bookmakers were responsible for 83% of this total. The 2022 scan revealed that the sports betting sector’s market share had grown from 4% in 2021 to almost 10% in 2022.</p>
<p>Kansspelautoriteit Remains Committed to Player Safety</p>
<p>The Netherlands’ gross gaming result for legal games of chance amounted to €3.4 billion in 2022, compared to a BSR of €2 billion in 2021. Part of this growth is due to the increase in online gambling. However, an increase in land-based supply compared to the previous year also contributed as casinos and other establishments reopened after the pandemic.</p>
<p>The KSA will use this data to remain in touch with the latest industry trends and adapt its policies to match rising challenges. The Authority regularly updates its regulatory framework, recently prohibiting operators from advertising on publicly visible spaces and media. Moreover, KSA will conduct rigorous checks to ensure that operators target an audience aged 24 or older.</p>
<p>KSA’s 2022 Market Scan demonstrates record growth in GGR but also reveals a constantly shifting gambling landscape. This data will be vital in crafting 2023’s regulatory adjustments and ensuring operators follow responsible gambling practices. The regulator’s continued vigilance remains instrumental in giving Dutch customers adequate protection as operators achieve sustainable growth.</p>
