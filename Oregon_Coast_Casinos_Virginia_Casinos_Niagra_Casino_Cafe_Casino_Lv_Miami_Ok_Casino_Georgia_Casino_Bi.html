<p>Georgia Casino Bill in Peril, Hearing Canceled Due to Lack of Interest</p>

<p>Georgia’s casino legislation was apparently snubbed by a Senate committee on Thursday, but can Senator Brandon Beach (R-Alpharetta) still drum up the support he needs to push it out of the Senate and into the House by the early March deadline?</p>
<p>He’s not giving up hope.</p>

<p>Beach’s bill has been described by local press as “on life support” following the cancellation of a Senate committee hearing this week.</p>
<p>It was hoped that SB 79, which proposes legalizing two casinos in a state, would be more palatable to lawmakers than last year’s ill-fated effort because it proposes fewer casinos and a higher percentage of funding for school programs.</p>
<p>The bill wants to put the question to the public in November 2018 referendum, asking voters whether they want to change the constitution to permit casino gaming.</p>
<p>One Foot in the Grave</p>
<p>It was largely well received at its first hearing several weeks ago, a public debate organized by the Regulated Industries Committee.</p>
<p>Even Governor Nathan Deal, a longtime casino opponent, is, for once, not in outright opposition. He has said he he is willing “to keep the discussion going” with casino supporters.</p>
<p>But on late Wednesday Senator Rick Jeffares notified members of the Regulated Industries Committee that the planned meeting would not go ahead. A committee member told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in confidence that Jeffares had polled the committee and “opposition was overwhelming so he told me there would be no hearing.”</p>
<p>The anonymous Senator added that has far, as he could see, the bill was “sounding pretty dead.”</p>
<p>Undeterred, Beach said on Thursday that he would apply to have the hearing rescheduled and is confident he can rally the troops behind him.</p>
<p>“I have asked to be on the agenda Monday,” he said. “That will give me more time to shore up the votes. It’s real close right now.”</p>
<p>Support in the House</p>
<p>One of the proposed casino licenses would be for a development in the Metro Atlanta area and another in a smaller city, possibly Savannah or Columbus.</p>
<p>Developers would need to guarantee investment of at least $2 billion in the Atlanta resort and a minimum of $450 million in the secondary resort.</p>
<p>But before any of that can happen, Beach needs to get it out of the committee, passed by the Senate, and into the House by a March 3 “cross over day,” which is looking like an increasingly tall order.</p>
<p>“I think if we can get this into the chamber, more people are for it,” Beach said. “We have to get it out of committee.”</p>
<p>A poll organized by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution suggests there is public support for casinos. It found 56 percent of registered voters supported the idea, with only 38 percent opposed.</p>
