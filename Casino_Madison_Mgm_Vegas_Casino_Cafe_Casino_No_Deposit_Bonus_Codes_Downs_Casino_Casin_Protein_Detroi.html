<p>The unnamed victim and a woman, described by police as his 25-year-old girlfriend, got into a fight at about 1:48 a.m. in the garage, according to Click on Detroit, a local online news site.</p>
<p>A third person, who remains unidentified, began to shoot a firearm in an effort to intervene in the dispute, the report said. The 25-year-old died from wounds suffered during the shooting.</p>
<p>As of mid-day Sunday, Detroit cops continued to investigate the shooting. Further details on the crime were not released by local police as of noon Sunday.</p>
<p>It is believed officers were looking for possible witnesses and searched the garage for physical evidence, too. The local medical examiner’s office is likely to perform an autopsy on the victim.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Motor City Casino released a statement to WXYZ, a local TV station, which said, “The security of our guests and employees is our top priority.</p>
<p>“Early this morning, there was an incident in our parking structure. This is an ongoing investigation, and we are fully cooperating with local law enforcement agencies.”</p>
<p>Members of the public who have information on the shooting can call Detroit police at 313-596-2260 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-Speak-Up.</p>
<p>US Casino Parking Lots, Garages Sites for Violent Crime</p>
<p>Nationally, parking garages and lots at gaming properties were frequently the location of violent crimes in the past year, according to a report from Casino.org.</p>
<p>For instance, in February two men needed hospitalization after getting stabbed several times in a parking garage at the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nev.</p>
<p>Also, two bandits attacked an elderly man last Christmas Day in a Las Vegas gaming property parking garage before stealing his wallet. The victim of the assault at Sam’s Town Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall was believed to be in his 90s, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>In October, Palm Springs, Calif. police officers shot two robbery suspects as they tried to speed away from a parking garage at Agua Caliente Casino. One had just allegedly robbed a woman at gunpoint.</p>
<p>The October incident followed a September shooting at a parking garage at the same gaming property. The earlier violent attack at the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians’-owned casino was investigated as an attempted homicide.</p>
<p>Last August, a fatal shooting took place at an Emerald Queen Casino garage in Tacoma, Wash. In July, another fatal shooting occurred at Winner’s Way parking garage in Florida’s Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood.</p>
