    <h1>Indian Casinos In California Palm Springs Casinos Casino Near Sedona Az Turning Stone Casino How Old</h1>

<p>Dear aatorssi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gambling section, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Standby or cool-off periods / Self exclusion:</p>
<p>If you believe that playing games might affect your life in a negative way, we at Bet it All are able to help you. We provide you with the ability to exclude yourself from playing on our site for various periods of time. We offer 24-hour stand-by periods as well as 7 day, 30 day, 2 month restrictions and longer timeouts (only with email confirmation on security@betitall.com. When sending an request to security@betitall.com, please make sure that this message is directly addressed and not a forward or carbon copy (cc). There is a high possibility that these types of emails will go into Spam and therefore won't be viewed by the relevant department). You will not be able to access the games and/or services of Bet it All. Once you ask for a self-exclusion period, you have to close all tables at which you are playing and log out from your account. Once you have done that, the time out or self-exclusion period will begin. You will not be able to deposit or withdrawal and make inter-account transfers with your Bet it All account. Furthermore, you will not receive any marketing emails or newsletters from Bet it All after your cool off period has been initiated. It is important for Bet it All to receive information about your reasons as to why limit your account. The staff members of Bet it All have been trained in social responsibility and are trained to deal with compulsive gambling behaviour. They are always there to assist you with personal aid or guidance as to where you should go to find further help. If Bet it All recognises that gambling can cause serious financial harm to the Customer it reserves the right to close the players account in order to help overcome any addiction thereof."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s not written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have requested a self-exclusion from this casino directly?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
