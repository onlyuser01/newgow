    <h1>Chumba Casino Limitless Casino Log In Arizona Casinos With Hotels Ice Casino Allegany Seneca Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Limitless Casino has not given me my $50.00 withdrawal, and I keep getting the run around. I have:</p>
<h1>1 Played through my free bonus.</h1>
<h1>2 Verified my email.</h1>
<h1>3 Verified my full name, address, date of birth, address.</h1>
<h1>4 Emailed my Bitcoin address.</h1>
<h1>5 Deposited $15.00 (only $10.00 was required)</h1>
<h1>6 Replied to all emails.</h1>
<h1>7 Was told by chat to go through the withdrawal again. I did so 5 different times. Some in Firefox and some in Chrome.</h1>
<h1>8 I was told in Chat that I need to reply to 'their' emails. I replied to 17 different emails.</h1>
<h1>9 I was then told to send an email to Pitboss@LimitlessCasino.com and I did.</h1>
<h1>10 I was then told to send an email to Manager@LimitlessCasino.com and I did.</h1>
<h1>11 Then I was told to send an email to Support@LimitlessCasino.com and I did.</h1>
<h1>12 Then I was told to send an email to Banking @ LimitlessCasino.com and I did.</h1>
<h1>13 Each time I sent an email I had my information enclosed with in the email. Sometimes I would attach screenshots of the withdrawal.</h1>
<h1>14 I've done everything I'm supposed to do, and have spent countless hours with chat only to receive the run around. I feel like I've been scammed. Chat is not very helpful and email send 'canned' messages.</h1>
<p>Can you help me get my $50.00?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Susan</p>
