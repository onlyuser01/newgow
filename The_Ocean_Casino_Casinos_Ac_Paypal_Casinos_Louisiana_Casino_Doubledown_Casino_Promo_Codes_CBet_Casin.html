    <h1>The Ocean Casino Casinos Ac Paypal Casinos Louisiana Casino Doubledown Casino Promo Codes CBet Casin</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Cbet blocked account 15.02.2023. I don’t know what I have done wrong. I havent breached any of their terms. They sent me an email though, stating: "We have detected suspicious activity on your account regarding your play pattern.</p>
<p>As a result, your account is now permanently blocked. Unfortunately, you will no longer be able to use our platform and there are no refunds to be made."</p>
<p>What the "suspicious activity on your account regarding your play pattern" is, I have no idea. I made some profitable bets that beat the price before kickoff. They might have been thinking I was a arbitrage player, or problem player? If they review my play history many of my bets had bad kickoff price. Some where good, some where bad, but the price on exchanges and rest of the bookies where the same as cbets prices. So how can my play pattern be "suspicious activity" when every casino offer the same price? Yes sometimes the bets price falls a couple of days after my bets, how is that my fault?</p>
<p>I passed their KYC twice. I have had several withdrawals with them in 2022, no issue. I only have one account. I didn’t breach any of their terms nor have they accused me of breaching any.</p>
<p>It is very dramatic to suddenly lock my 30 000 € balance for being somewhat competent when placing bets (sometimes not so competent when I placed NBA bets). They didn’t even return my deposits worth 20 000+ €. Hope this complaint can help cbet reconsider, what is a very strange decision from my point of view.</p>
<p>Best regards, boll11</p>
