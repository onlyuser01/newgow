<p>PA Betting Services is looking forward to continuing to provide William Hill with the high-quality service it has come to expect from the supplier</p>
<p>Several months after agreeing to provide DAZN BET with racing data, PA Betting Services announced that it has expanded its existing agreement with the leading gambling operator William Hill. Under the extended deal, the former company will continue to provide the operator with UK and select International Horse Racing Data and UK Greyhound Data.</p>
<p>The content provision includes a variety of race cards, premium vector silks, live betting odds and results, as well as access to the provider’s critically-acclaimed Sports Editorial News Content.</p>
<p>The renewal of the agreement between the two companies will continue their long relationship and will cement PA Betting Services’ position as a best-in-class provider of reliable racing data content to the global betting industry.</p>
<p>At the same time, William Hill will be able to continue providing its customers with unparalleled access to the latest racing information and insights.</p>
<p>Both Companies Are Delighted to Continue Working Together</p>
<p>PA Betting Services’ account director, Niamh Richardson, commented on the agreement, saying that she is thrilled to continue working with William Hill. Richardson said that the two companies’ partnership has been very successful and that William Hill’s decision to continue working with PA Betting Services highlights the accuracy of the latter company’s content.</p>
<p>Richardson concluded that William Hill will continue receiving the cutting-edge products it is used to.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to provide William Hill with the high-quality service they have come to expect from us. Niamh Richardson, account director, PA Betting Services</p>
<p>Simon Kew, William Hill’s director of horse racing P&amp;L, also shared his thoughts on the agreement. He noted that the operator is happy with the opportunity to continue working with PA Betting Services. He noted that the extended deal will secure top-quality racing data and content for the operator’s customers.</p>
<p>Kew noted that the agreement emphasizes William Hill’s desire to provide amazing racing experiences to its customers:</p>
<p>This new agreement supports our commitment to providing our customers with a first-class betting experience. Simon Kew, director of horse racing P&amp;L, William Hill</p>
<p>William Hill was recently slapped with the biggest regulatory settlement ever seen in British gaming. Because of prior failings, the operator, now owned by 888, was required to pay a £19.2 million fine. While the parent company said that it is prepared to pay the sum, the failings themselves revealed an underlying regulatory weakness. Experts fear that these weaknesses are setting a dangerous precedent.</p>
