    <h1>Aria Casino Best New Online Casinos With No Deposit Bonuses Seminole Casino Hollywood Fl No Limit Co</h1>

<p>Casino is unfairly asking for PDF Bank statements.</p>
<p>ive deposited thru Interac etransfer. Around $3000 in the last month. I have made on withdrawal successfully in the amount of $475.</p>
<p>I was lucky and got a nice Win and ended up with around $4000.</p>
<p>i made a withdrawal request and now i am being asked for bank statements. I have no problem sending screenshots in. However, they only want PDF bank statements. These are generated by the bank only once a month. This is extremely unfair towards a player to refuse screenshots of the information. Screenshots should suffice. Iâ€™ve played on many sites and this is not normal. Especially considering it was Interac etransfers used to deposit.</p>
<p>they are deliberately delaying my withdrawal.</p>
