    <h1>Casinos In Reno Lady Luck Casino Hard Rock Tampa Casino Real Casino Games Hollwood Casino SIS and Co</h1>

<p>24-hour live betting service operator, sports news producer, and broadcaster Sports Information Services (SIS) has signed a new partnership expansion with the Spanish multinational gaming group Codere. According to the existing deal between SIS and Codere, SIS is responsible for providing its horse racing content to the operator’s Mexican and Spanish database of customers online. The new contract will now also add Argentina to the list of countries that will benefit from SIS’ top-tier Live Racing Channels available non-stop.</p>
<p>What Should Argentines Expect from the New Partnership Expansion</p>
<p>With the help of the Watch and Bet mode developed by SIS, Codere’s virtual customers from Argentina will be allowed to watch their favorite horse racing events without having to worry about making any bets prior to the start of the events. The Watch and Bet mode is critically important for online sportsbooks looking to constantly beef up their engagement in the complex marketplaces, and Codere can expect to record higher revenues and better rates of engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the partnership expansion will also introduce Argentines to more than 65,000 top-notch, exclusive and live horse racing events spread across 365 days. The list includes the iconic UK and Irish horse races and global meetings from all around the world, including the US, Latin America, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Canada, Dubai, Singapore, and other countries. SIS will cover 165+ horse race tracks and racecourses located on five different continents in total, all available for Argentina’s online market.</p>
<p>Codere will also benefit from daily, short-form content in the form of 20 fresh betting events available per hour. The 24/7 Live Betting Channels that belong to SIS are excellent end-to-end solutions that feature everything from live-streamed images to updated data, complex graphics including betting triggers, and a wide array of available betting markets and the corresponding prices for them.</p>
<p>Codere Is Eager to Offer Quick-Fire Horse Betting Options to Argentina</p>
<p>SIS’s digital sales manager Angel Calderón expressed the company’s plan to continue their close and fruitful long-term partnership with Codere while expanding it in order to deliver their unparalleled global greyhound and horse racing events to the operator’s database of virtual customers in Argentina.</p>
<p>Codere’s supplier relationship manager Borja Mata also stated the operator is delighted to be able to extend their existing partnership with SIS while looking forward to supplying superior horse and greyhound racing offerings to Argentine customers.</p>
<p>Recognizing SIS’s state-of-the-art coverage of the most-watched greyhound and horse racing events on the planet, Codere confidently described the new deal as one that makes “perfect sense”, anticipating the fact that its customers in Argentina will fully harness the multiple quick-fire horse race betting options from over 65,000 live yearly events.</p>
<p>SIS Is Growing at a Strong Pace</p>
<p>Last October, SIS reinforced its presence in South Africa by partnering with Marshalls World of Sport and agreeing to launch a 24/7 live betting channel for South Africans. In November, SIS started a partnership with Betfan in Poland, agreeing to supply it with its esports solutions. The deal was an almost instant hit, quickly and considerably improving Betfan’s fan engagement rates. Soon after, MaxBet launched its complete esports betting solutions with the help of the same SIS solutions as a way of responding to the needs of the constantly increasing number of consumers.</p>
