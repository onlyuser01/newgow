    <h1>Allentown Casino Largest Casino In America Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Codes Casinoes Mount Plea</h1>

<p>It’s time for the first North West Derby in the 2022-23 Premier League. It’s one of the fiercest and longest-running rivalries not only in English soccer but sports in general, with the first-ever Manchester United vs Liverpool being played on April 28, 1894.</p>
<p>The Red Devils from Manchester lead the all-time series with 81 wins, 58 draws, and 70 losses. In recent times, however, the Reds from Liverpool have been the dominant force in the North West Derby. Jurgen Klopp’s men are without a loss to Manchester United in the Premier League since 2018, winning each of their previous three league games.</p>
<p>Are they going to add a fourth EPL win to the list? If you want to see our opinion on the subject, just keep on reading this Man United vs Liverpool preview.</p>

<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>

<p>3:00 PM ET Place: Old Trafford in Manchester</p>
<p>Erik Ten Hag’s Days are Numbered?</p>
<p>Manchester United has had eight different managers in charge since the end of the Alex Ferguson era in 2013. Erik ten Hag is the Red Devils’ boss in the 2022-23 season, but the question is for how long?</p>
<p>Even though Man United hasn’t fired the manager mid-season since the 1970s, betting odds suggest it might happen this time. The odds of Erik ten Hag winning the sack race were +400 before the start of the season but have gone shorter after Man United lost two EPL games.</p>
<p>With a 0-0-2 record after the first two game weeks, the Red Devils are having the worst start to the campaign since the inaugural Premier League season (1992-93). That’s when they also started with two straight losses but went on to win the EPL title in the end. Is there a way the same can happen two decades later?</p>
<p>Probably not, as Manchester United just doesn’t have a good enough roster to challenge for the trophy. Sure, they got a couple of superstars in the team, most notably Cristiano Ronaldo (who wants out, by the way), but they just seem too soft at the back.</p>
<p>Their defense was horrendous last weekend when we saw them concede four goals to Brentford. They were also very disappointing in Round 1 when Brighton beat them 2-1.</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s Men Too Need to Up Their Game</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Manchester United’s horrible form, people would be talking a lot more about Liverpool’s mishaps in the two games of the 2022-23 Premier League season. The Reds, who are among the top title favorites, are still without a win in the Prem, with just two points thus far.</p>
<p>They’ve played two draws so far, which may not seem too horrible, but the thing is that they played against real underdogs. In Round 1, they drew 2-2 with Fulham, a team that played in the Championship last season. In Round 2, they played 1-1 with Crystal Palace at Anfield, the place where they had previously beaten the Eagles three times in a row.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams need to do much better than they have so far. Manchester United will have fans to support them from the stands of Old Trafford, the Premier League’s largest stadium. Unfortunately for them, it’s Liverpool that has better players, as well as a better coach.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
