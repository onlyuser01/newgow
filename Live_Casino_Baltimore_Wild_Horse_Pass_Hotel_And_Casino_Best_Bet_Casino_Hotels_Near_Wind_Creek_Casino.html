<p>US gambling companies are providing tools to gamblers at risk to ban themselves from casino and betting websites.</p>
<p>Betting Companies Offer Self-Ban Solutions</p>
<p>Sportsbook companies are offering solutions for gamblers at risk to exclude themselves from online wagering. Last week, Unibet announced that it is making available to players in the United States a software created by Gamban, a software company based in Southampton, England.</p>
<p>The software solution allows players to block themselves from gambling websites on multiple devices. It bans thousands of gambling websites and constantly updates, adding new ones.</p>
<p>Kindred Group, Unibet’s parent company, said that offering self-blocking software to its customers is a big leap for the industry. Kindred was the first operator to ink a deal with Gamban for the US market. The two companies have established a long-term partnership. They are in collaboration since 2017 for the European and Australian markets.</p>
<p>Gamban’s co-founder, Jack Symons, said that Gamban has tried to achieve this goal since its establishment.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, FanDuel, the largest US gaming provider, inked a partnership with Gamban, as well. Under the deal, players that want to self-exclude will have the ability to make a free Gamban subscription.</p>
<p>Symons stated that FanDuel is making a statement and sets an example to operators to offer self-ban support for their players, who are at risk.</p>
<p>Chief Risk and Compliance Officer with FanDuel Group, Carolyn Renzin, said that educating customers on responsible gambling is the right thing to do. She said that offering Gamban’s software adds a layer of protection to customers and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>At-Risk Gamblers Can Say No</p>
<p>Many states in the US, including New Jersey, offer state-administrated help programs and self-exclusion lists for at-risk gamblers where vulnerable gamblers can go and sign up to ban themselves from gambling for fixed periods or indefinitely. While they are on the list, sportsbook companies and casinos are not allowed to accept bets from them or send them promotions.</p>
<p>Gamblers at risk have these options offered by most licensed casino sites and sportsbook companies. Compulsive players can pause or completely stop their gaming as they have their accounts blocked for “cool-down” periods or permanently.</p>
<p>Executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, Keith Whyte, expressed his support of problem gamblers excluding themselves at operators’ sites and their personal devices. He stated that self-blocking is only a part of the problem gambling network solution. Every state needs prevention, education, research enforcement, treatment, and recovery services.</p>
