<p>With the new year, suppliers have sought to leave their mark on the industry through a rapid succession of quick market and product deployments. The latest such development comes from Play’n GO’s corner, an established studio and author of a series of authentic and unmatched slot games in the industry. The company’s acclaimed release, Gargantoonz, will be introduced exclusively with Rush Street Interactive in North America before it’s made available to partners locally and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The game, which was originally introduced in November 30, will now debut on the iGaming market in the United States through an exclusive partnership with Rush Street Interactive, and will be deployed on the latter’s BetRivers brand across several states, including New Jersey, Michigan, and West Virginia, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release. The partnership will grant BetRivers exclusivity over the game in the country for the month of February, before Gargantoonz becomes available to all other network partners in March.</p>
<p>The opportunity was welcomed by Play’n GO Commercial Director for North America Magnus Natt och Dag who hailed the significance of this move and the opportunity to introduce one of the most promising titles of the year locally in the United States, and with BetRivers of all brands.</p>
<p>"Gargantoonz has gotten off to an impressive start in other jurisdictions around the world since its release late last year, and we’re confident that players in the US will enjoy the game every bit as much," he added.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has had much to report of late, as the company has been able to celebrate the single most successful month in its history. Although details weren’t too clear on the specific financial performance, Play’n GO hailed December 2023 as its most significant single-month operation, seeing a record number of played rounds and gross gaming revenue without imparting the exact numbers.</p>
<p>The company similarly continued with its quick production pace, introducing Moon Princess: Power of Love at the end of January, and adding to the acclaimed and player-favorite genre loosely inspired by the Sailor Moon anime. The company also started the year by introducing a brand new slot about pandas with Pandastic Adventure focusing on both thematic as well as mechanical excellence.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Gargantoonz and its release in the United States, Play’n GO is hoping to improve on a number of its most recent milestones and achievements.</p>
