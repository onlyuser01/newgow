<p>Hello dear Team,</p>
<p>On September 2nd, I took a 100% wager-free bonus at Vasy. I deposited 30 Euros and played with 60 Euros.</p>
<p>I quickly climbed to 1900 Euros. It was a wager-free bonus, so I cancelled it and requested a withdrawal of 1700 Euros. I then had an amount of just under 200 Euros left in my account.</p>
<p>In the account menu, the amount was listed under "Real Money". Hence, no active bonus is left anymore.</p>
<p>I continued playing with the remaining money and even made one or two bonus buys.</p>
<p>Now, the withdrawal has been cancelled and all winnings are gone. Only the 30 Euros I had deposited are left on my account.</p>
<p>In an email I received today, it was stated that I exceeded the max bet of 4 Euros and therefore the money is gone.</p>
<p>This counts as long as the bonus is active. But since the bonus has been cancelled and converted into real money, the bonus is no longer active for me. While the bonus was active, I never exceeded the 4 Euro max bet.</p>
<p>According to the log, the withdrawal was cancelled on September 2nd at 8:06 pm. The request for withdrawal was around 10:06 pm. Unfortunately, I can't see that anymore. The first buy was around 10:16 pm with "Real Money". I am wondering, how can the cancellation be at that time?</p>
<p>I have taken screenshots of the game history and the chat.</p>
<p>I hope you can possibly assist me on this.</p>
<p>Best regards, Dennis</p>
