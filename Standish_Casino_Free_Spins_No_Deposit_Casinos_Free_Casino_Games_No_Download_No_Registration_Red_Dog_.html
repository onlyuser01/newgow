    <h1>Standish Casino Free Spins No Deposit Casinos Free Casino Games No Download No Registration Red Dog</h1>

<p>Let me clarify the situation once again.</p>
<p>The bonus was active and I was planning to wager the bonus at live game. At that moment I didn't know that it's not possible. When I realized bonus can't be wagered at live games I asked to cancel the bonus by support. But suddenly I have been told that in accordance to the bonus rules when doing bets at ANY game (including live) all winnings come to bonus account not to real money account. And following that rule at that point I already didn't have any real money but only bonus money. If I canceled the bonus all the bonus amount would be withheld and I would have 0. So what to do? I had about 3500USD or so on my 'bonus account' (actually it was still my money but vavada moved them to bonus account).</p>
<p>No ANY restrictions to play ANY games were raised to me yet I contacted support so many times on the matter. So I continued to play Blackjack decided if I loose - Ok, but if I win I will wager the bonus at slots later. So I did. At what point I got 'unfair advantage'? I didn't have intention to get any advantage from bonus and clearly asked to CANCEL the bonus but vavada strictly rejected my claim.</p>
<p>Like you said - there are no any software restrictions playing live games with active bonus. There are no any verbal restrictions from support or T&amp;C. And secondly all my winning bets from live game have been moved to BONUS account by vavada - I played live game, I won some bets but all winnings went to bonus account. And now I am accused in using 'bonus' funds? Do I get you right?</p>
<p>If live game not connected to bonus program - why this happened? Vavada told me this rule is for ANY game I play. There were no any restrictions raised to my live BJ game when bonus active. Wager contribution from live game is ZERO but winnings go to bonus account. From my point of view here casino not me gained 'unfair advantage' having moved my real cash to bonus account and now saying I used 'bonus' funds. How is that possible?</p>
<p>There is no clear warning or statement that I can wager bonus at SLOTS only or live game with active bonus is restricted on vavada T&amp;C. How to know this? On the contrary they told me to feel free play ANY games. And all winning bets from ANY game go to BONUS account - this is UNFAIR! When I knew it all my funds became "bonus funds' already and I became the hostage of this casino do you understand this?</p>
<p>Vavada accepted all my live BJ bets, vavada moved all my winning live BJ bets from real to bonus account - seeing no problem with my BJ game, rejected my claim to cancel the bonus and finally accused in using bonus funds? Really? If I cant't wager the bonus at live games then I shall got my live BJ winnings bets to real money account isn't it?</p>
<p>As for my blackjack 'winnings' as you said - there is a game history by game provider. Following Evolution data total BJ game resulted in a loss of -1500 USD (or so). No matter what funds I used - I put 8000USD in and got 6500USD back. What 'blackjack winnings' are you talking about?</p>
<p>Now they or you changed version again, started from 'opposite bets' accusations from game provider, continued with 'card counting' accusations from vavada, followed by 'bonus hunting' accusations from casino guru. What is my fault finally?</p>
<p>Matej, please clarify - this thoughts about 'bonus rules violation' is from your own or this is from vavada? And also the question why casino don't answer in public but communicating with you somewhere else?</p>
