<p>The most exciting duel of the first round of the 2023-24 Premier League is the clash between Chelsea and Liverpool, which is taking place at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, August 13</p>
<p>Each of the last three Chelsea vs. Liverpool duels finished with no goals in 90 minutes. Those include two EPL games played in 2023. This time, however, we could see some goals. Why? Because both teams look very good in the attacking department right now.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Liverpool Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Chelsea +190 Draw +240 Liverpool +138</p>
<p>Totals Odds Over 2.5 -149 Under 2.5 +120</p>

<p>Mauricio Pochettino Making His Debut as Chelsea Boss</p>
<p>The former manager of Tottenham, Mauricio Pochettino is making his debut at the helm of Chelsea this Sunday. He did lead the Blues in a couple of friendlies this summer, which served as a dress rehearsal for the new Premier League season.</p>
<p>His team looked good in those games, especially in the offense. It’s no surprise because Chelsea has some really decent forwards in 2023. Raheem Sterling is there, along with Hakim Ziyech, Christopher Nkunku, and Mykhailo Mudryk.</p>
<p>All of those guys are wingers with incredible pace and amazing dribbling skills. What’s interesting is that in the 2023-24 season, the role of the central forward will be (probably) given to 22-year-old Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson.</p>
<p>He’s a tall and powerful striker who came to Stamford Bridge from Villarreal, for which he scored 12 goals in 26 matches last season.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s Offense Looking Incredible in 2023</p>
<p>The Reds have big ambitions for the 2023-24 season, which is no surprise given that their roster looks incredible. Their offense looks particularly good, with players like Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota, Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz, and others. With such players, the Reds seem capable of scoring against literally any opponent in the world.</p>
<p>However, Liverpool’s midfield doesn’t look as great. Sure, the Reds have made a couple of decent signings to strengthen the midfield, with Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai arriving during the summer transfer period.</p>
<p>However, Fabinho has left Liverpool for Saudi Arabia, while two other midfielders – Thiago and Stefan Bajcetic – are injured and will miss the Chelsea game.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs. Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Unlike the last couple of Chelsea vs. Liverpool duels, the one on Sunday is almost guaranteed to be a real barnburner. Liverpool looks great offensively, but the Reds are soft in the middle, which is why they probably won’t be the ones to control the game. That said, Chelsea will almost certainly create lots of goal chances, and we believe some of them will go in.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea and Liverpool to draw; both teams to score</p>
