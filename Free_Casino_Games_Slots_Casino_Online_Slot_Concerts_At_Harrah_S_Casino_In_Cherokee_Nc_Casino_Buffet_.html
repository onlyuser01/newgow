<p>Genius Sports has released In-Play MultiBet, a fresh betting product that will become available to sportsbooks and bettors right before the start of the FIFA World Cup in November.</p>
<p>What Does In-Play MultiBet Bring New to the Table?</p>
<p>The new product is a live, same-game accumulator wagering tool powered by Artificial Intelligence. It will enable bettors to wager on multiple events during a single match. This means they will be given the opportunity to place a bet after every touchdown, goal, and event during intervals as soon as the match has begun. Bettors looking forward to getting better control over their bets should find the new product interesting. At the same time, sportsbooks looking to improve their turnover and margin can also use the same-game parlay betting product to draw in more customers.</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ In-Play MultiBet product will be tested on November 20, the day when the FIFA World Cup will start. The event in Qatar will mark the 22nd running of the prestigious FIFA World Cup competition and it will end on December 18. The company powering the ecosystem that reunites technology with sports, media, and betting will make its new product accessible to a large number of leagues. The list includes the Liga MX, the English Premier League, the National Football League, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), and the International Volleyball Federation leagues, among others.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed company’s chief commercial officer Jack Davison spoke about the new release, explaining how it mixes “same-game parlays with the unstoppable growth of in-play betting.” Davison also called it a “breakthrough innovation” for both the company and all of its partners. The CCO further added that the new product will enable partners to “drive engagement” between brakes and important events during matches while unlocking greater margins.</p>
<p>September, a Busy Month for Genius Sports</p>
<p>At the beginning of September, Genius Sports also secured a fresh partnership with MaximBet. The new deal will provide the constantly expanding sportsbook in the US with a series of LiveData, LiveTrading, and PreMatch options available for thousands of events throughout the year. The partnership included official content driven by data for the NFL, Basketball, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, the English Premier League, and the Mid-American Conference Football part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I.</p>
<p>During the same month, Genius Sports also released the free-to-play Pick Six game together with Caesars Entertainment and the Indianapolis Colts. Genius Sports also agreed to power MaximBet with its sports betting solutions, while officially launching with NorthStar Bets in Canada during the same month.</p>
