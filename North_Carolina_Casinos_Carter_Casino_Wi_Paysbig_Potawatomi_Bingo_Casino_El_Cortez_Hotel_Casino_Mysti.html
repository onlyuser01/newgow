    <h1>North Carolina Casinos Carter Casino Wi Paysbig Potawatomi Bingo Casino El Cortez Hotel Casino Mysti</h1>

<p>The man, arrested earlier this week, is facing more than two dozen charges and has served sentences for similar crimes before</p>
<p>A man, who is believed to be involved in a series of casino robberies was arrested earlier this week and booked into the Clark County Detention Center (CCDC) in Las Vegas, Nevada, on multiple charges including robbery with a deadly weapon, burglary and more. The man, identified by the police as Dshante Styles, is allegedly involved in six different robberies that occurred at casinos dating back to November.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officer identified one vehicle that was believed to be used by Styles for one of the casino robberies. During this encounter, the suspect was able to flee police authorities. However, the encounter helped police officials successfully identify Styles.</p>
<p>Consequently, he was arrested by law enforcement Thursday. Upon his arrest, police officers from the Major Violators Bureau uncovered a gun in Styles’ possession. The alleged robber, labeled as “brazen,” faces more than two dozen charges. The charges against Styles include five counts of grand larceny auto, 11 counts of burglary with a deadly weapon, two counts of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, as well as six counts of robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>The Suspect Was Previously Sentenced for Similar Crimes</p>
<p>The arrest of the brazen suspect comes after a months-long investigation considering that the casino robberies started on November 16, 2022. Different law enforcement agencies joined forces to investigate eight separate robberies, allegedly involving Styles.</p>
<p>Six of the armed robberies involved casino properties, while the remaining two involved carjackings. In the course of the investigation, police authorities found the person involved in those crimes was incredibly bold.</p>
<p>“Styles has a long history of being a dangerous criminal and had previously served a prison sentence for the same type of crimes, including a conviction for robbery in 2008 out of Nevada and two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon in 2009 out of Nevada.“ Nick Farese, deputy chief of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</p>
<p>Nick Farese, LVMPD’s deputy chief, announced details regarding the arrest of the alleged casino robber. He explained that Styles has previously committed similar crimes. Moreover, Farese pointed out that the alleged serial casino robber was previously convicted in 2008 as well as 2009.</p>
<p>Given that the investigation is still ongoing, LVMPD’s deputy chief did not disclose which casinos were victims of the robber. Farese added that police believe that Styles was responsible for all of the robberies that initially started in November. The deputy chief thanked the law enforcement officers for their dedication and efforts in this investigation.</p>
