    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Pa Casino On Fremont Street Online Free Casino Fanduel Casino Promo Code Coolcat C</h1>

<p>I have registered betmaster casino on 13th May 2023. Passed primary verification. Played few days in a row and total deposits reached 8300 usdt (total 5 deposits). So I was on a very tough down streak (nobody cared in casino) and I was loosing all the bets. Nonetheless by the end of the day 16th May and during 17th May things changed and I broke even and won a little. Total balance reached 10597.53 usdt (8300 usdt of that amount were my deposits).</p>
<p>I tried to arrange first withdrawal in the amount just 600 usdt (that was the limit). Casino asked to pass extended verification and requested a lot of documents including those provided earlier. A lot of different selfies were requeseted (3 or 4 types of selfies with different stuff at my back, like support chat, crypto-wallet, ID etc). I have presented all this in full. This took a lot of time as they were constantly complaining on the quality and I had to retake the selfies again.</p>
<p>After all, they told me they perform account verification for 5 working days from the day of receival of last requested document (dated 24th May) and I agreed to that when accepted their T&amp;C.</p>
<p>I found this clause '5.23. Verification process usually may take up to 5 business days, in rare cases longer than this'. So in 'rare cases' it can take forever and I 'agreed' to that.</p>
<p>Anyway 5 business days ended May 30th. I got no messages from them. All my withdrawal requests declined (as of account 'not verified' status I think).</p>
<p>Up to this moment account not FULLY verified, no further requests came from casino and no withdrawal requests served. It's dragging since May, 17th. I ask help of your project in withdrawing the balance from betmaster casino!</p>
