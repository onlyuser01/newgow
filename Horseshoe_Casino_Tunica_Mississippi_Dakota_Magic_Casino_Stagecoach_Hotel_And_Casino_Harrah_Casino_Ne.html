<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>At first glance, the game is expected to feature a classic Oriental soundtrack with specific music accompaniment to complement the graphics and overall theme. However, the developer picked a playful type of music that is more engaging and danceable and less calming and soothing than one would expect. Plus, the music does not truly sound like Chinese music, even though its unusualness does an excellent job at attract the attention of players.</p>
<p>Make You Rich Gameplay</p>
<p>Similar to the rest of the Dragon Gaming slots, Make You Rich has simple gameplay rules that are easy to follow by both experienced players and newbies who are just getting familiarized with the world of online slots.

<p>Make You Rich: Ingot Collector, Mega Spins &amp; Buy Feature</p>
<p>The game does not introduce players to any of the standard bonus features that are normally found with most video slots. This means that while there aren’t any free spins and expanding wilds to be looking for, players can still enjoy an extra Ingot Collector round. They are also given the choice to use the Bonus Buy Feature and jump straight into the middle of the action.</p>
<p>Ingot Collector Feature</p>

In order to engage the Mega Spins round, players must come across a minimum of three identical symbols, and their string of winnings should not suffer any interruptions.</p>
<p>The bonus consists of a series of five games with a 5x bet multiplier. All spins guarantee a win while the reels will spin with the bet that the player has chosen to place prior to the start of the bonus session. The Mega Spins round is, therefore, played using the same rules as the ines sued to play the base game. It also consists of the same symbols, with the difference that these symbols are now upgraded and they are worth five times the original value. The bonus feature will come to an end once the five winning spins are over.</p>
<p>Bonus Buy Feature</p>
<p>Players who would like to start taking advantage of the Ingot feature straight away, with zero delays, can take advantage of the available bonus buy feature to do it. They are given the opportunity to either buy all three ingots simultaneously or limit their purchase to the ingots ones that they are currently missing so they can fill out the collector for 82x max bet.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
