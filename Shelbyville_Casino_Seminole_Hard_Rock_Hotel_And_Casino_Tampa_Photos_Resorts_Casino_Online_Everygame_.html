<p>Yggdrasil’s new Ancient Greece-themed slots features symbols such as the standard Jack through Ace. Different combinations of those symbols deliver low-paying prizes, but the game offers more chances to win higher prizes. Higher-paying symbols include a ring with a gem, a golden chalice, as well as female and male characters.</p>
<p>Elysian Jackpots delivers quality sound effects and features a colorful background. The slot stands out with vibrant colors and quality design. The background of the game changes depending on the game mode, while the reel itself is positioned in the center of the screen surrounded by an outline resembling an ancient Greek building.</p>
<p>Jackpots, Free Spins and Treasure Chest Bonus</p>
<p>Whenever a player lands three scatter symbols, they enter a bonus game called Treasure Chest. This mini-game grants the players an option to “try to successfully open at least three boxes without a boulder falling on top of them, unlocking exciting rewards,” explains Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to trigger one of the game’s jackpots, players need to match five gems that have the same color during the game’s Free Spins round. The Free Spins are activated by collecting five keys with identical color gems or by hitting three, four or five scatter symbols during the base gameplay.</p>
<p>Entering the Free Spins round with scatter symbols awards the players with a 3x win multiplier, granting a chance for even higher payouts. During the Free Spins round, the players need to match five gems to win one out of five different jackpots.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Elysian Jackpots offers a feature called Pick &amp; Click. This bonus feature is activated whenever a player lands two scatter symbols on the reels. This grants the players a chance to select one out of five vases that can award keys, cash prizes or Free Spins mode.</p>
