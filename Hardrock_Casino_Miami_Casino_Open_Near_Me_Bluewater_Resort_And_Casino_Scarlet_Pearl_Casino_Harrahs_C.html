    <h1>Hardrock Casino Miami Casino Open Near Me Bluewater Resort And Casino Scarlet Pearl Casino Harrahs C</h1>

<p>Hello Casino Guru Team,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as is almost always the case, if you win more than you deposited, the casino will try everything to prevent it.</p>
<p>really, they're looking for crumbs, they're held out and testimony against testimony (internally at the casino).</p>
<p>11/11/2022 Registration</p>
<p>11.11.-02.12.2022 paid in about 2000€</p>
<p>12/02/2022 I win 3690€</p>
<p>12/02/2022 Verification starts</p>
<p>02.12.-07.12.2022 approx. 30 documents (I've never had anything like this!!!)</p>
<p>12/07/2022 Confirmation email Account verified</p>
<p>12/07/2022 Live Chat says GO! Account verified: make a withdrawal</p>
<p>"Attention only bank possible!!!" although I also asked for a chip (was also a deposit)! No only bank!</p>
<p>12/07/2022 Payouts no matter which ones, all canceled! No email nothing!</p>
<p>07.12-08.12.2022 honestly 6-7 live chats</p>
<p>document is missing...</p>
<p>08.12.2022 live chat no. XX Support only says €500 token payout per day!</p>
<p>Payout started - he says in the chat wait a minute - fits - payout 1 came.</p>
<p>12/08/2022 further payment for the next day already created</p>
<p>12/09/2022 seen, payment canceled relatively late, so nothing. Then again 3-4 chats needed until one time no auto - answers had sent, said wait. Zack - payment made.</p>
<p>09.12.2022 Payout requested (for Monday / because nothing happened at the weekend...</p>
<p>12/10/2022 further payment requested</p>
<p>11.12.2022 none requested</p>
<p>12/12/2022 further payment requested</p>
<p>12/13/2022 further payment requested</p>
<p>at least 15 chats since 09.12.-13.12.2022</p>
<p>started...always the same...just automatic replies.</p>
<p>€500 per day withdrawal limit (although Jeton could withdraw up to €4000)</p>
<p>A payout can take up to 3 days</p>
<p>Payouts are processed one after the other and you couldn't speed things up, the question is why did it work immediately the first two times?!?!</p>
<p>today is the 3rd day - currently 4x 500€ in the payout queue</p>
<p>had set limits via chat since December 2nd, 2022, thus preventing further play!</p>
<p>Already 4 chats today and everyone said: "I'll send a message to Finance, they should please speed it up!" very strange.</p>
<p>nothing happened!</p>
<p>how is that supposed to work with daily payouts of up to €500? If they always cancel the waiting ones, so that you have to start all over again so that they win 3 days again?!? 3+3 = 6 days so only 1 per week possible?!</p>
<p>What I don't understand, with such behavior - you scare the players away, I can easily count on at least almost 20 hours of extra work that I've needed so far to push something forward.</p>
<p>I kept all chats scripts and daily screenshots.</p>
<p>whatever you need - I can supply it.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>love from</p>
