    <h1>Casino Kings Mountain Nc Aria Resort Casino Prices Club World Casino Ruby Fortune Casino Online Casi</h1>

<p>I have been on a losing streak since I started at this casino. Nothing new, because I have experienced them before. My first couple deposits I did not use any bonuses because of high play through. These last 2 deposits, I did use a bonus to help me out. I didn’t deposit much because I have been on such a bad streak that I didn’t want to spend more than I had to. Well, with my bonus I started off with about 118 dollars. I was down to 74 real quick because I was betting 3 dollars a spin. I noticed the top row had 7x , cat, cat. I sat there for a minute and said naw. I just hit and it didn’t pay. I took a screenshot and thought maybe Im just wrong. So I spun again. This time it was bottom row owl, owl, owl. What just happened? I just hit twice and it didn’t pay. So I took another screenshot and I stopped playing. I spoke to live agent and he advised me to email since I couldn’t put screenshots on screen. I told him I would. So I sent emails. I told live agent I had sent two emails since the screenshots were too big to put on one email. I asked him was it ok to keep going with a different game of course and he said yes since I didn’t have anything pending. Well as you can imagine, it didn’t take me long to lose the rest of the 70 dollars. Well I check my email and I see an answer to my screenshots. Customer Service said they had to be all matching in a row to be a win. He said it wasn’t a win. I emailed him back and asked what pictures he was looking at because clearly it is three in a row. His next email was that it had been forwarded to the gaming department. My questions are, How long do I wait for an answer because when I have inquired about it, I have been brushed off. Also, how long has this been happening without me noticing? Is that why Im on a losing streak? So I got screenshots of both wins and I have screenshots of all my playing history to show that I have been losing a lot. Not sure if they go hand and hand but I would love to hear some good answers.</p>
