<p>Buster’s Bones review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Buster’s Bones is a dog-themed slot game from industry veterans, NetEnt. The slot combines a canine theme with the Wild West, with the game being about a group of dogs on the hunt for bones and riches in a dusty old canyon.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>NetEnt has put together a really charming slot game with Buster’s Bones. The slot’s backdrop is a well-designed canyon with the sun setting over the top. The reels are held together by a set of wooden frames, with the symbols being made up of a collection of adorable pooches in various pieces of Western-inspired attire.</p>
<p>This is all complemented by an upbeat soundtrack that feels as though it could have been taken from an old cartoon.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Buster’s Bones slot has a 6x6 game grid, and it uses a cluster-pay mechanic. Winning combinations are formed of five or more matching symbols landing in a cluster.</p>
<p>Like other cluster-pay slots, the game has an Avalanche winning mechanic. Whenever a player lands a win, the symbols will disappear from the grid, and new ones will fall into their place. This continues until no new clusters are formed.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The slot is all about helping dogs get their bones, and this is the basis for one of the main features. Buster’s Bones occurs when a Buster symbol lands at the same time as a Bone symbol. Buster will have a multiplier, and he will go around the reels collecting each Bone and turning it Wild. He will also collect the value of the bone and add it to his overall multiplier. New wins are then calculated.</p>
<p>On any random spin, the Random Features bonus can trigger. This adds up to five Bone symbols and a Buster symbol to the reels.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest bonus is the Buster’s Bones Free Spins round. This is triggered when you land two Scatter symbols and the Buster symbol. Players get eight spins. During the round, Buster stays on the reels and collects throughout. His multiplier continues to increase as he collects. One or two Scatters will trigger an additional one or three spins.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you may be able to trigger the Free Spins bonus with the Buy Feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Buster’s Bones slot doesn’t offer much winning potential. It offers 973x the player’s stake as a maximum win, which is much lower than you can find in other NetEnt slots. The RTP sits just above average at 96.07%. The slot is considered medium/high on the volatility scale by Play’n Go.</p>
<p>The stake is adjusted by the stack of coins icon, with the minimum wager being $0.10 and the maximum being $200, giving this a very big betting range. This will allow you to adjust your slot strategy accordingly as you play.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>There is no denying that Buster’s Bones looks great, and if you’re a fan of cute, animal-themed slots, then you may find some enjoyment here. We were also fans of the Buster’s Bones bonus feature. Unfortunately, the slot offers very little winning potential in comparison to other top online slots, and this lets it down in the long run.</p>
