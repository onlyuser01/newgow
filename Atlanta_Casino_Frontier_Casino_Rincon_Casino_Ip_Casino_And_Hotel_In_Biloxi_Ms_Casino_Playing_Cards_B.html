<p>Betsson Deploys RAW Content to Fleet of Sites</p>
<p>Betsson is doubling down on its efforts to expand its reach with local audiences and provide them with the excellent content that they have come to expect from the group’s brands. This partnership is a multi-brand alliance that will see many of RAW’s proprietary features delivered to the casinos, including the SuperTracks and SuperSlice games.</p>
<p>Popular choices that will be made available are Joker &amp; The Thief, and SuperTracks Railways. There are also more mechanics planned out by the company, which include SuperStretch and SuperSymbols which are designed to bring even more worthwhile and rewarding experiences to fans. RAW CEO Tom Wood, who used to work with Betsson Group, was happy to welcome this new opportunity and highlight its significance for both partners:</p>
<p>We are extremely excited about releasing our content on one of Europe’s premier gaming destinations. Being a former Betssonite, this brings a lot of joy to me personally to release games with the Betsson Group. RAW CEO Tom Wood</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Betsson head of supplier relationships Laura Peretta was thrilled with the opportunity to see RAW’s content hit the shelves at the group’s numerous gaming brands. Thanks to RAW, Peretta believes that Betsson would be able to differentiate its content offer thanks to the arrival of the new games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, RAW has been busy expanding both its regional presence, but also adding to its library of games. RAW is a powerful aggregator that has been adding new titles and features to help power up the offer of various websites.</p>
