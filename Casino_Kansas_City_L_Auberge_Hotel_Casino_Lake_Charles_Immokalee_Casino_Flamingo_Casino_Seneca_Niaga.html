<p>Rantala will instead serve as chairman of Rootz’s board of directors</p>
<p>Rootz, a provider of solutions to the iGaming industry, unveiled a major transition in its executive leadership. As announced by the company, Rootz’s co-founder and CEO, Lasse Rantala, will be stepping down from his position. Rantala will be succeeded by Sam Brown, the company’s current chief commercial officer.</p>
<p>Rootz was founded in 2018 and quickly grew to be a leading iGaming platform provider. Thanks to the efficiency of its solutions, the company grew and formed alliances with multiple gambling companies.</p>
<p>Lasse Rantala was instrumental in this growth, laying a robust foundation for the company. His leadership nurtured Rootz’s success and helped the company emerge as a major supplier. Luckily, Rootz will continue to benefit from Rantala’s guidance as he transfers to chair of the board of directors.</p>
<p>In his new position, Rantala will continue using his savvy to guide Rootz’s initiatives and drive further growth for the company.</p>
<p>Rantala’s successor, Sam Brown, joined the company as CCO a year ago. Despite being fairly new to the company, Brown boasts more than 15 years of experience in the iGaming sector. His impressive track record includes positions at many high-profile companies, earning him much respect in the industry.</p>
<p>As CEO, Brown will be tasked with solidifying Rootz’s position as a major iGaming provider.</p>
<p>Rantala Believes Rootz Is in Good Hands</p>
<p>Rantala shared that he trusts Brown to be a worthy successor. He said that the new CEO’s commitment to excellence, strategic mindset and passion for innovation made him a perfect candidate to become Rootz’s new CEO.</p>
<p>I have full faith in his ability to steer our company to even greater heights and the Board is fully dedicated to offering him unwavering support every step of the way. Lasse Rantala, CEO, Rootz</p>
<p>Brown also commented on the matter, sharing his thoughts on his new position. He said that his first year with the company has been a blast and that his passion for the business is now stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Brown is looking forward to supporting Rootz’s vision and ambition and helping the company enter a new phase of its journey.</p>
<p>After an exciting first year at Rootz my passion for the business has only grown stronger. We have a great vision for the future, and have the people, technology, and ambition to deliver it. It’s an honor to be entrusted with the next phase of the Rootz journey. Sam Brown, CCO, Rootz</p>
<p>In May, Rootz secured content from Octoplay, a passionate provider of slot games. Around the same time, the company added Air Dice to its roster of casino game providers.</p>
