<p>Boyd Gaming Corporation and FanDuel Group have plans to resurrect the famous Las Vegas Strip resort Stardust in a real-money online casino brand.</p>
<p>Expected Stardust Casino Launch Is Currently Set for April</p>
<p>FanDuel and Boyd Gaming Corporation announced their plans to launch a shared venture with the Stardust-branded online casino in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The duo expects to launch the Stardust casino in April following final regulatory approval from each state. FanDuel’s existing Betfair Casino is part of the agreement and will be re-launched under the Stardust brand in Pennsylvania. In both states, there will be a single app available for both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Keith Smith, president, and chief executive officer of Boyd Gaming, stated that even though the Stardust resort has been gone for more than ten years, the brand remains as popular as ever as it was one of the most famous casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>“We are excited to work with our partners at FanDuel to launch our first real-money online casinos and are confident this legendary brand will give us a significant advantage in connecting with players looking for a distinctive online gaming experience,” Smith added.</p>
<p>Stardust Casino to Use FanDuel’s Apps and Player Account Management System</p>
<p>The Stardust Casino will utilize FanDuel’s signature front-end design, player account management system, and apps. Players in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey will have the opportunity to earn B Connected points and tier credits from Boyd Gaming’s B Connected player loyalty program and use them on the Stardust casino.</p>
<p>The new Stardust casino will provide a few major features like a variety of popular player favorites, including slots, video poker, roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and live dealer games, along with the safety and security that customers associate with FanDuel. Additional account protection will be available to players as part of Boyd Gaming and FanDuel’s common commitment to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>FanDuel Group’s president Amy Howe reassured players that the new Stardust Casino would retain the bulk of Betfair’s gaming portfolio and player-favorite titles. This will come with a new look that will reflect the “glitz, glamour, and nostalgia” of old Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Stardust Casino allows us to take a market-leading product to the next level, creating a unified platform across New Jersey and Pennsylvania and integrating Boyd Gaming’s B Connected player loyalty program to provide even more value to our customers” said Howe.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming’s Stardust Social Casino Is Available throughout the Country</p>
<p>Following regulatory approval, players will be able to download the Stardust Casino app on iOS and Android or via the casino website. Customers will have the option to log in using their existing FanDuel fantasy/sportsbook login details in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania and their existing Betfair Casino credentials in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Currently, the FanDuel Sportsbook &amp; Casino app is available in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Michigan, and while players are required to be in New Jersey or Pennsylvania in order to access the real-money Stardust Casino, Boyd Gaming’s Stardust Social Casino is available throughout the whole country. The Stardust Social casino app is free and can be downloaded on Google Play or Apple.</p>
