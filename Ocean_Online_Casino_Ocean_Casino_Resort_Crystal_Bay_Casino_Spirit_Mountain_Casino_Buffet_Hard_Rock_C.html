<p>It’s time for the final week of the Premier League before the 2022 World Cup break. Round 16 of the 2022-23 EPL is on the program this coming weekend, which brings us a couple of interesting matchups. Arguably the most interesting matchup of the round is Newcastle vs Chelsea.</p>
<p>The Magpies are without a loss since August and are on a four-win streak at the moment. The result is that they’re now sitting in the no.3 position in the Premier League standings – their best placement in years.</p>
<p>The Blues were high in the EPL table until recently. However, after two straight losses, they’ve dropped to the no.7 place.</p>

<p>Newcastle Going for Their Fifth Straight Win</p>
<p>August 31 – that’s the date when Newcastle lost a game the last time. It happened at Anfield against Liverpool, who won 2-1. Since then, the Magpies are 6-3-0 in the Prem. Further, they are undefeated at home – St. James’ Park – since April.</p>
<p>They’re great in literally all areas of play. Their offense is third-most productive in the Premier League with 27 goals in 14 games. Their defense is even better – with 0.78 goals conceded per game, they’re the best in the league.</p>
<p>What makes Newcastle so great in 2022 is that these guys play like a real team. There are no big superstars on the roster, but every player does his part the best he can. As a result, 50% of their players have scored at least one goal in the 2022-23 EPL season.</p>
<p>Chelsea Looking for Their First EPL Win in Almost a Month</p>
<p>Graham Potter started his Chelsea tenure in top gear. His team won the first three EPL games since he got in charge. However, the Blues then hit a rough patch. First, they played a draw against Brentford and Manchester United. Then, they lost to Brighton (Potter’s former team) and Arsenal.</p>
<p>They did, however, do very well on the continent, securing a spot in the Champions League knockouts in 2023 – they’re gonna play against Dortmund in the Round of 16.</p>
<p>The problem is that in the Prem, they’re now seventh, with just two points more than Liverpool, Fulham, and Crystal Palace. All three of those teams could leapfrog them if they lose to Newcastle on Saturday.</p>
<p>Newcastle vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Confidence is high among Newcastle’s players, who are going to be on the front foot on Saturday. They don’t feel threatened by the Blues, which is why we expect them to start attacking from the very first moment.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean their tactic will play off. The Blues are a talented bunch, with plenty of players who know how to fight back. That said, we expect to see a real thriller at St. James’ Park, with goals on both sides. But which team will score more? We think neither.</p>
<p>Pick: Newcastle and Chelsea to draw</p>
