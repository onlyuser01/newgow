    <h1>Wild Rose Casino Clinton Casino Hotels In Atlantic City Las Vegas Strip Casino Map Hard Rock Casino</h1>

<p>The end-to-end gaming software provider that creates in-house game elements Stakelogic Live has agreed to expand an existing partnership with Dutch casino operator Kansino, formerly known as Batavia Casino. The terms of the new deal include the addition of the fresh Stakelogic Live Dealer gallery of games to the operator’s offerings for players.</p>
<p>Stakelogic and Kansino Plan to Take Their Partnership to the Next Level</p>
<p>Skatelogic Live’s fruitful partnership with the Dutch operator that belongs to Play North Limited has been fueled by the developer’s modern-day video and classic slots since October 2021. These games helped Dutch players enjoy state-of-the-art experiences online.</p>
<p>In an attempt to take their success to a whole new level, the two groups expanded their collaboration by adding Stakelogic’s live dealer titles to the deal. Players who were already used to the rich selection consisting of more than 900 games provided by Kansino will now benefit from Dutch-speaking, branded table games, and live dealer casino games.</p>
<p>The fresh games are expected to help Kansino differentiate its library from that of its direct competitors in the country and try to achieve greater retention rates. Batvia Casino changed its name to Kansino as of February 17, 2022, after the company behind it, Play North, concluded that players considered the name Batvia too confusing.</p>
<p>The selection of new live dealer games is versatile and includes the hottest attractions for casino aficionados, ranging from roulette and auto roulette variants, baccarat, blackjack, and popular game shows. Kansino’s head of casino Daphne Xerri said the group was focused on providing the best gaming experiences online to Dutch players. To do this, Kansino aims to provide them with a rich plethora of games from the most reputable developers in the industry.</p>
<p>The new affiliation with Stakelogic’s branded live dealer titles is an important step towards this goal. Xerri also acknowledged that Stakelogic Live’s dealer games are some of the highest-rated titles on the market while expressing the group’s eagerness to directly provide them to their own players.</p>
<p>What Can Dutch Players Expect From the Expansion?</p>
<p>A number of action-packed Dutch-speaking brand tables displaying the Kansino logo will also be integrated into the virtual lobby, as part of the new partnership. All tables will be placed in front of a luxurious casino-themed backdrop and they will be operated by expert casino dealers with a lot of experience under their belts.</p>
<p>The dealers will be able to freely engage with players in Dutch, thus eliminating any language barriers that Dutch players might have had in the past when accessing live dealer games online. The dealers, who have undergone serious training, will carefully guide players through the adrenaline-pumping action behind the tables.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s chief executive officer Stephan van den Oetelaar is confident that Kansino will provide Dutch players with unparalleled entertainment with Stakelogic Live’s entire suite of live dealer games together with branded Dutch-speaking tables.</p>
<p>Stakelogic also deepened its presence on the Italian market last December by launching gaming products with Betsson’s StarCasinò.</p>
