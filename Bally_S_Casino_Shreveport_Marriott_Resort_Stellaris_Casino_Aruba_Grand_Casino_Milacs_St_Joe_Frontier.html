<p>Spinomenal announced that it will also supply content to Palms Bet in Peru and Kenya</p>
<p>Spinomenal, a provider of cutting-edge online casino content, has minted a new Bulgaria-facing agreement with a major local operator. Under the new deal, the provider will power Palms Bet, a leading local iGaming and sports betting operator, with games.</p>
<p>As agreed, Spinomenal will leverage the CT Interactive platform to inject its full portfolio of games into the operator’s platform. As a result, Bulgarian customers will get to play some of the studio’s most popular casino titles.</p>
<p>Notable games that will be added to Palms Bet’s platform through this integration include titles such as Demi Gods II, Poseidon Rising, Book of Rampage and Majestic King, among others. In addition, players in Palms Bet’s casino lobby will be able to „take a trip into the Spinomenal Universe” which is described as an “interconnected world where leading characters from different series share adventures.”</p>
<p>In addition to the Bulgaria-facing deal with Palms Bet, Spinomenal prepares to deepen its ties with the company and also launch content with its Peruvian and Kenyan brands. Said integrations are expected to go live in the coming months, the company teased.</p>
<p>The past few months have also been busy for Spinomenal, which expanded in Portugal with Luckia and in Bulgaria with Alphawin.</p>
<p>Spinomenal’s Content Is a “Welcome Addition” to Palms Bet</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the latest deal with Spinomenal’s chief executive officer, Lior Shvartz, saying that his team is happy to launch games with Palms Bet. He lauded the operator as a leader in the Bulgarian market and the go-to platform for players in the country.</p>
<p>Palms Bet are pioneers in the Bulgarian market and have gone from strength-to-strength as a business. Players always come first for Palms Bet and we’re thrilled to bring our games to its casino. Lior Shvartz, CEO, Spinomenal</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhan Hadzhinikolov, chief of casino operations at Palms Bet, said that the deal will support his company’s commitment to give players “the very best casino experience.” He added that Spinomenal’s content is a great addition to the Palms Bet content lineup.</p>
<p>Giving our players the very best casino experience is what drives us forward as a business. Spinomenal’s library of games is a welcome addition, in particular its Spinomenal Universe, and will continue to build on our success. Zhan Hadzhinikolov, chief of casino operations, Palms Bet</p>
