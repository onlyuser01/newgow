    <h1>Fremont Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Juwa Online Casino Real Money Hotels Near Southland Casino Online</h1>

<p>UK-based sports betting giant William Hill announced today its US subsidiary opened up a retail sports book in Illinois, the operator’s first in the state. In partnership with Caesars Entertainment and its Grand Victoria Casino Elgin, the new sports book marked another milestone for William Hill’s strategy for expansion into regulated markets.</p>
<p>William Hill Enters Illinois</p>
<p>The William Hill-branded sports book at the Grand Victoria Casino Elgin opening also expands on the long-term partnership between the sports betting company and the casino operator. Both parties recently opened 6 betting kiosks in Isle Casino Hotel and Lady Luck Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado.</p>
<p>“Grand Victoria Casino is located just outside of Chicago – where some of the most passionate sports fans in the country live. I’m looking forward to seeing the community come together to watch their favorite teams as we welcome back the return of our favorite professional sports.” David Grolman, President, Retail Operations, William Hill</p>
<p>The retail sports book features three full-service ticket windows, out of which only two will be open to comply with physical distance requirements. Besides the service windows, the venue has multiple televisions for prime sports viewing, while seated in the comfort provided by the seating options near the high-top tables. As the health and safety of employees and guests is a top priority for the operator, the newly-opened sports book will follow a thorough protocol for cleaning.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the table games and slot machines in the casino, the William Hill sports book is expected to turn into a multi-stop for local sports fans willing to place a bet, while having a drink from the bar on the casino floor, located just steps away from the sports book.</p>
<p>“Partnering with the country’s leading sports betting operator allows us to offer our customers an elevated experience that features industry-leading wagering and technology. The sports book is in a prime location that will draw sports fans in and keep them engaged as they cheer on their favorite teams.” Bill Gustafson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Grand Victoria Casino</p>
<p>The opening of the retail sports book is just the first step regarding the sports betting market in Illinois, as William Hill intends on offering mobile sports betting to fans across the state, as soon as it receives the necessary regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Last month the online gambling operator outlined in a trading update that operations in the US significantly profited from the availability of alternative sports, as well as the resumption of the NASCAR Series and UFC in May, despite the suspension of all major leagues.</p>
