    <h1>Dakota Magic Casino In North Dakota Casino For Real Money Milky Way Casino Game Download For Android</h1>

<p>Dear Lacey,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the casinos takes KYC lightly.</p>
<p>I have created an account and checked how to complete the KYC verification, and this is what I found https://www.jackspay.com/tips-and-info/about-withdrawing/:</p>
<p>"Main Verification Documents</p>
<p>Photographic ID: A copy of a current photographic ID is required for your first withdrawal request. This photographic ID can be in the form of a copy of a Passport, Drivers License or National ID card. Specifically it is the photograph page of the ID that we require for our verification checks. Please ensure that your name, photograph and signature are visible on the document.</p>
<p>Credit/Debit Cards: A copy of the front and back of the credit/debit card(s) used to fund your account. Please ensure that all details are clearly legible to enable prompt and accurate verification. For security purposes block the middle eight numbers on the front of the card copy and the 3 digit security code at the back of the card copy.</p>
<p>Proof of address: This may be submitted in the form of a utility bill or a credit card statement. It should be a recent document showing your full name and address as registered on your account with us. If you provide a credit card statement please ensure that you blank out the eight middle numbers of the credit card.</p>
<p>Note: In some cases, depending on the payment method used to fund your account, you may be asked for one or a combination of the aforementioned documents, or additional documents not included in the list above."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t succeeded in contacting the live chat and still waiting for an email where to send those documents. Could you please advise if you have received any communication from the casino at all?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
