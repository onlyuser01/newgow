<p>The biggest star of the two-week poker binge is the NHLE Main Event scheduled for 24 November with a $22 buy-in and $1 million secured. Even though the highlight features the priciest entrance level across the series, it offers the best cash return rate. And if this is not enough, players have the chance to get into the game for a fraction of the standard stake. This is possible through the already ongoing Phase 1 events and the exclusive Spin $ Go‚Äôs costing only between $0.35 and $0.40 that will grant thousands of tickets. Competitors can earn $10K in MicroMillions passes by joining the freeroll set up for November 18. Players can make their way to the freeroll by participating in a minimum of 10 MicroMillions tournaments prior to that and one Phase event from 10 to 17 November.</p>
<p>Gear Up for the Second Week!</p>
<p>The second week of the MicroMillions will provide additional opportunity for freerolls. Each player who goes away without a prize on a MicroMillions event between 17 and 23 November will be allowed to an All-in Shootout the next day at 10:00 ET each allotting $2000 in tickets to other games. Focus of attention is also the Sunday Storm running on 17 November with a $11 buy-in and $250,000 prize pool as well as the huge $4.40 buy-in Phase event which guarantees $500,000 in cash. Phase 1 events are available for unlimited play and reaching Phase 2 means a secure payout.</p>
<p>MicroMillions 16 leaderboard is also in the spotlight with $5000 available in premiums. Players have a bigger chance of winning as they will compete against opponents from their own region, including Europe and the UK, Latin America, Asia, CIS and the rest of the world. Each regional leaderboard is entitled $1000, while the top-50 players will receive cash prices.</p>
<p>According to some of the main rules of the event, players will not be allowed to transfer, exchange, or refund the first ticket they have won for the MictoMillions Main Event. However, they will be able to exchange immediately the next pass they win to the MicroMillions Main Event for Tournament Money. Tickets gained via Spin &amp; Go will also be available for exchange against Tournament Money and after the end of MicroMillions, players will be free to enter tournaments with the corresponding buy-in of any unused MicroMillions tickets.</p>
