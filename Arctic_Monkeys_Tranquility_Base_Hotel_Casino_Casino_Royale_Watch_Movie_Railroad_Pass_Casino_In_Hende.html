    <h1>Arctic Monkeys Tranquility Base Hotel Casino Casino Royale Watch Movie Railroad Pass Casino In Hende</h1>

<p>When I made my deposits and redeemed my bonuses, it was all done by the support personnel's directly because I didn't want to make any mistakes and have my winnings or deposit be at any risk. But I'll sent you a copy, it's weird when you look at it and even I don't understand unless I explain what I did then you will get an idea of what the support person did....</p>
<p>Also my 300$ is not canceled just waiting for the right person with the right authority to approve the over ride on my payout.</p>
<p>Long story short I got a promotion added on from support help... for my cash deposit of 70ish, can't remember The exact number on top of my head but have it in my records... and I didn't want to risk my cash deposit or make anything void it...so support helped explain and redeemed the promotion for me. (Lost all my deposit and bonus ) Then the same support guy game me a $300 free bonus after, which I did good, and after asking same support person.... I was confirmed, and promised the withdraw is good and there's nonething wrong with my 300$ payout. I finished my wager so i submitted a payout withdraw, (didn't reach my wager requirements, wasn't told until after I made a new deposit....)</p>
<p>After the requested payout is pendrivers went on with another cash deposit some time later in the day. Lost my cash deposit......and asked for a bonus cash and got a cash deposit promotion Instead... So if your still following, i was confused myself why i got a cash deposit promotion instead of a bonus cash... I did good again, but I wasn't able to withdraw $400-max cash out like the support guy said since my deposit was $40. Reason was, I played my cash deposit first then got the promotion after, As I was playing slots, I reached the wager bonus and I was told its only bonus cash instead of cash deposit promotion. Now while waiting for the 300 payout I was told I didnt reach the wager on it.... Lastly, the supervisor and I came into a resolution that I cancel the 300, and withdraw 160 first, then after finishing the wager on the 300$ I can withdraw that.... What I wasn't told was, their server thinks I'm making two withdraws without a deposit.... So my payouts are backwards, and my cash deposit wasn't acknowledged in the order I made them and The computer thinks I'm trying to withdraw two bonus cash....Oh and I had to wait even longer to be approved because I don't have a driver's license or passport, I have a STATE ID issued card, and of course! (they only accept drivers licenses and passport) I Hope I wrote it good enough for you, to get an idea of what I went through as simplified and specific to understand and follow</p>
