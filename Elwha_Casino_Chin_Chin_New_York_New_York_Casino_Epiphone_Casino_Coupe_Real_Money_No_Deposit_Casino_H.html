<p>In any business, getting started requires patience and tenacity. Even for seasoned operations, a ramp-up period of 12-24 months is expected. Restaurant Marigold at Resorts World Las Vegas (RWLV) didn’t make it to the minimum. It has shut down after only five months.</p>
<p>Restaurant Marigold Exits RWLV</p>
<p>According to RWLV spokeswoman Dana Rutkin the restaurant, which was run by Chef Billy Richardson, has been closed since December 2. However, Rutkin announced that Resorts World would soon unveil a new restaurant that will be open in the spring.</p>
<p>RWLV was opened on June 24 and features more than 40 bars and restaurants, including Marigold. Marigold is a new American concept, with burgers and heavy lobster emphasis.</p>
<p>Marigold’s website didn’t mention the closure of the restaurant and no additional information has been given. The eatery had decent reviews from patrons, with one reviewer on Google calling it the “highlight” of their Vegas trip. A few people complained about the prices, but, at a resort that offers $15,000-a-night suites and charges for valet parking, anyone visiting can expect to pay more.</p>
<p>Not Chef Richardson’s First Rodeo</p>
<p>Richardson also has restaurants at The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Holsteins Shakes &amp; Buns; Haute Doggery &amp; Flour &amp; Barley both at The Linq Promenade; as well as Elephant Bar Restaurant in Albuquerque, NM. He’s obviously a veteran with plenty of experience in the business.</p>
<p>Richardson’s father, Bill Richardson, was the RWLV construction manager through his W.A. Richardson Builders, LLC. company.</p>
<p>Marigold may be departing, but a new eatery joining the resort will offer an even more tempting opportunity. Coming at the end of December is Carversteak, a dining experience that promises to be completely on a level of its own.</p>
<p>The restaurant is the brainchild of former casino executive and entrepreneur Sean Christie, who has already been involved in numerous launches in the casino resort scene. This new venue, however, is going to be completely unique. In addition to bringing in chef Daniel Ontiveros to cook up bone-in filets, Flannery Beef rib eyes, and American wagyu tomahawks, there’s the $40,000 cocktail package.</p>
<p>This includes a version of Francesco Lafranconi’s the B Signal cocktail made with rare Clase Azul Ultra tequila. According to the Robb Report, anyone who orders this gets the drink, as well as “the entire bottle of tequila, a decanter, a cocktail class with Lafranconi and a Rolex GMT–Master II ‘Batman’ two-tone watch that simultaneously displays the time in two time zones.”</p>
