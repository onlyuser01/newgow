<p>Hotel Yeti-way review</p>
<p>Hotel Yeti-way is themed around a charming Yeti on a tropical holiday.</p>
<p>Players will dip their toes in warm ocean water as they join a mythical mountain ape for some fun in the sun. As they surf, swim, and bungee jump together, they’ll get into the swing of vacation life.</p>
<p>The lighthearted atmosphere of this slot makes it an ideal choice for those looking for an upbeat experience.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation style feels modern, with bright colors and a welcoming aesthetic. The reels are packed with vacation accessories, including sunscreen, sandals, and sunglasses.</p>
<p>The reels are framed by a surf hut with plenty of palm leaves swaying nearby. It’s fun to imagine sauntering up to the hut to rent a surfboard only to find a Yeti running the show.</p>
<p>The Yeti character is a charming fellow who is up for adventure. He seems to be spending his time in the tropics engaging in many daring holiday activities and not missing his mountain home one bit.</p>
<p>A friendly seabird stands on the reels pecking for food, ruffling his feathers, and being generally quite adorable.</p>
<p>Lazy ukulele strumming ensures that the soundtrack has a Hawaiian feel. Gentle bird calls give life to the seabird character and help establish the beachside setting.</p>
<p>Together, the graphics and soundtrack establish a cheerful holiday vibe.</p>

<p>Hotel Yeti-way is a six-reel, four-row slot.</p>

<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for every symbol with the exclusion of the Scatter symbol.</p>
