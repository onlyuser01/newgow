    <h1>Casino San Bernardino Casino Royale The Movie Casino Mesquite Nv D Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Birmi</h1>

<p>One of the leading college sports conference has selected US integrity to ensure the integrity of college sports games in the age of rapidly expanding sports gambling</p>
<p>The partnership sees US Integrity, a specialist that focuses on integrity and monitoring, deliver its range of tools and solutions, along with its monitoring software, to Big 12.</p>
<p>Big 12 Wants Its Games to Have Integrity</p>
<p>The companies will focus on monitoring betting activities surrounding college games, and it comes at a time when the NCAA is rocked by a large scandal involving student-athletes and coaches who may have been betting on their own games.</p>
<p>Sports wagering is prohibited by participants in competitions, and Big 12 wants to ensure that it has the means to monitor and police its players and staff. Commenting on this new tie-up, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark had this to say:</p>
<p>The Big 12 Conference is thrilled to partner with U.S. Integrity as a continuation of its commitment to sports betting compliance. Given the current landscape of sports betting in our industry, it’s more important than ever to double down on ensuring sport integrity across our Conference. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark</p>
<p>Big 12 will gain access to the ProhiBet technology which is designed as a secure and transparent method for sportsbook operators and sports properties to track betting activity and flag instances where it’s suspected that student-athletes, coaches, or administrative staff may have had something to do with the outcome of an NCAA athletic contest.</p>
<p>Matt Heap, ProhiBet managing director, spoke about the significance of the partnership and what it meant for Big 12. Thanks to PhohiBet’s advanced system and Big 12’s dedication to ensuring that its contests have integrity, this partnership will allow the conference to ensure the transparency and trustworthiness of collegiate sports betting activities.</p>
<p>NCAA Looking to Ensure Integrity of College Sports</p>
<p>Big 12 is also looking to presently strengthen the way it disseminates its data and is working closer with partners to ensure that suspicious betting patterns are tracked in a timely manner. In the meantime, the NCAA has been stepping up its efforts into potential breaches of the association’s betting rules.</p>
<p>In July, the NCAA confirmed that there were 175 infractions on record with 17 ongoing investigations tying them up.</p>
