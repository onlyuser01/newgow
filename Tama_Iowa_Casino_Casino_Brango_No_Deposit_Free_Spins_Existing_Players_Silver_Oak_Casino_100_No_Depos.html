<p>Gambling software developer featuring one-stop-shop iGaming software solutions for sportsbooks and online casinos SOFTSWISS has announced a new content distribution deal with iGaming studio Popiplay. The Sweden-based studio was established in 2022 under a license issued in Curacao. The studio is busy creating state-of-the-art online slots that are highly rewarding and entertaining for players with the help of its expert team managed by Nikola Teofilovic, a reputable name in professional online gambling.</p>
<p>The Collaboration to Bring “Outstanding Results for Both Teams”</p>
<p>Softswiss Game Aggregator’s head Tatyana Kaminskaya spoke about the fresh partnership as one expected to attract “outstanding results” for both parties. In spite of the fresh introduction of Popiplay’s products focused on streaming and high rollers on the iGaming market, the team has already proven its interest in revamping games “with great enthusiasm.” Kaminskaya added that Softswiss Game Aggregator’s clients are prone to enjoy the offers of their brand-new partner.</p>
<p>Popiplay’s games are known for cascading reels, chance 2x, chance 3x, bonus buy, and free spins features, all showcasing the brand’s “amazing potential,” as described by co-founder and chair of the board Nikola Teofilovic. Popiplay games also support multi-language content, provide variable Return to Player rates and they are compatible with all fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Teofilovic also believes the new partnership will enable them to start exploring fresh business opportunities while working on creating “strong and trustworthy connections” with both partners and players. Speaking about SOFTSWISS, he described its presence as a powerful one in the iGaming market. Mixed with Popiplay’s “innovative and engaging” gaming offering, Teofilovic believes it has the potential to create a successful business relationship in the long run for both companies.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS’ Game Aggregator Hosts 13,000+ Casino Titles</p>
<p>At the moment, the Game Aggregator by SOFTSWISS is home to more than 13,000 games that can be easily incorporated into gaming platforms with the help of a single application programming interface. According to the terms of the new deal, Popiplay will be adding its own games to the existing offering. SOFTWISS also partnered with Gaming Corps, another Sweden-based studio founded in 2014 and listed as a public company one year later. The company has a strong focus on modern-day games with cool features and its offering includes titles like Stormy Witch, Skyliner, and Coin Miner. Gaming Corp’s chief commercial officer Mats Lundin called SOFTSWISS an “iGaming giant” with “pedigree and foresight,” further explaining the new partnership. SOFTWSWISS’ Game Aggregator also hosts more than 180 iGaming studios and it is entirely dedicated to innovation, top-quality offers, and highly sustainable solutions.</p>
