    <h1>Casino In Poconos Casinos In Tahoe Choctaw Casino Resort Grant The M Casino Cal Neva Lodge Casino Pa</h1>

<p>I joined this casino on 10/12-22 after being recommended this on a casino site. I have played a lot and made about 10 deposits until I finally won so much that I wanted to withdraw what I won. When I choose to make a withdrawal, I am immediately asked to verify my account. I upload all documents and then contact chat support to see how long it will take. I am told that it will take 2 days and that I will then receive an email when my account has been verified.</p>
<p>2 days later I contact the chat support again as I have not received any email and then instead I get the message that the verification will not be processed if you do not simultaneously make a withdrawal at the same time. I wasn't allowed to make a withdrawal request because I wasn't verified but am now getting information that a verification won't be processed unless you make a withdrawal request at the same time?! I then do as I am told and make a withdrawal request and am informed that this will take 2 days.</p>
<p>Now today, 14/12-22, I am informed that my withdrawal request is denied because I have not transferred my money enough times. I then contact the chat support to find out what they mean because I did not choose any bonus or similar when I deposited money into my casino account. Then I am informed that it is stated in the casino's "terms &amp; conditions" that I must convert my deposit 10 times before I can make a withdrawal. I am of course shocked by the news and cannot understand why you have to convert a deposit that you have not chosen into a bonus or similar in connection with the deposit and receive the message that it is stated in their terms &amp; conditions. At the same time, I am asked if I want the support agent to check how much turnover is left before I can make a withdrawal of my winnings, and I answer yes to this. Then the next shock comes when I get the message that I have SEK 67,962 left to convert! I reply that there must be something wrong as I only made a deposit of 100 Euros on my last deposit and then get the answer that the casino adds up ALL my deposits in the turnover requirement. I answer of course that this whole situation is absurd and that it cannot be allowed to happen in this way.</p>
<p>Although there is a requirement to convert my deposit 10 times, you cannot count all my deposits since I first created my account with the casino. In addition, there is no support in their terms &amp; conditions for what the casino claims applies as it only says "NewEra BV reserves the right to reject the withdrawal or apply an administrative fee of up to 8%, in case the deposit amount is not rolled over at least 10 times". It says nothing that it applies to all deposits or any total sum that counts from previous deposits, but that it only applies to the deposit to which my withdrawal is linked.</p>
<p>The casino has created these "terms &amp; conditions" only to cheat players out of money and nothing else. It's fraud and I want what I'm entitled to and that's my profit!</p>
