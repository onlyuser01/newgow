    <h1>Casino In Dania Beach Pokerstars Casino Casino Imdb Biloxi Casino New Casino Games Free LuckyBull Ca</h1>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a few questions and maybe you can help me solve this .</p>
<p>In August i won an amount of €3000 at LuckyBull. They paid me out every 2 weeks a €1000 . So this amount i recived in 6 weeks, the 25th of August, the 9th of september and the last payment was on the 23th of september. what i didnt like because it Stated different in there policy ( monthly cashout €5000)</p>
<p>But in that time i kept playing so on the 5th of september i won another €3000. So i ask for a withdrawal request, in chat they said i have wait because i have the other payouts .</p>
<p>Oke so i cancel the withdrawal and start playing , it turn out to be €4000 , so i made another request a week later ( not to sure about the week) i have all the proof . And coatumerservice told me i can try , so i did and i could withdrawal. When you make a withdrawal you get up to 48 hours for it to be reviewed . And days were passing by and my withdrawal was still pending , no approve nothing . So i cancelled it and played and lost a €1000. So back a forth it was loosing , winning untill it became €2000 and than €1000and now i was becoming mad at LuckyBull because they were not approving my withdrawal. So i went on chat and start asking when will i get my approval and the answers where not satisfying for me , no concrete answers. Like it will be reviewed. So last night i went to play it all so i can finish with them(LuckyBull)but than again won an amount of 2400</p>
<p>So now i decided to take my winnings , because winning loosing and winning again means you have to take it.</p>
<p>So my question can you help me with communication with LuckyBull to approve my withdrawal .</p>
<p>And secondly there own policy says montly €5000 but they do €1000 every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>And i asked a question today in chag about closing of casino's in the netherlands and costumer service doesnt know nothing about that .</p>
<p>LuckyBull i hope you withdrawal the amount to my bank .it was an honest winning , so i hope i will see it soon .</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
