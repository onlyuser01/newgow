<p>Checkd Group, a leading iGaming business, has appointed Alan Davey as its new head of sports for the company’s media division. Davey previously worked as a product manager and will now be in charge of Checkd Media’s sports strategy which will be focusing more actively on expanding its reach in the North American market and region.</p>
<p>Checkd Group’s New Head of Sports Is an Experienced Veteran</p>
<p>The company will pivot much of its strategy on the FlashPicks brand which is designed to increase its gamification potential. Davey is perfectly qualified for the job, the company assures, as he has a background in product development and will be an indelible part of the company’s future success.</p>
<p>He will help with the rollout of technology-based solutions and sports content that will be shared with partners in both the North American and UK markets. Meanwhile, FlashPicks already holds a license in 15 jurisdictions in the United States and Ontario, the newly regulated iGaming market in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>FlashPicks is also improving its overall product with a US sports ribbon featuring NFL, NCAAF, NCAAB, and NBA fixtures and odds that are delivered directly by Checkd’s partners in the United States. Checkd has an established track record of delivering excellent and result-driven solutions that are part of its overall product proposition and portfolio, including the Acca Assist product which has become a hit with Sky Bet customers.</p>
<p>Checkd Media managing director Alex Beecham said that the company was very happy to be bringing a new head of sports, as the role will be pivotal for the company’s further success in the United States and across the Atlantic. Beecham added:</p>
<p>It was important that we appointed someone with authority and a deep understanding of our business and the wider industry. Alan’s experience and insight will undoubtedly help us achieve our goals. Checkd Media managing director Alex Beecham</p>
<p>The New Head of Sports Is Confident in Future Success</p>
<p>As Checkd Media head of sports, Davey welcomed the appointment and said that it was his privilege to be appointed in this responsible position and said that he was looking forward to contributing to Checkd Group’s success.</p>
<p>He assured that the company is going to continue to make progress and deliver on the promises that it has made to its sports betting communities and partners. “It’s an exciting time to be at Checkd Group and I look forward to hitting new milestones as we continue to grow,” Davey concluded.</p>
<p>In August, Checkd Group appointed Will Tyrrell as director of marketing for the United Kingdom.</p>
