<p>The Las Vegas Raiders vs. Kansas City Chiefs is a 2023 Christmas Day game. The Week 16 AFC West duel is on the program on Monday afternoon at Arrowhead Stadium, with a live broadcast on CBS</p>
<p>The reigning NFL champions, the Kansas City Chiefs are 9-5 on the season, with four losses in the last seven games. Their recent run isn’t great, but they have the manpower to beat the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>At least that’s what the Raiders vs. Chiefs odds suggest – the home team is seen as a 10-point favorite against its divisional rival, which is 6-8 right now.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Raiders Praying for a Christmas Miracle</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders are 1-9 against the Kansas City Chiefs in their last 10 duels in the NFL. The only time they won within the last five years was in 2020 when they beat the Chiefs by eight points at empty Arrowhead (due to COVID protocols).</p>
<p>In the 2023 NFL season, they’ve played against their AFC West rivals once already, losing 31-17 in Vegas. Now, they’re supposed to play against the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. This is very bad news for the Raiders as they’re not very good on the road this season. In fact, with a 1-5 away record, they’re the worst away side in the AFC.</p>
<p>Viva Las Vegas!</p>
<p>The Raiders beat the Chargers 63-21.</p>

<p>All this explains why oddsmakers think they’re very likely to lose on Christmas. However, there’s one thing that’s giving them hope for this game. The thing is that in their most recent game, the Raiders demolished the Los Angeles Chargers 63-21.</p>
<p>It was a superb effort by the Raiders’ offense, but the game would’ve been different for their defense if the Chargers’ starting QB Justin Herbert wasn’t out with an injury.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs Upping Their Form at the Right Time</p>
<p>From Week 8 to Week 14, the Kansas City Chiefs lost four games. However, in Week 15, they made their return to the winning track with a 27-17 victory over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. Even though the Pats are horrible in 2023, the Chiefs did look very well in that game.</p>
<p>Now, they’re coming back home for Christmas and are expected to put on a show to remember for their fans. A win on Monday would get them one step closer to winning the AFC West. Further, a win would give them a chance to challenge for the No. 1 seed in the AFC.</p>
<p>They’re now third in the conference, but there’s a possibility that they could move all the way to the top by the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Raiders vs. Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a great game for fans as we’re likely to see offensive brilliance from both teams. The Raiders will probably score a couple of TDs on Christmas, but we’re sure the Chiefs will score more. But will they score enough to cover the huge 10-point spread?</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, we’d say no. However, this is a Christmas game played at Arrowhead and the Chiefs will want to put on a memorable show for everyone in attendance. Apart from making their fans happy, they also want a big win to bring their level of confidence back up after a couple of disappointing weeks.</p>
<p>Pick: Kansas City Chiefs -10</p>
