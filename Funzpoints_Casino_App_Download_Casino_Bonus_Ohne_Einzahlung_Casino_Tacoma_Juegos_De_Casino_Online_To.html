<p>Gila River Resorts &amp; Casinos (GRRC) has chosen NBA star Jae Crowder to sign its first professional athlete deal in history. The endorsement partnership will start with Phoenix Suns’ 31-year-old starter hosting the Summer Oasis Pool Party.</p>
<p>Why GRRC Chose “Bossman” Crowder As First Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Using the voice of this president and chief marketing officer Dominic Orozco, GRRC welcomed Jae Crowder to the team, describing him as a “bossman” the company feels “honored” to choose as its first-ever brand ambassador.</p>
<p>The enterprise is looking forward to celebrating the designation of its new resorts in an unforgettable manner with Crowder’s talent and vision by its side. GRRC is the biggest gaming venue serving the Phoenix metro area. It owns three locations in Arizona (Wild Horse Pass, Lone Butte, and Vee Quiva) as well as the Santan Mountain casino that will open in December.</p>
<p>Crowder officially became a Phoenix Suns player in 2020, helping the team make it into the NBA playoffs in the past two seasons. He is also known for his unique clothing brand called Bossman which expresses his unapologetic personality and desire to be himself. His vision goes hand in hand with GRRC’s “You Do You.” mantra. Crowder is also popular for his intentions to constantly give back to the local community, as well as for his entrepreneurship skills.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new brand ambassador deal, the player mentioned the shared vision with Gila River and the many things they have in common. He also stated that, as a top-tier athlete playing at one of the NBA’s biggest teams, Crowder is looking to expand his local ties with people he trusts.</p>
<p>Bossman Will Host Five Summer Oasis Pool Parties</p>
<p>One of the first brand ambassador tasks that Crowder will need to handle for the enterprise currently under Gila River Indian Community’s ownership is to host the Summer Oasis Pool Party from May through September. The party event will be held at GRRC’s Wild Horse Pass location in Chandler and it will reunite famous DJs on the last Saturday of every month.</p>
<p>In January, Gila River announced it would change its name to reflect an elevated casino experience. After 27 years of existence as Gila River Hotel &amp; Casinos, the enterprise turned into Gila River Resorts &amp; Casinos. Two of the resorts owned by GRRC at Wild Horse Pass and Vee Quiva have received the prestigious Four Diamond accreditation. All locations are open nonstop, all year long, and they provide a mix of live casino, slots machines, poker games, and BetMGM sportsbooks.</p>
