    <h1>Best Casino Bonus Ojos Locos Casino Casino Royale Vegas Best Live Casino Brighton Casino Relax Gamin</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming has announced the signing of a deal with British operator William Hill that will allow the content supplier to offer its games through William Hill’s website. The agreement also includes content by other companies that have used Relax’s native Powered by Relax and Silver Bullet solutions.</p>
<p>The move is part of Relax’s strategy of global expansion, which will see William Hill feature Relax’s games, including Money Train 2, a slot with a 50,000x maximum win available thanks to the built-in Money Cart Bonus Round feature. Top Dawg$ is another name on the list, which is “overflowing with features,” including mystery respins and free spins.</p>
<p>Craig Staples, head of gaming content at William Hill, praised the deal and its new partner, stating, “We are delighted to partner with the leading supplier of game-changing content, and offer Relax’s award-winning games, as well as slots from its highly innovative partnership studios.”</p>
<p>Andrew Crosby, director of account management at Relax Gaming, has also expressed his satisfaction with the deal and shared his hopes for the future. He added that Relax was highly confident that the companies will be able to continue working together for many years to come.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Builds up Assets Worldwide</p>
<p>The current deal with William Hill is just another step forward for Relax Gaming after the company signed an agreement to supply PokerStars with content at the end of August. As a result, PokerStars can pick content produced by up to 50 developers, all thanks to Relax Gaming’s native Powered by Relax and Silver Bullet Partnership initiatives.</p>
<p>In May, the content producer received a supplier license from the UK Gambling Commission through its Gibraltar subsidiary. The move enabled Relax Gaming to seek and establish its presence in one of the world’s biggest iGaming markets.</p>
<p>In March, Relax Gaming signed a similar deal with Parimatch. Back then, top officials at the company commented that the agreement would allow Parimatch to enjoy more digital content, while Relax Gaming would benefit from adding yet another respectable name from the industry to its list of customers.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming at a Glance</p>
<p>Relax Gaming features more than 2000 online casino games in its portfolio and is proud of its line of trophies. In 2021, the content producer won the “Casino Content Supplier” 2021 EGR Award in February and “Casino Software Supplier” at the EGR B2B 2020 Awards. Relax Gaming is an established name in the gaming industry, mainly due to its unique and customer-focused approach.</p>
