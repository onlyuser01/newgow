<p>Information about NextGen casinos</p>
<p>NextGen has a solid reputation for producing quality casino slots since 1999. Now part of the Scientific Gaming group under the NYX Gaming brand, it continues to specialize in providing titles for online and land-based casinos.</p>
<p>You can find many casinos with games from the NextGen catalog on Casino Guru, and this page will help you find the best ones. There's also information about NextGen's history, how their games work and what you can do to find bonuses from NextGen casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>NextGen – over two decades of quality gaming content, now under the SGI name</p>
<p>NextGen (or Next Generation) Gaming began trading as a division of Next Generation Entertainment back in 1999. Its remit was to cater to the rising demand for online casino games in Australia, as well as to supply titles to popular land-based establishments.</p>
<p>The company slowly but surely gained a foothold in the domestic market over the following decade or so. By 2011, NextGen had an expansive selection of gaming titles, and a customer base to match, so it wasn't a surprise when another big-hitting provider offered them the chance to join forces.</p>
<p>Note: NextGen and Sweden-based NYX Gaming announced their merger in November 2011, creating a portfolio of over 300 games, and a global pool of clients. The partnership went on to new heights over the next few years and there was another major deal on the cards in late 2017, when Scientific Games (SG) appeared on the horizon.</p>
<p>The new alliance, worth $630 million, meant that NYX and NextGen were absorbed into SG's interactive division, known as SG Digital, or SGI. You'll find NextGen's output under the SGI banner today, as part of a giant gaming company that wants to be the leader in its field. New games still appear under the SGI/NextGen name, with the latter providing the mechanics behind each new title. Each game is subject to strict gaming regulations, including the respected Malta Gaming Authority license, so players should feel safe when playing on them.</p>
<p>Nextgen games and software</p>
<p>Nextgen's success has come down to its focus on catchy gameplay and impressive graphics which has earned it many admirers in the iGaming industry. NextGen titles come with SGI's state-of-the-art Open Gaming System (OGS) software, which allows partners to access thousands of games from many game providers.</p>
<p>Merlin's Millions is one such example of impressively animated aesthetics. Featuring Merlin himself standing at one side of the reels casting spells, the game spins along nicely, with its magic-related symbols and promises of features such as its Superbet – a kind of multiplier which can increase your win, but also increases your stake. Look out for the magic orbs too, three of which will give you free spins.</p>
<p>Nextgen also show off a range of animal-themed slots, ranging from Butterflies to Gorilla Go Wild. The latter has echoes of Donkey Kong, with its main character grabbing bananas every time you get a good spin. The temple symbols are the ones to keep an eye on though, as these will trigger the Gary the Gorilla Kingdom Feature, where you get to choose the bonus game you want.</p>
<p>If you're looking for games with a historical twist, then NextGen also have slots inspired by past events. 300 Shields is one of those, set in the times of the Ancient Greeks. Get three or more shields on the war-like reels to activate free spins – the more shields you have the more spins you get. There are also huge multipliers available, which help to make this title a popular choice.</p>
<p>Note: It can be a little tricky to adjust the bet amount and activate the auto spin. To do this, look for the settings symbol which should be next to the reels: once there, you can use the sliders to find your required levels.</p>
<p>Apart from slots titles, you'll also see several classic casino table games in NextGen's catalog. Blackjack and roulette titles are there, each with the customary NextGen slick gameplay. You can try these, and the above slots, for free on our list of free NextGen games – this is much recommended if you'd like to see how the games work before parting with your hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>How to find the best NextGen online casino</p>
<p>While you can be assured that the standard of NextGen, or SGI, games is very high, it's also important to find a top-quality casino to play them on. Trawling through scores of sites can be a taxing process, so the team at Casino Guru has designed this page to guide you to the very best NextGen casinos out there.</p>
<p>Whenever a new casino appears on our database, our team subjects it to a rigorous testing process where they assess the quality of its customer service and the range of games it has available. The casinos that do the best are awarded with a place in our recommended list, which you can see by selecting the 'Recommended' tab. The latest NextGen casinos can also be seen by hitting the 'Newly opened' tab. The 'All' tab, meanwhile, will give you the full list of NextGen sites.</p>
<p>Note: For a more in-depth look into what we do to assess each casino, take a look at our How we review online casinos article to see exactly how we arrive at our ratings.</p>
<p>How to find NextGen online casino bonuses</p>
<p>Many online casino players look forward to finding a casino bonus after they sign up to a new site, and you can find deposit bonuses, those awarded once you put money down, and no deposit bonuses, that require no deposit at all, on Casino Guru.</p>
<p>First of all, you can go our list of casino bonuses and choose 'NextGen' in the gaming provider filter to see all the bonuses offered by NextGen casinos. To filter these by type, go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and choose the one you'd like, such as the no deposit bonuses, for example. Another way of seeing a full list of NextGen no deposit casinos is by going to our list of no deposit bonuses and selecting 'NextGen' there.</p>
<p>You can be rest assured that any bonus you see will be valid and ready to go due to the Casino Guru team's hard work in keeping them up to date.</p>
