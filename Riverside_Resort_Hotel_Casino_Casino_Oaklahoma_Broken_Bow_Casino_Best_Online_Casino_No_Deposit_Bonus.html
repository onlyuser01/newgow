    <h1>Riverside Resort Hotel Casino Casino Oaklahoma Broken Bow Casino Best Online Casino No Deposit Bonus</h1>

<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has established a new federal authority to regulate the country’s commercial gambling operations, which are still the subject of debate and speculation but a little closer to tangible reality owing to the Wynn Al Marjan casino resort project that is due to arrive in 2027 and transform the UAE into a hub for gambling and tourism.</p>
<p>The newly-formed General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA) has already sought to appoint executives, with the announcement shared by WAM, a state-run news agency, and cited by media outlets, confirming the creation of the watchdog and also revealing the names of the chief executive and chairman of the nascent authority.</p>
<p>In this case, the appointments concern Kevin Mullally, who will be stepping in as the Chief Executive Officer of the regulatory, and he has similar experience as Executive Director of the Missouri Gaming Commission which was in charge of the state’s riverboat casinos.</p>
<p>Mullally is a seasoned veteran who has extensive experience in the gambling industry and is prepared to help the UAE forge a robust framework that allows it to move through gambling regulation with ease. Commenting on his appointment and quoted by WAM, Mullally said:</p>
<p>"I am delighted to have been appointed as the inaugural CEO of the GCGRA. With my experienced colleagues, I look forward to establishing a robust regulatory body and framework for the UAE’s lottery and gaming industry."</p>
<p>Mullally is hardly the sole industry heavyweight to have been tapped by the GCGRA. He is joined by former MGM Resorts International Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Murren, who is another prominent name in the gambling industry and a respected individual with vast experience under his belt.</p>
<p>Both these executives will now work to meet what the regulator’s publicly outlined goals are according to the media report shared by WAM. At the crux of GCGRA’s efforts is a determination to create a socially responsible and regulated gaming environment that will see any authorized entity and participant adhere to the highest industry standards as outlined by the regulator.</p>
<p>The GCGRA will ultimately seek to ensure that a healthy and vibrant gaming industry is established, bringing more economic opportunities to the region. The Middle East is generally not a welcoming place to casinos, although such properties do operate in Lebanon and Egypt.</p>
<p>The UAE is now planning to completely shift the balance of powers and introduce a much more comprehensive gambling framework and a Las Vegas-style casino resort that will transform the region and draw global tourists. It’s not yet clear how the authority will navigate the difficult legal makeup of the UAE which places the ultimate power of the seven sheikhdoms onto their respective rulers.</p>
