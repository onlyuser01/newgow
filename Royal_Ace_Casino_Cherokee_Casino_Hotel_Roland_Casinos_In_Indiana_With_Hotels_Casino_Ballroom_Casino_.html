<p>To help Connecticut fight off COVID-19, the Mohegan Tribe opened a community vaccination site. Since its opening in mid-February until last week, approximately1,200 have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,200 People Have Been Vaccinated at Mohegan’s Site</p>
<p>The Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut has been eager to help local authorities fight off the pandemic since its start in March last year. In collaboration with Governor Ned Lamont and Yale New Haven Health System, the Tribe opened a community vaccination site.</p>
<p>Located at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, the site has been operating since mid-February. The vaccination site is positioned at Mohegan’s Earth Expo and Convention Center. Consequently, since it opened, until last week Friday, approximately 1,200 people have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>“This latest mass vaccination site shows the coordinated effort our state is making with our tribal partners, and our partners in healthcare.” Governor Ned Lamont</p>
<p>Mohegan Sun is one of the biggest employers in the region. This undoubtedly helped spread the word, considering that many of the residents have family members working there. Furthermore, the property’s free parking also contributed positively.</p>
<p>In a statement, Governor Lamont acknowledged that the mass vaccination site shows the coordinated efforts between the tribal partners, the state, and healthcare. Furthermore, he stressed that Mohegan Sun has taken “incredible steps throughout the pandemic“. Last but not least, the Governor said that the pandemic will be defeated by working together, and “that’s exactly what this site represents.“</p>
<p>Mohegan Invests over $1 Million in Its Safety Program</p>
<p>Besides the vaccination site, Mohegan Sun opened a COVID-19 testing site in the autumn. The testing site was established once again in partnership with Yale New Haven Health. Located at one of the parking garages at Mohegan Sun, the site is still operating every day of the week. Furthermore, there is no age restriction for visitors who would like to get tested.</p>
<p>Last month, Mohegan Sun announced that it was among the first casino resorts in the world to become Sharecare Health Security VERIFIED with Forbes Travel Guide. The operator accomplished this thanks to introducing strict health procedures ensuring the safety of visitors.</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, Mohegan Sun proved to be eager to operate as safely as possible. The venue implemented state-of-the-art safety technology and rigorous cleaning protocols. Furthermore, it helped to distribute PPE to healthcare partners and as noted, helped the local communities with COVID testing and vaccination. Overall, Mohegan Sun has invested more than $1 million in its health and safety protocols.</p>
