<p>The first blockchain game that mirrors the real world of thoroughbred horse racing, Game of Silks, expanded its team of experts with the addition of the sports, entertainment and gaming veteran, Ron Luniewski. Joining the company's C-suite, he was appointed to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer.</p>
<p>Game of Silks, also popular as Silks, was launched back in June 2021 by Co-founders Troy Levy and Dan Nissanoff. The unique game brings an in-game economy as well as a marketplace, enabling users to trade and own horses, land, avatars, as well as stables. Consequently, users can earn different skill-related rewards and feel the thrill the ownership of thoroughbred horses brings.</p>
<p>Silks leverages a "blockchain-enabled metaverse and a derivative model to create digital twins of each year’s crop of registered thoroughbred yearlings," a statement reveals. Those NFTs mirror the training progress, bloodlines and racing performance of real thoroughbred horses. This allows the online players to secure prizes whenever real-life counterparts of the thoroughbred horses breed offspring or win different races.</p>
<p>Dan Nissanoff, Silks' CEO and co-founder, shared his excitement about the recent senior-level appointment. "With the first Game of Silks racing season in full swing, our business is looking to scale rapidly to new users and showcase what’s possible when you marry the timeless tradition of horse racing with blockchain technology," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nissanoff pointed out: "Ron’s experience growing successful companies from start-up status to IPO, adapting and implementing new technology, and his deep industry connections to the global horse racing community are invaluable in any market."</p>
<p>Luniewski was similarly delighted to join Game of Silks and explained that throughout his career, he enjoyed leveraging innovative technology to help propel the horse racing vertical. This, according to him, inspired him and made the decision to join Silks even easier. "Silks is a revolutionary platform that can fundamentally change horse racing by giving a whole new class of fans the ability to participate in this sport," added Luniewski.</p>
<p>Finally, Silks' new President and Chief Operating Officer pointed out: "Major players in racing, like the New York Racing Association (NYRA), have already hitched their wagon to Game of Silks, having seen its potential. We’re excited to establish additional partnerships with the racing community as we advance." With Luniewski aboard, Silks anticipates further growth and expansion of its operations as it meets the increasing demand for its services.</p>
<p>Before joining Silks, Luniewski held a strategic role with Xpressbet. Although the company started as a small operation with 15 employees, under his guidance, Xpressbet grew to a company with more than 150 employees and that surpasses $300m in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Additionally, Luniewski's professional experience includes other senior-level roles that enabled him to accumulate significant knowledge and experience within different gaming, sports and entertainment companies.</p>
