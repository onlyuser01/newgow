    <h1>Slots Capital Casino Revel Casino Bally S Casino Las Vegas Casinos In Deadwood 100 Free Bonus Casino</h1>

<p>My first request to withdraw was denied based on a coupon. I deposited several more times, and won 2500. The withdrawal request was for September 6th. After waiting the 5 business days for them to approve or deny, I contacted casino to ask why my withdrawal still shows pending. The rep did the usual dance of sending me casino policy that I can repeat by heart. Then the rep proceeded in saying oh, you account needs verification of address. I have not received any communication from casino about my old address. I have received from my previous attempt, emails stating my account was verified. Then before sending anything to me on the same day, the casino deposits my withdrawal back into my account. I flipped, bc I sent my new drivers license and utility bill in proving my address. They canceled to start the clock over. Then some concierge emails me some crap about wanting my documents again. He actually forwarded my email string that included the very documents he was requesting. I completely lost it after that. No response, then an email from documents team that my account was verified and good to go on Monday. I proved my withdrawal was canceled by casino in error with the emails, so my withdrawal which now still has the 15th instead of 6th on it shows pending. Now nobody will return any emails. I know they are stalling, and the error was on their part. I’m completely verified with all their sister casinos which are data connected. Oh, and once I proved they had my documents, it was , well you never gave us your Bitcoin address. Are you kidding?!?! You have to submit your Bitcoin address to submit a withdrawal, and I sent verification of my Bitcoin address in the emails that are in all the forwarded email chains. My emails can be sent for review, but I need a way to upload since it’s so large.</p>
