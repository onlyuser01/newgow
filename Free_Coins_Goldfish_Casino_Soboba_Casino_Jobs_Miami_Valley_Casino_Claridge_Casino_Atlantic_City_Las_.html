<p>Australia’s chief Minister and Labor Members of the Legislative Assembly, the ACT Labor Caucus, showed support for a campaign called “Bet’s Off. Game On.” The new campaign seeks to protect the public by removing TV gambling ads.</p>
<p>ACT Labor Backs Bet’s Off Game On</p>
<p>The recent announcement comes just in time for the Gambling Harm Awareness Week that is set between October 17 and October 23, 2022. Besides the ACT Labor Caucus, the Bet’s Off. Game On. campaign already enjoys broad support from the Salvation Army, the Alliance for Gambling Reform, the Australian Federal Police Association and Domestic Violence Crisis Centre. The initiative is also supported by ACTCOSS, Canberra Royals Rugby, Anglicare and Car Mechanical Services.</p>
<p>“All Australians should be able to live their lives free from the harm caused by gambling, yet the relentless bombardment of sports gambling advertising designed to exploit us all, and especially our children needs to stop.“ Carol Bennett, CEO of Alliance for Gambling Reform</p>
<p>Carol Bennett, Alliance for Gambling Reform’s CEO, commented on the topic saying that Australian residents should be able to enjoy life without being bombarded by gambling ads. Acknowledging that gambling ads are designed to exploit, she urged for the activity to stop. Last but not least, Bennett said: “This Gambling Harm Awareness Week, we stand with ACT Labor in the campaign for Bets off, Game On!”</p>
<p>“The unanimous support from ACT Labor is incredibly exciting.“ Dr. Marisa Paterson, member for Murrumbidgee in the ACT Legislative Assembly</p>
<p>Dr. Marisa Paterson, the ACT Legislative Assembly’s member for Murrumbidgee, revealed that the support from the ACT Labor caucus marks an exciting moment. She explained that this support reaffirms the need for legislative changes and the need to remove gambling ads from the sport.</p>
<p>The Bet’s Off. Game On. campaign kicked off last month on September 26. Now, in light of the Gambling Harm Awareness Week, the campaign will have a day for action set for Sunday, October 23, 2022.</p>
<p>Australians Support Removing TV Gambling Ads</p>
<p>Gambling represents a significant public health concern in Australia. Known as the world’s biggest losers, Australians spend millions on slots and other casino gambling every year. Similarly, many sports fans engage in sports betting, an activity that continues to spread with the help of gambling ads and sponsorships.</p>
<p>But while many enjoy casino gambling and sports betting, recent poll results from the Australia Institute reveal that 71% of Australians support removing gambling ads from TV. At the same time, exposure to gambling ads remains significantly high. According to Nielsen data released in April by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, last year, there were 148 ads broadcasted on free-to-air TV every weeknight between 6-8:30 PM, a primetime known as family viewing hours.</p>
