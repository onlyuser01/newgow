    <h1>High 5 Casino Sweeps Lightning Casino Aruba Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Windstar World Casino H</h1>

<p>Hacksaw Gaming was just provided a transactional waiver to operate in the state of New Jersey. Its entry into its second US jurisdiction was made possible by its partnership with the American gambling giant DraftKings.</p>
<p>Under the deal with DraftKings, Hacksaw Gaming will inject ten of its best games into the operator’s platform. DraftKings will be the exclusive distributor of these games in the state for the first two weeks of Hacksaw’s operation in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Hacksaw’s launch in New Jersey is expected to go live by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The agreement with DraftKings is a cornerstone of Hacksaw’s growth in the United States as the latter company remains bullish on growing its footprint in the highly lucrative North American region.</p>
<p>The opportunity to exclusively offer some of Hacksaw’s best games, on the other hand, will channel players toward DraftKings’ platform, helping it to solidify itself as a leading American operator.</p>
<p>Fans will be able to try out some of Hacksaw’s most exciting titles and see what the fuss is all about. Slots enthusiasts will get to try out hits such as Chaos Crew, OmNom, Mines Dare2Win and Boxes Dare2Win, among others.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming Hopes to Make Further Strides in the US</p>
<p>The upcoming launch in New Jersey will be made possible by Hacksaw’s existing agreement with Light &amp; Wonder. The company celebrated its growth on LinkedIn, saying:</p>
<p>With our new Transactional Waiver and prosperous partnership with Light &amp; Wonder, you’ll find your favorite Hacksaw Gaming friends in the States by December 2023! Hacksaw Gaming statement</p>
<p>Marcus Cordes, Hacksaw Gaming’s chief executive officer, said that his team is very proud to have secured a stable foothold in the United States.</p>
<p>Having secured such a significant presence in the US in 2023 is something we are incredibly proud of and our hard work takes form in our ever-increasing footprint. Marcus Cordes, CEO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s expansion in the US was further underpinned by its earlier foray into West Virginia, where it secured a supplier’s license earlier this year.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Hacksaw Gaming also launched in Columbia thanks to an agreement with Betplay.</p>
