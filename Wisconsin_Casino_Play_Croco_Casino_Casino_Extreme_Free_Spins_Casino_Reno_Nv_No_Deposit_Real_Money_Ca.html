<p>Scandal Breaks Over YouTube Stars Promoting Scam Gambling Site</p>

<p>Top internet personalities Jake Paul and Bryan “Ricegum” Le have been blasted this week for pushing a sketchy Polish gambling website written in broken English and making outrageous claims about the prizes being offered.</p>

<p>Mystery Brand is the latest in a new wave of websites offering “mystery boxes” — lucky-dip loot-box style crates that offer randomized physical prizes instead of digital ones.</p>
<p>The site invites users to “buy” mystery boxes for the chance to win. Prizes can be big-ticket items like Lamborghinis (or so the site claims), or goods worth just a few dollars, depending on your luck. Box prices range from $4.99 to hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>In YouTube videos watched by their millions of followers, Paul and Le are shown playing Mystery Brand, betting hundreds of dollars at a time. They start out winning small, but predictably soon amass thousands of dollars in tech and designer clothing.</p>
<p>Paul — the younger brother of internet A-lister Logan Paul — has 17.6 million subscribers on his channel, most of whom are young teenagers. Le has 10.8 million of the same demographic.</p>
<p>Prizes Go Missing</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several Reddit users claim to have gambled on Mystery Brand and not received prizes, although others said they had received theirs.</p>
<p>Curiously, the website’s t&amp;c’s state that, “During using the services of the website You may encounter circumstances in which Your won items will not be received [sic].”</p>
<p>The site certainly is a “mystery brand.” It offers no transparency about the company that owns it or where it’s based, other than to claim it is “subject to the laws and jurisdiction of Poland.”</p>
<p>If this is the case, it’s breaking those laws. Sports betting is the only form of online gambling permitted in Poland, and only then if an operator is granted a Polish gambling license. And if Mystery Brand has a gambling license from anywhere, it’s keeping mysteriously quiet about it.</p>
<p>Prime Bit of Real Estate</p>
<p>Mystery Brand’s purported big prizes — which include Lamborghinis and Rolls-Royces — sound dubious, but not nearly as dubious as its top prize.</p>
<p>Pay $12.99 to open the “Women’s Christmas Box” and it’s claimed you could win something called “Most Expensive Los Angeles Realty $250,000,000” which includes a picture of the priciest mansion ever to go on sale in America.</p>
<p>“Billionaire” — also known as 924 Bel Air Road — was built by real estate developer and designer Bruce Makowsky and initially went on the market for $250 million, before being relisted last year at a discounted $188 million.</p>
<p>According to The Daily Beast, the site initially listed the odds of winning the mansion — a prize it cannot possibly deliver — at 0.0000018 percent, before removing this claim earlier this week.</p>
