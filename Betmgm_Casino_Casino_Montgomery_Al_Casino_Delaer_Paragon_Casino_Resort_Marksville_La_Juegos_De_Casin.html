<p>The resulting company will have a greater geographical reach and will bring together two experienced teams</p>
<p>US Integrity and Odds On Compliance, two of the biggest sports betting and gambling compliance companies, have announced a monumental merger that will bring them under the same banner. The merger will allow the two parties to form the industry’s first global compliance and integrity solution.</p>
<p>US Integrity is a technology-driven sports wagering monitoring company that supplies clients with solutions that protect them from betting-related fraud. Odds On Compliance, on the other hand, excels in providing gambling and betting operators across Europe and the Americas with compliance solutions and consulting.</p>
<p>By joining forces, the two companies will bring together two experienced and talented teams with years of experience in the sector. This will allow the resulting body to better address the compliance needs of the ever-evolving gambling industry.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the new company will have a wider geographic reach and will continue delivering tailored and innovative solutions that help operators succeed sustainably.</p>
<p>The merger deal is expected to close in October 2023 and is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Looking Forward to Working Together</p>
<p>Following the merger, Odds On Compliance’s chief executive officer, Eric Frank, will be appointed as President of the newly formed company. Commenting on the agreement, he said that the merger attests to the two companies’ commitment to helping gambling operators navigate the complex regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>This fusion of strengths will enable us to offer a comprehensive suite of compliance and integrity technology products and services. Eric Frank, CEO, Odds On Compliance</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matt Holt, US Integrity’s chief executive officer, will re-assume CEO responsibilities at the combined company. He also shared his thoughts on the tie-up, expressing his excitement.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to unite the strengths of U.S. Integrity and Odds On Compliance to create a firm that is poised to redefine the standards of excellence in the sports betting and gambling compliance industry. Matt Holt, CEO, US Integrity</p>
<p>Earlier this year, US Integrity and Odds On Compliance joined forces to launch ProhiBet, a solution that helps companies prevent professional athletes and sports staff from wagering on sports. The solution hit the market last month and is already gaining significant momentum.</p>
