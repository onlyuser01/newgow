<p>Keep the Love Growing and the Wins Coming</p>
<p>Power of Love is played on a 5×4 grid that counts up to 80 payline. The action carries players in the middle of a retro love story in the 1950s. Players will get to experience the rockabilly music in the background, the inimitable Hollywood charm ruling over the scenery, and a red-colored background ruled by none other than Cupid watching over from a floating cloud.</p>
<p>The design features a Love Meter to the right while the dashing lady and her suave gentleman partner take over the stage on the reels packed with small tokens of love including hearts, diamonds, and roses.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy has expressed their delight to be able to launch the new game right in time for the upcoming holiday that celebrates love. McCarthy spoke about the mix of exciting features and the “love amorous” theme that players are prone to instantly fall in love with as soon as they start playing it.</p>
<p>Reel Life Games’ chief executive officer Andy Kniaz has also expressed their excitement to introduce a new game as part of the YG Masters program. Kniaz also spoke about their long-term partnership with Yggdrasil which has already enabled them to “create fantastic gaming experiences” while expressing confidence that the new game would turn into another high-performance title.</p>
<p>Power of Love Is Packed with Features</p>
<p>The slot keeps players engaged with a series of valuable features, including Love is in the Air, Love is Popping, and Love Grows. While playing the base game, the Power of Love symbol represents the Wild that increases players’ chances to create winning paylines.</p>
<p>When two halves of a heart are seen landing on consecutive reels, the Love Meter fills up. Once it reaches its full height, the special features become active on the selection screen.</p>
<p>The three features mentioned earlier can also be used in stacks and work together to generate massive win opportunities.</p>
<p>The Love is Popping feature will trigger between two and 20 Wild symbols to land on the reels while all the heart symbols will be turned into Wilds.</p>
<p>Love is in the Air is a symbol improvement feature that turns all selected symbols into matching symbols that are more valuable. The same feature also triggers two Wild symbols to land on the reels.</p>
<p>Love Grows is an expanding reel feature that will change the height of the reels and enable the grid to reach 5×8 in size while doubling the number of active paylines.</p>
<p>When three bonus symbols are seen landing during a spin, players receive seven Free Spins that can stack all three features for the remainder of the bonus round.</p>
<p>Last September, Yggdrasil and Reel Life Games teamed up to launch Midway Money, a festive slot with a huge payout potential.</p>
