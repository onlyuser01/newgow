    <h1>Casinos In New Hampshire Usa Casinos Reno Casino In Gulfport Pearl River Resort Casino Casino Erie P</h1>

<p>I opened my account with Golden Reels on September 11th, 2021. It has been verified twice.</p>
<p>On August 10th, 2022 I opened an account with Casino-X. These are two separate companies with different owners and acting under different licenses.</p>
<p>A few days later, I found out that even Golden Reels and Casino-X are separate companies, a part of their activities are being done by the same team and they share a clients’ database. I was limited by both companies to €0.20-0.30 and I received same document requests by both.</p>
<p>Golden Reels started "Source of funds" verification procedure. Except for the already required and necessary for the procedure e-wallet and bank statement, they asked for the following additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF of your Neteller loyalty points for all times</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an option in a Neteller account. I wrote an email addressed to Neteller and they replied that Neteller does not provide the technical ability of receiving loyalty points’ history in PDF format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification regarding relations and exchange transactions I have had with third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>In my Neteller account there are amounts I had received from other Neteller clients that are individuals. The aforementioned parties are not clients of Golden Reels that excludes the hypothesis and makes pointless their suspicions about multi accounting. All Neteller’s clients’ accounts are being permanently AML checked by Paysafe. So, the need of processing such checks by Golden reels is also unacceptable.</p>
<p>However, I have given a very detailed explanation about the nature of these transactions - I have attached Skype dialogues in which these transactions had been negotiated. I have also attached the counter-payments made by me via bank transfer with which I have paid for the amounts transferred to me via Neteller.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Statements linked to the third parties (Their source of funds)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been asked to provide bank statements of individuals (as mentioned before). I had no choice but to write to Neteller. Logically, Neteller declined providing such information in order to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<ul>
<li>Source of fund for cryptocurrency exchanger Kraken account since 15.08.21 (for the last 12 months)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not used crypto currencies for payments with Golden Reels. I have not even mentioned having an account with Kraken. Although, I found their request groundless and the information in it – inapplicable, I turned to Kraken and asked them to send me a PDF file with my transactions with them. Of course, I mentioned in my email that I need this information for a verification procedure with Golden Reels. My request itself led to Kraken’s security system turn on. They carefully checked my account for breaks. I also received some advices on how to improve my security. They even told me not to fall for any attempts to fishing and SPAM.</p>
<ul>
<li>A tax declaration, covering the period of the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>I turned to my accountant. They explained to me that according to our local legislation only politicians’ declarations are public and they are filled in a specific record. I am not a politician. Other people’s declarations are only available to bodies and institutions specified by the law and Golden Reels is not one of them. I.e. providing such declaration would breach the active legislation.</p>
<p>To summarize, I was asked for an information that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is impossible to retrieve for technical reasons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its retrieval would be in contradiction with the guidelines of GDPR;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its retrieval would be in contradiction with the privacy policy and security standards of a crypto exchange;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its retrieval is in contradictions with active legislation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I received a letter from Golden Reels telling me to upload my e-wallet and bank statement history to my account – i.e. the things that are in fact necessary and relevant to the "source of funds" verification. I completed that request and I saw a mark that the verification procedure was done.</p>
<p>So, I requested a withdrawal for a part of my balance. I exchanged a few emails with their support team about me not having enough rollover of my last deposit and how this would lead to paying withdrawal fees. In a result, I complete the required rollover in around 24 hours on different casino games. I requested a withdrawal of €2,000.</p>
<p>24 hours later I received an email from Golden Reels informing me I had breached their rules. They decided to return me €1,000 and confiscate the rest of my balance: €3,900.22.</p>
<p>I have sent an official complaint in which I categorically objected.</p>
<p>A week after this, they replied that they stand by their decision.</p>
<p>They paid me €1,000 and the remaining €3,900.22 they confiscated. That puts and an end to my dialogue with Golden Reels. Harmed and insulted by their overall attitude and dishonest decision, I have laid out the facts here. I rely on the authoritative intervention of the Casino Guru team to restore justice.</p>
