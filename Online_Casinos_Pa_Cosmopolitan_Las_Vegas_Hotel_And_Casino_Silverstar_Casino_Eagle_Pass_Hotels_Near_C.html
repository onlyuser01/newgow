    <h1>Online Casinos Pa Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Hotel And Casino Silverstar Casino Eagle Pass Hotels Near C</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm new here and I have a question regarding the cash drop via RANT'ers Quests at RANT Casino, maybe someone knows.</p>
<p>I received the â‚¬10 cash drop even though I didn't attend the event.</p>
<p>When I asked to delete the cash drop again, I was told by the live chat that this was not subject to any conditions. I got the answer from support that the conditions have already been met and the cash drop has already been converted to real money (so probably linked to conditions)</p>
<p>However, the description also states that the general bonus conditions apply and, if nothing is stated, you have to implement the bonus 35x.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this cash drop is subject to any conditions, such as max cash out or something?</p>
<p>My request to remove the cash drop, even though I didn't participate, is no longer being responded to.</p>
<p>I have a good sum on my account and of course I don't want them to cheer me on with any bonus with any payment conditions etc.</p>
<p>the drop happened while i was playing an ingame feature (sweet bonanza) and when the feature ended i stopped playing immediately and contacted the live chat.</p>
<p>you can track the drop from the history that was credited along with the win from the feature.</p>
<p>I didn't continue playing after that so they couldn't say I used it.</p>
<p>but my primary concern is whether the cash drop is subject to any conditions.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
