<p>Apparat Gaming, an iGaming developer of games founded in 2020 and focused on providing content to online casinos that stand out by virtue of their specific "German accent," has expanded with yet a new operator deal. As a result, Apparat will provide mycasino with a range of its excellent slot games that will power the experience for players of the Grand Casino Luzern’s digital brand.</p>
<p>Through mycasino, Apparat Gaming slots will appear across the entire country as players access an innovative type of content. Apparat Gaming has been building up its products for the past few years, and it has already enjoyed a very strong uptake in player adoption and operator partnerships.</p>
<p>As Apparat Gaming likes to say, its "eye candy" slots come with "absolutely no sense of humor," which is clearly meant in jest. In reality, the company’s games span a variety of imaginative themes, excellent graphics, and solid mathematics that make the titles work nicely across any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The studio also insists that its products are marked by a high quality, reliability and commitment to players and partners to significantly strengthen the available games in the iGaming sector in every jurisdiction where Apparat Gaming is present. The first games to arrive at the casino include The Warlock’s Book, Heimdall’s Horn, King of the Vikings, 40 Sevens, and Total Eclipse.</p>
<p>More games will be arriving as part of the collaboration, which will feature future releases by the company. Commenting on this opportunity, Apparat Gaming Chief Product Officer Martin Frindt said that the company was excited to bring a "German flavor to the beautiful country."</p>
<p>"We couldn't have found a better partner for our launch in Switzerland than mycasino, the online casino of Grand Casino Luzern, located in the heart of Switzerland. And from here we want to win the hearts of Swiss players," Frindt added talking about the significance of the partnership with Grand Casino Luzern and its online brand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Swiss online casinos have been the focus of supplier interest. Companies such as Bragg Gaming Group have launched with Swiss Casinos in the country in February. Pragmatic Play, another prominent supplier, has also signed with Swiss Casinos in March. Grand Casino Luzern is now keen to continue building up its footprint and offer in the market.</p>
