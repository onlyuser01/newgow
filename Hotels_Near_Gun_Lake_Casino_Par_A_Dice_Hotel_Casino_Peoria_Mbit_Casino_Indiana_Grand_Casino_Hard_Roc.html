    <h1>Hotels Near Gun Lake Casino Par A Dice Hotel Casino Peoria Mbit Casino Indiana Grand Casino Hard Roc</h1>

<p>Dear apturbo,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.crazeplay.com/bonus-terms:</p>
<p>"Bonus money offered in standard and reload , in whose terms it is not stated otherwise, is not cashable. After 40x deposit + bonus wagering is completed, you will be able to withdraw only the real winnings and the money from your real-money balance, while bonus amount will void. The maximum cashable cap with every bonus claimed is 5000 EUR (or the equivalent in any other currency) for deposits of 50 EUR or more (or the equivalent in any other currency). Any deposit match bonus promotions triggered with deposits below 50 EUR (or the equivalent in any other currency) will be subject to a max cap win of x 10 the amount of the original deposit."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Please understand that it is nothing unusual to have maximum cash out applied to any promotional winnings. Do I understand correctly that your withdrawal has been requested on the 6th of June?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
