<p>Reasons Why Cory Sandhagen Is Favored by the Bookies</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see Cory Sandhagen as the favorite in the headliner fight of UFC Fight Night 210, giving the odds of -215. There are several reasons why this is the case, starting with the fact that he’s a former interim UFC Bantamweight Championship challenger.</p>
<p>He fought the interim title fight against Petr Yan in October 2021. Sandhagen lost the fight, but only after the judges voted in his rival’s favor. It was a hell of a fight, which was eventually voted Fight of the Night.</p>
<p>The loss to Yan was Sandhagen’s second straight loss and his third in the UFC. Almost a year after the bout, he’s getting back inside the octagon to try and get back onto the winning track. The man standing in his way is Chinese fighter Song Yadong.</p>
<p>Can Song Yadong Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>This is the first time Song Yadong is fighting a five-round bout, which could mean trouble for the Chinse fighter. The thing is that he’s not known for his stamina. Although 12 of his 27 fights went the distance, he lost four of those by points. Almost every time, Song did okay in the early stages of the fight only to get blasted by the opponent near the end.</p>
<p>Still, his most recent loss happened when he lost the first two rounds to Kyler Phillips, while putting on a fine performance in the third round. Unfortunately for him, he won the battle but not the war.</p>
<p>Since that loss, however, Song went on to win the following three fights, beating Casey Kenney by split decision and getting a KO/TKO win against Julio Arce and Marlon Moraes.</p>
<p>Cory Sandhagen vs. Song Yadong Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that this is going to be Fight of the Night. Both fighters are hungry for success and both of them have plenty of weapons in their arsenal. Cory Sandhagen is probably better than Song Yadong, but the difference isn’t huge, meaning that anything might happen here.</p>
<p>Picks: Cory Sandhagen to win</p>
