<p>Ancient Egypt Classic review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The Ancient Egyptians, when they built their monuments, could not have predicted that their legacy would be unending variations of slot machines which hijacked their animal-headed gods and pictographic writings to generate slots like Ancient Egypt Classic.</p>
<p>The formula here is pretty standard, ancient Egyptian architecture for the background, Arabic woodwind on the soundtrack and a mix of hieroglyphs, ankhs and a version of Cleopatra that owes more to MGM than history.</p>
<p>It does little to distinguish itself from the similar-looking Book of Ra and its various knockoffs, including the immensely popular Book of Dead, but it is hard to knock Ancient Egypt Classic for following suit on such a well established example of the genre.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are serviceable. They do not especially stand out in the genre, but in some ways that is Ancient Egypt Classic’s intention. It is seeking to look as much like the other ancient Egypt slots out there as possible and thereby capture some of their market.</p>
<p>The rest of the design is good, animations and sound effects work well together, and the music is unobtrusive and sets the scene perfectly.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game of Ancient Egypt Classic is a five reel by three row slot with ten win lines.</p>
<p>It is a pretty standard slot in most ways with a few small exceptions like a combined Scatter/Wild symbol.</p>
<p>It has a free spin bonus which is where the biggest wins can be made and during which there is an expanding symbol feature (see below for details).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Scarab symbol serves as both a Wild, substituting for all other symbols, and a Scatter, paying out from any position regardless of winlines. Should you hit three in one spin they pay out 2 times your bet per spin, going up to 20 times for four Scarabs and 200 for five.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more of the Scarabs will also trigger the Free Spin feature. During this feature, you receive ten free spins and a random symbol is chosen to become an Expanding Symbol.</p>
<p>The Expanding symbol pays out like a Scatter during the Free Spins and when it is is part of a win it will expand to fill all three rows of its reel.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.47%, a little bit higher than our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is very high, which works perfectly with our preferred slot machine strategies which largely target high volatility slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If you liked the Book of Dead but were put off by its huge success, this could be the perfect slot for you.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptian theme is well realised, the gameplay classic and solid, and the visuals are up to the standard you would hope for.</p>
<p>Couple this with its decent return to player and high volatility and we are on board for a holiday back in time.</p>
