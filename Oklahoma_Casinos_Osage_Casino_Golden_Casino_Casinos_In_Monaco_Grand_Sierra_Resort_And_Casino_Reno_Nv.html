    <h1>Oklahoma Casinos Osage Casino Golden Casino Casinos In Monaco Grand Sierra Resort And Casino Reno Nv</h1>

<p>Hello Casino-Guru team,</p>
<p>I am contacting you because Platincasino is not responding to my emails or chat requests.</p>
<p>This seems to be the case based on the complaints from other players in this forum.</p>
<p>My emails are completely ignored, and when I manage to connect with someone in the chat, they are unable to view my emails or provide any significant assistance.</p>
<p>I have been a gambling addict for 12 years (with six-figure losses) and my account was blocked during the issuance of the Curacao license. Additionally, I am blacklisted by Oasis (a cross-provider barrier system) and should not have been permitted to deposit funds with this operator. I am also banned from all Hollycorn-NV operators, of which Latiform BV is a subsidiary.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2023, I emailed Platincasino requesting my account be blocked because of my gambling addiction. I had also requested the same when they were operating under a different license.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have requested a transaction list of my deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>Earlier on December 15, I contacted customer service via email regarding a bonus offer but received no response.</p>
<p>After receiving no response and losing 1550 euros in 2-3 days, I reached out to a chat representative who finally blocked my account.</p>
<p>Why are my email requests being ignored?</p>
<p>All I am asking now is for a transaction list of my deposits and withdrawals to be emailed to me so that I can file a lawsuit against Platincasino.</p>
<p>Please urge Platincasino to send me a transaction list of my payments in accordance with data protection law (GDPR).</p>
<p>I have tried this, but to no avail.</p>
<p>My lawyer needs this information to proceed with the lawsuit against Platincasino.</p>
<p>I can provide multiple proofs regarding my player restriction and the various emails I've sent to customer service, but it won't matter since Platincasino will likely refuse to refund my losses.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to resolve this legally.</p>
<p>Could you please request Platincasino to send me a payment transaction file?</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
