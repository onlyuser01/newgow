    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Lake Tahoe Broken Bow Ok Choctaw Casino Ameristar Casino Restaurants Murphy N</h1>

<p>The Seminole Casino Coconut Creek will hold a Hard Rock Heals Foundation Charity Tournament to help with the relief efforts in war-torn Ukraine</p>
<p>The tournament is slated for Saturday, April 8 and will get underway at 11 am local time in Coco Poker. The event will have a $200 buy-in and a prize pool of guaranteed $10,000. Participants and guests may also expect special bounties, which the tournament organizers confirm.</p>
<p>Poker Can Help the Ukrainian Relief Effort</p>
<p>Registration will begin on April 8 at 9 am in Coco Poker and the event expects a good turn up. Coco Poker is a smoke-free location, which currently hosts 30 tables and is one of South Floridaâ€™s best private luxury private salons.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Seminole Gaming CEO, chairman of Hard Rock International, and chairman of Hard Rock Digital, Jim Allen, said that the organization was adamant to demonstrate its support for the victims of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Allen said that the tournament would seek to offer help to thousands of people who are fleeing the war, or have been displaced or otherwise denied basic services and goods. Ukrainian children and families have been injured or suffered severely financially, Allen explained. He similarly said that the death toll was even more devastating.</p>
<p>The tournament is just part of the relief efforts that have been going on for a while now, with organizations and representatives of the gambling industry raising considerable funds to assist Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the country itself, President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a new decree with which he stamped out a number of gambling sites, issuing a 50-year ban against at least 120 companies and 280 individuals.</p>
<p>Zelensky alleges that these companies and people have been working to secure the interests of Russia or preyed on the Ukrainian people through the launch of illegitimate gambling products. Interestingly, at least one of the companies that was banned had been known to raise money for Ukraine.</p>
