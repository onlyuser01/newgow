<p>BGaming has launched Luck&amp;Magic, the first release of August with 96% RTP, Bonus Games, and unique face-down cards used to replace standard reels</p>
<p>The creative provider of iGaming content known as the crypto gambling pioneer, BGaming, has announced the addition of a fresh title to its impressive portfolio that currently includes over 100 video slots, video poker, and lottery games.</p>
<p>Luck and Magic is the first August release on a string of new releases announced by the studio with bells and whistles for the month. After leaving a highly lucrative month of July behind it, the studio is getting ready for the release of three brand new slots, with Luck&amp;Magic on top of the list, followed by the upcoming launches of Dice Million, a dice-themed game, and Savage Buffalo Spirit MEGAWAYS, the improved version of an already iconic release.</p>

<p>Enter the Fantasy Realm and Let the Magical Creatures Decide Your Fate</p>
<p>Luck &amp; Magic invites players to set foot into a fascinating fantasy realm and let their fate be decided by magical creatures based on some of the most popular characters and themes in iconic video games.</p>
<p>The game features a one-of-a-kind face-down card system used to replace standard reels present in most slots. Once players hit the Spin button, all cards turn face-up to uncover all the symbols and values underneath them. This means players no longer have to worry about checking the game’s paytable.</p>
<p>The innovative feature is accompanied by a Bonus game based on Bonus symbols which add even more mystery to the action on the grid. The wise wizard represents the Bonus symbol and is seen watching over the reels.</p>
<p>Landing at least three Bonus symbols on the first, second, or third reels will initiate the Bonus Game. There, players are asked to select one of five available cards that, in return, receive a multiplier won prior to the rest of the cards starting to flip to reveal their values.</p>
<p>Players can also opt for the Bonus Buy feature and instantly enter the Bonus game at any random moment.</p>
<p>BGaming’s co-chief product officer, Yulia Aliakseeva, explained the studio’s vision to turn gambling into gaming, further adding that Luck&amp;Magic invites players to “experience a card game and slot all-in-one.” Aliakseeva also spoke about the “highly-detailed artwork” used by the studio to boost players’ experiences.</p>
<p>At the end of February, SkillOnNet announced a partnership with BGaming with the latter adding a range of its cutting-edge slots, arcade-style games, and provably fair experiences to the white-label and full turnkey casino software provider’s partner operators.</p>
<p>Last June, BGaming launched its products with Platincasino, further strengthening its footprint across Europe.</p>
