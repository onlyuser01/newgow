<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) wants a united front against offshore gambling in the United States. The regulator, which oversees iGaming and sports wagering in the Great Lakes States, is one of the jurisdictions to speak up against the lack of stronger action against the black market which continues to operate from beyond the country's borders and target consumers.</p>
<p>The issue has been already highlighted by the American Gaming Association, a trade body that has been a passionate advocate for ensuring that consumers only use and turn to regulated gambling websites in the United States. The MGCB believes that iGaming and sports wagering legalization is going at a breakneck pace and the time has come to also address the role of offshore gambling.</p>
<p>In a letter dated April 28, MGCB Executive Director Henry Williams writes to Attorney General Merrick Garland and asks him to make sure that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) does more to address what Williams calls as the "threat of offshore illegal gambling." Williams argues that state regulators are not able to enact sweeping reforms or measures that may disrupt the reach of offshore gambling.</p>
<p>For this to happen, the DOJ would need to step in. Williams has also asked his colleagues from several states, including Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Louisiana, and Illinois to also sign the letter which was sent to the AG’s office.</p>
<p>"In Michigan, strict laws and rules govern internet gaming and sports betting and provide consumer protections, promote confidence and ensure fair and honest gaming," the letter explains with Williams vowing that the MGCB would help the DOJ in any way possible to ensure that offshore gaming enterprise stop flouting US law.</p>
<p>A passionate argument as part of the letter was delivered by Nevada Gaming Control Board ChairmanKirk D. Hendrick who spoke of the potential risks that these offshore gambling sites already posted to consumers. Among those were no guarantees that players will be paid and when they do – that fair payouts will happen.</p>
<p>Age verifications are often ignored, D. Hendrick argued in his part of the letter and said that it was within DOJ’s remit to stop this from happening. Other reasons, such as loss of state tax revenue were also put forward. Williams argued that the MGCB is offering robust testing and fairness guarantees that are not matched by offshore gambling operators.</p>
<p>Even when local regulators can detect rogue operators, they have limited options to react, as offshore gambling operations answer to no authority, he concluded his letter.</p>
