    <h1>Northwoods Casino Washington Borgata Casino In Atlantic City Downstream Casino Resort Buffalo Thunde</h1>

<p>My account balance is negative (-104$) and PokerStars refused to update it to the zero. Because of it all my tourneys tickets was expired and there's some bonus coins on the account which can be transferable to USD immediately. I was making deposits with my visa deposit card from FNB bank (personal checking account). When I log in to my account some time later I saw the reason of my issue. I know for sure, that account I closed after 10-12 days after I played there. In the bank they checked that there's no pending transactions. And even if any will happen after I leave the branch, bank will send it by mail with final bill.</p>
<p>Pokerstars (PS)says that my money never left my account.</p>
<p>Than I asked them: Did you try to charge my account?</p>
<p>PS: We don't do it. It's our payment processor- Paramount. And they provide information about 5 transactions that they don't receive payments.</p>
<p>Me: Please, provide me information when I did deposits and when your payment processor said that couldn't complete transactions. I requested to investigate that, but they ignore it.</p>
