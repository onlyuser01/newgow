    <h1>Four Winds Casino South Bend Indiana Caesars Casino Login Beste Online Casino Cripple Creek Hotels A</h1>

<p>Sports-oriented customer-engagement platform OtherLevels has negotiated to extend its partnership with the gambling operator Golden Nugget Online Gaming. The agreement will see the two parties collaborate for two more years.</p>
<p>The Parties Extended Their Partnership by Two Years</p>
<p>OtherLevels and Golden Nugget’s relationship first began in 2015 when the two scored their first deal. The latter saw OtherLevels power Golden Nugget’s offerings with its omnichannel marketing and real-time messaging services. Thanks to the customer engagement platform, the operator managed to improve its client acquisition, engagement, and retention.</p>
<p>OtherLevels also helped Golden Nugget propagate its offerings in Michigan, where it recently launched online live dealer table games.</p>
<p>With the deal extended for two more years, OtherLevels and Golden Nugget hope to continue their fruitful collaboration and double down on their efforts to establish the operator as one of the most influential ones in the states of New Jersey and Michigan. Furthermore, the expanded contract means that OtherLevels will be able to support the operator as it expands in West Virginia.</p>
<p>OtherLevels’ cutting-edge marketing solutions will continue boosting Golden Nugget’s performance. With OtherLevels’ backing, the operator will be able to decrease the time it spends on improving its audience reach and focus more on various campaigns and content strategies.</p>
<p>Both Are Glad to Continue Working Together</p>
<p>The two parties used the opportunity to talk about their excitement by the opportunity to continue their conjoined operations.</p>
<p>Samir Banerjee, the director of marketing for Golden Nugget Online Gaming, spoke on the deal. For him, the Golden Nugget’s continued partnership with OtherLevels is a testament to the operator’s commitment to always provide its casino patrons with “a personalized messaging experience that is best-in-class”.</p>
<p>Brendan O’Kane, the chief executive officer of OtherLevels is delighted by the opportunity to continue working together with Golden Nugget. O’Kane explained that the gambling operator has been a “valued strategic partner” for six years and the whole OtherLevels team is looking forward to expanding its relationship with the company.</p>
<p>O’Kane added that OtherLevels is glad to be able to continue supporting Golden Nugget Online Gaming as the latter expands into new markets across the United States. O’Kane concluded by talking about the partners’ future plans:</p>
<p>“Over the next two years, we will leverage our cross-channel messaging and optimized content delivery capabilities to ensure that personalized, relevant content is reaching the right players on the right channel at precisely the right time.”</p>
<p>Golden Nugget is known as a brand that carefully selects its allies. In October, the operator strengthened its partnership with Scientific Games to boost its offerings in three states.</p>
<p>Just now, the operator’s owner, Tilman Fertitta, announced that he is looking to sell $5.5 billion worth of bonds in order to refinance the company’s debt.</p>
