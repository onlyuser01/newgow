    <h1>Angel Of The Winds Casino Redstag Casino Southpoint Hotel Casino Casinos In Laughlin Nv Robert De Ni</h1>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We see that the winnings were confiscated as the gameplay broke the general terms and conditions:</p>
<p>"10. Betting Rules</p>
<p>10.1. The casino expects you to follow the rules of each game while playing at the casino. We reserve the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate the winnings and bonuses for violation of the Betting Rules.</p>
<p>10.3. Placing total bets equal to or greater than 30% of the value of the deposit currently in play is prohibited. Acquiring an in-game Buy Feature to trigger free spins for a buy-in cost equal to or over the 30% max bet limit is considered as irregular play."</p>
<p>On 20\04\2021 Teija started her gaming session with a deposit of 50 euros. At 11:47 (casino recorded time) she commenced her gameplay and placed bets on Faerie Spells (NJP) - a slots game. She breached the 30% betting rules when she placed a bet with the amount of €49.50 Euros on the said slots game.</p>
<p>Please be advised that we view "over-betting" as a violation of the service we provide, and an attempt to deal unfairly with us. If a player attempts that, confiscation of the winnings accrued is in order. Of course, you might claim that you were uninformed and that you meant no harm. We are always careful to return to the balance the deposit from which the confiscated winnings were accrued, even though, technically, we don’t have to do that.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the withdrawal was declined and winnings were confiscated. Evidence to support our claims can be provided.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we would like to point out the fact that Teija had deposited 30 Euros on the 22nd of April, she had gained some wins by playing accordingly to the T&amp;C and submitted a withdrawal request, it was paid later on the 26th of April.</p>
<p>The Casino understands the player’s frustration for the voided winnings from the previous withdrawal, but it is imperative that all players comply with the terms and conditions that a player agrees to upon opening an account.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nordi Casino</p>
