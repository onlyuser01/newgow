<p>Fantasma Games, a maker of slots, has signed a deal with Scientific Games to make a number of exclusive games available on the tier one provider’s feature-rich OpenGamingTM platform.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games Signes and Agreement with Scientific Games</p>
<p>The agreement will expand Fantasma’s global scope by making the games produced under the agreement available to all operators on the Scientific Games network, as well as in key markets like the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America.</p>
<p>Fantasma intends to design and produce the first game for release in the autumn of 2021, with this and all other games released under the collaboration being exclusive to the OpenGaming platform for at least 18 months and up to four years.</p>
<p>This will enable operators powered by Scientific Games such as Parimatch to provide players with games that are designed to provide an exciting, enjoyable, and highly engaging experience, enabling them to distinguish themselves from their competitors through content and better attract and retain players.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games was established in 2017 and has quickly proved itself as one of the most popular slot developers thanks to its philosophy of making slots beyond gambling and provide an outstanding one-handed experience when played from a mobile device.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games Vision</p>
<p>Commercial director of Fantasma Games, Fredrik Johansson, said: “We are both happy and proud of the fact that as a relatively young company, we are now able to offer our games in North America and other key regulated markets around the world.”</p>
<p>Johansson continued his statement adding that Fantasma Games wants to reach as many people as possible, and this deal, along with Scientific Games’ global operations, allows them to do so. Fantasma is hard at work on a variety of new game titles, and the company hopes to share more of them through this collaboration in the future.</p>
<p>Partnership Director at Scientific Games Digital, Steve Mayes, commented saying that Scientific Games’ goal is to continue to push the world’s most powerful aggregation site with leading consumers and game makers in every major controlled industry, collaborating on the creation of cutting-edge entertainment that players love while still being able to play responsibly using the company’s responsible gambling resources.</p>
<p>Fantasma Games is a young, ambitious studio whose ethos and vision complement the OpenGaming portfolio perfectly. Scientific Games is ecstatic about this collaboration and is looking forward to introducing the types of games that they believe their fans would enjoy.</p>
