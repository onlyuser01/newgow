    <h1>Casinos In Alabma Four Queens Casino Hotel Royal Ace Casino Casino Free Slot Games Casinos In New Or</h1>

<p>Hell Christie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submtting your complaint and I'm really sorry to hear about your issue with Grande Vegas Casino. Please allow me to ask you a few more question to clarify the case as much as possible.</p>
<p>Was the winnings of $3000 generated from real money or from bonus aswell? How long was the withdrawal pending before it got canceled? Was it your first withdrawal request in the casino? Is there any balance left on your casino account?</p>
<p>We've exprienced cases like this in the past where the withdrawals got canceled due to accepting a bonus, but based on our Fair gambling codex, the winnings generated before accepting the bonus should be fully paid out to the player. The question is now if you have any balance left there or you played and lost it all. If you have already lost it, I'm not sure we will be able to do anything with. If you still have it, we agree with you that you should get all your money won from before taking the bonus.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your answer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
