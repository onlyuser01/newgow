    <h1>Four Queens Casino Fremont Street Las Vegas Nv Monopoly Casino Casino In Wisconsin Blue Chip Casino</h1>

<p>Dear JMORE66,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Self-exclusion:</p>
<p>For a few customers gambling might become a serious problem. We offer a self-exclusion option that can be easily implemented by a customer’s request. If you would like to self-exclude yourself from accessing our products, please either contact Customer Services or choose to self-exclude here. You will need to specify the period of time you wish to be self-excluded for, ranging from six months to a permanent exclusion. The process and implications of self exclusion are listed below:</p>
<p>If you request this via Customer Services, an agent will reply and ask you to confirm your request. This is done to ensure that the request was not submitted through someone who gained unauthorised access to your account.</p>
<p>Once the self-exclude period begins you will not be able to access your account. Any funds in your account will be withdrawn and returned to you in accordance with our terms and conditions.</p>
<p>During the self-exclusion period we will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that you are removed from our marketing materials. This does not mean that we are able to ensure that you will not be exposed to untargeted and general advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>At the end of the self-exclusion period you may contact us and request that you are granted access to our gaming products. You must request this change in person (in person, telephone, skype, IM are acceptable), email contact is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Kindly note, that only upon clear ‘self-exclusion’ request will your account be suspended as per the agreed time. Otherwise all accounts are in status ‘closed’ and can be reopened any time upon customer’s request."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to support@nordiscasino.com. In this way, you’ll have proof of such action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
