    <h1>Casino Machines For Sale Boomtown Casino Hotel Map Of Ac Casinos Best Casino In Laughlin Chumash Cas</h1>

<p>I recently had an issue with a slot. I was playing a game (sweet bonanza) and I had lost a lot so I decided to raise my bet and somehow I spun into a bonus on the first spin. The bonus began and I had started to win a decent amount. Halfway through the game froze, I had experienced this before but usually it’s not a problem and I’d just need to refresh and it would fix. This time I refreshed but when I refreshed the bonus was gone. None of the winnings were credited to my account &amp; I had lost the money that the spin which got me into the bonus cost. After discussing with the slot provider they told me that it was the casino’s responsibility so I contacted duelbits. They informed me that the round "didn’t play" on their end so there’s nothing they can do. I really would like this to be resolved, I have attached an image at the end of a screenshot of the bonus &amp; where it froze. As a result of all of this, I ended up gambling all of my money. This was very out of character with deposits and bet sizes bigger than I ever had and I’ve been informed that the casino should have had a system in place to recognise a problem like this and stop me. But that is another problem, not sure if you’re going to be able to help but I would greatly appreciate if you could. It’s completely unfair for me to lose to someone else’s mistakes, whether genuine mistakes or not. Can it also be noted I’m pretty sure the username for the Casino is correct but I’m not 100%. I can’t check because as a result of all of this I closed my account with them. Also, I entered £6000 as the disputed amount but this is only what I knew I had lost, it could have been a lot more depending on the outcome.</p>
