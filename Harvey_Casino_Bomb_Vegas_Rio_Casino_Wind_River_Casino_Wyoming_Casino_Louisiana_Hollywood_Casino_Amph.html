    <h1>Harvey Casino Bomb Vegas Rio Casino Wind River Casino Wyoming Casino Louisiana Hollywood Casino Amph</h1>

<p>While the United States is debating whether the exemption on a public ban on smoking should apply to casinos, the captains of the seven seas have made up their mind</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean International, a company that provides cruise ship travels and hospitality services, including on-board casinos, has decided against smoking onboard. This decision impacts three Oasis-class ships that have seen their jazz clubs converted into smoke-free casinos. Royal Caribbean previously decided to suspend smoking across its other ships back when COVID-19 was around as a measure to improve air filtration and suppress the virus’ chances of spreading.</p>
<p>Building the First Three Oasis Ship Casinos for Royal Caribbean</p>
<p>This happened during the ships’ last service, and the Oasis of the Seas Allure of the Seas, and Harmony of the Seas are ready to welcome all players who are interested in playing in a smoke-free environment. Smokers may still light up, but outside the premises and on the designated areas of the ship. Trimline project manager Billy Morton, whose company took care of the refurbishment and redesign of the sections of the ships, had this to say on the occasion of the latest conversions:</p>
<p>It’s been an absolute pleasure to work with Royal Caribbean on these conversions. The team has worked tirelessly to ensure that the work is delivered to the highest standards, and we are delighted with the results. Trimline project manager Billy Morton</p>
<p>Each of the casinos has been called “Jazz on 4,” and they are advertised as clubs that feature a main show lounge. Royal Caribbean has done some meticulous planning to ensure that the redesigned spaces and areas would make sense and fit machines as well as sufficient amenities to make the experience rewarding for players.</p>
<p>The company has been also working with various third parties, including IT specialists and data experts to ensure that operations across the entire ship can continue as intended. Royal Caribbean is confident that the smoke-free casinos will lead to an even stronger customer experience and a greater level of satisfaction among customers staying onboard.</p>
<p>Casinos to Become More Permanent Part of the Cruise Experience</p>
<p>These three ships will now be the litmus test for Royal Caribbean. The company has other Oasis-class vessels it may experiment with, but for the time being, Symphony of the Seas, Wonder of the Seas, and even the still-in-development Utopia of the Seas – are going to preserve their original look with no mentions of a casino.</p>
<p>However, the newest Oasis ship in the world, Wonder of the Seas already features a Golden Room by default, which is essentially the casino. In other words, cruise lines and the manufacturers of these ships may already be waking up to the fact that casinos could make a good hospitality experience for travelers on their ships. Royal Caribbean has also been expanding through some strategic purchases, including the buyout of Genting Group’s Endeavor cruise ship in 2022.</p>
