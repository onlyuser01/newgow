<p>PlayOJO has launched a new advertising campaign designed to increase the brand’s presence in regulated markets it’s active in, specifically the United Kingdom. The company focuses on two specific verticals, to wit bingo and casino products and it has worked with McCann Demand marketing agency to ensure that the new advertising campaign will resonate with target audiences.</p>
<p>“Feel the Fun” with New PlayOJO Marketing Campaign</p>
<p>The new campaign revolves around “Madame OJO,” which is a unique mascot character crafted by the company in an attempt to communicate the iGaming “joie de vivre” which the brand aptly calls the “OJO feeling.” This is the feeling players get when they access PlayOJO to play bingo or casino games, the company argues.</p>
<p>The campaign is launching with a new tagline, “Feel the Fun,” which seeks to take PlayOJO’s offer even further with audiences. The casino is prepared to take the experience even further, marketing some of its assets, such as the 50 no-wagering free spins which are attributed to a player’s account on their first deposit.</p>
<p>There is a money back on every game and other promotions that make the experience even more fun. The campaign has launched in the UK and is communicated via TV and digital platforms, as well as other markets where PlayOJO is available. Next, the campaign will be launched in Spain.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity PlayOJO global head of brand Peter Bennett said that the brand was a destination where placers could have fun and stay entertained. Bennett added:</p>
<p>We want PlayOJO to become the brand famous for making the player experience as fun as possible, for doing more of the stuff we know players love. PlayOJO global head of brand Peter Bennett</p>
<p>He confirmed that the company was excited about the new creative approach they have developed in collaboration with McCann Demand to bring even more worthwhile experiences to players.</p>
<p>In May, OJO butted heads with the Advertising Standards Authority which deemed the company’s “Hot or Cold” ads to be misleading.</p>
