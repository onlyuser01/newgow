<p>The victim of Friday’s assault at Sam’s Town Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall was believed to be in his 90s, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Details on his injuries were not immediately available.</p>
<p>The two robbers were described as being in their 20s. They were last seen running away from the garage, located off Boulder Highway.</p>
<p>Police were notified about the robbery at about 12:20 pm, shortly after the holdup. The bandits were still on the loose as of Friday evening.</p>
<p>Sam’s Town is known as a local’s casino. It is operated by Boyd Gaming.</p>
<p>Casino Parking Garages Risky for Crime</p>
<p>In recent months, casino parking garages have been at risk for robberies and other crimes in Las Vegas and across the nation, according to a Casino.org report.</p>
<p>It is not surprising these crimes take place in parking garages,” said Brad Bonnell, a principal of the Hotel Security Group. He explained to Casino.org in September that, given their “isolation” and how they provide criminals “anonymity, predators know that casino-hotel garages … [have] well-funded tourists.”</p>
<p>For example, in October, Palm Springs, Calif. police officers shot two robbery suspects as they tried to speed away from a parking garage at Agua Caliente Casino. One had just allegedly robbed a woman at gunpoint.</p>
<p>That incident followed a September shooting at a parking garage at the same gaming property. The earlier violent attack at the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians’-owned casino was investigated as an attempted homicide.</p>
<p>Also, in August a fatal shooting took place at an Emerald Queen Casino garage in Tacoma, Wash. In July, another fatal shooting occurred at Winner’s Way parking garage in Florida’s Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers were searching for a robber who targeted the elderly in holdups at casino parking lots or garages, KLAS, a Las Vegas TV station, reported.</p>
<p>The suspect in those crimes was described as being between 20 and 30 years old. He was believed to be Hispanic.</p>
<p>Typically, he would drive into a lot or garage, look for a solitary elderly person, and then shove them onto the pavement. He then stole pocketbooks or other belongings, the report said.</p>
<p>He tried to use their stolen debit or credit cards to get money.</p>
<p>Metro Police Increase Holiday Patrols</p>
<p>In response to an uptick in local crime, Las Vegas Metro police have initiated a selective enforcement operation known as “Operation Persistent Pressure.” Extra police have been on patrol in certain areas of Las Vegas popular with tourists, such as The Strip.</p>
<p>In the past, Metro police encouraged pedestrians in garages to be aware of their surroundings. Often, casino security can escort guests back to their cars parked in garages.</p>
