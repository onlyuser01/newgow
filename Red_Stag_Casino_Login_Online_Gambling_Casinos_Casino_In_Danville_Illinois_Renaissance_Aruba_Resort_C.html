<p>The network solutions company continues to conquer new markets, in line with its first-to-market approach</p>
<p>Continent 8 Technologies, the world’s largest iGaming data center and global network solutions provider, has secured a new license in Massachusetts.

As a result, Continent 8 is now a certified vendor that can provide local operators with its solutions.</p>
<p>Operators and suppliers in Massachusetts can now access the provider’s full solutions portfolio. Continent 8 offers managed hosting, connectivity and security-related tools, including hybrid could deployments with partners such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Before securing approval from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, Continent 8 went through a data center site selection with the center going live in October 2022. This move helped the company ensure that it will be able to offer the best infrastructure solutions in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Massachusetts is now live in 26 US states, with its offerings available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and many more markets. The company boasts a global network that spans more than 90 locations across four continents.</p>

<p>Bruce added that Continent 8 has taken an “ambitious first-to-market approach” in the United States, seeking to provide customers with key solutions early on, helping them headstart their journey in each state.</p>
<p>This, combined with our award-winning and tailored solutions and services, and our 25 years of experience, sets us aside from other providers and is why we have become the go-to infrastructure provider for so many online businesses. David Bruce, innovation director, Continent 8 Technologies</p>
<p>The approach in question has cemented Continent 8 as one of the leading providers of iGaming network solutions. The company’s products are used by more than 80% of the operators on the EGR US Power Rankings 2022.</p>
