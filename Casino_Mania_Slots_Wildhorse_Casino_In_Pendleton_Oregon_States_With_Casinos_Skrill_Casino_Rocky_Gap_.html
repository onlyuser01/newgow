<p>DFS Operator PrizePicks Expands to Alabama</p>
<p>The largest independently owned Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) operator, PrizePicks announced today that it expanded its presence in the United States. The operator received a license and entered Alabama. As a result, now PrizePicks operates in 31 jurisdictions across the US. Furthermore, the company is now serving more than 60% of the US population, including top markets such as California, Florida, Texas, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Besides its Alabama entry, PrizePicks plans to continue its US expansion. Later this year, the company expects to receive a license in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana. These are in fact the last three states that PrizePicks would need to cement its presence in the South. Once this is done, the operator is going to serve 120 million people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PrizePicks has already established partnerships with multiple professional brands and athletes in the South region. PrizePicks’ partners include Major League Baseball Atlanta Braves as well as Atlanta’s biggest sports franchise, Ghost Gaming.</p>
<p>PrizePicks – Uniquely Positioned to Be a Major Player in the South</p>
<p>In a statement, Adam Wexler, PrizePicks’ CEO, said that by headquartering in Atlanta and having in-depth knowledge of the Southern United States, the company has a competitive advantage. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the company is uniquely positioned to be a major player in the highest population density region in the US.</p>
<p>“We consider our headquarters in Atlanta and our in-depth knowledge of the Southern United States to be part of our competitive advantage.” Adam Wexler, CEO PrizePicks</p>
<p>Besides having a strong emphasis in Southern US, PrizePicks is also the only operator that currently offers DFS action on college athletes. Considering the company’s recent entry in Alabama, sports fans will be able to experience this in light of this week’s NCAA men’s basketball tournament.</p>
