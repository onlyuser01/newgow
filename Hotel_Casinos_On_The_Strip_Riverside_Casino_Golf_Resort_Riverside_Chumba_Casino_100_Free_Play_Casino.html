<p>Shazam Casino started its journey only a couple of months ago; however, it definitely has a great potential of skyrocketing as it stands out among the others.</p>
<p>Shazam Casino is operated under the Curacao legislation, providing a safe and secure environment for every player. Shazam provides online gaming material from RealTime Gaming and Visionary iGaming, two of the industry’s top-notch gaming suppliers that offer slots, table games, video poker, specialties, and live dealer games.</p>
<p>Shazam Casino has a colorful and exciting website as well as a user-friendly web design for everybody to experience the magic of the venue. But let’s start our detailed review with a quick look-through of the pros and cons of the venue.</p>
<p>Why Is Shazam Casino Worth Your Time?</p>
<p>Shazam Casino is only a new venue on the market; however, the venue has an amazing potential of becoming a favorite casino of every newbie and experienced player. We have collected the Shazam Casino’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>No-download mobile-friendly casino</p>
<p>Gaming library with 200+ games</p>

<p>Shazam Casino Welcome Package</p>
<p>Shazam Casino will warmly meet every new witch and wizard with a three-step Welcome Bonus. The offer consists of:</p>
<p>250% Slots Bonus up to $2,500 + 100 Free Spins &amp; 100% Cashback on the 1st deposit</p>
<p>275% Slots Bonus up to $2,750 + 100 Free Spins &amp; 50% Cashback on the 2nd deposit</p>
<p>300% Slots Bonus up to $3,000 + 100 Free Spins &amp; 50% Cashback on the 3rd deposit</p>
<p>This means that you’re guaranteed over $8,000 in Welcome Bonus and 300 Free Spins on Bubble Bubble 2. And that’s only your Welcome Bonus! Just imagine what will be waiting for you next…</p>
<p>Bonus Requirements</p>
<p>The first three deposits are covered by the welcome package. In addition, all new players at Shazam Casino are eligible for a no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>After playing with a Welcome Bonus, players can enjoy the Magic Adventures in the form of special holiday promos, as well as tournaments, cashback, incentives for all bitcoin deposits, and a variety of daily promos.</p>
<p>Additionally, players can also get extra spins if they sign up. Punters will earn a bonus every day for the next seven days after they make a deposit. Every day, the bonus increases in value. For “the spell” to function, players must log in every time.</p>
<p>Bonus information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The no-deposit welcome bonus comes with greater wagering requirements than the industry standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as clearly specified differently, no-deposit incentives for $40 or more have a maximum withdrawal of $100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For any reason, Shazam Casino maintains the right to terminate a customer’s account.</p>
<p>The wagering requirements are different for every bonus, so make sure to read the terms and conditions prior to depositing.</p>
<p>Shazam Casino Promotions</p>
<p>Once you enjoy your welcome package, you will like to cast spells to receive big winnings with your depositor’s offers.</p>
<p>Shazam Casino has daily promotions, aka Daily Spells, for you to try for every day of the week. This type of offer provides you with a Slots Bonus and Free Spins on a particular game.</p>
<p>The venue also boasts Magic Adventures – specific offers for different holidays and weekends or cashback bonuses. Additionally, Shazam has a Spins for Logins section. This type of bonus means that you may receive bonuses simply for logging in to the venue daily. However, if you miss a single day, you will need to start all of the adventures over.</p>
<p>Shazam Casino offers a variety of unique competitions, including the Triwizard Tournament. Compete against other members for the top spot on the scoreboard and the Goblet of Spins, as well as other enthralling rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can become a part of the hidden VIP community when you play at Shazam Casino. Before becoming a Shazam Guildmaster, advance to the positions of Potion Master, Shadow Hunter, and Moon Summoner. Comp points, big bonuses, and cashback are among the benefits you’ll receive on your VIP trip.</p>
<p>The best part is that Shazam Casino sends all of the exciting bonuses and promotions to players’ email addresses so that they don’t miss a single offer.</p>
