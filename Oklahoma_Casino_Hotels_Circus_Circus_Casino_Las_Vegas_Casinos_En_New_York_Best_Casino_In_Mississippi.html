    <h1>Oklahoma Casino Hotels Circus Circus Casino Las Vegas Casinos En New York Best Casino In Mississippi</h1>

<p>Evoplay, a leading provider of online slot games, has unveiled a new sports-themed instant game called Soccer Solo Striker. The new release sees players in the shoes of soccer team leaders as they lead their teams to victory.</p>
<p>The game allows players to pick a country that they will represent in-game. In addition to being able to pick a national team, players can also pick a difficulty level. The easy difficulty features lower multipliers but provides players with higher chances to win. On the contrary, the normal and hard difficulties increase the multipliers but are harder to beat.</p>
<p>Each time, players will go up against a new team and each time they must select one of four cards. If they pick the correct card, customers will defeat their competitors and advance to the next stage. If they fail, they will lose their bet.</p>
<p>Multipliers increase with each successfully passed stage, providing good players with chances to win huge prizes. Customers can cash out after each match and keep their accumulated prize or continue playing with the aim of reaching the top of the pyramid.</p>
<p>The luckiest players can win up to 192x their bet with the max win being €76,800 (around $84,000). The theoretical RTP of the game is 96%.</p>
<p>Soccer Solo Striker is the newest addition to Evoplay’s unprecedented Football Pack portfolio. Another game in the series is the very successful Penalty Shoot-out, which continuously attracts football fans. Operators have praised the latter title for its ability to convert sports bettors to online casino players.</p>
<p>Evoplay Is Certain the Game Will Be a Success</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay’s chief executive officer, released a statement on the launch of the new title. He said that his team is excited to present its latest instant game to the public. Kravchuk added that Evoplay believes Soccer Solo Striker will be just as successful as the other Football Pack games.</p>
<p>Giving players the choice to play as their favorite national team as well as pick their preferred difficulty level was specifically made to align with audiences who are looking for more customization and control over their gaming experience. Ivan Kravchuk, CEO, Evoplay</p>
