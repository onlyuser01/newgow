    <h1>Aliante Casino Las Vegas Best Casinos In Vegas Bettendorf Iowa Casinos Atmore Casino Harrahs Casino</h1>

<p>I can't access the transcript as they disabled my account, but this is how the situation unfolded:</p>
<p>I created my account in 2022 and their customer support agent confirmed to me that during that time there were no restrictions but apparently now they exist. They allowed me to make 3 deposits for which i took no bonuses and I played a couple hands at blackjack that i won. I wrote to their support team because i wanted to inquire about the cash back program. Since their support team was unable to help i decided I no longer want to play here so i proceeded to request a withdrawal. I was told that because i'm from a restricted territory that all my funds will be frozen, yet they had no issues allowing me make 3 deposits knowingly I use a VPN. Truth is, this is how these scam casinos operate and hide behind the terms and conditions: they welcome you and if you lose, well, no one asks any questions, but the moment you win, they enforce KYC and say you breach the terms.</p>
<p>I think it's important to emphasise the following aspects:</p>
<p>1) There were no restrictions when I created my account in 2022 and I haven't received any new terms and conditions notification since then to sign which is required by the current legislation.</p>
<p>2) Winz.io allows users to play users via restricted territories a fact that can be read on their alias domain: https://winz.com/:</p>
<p>"There are two mirrors Winz casino provides its users with: https://wins.io/ and https://winz1.io/. Both options are legit and work in most restricted areas. Also, they offer the next benefits"</p>
<p>3) The only reason i got my account locked is because i won. There's no wonder why users play at casinos such as stake.com and not at these scam sites.</p>
<p>Thomas, obviously this will not be a fair trial if you come here and say "casinos have the right to conduct account verification at any point". You strike me as a smart man that can see the harm being done here. You and I both know that if they would actually like to forbid restricted territories they could simply implement geo blocking. They're not doing that which is against the law. Even casino.guru has geo blocking because you guys are fair and only promote trustworthy casinos. You have a good reputation because you do the right thing for the player.</p>
<p>All I ask is that I receive my deposits and winnings because I was encouraged to play here by their advertising and because they allowed me to make the deposits knowingly i use a VPN.</p>
