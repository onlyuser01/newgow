On Wednesday, the company revealed that it was named one of the Best Companies for Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) for 2023 by the leading media company dedicated to Black business and economic empowerment, Black Enterprise, a statement reveals. The milestone achievement highlights the gaming and entertainment company's strong dedication to creating an inclusive workplace that stands out with diversification and at the same time grants equal opportunities for its employees.</p>
