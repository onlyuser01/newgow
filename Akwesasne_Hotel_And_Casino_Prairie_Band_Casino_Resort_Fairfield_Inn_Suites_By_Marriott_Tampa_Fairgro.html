<p>Big Time Gaming’s Max Megaways and Vegas Megaways have made their debut in Ontario via Evolution</p>
<p>Big Time Gaming, the Australian game development studio that supplies the industry with unique titles packed with innovative mechanics, is getting ready to introduce two of its top Megaways games to players in the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Max Megaways and Vegas Megaways will both make their debut with important operators in the province via Evolution. The list includes Rush Street Interactive, 888, and BetMGM. In a similar move last week, Big Time Gaming and Evolution launched Golden Catch in the US.</p>
<p>Evolution Expects the Games to Be ”Smash Hits in Ontario”</p>
<p>Evolution’s chief commercial officer for North America, Jeff Millar, commented on Big Time Gaming’s success in completely changing the way slots are played through their innovative mechanics over the years.</p>
<p>He also praised both Max Megaways and Vegas Megaways for quickly turning into “massive hits” at the time of their launch in other markets in 2022 while projecting similar success for them in Ontario thanks to their excellent bonuses and features cleverly mixed with simplicity.</p>
<p>In parallel, Nik Robinson, Big Time Gaming’s chief executive officer and founder, spoke about the positive feedback received from Ontarians since the studio started to release content in the province a few months ago. Robinson also expressed excitement regarding the two Megaways titles that “really take things up a notch in terms of engagement and playability” thanks to the super mechanics they incorporate.</p>
<p>The Megaways mechanic is a special random modifier of reels that works by changing the number of winning paylines in a new spin. In other words, players can benefit from up to 117,649 ways to win, aligned with the studio’s goal to “consistently deliver BIG WINS.”</p>
<p>In mid-June, the supplier released Big Bad Bison, a fresh slot incorporating the same mechanic.</p>
<p>What Ontarians Can Expect from Max Megaways and Vegas Megaways</p>
<p>Both games pack a series of smart and engaging mechanics. Max Megaways is described as a James Bond-inspired slot focusing on a secret agent ready to infiltrate a supervillain’s volcano island and prevent them from launching a missile launch that threatens to turn the planet into hot magma.</p>
<p>During the base game, each new spin and reaction has the potential to trigger a bonus including Wild Bombs, Maximum Megaways, Vertical Wilds, or Horizontal Wilds. The special Megascatter Enhanced Free Spins feature allows players to choose three doors into the volcano lair and uncover their Free Spin Bonuses.</p>
<p>The sequel to the original Max Megaways slot, Max Megaways 2: An Intergalactic Sequel, has already reached the Evolution Network on July 19. The general launch was announced for July 26.</p>
<p>In Vegas Megaways, players are invited to taste a juicy and glamorous slice of life on the Las Vegas Strip. They can either trigger one of the four available bonuses during the base game (Maximum Megaways, Wild Bomb, Vertical Wild, Horizontal Wild) or come across the VIP Gamble feature to grab as many as 50 Free Spins.</p>
<p>The game also lets players collect special VIP Tips that will increase their chances of making the right choices.</p>
<p>Both games feature Bonus Buy and Win Exchange features for players who cannot wait to jump in the middle of the action on the reels by purchasing bonus rounds or gambling big wins for extra spins.</p>
<p>Last week, Evolution published its interim report for the first half of the year highlighting its increased metrics across the board.</p>
