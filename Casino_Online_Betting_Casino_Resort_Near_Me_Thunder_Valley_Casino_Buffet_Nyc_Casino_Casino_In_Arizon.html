<p>Spinomenal is a fast-growing iGaming provider of content that was founded nearly a decade ago in 2014. Currently, the company offers more than 300 casino-style games that deliver thrilling and immersive experiences. As a leading iGaming provider, Spinomenal continuously expands the reach of its games, entering new markets and jurisdictions. Now, the company unveiled details regarding a new collaboration, enabling it to enter the regulated iGaming market in Portugal.</p>
<p>On Monday, Spinomenal confirmed it teamed up with Luckia, agreeing to deliver its portfolio of content for customers of the operator in the country for the first time. Judging by a statement, the launch of Spinomenal's titles will be facilitated via Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest content agreement, Luckia's customers will be able to tap into engaging and unique titles from Spinomenal. The deal sees the operator expand its offering but at the same time, complements the growth and expansion of the iGaming developer, allowing it to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Eloy Fernandez, Luckia's Head of Product, shared his excitement about the collaboration with Spinomenal. "Portugal´s market is a key operation for Luckia and we are always trying to add the best products to delight our customers," he said. Last but not least, Fernandez outlined: "We are sure that Spinomenal's portfolio will help us to continue growing in the market as did in Spain."</p>
<p>Lior Shvartz, Spinomenal's CEO, praised the new agreement with Luckia and acknowledged that the gambling sector in Portugal grew by 38.9% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2023. He added that Spinomenal is excited to debut in the country via the new agreement with Luckia. Finally, Shvartz pointed out: "We have an excellent relationship with Luckia following our Spanish expansion and expect this to be even more impactful now we’ve added Portugal."</p>
<p>As noted by Spinomenal's CEO, the company teamed up with Luckia for the Spanish market previously. There, the duo saw great results, so the new launch into the regulated online gambling market in Portugal comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>Currently, Spinomenal offers a growing portfolio of games that include fan-favorite and thrilling titles such as Demi Gods IV, Majestic King and Poseidon Rising, among others. Thanks to the latest collaboration with Luckia, such titles, as well as many others, have become available for players in Portugal. Additionally, players of the operator in the country can also tap into Spinomenal Universe with recently added games such as Book of Lucky Jack - Baba Yaga’s Tales.</p>
