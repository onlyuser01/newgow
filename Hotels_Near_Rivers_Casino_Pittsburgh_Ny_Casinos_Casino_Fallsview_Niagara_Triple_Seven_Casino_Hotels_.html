    <h1>Hotels Near Rivers Casino Pittsburgh Ny Casinos Casino Fallsview Niagara Triple Seven Casino Hotels</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I created an account with Swift Casino at the beginning of the week and deposited 300 SEK.</p>
<p>This casino claims to be a Pay and Play casino, so I expected to just start playing... but that wasn't the case. I received a message saying that I couldn't play with real money and I should contact customer service.</p>
<p>I've been trying for almost a week now, and today they replied saying that they would escalate my case. However, nothing has happened so far. I can see from my balance that the money has been credited, but I still can't play with real money. I've checked if there are any additional identification requirements, but on the document page, it says that I'm all set and no further documents are required.</p>
<p>I'm tired of waiting and I want an explanation. If they can't resolve this issue quickly, I'd like my money back. I can't withdraw it because it says I need to check the page about uploading documents... but on that page, it says I'm all set and don't need to upload anything. It's quite the Catch-22, you could say. Can you please try to clarify this for me? I'm really frustrated. Thank you in advance. //Ellen</p>
