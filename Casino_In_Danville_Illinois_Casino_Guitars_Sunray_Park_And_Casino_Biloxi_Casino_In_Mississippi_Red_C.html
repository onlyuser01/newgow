<p>Booongo Is Seizing Its Momentum</p>
<p>Booongo recently boosted its presence in Latin America by signing a partnership with Virtualsoft. Under the deal, Virtualsoft will offer a selection of the developer’s hit titles, including the high-quality Hold and Win games. The collaboration is part of the company’s initiative to expand its footprint across key markets worldwide. In February, the provider signed another one with Dotworkers, a similar platform on the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Last month Booongo inked a deal with aggregation platform provider Emara Play, which offers over 400 online casino games. The collaboration is part of Booongo’s expansion in Latin America, further boosting its LatAm presence.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, Booongo reached an agreement to roll out its slot games on the German market by signing a deal with Ously Games. It was the first partnership for the developer in Germany. Booongo inked the collaboration before the planned re-regulation of the gambling industry in the country in 2021. Under the deal, all of Booongo’s free-to-play games will be available on Spinarena, including the Hold and Win collection.</p>
