<p>Cleopatra Review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them" - From Antony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare</p>
<p>Cleopatra, the seductress of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and the Roman imagination is the ostensible theme of this slot machine. With Egyptian designs and a pseudo near east soundtrack.</p>
<p>While Classical Egypt is a fun theme, to which slot machines go back again and again, the theme is really nominal more than anything else. There is not much of a story going on as you play.</p>
<p>Small win on a low volatility Cleopatra slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are nice. The designs are bright but not garish and evoke a kind of cartoon idea of Egypt and the opulence of Cleopatra’s rule. They are also easy to read, taking some of the strain out of working out how you won during payouts.</p>
<p>There’s an electronic soundtrack that draws a little on sitars and drums to add to the atmosphere of the game.</p>
<p>Like most IGT slots the animation is functional and smooth, but nothing special. It doesn’t blow you away, but it is solid enough that it doesn’t detract from the game.</p>
<p>Cleopatra slot Gameplay</p>
<p>Gameplay is where Cleopatra rather disappoints.</p>
<p>It is a pretty standard five-reel slot with up to twenty winlines. You can select fewer if you want to up you volatility somewhat (the choice is between 1, 5, 9, 15 or 20 lines). Beyond that there is little to change up the play.</p>
<p>Video featuring 15 free spins</p>
<p>The bonus round when you hit it is a little too simple (just free spins and a multiplier).</p>
<p>If all you want from your slot is money-in, money-out then there are more streamlined games. If you want more fun from your slots, the gameplay lets you down on that score too.</p>
<p>Paytable of the basic winning combinations in Cleopatra slot</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins in Cleopatra slot</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol (the Cleopatra Logo) which will help you fill out a winline for any symbol except the scatter.</p>
<p>There is a nice rule where if you hit a payout with a Wild symbol then the payout doubles.</p>
<p>Should you hit two or more Scatter Symbols they will pay a multiple of your total bet (as opposed to the bet per line). But if you hit three or more Scatter symbols, the real payout will be on the 15 free spins you take down.</p>
<p>During the Bonus rounds there all the payouts are tripled (apart from the payout for 5 wilds). Free spins can be retriggered up to 180 total free spins, but on the whole you can expect to play your 15 and cash out.</p>

<p>Cleopatra slot Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Cleopatra is a low to medium volatility slot, so although it is a popular classic of the genre, we tend to avoid slots that are not high-volatility (for more on why see our strategy section).</p>
<p>The RTP is a little disappointing as well at 95.02% which is a little below the industries average of about 96%.</p>
<p>The site we tested allowed a range of bets from $/£/€0.20 to $/£/€200 per spin depending on how many lines and the cash value set to the coins. Which is a reasonable spread.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cleopatra is a popular slot that is not going anywhere. Many players will enjoy a few spins for old times’ sake, but on the whole she is showing her age.</p>
<p>The design is solid but uninspired and the real letdown is the oversimple gameplay.</p>
<p>When added to the poor RTP and low variance this slot looks like it should be unattractive, but must be doing something right, because people keep coming back to play Cleopatra.</p>
