<p>Tulipa Ent, a Maltese affiliate of ComeOn Group has received a license to operate in the Dutch market. As reported by iGaming Business, the brand has been cleared for launch by the Kansspelautoriteit, the Netherlands’ gaming authority.</p>
<p>Tulipa Ent Enters the Netherlands</p>
<p>Tulipa Ent is notably the twentieth operator to be licensed in the Netherlands, following the market’s re-regulation. The licensing of Tulipa Ent is in line with the Netherlands’ remote gambling act (KOA), which allows operators to offer online gambling in the country.</p>
<p>According to iGaming Business, the Kansspelautoriteit is still uncertain about the domain Tulipa Ent would choose to operate under. However, once the operator makes its decision, the domain would be listed in the Kansspelwijzer, the official Dutch gambling guide.</p>
<p>Since Tulipa Ent is a name that is barely known in the gambling space, professionals theorized that it might be a new Dutch-facing subsidiary of Come On Group. According to the Malta Company Database, Tulipa Ent Ltd. was founded in mid-March this year. The company has 1,500 issued shares and, according to the database, has two directors, namely Christiano Blanco and Juergen Reutter. For reference, Blanco is the current chief product officer of ComeOn Group, while Reutter is the company’s acting chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Blanco and Reutter’s presence in Tulipa Ent seems to reinforce the idea that the operator is a subsidiary of ComeOn Group that would target the Dutch market.</p>
<p>The Dutch Market Continues to Evolve</p>
<p>This year, the Dutch market was joined by several B2B gambling companies as well. In July, the iGaming solutions provider Delasport received certification from Gaming Laboratories International, which helped it launch its offerings in the country.</p>
<p>A month earlier, Swintt, a famous provider of slot games, made a foray into the Netherlands thanks to an agreement with Fair Play Casino. The slots specialist provided the latter company with its exquisite portfolio of engaging slot titles.</p>
<p>While the Kansspelautoriteit has been favorable to companies that earn their licenses honestly, it has been working hard to completely eliminate unlicensed gambling from the Dutch market. Since the beginning of the month, the authority has asked two black market operators to immediately cease their operations in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The first company the regulator issued a cease-and-desist order against is LCS Limited, another Maltese operator. The Kansspelautoriteit warned the company that it would be fined if it fails to comply with the order. A few days later, the authority issued another such order, this time against MKC Limited’s Betworld247.</p>
