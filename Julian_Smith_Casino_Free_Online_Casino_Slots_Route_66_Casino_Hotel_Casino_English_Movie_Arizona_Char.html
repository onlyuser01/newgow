<p>Ahead of Week 10 of the 2022 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles are the only team that has a 100% win record. They’re 8-0 so far and are planning to stay undefeated for (at least) another game week. Oddsmakers think they’re going to do it – Philly is an 11-point favorite to beat the Washington Commanders in Week 10.</p>
<p>That’s the highest point spread in a Washington Commanders vs Philadelphia Eagles game in more than a decade. Will the Eagles cover it? To see what we think, just keep on reading our preview of the Week 10 Monday Night Football game!</p>

<p>The Commanders are Desperate for Wins</p>
<p>The Commanders are 4-5 in the 2022 NFL season, which isn’t that bad, but the problem is that they’re in a very tough division. Apart from the Philadelphia Eagles, the NFC East Division is also the home to the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants.</p>
<p>As a result, the Commanders are sitting in the bottom place in the divisional standings. This, however, doesn’t mean they can’t win a Wild Card entry to the Playoffs. However, for that to happen, they will need to win a couple of big games.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, the chances are very, very slim that they’re going to win the MNF game. It’s just that the Eagles look too good for them at this point.</p>
<p>Jalen Hurts to Hurt Washington Badly</p>
<p>Philadelphia’s signal-caller Jalen Hurts is no.2 quarterback in the league with a 107.8 passer rating. He’s also great rushing-wise, which is the main reason why the Eagles offense has been so dominant.</p>
<p>And we really mean it – they’ve scored 20+ points in every single game of the 2022 season. In comparison, Washington did it only three times thus far (despite playing one game more than Philly).</p>
<p>Hurts was brilliant in the first game against the Commanders, throwing for 340 yards (his best record this season) and three TDs (his second-best score). It happened in Week 3 on Washington’s turf. In Week 10, Hurts &amp; Co. will play in front of their own crowd.</p>
<p>Washington Commanders vs Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>There’s no way anything but a big win for the Eagles is going to happen in the MNF game. They’re going to put on a fantastic show for their fans at the Linc, which should result in a blowout win with a winning margin larger than 11 points.</p>
<p>Picks: Philadelphia Eagles to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
