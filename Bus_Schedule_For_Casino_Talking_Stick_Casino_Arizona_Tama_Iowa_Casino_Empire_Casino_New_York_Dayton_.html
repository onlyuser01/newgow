<p>Hacksaw Gaming has expanded its reach in European markets with the latest partnership focusing on Italy and NetBet, a local brand with an established foothold in the market and one of the top-performing names in the online casino vertical.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Hacksaw Gaming deploy a number of its titles, including but not limited to Wanted Dead or a Wild, Hand of Anubis, Tosh Video Club, and Gladiator Legends. The supplier is also rolling out some of its more outside-of-the-box games, such as Mines, Coins, and Boxes, which test a player’s risk-taking in real-time and present some new forms of gameplay that diverge from traditional slot gaming.</p>
<p>These games are just a start as well and Hacksaw Gaming and NetBet Italy are committed to developing a more robust offering together, which will see more of the supplier’s games arrive in good time. For the moment, Hacksaw Gaming is focusing on building a slot portfolio that resonates with players across borders.</p>
<p>Company CEO Marcus Cordes noted that the partnership was another significant moment for the company, which is building up momentum nicely across various regulated markets. Italy has been a focal point of these efforts. He added:</p>
<p>"Furthermore, we’re constantly looking to team up with industry players of the highest pedigree. Netbet.IT is yet another household name that needs no introduction – an operator that shares our passion for excellence and delivering market-leading products and services."</p>
<p>Naturally, NetBet has responded in kind with NetBet Italy PR Manager Claudia Georgevici welcoming this new opportunity and its significance for the long-term collaboration between the two companies.</p>
<p>NetBet Italy has been meticulously building up its offer in the Italian market. The operator has managed to secure partnerships with a number of individual studios and aggregators over the past months, including prominent industry names such as Wazdan, CT Interactive, and 1x2 Network, as the operator still pursues dominance locally.</p>
<p>As to Hacksaw Gaming, the supplier has also not been sitting idle. The company has been able to launch across a number of regulated markets in Europe and the United States, with notable rollouts in Greece and Lithuania in Europe, and the state of West Virginia in the USA. Hacksaw Gaming also launched with BetRivers in Ontario, Canada.</p>
