<p>Golden Colts review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Golden Colts is a supernatural Western, set in a world where gothic skies overlook dilapidated Americana made up of lamplit streets stalked by undead shootists with murder on their mind and gamblers who look like they can do more than card tricks with their decks.</p>
<p>The setting is one of those that builds a world in a few quick strokes, something that Play’n GO have occasionally shown a real talent for.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>As with their world building, Play’n GO tend to pay a lot of attention to making the visuals pop in their slot machines. Golden Colts is no exception to this rule from its purple-tinted Western townscape to each of the characters who appear as symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>The soundtrack lives up to Play’n GO’s usual high standard. An atmospheric guitar which somehow evokes a Halloween mash-up of Ennio Morricone and Hank Williams.</p>
<p>All of this is tied together by tight, clear and thematically on point animations.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Golden Colts base game is a five reel, four row slot with 40 win lines. While there is no gamble feature to speak of, there are seven different bonus games which helps to keep things varied and avoids boring the player.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Hitting three Bonus symbols triggers the Bonus round. The Bonus symbol also pays out as a scatter.</p>
<p>When the Bonus game is triggered, the player spins a revolver with seven chambers. Whichever chamber comes up on top will determine which of the seven bonus games you get to play.</p>
<p>Six of these are variations on Free Spins with an additional feature triggered. These features are all combinations of large symbols, stacked symbols, locked symbols, random multipliers and respins.</p>
<p>The seventh feature is the Most Wanted Feature which is a picking game, in which you click posters. Under each poster is either an award of cash prizes, one of the other bonus games, or a symbol which will end the Most Wanted Feature.</p>
<p>This slot offers 7 different free spin bonus games</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.55%. Though only a little above the rough yardstick we use of 96%, Golden Colts’ return to player is high enough for us to give it a pass grade.</p>
<p>The site we tested offered a range of bets which extended from $/£/€0.20 per spin at the low end to $/£/€100.00 per spin at the high end.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which is lower than we like for our preferred slot machine strategies but may appeal to players with different plans for their bankroll.</p>
<p>Paytable for Golden Colts slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Golden Colts is an excellent slot from the point of view of player enjoyment. The visuals are strong, the music excellent and the atmosphere enthralling.</p>
<p>The RTP is not too bad and the gameplay is seasoned with a wide variety of bonus games.</p>
<p>In fact, the only let down is that it is a poor match for our preferred strategies thanks to its medium volatility.</p>
