<p>The supplier of fintech and payment solutions for various industries, including online gambling, has expanded with yet another partnership</p>
<p>The new collaboration sees Nuvei team up with Resorts Digital Gaming (RDG) and provide the popular gaming operator with its bank-transfer technology to simplify the payment processes at RDG-owned websites and brands.</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gets Payment Options Enhancement</p>
<p>RDG is the online gambling arm of Resorts Casino, and it operates both ResortsCasino.com and MoheganSunCasino.com. Thanks to this new collaboration, the operator will significantly strengthen its payment capacity and offer frictionless deposits and withdrawals so that consumers may benefit from one of the best possible experiences.</p>
<p>Moving forward, RDG’s brands will offer the Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer, significantly strengthening the online payment capacity for the company.</p>
<p>RDG CEO Ed Andrewes welcomed the opportunity to add this particular solution and hailed it as a convenient deposit and payout payment method that is in line with what US customers expect from leading brands such as Resorts Digital. He added:</p>
<p>Integrating Nuvei into our cashier supports our mission to provide all the relevant payment methods our players demand. RDG CEO Ed Andrewes</p>
<p>Players can now leverage the solution to deposit from their bank accounts into the Nuvei solution and online casino brands to guarantee a seamless payment journey and fast cashouts.</p>
<p>Players Get to Enjoy a Fast Payout Solution to Empower Their Gameplay</p>
<p>Nuvei CEO and chair Philip Fayer was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this partnership take shape, calling the Nuvei solution a relevant and important payment option that is now being recognized by iGaming brands in the United States. Fayer added:</p>
<p>Nuvei Instant Bank Transfer was the first payment method to bring truly instant payouts to the US iGaming market. This enhanced user experience has eliminated the need for players to wait hours or even days when they request to withdraw funds from their gaming accounts. Nuvei CEO and chair Philip Fayer</p>
<p>Fayer added that together, RDG and Nuvei will ensure that players in the Garden State have access to some of the most worthwhile payment options as they enjoy their gaming and betting experience. Nuvei’s payment gateway will also help strengthen and drive results for the company itself in terms of player retention and revenues.</p>
<p>Nuvei has been growing its global footprint, most recently expanding in the regulated market in the Netherlands and powering Holland Casino, a prominent local operator, with payment solutions.</p>
