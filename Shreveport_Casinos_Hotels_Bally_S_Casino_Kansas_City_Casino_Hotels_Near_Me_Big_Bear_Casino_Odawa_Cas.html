<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>PokerStars Casino hardly needs an introduction. The iGaming alter ego of one of the biggest poker card rooms in the world is fully available in the United States and at least in those states where online casinos are regulated.</p>
<p>As a result, players can enjoy an exclusive selection of games, promotions, and overall service that works flawlessly on desktop on mobile. The website is home to many excellent iGaming choices you can explore on your own.</p>
<p>The Stars Casino covers a lot of ground in the USA and runs operations in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey, and a growth trajectory has been established, so we can expect to see more instances of the PokerStars Online Casino before long.</p>
<p>Casino Bonus and Promotions</p>
<p>PokerStars may be new to iGaming, but it’s definitely not new to crafting excellent promos. The Stars Casino brings you a bunch of lovely promotions to explore that easily turn your iGaming experience into an enjoyable gaming session. There are lots of excellent bonuses to dive into and explore in your own leisure.</p>
<p>You are welcome to claim a $50 deposit bonus as soon as you place your first $1 bet, which is a neat addition. Just sign up for the PokerStars Online Casino and bet $1 on any game you love. The casino will automatically credit another $50 for you to explore.</p>
<p>Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>The PokerStars Casino welcome bonus is a mix of bonus money you will find easy to claim and doubly rewarding to play through. The default bonus is set at $1,500 across three individual deposits, but there is a twist.</p>
<p>As you deposit, there will be $1,000 in additional money to pick and use exclusively on slot games! Here is how it works:</p>
<p>1st Deposit : 100% match up to $500 if you deposit at least $25 and use WELCOME1 bonus code</p>
<p>: 100% match up to $500 if you deposit at least $25 and use WELCOME1 bonus code 2nd Deposit : 100% match up to $500 if you deposit at least $25 and use WELCOME2 bonus code; get a Mystery Chest that awards up to $500 in slot bonus money</p>
<p>: 100% match up to $500 if you deposit at least $25 and use WELCOME2 bonus code; get a Mystery Chest that awards up to $500 in slot bonus money 3rd Deposit: 100% match up to $500 if you deposit at least $25 and use WELCOME3 bonus code; get a Mystery Chest</p>
<p>You have 14 days to make all three deposits and claim the rewards thereof. The PokerStars Casino bonus system emulates the card room by introducing a Casino Instant Bonus.</p>
<p>To convert the Casino Instant Bonus and winnings into payable winnings, you need to earn five redemption points for every $1 you can cash out. Make sure to meet the wagering requirements before you try to withdraw your money and winnings.</p>
<p>$500 Daily Free Casino Bonus</p>
<p>PokerStars Online Casino does not shy away from a great bonus as it continues to provide players with an outstanding selection of bonus options. One of those is the daily Free Casino Bonus Chest. Bet at least $1 on any casino game at the website to receive the chest for a chance to claim up to $500 in Casino Instant Bonus.</p>
<p>Dailies, Weekday and Special Bonuses</p>
<p>Out of all the casinos we have reviewed in the United States, PokerStars seems to set the bar very high when it comes to its bonusing system. Players will be excited to have a shot at the numerous rewarding options available at the casino.</p>
<p>One such is the Tuesday Treat, a $250 prize pool that is randomly distributed between five lucky players who get $50 each. You will frequently see some random prizes that will contribute to the experience, such as the Blackjack or Baccarat Insurance promos which may be monthly or stretch through an entire season.</p>
<p>Not least, there are the daily races which run from Monday through Sunday at 18:45 ET and last in bursts of 20 minutes. You get a shot at the daily prize pool, and if you miss your chance today, there’s always tomorrow.</p>
<p>How to Set Up Your PokerStars Casino Account</p>
<p>Setting up your Stars Casino account is a simple and straightforward process. You can register from either your desktop computer or mobile device with the casino, asking for some quick verifiable details that are used for regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>The registration process is quick and simple allowing you to access the full variety of games, features, and options available at PokerStars Online Casino. As an additional requirement, you must be in a state that currently supports the casino.</p>
<p>Casino App</p>
<p>Understandably, PokerStars Online Casino has gone the extra mile in establishing a casino offer that remains available to as many people as possible. This includes the use of a dedicated PokerStars Casino app available in every regulated iGaming market in the USA.</p>
<p>The app runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded directly from the website as well as the Apple App and Google Play Stores. PokerStars has made sure to design an app that is accessible and packs the entire functionality of the website in a single mobile entry.</p>
<p>You are free to explore all real money options, including games and instant bonus money, right through the app for a quick and easy experience that does not detract from the main platform. In fact, the PokerStars Casino app makes it so much easy to enjoy a great time at the casino.</p>
<p>Games and Software</p>
<p>Now we get to the best part – the games. Similar to the bonus system, PokerStars has seemingly spared no effort in bringing you a top-notch selection of games that you will find worthwhile and enjoyable. There are all sorts of titles to try with over 160 available games, the majority of which are powered by NetEnt.</p>
<p>You will get to play many different genres, some of which are exclusively tailored for PokerStars Casino and others that are more widely available but a whole lot of fun to play all the same. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are clearly the best part about PokerStars. There are quite a few of them, and they bring you all sorts of different gaming conditions for even more fun and worthwhile experiences. The slots are many and varied. You can quickly navigate through the available offer and pick from several categories, including:</p>
<p>Popular</p>
<p>New</p>
<p>Exclusive</p>
<p>Megaways</p>
<p>The megaways mechanic is a nice touch to the PokerStars Online Casino portfolio as it gives you well over 100,000 ways to win, but it’s not just that. This being NetEnt games, for the most part, you get to enjoy hefty return-to-player (RTP) rates.</p>
<p>PokerStars users are very welcome to have a crack at some of the best titles out there that are immediate player favorites such as:</p>
<p>Starburst</p>
<p>Jumanji</p>
<p>Blood Suckers II</p>
<p>Finn and the Swirly Spin</p>
<p>Gonzo’s Quest</p>
<p>Each of these games comes with a unique feature that defines the gameplay and makes it so much more fun. Not least, you have two versions of Divine Fortune, the standard progressive jackpot one and Megaways version.</p>
<p>The progressive jackpots you can win playing slots at Stars Casino already exceed $50,000, and that is only the beginning for the casino.</p>
<p>Card &amp; Table Games</p>
<p>To enjoy the best possible experience at PokerStars, we recommend swinging by the selection of card and table games. You will find some excellent games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>Even though there aren’t too many of those, to begin with, there are still enough to keep you entertained. You get to play European and American Roulette and try Blackjack. If you are more of a video poker fan, there are numerous choices here, including:</p>
<p>Jacks or Better</p>
<p>Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Aces &amp; Eights</p>
<p>Tens &amp; Better</p>
<p>Double Bonus</p>
<p>There are naturally more. The table games section is a little underwhelming, but PokerStars has made sure that the game you have available is worth every moment you spend on them, and if you are looking for something more fulfilling, you will find it in these tested and exciting titles.</p>
<p>Live Dealer</p>
<p>To bring a spark of liveliness to your sessions, the Stars Casino has made sure to develop a great live casino offering that includes some top player choices. PokerStars brings you games such as:</p>
<p>Infinite Blackjack</p>
<p>Ultimate Texas Hold’em</p>
<p>Three Card Poker</p>
<p>Baccarat</p>
<p>Lightning Roulette</p>
<p>Each of these games is played in the company of a live dealer that successfully emulates the atmosphere at an actual casino in Atlantic City or Las Vegas and makes for a great way to stay engaged without actually having to travel to a physical casino.</p>
<p>Depositing and Withdrawing</p>
<p>Making a deposit or requesting a withdrawal from PokerStars Casino is a simple enough process that won’t take long at all. Better yet, you have an array of viable payment methods that have a high clearance rate and are trusted options.</p>
<p>Stars Casino only operates in regulated markets, and that gives the banking experience additional clout. You can use numerous payment options:</p>
<p>Payment Method Deposit Withdraw Visa Debit Yes No Mastercard Yes No PokerStars Play+ Card Yes (NJ only) Yes (NJ only) Bank Transfer Yes Yes Instant Bank Transfer Yes (PA only) No Resorts Cage Yes (NJ only) Yes (NJ only) PayPal Yes Yes Skrill Yes Yes Paysafecard Yes (MI only) No PayNearMe Yes (NJ/PA only) No VanillaDirect Yes (NJ/PA only) Yes (NJ/PA only)</p>
<p>Payment methods may vary slightly from one state to the next, but this is no reason for you to worry. PokerStars Online Casino makes the payment journey as easy and straightforward as you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you deposit from a mobile device or desktop computer, it makes no difference as PokerStars is committed to making the experience equally handy and straightforward. No payment method will charge you additional fees, allowing you to enjoy your entire bankroll.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>Sooner or later, you will run into some questions that you would want PokerStars’ customer support to weigh in on, and here is the good news – it’s very easy to get a hand of a customer care agent. You can drop an email, or, if you prefer, you can always browse through the available FAQ right away and seek an answer.</p>
<p>Stars Casino: What Do We Think?</p>
<p>PokerStars Online Casino is a fantastic place to be. Available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the iGaming platform is slowly building up its reputation.</p>
<p>While PokerStars is not investing too heavily in every jurisdiction where the Stars Casino is available, it’s still making sure to list every possible promo and make your experience far more rewarding from the very start.</p>
