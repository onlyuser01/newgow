<p>Hello HostileJesus!</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information regarding your issue, it looks like we may have find out what actually happened with your withdrawal.</p>
<p>I have asked both you and the casino to provide me with payment information and the crypto address was the same. It seems that you wanted to make a Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawal and received an address for a Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawal from Coinbase, which you have passed to casino, however you have selected Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the currency of your withdrawal. Somehow this transaction worked out and was confirmed numbers of times, which we were able to see in the payment details provided by the casino.</p>
<p>The situation as we see it is, the casino did everything according to the information they were provided with and therefore this complaint is truly unjustified. As for the Coinbase, I understand now how they "... says they have nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash" as it was described by you in your previous reply. Cases like this are very rare and I am not really able to tell you, whether you will be able to receive your funds, unfortunately. I'd recommend contacting Coinbase once again and try to describe the situation to them, maybe they will be able to find out some kind of solution.</p>
<p>As there is simply nothing we are able to do for you with this one, is there anything else that we could be of help?</p>
