<p>Mark McGinley has been handpicked to become Yggdrasil’s new Chief Gaming Officer, an important position that will seek to strengthen the company’s overall presence in the gaming market and provide it with a firm hand on the rudder as the supplier steers towards bigger successes in the iGaming vertical, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>McGinley’s appointment is a well-thought-out move, as the man has more than 25 years of relevant industry experience, having served in both the B2C and B2B verticals, and now ready to impart his knowledge and experience with Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>His expertise has allowed businesses to flourish and achieve commercial results, while also scaling their operations. McGinley is coming to Yggdrasil from another innovator in the sector, FunFair Games, where he served as the company’s CEO. However, this is hardly the only prominent position he has held in his time.</p>
<p>McGinley served as RNG Foundry’s Program Director and Entain Director of Game Studios, two outstanding and exceptional companies that hold an important role in the iGaming vertical today. He steered RNG Foundry’s global success through the Games Global Platform.</p>
<p>He also worked with Casumo and Odobo, and has amassed significant experience and commands the respect of his peers in iGaming. Commenting on his appointment, McGinley said that he was delighted to be a part of the Yggdrasil family. McGinley also said that he welcomed the chance to continue helping the company to grow its product and offering, something it has been doing successfully over the past ten years.</p>
<p>His appointment was welcomed by Yggdrasil CEO Björn Krantz who said that McGinley’s appointment will further strengthen the company’s Global Roadmap Developments and expand Yggdrasil’s strategic product differentiation.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has been big on the idea of creating products that buck established trends and stands out by virtue of their innovative mechanics, gameplay, and overall plot and themes. "I welcome Mark to Yggdrasil and to our Senior Management team, and very much look forward to working together to take our global growth ambitions to the next level," McGinley said.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil was founded in 2013 and it has developed a strong global partner network, pioneering the YG Masters program and leveraging its proprietary technology known as GATI. Yggdrasil has also continued with its march in regulated markets, recently obtaining a B2B license in Sweden.</p>
