<p>The Las Vegas-headquartered Scientific Games has surprisingly announced a rise in its year-on-year revenue and a reduction of the reported 2019 net loss, despite having a tough Q4 with falling gaming and social revenue.</p>
<p>Revenue</p>
<p>The 12 months through to 31 December 2019 reportedly generated revenue of 1.2% higher than the previous period, with $3.4 billion and $3.36 billion, respectively, and although SG did not disclose full details about the full-year revenue results but only an overarching view of the performance of the company, its services revenue numbers have gone up 2.3% compared to 2018, amounting to $1.82 billion, with product sales revenue unchanged year-on-year at $994 million but the instant product sales slightly down from $592 million in 2018 to $587 million in 2019.</p>
<p>Spending</p>
<p>Spending-wise, SG made significant cost reductions, as total operating expenses went down to $2.85 billion, 8.1% decrease, due to cutting costs across various areas of the business, with selling, general and administrative costs down 1.4% compared to the previous year, $707 million and $697 million, respectively, and cost of product sales down 1.9% to $457 million.</p>
<p>Cost of services, though, went up from $505 million to $538 million and so did instant product costs, rising to $289 million, with $284 million for the year before.</p>
<p>Another significant area of cost reduction Scientific Games noted was its depreciation, amortization and impairments costs that were 6.2% down at $647 million for the year.</p>
<p>Operating Income</p>
<p>The combination of slightly higher revenue and noticeable cost cutting resulted into a 105.1% year-on-year increase in the operating income, $546 million, with net loss before taxation going down from $339 million to $108 million. After tax, net loss was at $130 million, compared to $352 million in 2018, but the company noted that a $152 million charge related to a legal matter with Shuffle Tech was included in the 2018 report.</p>
<p>Q4 Details</p>
<p>The increase for the full year revenue number was surprising at the background of the negative end to the year, with Q4 revenue down 2.6% year-on-year to $863 million, due to gaming revenue down 5.3% to $445 million, with lottery revenue slightly up to $233 million, and digital revenue slightly increased to $72 million, unlike revenue from the SciPlay social gaming that fell 0.9% to $113 million.</p>
<p>SG operating expenses in the fourth quarter spiked 25.8% year-on-year to $711 million even though last yearâ€™s number contained a $171 million benefit due to internal restructuring, and operating income fell sharply by 52.7% to $152 million, and together with $187 million in other financial expenses, led to a net $35 million loss before income tax, $214 million for 2018 Q4.</p>
<p>The net loss standing at $43 million, after income taxes of $2 million and adding a $6 million profit from from non-controlling interests, signifies a bigger drop compared to the $207 million profit for the same period in 2018.</p>
