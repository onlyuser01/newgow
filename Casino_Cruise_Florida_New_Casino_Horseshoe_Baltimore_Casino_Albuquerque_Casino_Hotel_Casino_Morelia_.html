<p>The winner should seek financial and legal advice and should then call the Texas Lottery before going to Austin to claim the prize</p>
<p>A lucky Texan has grabbed the $360 million Mega Millions jackpot, becoming the recipient of the largest prize a Texas Lottery player has ever gotten.</p>
<p>The player, who is yet to claim their prize as of the time of this writing, is said to have purchased the ticket at a convenience store near Sam’s Club in San Angelo. The store is set to receive a $1 million bonus for having sold the winning ticket.</p>
<p>The lucky Texas Lottery player successfully matched all six numbers. For reference, the numbers were the following: 12, 24, 46, 57, 66. The Mega Ball number, which the player also matched correctly, was 22.</p>
<p>According to the Texas Lottery, the player has opted to go with the cash value option at the time of the purchase. For reference, it was $156.9 million before taxes before the drawing.</p>
<p>The jackpot won by the lucky Texan started in August. Initially sitting at just $20 million, the prize was rolled 14 times before finally being hit. This is also the 14th Mega Millions jackpot to be won by a Texan and the first since 2019 when another lucky player grabbed a $227 million prize.</p>
<p>In the meantime, thousands of players won smaller prizes ranging from $2 to $10,000.</p>
<p>The Lottery Advised the Player to Seek Financial and Legal Advice</p>
<p>The Texas Lottery congratulated the lucky player on winning the October 6 prize with the company’s executive director, Gary Grief, saying:</p>
<p>We are absolutely thrilled to have a big Mega Millions jackpot winner right here in Texas and we’re eagerly looking forward to meeting and congratulating the Lone Star State’s largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot winner. Gary Grief, executive director, Texas Lottery</p>
<p>The player now has 180 days to claim their prize. Grief encouraged them to sign the ticket and put it in a safe place. Then, according to the director, the winner should seek financial and legal advice and should then call the Texas Lottery before going to Austin to claim the prize.</p>
<p>The Mega Millions jackpot will now be reset to $20 million. In the meantime, the Powerball Jackpot soared to $1.4 billion following the latest draw.</p>
