<p>Globally recognized video bingo, video slot games, solutions and software provider, Zitro, strengthened further its footprint in the United States thanks to a new partnership. The company announced Tuesday it joined forces with the leading US supplier of casino gaming equipment and systems, KGM.</p>
<p>The new deal marks a landmark collaboration for Zitro as the company designated KGM as the exclusive distributor in strategic markets such as New York, Ohio and Connecticut. Per the terms of the new deal, Zitro will expand further its US-facing reach.</p>
<p>At the same time, the collaboration sees KGM benefit from Zitro's leading products and solutions. Thanks to the new distribution agreement, leading products from the company will reach new audiences in strategic US markets, reaffirming the potential of Zitro's content.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 14, 2023, Zitro USA's CEO, Derik Mooberry, shared his excitement saying that the company is delighted to join forces with KGM. He pointed out that KGM and Zitro share a common vision for offering innovative and quality products for their customers.</p>
<p>According to Mooberry, KGM has already established its presence in the aforementioned US states. He identified those jurisdictions as strategic markets and said that Zitro will be excited to boost the company's market presence and sales. In conclusion, Mooberry said: "We are confident this partnership will provide a great opportunity for us to bring our products to new customers and further expand our business in these key markets."</p>
<p>Jason Peters, KGM's President and CEO, shared similar excitement about the deal with Zitro. "We are excited to add the Zitro portfolio of games to KGMâ€™s catalog of products and we appreciate the opportunity presented," he said. Finally, Peters pointed out: "We believe this partnership will be very beneficial to both parties, and above all, for casino operators."</p>
<p>The US-facing deal with KGM comes on the heels of another important announcement by Zitro. Last week, the company confirmed it expanded further its European presence via a new deal with Luckia in Croatia. That collaboration marked the debut of the company in the country.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the deal with the leading provider of games of chance, Zitro agreed to deliver its successful and popular slot games. This partnership expanded further the offering of Luckia, while at the same time, helping Zitro's content reach new customers.</p>
<p>Before that, in January, the company teamed up with the leading gaming operator in Mexico, CIRSA. That collaboration saw Zitro deliver its leading Mega King games for customers of the operator.</p>
