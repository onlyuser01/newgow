<p>The Racing League has named William Hill as its official betting partner for the upcoming 2022 season. The news comes ahead of the Racing League’s start on August 4.</p>
<p>William Hill to Support the Racing League’s 2022 Edition</p>
<p>This year’s Racing League season will see teams from seven regions of Great Britain and Ireland competing across six fixtures. The event will take place in Doncaster and will have a total prize pool of over $2.4 million. The best team and the best jockey will also receive awards.</p>
<p>As the official betting partner of the Racing League, William Hill revealed that The East region, which represents East England, has 5/2 odds of winning the event. The East is followed by Ireland with 3/1 and Wales and The West with 4/1.</p>
<p>The operator also teased that London and The South’s Daniel Muscutt is the top candidate for grabbing the top jockey award. According to the betting company, Muscutt has 8/1 of receiving the prize. Dylan Browne McMonagle, Rossa Ryan, Jack Mitchell, Ben Curtis, Paul Mulrennan and Tom Marquand are not far behind with 10/1.</p>
<p>The Racing League Is Glad to Be Working with the Operator</p>
<p>Liam McKee, William Hill’s sponsorship and UK creative director of media, spoke on the matter. He praised the Racing League for its unique and original concept and said that this has always appealed to William Hill’s team. McKee added that the planned changes to the 2022 format make him even more excited to work with the Racing League once again.</p>
<p>Jeremy Wray, chief executive officer of the Racing League, shared his thoughts on the development of the Racing League:</p>
<p>We took in a huge amount of feedback following the inaugural running of Racing League in 2021, and have been keen to add several innovations into this year’s competition. Jeremy Wray, CEO, Racing League</p>
<p>He noted that this year, a total of 125 trainers will participate in the event. Wray hopes that this will create a competition that is “equally as compelling” for racing fans and bettors. Speaking of William Hill, Wray said that he is happy to have the operator by the League’s side once again.</p>
<p>William Hill is, of course, a well-known and longtime supporter of racing in this country, and we are delighted to welcome them back to Racing League. We look forward to working together in promoting both their brand, as well as our competition to racing fans and their customer base alike. Jeremy Wray, CEO, Racing League</p>
<p>888 Holdings recently acquired William Hill after several months of negotiations.</p>
