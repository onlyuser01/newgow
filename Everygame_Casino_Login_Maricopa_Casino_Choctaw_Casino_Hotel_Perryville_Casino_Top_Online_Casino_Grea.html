<p>Canadian land-based gambling group Great Canadian Entertainment announced today new changes to its managerial team with the promotion of one of its own and the appointment of a Caesars’ loyalty program expert.</p>
<p>Huge Asset in the Next Growth Chapter</p>
<p>Great Canadian Entertainment promoted its current Executive Vice President of Greater Toronto Area Operations Ron Urquhart to the role of group’s Chief Operating Officer, while Gavin Whiteley moved from Las Vegas to Toronto to assume the responsibilities of Chief Marketing Officer.</p>
<p>Matthew Anfilson, Chief Executive Officer of Great Canadian Entertainment was thrilled to announce Urquhart as the group’s COO, outlining how his career which started with him as a summer student in college has been developing to date.</p>
<p>“… since then has held senior leadership roles across multiple business units over the past two decades, helping to lead our Ontario expansions and new builds including at Pickering Casino Resort and Casino Woodbine,” Anfilson pointed out, convinced that Urguhart has developed a deep understanding of the business and “will be an enormous asset” in the company’s “next chapter of growth.”</p>
<p>Urquhart, who is set to succeed Anfilson in the role after the former COO was promoted to CEO in November, started at Great Canadian in 2001 in Nova Scotia before growing to General Manager for the Belleville site in Ontario in 2016.</p>
<p>He continued growing: first to Vice President of Operations for Ontario and later, to Executive Vice President of Operations for Greater Toronto Area. In his latest role, he was providing oversight of the company’s expansion efforts in the region.</p>
<p>“I feel privileged to take on this new role at such an exciting time for Great Canadian,” Urquhart stated in his comments, eager to commence in his new position and work closely with Anfilson to continue enhancing “the gaming and entertainment experience” for the company’s guests, as well as make “a positive impact” to Great Canadian shareholders.</p>
<p>Instrumental in Raising Gaming Standards</p>
<p>Former loyalty program expert at Caesars Entertainment Whiteley moved from Las Vegas to Toronto to assume the role of CMO and Anfilson was equally excited to welcome him to onboard, convinced that he is “a proven executive who will be instrumental” to the company’s mission of raising the gaming entertainment industry bar in Canada.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to come home to Canada to lead the marketing and entertainment initiatives with the Great Canadian leadership team to deliver value to our team members, guests, and communities from coast to coast,” Whiteley commented.</p>
<p>Montreal native Whiteley, who has a Master of Music degree from McGill University and an MBA from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has held numerous marketing and entertainment leadership roles with Caesars and Cirque du Soleil, besides overseeing Caesars’ loyalty program for over 50 destinations and online partnerships.</p>
