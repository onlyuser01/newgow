<p>WorldWatch, an online supplier, has signed a new partnership with gaming group Bull Gaming, with the companies focusing on the Italian gaming market</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of a collaboration between the two companies which will see 10 games introduced with Bull Gaming’s operations in the country, thus giving WorldWatch a further boost in Italy.</p>
<p>Italy Beckons New Opportunities to Suppliers and Operators</p>
<p>Bull Gaming CEO Francesco Gatti has welcomed the opportunity and said that it was a chance for both companies to continue growing in the market. He hailed the agreement as one the company was extremely happy with and argued that the games will be available across various platforms in the coming months, adding:</p>
<p>We will be able to offer the player a quality gaming experience and the partnership with WorldMatch will allow us to make the most of our work. Bull Gaming CEO Francesco Gatti</p>
<p>WorldWatch is further committed to providing its new partnership with the most advanced and worthwhile casino gaming content. The company chief executive, Andrea Boratto, was similarly pleased with the opportunity, teasing some of the products that the group would be able to get its hands on, including the SlotBar family.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be able to contribute to their online expansion and confident that this partnership will be mutually beneficial and will offer players the best experience possible,” Gatti confirmed. The partnership comes at a time when the Italian iGaming market enjoys a continued and sustained interest in its operations.</p>
<p>Suppliers have been flocking to the market at a rapid pace in a bid to make the most out of a lucrative online casino ecosystem that has thrived despite the hardliner position of the government against it.</p>
<p>There have been a number of prominent partnerships involving interesting local brands and foreign or local suppliers. Pragmatic Play expanded its Live Casino offer with Sportbet, a local operator. CT Interactive expanded with MondoGaming to provide 20 of its own unique games to Italian players.</p>
<p>Play’n GO also pushed into the market recently, looking to continue growing its footprint in the country and with prominent local operators. The company teamed up with SKS365, which has been recognized as one of the top employers in Italy for 2022.</p>
