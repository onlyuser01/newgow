    <h1>Isle Casino Las Atlantis Casino Four Winds Casino South Bend Oceans Casino Restaurants Chumash Casin</h1>

<p>SBC Summit Barcelona is just around the corner and the event is expected to reunite thousands of industry specialists, stakeholders, and workers who will be coming together for one of the biggest iGaming and sports betting get-togethers to meet leaders, broaden their outlook, exchange know-how and generally have a good time, SBC Events said in an email to Casino Guru.</p>
<p>Held from September 20-22 at Fira Barcelona Montjuïc, the event promises to be everything you have come to expect from it. The exhibition hall will be split into multiple zones that will allow visitors to navigate the hundreds of panels, expositions, and company presentations with ease, visiting those parts of the event that are the most worthwhile to them.</p>
<p>Commenting on the upcoming event, SBC CEO and Founder Rasmus Sojmark said that the 2022 edition of the event will be driven by a strong focus on innovation and products that help shape the future of the industry and revolutionize it.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to welcome our exhibitors, sponsors, speakers, and attendees to the majestic Barcelona for the show's second edition. The team has been working hard to ensure that this will be an unforgettable experience for all the attending delegates. And it will be," Sojmark concluded.</p>
<p>The event will feature five dedicated zones that will go over the key emphasis of the expo, including Payments &amp; Compliance, Affiliate, Market &amp; Media, Emerging Tech, Blockchain and Metaverse, Sports Betting, and Casino &amp; iGaming zones all dedicated to their own thing.</p>
<p>There will be hundreds of speakers with close to 400 people delivering insights straight from the "horse’s mouth" as it were. Some of the most prominent attendees will include Trustly CEO Johan Tjärnberg, poker legend and entrepreneur Molly Bloom, Sportradar CEO and Founder Carsten Koerl and DAZN Group CEO Shay Segev.</p>
<p>The expo will be followed by the SBC Awards, which this year will be held in front of 1,000 guests who will celebrate the industry’s most prominent achievements over the year. The event will be held right after the SBC Summit Barcelona for the sake of convenience, and it will require a separate ticket.</p>
<p>If you wish to get in and enjoy discount to the event, we welcome you to use the CASINOGURUSBCB2022VIP code which will fetch you a nice discount if you still want to make the main exhibition event and enjoy it for two days.</p>
