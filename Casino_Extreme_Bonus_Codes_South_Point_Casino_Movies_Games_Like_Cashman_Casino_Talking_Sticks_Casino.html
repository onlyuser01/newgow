    <h1>Casino Extreme Bonus Codes South Point Casino Movies Games Like Cashman Casino Talking Sticks Casino</h1>

<p>I replied back:</p>
<p>You ned further explanations? You will have them. First of all I play to the greek N1 Thiefs who were using young girls calling me ecvery week to inform me about the promotions etc(I report this because they say we do not have support via call). Let me start from the result. I lost in this casino 14k in 1 week and they banned my account forever because I am addicted as they believe(hahahha) and they did this for my own good(2xhahaha). Initially, I just played a little bit to see how the games react. It was nothing special but ok I said why not as this casino has only slots no sports bets etc. on which I am not intersted at all. So, after the first 3 times because I was loogsing money and I pushed a little bit in case I get a good return, I lost 3k. Ok I said that could be just a bad section npo worries they will return back some money on the next sections(3xhhahaha). After this loss they suspended my account just temporarily to ask for my income and the sources of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was surprised and shocked and initally I did not want to provide such personal information but I just selcted some random answers in order to allow me continune using my account. During this incident I was trying to withdraw money and when I was depositing more to continue playing they were automatically being rejected!!!! This did not happen again, meaning I was able to have peding withdrawls and to deposit more money.</p>
<p>The next sections as you realise were worst than the one tha lost the 3k...no returns, no bonuses, or if you were getting the bonus rturns x3, x10, maximum x20.</p>
<p>The same time if I had a withdrawl of just few haundreds of euros like 300 or 400 euros, the VIP team was sending me congratulations for my winnings!!!!!!!!!!! LOL the same time that I was loosing 17k!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Finally because I overeacted when I was loosing this ammount and I sent them some nice words and I said that this experince has caused me only disatisfaction and there is no entertainment to this disgusting appauling experience they blocked my account forever and they kept insulting me that I am addicted!!!!!!!(4xhahahah)</p>
<p>In conclusion, another poor-scam casino that wants to steal money from the players and then accuse them that they are the bad guys. Furthermore, in Greece we have tax over 100 euro profit per section..!!!!!!!!!!! What does this mean? You play 1000 euro you loose. You play next time you win 1000 and they keep 180 tax!!!! Total:820 euros!!!!! + the percentage that the casino keeps : PLAYERS WILL ALWASY LOOSE THEIR MONEY - NOONE WINS !ONLY THE FUCKING THIEFS.</p>
<p>Laslty, I want to mention that I have playes to all Greek casinos and few international. Greek casinons are the biggest scam. Highest multiplier that I ever saw is 1500 and of course after I was loosing money. This applies also for all my friends and vides on the web. I have wager MILLIONS!!!!!! to all the onliune casino always only on slots and I never saw a max win even in game with 2000x 3000x. They only give max wins to peple that are playing 0.20 euros and of course becvause they have lost his money.</p>
<p>Therefore in my opinion playngo + greek casinos(especially the N1 thiefs) + in general slots is one of the biggest scams ever and the only time that you can see games giving a big win is only if you play with fake money or if y ou are a youtuber who streams slots so they can be advertised and to scam the people that they could win too.</p>
