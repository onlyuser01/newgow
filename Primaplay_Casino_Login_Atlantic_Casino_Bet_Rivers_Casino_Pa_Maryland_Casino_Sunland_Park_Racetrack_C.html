<p>Kambi Group, a leading provider of sports betting services, has set its sights on long-term growth by adopting new financial targets that align with the company's strategic vision</p>
<p>These targets, which were presented at the company’s Capital Markets Day on January 19, include revenue of 2-3 times the levels of 2022 by 2027 and an EBIT of over EUR 150 million ($162 million).</p>
<p>Ambitious Targets Backed by Key Factors</p>
<p>The company’s Board of Directors has based these targets on a number of key assumptions, including the regulation of sports betting in select markets, the retention and acquisition of partners, and the successful implementation of the company’s product strategy. Furthermore, Kambi estimates that its global addressable market could reach EUR 50 billion ($54 billion) gross gaming revenue (GGR) by 2027.</p>
<p>To support these ambitious targets, the company’s Board of Directors also plans to align future equity programs with performance criteria that correspond to these financial targets. This will ensure that the company’s shareholders can benefit from the company’s growth and success in the long term.</p>
<p>The company’s Capital Markets Day was an opportunity for investors, analysts, and other industry stakeholders to learn more about Kambi’s strategic vision and long-term growth plans. The event also provided attendees with an opportunity to ask questions and engage in discussions with the company’s management team and Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The company is confident that its long-term financial targets, coupled with its innovative product strategy, will enable it to capitalize on the growing global sports betting market and generate sustainable growth for its shareholders in the years to come.</p>
<p>Kambi Introduces more Flexible Platform</p>
<p>The Capital Markets Day also provided an in-depth look into how Kambi’s strategy will lead to a more flexible platform that allows partners more control over their sportsbooks. The company’s new platform will enable partners to customize and optimize their sportsbooks to better meet the needs of their customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform will include high-quality standalone services that can be integrated with other sportsbooks, which will enable partners to create a comprehensive and seamless betting experience for their customers.</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, Kambi CEO and co-founder, commented on the planned new developments:</p>
<p>Kambi is a market-leading B2B sportsbook with a product that few operators can match. As we aim to push product boundaries even further and deliver high-quality modular services, we are in a strong position to evolve our business model and capitalize on the growing revenue opportunity of an expanding global sports betting market. Kristian Nylén, Kambi CEO and co-founder</p>
<p>Kambi’s third-generation trading technology will also play a critical role in achieving these targets. The company’s cutting-edge trading technology will enable greater efficiencies and product quality, which will ultimately drive more revenue and profitability.</p>
<p>During Capital Markets Day it was also discussed how the evolved Kambi sportsbook will be relevant to all market segments, including traditional sports betting markets as well as emerging markets such as esports.</p>
