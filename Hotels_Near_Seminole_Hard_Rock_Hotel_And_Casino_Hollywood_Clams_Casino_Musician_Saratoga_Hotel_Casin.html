<p>The NFL and DraftKings are expanding their DFS content partnership beyond the United States and launching in Canada to bring better fan experiences.</p>
<p>DraftKings Gains Access to Canadian DFS Market with NFL</p>
<p>DraftKings is launching its daily fantasy sports (DFS) product in Canada, as the company is looking to add more National Football League (NFL) opportunities up north. The company has reached an agreement with the NFL to expand existing content partnership to Canada.</p>
<p>This comes ahead of a new single-event sports betting bill which could allow wagering on individual game outcomes to become legal in the country before long.</p>
<p>The partnership has been struck ahead Sunday’s game and marks an important milestone for both the NFL and DraftKings whose partnership was previously limited to the United States.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, DraftKings CBO Ezra Kucharz shared his excitement to be expanding the reach of the current partnership.</p>
<p>Kucharz explained that the existing relationship was important as it led to higher customer engagement and better overall experience. Yet, the expanded agreement allows DraftKings the opportunity to access the Canadian market and bring even more polished experiences for domestic fan bases.</p>
<p>A Natural Continuation of the Partnership</p>
<p>The NFL and DraftKings have been working together since 2019 in the DFS vertical and beyond, collaborating on various activations, content opportunities and offerings available throughout NFL Media properties and DraftKings app.</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership, NFL Canada Director of Corporate Partnerships Gavin Kemp expressed confidence that the partnership would strengthen the fan’s experience in the country.</p>
<p>“The popularity of Daily Fantasy in Canada continues to rise, providing a great point of connectivity for our fans to engage with the NFL,” Kemp concluded.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is expected to see as many as 23.2 million Americans bet legally this year, with one-third of all wagers placed from legal sportsbooks. The total gambling handle is expected to reach $4.3 million this year, and some 7.6 million people choosing to place their wagers remotely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DraftKings has been driving a strong global push with the company launching on the Swedish market and DraftKings’ stock has shown signs of renewed strength in February.</p>
