    <h1>Casinos Minnesota Casino Video Hotels Near Agua Caliente Casino Bay 101 Casino San Jose California C</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela,</p>
<p>When I withdrew the funds the casino emailed me numerous times asking for documents to verify my ID, address and debit card used to deposit funds. My ID and address were fine, my issue was with the debit card.</p>
<p>They asked me to send them a photo of the card used to deposit the funds. I no longer have this card, it broke a few weeks back but I do have photo's of it on my phone. I sent them one of it but they then replied saying I need to send a signed copy, which I then did (had photo's of both). They then asked if I could send a photo of me holding the card next to my face - as explained I no longer have this card (waiting on a replacement) so I explained this to them and asked if there was anything else I could provide. I received a response saying instead they can accept a bank statement showing the original deposit which I sent them straight away.</p>
<p>A few days later I received an email to say my winnings have been confiscated and my account closed permanently as I breached their 2.1.9 T&amp;C's by forging my debit card details. I asked them to explain more to which they replied saying they believe I forged my card to include a signature when I uploaded the second photo.</p>
<p>The T&amp;C's they are referring to are:</p>
<p>2.1.9. Due to the laws and regulations concerning anti-money laundering and gambling and also its licence conditions, the Company is required to make checks to verify your identity and the source of funds deposited by you. The Company may at any time request you to not only verify your identity and address but also request proof of ownership for any payment method used to deposit or withdraw funds. The check may also include a verification of source of wealth and/or source of funds. If sufficient verification documentation is not provided, we have the right to confiscate/void possible winnings.</p>
<p>As per the T&amp;C's, I have successfully provided them with every document included. Although they think the signed photo of my debit card was forged, I ultimately provided them with a bank statement showing the initial deposit so as per the T&amp;C's they have proof of ownership for the original payment method used to deposit funds.</p>
<p>I have emailed them numerous times explaining that although they aren't happy to accept my debit card photo, the second document they requested (a copy of my bank statement) was accepted so I have complied with everything they have asked. for.</p>
<p>They told me their decision is final and if I'm still not happy then I need to lodge a complaint with them. I lodged the complaint and received the exact same reply as the first email that their decision is final.</p>
<p>Any help would greatly be appreciated!</p>
