    <h1>Casino Royale Yacht Actors Casino Royale Pokerstars Casino Promo Code Pittsburgh Rivers Casino Illin</h1>

<p>The leading global gaming and entertainment company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced it secured an important certification. Last week, the company revealed that it once again secured responsible gambling certification from the Global Gambling Guidance Group (G4), recognizing its PlayDigital and Global Gaming operations.</p>
<p>The latest recognition marks a milestone moment for the company and it comes after its gaming operations secured such certification in 2017. Moreover, IGT's digital solutions secured G4 responsible gaming accreditation back in 2019, while its sports betting business was recognized in 2022.</p>
<p>The G4 certification recognizes the efforts of companies within the gambling industry that seek to decrease the impact of problem gambling. To secure the latest certification, IGT has undergone an independent assessment that identified its commitment toward responsible gambling through industry-leading practices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the accreditation confirms that the company was able to maintain the highest standard for player protection tools, as well as responsible gaming information. Areas where IGT has undergone assessment by G4 include corporate standards, responsible gambling code of conduct, player protection tools, operational code of practice, staff and problem gambling, staff and responsible gambling as well as player protection framework.</p>
<p>Pieter Remmers, the Chairman of the G4 Board of Directors, shared his excitement in a statement. "IGT has showcased its responsible gaming commitment and industry leadership year after year, and G4 is pleased to recognize the company's Global Gaming and PlayDigital operations with accreditation again," he explained. Finally, Remmers pointed out: "We applaud IGT's critical responsible gaming efforts and appreciate all that the Company does to maintain the integrity of gaming globally."</p>
<p>Wendy Montgomery, IGT's SVP, Marketing, Communications and Sustainability, added that responsible gambling is one of the company's core business principles. She outlined that securing this accreditation for its Global Gaming and PlayDigital products reaffirms IGT's commitment to its Sustainable Play initiatives.</p>
<p>"IGT was the first industry supplier to earn G4 accreditation for gaming and digital responsible gaming excellence, and the first in the US to be accredited for sports betting," added Montgomery. Finally, she said: "IGT will continue upholding itself and our partners to the highest responsible gaming standards as we promote positive play for all."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, IGT announced a new partnership with the gambling operator in Puerto Rico, Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, the company agreed to supercharge the operator's mobile and retail sports betting offering with its award-winning technology, IGT PlaySports.</p>
