    <h1>Online Casino With Real Money Fantasy Springs Casino Hotel Casino In Cancun Embassy Suites San Juan</h1>

<p>Hello, Sunday 26.7. I won over 15000 euros on the money train game. After requesting the withdrawal of 10,000 euros, I received an email stating that the winnings from the bonus money I received as a reward for moving across the galaxy must not exceed 1000 euros and that the balance of 16000 euros that I had in my casoo account left me only 1000 euros. The game room took the rest from me. I attach communication from the casino.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to our Terms and Conditions we can only payout 1000 EUR of your winnings.</p>
<p>9.10 The maximum amount of money that can be won from a no deposit bonus (eg. Glimmer rewards, cash-back, bonus money, complimentary free spins and other free awards) accounts to € 1,000 and other currency equivalents. Any winnings resulting from such bonuses exceeding € 1,000 will be kept by the management.</p>
<p>You have activated a lot of level up bonuses and your balance is based on them.</p>
<p>At 24.07.2020 17:35:41 UTC you activated bonus -&gt; Valetina bonus money (25 EUR) (screenshot attached)</p>
<p>At around 20:02 UTC time you only had 0.46 EUR on your balance while you where still wagering Valentina bonus money. (screen shot attached)</p>
<p>If not for our bonus money, you would have lost your balance.</p>
<p>Taking this fact into account, we have no other choice but to follow our Terms and Conditions that are applied equally to every player.</p>
<p>Decision of management is final.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>It seems to me like an unfair practice that everyone has to watch out for !!! They won't let you have the money you win or you can spin it. They'll just take them from you.</p>
