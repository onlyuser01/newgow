<p>If someone told you before the start of the 2022 NFL season that the Dallas Cowboys would be 4.5-point favorites against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau, you probably wouldn’t believe them. But that is the case ahead of Week 10.</p>
<p>The main reason behind this is that the Packers are playing horrible football lately. They’re 0-5 in the previous five games. The worst thing is that in four of those, they were odds-on favorites.</p>
<p>The Cowboys, on the other hand, are fantastic in 2022. With a 6-2 record, they’re second in the NFC East, but they also sit in a playoff spot when conference standings are concerned.</p>

<p>Dallas Cowboys’ First Game in November</p>
<p>The rest is over for the Cowboys who had a bye in Week 9. What this means is that they’ve had plenty of time to prepare for the game with the Packers in Week 10. Winning this game is important for many reasons for the Dallas team.</p>
<p>First of all, this is one of the toughest games they got to play in the remainder of the regular season. Secondly, the Packers are one of their biggest rivals and the only NFC that has a positive record against the Cowboys. The Packers lead the all-time series 20-17, with a couple of playoff wins that still hurt the Cowboys fans.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers Have a 16% Chance to Make the Playoffs</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, the chance that the Green Bay Packers will advance to the 2022 NFL Playoffs has dropped from 27% to 16%. This happened after their shocking loss to the Detroit Lions last weekend.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, most online sportsbooks are giving +550 on the Packers making the Playoffs. This, however, doesn’t necessarily mean the bookies are right. This team still has plenty of talent on the roster, meaning that we probably haven’t seen the best of them.</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers remains one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, despite his poor stats in 2022. The Packers also have a great defense, which needs to do even better in the next few weeks. We’re sure Green Bay players will improve their game in near future, but that might not happen in Week 10. It’s just that Dallas looks too strong for them at the moment.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs Green Bay Packers Predictions</p>
<p>The Packers are terrible, but they need to up their game ASAP. Unfortunately, they’re taking on in-form Cowboys on Sunday, which is the team that had a bye in the previous game week. All considered the Cowboys look capable of ripping the Packers apart in Week 10.</p>
<p>Picks: Dallas Cowboys to win but not cover the spread; under to hit</p>
