<p>MansionBet, the sports betting brand of Gibraltar-headquartered gaming company Mansion, announced its partnership with Sky Sports Racing was expanded to include sponsorship for all US coverage.</p>
<p>Enhance Brand Awareness among Fans of US Horse Racing</p>
<p>MansionBet will now sponsor race day reviews and previews of all stateside racing events broadcast by Sky Sports Racing and will further expand its global reach as the legalization of sports betting in the US gathers speed with more and more jurisdictions looking to make wagering on sports legal.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be partnering with MansionBet, who have shown a clear commitment to horse racing, at a time when Sky Sports Racing continues to reach significant monthly numbers.” Glen Swinney, Commercial and International Manager, Sky Sports Racing</p>
<p>MansionBet already secured significant presence in British horse racing after an agreement with the Jockey Club Racecourses (JRC) and Arena Racing Company (ARC) for the renewal of their sponsorship deal was reached in January 2021.</p>
<p>“Having invested in horse racing sponsorships over the last couple of years, we have increased our brand awareness among racing enthusiasts.” Dana Bocker, Head of Integrated Marketing, MansionBet</p>
<p>Significant Presence in Horse Racing</p>
<p>In addition, the sports betting brand has a deal with Newbury racecourse in place since December 2020, to allow it to feature across several other races this year, among which the MansionBet Challow Hurdle scheduled to take place in December.</p>
<p>“With some fantastic action around the corner including the Boodles Chester May Festival, Royal Ascot and top quality international action such as the French Classics and the Triple Crown from the US, it is a great time to welcome MansionBet to the channel.” Glen Swinney, Commercial and International Manager, Sky Sports Racing</p>
<p>Besides extending existing sponsorship deals, MansionBet made sure to increase its brand awareness among fans of horse racing by renewing its arrangements with champion jump jockey Brian Hughes and the winner of Triple Group One races Hayley Turner OBE.</p>
<p>“The sponsorship of Sky Sports Racing is a natural progression and puts us in front of over 2m targeted regular viewers with a keen passion for racing. We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership can take us to the next level.” Dana Bocker, Head of Integrated Marketing, MansionBet</p>
<p>MansionBet’s partnership with the ARC was expanded beyond horse racing in February, after the sports betting brand agreed to become a sponsor of 800 greyhound races across tracks in Perry Barr, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sunderland.</p>
