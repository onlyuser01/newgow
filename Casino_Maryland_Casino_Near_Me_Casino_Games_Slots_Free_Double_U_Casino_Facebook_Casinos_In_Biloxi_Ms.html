<p>Kattar With a Chance to Take His UFC Career to the Next Level</p>
<p>It was the summer of 2017 when Kattar made his debut in the UFC. It was a successful one – he defeated Andre Fili by unanimous decision. From there, he went on to win another six UFC fights while losing three.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that all of his defeats in the promotion happened by decision. Actually, he is still without a single loss by KO/TKO in his professional career, losing just one fight by submission. The loss happened a long time ago – in 2008 when he was a 20-year-old.</p>
<p>In 2022, Kattar is 34 and he seems to be in the shape of his life. In his previous fight, he beat Giga Chikadze by unanimous decision, even though he was a +200 underdog before the fight. Their bout was declared the Fight of the Night, which was the fourth time Kattar’s fight got this accolade.</p>
<p>Emmett Looking for His Fifth Straight Win</p>
<p>So far, he’s fought 10 UFC fights, winning eight of those. Four of those wins happed in Emmett’s previous four fights.</p>
<p>His impressive run started with a KO win over Michael Johnson, followed by a TKO win over favored Mirsad Bektic, which was probably the best performance of Emmett’s career. Then, in the following two fights, he beat Shane Burgos and Dan Ige, both by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>As a result, Emmett got himself into the spotlight of UFC fans. Nevertheless, he’s still considered an underdog by the bookies. Still, if he manages to upset the odds this coming Saturday, you can be sure his career will get a major boost.</p>
<p>Calvin Kattar vs Josh Emmett Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a real thriller, with both fighters giving their utmost. You can be sure that neither Katter nor Emmett will back down regardless of how intense the fight gets. That said, it’s very likely the fight will go the distance, but who will win? Even though we think Emmett mustn’t be underestimated, Kattar is seen as the favorite for a reason.</p>
<p>Picks: Calvin Kattar to win by decision</p>
