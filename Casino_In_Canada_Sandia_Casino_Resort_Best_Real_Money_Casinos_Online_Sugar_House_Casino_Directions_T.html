    <h1>Casino In Canada Sandia Casino Resort Best Real Money Casinos Online Sugar House Casino Directions T</h1>

<p>yes im a previous depositor and the free chip they gave me as well as free spins was what i think they meant by multiple free chips. it was one free chip, and one free spins. i did not win on free chip but i won 40on free spins. thats after i made the playthrough requirements. that was over a week ago it was on my withdrawable balance. however i did not choose to withdraw it. a couple of days ago i logged in through inclave as i always do and played a bit more and won big for 2600 and when i looked at how much i could withdraw it told me i needed to deposit 10 dollars to withdraw which im a depositor and had a withdrawable balance but i said ok and deposited 16. i felt lucky and started playing and won up to almost 3k and decided to cash out then. i was approved with no requirements for 2k. of course when i went back to playing with the remainder 895 or something like that i lost grievously as i expected i would. an hour went by and no payouty so i opened a chat and inquired as to how long and after they checked into it for about 5 minutes they came back and said three to seven days. they gave no other terms or requrements and everything was ok. yesterday morning i looked at it and the 16 dollars was payed out to my specified btc address but the rest was taken by a manager with false claims of multipke accounts which i pointed out that that wasnt possible since im using inclave then the reason changed to multiple free chip which wasnt true at all because there was only one free chip used initally and didnt win. the following free spins won over a week ago and i cleard the playthrough. a week later i started with 40 withdrawable balance and won 2600 and as prompted made over the nessicary deposit it requested in order to cash out. played after the deposit winning 400 more and was approved for 2000 withdraw and had timeframe verified to recieve but only got 16 dollars. so i did not cheat or manipulate anything, this is just another cheapskate casino and id like my btc please , thank you</p>
