    <h1>Reno Nevada Hotels And Casinos Biloxi Mississippi Casino Casino Del Sol Buffet Casino Yuma Az Raging</h1>

<p>The supplier of digital content is bullish on expanding its presence in the Balkans</p>
<p>EGT Digital, a Sofia-headquartered next-gen online casino tech company, announced that it has expanded its footprint on the Balkans by launching content in the Republic of Serbia. The company’s online games are now available to customers of markurxtip.rs, a local gambling site.</p>
<p>The agreement with MerkurXtip marks EGT Digital’s foray into Serbia and allows Serbian gamblers to enjoy its supreme content for the very first time.</p>
<p>Some of the supplier’s games that local players already got to try out include hit titles from EGT Digital’s Bell Link, High Cash and Single Progressive Jackpot series. The launch was lauded as a resounding success with EGT Digital’s games quickly proving to be a hit among Serbian casino aficionados.</p>
<p>The foray into Serbia comes several months after a home deal that saw EGT Digital power the Bulgarian online casino powerhouse Winbet with a number of classics such as 5 Burning Clover, 40 Super Hot, Royal Secrets and 10 Shining Diamonds, among others.</p>
<p>The Games Are a Hit with Serbians</p>
<p>Representatives of the two companies expressed their excitement about the partnership. MerkurXtip’s head of online business, Nenad Aleksić, said that the integration was a success and that EGT Digital’s titles “were very well accepted” by its players. In fact, EGT Digital’s players are currently some of the most favored options in MerkurXtip’s iGaming library, the head of online business pointed out.</p>
<p>Because of that, Aleksić said that he cannot wait for his company to integrate more games from the supplier into its roster.</p>
<p>Anticipating similar positive results, I foresee the upcoming integration of the remaining games from the provider’s portfolio, which we plan to do shortly. Nenad Aleksić, head of online business, MerkurXtip</p>
<p>Tsvetomira Drumeva, EGT Digital’s head of sales, echoed Aleksić’s positive sentiments about the agreement. She said that the deal is very important to her team and labeled it as “another milestone” for EGT Digital.</p>
<p>Drumeva is optimistic that her team will be able to leverage its momentum to expand its presence in the Balkan iGaming market.</p>
<p>I believe that this is just the beginning of a steady streak of success for our company in the region as a whole. Tsvetomira Drumeva, head of sales, EGT Digital</p>
<p>Earlier this month, EGT Digital also debuted content in Armenia, launching games from the Bell Link, High Cash, and Single Progressive Jackpot series with Goodwin. This follows an earlier launch with CrystalBet in Georgia and highlights EGT Digital’s ambition to grow its business.</p>
