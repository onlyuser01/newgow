    <h1>888 Casino Review 888 Casino Bonus Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre St Louis Potawatomi Casino Carter M</h1>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I can confirm that a deposit was made for 50€ and a bonus was claimed for 25€ in our daily re-load promotion. I would like to provide a link to the Bonus Terms and Conditions which you are bound to upon receiving this bonus:</p>
<p>https://www.bcasino.com/en/promotions/daily-reload#tnc</p>
<p>As you can see, the terms include the following ‘’non-allowed’’ activity:</p>
<p>The following wagering activities are not allowed until the wagering requirements of this bonus have been completed:</p>
<p>· ….</p>
<p>· Betting more than € 4 per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game</p>
<p>· ….</p>
<p>If, on review of your wagering activities, it is found that you have performed one of the above, your winnings will be removed.</p>
<p>When the game play was reviewed, it was apparent that a number of bets were made for 3€, which exceeded 10% of the bonus given and is not allowed whilst still within wagering requirements.</p>
<p>As you have mentioned, I can confirm that the Terms and Conditions were updated slightly on the 27th May. The change that was made, relevant to this case, was the above line (Betting more than € 4 per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game) to which it previously stated :</p>
<p>Betting more than € 5 per spin or 10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two) on a slot game</p>
<p>As you can see, the maximum bet had been lowered slightly, however, our terms and conditions were clear and unchanged regarding the '10% of the received bonus amount (the smaller of the two)' , in this case, 10% of the bonus received being 2.50€ (bets were placed for 3€). Casino Guru have been provided with screen shots of the previous version of the terms and conditions, which shows that this clause was there before.</p>
<p>I do hope that this answers your questions, please let me know if you require any further information regarding this and I will be happy to help.</p>
