    <h1>Mohegan Sun Casino Uncasville Tulalip Casino Jobs Seneca Niagara Resort Casino Casinos With Hotels N</h1>

<p>Having an assuredly difficult time withdrawing my 400 in winnings.</p>
<p>Casino states a 24hr Max withdraw time and even shorter time with front of the line privileges for vip members (which I am) first of my withdraw is on pending for 48hrs and then cancelled with the email stating to ask support for the reason. I ask support and they say they are having bank operation error or maintenance or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Put through another withdraw attempt. This time sitting on pending for 3 days. With excuses saying they are busy and will get too it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Then stating they are having more bank withdraw dramas and I suggest changing withdraw method. They state that may be an option.</p>
<p>I cancel withdraw and try litecoin withdraw. And it was cancelled in under 20mins. Funny how they have the time to get to that so quick. Iv run out of patience and cannot tolerate the generic reply anymore and am hoping you will be able to help my case.</p>
<p>Also just to clarify I am fully verified b4 starting these withdraw attempts</p>
