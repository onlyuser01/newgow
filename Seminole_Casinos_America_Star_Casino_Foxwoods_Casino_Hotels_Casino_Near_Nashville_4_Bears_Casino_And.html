<p>The Bounty Builder Format</p>
<p>PokerStars’ Bounty Builder format allows players to win money, without the need to spend hours playing, or trying to reach “the bubble“. Instead, each player has a bounty on them. When a player knocks out another player, they win the bounty for that player.</p>
<p>In that line of thoughts, one player may win their buy-in with a good hand or even double their prize money following a KO streak. Although there are no guarantees, Bounty Builder events make the games unique. Furthermore, the “Turbo element” boosts the speed for each game.</p>
<p>Plenty of Events Are Available For Low-Stake or High-Stake Players</p>
<p>Bounty Builder Turbo Series offers different versions to make it easier for players to match their type of play. The low-stake $5.50 buy-in level features a total of six events, which gives the players a chance of winning a combined prize pool of more than $200,000. Furthermore, participants can also win from knocking out other players.</p>
<p>Additionally, players that may prefer higher level buy-ins can join 18 events at $11 buy-in. Furthermore, there will be 37 more events at the higher $22 buy-in. Looking at the 12 opening events alone, players have the chance to win more than $3.5 million in prize money.</p>
