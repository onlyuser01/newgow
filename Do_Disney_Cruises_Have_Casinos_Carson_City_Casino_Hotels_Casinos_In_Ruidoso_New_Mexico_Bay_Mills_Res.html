<p>The National Securities Exchange Commission of Spain announced it would grant a request from Group Codere SA to suspend its stock from trading as the company begins to dissolve its assets.</p>
<p>Taken Down from Public Trading</p>
<p>Spain’s securities trading regulator Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), acting on an official request from Group Codere, announced its stock would cease to trade on the Madrid Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>“Shareholders had approved the proposed resolution to dissolve the company and the opening of winding-up proceedings. Furthermore, it was agreed to request the CNMV the suspension and removal from trading of their securities.” Spokesperson, CNMV</p>
<p>Codere requested the trade suspension following a shareholder decision that approved the dissolution of the company’s assets. Last month, a restructuring plan that was approved earlier in the year and provided for the company’s bondholders to gain a 95% stake after transferring the business to a new entity, Codere New Topco SA, was completed.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan which saw €367 million of debt being capitalized into equity and a shift of power was due to the company’s financial struggles that were exacerbated by the global response to the pandemic, forcing the business in a corner.</p>
<p>As the deal transferred almost the entire control into the hands of Codere’s US bondholders, it was only a matter of time before they decide to break down the company and start selling the pieces. Following the decision taken at a shareholder meeting, the CNMV said the exchange authorities would suspend trading of Codere stock effective Friday, December 17, 2021.</p>
<p>Online Gaming Safe from Dissolving</p>
<p>Codere’s online division will continue to operate after it showed its resilience during times in which the group’s land-based facilities were struggling. Operating across markets in Spain, Italy and Latin America Codere Online proved its value and, following an increase in turnover since the re-opening of Latin American jurisdictions where it is operational, for now, the division looks safe from dissolving.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Codere Online went public on the NASDAQ earlier this month after closing a merger with DD3 Acquisition Corp. to become the first Latin American publicly traded iGaming company.</p>
