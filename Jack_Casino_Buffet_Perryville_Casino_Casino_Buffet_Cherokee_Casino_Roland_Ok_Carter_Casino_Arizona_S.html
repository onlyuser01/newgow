<p>America’s got bettors, but their numbers seem to be independent of regulatory changes or the availability of more gambling options across the United States. A new poll by Arizona State University’s Global Sports University has found out that, for the most part, people in the US are still divided when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>The numbers of those for and against seem to be fixed. This comes at a time when 30 states and Washington D.C. have introduced sports betting regulations and 196 million Americans now have access to betting products.</p>
<p>Arizona Pinpoints the American Sports Bettor</p>
<p>Based on the poll’s findings, 44% of respondents feel that having the ability to place wagers in sports contests is a good idea. Some 16% are still opposed. The poll was conducted between January 13-19 and it offered many interesting insights.</p>
<p>For example, 62% of respondents admitted that they were not participating in any type of sports betting contest, despite the increase in available options. Another 79% confirmed that the fact that you had more retail venues to walk in and place a wager had not changed how they felt about sports.</p>
<p>In terms of public perception, 54% of males were in favor of betting. They were mostly in the age groups of 35-54 (54%), and Hispanic/Latinos and Atlantic region respondents were more likely to be in favor of sports betting (49%). Meanwhile, demographics that were opposed were males aged 65+ (31%), postgraduates (21%), and conservatives (21%).</p>
<p>This, Global Sports Institute director of research Scott Brooks thinks is indicative that people’s opinions of sports betting legalization and participation come down to different motivations. A wave of legalization has not changed most people’s opinions of sports gambling. Commenting for Sportico, Brooks added:</p>
<p>“People are pretty stuck with their ideas of betting, whether that’s a good thing or not, particularly if they’re willing to bet.”</p>
<p>Advertisements and Who the Most Frequent Bettors Are</p>
<p>The survey looked into personal beliefs and opinions about sports gambling and how the legalization has impacted participants. Some 43% of the respondents said that they had not seen advertisements on television or other platforms about specific sports betting platforms. Another 44% confirmed that they had and 13% responded that they weren’t sure.</p>
<p>The survey then dug into what demographics had been the most likely to be targeted by sports betting advertisements since 2018. It was established that males between 35-44 and in the Western region were the most likely targets of such advertisement, around 51% for both indicators.</p>
<p>Breaking down the demographics further, it turned out that females were less likely to have seen betting advertisements (51%) along with people in the Pacific region (56%), and Asian groups (53%).</p>
<p>The poll further looked into betting behavior and frequency of participation. For example, the category listed as “frequent bettors” would be betting monthly (15%). Another 23% would be betting less than a month. Frequent bettors were mostly between the ages of 18-44 (70%), earning over $100,000+ a year (35%) and male (68%).</p>
<p>Casual bettors were mostly in the ages of 35-54 (39%) with the bulk of them earning $50,000+ annually (65%) and male (55%). As to those opposing betting altogether, they were female (58%) and those aged 65+ (28%) were the most opposed.</p>
