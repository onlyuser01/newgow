<p>Playtech and 888 Team up for RNG and Live Games in the US</p>
<p>Playtech and 888 Holdings are deepening their content ties in the United States with the former announcing that it will be providing 888casino with its dedicated iGaming portfolio. 888 Holdings is an established player in the North American and European markets and maintains a healthy global reach.</p>
<p>New Live and RNG Games Coming to 888casino NJ</p>
<p>The new partnership will cover multiple states, testifying to both companies’ determination to maintain their momentum in the United States. Playtech will integrate its random number generator (RNG) games and Live Casino with the first market covered by the company being New Jersey.</p>
<p>The titles will be placed with 888casino and the partnership will continue to develop by entering other regulated markets in the US. There are a number of potential jurisdictions where the two companies can work together, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Connecticut, Michigan, and others.</p>
<p>How the expansion moves, though, will depend on the companies’ immediate business priorities and their familiarity with the US iGaming sector. Commenting on this opportunity, Playtech CEO Shimon Akad welcomed the opportunity and said that this will be an important step forward for the company as its trusted partner, 888, has decided to extend its content offer with Playtech’s products.</p>
<p>Further Market to Be Explored Together</p>
<p>This means that Playtech will deliver on some of its newest and classic games at 888casino, opening up new opportunities for players and the local market.</p>
<p>We are proud to be supporting 888casino in delivering the very best online entertainment experience to its U.S. audience and we look forward to continuing this successful partnership with a market-leading operator. Playtech CEO Shimon Akad</p>
<p>888 US president Howard Mittman also welcomed this new tie-up as an opportunity to continue working with Playtech on important joint projects. The Live Casino and RNG segments are important for the company in the US, Mittman said. He added that 888casino and Playtech will collaborate closely to ensure that they can continue to deliver excellent experiences to players.</p>
