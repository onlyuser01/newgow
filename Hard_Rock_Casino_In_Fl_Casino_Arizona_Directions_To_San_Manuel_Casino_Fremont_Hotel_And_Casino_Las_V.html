<p>Kambi Group, a long-standing partner to LeoVegas, a company that was acquired by MGM Resorts International in July, has announced that it will extend its partnership with the gaming and betting operator through the BetMGM brand which recently launched in the UK with a Chris Rock marketing campaign.</p>
<p>LeoVegas has been working closely with Kambi Group for many years now and the acquisition of the former by MGM Resorts International has put into perspective Kambi’s powerful sports betting technology suite, Bet Builder tool, and AI-driven and powered algorithms that give clients a significant advantage.</p>

<p>Kambi Group CEO and Co-Founder Kristian Nylén was similarly excited about this new alliance. He said that his company was immensely proud of having had the opportunity to power BetMGM’s international launch in the United Kingdom owing to Kambi's close ties with LeoVegas.</p>
<p>It’s another opportunity to expand the existing good rapport between the partners, Nylén said. All in all, the executive noted that LeoVegas’ experiencein managing and running sports betting brands and Kambi’s proven technology would lead to significant gains for BetMGM and bring benefits to the brand’s customers.</p>
<p>BetMGM also went ahead with the launch of its online casino in the United Kingdom, marking another decisive step forward in the jurisdiction and the future of the company as an international powerhouse.</p>
<p>Kambi in the meantime has been confident in the success of its technology and used its Q2 trading update to express its determination to push its AI-poweredtrading solution further.</p>
