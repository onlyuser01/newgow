<p>Twain Sport, a newly launched live sports vertical by Hybrid Sports League and BetGames, is extending its reach in African markets through a partnership with Hollywoodbets. The deal will see the operator access a range of Twain Sport’s revolutionary content that is built to appeal to sports and gaming fans, and which will be available for players in the South African market where Hollywoodbets launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>Twain Sport Launches Hybrid Products with Hollywoodbets</p>
<p>The focus of this partnership is the delivery of live sports products which hold sway with the so-called “next-generation players.” Both companies have been reporting an increased demand for this type of live sports products which is why Twain Sport is enjoying more prominent partners from the gaming sector who are readily taking the company up on its offer.</p>
<p>Twain Sport has launched with T-basket which offers head-to-head basketball tournaments hourly, or 6,300 matches each month. The duration of each month only lasts three minutes, packing a lot of content for African bettors to explore and enjoy. An added benefit of the overall offer is the fact that the Twain Sport solutions come with an excellent UI and UX, mobile-first design and coding, and a large appeal with multiple audiences and demographics.</p>
<p>T-basket is the first product introduced to the African market, but more will be forthcoming, the company confirmed in a press release. The next product to launch in the region is T-kick which will be available in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>BetGames VP of sales for Africa, James Everett, welcomed this opportunity and said that the launch of Twain Sport was largely successful in Europe, and now the company was seeking to debut its products in the African market, and enjoying a good reception:</p>
<p>T-basket has already been met with approval from African players and the anticipation for a similar football product in T-kick is only going see revenue grow accordingly. BetGames VP of sales for Africa, James Everett</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets head of product Wayde Dorkin was similarly pleased with the development and said that the company was very happy to expand with what is innovative and previously unseen in the market product. He further added:</p>
<p>The rapid play and betting markets available are perfect for today’s consumers and the prospect of T-kick’s imminent arrival adds to that excitement. Hollywoodbets head of product Wayde Dorkin</p>
<p>Twain Sport is bringing its innovative product to other realms of the experience as well. For one, the company is also venturing out into other realms of the betting experience with products and projects in esports and virtual sports. The company also works with Sportradar’s Fraud Detection System and ensures that all of its products are reliable and safe.</p>
