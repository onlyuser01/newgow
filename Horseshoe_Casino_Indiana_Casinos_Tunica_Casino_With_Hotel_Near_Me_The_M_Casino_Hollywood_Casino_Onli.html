    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Indiana Casinos Tunica Casino With Hotel Near Me The M Casino Hollywood Casino Onli</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>Facts 1</p>
<p>The player has an inactive player account at this casino because he self-excluded. The player has so far lost all his deposits in this casino and in order not to have any further losses here he has asked for exclusion. Access is blocked. The account is visually verified.</p>
<p>Facts 2</p>
<p>The player has now logged in again. The player recently changed his family name to get back to gambling!! The new identity card has the same data as for the first player account, only that there is a different family name.</p>
<p>Apparently the account was verified and the player was admitted and again lost â‚¬290 until they asked for closure again via the service chat. The account has been blocked.</p>
<p>Apparently the casino would be asked to return the funds as this is prohibited by law. The casino was aware that there was already a banned player under this record, but they still allowed the player entry.</p>
<p>Excerpt slothunter : Dear Friend,</p>
<p>According to our Terms&amp;Conditions "Each player can create only one personal player account per person, household address, email address, telephone number, ip and shared computer. Creating multiple user accounts by a player will lead to termination of the accounts and confiscation of any gained winnings and active bonuses."</p>
<p>So, we have to refuse your request and close accounts for violation of Casino's T&amp;C.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Slothunter Casino Support Team</p>
