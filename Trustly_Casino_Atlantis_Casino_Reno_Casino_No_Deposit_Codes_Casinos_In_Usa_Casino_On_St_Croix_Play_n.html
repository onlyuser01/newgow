<p>Play’n GO is building up its momentum in the iGaming market in North America nicely, with the company delivering its world-class portfolio of titles to the Great Lakes States in Michigan. This market entry and launch are important for the local iGaming ecosystem as they are for the supplier, which is committed to scaling its reach in the fast-evolving North American gaming landscape.</p>
<p>From Ontario to New Jersey, Play’n GO is determined to introduce more of its products in regulated jurisdictions across the region. This means that local players will get their hands on some delectable treats, such as Xmas Joker, Rich Wilde and the Book of Dead, Crystal Sun, and Rich Wilde and the Tome of Madness, among many other top-shelf titles that have won players the world over.</p>
<p>Play’n GO is fully committed to bringing all of its leading titles to the US market and has established the latest partnership in Michigan with the help of BetMGM, another prominent brand and purveyor of iGaming and sports betting options. BetMGM and Play’n GO are following up on their previous partnership that saw the pair launch the games in New Jersey in October.</p>
<p>The continuation of this partnership clearly demonstrates both brands’ commitment to expanding their clout in the regulated online casino gaming space, which is set to be even bigger than sports betting even if a regulation has been slower to move. Play’n GO Chief Commercial Officer Magnus Olsson welcomed the opportunity to grow the supplier’s reach in yet another jurisdiction in the highly dynamic US market.</p>
<p>"We believe strongly that the future of the industry will be in regulated spaces," Olsson noted. He also spoke about the importance of the supplier breaking ground in both Michigan and New Jersey, with more states in the coming months. Olsson suggested that in the next one to two years, the number of iGaming states in the US will grow exponentially.</p>
<p>This mostly has to do with the success that sports betting has enjoyed. However, there is compelling evidence that already demonstrates the added value of online gambling, which is generating bigger tax revenue for the state. Fears that the online casino sector will hurt the land-based sector have been put to rest as well.</p>
<p>"Our teams enjoy nothing more than working closely with our partners to help them achieve their business goals using our content and expertise," the executive concluded, adding that the launch with BetMGM is a fantastic opportunity for the two companies’ partnership. Play’n GO is bringing more than 50 online slots and has operations in Ontario, New Jersey, and since Monday – Michigan in the North American market.</p>
