<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>The player has been detected of having multiple accounts. The matches between the accounts are by IP and Cookie:</p>
<p>IP FM: 2.247.248.197</p>
<p>Cookie: FM: rk423b22ddf65ef2ba8c9832c8e58a168e7f97c92k2a803bf213f73C6a31al47</p>
<p>As per the Casino’s Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>"3.5. A Customer may open one account only on the Website and with the company. Any additional accounts that are opened may be closed by the company, withholding, or declining all payments or in other cases, all such accounts may be treated as one joint account and merged together by the company, in either case at the company's sole and absolute discretion. The Customer agrees that the company shall use any method it deems reasonable to determine if two or more accounts belong to the same customer.</p>
<p>3.10. The customer’s account must be registered on his/her own, personal, and correct, name and personal details. The customer must ensure that all data given at the registration stage is true, complete, and free from error. Registration is allowed only once per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, site cookies, IP address, and shared computer, i.e. Public library or workplace and cannot share any of the aforementioned with a previously registered account. This therefore also means that the customer has to register personally. Furthermore, a customer can only have one account. Any other accounts which a customer opens with the company, or which are beneficially owned by the customer shall be considered duplicate accounts. Hot.bet shall close any duplicate account/s consequent to the identification of the main account. If Hot.bet closes a duplicate account all bonuses, free bets, and winnings acquired using that duplicate account will be void and forfeited. If the amount in the duplicate account does not cover the amount to be refunded to Hot.bet, Hot.bet shall seek to recover the loss incurred directly from any other of your accounts."</p>
<p>The detected usage of multiple accounts is in direct breach of the T&amp;C to which the player agreed on upon registration.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the winnings are voided and the account is closed.</p>
<p>We hope this will clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Hot.Bet Casino Team</p>
