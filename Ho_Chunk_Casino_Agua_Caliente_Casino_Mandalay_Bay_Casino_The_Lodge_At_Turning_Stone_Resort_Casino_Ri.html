    <h1>Ho Chunk Casino Agua Caliente Casino Mandalay Bay Casino The Lodge At Turning Stone Resort Casino Ri</h1>

<p>Dear brennanpatrice1,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>Could you please tell me what is the expiry date of your provisional driving license?</p>
<p>Does the provisional driving license contain your photograph?</p>
<p>Do you have any other identity document containing your photograph that you could provide the casino with?</p>
<p>I have checked the Casino’s Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found about the KYC verification:</p>
<p>Account must be activated through the Welcome email and KYC verified by uploading the following documents:</p>
<p>Coloured Photocopy/Picture of your ID card, Passport or Driver's License. We need to see your full name, D.O.B and Expiry Date; Real-time photo ( "selfie" ) while holding the front and back sides of the document you chose, under your chin; Coloured Photocopy/Picture/Screenshot of a recent Utility bill / Bank statement (no older than 3 months) showing the issue date, your name, address and the company logo; To upload the documents, please log into your Account and go to My Account &gt; Profile Details &gt; ID Documents. Under "Upload new Documents" you can choose the file with the necessary documentation to upload. Alternatively you can send an email to our Customer Support.</p>
<p>All the documents need to match the following criteria:</p>
<p>Allowed Images file formats: PNG, JPEG and GIF and not bigger than 5mb; PDF files are not accepted; Scanned images should be in colour, in high resolution (at least 300 dpi) and NOT cropped; Utility bills and Bank statement documents need to content issue date (no older than 3 months), your name, address and the company logo; Real-time photo ("selfie") must be taken in high resolution, good lighting, no flash used, no makeup, sunglasses, hats or any other disguise and the chosen document under your chin. Please note that the Information on your document must be clearly visible. Take note that documents need to be uploaded to your account up to 30 days upon registration or before your first withdrawal, or else the account will be closed until these documents are provided. In some cases further documents might be requested to truly identify that the account holder is real. All transactions will be checked for Money Laundering. Customers will be notified via email about their verification status (KYC), within 24 hours of providing their documents.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
