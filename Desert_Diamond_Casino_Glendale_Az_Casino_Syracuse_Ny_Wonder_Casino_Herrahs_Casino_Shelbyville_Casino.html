    <h1>Desert Diamond Casino Glendale Az Casino Syracuse Ny Wonder Casino Herrahs Casino Shelbyville Casino</h1>

<p>The deposits were made in English pound and credited on to my account in English pounds as an example if I transferred £100 my online account would receive £100 but then the card services provider would put their fees on top so even though I only asked to transfer £100 the card services provider would charge my account £104 I sent a copy of my bank statement showing only there deposited money and a copy of the funds the casino actually credited my online account, I was told if I done this I would be credited immediately but the thing that really upset me, was them saying they had actually reimbursed me, because the moment I checked it out I knew I had been scammed,</p>
<p>The banks at first did not want to listen but when I explained to them that the casino had promised to refund my transfer fees and haven't done so and because every transfer I made had a fee attached to it the bank allowed me to contest every payment they said that I couldn't contest any money that I had gambled, and I replied to them at this stage I am just interested in understanding why this casino hasn't refunded me and from what I can see and have read online this casino is non bonafidee if that turns out to be true then I will contest all monies paid to the casino as they received my funds under false pretences and have no intention of paying out ever.</p>
