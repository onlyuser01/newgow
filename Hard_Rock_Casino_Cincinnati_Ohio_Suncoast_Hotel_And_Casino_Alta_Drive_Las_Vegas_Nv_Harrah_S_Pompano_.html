<p>With competition in Ontario at an all-time high, adopting Paysafe’s payment solutions will be a priority for many of the region’s iGaming and online sports betting companies. The move marks another milestone expansion for the payment provider as it maintains its significant North American momentum and gains access to a lucrative new market.</p>
<p>The Company Is a Valued Partner for Many Operators</p>
<p>With the expansion, Paysafe aims to offer a range of payment solutions that cater to the needs of businesses, primarily targeting iGaming and online sportsbook operators. Its proprietary payment processing technology provides merchants with a seamless and secure payment experience, enabling them to accept various payment methods, including credit and debit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers.</p>
<p>The company’s flagship Skrill digital wallet has proven its merits with operators across North America. In January, the company launched in Ohio, capitalizing on the state’s freshly-launched online sports betting market. This move and the recent entry into Ontario build on Paysafe’s 2022 successful expansions and partnerships.</p>
<p>Seamless cashouts are another crucial feature of Paysafe’s offerings, allowing players to access the funds in their Skrill accounts in real-time. Users can quickly and easily spend them at supporting merchants or withdraw them directly to their linked bank accounts. The company’s flexible solutions have proven capable of meeting the evolving needs of merchants and consumers.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s Solutions Will Vastly Benefit the Ontarian Market</p>
<p>Paysafe’s services will allow Ontarians to quickly link their bank accounts to the Skrill digital wallet, enabling seamless online bank transfer deposits. The provider’s Paysafecash eCash solution offers an alternative funding method, catering to most iGaming and online sports betting users. Paysafe President of global gaming Zak Cutler noted that the Ontario expansion was a natural next step for the company, expressing confidence in its success in the region.</p>
<p>We expect the upgraded wallet to be just as well received north of the border, with Skrill giving Ontarian operators a competitive edge. Zak Cutler, Paysafe President of global gaming</p>
<p>Ontario provides a unique opportunity for Paysafe due to the region’s 44 operators and 75 gaming websites. The number significantly exceeds most US states, allowing the payment provider to leverage existing partnerships and create new collaboration opportunities. Ontario’s extremely competitive environment means that Paysafe’s solutions may be just what they need to gain an edge.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s Ontario expansion marks a positive development for the payments industry in Canada. The company’s commitment to refining its products will be instrumental to bolstering businesses in the province, driving growth, and improving the customer experience. With its global reach at an all-time high, Paysafe is well underway another stellar year.</p>
