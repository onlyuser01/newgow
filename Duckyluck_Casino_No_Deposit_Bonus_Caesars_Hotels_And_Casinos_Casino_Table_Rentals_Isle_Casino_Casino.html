<p>The Vegas Golden Knights, one of the most prominent National Hockey League (NHL) franchises, and Betfred, a leading sportsbook company in the United States and Europe, have signed a new partnership, the NHL announced on its official website.</p>
<p>The partnership was signed on Tuesday, January 31, and will see the two companies work together for the next several years, as Betfred steps in as the Official Sports Betting Partner for the Knights, continuing its own growth in the United States.</p>
<p>This opportunity was immediately welcomed by Vegas Golden Knights President Kerry Bubolz who was excited to welcome Betfred, an established betting company, as part of the team’s allies. Bubolz commented:</p>
<p>"Betfred's US business is Vegas Born just like we are, and we're excited to help them launch their brand in Nevada."</p>
<p>This alliance is designed to ultimately benefit the fans, the companies stated. The Golden Knights will work on interactive contests and events for its fans and provide audiences with more ways to engage with their favorite team through the Betfred brand.</p>
<p>Betfred will naturally gain circumference signage on-site at the T-Mobile Arena, home of the Vegas Knights, and across NHL broadcasts. The two companies will work together to boost each other’s brand awareness and provide unique opportunities to fans and bettors.</p>
<p>Betfred will have its logo and assets incorporated into the Knights’ digital channels, giving the brand a further boost and increasingits presence in the United States. Betfred Sportsbook COO Bryan Bennett also commented on this partnership, saying that the company is excited to be part of this journey.</p>
<p>Bennett also said that the Betfred brand is going ahead with a dedicated hometown sportsbook which will be set up at the Virgin Hotel Las Vegas in collaboration with Mohegan Casino Las Vegas. The latest partnership is not just about awareness, though, Bennett said, explaining that his team will look to support the brand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to growing our business here and supporting Las Vegas hockey in the process," he concluded. Betfred has been pushing in the United States, with the brand looking to secure new market access deals avidly.</p>
<p>Betfred has been able to gain entry in Ohio through a partnership with the Cincinnati Bengals and in Maryland, as the company is continuing to gather momentum in the fast-growing sports betting market in the United States.</p>
