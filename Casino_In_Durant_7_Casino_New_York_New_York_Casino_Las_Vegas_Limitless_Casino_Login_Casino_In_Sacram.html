    <h1>Casino In Durant 7 Casino New York New York Casino Las Vegas Limitless Casino Login Casino In Sacram</h1>

<p>Just an update on my recent case Betfred have emailed me back stating that there was multi misspelling in my registration process the only thing that was correct on file was my first name of my date of birth, which they are right there are multiple mistakes in my personal information, but the mistakes have lead me wonder now how did they verify me and allow me to deposit because all government data bases electoral roll and soft credit searches which the online casinos use would have rectified any mistakes and would have corrected my surname and possibly my number as my mobile phone number is linked to my Experian and other credit referencing agencies. Also if my information was wrong upon signing up to the casino site then surely they would not of been able to verify me and let me gamble and deposit as for all they knew I could of been a 14 year old boy gambling. Personally I think they have verified me through credit searches and saw me coming to cash in on as I’m listed as a self excluded gambler! I’ve also got multi emails from Betfred enticing me with promo adverts for play with £10 get 100 spins for free and so on which is a struggle I have to deal with on a daily basis every time I open my social media! Just to add the LCCP clearly notes under</p>
<p>17.1.1 - Customer identity verification</p>
<p>Licensees must obtain and verify information in order to establish the identity of a customer before that customer is permitted to gamble. Information must include, but is not restricted to, the customer’s name, address and date of birth.</p>
<p>so how would the casino of verified me if my details were incorrect?</p>
<p>Also as a self excluded addicted gambler I should of been listed and flagged not to receive any marketing promos which I have been receiving and I have been getting a lot on my social media platforms for some reason!</p>
<p>going back to the verification process I feel like Betfred have breached this and have been negligent in protecting vulnerable customers</p>
