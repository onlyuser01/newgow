    <h1>Online Casino Illinois Cherokee Casino Hotel Roland Treasure Bay Casino Hotel Casino Real Directions</h1>

<p>Asian Poker Tour, the premier poker tour in Asia, has reinforced its leadership team with a new addition. The event organizer named the experienced Fred Leung, former PokerStars exec, as its new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>APT Names Leung as CEO</p>
<p>Leung is no stranger to poker. The experienced executive has spent over a decade with PokerStars Macau, helping the brand host some of the biggest events in the region. His last position saw him work as PokerStars Live Events’ senior marketing and business development manager for Asia.</p>
<p>During his time with PokerStars, Leung was responsible for overseeing some of the biggest poker tournaments in Macau and Asia as a whole. This includes notable events including Macau Millions, the Macau Poker Cup and the Asia Championship of Poker.</p>
<p>As CEO of Asian Poker Tour, Leung will be responsible for maintaining the tour’s leadership position as one of the best event organizers in Asia. To that end, Leung will collaborate with Lloyd Fontillas, general manager and executive tournament director at Asian Poker Tour, to host the APT Philippines 2022 at the Newport World Resorts.</p>
<p>For reference, the aforementioned event is scheduled to begin on September 6.</p>
<p>Leung Is Happy to Head the APT</p>
<p>Leung joins the Asian Poker Tour in the wake of Jeff Mann’s leave. The former CEO left the company when Asianlogic Group sold the APT to APT Events Private. Michael Soyza, a professional poker player and an associate of APT Events Private, spoke about the new chief executive.</p>
<p>According to Soyza, picking Leung as the new CEO was a no-brainer thanks to the latter’s experience and success in the Far East. The poker pro added that all shareholders agreed with the decision and that Asian Poker Tour is “ecstatic” to have him head the company. Soyza concluded that he is sure Leung is the best person for the job and will “raise the APT to new heights.”</p>
<p>Leung himself commented on his new position at the company. He said that he is “beyond excited” at this opportunity and is delighted to join APT. He lauded the company for its strong presence in the region and said that the brand’s objective now is to retain its legacy while still evolving and remaining competitive.</p>
<p>Leung revealed that APT’s new ownership group was a big reason for his decision to join the team. He described APT Events Private as an aggressive, ambitious and passionate brand that truly cares about poker.</p>
