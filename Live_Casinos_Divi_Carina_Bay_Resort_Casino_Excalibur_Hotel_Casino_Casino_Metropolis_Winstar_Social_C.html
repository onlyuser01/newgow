<p>INTRALOT announced today that it has penned a new 5-year sports betting contract with the Ohio Lottery Commission. The provider will supply retail sportsbooks in the state with solutions once sports betting goes live in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p>INTRALOT, a gaming industry supplier, has signed a new 5-year sports betting contract with the Ohio Lottery Commission. Thanks to this, the former party will be able to provide retailers and customers in the state with its critically-acclaimed solutions.</p>
<p>INTRALOT Will Leverage the Orion Sportsbook Solution</p>
<p>As agreed with the Ohio Lottery, Intralot will implement its INTRALOT Orion Sportsbook solution. As a result, the supplier will leverage existing lottery equipment and infrastructure to make the launch of sports betting across Ohio much easier.</p>
<p>Under the deal, the project will go live in January 2023, in accordance with the launch of sports betting in Ohio. It will see INTRALOT power 700 retail sports betting locations with its solutions – a number that is expected to grow to more than 1,000 in a few more months.</p>
<p>INTRALOT also announced that it has received a provisional license through the Ohio Casino Commission to operate this contract. The final five-year license, meanwhile, is expected to be issued at the beginning of 2023, “shortly after” January 1, the provider added.</p>
<p>This is not INTRALOT’s first step into the Buckeye State. On the contrary, the supplier has supported the local market for over a decade now. Ever since 2009, the company has been providing a secure central gaming system in the state, delivering, managing and accounting for all legal Ohio Lottery games in the state.</p>
<p>Ohio to Soon Welcome Sports Betting</p>
<p>Ohio, meanwhile, is set to legalize sports betting starting January 1. The state has long fought to legalize gambling and is now preparing to officially launch wagering on sports. Many industry enthusiasts are excited about this launch, considering Ohio’s potential.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that the state could potentially become one of the top betting markets in America, ramping up hype about the launch.</p>
<p>With sports betting on the table, the state is now licensing operators and suppliers that will be permitted to offer their products in the state. For example, the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the Buckeye regulator, just licensed FansUnite, providing the British Colombia-based sports betting and entertainment company with a sports gaming supplier license.</p>
<p>Earlier, the authority also greenlit the launch of Underdog Sports, one of the fastest-growing fantasy sports companies. Thanks to this, Underdog will be able to launch on the Ohioan betting market from day one.</p>
<p>Australia-based operator PlayUp, on the other hand, failed to secure a license because of potential illegal gambling activity related to the company’s PlayUp Slots+ product. The Ohio Casino Control Commission said it may rethink its stance if the operator remedies the issues.</p>
