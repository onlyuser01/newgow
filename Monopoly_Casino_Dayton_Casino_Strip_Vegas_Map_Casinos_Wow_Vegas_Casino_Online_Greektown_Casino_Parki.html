    <h1>Monopoly Casino Dayton Casino Strip Vegas Map Casinos Wow Vegas Casino Online Greektown Casino Parki</h1>

<p>I have been playing Raging Bull for a very long time. I had never withdrawn money until a few weeks ago Friday. I had my money up to $4400 so I decided to withdraw money via coindraw. I made a withdrawl of $2500, which was processed but did not come out of my casino balance, but I did receive an email and I was then blocked from making any additional withdrawls, so I was not able to withdraw the rest of my winnings. It was not removed from my account but I did receive an email that my withdrawl was requested. They say that the coin drawl would process within 30 min. The next day I did not see anything come through and I reached out and was told by the VIP representative that I would be paid out the $2500, I have multiple screenshots. I was told they had issues with their coindraw bitcoin system and they would process my request in the next few days once they get it straightened out. I reached out Monday and I was told that I was the one to cancel my withdraw and that I will not get my money, I tried to explain that I did reach out and was told I would get my payout due to their technical issues over the weekend. Fast forward two weeks and I am now being told that I canceled the transaction and therefor I will not get any pay out. I tried to explain that had their system been working I would have no only been able to get my $2500 but then the additional $1700 if I was not blocked from making additional withdrawls.. and had my coindraw withdraw processed correctly and they were not having "technical issues" on their end. I was told that a handful of people have experienced this same situation and I am not the only one with the Coinbase withdrawl issues. To date they have continued to tell me they can no longer help me and I will not get the money because I cancelled it on my end. I have multiple screenshots of conversations where I am told it was their technical issues and that I am due the money. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
