    <h1>Sugar House Casino Casinos Laughlin Nv Wynn Casinos Casino Rewards Casino With Hotel Bovada Casino P</h1>

<p>Dear ambermonroe1969,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked promotional terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Refer A Friend - Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>To be eligible for a Refer-a-Friend bonus, the referring player must have at least one successful deposit of $20 or more in their Bovada account prior to the referred friend opening and funding their account with a qualifying first deposit of $20 or more.</p>
<p>The Refer-a-Friend bonus is intended to reward existing players for introducing "NEW" customers to Bovada and as such, any abuse of the referral program will not be tolerated. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Opening an account solely for the purpose of obtaining a referral bonus.</p>
<p>The usage of VoIPs, a VPN, proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of your real location.</p>
<p>If we are unable to validate each players’ individuality or if the new referred accounts are not considered genuine.</p>
<p>The referring player or referred friend are considered bonus abusers.</p>
<p>Bovada.lv reserves the right to restrict eligibility for Refer-a-Friend bonuses, forfeit winnings, or carry out further sanctions on an account if it is found to be in violation of any of the herein mentioned terms.</p>
<p>If a referred player is found to be violating any terms of service, your account may also be negatively affected.</p>
<p>Please see Bovada’s Terms of Service for general rules which apply to any and all promotions."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if your account passed successfully the KYC verification in the past?</p>
<p>If there's any relevant communication, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
