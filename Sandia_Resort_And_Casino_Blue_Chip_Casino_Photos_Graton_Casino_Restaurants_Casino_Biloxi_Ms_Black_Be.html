<p>One of the world’s largest online sports betting and casino gaming websites BetOnline.ag made history today by becoming the first gaming operator to accept ApeCoin payments.</p>
<p>Pioneering ApeCoin Adoption in Gaming</p>
<p>The announcement that BetOnline is adding ApeCoin ($APE) to the list of approved cryptocurrencies was made via the Odds PR agency. It followed shortly after the debut of the ERC-20 token on crypto exchanges on Thursday, March 17.</p>
<p>Created by Yuga Labs, the parent company of Bored Ape Yacht Club, another popular project in the non-fungible token (NFT) space, ApeCoin began trading on the crypto exchanges to put an end to months of hype and speculation.</p>
<p>“We got in early on Bitcoin because we are confident blockchain is the future of global currency,” commented BetOnline chief executive officer Eddie Robins III.</p>
<p>“And now, it’s incredibly exciting to start adding NFTs to our asset vault and be the first in our industry to accept ApeCoin. We’re bullish on the world of Web3, and we’re eager to build and strengthen our partnerships and promotions in this space.” Eddie Robbins III, CEO, BetOnline</p>
<p>The sports betting and online casino gaming platform was among the early adopters of cryptocurrencies as it began accepting Bitcoin for transactions in 2010. BetOnline made its first entry into the NFT market during the Super Bowl LVI week in February when it purchased Bored Ape #320 for $375,000.</p>
<p>Crypto-Friendly High-Level Security Platform</p>
<p>BetOnline’s list of accepted cryptocurrencies as payment options includes more than a dozen altcoins, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, Avalanche, Cardano, Polygon, Solana and USDC.</p>
<p>The operator gained popularity among crypto communities for its high-level of security, instantaneous deposits and withdrawals with no transaction fees, on top of the highest deposit limit in the gaming industry of $500,000.</p>
<p>“We’ve established ourselves as the go-to sportsbook, poker and casino platform for crypto players who want the best gaming experience that is guaranteed by anonymity and transparency. The security of our customers has been, and will always be, the top priority at BetOnline.” Eddie Robbins III, CEO, BetOnline</p>
<p>BetOnline was among the first buyers of $APE, having acquired 10,094 APE tokens on Thursday morning, and according to a company’s spokesperson, it has no intention of selling its newly adopted ApeCoin any time soon.</p>
