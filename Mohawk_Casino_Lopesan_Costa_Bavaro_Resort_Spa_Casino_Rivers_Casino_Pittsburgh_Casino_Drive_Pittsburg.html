<p>We received this email from Hugo:</p>
<p>"Hello ... I'm sorry to have said some bad words but I'm really tired of what they did to me in that casino .. about 3 months ago I made a deposit in the spin million of € 30 .. meanwhile I started playing after about 2 hours. jackpot of 11,000 € .. and i was super happy derived from the sum .. meanwhile i validated all my documents .. i sent it all as they asked me .. i even think the casino can do whatever it wants with my documents because i sent everything .. even I myself to hold the documents .. meanwhile I was asked for more and more papers .. until recently I was asked to go to a notary to validate the documents .. I as I thought that they would never pay me anything I continued to play .. I spent a lot .. meanwhile I only had € 3400 I was playing and a new € 20,000 jackpot came out again .. I got a total sum of € 25000 because I left a few more prizes .. after an hour of leaving this jackpot got into a lucky wheel because it told me there were free spins there .. I rode around and gave me a 10 dollar ticket .. as if I had won another 10 dollars .. in the meantime I was going to make a new withdrawal request and they told me it wasn’t possible… because as I had entered the wheel of luck and had given me those 10 $ now I would have to play again until I paid the sum of 275 $ they said they were rules of the game .. I spoke with the operator and the owner told me to continue playing the wheel of luck until I paid those 275 $ .. I in my innocence I continued to play ... meanwhile the same 10 or 10 $ blihete came out to me in the meantime ... to my amazement after playing the 275 $ now I have 3000 and a few in debt for the same game! In other words ... the casino is corrupt ... it is causing me to lose all my money by playing in the wheel of luck! I want to take this to court because I was the victim of a huge scam .. .. I didn't play again! What I want to gain from this is to have access to what is mine since I made a deposit .. so if I win a prize they have to pay me! I don't think these are cases to play with! There are € 24000 stopped at the casino for 3 months and they will never send me anything! I think it's a huge robbery ... I didn't even go to the notary because of this thing now that they invented this wheel of luck ... tell me ... do you think I better contact a lawyer and proceed with a criminal complaint over the casino? They kept all my documents ... I don't know what I can do ... thanks ... I am waiting for an answer ... "</p>
