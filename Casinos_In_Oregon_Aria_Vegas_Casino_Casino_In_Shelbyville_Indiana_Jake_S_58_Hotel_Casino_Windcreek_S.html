<p>Play’n GO, the 2005-founded supplier of online slots with a portfolio currently available in more than 25 jurisdictions, has announced the launch of Rascal Riches, a fresh animal-themed game with “cracking action, detailed animation and a fun story” as described by the company’s head of game retention, George Olekszy.</p>

<p>Join the Mission, Grab the Golden Trashcan!</p>
<p>Rascal Riches tells a captivating tale of three racoons who are on an important mission: to find the Golden Trashcan. For this, they jump one on top of the other and disguise themselves as a tall man wearing a trench coat, a fedora and a moustache.</p>
<p>With the help of grappling hooks, pliers, screwdrivers, flashlights, and padlocks, the cute rogue characters are getting ready for the greatest heist in history. The good news is they still have one more room left in their trench coat.</p>
<p>Players who are eager to join the gripping storyline can expect to find the following features:</p>
<p>Stacked Rascal Wilds, Multipliers, and Mystery Symbols</p>
<p>To grab a standard win, players must land a minimum of three of the previously mentioned handy gadgets across the 20 available paylines on the grid.</p>
<p>The symbol of the three rascals represents the Stacked Rascal Wild in the game. This can show up randomly during any spin, right to left, landing on any reel. The Wild symbol uncovers the three hiding raccoons inside the trench coat, letting players glimpse into the secret skills.</p>
<p>Multiplier. This is the ability of the Leader Racoon and it can apply a Multiplier between x2 to x5 to all wins generated during the same spin. The same Multiplier ability can be applied to the rest of the raccoons, thus adding the total to any current wins.</p>
<p>Mystery Symbols. Lieutenant Racoon, which is the second raccoon in charge, is able to drop Mystery Symbols on the reels onto the reels and uncover either low-paying or high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>For added action on the grid, multiple racoons can drop Mystery Symbols along with the Multiplier. Even more, Wild Rascals are also capable of splitting symbols in half for even more opportunities to win big.</p>
<p>Free Spins and Junkyard Jackpot. Players who land at least three Golden Trash Cans trigger the Free Spins round where they will come across all the other features for even more chances of hitting the Junkyard Jackpot.</p>
<p>Prior to the final Free Spin, the Golden Trash Can symbol reveals the Final Spin Multiplier which can be x20, x30, x50, or x100. Extra Multiplier bonuses are also available.</p>
<p>Last week, Play’n GO released Sweet Alchemy 2, a slot packed with free spins, multipliers, and the iconic grid expansion mechanic. At the start of June, the supplier announced the launch of Ternion, a superhero-themed game featuring progressive free spins.</p>
