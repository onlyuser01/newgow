<p>Xpoint Verify is now live with BET99 after the product was embedded within the operator's betting and gaming platforms</p>
<p>Fast-growing geolocation technology services provider Xpoint added another partner to its roster of geolocation partnerships after signing an agreement with online sports betting and casino platform operator BET99.</p>
<p>Xpoint Verify to Enhance Customer Safety</p>
<p>As a provider of geolocation and compliance services to the sports betting, iGaming and fantasy sports markets in North America, Xpoint will provide Canadian-based operator BET99 with its Xpoint Verify product to ensure a safe, secure and fraud-free customer engagement for the operator.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Paul Nyzuk, chief technology officer at BET99, outlined that Xpoint is the perfect choice for a geolocation and geoverification services provider, offering more data points that can be used to detect fraud and “offering more data than other major geoverification services.”</p>
<p>“The partnership also fits with BET99’s mandate to leverage innovative technologies to deliver an online betting experience like no other,” Nyzuk concluded.</p>
<p>Following the partnership, Xpoint Verify is now live with BET99 in Ontario as the product has been embedded within the operator’s sports betting and online casino gaming platforms, allowing Ontario players a higher level of security in their engagement with the operator.</p>
<p>Growing List of North American Partners</p>
<p>Marvin Sanderson, chief executive officer of Xpoint, was delighted “to add the Canadian market-leading sports betting platform” to Xpoint’s “growing list of live partners” and help the operator continue with its rapid progress in expanding their brand’s reach in North America.</p>
<p>“As we expand our North American footprint, we’re building more tools and systems specifically designed to help our partners utilize their location-based data for fraud analysis and micro geofencing services,” Sanderson added.</p>
<p>Providing two geoverification technology products, Xpoint Lite and Xpoint Verify, Xpoint has already partnered with a number of operators in Canada and the US and is one of only two geolocation technology services providers holding a vendor license in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Among the list of its recent partners are fantasy sports platform Underdog Fantasy which inked an Xpoint Lite deal last week, Toronto-based sports, esports and casino operator Rivalry which hired Xpoint as its geolocation and compliance partner in November, iGaming operator PlayStar, and others.</p>
<p>To engage with sports fans in Canada, BET99 announced a partnership deal with former Toronto FC soccer player Sebastian Giovinco ahead of the FIFA 2022 World Cup. The agreement expanded BET99’s roster of popular sports personalities adding to the names of UFC Hall of Famer Georges St-Pierre, Toronto Maple Leafs’ young star Auston Matthews and two-time Olympian Alysha Newman.</p>
<p>Last month, BET99 became the latest member of the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), willing to contribute to the organization’s efforts to protect sports integrity to the benefit of both consumers and businesses.</p>
