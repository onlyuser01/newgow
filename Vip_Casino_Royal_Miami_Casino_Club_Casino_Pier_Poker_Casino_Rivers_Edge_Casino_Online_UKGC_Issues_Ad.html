    <h1>Vip Casino Royal Miami Casino Club Casino Pier Poker Casino Rivers Edge Casino Online UKGC Issues Ad</h1>

<p>The UKGC has announced further sanctions for Caesars Entertainment’s PML holders, as part of its investigation into the operator.</p>
<p>On-Going Review into CEUK</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission addressed today the failings of Caesars Entertainment’s (CEUK) personal management license holders (PML) and announced additional sanctions. The regulator issued a record £13 million regulatory settlement due to CEUK’s “systematic failings” in April 2020, following the UKGC’s investigation into “social responsibility, money laundering and customer interaction failures including those involving VIPs”. Three senior managers had then surrendered their license once they had learned of the review.</p>
<p>The regulator discovered last year that the global gambling operator had allowed a customer to spend £820,000 and lose £240,000 at a London casino over 13 months, without confirming the source of funds. CEUK also failed to obtain proof of source of funds for a high-risk player, although the individual was able to gamble £800,000 and lose £795,000.</p>
<p>PML Holders Sanctioned</p>
<p>The UKGC, therefore, issued a record fine of £13 million, or about $16.1 million, and carried on with its investigation. The review led to warnings issued to seven PML holders, while two PML holders received advice to conduct letters.</p>
<p>Eighteen PML holders have also received advice to conduct letters although they were not under review, while one PML holder decided to surrender their license during the investigation, although they were not officially under review.</p>
<p>One PML holder had their license revoked for not paying fees, as another member of staff saw their license revoked after an altercation with a customer.</p>
<p>Richard Watson, UKGC executive director, stated that “all personal license holders should be aware that they will be held accountable, where appropriate, for the regulatory failings within the operators they manage.”</p>
