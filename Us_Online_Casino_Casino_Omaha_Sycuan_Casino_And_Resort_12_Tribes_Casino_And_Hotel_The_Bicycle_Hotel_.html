<p>Two leading gaming innovators have teamed up with Relax Gaming now agreeing to distribute NetGaming’s products, offering better scalability and awareness.</p>
<p>NetGaming and Relax Gaming Team Up for Platform-to-Platform Deal</p>
<p>Relax Gaming and NetGaming have signed up a partnership that will help with the distribution of innovative gaming content. Relax Gaming is a platform that focuses on selling content from leading and select suppliers, with the latest addition of NetGaming.</p>
<p>As a result, NetGaming will officially be recognized as one of Relax Gaming’s Powered By brands, bringing more exposure to the company. NetGaming is a brand-new player on the casino landscape, having rapidly developed throughout 2019, with offices in the United Kingdom and India.</p>
<p>The company has a lot of top talent on the executive talent and not least of all Pallavi Deshmukh, an industry veteran with over a decade of experience. Quickly recognized for their focus on innovation, NetGaming has already released two player-favorite games, to name Candy Burst and Age of DaVinci.</p>
<p>Spreading the Word Through the ‘Powered By’ Experience</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has a hefty portfolio of connections and the company has equally focused on developing some stand-alone content. NetGaming stands to benefit from the exposure that Relax has already achieved, helping the start-up developer receive better exposure. Here’s what Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming CPO, had to say on the occasion:</p>
<p>“Relax Gaming’s partnership programs were designed to be revolutionary. We have broken away from the market trend to segment relationships between studios and operators, instead injecting transparency and flexibility into content distribution.</p>
<p>Our platform-to-platform deal with NetGaming underlines the success of this pioneering approach, providing it with a commercially transparent route to market as it continues to build its portfolio of quality content.”</p>
<p>NetGaming Pallavi Deshmukh also commented on the latest developments highlighting a ‘significant milestone. Deshmukh didn’t hesitate to describe the partnership as a long-term opportunity:</p>
<p>“Today NetGaming has achieved another significant milestone. We are delighted to join the Relax Gaming content distribution network and are super excited to start our long-term partnership.</p>
<p>NetGaming has a lot in store and we are hoping to delight our customers as we continue to grow working alongside Relax Gaming’s knowledgeable and creative team.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has rapidly grown its portfolio in recent months, now providing its partners with a roster of over 640 casino games, including high-quality aggregated content from selected Silver Bullet studios together with innovative proprietary products.”</p>
<p>NetGaming’s Plans</p>
<p>NetGaming has some exciting news for 2020. The company is planning to shift into a higher gear and publish at least 2 games a month. In addition, the studio expects to deliver at least 2 branded slots every year, but this is still subject to negotiations with the relevant parties.</p>
