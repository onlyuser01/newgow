<p>Koin, a company that specializes in making digital payments simpler in the iGaming and gambling industries, has brought on an industry veteran to help steer the company as it continues to expand and scale its commercial operations.</p>
<p>Fittingly, Koin has appointed Scott Carcillo, a Wynn Resorts veteran, as its new Chief Commercial Officer, with Carcillo joining the team and helping the company better adjust its ongoing expansion in the exciting and growing gambling sector.</p>
<p>Carcillo will have two responsibilities as part of the commercial team. He will tailor and adjust the existing strategy, and also ensure that Koin increases its reach in a field that is already getting some serious competition from equally dedicated companies.</p>
<p>Carcillo though has plenty of experience under his belt, and he opened Wynn Resort’s Macau property and oversaw its expansion. He was also in charge of the Las Vegas’ Encore property technological overhaul, and he has won a reputation for an executive who drives innovation and focuses on thinking outside of the box to add value to the companies he serves.</p>
<p>He has worked as CIO at both Wynn Resorts and Merchant Link. Commenting on his appointment, Koin President Gary Larkin said that he was excited to welcome Carcillo as part of Koin’s next chapter of growth.</p>
<p>"His addition is a significant stride in our mission to revolutionize market experiences while expanding our global footprint. This marks the next chapter for Koin, as we continue our pursuit of excellence and innovation in the digital payment sector," Larkin added.</p>
<p>Carcillo is looking to stay in a long-term position with Koin, and the company has similarly confirmed that it would like to see the new CCO stay and guide the company’s growth. Koin isn’t the only company that has been looking to expand into the iGaming sector and make it easier for digital payments.</p>
<p>Sean Mackay from CoinPayments recently spoke with Casino Guru News at the SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 and outlined the future of payments in the iGaming sector and what players and businesses may expect.</p>
<p>His own company has been a torch-bearer for the vertical and is determined to remain in a pole position. In short, though, digital payments, including cryptocurrencies, are bound to be normalized within the iGaming sector, but not overtake more traditional payments.</p>
<p>Yet, innovation in the way payments are transacted continues to galvanize tech-savvy and established businesses, which are ever-keen to get the right technology deployed. Cashless gaming is a hotly-discussed topic in land-based venues and it has been gathering momentum, as one example of how payments in the gambling industry are changing.</p>
