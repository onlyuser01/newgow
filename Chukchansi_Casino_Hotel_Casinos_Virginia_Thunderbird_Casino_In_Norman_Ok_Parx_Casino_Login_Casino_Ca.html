    <h1>Chukchansi Casino Hotel Casinos Virginia Thunderbird Casino In Norman Ok Parx Casino Login Casino Ca</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru,</p>
<p>In continuation of my other claim to CasinoIn , as I mentioned on my previous post , I revert with a more severe claim, since the Casino refused work towards a peaceful resolution of my issue.</p>
<p>You can find the aformentioned claimed on this link:</p>
<p>https://kazinoguru-gr.com/casinoin-o-paictes-pisteuei-oti-e-analepsh-toy-cathysterese-4</p>
<p>As I mentioned on my previous topic , I was self-excluded from the Casino indefinitely and they opened my account not even 5 minutes after I made a reactivation request. By doing so they violated our agreement terms and conditions. Specficially , on responsible gaming sector of terms and conditions it states that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a player wishes to reduce or remove a limit or remove an exclusion, these shall become effective only after the lapse of not less than twenty-four (24) hours from notification to Company’s customer support service. If a player wishes to remove an indefinite exclusion, such change shall only take place 7 days after that player’s request has been received by the Company’s customer support.</li>
</ol>
<p>https://casinoin-gr.com/responsible</p>
<p>Furthermore , since the Casino operates in EU jurisdiction, they have to Comply with GDPR laws, when their consumers are EU citizens.</p>
<p>According to EU jurisdiction laws and specifically the GDPR Art.21 and Art.6</p>
<p>In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>1Where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject should have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. 2That right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on my previous Claim , I notified the Casino SEVERAL times that I objected to receiving their promotions , which they unlawfully did in the first place since I was self excluded to their services.</p>
<hr />
<p>When the Casino sent me all these promotions , I was trying to take a break from gambling and because of their actions , I gambled to their Site and many others , to which I consider the Casino responsible for:</p>
<p>Negligence:The casino was negligent in its handling of the self-exclusion program as specified on the Casinos terms and conditions. Violation of Responsible Gambling Practices: As mentioned in EU and Greek Law , as well as for Companies/Casinos operating in EU. The same practises that everyone involved in this industry approves and follows, including CasinoGuru. Consumer Protection Violation: As aforementioned through GDPR laws for any company operating in EU. Financial Loses: All Financial losses I sustained from gambling on my Break Period due to their promotions. Emotional Distress: Due to Casino's Actions and their promotions , since I relapsed into gambling while on a Break period and having to chase 2 claims because of it.</p>
<p>Considering the aforementioned reasons and based on the extent of the damages incurred, I hereby make a claim for the sum of €10,000.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize that this will be my final communication on this matter before I proceed with taking appropriate actions.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>George</p>
