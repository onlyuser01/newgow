    <h1>South Point Casino Hotel Foxwoods Casino Map Montbleu Resort Casino Isles Casino Best Rated Online C</h1>

<p>Update. I took and bonus a week ago and after meeting the play thru requirements I finally won $1768.91. I received an email from their finance department asking me for documents. I send all they asked for but received a response they were incomplete. I got a bit annoyed so I decided for some reason to play my winnings and luckily won again leaving me a winning balance of $3168.00. I then sent the additional docs they asked for and I received another email stating that they received my docs and it has been put into my account. They also said keep in mind you maybe contacted again for compliance reasons???</p>
<p>WHAT IS THAT???</p>
<p>After 5 days I contacted chat support and asked them about my withdrawal. They said it usually takes 4 days before it goes into the payment process. I also asked if I could deposit and play without hurting my pending withdrawal. They said yes you can deposit and play but with no bonuses. So I did a few times and yesterday I won an additional 500 bringing my total to $3600. Today I received an email from the finance department saying they need a copy of my credit card used for these additional deposits. Even though they had a copy from the previous documents they wanted them again and if I didn't deliver them in 5 days they would void my winnings and put them back into my account. I sent them today</p>
<p>This is the first for me. Hope this doesn't turn into a nightmare for me like some other previous experiences. I will wait 4 more business days with no game play. Let's see what happens.</p>
