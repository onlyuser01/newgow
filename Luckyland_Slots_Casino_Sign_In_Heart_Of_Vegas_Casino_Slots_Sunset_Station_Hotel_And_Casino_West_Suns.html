<p>Ballers Sportsbook has confirmed that it will be introducing Sportradar’s ORAKO solution to help the local sportsbook gain traction</p>
<p>The two companies have entered into a multi-year partnership that will see the ORAKO solution deployed with the Puerto Rico-based sportsbook and help it deliver excellent experiences for players, as the company prepares to roll out its fully-fledged sportsbook product.</p>
<p>Ballers Sportsbook to Get a Strong Start in Puerto Rico</p>
<p>Ballers Sportsbook customers will have access to an extensive library of betting markets secured by Sportradar which will help registered users bet on a number of markets and sports. ORAKO brings along with it the opportunity to place a wager on player props, in-play, futures, teasers, moneylines, parlays, and more.</p>
<p>Ballers is planning to incorporate the ORAKO sportsbook solution with the R. Franco Digital PAM giving the company a full 360-degree omnichannel player experience. Ballers Sportsbook is expected to arrive at some point in the second quarter of the year, with Puerto Rico regulating its sports gambling industry only recently.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Ballers Sportsbook founder Daniel de Ontanon welcomed the opportunity to welcome Sportradar’s solution and implement it with the upcoming online sports betting experience which will deliver on one of the best possible platforms in Puerto Rico over the coming months. De Ontanon said:</p>
<p>We are tremendously pleased and excited to count one of the world’s most prestigious sports betting and gaming platform providers as our partner. Ballers Sportsbook founder Daniel de Ontanon</p>
<p>Excellent Sportsbook Solution with Local Flavor</p>
<p>The executive added that the sportsbook operator was committed to providing a unique and tailored experience to players with a true local flavor. Sportradar managing director managed sportsbook services Jacob Lopez Curciel explained that Puerto Rico is an important part of the Americas and therefore a growth opportunity for the company.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to power Ballers Sportsbook through our ORAKO solution and use the breadth of Sportradar’s technical capabilities to cover the full scale of the sports betting spectrum,” Curciel concluded. The launch of sports betting in Puerto Rico took some time as well.</p>
<p>The activity was officially passed into law in 2019, but the next three years were rife with debate about when the actual rollout of sportsbooks should happen. In the meantime, Sportradar was able to introduce its ORAKO solution in 2022, enabling Ballers Sportsbook to now benefit from it.</p>
