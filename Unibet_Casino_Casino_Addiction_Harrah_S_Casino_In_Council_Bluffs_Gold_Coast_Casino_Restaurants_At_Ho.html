    <h1>Unibet Casino Casino Addiction Harrah S Casino In Council Bluffs Gold Coast Casino Restaurants At Ho</h1>

<p>As per the rules of the League Cup, the winner of the MLS starts its campaign in the first round of the knockout phase. This is why LAFC has played only one game so far. And it was a game to remember – the MLS champ obliterated Mexican side Juarez 7-1.</p>
<p>Can the boys from California do something similar this Tuesday as well? That’s when they’re welcoming Real Salt Lake, a team they have a great record against. LAFC has all wins against Real Salt Lake in their last seven duels in the MLS.</p>

<p>LAFC Eyeing the Leagues Cup Trophy</p>
<p>Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami is seen as the No. 1 favorite to win the trophy, but LAFC isn’t trailing far behind. That’s no surprise as the team from Los Angeles has one of the best rosters in Northern America. These guys might not be as impressive as last season when they completely dominated the Western Conference of the MLS, but they’re doing okay in the domestic league.</p>
<p>In the Leagues Cup, they’re doing even better. Although they’ve played only one game so far, it was a brilliant game. They defeated Juarez 7-1, with striker Denis Bouanga being the standout player. The Gabonese scoring machine found the net three times in that game, while also recording one assist.</p>
<p>Carlos Vela also had a fine game, as well as Kellyn Acosta, Mateusz Bogusz, and Ilie Sanchez. These guys created a lot of chances for LAFC, many of which were turned into goals. What’s kind of worrying for LAFC’s fans is that they didn’t work too hard in the defense, which is why Juarez created a lot of scoring chances as well. Luckily for the LA side, only one of those went in.</p>
<p>Real Salt Lake Has No Other Option but to Fight Back</p>
<p>If they want to advance to the next phase of the Leagues Cup, the men from Utah need to attack. It’s almost certain that LAFC will score a goal on Tuesday, which means that Real Salt Lake players will have to try to do the same.</p>
<p>The good news for them is that they have some excellent players in the attacking department in 2023. The best example is Christian Arango, the former LAFC player who was the highest-scoring player for the MLS champs last year.</p>
<p>Since joining his new club, Arango’s scored three goals (in six games), but Real Salt Lake’s top-scorers in all competitions (MLS, Leagues Cup, and US Open Cup) are currently Jefferson Savarino and Danny Musovski, each with eight goals.</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC vs. Real Salt Lake Prediction</p>
<p>In four of the last five LAFC vs. Salt Lake duels in the MLS, we saw over 2.5 goals happening. We think the same will happen in their first-ever duel in the Leagues Cup. There should be three or more goals at BMO Stadium on Tuesday, with LAFC being the team that scores more.</p>
<p>Pick: LAFC to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
