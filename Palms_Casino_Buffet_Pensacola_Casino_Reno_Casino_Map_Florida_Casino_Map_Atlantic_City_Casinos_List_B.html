<p>The leader in iGaming in the United States has launched its newly-themed and sports-focused hockey slot which enjoys backing from the National Hockey League itself</p>
<p>The new game, NHL Gold Blitz, is right now available at the company’s online casino platform in New Jersey, where BetMGM offers players and fans of the NHL to immerse themselves in what is a gripping and captivating ice ring experience.</p>
<p>New NHL Slot Set to Take the Front Stage at BetMGM New Jersey</p>
<p>The game is developed by Digital Gaming Corporation, which is a prominent local partner to BetMGM, and a developer of innovative content that is fully focused on building products for the regulated online casino sector in the United States and North America.</p>
<p>The new title comes with a 6-row, 4-reel grid along with 4,096 paylines and numerous features that make the entire experience more fun for the end user. Among the games that players can get their hands on are such options as the Instant Cash Collection feature and the Wild Multiplier Free Spins, along with native jackpot rewards.</p>
<p>Apart from relying on a thematic hook for sports and hockey fans, Digital Gaming Corporation and BetMGM have decided to create an experience that stands well on its own and delivers outstanding and fun gameplay across the board.</p>
<p>Much like other sports-themed and backed slots, BetMGM and Digital Gaming Corporation have agreed that the key to hockey fans’ hearts is personalization and offering tailored experiences. This is why players can see all 32 NHL teams and their logos.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, BetMGM VP of Gaming Product &amp; Content Oliver Bartlett said that the company was ecstatic to have embarked on this meaningful collaboration with NHL and Digital Gaming Corporation, adding:</p>
<p>The iconic NHL brand combined with the great action of the game make this a real winner. We are proud to offer this and many more unique games exclusively at BetMGM. BetMGM VP of Gaming Product &amp; Content Oliver Bartlett</p>
<p>DGC B2B iGaming Division CCO Neill Whyte was similarly pleased with the resulting product and its significance for the market. He hailed BetMGM for its forward-thinking approach to iGaming and insisting on building titles, products, and experiences that follow the players and their specific needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Building Upon a Solid Brand IP and Franchise</p>
<p>“A great game, a great brand and a great team,” Whyte said commenting on the launch of NHL Gold Blitz with BetMGM. This is not the first time that BetMGM has used NHL assets and imagery.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company rolled out branded NHL roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and even a live Mone Wheel game – Dream Catcher, to further reinforce the league’s standing within the iGaming sector, which has seen players respond with excitement and pounce at the opportunity to play an NHL-themed game indeed.</p>
<p>Major leagues have been more prominent among casino companies of late, with Aristocrat launching a series of NFL-themed games that resonated with players across the land-based sector.</p>
