    <h1>Casino Nashville Aria Vegas Casino House Of Fun Casino Casino By Niagara Falls Larchwood Iowa Casino</h1>

<p>Push Gaming is continuing to grow its commercial momentum in the Netherlands, one of Europe’s most strictly regulated markets, and a lucrative opportunity for suppliers and operators alike.</p>
<p>The studio and developer of innovative gaming titles have expanded its partnership with Kindred Group and will now feature a new and exclusive title, Crystal Catcher, which will be made available to Kindred’s portfolio only for a specific period of time, the companies shared via a press release.</p>
<p>The new game already adds to other prominent titles by the company, including Giga Jar, Retro Tapes, Big Bamboo, Razor Shark, and Jammin’ Jars offering Dutch players a great variety of options to enjoy when it comes to iGaming content variety.</p>
<p>Push and Kindred Group will offer Crystal Catcher as an exclusive product over the first three months before the game is released to the general network of partners on June 20. While the focus of the two companies' collaboration is the Dutch market, they will similarly seek to introduce Crystal Catcher in other jurisdictions where the companies work together.</p>
<p>The deal will help Push Gaming boost its product visibility with Kindred Group’s global array of brands, with a very strong focus on the regulated iGaming market in the Netherlands. Push is also keen to continue growing its global presence across the board, making sure its products gain further awareness in the coming months.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Director of New Business and Markets Fiona Hickey has welcomed the opportunity to see more of the company’s products launched with Kindred in the Netherlands and across Europe. She called this a significant opportunity and hailed the latest initiative:</p>
<p>Equally noteworthy is our allocation of Crystal Catcher on an exclusive basis which isn’t something we choose to offer lightly; such is the stature of this collaboration. We are thrilled to be evolving our relationship with Kindred.</p>
<p>Kindred Group Head of Casino Gareth Jennings was similarly pleased to see Push Gaming’s high-quality content further integrated with the company’s platform. Jennings welcomed the opportunity for the two companies to further strengthen their collaboration, calling it as a natural progression of their mutual relationship.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Kindred representative was very happy to see Crystal Catcher launch with Kindred Group’s brands exclusively, aiding the company and its brands to maintain their leading operator profile in the Netherlands and beyond.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has in the meantime been building up its presence in the Italian and Belgium iGaming markets.</p>
