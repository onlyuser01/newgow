<p>William Hill’s iGaming subsidiary in Europe, Mr Green, has landed a license to set up shop in Spain. The company already operates a sports betting license in the country.</p>
<p>Mr Green Arrives on the Spanish Market</p>
<p>Mr Green, the gaming subsidiary of William Hill in Europe, has added a new market to its portfolio, securing a license from the Directorate General for the Regulation of Gambling (DGOJ), Spain’s gambling watchdog.</p>
<p>Even though Spain has experienced fairly restrictive changes in policy insofar gambling is concerned, Mr Green has decisively pushed for a new license, not least because of soaring gaming and sports betting results in Q2 despite the pandemic. Gambling advertising in the country actually went up 10.6% in 2019, posting a double-digit growth.</p>
<p>More importantly, a study by the University Carlos III of Madrid suggested that only 0.3% of all participants in gambling activities experience problem gambling.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Spain has changed tact in how it treats and handles gambling in the country, and has vowed to tackle gambling harm.</p>
<p>The regulatory climate has been changing quickly, with the country deciding to suspend online gambling advertisement, which has not stopped Betway, a rival to Mr Green and William Hill, to cement its position in the country and expand further.</p>
<p>Thanks to Spain, William hill will consolidate its presence not only in Spain, but also enrich its multi-brand portfolio across the entire continent.</p>
<p>Listed on the London Stock Exchange, William Hill has been available in Spain since 2010 via WilliamHill.es, a sports betting handle, and now the company is expanding into iGaming via its subsidiary. The move constitutes an exciting opportunity says Patrick Jonker, William Hill International Managing Director and Mr Green CEO.</p>
<p>According to Jonker, the launch of Mr Green in Spain is an important stepping stone and a chance to move forward for William Hill. Jonker noted that William Hill already has a strong presence in the sports betting market in the country, and now has the opportunity to join forces with Mr Green as one of the most successful casino brands.</p>
<p>“With the combination of two industry leading brands, we look forward to delivering the best player experience within Sports and Gaming.” -William Hill International Managing Director Patrick Jonker</p>
<p>Mr Green has only recently changed hands as it was previously operated by MRG Group, but was transferred to William Hill back in 2019 for the sum total of €270 million. In previous news, Mr Green was fined £3 million by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) for “systemic failings to address measures related to preventing money laundering.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, William Hill has accepted Caesars £2.9 billion takeover bid and 888 has expressed interest in William Hill’s international assets. At the same time, Spain’s Q2 iGaming revenue increased year-over-year (YOY).</p>
