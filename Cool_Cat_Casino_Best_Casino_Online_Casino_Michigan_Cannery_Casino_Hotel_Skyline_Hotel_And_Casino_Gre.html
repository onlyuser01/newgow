    <h1>Cool Cat Casino Best Casino Online Casino Michigan Cannery Casino Hotel Skyline Hotel And Casino Gre</h1>

<p>Greentube continues to expand its content footprint. As the interactive gaming division for Novomatic, the company is definitely in a strong position to do so, as more gambling companies are putting a greater emphasis on digital acquisitions and expansion in the interactive gaming sector. Even PokerStars, a brand traditionally known for its card games, is now beefing up its igaming content.</p>
<p>PokerStars Adds Greentube Games in Italy</p>
<p>As a result, Greentube’s products will be available across PokerStars’ European domains and provide a variety of unique games that have become player favorites. PokerStars is planning to launch in Denmark, Spain, Greece, the United Kingdom, and Romania. The company is currently covering the Italian market where Greentube’s titles will later launch.</p>
<p>Those titles include popular choices such as Book of Ra, Lucky Lady’s Charm, and Dolphin’s Pearl. This partnership is an important milestone for the company which is looking to continually expand its reach in new markets and with big new names. Greentube wants to achieve a status as a premium content supplier which creates real value for brands across Europe and their consumers.</p>
<p>This is precisely why PokerStars is a great choice for a partner. PokerStars is also working on an international scale which will serve as a trampoline for future Greentube market reaches. PokerStars is available across North America and Europe, along with Latin American reach, which is where Greentube is currently undergoing rapid expansions.</p>
<p>Bigger Reach and Pull for Both Companies</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Greentube UK commercial director David Bolas said that he was thrilled to see PokerStars as one of the company’s latest partners. PokerStars is a brand that sets the standards high in the igaming industry, he explained.</p>
<p>Its success in resonating with players across multiple markets enables us to significantly increase the reach of our content, initially in Italy before hitting other territories across Europe. I believe this is only the start of what will be a long and mutually successful partnership. Greentube UK commercial director David Bolas</p>
<p>Greentube’s foothold in Italy is expanding as the company previously acquired Admiral Sport and it seeks to further consolidate its strength in various European markets.</p>
