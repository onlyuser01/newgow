<p>According to BoyleSports’ retail machine manager, its new shop in Stevenage will be the best gambling location in the area</p>
<p>BoyleSports, an Irish gambling company, has unveiled a new shop in the United Kingdom. The bookmaker’s new location is in Stevenage Old Town, allowing locals to play many exciting gambling games.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by Dan Robinson, BoyleSports’ retail machine manager, who was excited about the opening. The manager used the opportunity to highlight the quality gaming experiences that the shop will offer.</p>
<p>This time we are enhancing the town center in Stevenage Old Town with the BoyleSports brand, industry-leading offers, and state-of-the-art customer facilities – another superb shop fit from all involved and a big round of applause to you all. Dan Robinson, retail machine manager, BoyleSports</p>
<p>The exact address of BoyleSports’ latest location in the United Kingdom is 67-69 High Street, Stevenage, SG1 3AG.</p>
<p>Robinsons Says This Will Be the Best Gambling Shop Around</p>
<p>Robinson invited everyone in the local area to visit the shop and try out what BoyleSports has to offer. He specified that the new location is certainly the best betting shop in the local area.</p>
<p>Robinson also published photos of the new location, showcasing the facility. A wall of screens will allow sports bettors to keep track of all the big leagues, making sure not to miss an important bet. A row of gambling machines makes sure that customers have enough diversity to remain engaged at all times.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Racing Post corner where visitors can read the latest issue of the famous British daily horse racing, greyhound racing and sports betting newspaper.</p>
<p>Robinson concluded that fans should stay tuned for further news. He teased that BoyleSports has big plans for the UK and plans to open more new shops in the country.</p>
<p>BoyleSports Continues to Grow Its Presence and Content Library</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BoyleSports penned a UK and Ireland-facing slot distribution deal with Yggdrasil. Under the deal, the operator, which operates over 25 shops in Britain, was able to offer more varied content to its consumers.</p>
<p>In February, BoyleSports also signed an agreement with Pariplay, becoming a partner of its Fusion platform. As a result, the gambling operator was able to onboard content from Wizard Games.</p>
<p>Last year, BoyleSports was forced to spend months without a leader, following the exit of Mark Kemp, who left after less than a year with the company. In December 2022, BoyleSports finally found a suitable replacement, welcoming the experienced Vlad Kaltenieks as the new company leader.</p>
