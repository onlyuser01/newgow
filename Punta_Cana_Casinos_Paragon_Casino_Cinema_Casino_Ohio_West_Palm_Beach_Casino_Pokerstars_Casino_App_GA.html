<p>The British gambling self-exclusion service, GAMSTOP, announced the launch of a new initiative that seeks to raise awareness of self-exclusion.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP Introduces New Self-Exclusion Awareness Campaign</p>
<p>The new campaign was launched on Thursday, September 15, via Twitter and reached an overall audience of 2.6 million people. The initiative, called #TakeBackControl2022 Day marks the first self-exclusion awareness campaign launched in the UK. To complete the initiative, GAMSTOP joined forces with leading sports organizations and professional soccer clubs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are very grateful to all our partners who took part with us on social media to support the campaign, using the #TakeBackControl2022 hashtag.‚Äú Fiona Palmer, CEO at GAMSTOP</p>
<p>Fiona Palmer, GAMSTOP‚Äôs CEO, thanked all of the partners and organizations that supported the initiative via social media channels. She explained that the #TakeBackControl2022 Day campaign helped GAMSTOP connect with new audiences. In conclusion, Palmer acknowledged that the campaign helped promote self-exclusion and granted users invaluable information on how to get help if they need it.</p>
<p>ü§ù Today we're working with @gamstopuk1 to highlight the benefits of gambling self-exclusion.</p>
<p>More than 300,000 people have already registered with the free GAMSTOP service to take back control of their online gambling.</p>

<p>The Number of Self-Excluded Users Grows</p>
<p>Professional soccer clubs such as Crystal Palace supported the recent initiative. The self-exclusion awareness campaign was also supported by the Professional Players Federation, the Professional Cricket Association, QPR and PDPA. Preston North End, Southend, AFC Mansfield, Luton Town, Walsall FC, Sutton United, Oldham Athletic, Swindon Town FC and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge also supported GAMSTOP‚Äôs recent campaign.</p>
<p>Since the launch of GAMSTOP, more than 315,000 people have registered for its services, self-excluding themselves from all gambling operators that are licensed in the UK. The free national online self-exclusion service is aware that major sporting events can result in a rise in new registrations. Still, raising awareness of the possibility to self-exclude and providing help for those affected by gambling harm remains a key priority for GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, GAMSTOP revealed it surpassed the major milestone of having 300,000 registered customers in the UK. The number of registered users between January and June this year hit 43,500. This marked a year-over-year increase of 9% when compared to the same period in 2021.</p>
