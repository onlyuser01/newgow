<p>Considering the aforementioned information, we are committed to assisting you in reprocessing your withdrawals. However, it is essential for you to provide us with a bank account that can accept the funds. This particular aspect is beyond our control and relies on your cooperation to furnish the necessary details.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is crucial to note that the Croatian market has been closed, and we have taken the necessary steps to restrict access from this geographical location across all our brands. We are fully aware of this regulatory change and have implemented measures accordingly.</p>
<p>Firstly, our terms and conditions clearly state that we may not always process withdrawals back to the same method used for deposits, as mentioned in the previous posts. This is in line with our policies and procedures and clearly defined in our brands terms and is the industry standard.</p>
<p>Once again, we apologize for any confusion caused by our previous response and any inconvenience you may have experienced. We appreciate your feedback and will take it into consideration as we continuously evaluate and enhance our services.</p>
<p>Regarding your statement that you have successfully used Skrill with other casinos in Croatia, we appreciate your feedback. However, each casino operates independently and has its own policies and partnerships with payment service providers. While Skrill may be available on other platforms, it does not necessarily mean that it will be offered on ours.</p>
<p>We understand your frustration and would like to clarify the situation. While Skrill may be licensed and operational in Croatia, our decision to not offer Skrill as a payment option is due to internal banking regulations specific to our platform. These regulations are in place to ensure compliance with various financial laws and regulations, including those related to money transfers and anti-money laundering measures.</p>
<p>Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding Skrill availability in your region. We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused by our previous response.</p>
