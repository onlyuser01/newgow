<p>Crystal Clans review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>If the slot machine industry has mastered just one thing, then it must be how to evoke the marketing of other products in just the right way to capture interest without crossing the IP lawyers. So here we have Crystal Clans, because "Clash of Clans" is one of the most popular mobile phone games and "crystal" are top of everyone’s slot name bingo cards.</p>
<p>The clans in question are the various post-Tolkien races: humans, elves, dwarves and Wizards. There is a princess and king and the style is the sort of blocky cartoon style that grew out of the original Warcraft games.</p>
<p>It’s an excellent piece of pastiche but it is undoubtedly pastiche none the less.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>And it is excellent. The style of the symbols is evocative and characterful, they have easily identifiable silhouettes that work on any device from mobile to smart TV and the animations are clean and bright.</p>
<p>The music does a great job of sounding just Enya-ish to trigger a Lord of the Rings fan and although the reel and win sounds are a little underplayed it is better that, than there be a clash of bands.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is a pretty standard five by three slot machine with fifty win lines.</p>
<p>This is given a little spice by Wild Multipliers and a Free Spin bonus (full details below), but all this feels like a token gesture, given the sparks of ingenuity that other iSoftBet games sometimes show.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and on reel five will sometimes come with a two, three, five or ten times multiplier.</p>
<p>There is also a Scatter symbol that will trigger the free spin bonus if you hit two or more on consecutive reels starting from reel one. This is a contrast from most Scatters which will normally pay out from anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>Two scatters will award you a minimum of ten free spins, while five will award you 35-50 free spins. Hitting a multiplier on the same spin will multiply your free spins by that amount. Spins cannot be retriggered, but hitting two Scatters in a free spin will double your current number of free spins, three will triple it, and four or five will multiply your remaining spins by five and ten respectively.</p>
<p>There is a maximum of 100 free spins each time the Free Spin Bonus is triggered.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.22%. Substantially under our yardstick of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was $/£/€0.50 to $/£/€500.00, which is not great for low rollers but covers everyone else.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, making it hard to recommend especially given the RTP.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While Crystal Clans is a good looking slot with a lot of obvious production value, it is severely lacking in the gameplay department.</p>
<p>The RTP of 95.22% does little to make up for this, and the volatility would only be tolerable if everything else came together for the slot</p>
<p>Overall, we cannot recommend this slot to our readers.</p>
