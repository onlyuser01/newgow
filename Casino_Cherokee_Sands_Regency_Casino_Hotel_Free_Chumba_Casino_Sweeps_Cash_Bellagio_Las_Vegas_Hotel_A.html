<p>BGO Entertainment is experiencing massive problems as the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) has decided to suspend its license. The regulator determined that the gaming company is not capable of carrying all of the licensed activities. The UKGC released a statement in which it says that, in accordance with the Gambling Act of 2005, Section 116, BGO, based in Gibraltar, is under a licensing review to determine whether it can maintain the standards set by the regulator.</p>
<p>Section 118 (2) of the Gambling Act 2005 Authorized the Immediate Suspension</p>
<p>Thanks to Section 118 (2) of the Gambling Act 2005, UKGC’s immediate license suspension has been authorized. According to this section, the UKGC can suspend a license if it comes to the conclusion that the activities conducted by the licensee are not in accordance and are inconsistent with the objective that the license sets.</p>
<p>UKGC’s statement says that after concerns that some activities may have been conducted in ways that are contrary to gaming regulations, it has been deemed that the operator may not be suitable to carry on the activities set by the license itself. As a result, a consequent suspension and a review will follow.</p>
<p>This is not the first time BGO has had problems with its UKGC license. Considering the fact that BGO was deemed to have massive AML controls and customer care failures, the operator was among the sites that faced new restrictions by the regulatory body last fall. These failures were recorded between September 2018 and March 2020.</p>
<p>Specifically, the UKGC explained in its statement, “The review and consequent suspension follow concerns that activities may have been carried out contrary to the Act, not in accordance with conditions of their licence and that the Licensee may be unsuitable to carry on the licensed activities. Failing to protect consumers was a key consideration in the suspension decision.”</p>
<p>As a result, BGO had to pay over $2.7 million (£2 million) in a settlement. Moreover, it had to perform “enhanced due diligence checks” to its 250 most loyal customers as it was a compliance regulation of the Money Laundering Regulations of 2017 by the UK.</p>
<p>No Further Details Were Revealed on the License Suspension</p>
<p>Apart from stating that BGO must keep its customers informed of the latest developments, including the recent suspension and all future events that may impact them, the UKGC hasn’t provided any further details on the immediate license suspension of the operator.</p>
<p>BGO did follow this protocol and issued a statement on the following websites: powerspins.com, Bgo.com, chilli.com and vegasluck.com. The statement informed players that the operator is currently working with the regulator to try to resolve the issues. In the meantime, deposits on the platforms are not allowed, but players are free to withdraw their funds from their accounts.</p>
