<p>Coral Racing Club has surpassed 50,000 members in three months since its creation, the club announced on Twitter</p>
<p>Coral Racing Club, a free-to-join racecourse ownership club for horse racing enthusiasts, has announced that it has surpassed 50,000 in just three months after its creation. The club proudly shared this exciting announcement on Twitter.</p>
<p>50,000 Members &amp; Counting</p>
<p>The club has been quickly expanding ever since its creation in November 2022. As announced by Coral Racing Club, it now boasts a whopping 50,000 members and counting. The club’s simple concept has resonated with fans of racing, attracting many new users. The free-to-play aspect has further helped to sell the concept to the numerous horseracing fans across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Amid this exciting announcement, Coral Racing Club promised to continue with the Owner for the Day experiences and exclusive racing events. The company vowed to keep fans closer to the action throughout 2023.</p>
<p>As reported by Gambling Insider, Simon Clare, Coral’s PR director, commented on the announcement. He said that when his team launched the racing club, their primary objectives were to popularize horse racing among the customers of the Coral betting brand. As attested by the huge following the club now has, Clare and his associates have certainly achieved their goal.</p>
<p>Coral Racing Club Provides Premium Experiences to Racing Fans</p>
<p>Through Coral Racing Club, racing enthusiasts can experience a variety of racing-related experiences. Users can become the owners of a racehorse for an event. Before a Coral Racing Club racehorse enters an event, members vote on who the 10 owners will be. Most notably, temporary owners can win prize money if their horse wins an event.</p>
<p>Owners can also visit their horses at the stable and talk with the club’s professional trainers about the animals’ progress. Racing fans can learn more about the races in which the horse will participate and follow its journey.</p>
<p>In addition to the many behind-the-scenes opportunities and seeing everything that goes into training racehorses, club members have the chance to win free raceday tickets for a variety of events and may have their raceday hospitality costs covered.</p>
<p>Coral Racing Club is a venture of the Entain-owned sports betting brand Coral, which is famous for the exciting wagering opportunities it offers to customers. In November, for example, the company brought additional value to its players by introducing Bet Bundles, a set of five bets at a discounted price. This offering was released just before the FIFA World Cup and represented the company’s way of capitalizing on the exciting soccer event.</p>
