<p>You are in safe hands We guarantee that all sites listed on GamblingNews.com are safe, legitimate, and secure operators that will help bring out the best possible iGaming experience. We will never knowingly promote unlicensed or blacklisted websites that operate against jurisdictional laws. Each brand we review is always manually co-verified by an online gambling expert. Legal and regulated</p>

<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>FanDuel used to be a grey operator in the United States. Yet, in 2018 the Supreme Court struck down a federal prohibition on sports betting known as PASPA and paved the way for regulated wagering on sporting contests. FanDuel did not hesitate and on September 1, 2018, the sportsbook launched in New Jersey, followed by more launches in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana, and Illinois among others.</p>
<p>Today, FanDuel Sportsbook is also available and offering real money gambling markets in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Tennessee, and Virginia, with more launches coming down the pipeline. You can access FanDuel’s dedicated sports betting experience via the sportsbook’s dedicated iOS and Android app in almost every state where it has sportsbooks available.</p>
<p>In this FanDuel Sportsbook review, we will discuss all there is to know about FanDuel and the numerous offers the company holds. We have tested the mobile selection at some length and are happy with our findings. In addition, our team has made sure to test FanDuel in every available state to get the best impression of the user experience and available promotions. Here’s what we found out.</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>To get you started first you have the FanDuel welcome bonus, which is a massive $1,000 risk-free bet. The premise of the bonus offer is very simple. If you lose any amount up to $1,000, you will be repaid and get a chance to re-wager the money instead.</p>
<p>This offer only applies to your first bet, so you can only expect the potential loss on your first bet to be covered under the bonus. We find this to be a generous way to start at the sportsbook and a good way to test a few of the markets.</p>
<p>The risk-free bet makes it possible to take your money to a sports betting market that offers a higher yield, even if the odds are a little slimmer. A savvy sports bettor can use the FanDuel Sportsbook bonus to make the right bet at the right time and benefit from a decent payday. Mind, though, that there are terms and conditions that do apply.</p>
<p>Then again, some argue that having a 100% match bonus like most other sportsbooks is actually a better way to go. That really depends. A 100% match welcome bonus certainly sounds tempting, but those offers usually come with rather stiff terms and conditions attached to them, and you usually have to bet over the same amount of money over and over to unlock the winnings.</p>
<p>Not every sports fan finds this type of bonus fitting to their playstyle and the risk-free offer is often a preferred option, which plays right into FanDuel Sportsbook’s own strengths.</p>
<p>More Sports Betting Offers with FanDuel</p>
<p>FanDuel offers a massive selection of promotions designed to support you as a sports bettor. Apart from the risk-free bet, you can benefit from numerous other rewarding sessions that will make sure you, even if you are venturing well out of your comfort zone, you still have a fallback solution a bonus can provide you with.</p>
<p>The website offers a variety of odds boosters while using various Parlay Insurance promotions to invite every user to take a chance on their favorite sport. We find this approach to promotions fitting and definitely a good way to provide you with a better overall sports betting experience.</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook has numerous promotions such as First Period Insurance for the NHL, as well as College Basketball Parlay Insurance for NCAAB. Other excellent offers include the NHL and Soccer Parlay Insurances and the NBA 3-Point Challenge.</p>
<p>Most of the promos are created as sort of sports betting contests, which always offer some way to safeguard your bets against potential failure. We enjoy the way FanDuel takes care of your real money wagers and gives you a safety net to make sports betting even more enjoyable overall.</p>
<p>All of these bets are available on the mobile app as well as the desktop, and you will remain constantly updated about the latest bonus treats available at FanDuel. You don’t have to use a FanDuel promo code to activate any of the bonuses either. If such is needed, it will be listed in the offer’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Where Is FanDuel Sportsbook Available?</p>
<p>FanDuel has been rapidly expanding its footprint across the United States. Since it’s launched in New Jersey in 2018 it has increased its presence in 10 other states as of January 2021, and we are sure it will add more states moving forward. In fact, there isn’t any doubt about that.</p>
<p>The sportsbook’s offer doesn’t really vary from one state to the next but, just to be sure, we made sure to check. You can use the same account as long as you are accessing the sportsbook from a regulated state. Bar a few small differences, the core offer remains unchanged, providing you with a quality sports betting experience.</p>
<p>FanDuel New Jersey</p>
<p>Available on : Mobile and retail</p>
<p>: Mobile and retail Land-based partner: Meadowlands Racetrack</p>
<p>New Jersey welcomed FanDuel Sportsbook first in September 2018, giving a flying start to the fantasy sports platform in mainstream sports betting contests. New Jersey has some specifics, and it has a liberalized betting market, which allows you to bet on the Oscars. Then again, you may not bet on in-state college teams. The FanDuel mobile app is available in the Garden State for both Android and iOS, making for easy access overall. Meanwhile, FanDuel is also looking into adding a second retail sportsbook in Atlantic City in 2021.</p>
<p>FanDuel Michigan</p>
<p>Available on : Mobile and retail</p>
<p>: Mobile and retail Land-based partner: MotorCity Casino</p>
<p>FanDuel’s Michigan entry was one of the first for 2021, and an important milestone nonetheless. With the state focusing on mobile licenses first, this played right into FanDuel Sportsbook’s strengths to provide betting solutions remotely, focusing on both traditional sports and fantasy contests.</p>
<p>FanDuel West Virginia</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and mobile Land-based partner: Greenbrier Resort</p>
<p>West Virginia proved a very accommodating state for FanDuel as well. The sportsbook went live in August 2019 and has been a permanent member of the betting landscape in the state. WV was this close to becoming the first place in the United States that authorized betting on politics.</p>
<p>In fact, FanDuel briefly launched the markets but was ordered to close all of it shortly after with the WV Lottery stepping in to stop the activity, as apparently, the sportsbook has misread a confirmation that it could go ahead with the vertical.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a let-down for many, as the 46th U.S. Presidential election was one of the biggest. Nevertheless, there are tons of betting options for you if you go with FanDuel in West Virginia, and you can bet from mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>FanDuel Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and mobile Land-based partner: Valley Forge Casino Resort</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the biggest states where sports betting is permitted. Naturally, FanDuel Sportsbook has been one of the earliest entrants and this is a good thing, too. The company has partnered with the Valley Forge Casino for a land-based sportsbook and things have been going extremely well.</p>
<p>The sportsbook is jam-packed with all sorts of cool promotional offers that will make the busiest sports betting seasons a blast. Not least, you can claim the $1,000 risk-free wager for a warm welcome.</p>
<p>FanDuel Illinois</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and Mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and Mobile Land-based partner: Par-A-Dice Casino</p>
<p>Illinois recently stripped down its mandatory in-person registration condition, which is a huge help for anyone looking to participate in sports betting activities. As a result, the sportsbook is now available to mobile and retail customers who are looking to have a good time betting on sports. Both fantasy sports as well as professional and college options are available and players can bet on fantasy contests but also on Super Bowl, the NBA finals, Stanley Cup, and more.</p>
<p>FanDuel Indiana</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and mobile Land-based partner: Blue Chip Casino, Belterra Casino</p>
<p>FanDuel launched its mobile sports betting offer in Indiana in October 2019 , making an ambitious entry into the state and holding a strong sway with the local sports fan base. The sportsbook has been ticking neatly over the years, and its offer aligns with the rest of the states, bringing competitive odds, markets, and betting variety.</p>
<p>FanDuel Iowa</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and mobile Land-based partner: Diamond Jo Worth, Diamond Jo Dubuque</p>
<p>FanDuel was one of the first to actually launch mobile sports betting in Iowa . The sportsbook beat many competitors to the punch, with other sportsbooks a little skittish because of the in-person registration rule which was amended at the turn of 2021. Today, players can register online, but FanDuel Sportsbook has had enough time to establish itself as a market leader.</p>
<p>FanDuel Colorado</p>
<p>Available on : Retail and mobile</p>
<p>: Retail and mobile Land-based partner: Twin River Worldwide Holdings</p>
<p>Colorado has been a good state so far for FanDuel, with the site ticking over nicely and attracting a fair bit of action from local players. From traditional sports to fantasy football, bettors have been able to benefit from the vast offer provided by the operator in the Centennial State. The site will start you with a good $1,000 risk-free bet to help you get to a flying start in the state.</p>
<p>FanDuel Tennessee</p>
<p>Available on : Mobile</p>
<p>: Mobile Land-based partner: N/A</p>
<p>Tennessee is definitely a fantastic place for FanDuel to be. The state focuses on mobile and online wagering over any retail venues, making it a unique place in the United States. More importantly, FanDuel is perfectly capable of delivering a fully mobile-focused experience, giving it an edge over other stakeholders. The options to bet on in the state are numerous, allowing players to enjoy placing a bet on mainstream competitions, including NFL, NBA, NCAAB, NCAAF, and many others.</p>
<p>FanDuel Virginia</p>
<p>Available on : Mobile</p>
<p>: Mobile Land-based partner: N/A</p>
<p>Guess what? FanDuel Sportsbook is also available in Virginia! The sportsbook launched on time for the Super Bowl, introducing bettors to a tailored $225 special bet on the big NFL game. In any event, FanDuel has been able to adjust and evolve its offer in Virginia to play to the tastes of local players and give them many great bets, and better yet, well-adjusted odds across the board. FanDuel was actually the first brand allowed , thanks to its partnership with the Washington Football Team.</p>
<p>FanDuel New York</p>
<p>Available on : Retail</p>
<p>: Retail Land-based partner: Tioga Downs</p>
<p>FanDuel is available in New York through its retail partnership with Tioga Downs. While the state’s governor is hotly-debating the introduction of mobile sports betting, it seems the Empire State wants to run any type of remote gambling through a state-controlled entry. Nevertheless, FanDuel is still up and running in the state and happy to provide retail bettors with plenty of worthwhile options.</p>
<p>FanDuel Mississippi</p>
<p>Available on : Retail</p>
<p>: Retail Land-based partner: IP Biloxi, Sam’s Town Tunica</p>
<p>So far, Mississippi is focusing on its retail sports betting segment, something that may change before long. In the meantime, though, FanDuel has had a fruitful partnership with Boyd Gaming and the retail sportsbooks in the state, to name IP Biloxi and Sam’s Town Tunica.</p>
<p>FanDuel Massachusetts</p>
<p>Available on : Mobile (horse racing)</p>
<p>: Mobile (horse racing) Land-based partner: Suffolk Downs</p>
<p>FanDuel is bidding its time in Massachusetts where it received approval by the state’s Gaming Commission to offer pari-mutuel betting online for horse racing and in collaboration with Suffolk Downs.</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook Mobile App</p>
<p>To bring you the comfort you deserve, every FanDuel Sportsbook will come with a dedicated mobile app that works well on the majority of devices out there, and specifically on popular operating systems such as Android and iOS. For starters, the app is quite accessible.</p>
<p>It conveniently packs all sports betting markets and fantasy betting options, has a quick and intuitive way to go through the available odds, and looks at what bets you can place. The user interface is optimized to work from any device regardless of resolution. You will be able to access your account from any device, too, making for a simple overall experience. You get various incentives to use the mobile app, too. Downloading the solution is free and so is setting you your account.</p>
<p>The overall responsiveness of the solution is quite neat and if anything the betslip behaves great and you can deposit and withdraw without any delays. We believe FanDuel’s mobile apps is one of the best betting options, bringing high flexibility and functionality. You can further adjust the layout to display any sport you prefer or focus on a single game instead if you choose to. The native mobile site makes for a fun overall online wagering experience with the app.</p>
<p>Great Odds and Competitive Markets</p>
<p>FanDuel does have some competitive odds and numerous sports markets to offer you! You will find yourself picking from top-notch selections that may be new to you, but the offers are solid all the same. Presently, FanDuel features 18 major sports, including NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MMA, Darts, NASCAR, Rugby, Australian Rules, College Football, College Basketball, and naturally, a bunch of daily fantasy sports contests!</p>
<p>There are more sports, including golf, soccer, tennis, MMA, and boxing to name a few. Overall, FanDuel’s sportsbook offer is pretty solid and it makes it easy for a player to check the sport they enjoy the most. It’s super easy to click through the available markets and pick those that feel like the best fit for you.</p>
<p>The website’s responsive user interface means that you will be able to quickly browse through the available offer and wager on those outcomes you find most reliable. A single contest can run basic odds such as Spread, Moneyline, and Total. Then again, you have quite a few other possible options.</p>
<p>A number of opportunities exist with “Win Margin,” “Winning Margin Bands,” “Player Performance Doubles,” “To Record a Triple Double” and many similar markets. They are all there to give the user a slightly more customized experience that allows you to approach your favorite sports from a different angle.</p>
<p>You will notice that there are many parlays and teasers, and this is one of FanDuel’s staple offers. Whether you play in New Jersey or Pennsylvania, your account will grant you access to some top-notch markets.</p>
<p>Prop Bets, a FanDuel Special</p>
<p>Just like the website has tons of insurances as promotions, FanDuel’s other specialty lies in providing players with numerous prop bets. Prop bets are special featured selections that ask users to guess specific outcomes of a game, whether that is a bet on a team or a player.</p>
<p>Props have some of the highest yields in terms of actual return, but then again, they expect you to guess wagering conditions that are much more difficult than the traditional moneyline markets for example. Even then, we are happy with the numerous props FanDuel features for many of the sports it covers, and we definitely hold this to be one of the sportsbook’s strengths.</p>
<p>In-Play Markets at FanDuel</p>
<p>FanDuel’s sports coverage is more than decent – it’s leading the way in which sportsbooks should present gambling content, and this is definitely a point in its favor. Now, FanDuel is not just focused on delivering in-play markets, better known as live wagering. It offers live streaming as well, allowing you to immerse yourself in the sports action.</p>
<p>The live markets are always easily accessible. Once again, the layout is beautifully done to allow players to bet on their preferred sport without any hassle. Apart from wagering on live events, though, you have the option to Watch Live.</p>
<p>FanDuel has teamed up with Sportradar and IMG Arena to ensure that it’s delivering superb live streaming content directly from the source. The number of sports available is slowly changing, too, with more live streaming options added every day.</p>
<p>Cash Out Your Bets</p>
<p>If you are looking to make the most of your experience, you would probably want to check the cash out option. This function allows you to assume more control over your in-play sessions. Effectively, the feature will let you withdraw bets you have already placed and recall them or a portion of your bet in mid-game.</p>
<p>The cash out feature is available at the consideration of the sportsbook, so you can’t exactly recall every bet you are feeling doubtful about. The good news is that cash outs are available often enough and a savvy bettor will definitely see the upsides of using this option.</p>
<p>FanDuel Banking Options</p>
<p>The upsides of being one of the best legal sportsbooks in the U.S. are easy to see with the naked eye. One such is how your real money deposits and winnings are sorted out. FanDuel has a solid number of banking methods that all guarantee quick transactions of cash and winnings.</p>
<p>You won’t ever need to double-check if your cash has been processed out because this is always definitely the case. In terms of available banking methods, there are quite a few, including Online Bank Transfer, PayPal, Check, ACH, PayNearMe, Wire Transfer, and Visa and MasterCard.</p>
<p>There is also a dedicated FanDuel prepaid card if you want to bolster your safety a little further. Deposits are instant and for your online transactions, you will hardly ever wait longer than 24 hours as the casino verifies everything it needs prior to clearing a transaction.</p>
<p>Since FanDuel is a legal sportsbook, you will have to make sure that you have submitted all relevant information at registration. KYC and AML are important parts of the experience and you must comply with the required information to be able to cash out your winnings.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of users choose to stick with PayPal as it’s the most intuitive and dependable payment option for many. Our review, though, has shown that you can trust any of the payment options listed, with the only difference being if they are actually your preferred method.</p>
<p>FanDuel’s support page is quite neat and helpful. You can sort through various issues quickly and reliably and find help for a number of potential issues. This includes accounts, deposits &amp; withdrawals, promotions, and more. If the automated section doesn’t help you, you would do well to submit a ticket with FanDuel which is quite easy.</p>
<p>All you need to do is fill out the form with a subject line, a description of your issue, choose a category, and the state in which the problem occurred. Before long, FanDuel’s support will be with you to help you sort out the problem.</p>
<p>Daily Fantasy Sports</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports are a huge part of the FanDuel offer. The offer is great and it allows you to join a dynamic type of contests that might appeal a little more than conventional sports. You get to choose a new team every week and join free or paid games to compete for cash payouts. Plus, unlike traditional sports, FanDuel fantasy sports are now available in 44 states! Plus, the app supports them in full and whether you want to bet on fantasy football or college sports, you have the option to do so!</p>
<p>Is FanDuel a Legal Sportsbook?</p>
<p>There is no doubt about the status of FanDuel as a licensed operator in the United States. While the company did operate as a grey market platform for daily fantasy sports in the past, it has completely focused its efforts on regulated markets since. Fantasy sports are still an undefined matter in some states, and FanDuel Sportsbook is happy to take advantage of that. However, in its entirety, FanDuel is a legal and trusted sportsbook.</p>
<p>The website bears the seal of approval of all regulators in every separate state it’s currently present in and offers professional sports betting markets. The website is SSL encrypted and audited by every regulator for license violations or harmful practices. None of this has been the case in the many years of FanDuel’s operations!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>FanDuel remains one of the best options when it comes to sports betting options in the United States. The company’s growing presence in the country allows it to connect with millions of sports fans around the U.S. and in places where traditional sports are still unavailable.</p>
<p>FanDuel has been able to achieve a lot, offering superb website and app functionality and building an overall offer that allows placing quick wagers on your favorite sports. The available odds, live streams, and bet types all add up to a reliable and trustworthy offer that makes your next bet satisfying</p>
