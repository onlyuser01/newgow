<p>Worst and First: Jacksonville Jaguars Favored to Earn No. 1 NFL Draft Pick</p>

<p>Little was expected from the Jacksonville Jaguars this season. Now, even less is expected of them after moving on from two of their better players.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Jacksonville traded defensive end Yannick Ngakoue to Minnesota. On Monday morning, it released running back Leonard Fournette.</p>
<p>Over the past four seasons, Ngakoue is one of only four defenders with 35-plus sacks and more than 10 forced fumbles. Fournette is coming off the best season of his career with 1,152 rushing yards and 76 receptions.</p>
<p>On a team already bereft of expectations, the Jaguars are now the heavy favorite to earn the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft.</p>
<p>Low Expectations</p>
<p>The Jaguars are the runaway leader at FanDuel Sportsbook for the worst record in the NFL. They’re +210, far ahead of Washington at +600 and Carolina and Cincinnati at +700.</p>
<p>The market doesn’t really attract a ton of interest,” John Sheeran, the director of trading for FanDuel, told Casino.org. “We reformed the market this morning off the back of the trades to +210 from +250. The trades themselves don’t warrant a huge change in their expected wins. But I think it gives us insight to the franchise’s strategy for the year.”</p>
<p>Since reaching the AFC Championship Game and almost knocking off the mighty Patriots to reach the Super Bowl in 2017, the Jaguars are 11-21, with a pair of last-place finishes in the AFC South.</p>
<p>Now, it appears, they’ve gone from bad to worse. At BetMGM, the Jaguars went from +550 to finish with the most losses in the NFL, to +400. That got them past the rebuilding Washington Football Team, which is +450.</p>
<p>Losing for Lawrence?</p>
<p>Having given up on Blake Bortles, the No. 3 pick of the 2014 draft, and Nick Foles, who signed a four-year, $88 million contract in free agency last off-season, the Jaguars badly need a quarterback. By getting rid of two top players, they have positioned themselves nicely in the sweepstakes to draft quarterback Trevor Lawrence.</p>
<p>The Clemson standout, who pleaded with university leaders to save the 2020 college football season, is the heavy favorite to be the No. 1 pick of the 2021 draft. At FanDuel, Lawrence is -300, while Ohio State’s Justin Fields is +500. Lawrence was among the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy. But, because of the COVID-related cancellations of the Big Ten and Pac-12 seasons, that award might not be handed out this year. The ACC, where Clemson is a member, SEC, and Big 12 intend to play this season.</p>
<p>Even before the transactions, the Jaguars had the shortest odds at PointsBet to finish 0-16. On a two-team board, Jacksonville was +2,500 and Washington +5,000.</p>
<p>The Jaguars are, by far, the longshot to win an otherwise balanced AFC South. Indianapolis, which added quarterback Philip Rivers in free agency, is the favorite at +115. Tennessee, which reached the AFC title game last season, is +170. Houston is +355, and Jacksonville is far in the rear at +2,200.</p>
