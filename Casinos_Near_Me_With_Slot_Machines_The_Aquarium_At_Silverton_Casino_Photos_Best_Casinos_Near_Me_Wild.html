<p>The leading aggregator and provider of iGaming solutions, Relax Gaming, has further bolstered its footprint in one of its newest markets</p>
<p>The company entered the regulated iGaming market in Greece at the start of 2023 after it received the go-ahead by the Hellenic Gaming Commission. Since then, the company has enjoyed several launches with various local operators.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Expands Again in Greece</p>
<p>The most recent partnership sees Relax Gaming establish a content alliance with Interwetten, another respected operator in the market. Interwetten has been a long-standing entity in the iGaming and sports betting industry, providing unique experiences for players.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the operator will benefit from a range of experiences and games provided by Relax. Among those are excellent titles, such as the Money Train series, Temple Tumble, Money Cart, and Beast Mode. More games will also be made available thanks to Relax Gaming’s powerful third-party collaborations with Silver Bullet and Powered By Relax partner studios.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard hailed what is a third opportunity in the past two weeks to see the company strengthen its footprint in the market. Attard said:</p>
<p>We are absolutely thrilled to have signed this deal with Interwetten, there are very few operators out there that have the history and influence that they are able to boast. We could not have asked for a better partner to deliver our award-winning content portfolio to players in Greece. Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Interwetten head of product management, content and CRM Mario Bilic was similarly stoked to have the opportunity to see the company roll out fresh content by one of the world’s best aggregators and developers.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a long and successful partnership with the studio going forward,” Bilic said, confident in the quality of Relax Gaming’s own titles and partner products. The past few weeks have been particularly busy for the supplier.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has made its ambitions about the Greek market known and while observers may have expected only a handful of deals happening at first, the studio has defied those expectations signing up with both Novibet and Betsson, two of the leading iGaming brands in the country.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Relax Gaming has been similarly doubling down its B2B reach, securing a Supplier License in Sweden at the end of March. Relax Gaming is determined to continue growing across newly-regulated and established markets, bringing its products as it does.</p>
