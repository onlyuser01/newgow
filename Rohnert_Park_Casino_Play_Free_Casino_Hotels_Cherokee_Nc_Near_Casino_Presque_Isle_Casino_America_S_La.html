<p>Better Collective Names Therese Hillman Member of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>The leading developer of educational platforms within the iGaming industry, Better Collective, announced that it appointed Therese Hillman as a new member of its board of directors. The initial proposal to add Hillman as a member of the company’s board came last month. However, the final decision was taken during an annual general meeting today. During the online meeting, the shareholders approved proposals from the nomination committee.</p>
<p>Besides adding Hillman to the board of directors, the shareholders re-elected Jens Bager as chairman of the board of directors. Furthermore, the shareholders also re-appointed Klaus Holse, Leif Norgaard, Petra Von Rohr, and Todd Dunlap as members of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Back in February, Better Collective released its full-year results indicating an all-time high revenue growth in 2020. Furthermore, the company plans to keep the momentum and continue this trend in 2021.</p>
<p>Hillman Brings Significant Experience to Better Collective</p>
<p>Before joining Better Collective, Hillman served as a CEO at NetEnt. As a proven professional, she has shown strong financial and leadership skills, as well as a passion for sales and business development. When Hillman first joined NetEnt in January 2017, she served as chief financial officer. After that, in May 2018, she took an interim position as chief executive officer (CEO). Consequently, a month later, Hillman took the full-time position as CEO at NetEnt.</p>
<p>Besides NetEnt, she has also served as CEO at Gymgrossisten, an e-commerce sports nutrition company. At that position, Hillman was employed from April 2011 until December 2016. She has also served as a board member at Unibet Group between May 2015 and October 2016.</p>
<p>Hillman holds an international finance degree from the North Georgia College and State University, as well as a business administration degree from the University of Virginia – Darden Graduate School of Business Administration.
