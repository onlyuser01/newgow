    <h1>Brango Casino Casinos Blackhawk Niagara Casino Casino Colorado Borgata Casino Online Change at the H</h1>

<p>Global supplier of online gaming software Microgaming announced today its CEO John Coleman would be stepping down from the executive role at the end of the year and would be succeeded by the company’s COO, Andrew Clucas.</p>
<p>Stepping Down as CEO</p>
<p>Microgaming chief executive officer Coleman will step down on New Year’s Eve as CEO of the gaming software supplier, having spent nearly 17 years serving at executive roles at the company. Having served as chief financial officer (CFO) for nearly 14 years, in 2018, Coleman was promoted to the position of CEO.</p>
<p>Honored to “have led” the company as CEO, Coleman said this moment was “a natural time” for him to embark on his next adventure, leaving “a strong leadership structure in place” and “exciting future ahead.” Presenting his successor, Coleman outlined his brilliance and leadership skills, while expressing his confidence that Clucas “will steer Microgaming to new success.”</p>
<p>During the years of his tenure as CEO, Coleman helped Microgaming drive its strategy and vision, diversify its product range and strengthen its position as a trusted software supplier in the global gaming market.</p>
<p>Coleman’s openness and empathy helped him place the wellbeing of employees, safer gambling and corporate social responsibility at the center of his decisions and will continue to support Microgaming’s overall efforts as he will remain in a non-executive role at the company.</p>
<p>The Successor</p>
<p>“John has been an outstanding leader and ambassador of the business for almost two decades, and I cannot praise him highly enough for his many achievements and contributions,” said Microgaming COO Clucas, adding that he is “delighted to be picking the mantle from him,” and serve as CEO of Microgaming.</p>
<p>Clucas is determined to lead the business with “the same passion and commitment,” shown by Coleman. Clucas joined Isle of Man-based Microgaming in 2009, having built a successful career in the Royal Navy Air Force. Clucas performed in several roles across operations, including business development and sales, before being promoted as chief operating officer in 2018.</p>
<p>In another announcement today, Microgaming said it would be unloading its Quickfire distribution business and portfolio to Games Global Limited in a transaction that is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. Games Global is set to acquire 25 game studios and over 3,000 titles, including Microgaming’s progressive jackpot network and distribution.</p>
