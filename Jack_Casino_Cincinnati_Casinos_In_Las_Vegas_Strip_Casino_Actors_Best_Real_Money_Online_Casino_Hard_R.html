    <h1>Jack Casino Cincinnati Casinos In Las Vegas Strip Casino Actors Best Real Money Online Casino Hard R</h1>

<p>XB Net is making another stride towards the global horse betting market after conquering the North American and Australian regions with NorthAlley, a leading platform in India. The new collaboration will allow XB Net to extend its range of experiences and local pool-wagering services from tracks in Australia and North America to NorthAlley.</p>
<p>XB Net Expands Global Horse Racing Market to India</p>
<p>This will create a stronger value for the platform and equip it with a flexible programming schedule along with streams and numerous wagering opportunities that will boost engagement with existing customers and create numerous new opportunities for people to participate in horse racing betting.</p>
<p>NorthAlley provides all race clubs in India with Totalizator technology which includes properties such as the Hyderabad Race Club. XB Net provides an extensive variety of events that are delivered directly to bettors through partner organizations. NorthAlley can now communicate information about 700 Australian races a year from the country’s top race clubs, including the Flemington, Caulfield, and Moonee Valley, and naturally the Melbourne Cup, arguably one of the biggest events anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>XB Net naturally has direct feeds to events such as the Triple Crown, along with all flagship events to name the Belmont Stakes, the Preakness, and the Kentucky Derby. The supplier also covers the Breeders’ Cup World Championship. Overall, NorthAlley has access to all leading horse races as a result. XB Net SVP of international Simon Fraser said:</p>
<p>“NorthAlley have already proven themselves most adept at securing some cornerstone partnerships at the elite Hyderabad and Madras Racing Clubs, while the Royal Western India Turf Club in Mumbai is next on our agenda.” XB Net SVP of international Simon Fraser</p>
<p>The company is confident that it would continue to grow its global audience and the range of products extended to partners anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, NorthAlley CEO Suresh Paladugu welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with a powerful supplier of horse racing feeds such as XB Net. The company would be able to boost NorthAlley’s offer by providing all the leading markets and ample coverage. He added:</p>
<p>“Australian racing, above all, seems to fit seamlessly into our overall offering, with its time zone naturally preceding India’s domestic action and other sporting programs. Now we’re adding U.S. racing rights too for our players, we can’t wait to see how these products perform over a packed summer of racing highlights, including the Triple Crown events of the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.” NorthAlley CEO Suresh Paladugu</p>
<p>Despite a bit of a lull compared to sports betting, horse racing and betting on horse derbies is still a vibrant industry. There has been some slowdown in recent years but the fact remains that companies such as XB Net are able to unify the global interest in horse racing. The company operates in multiple markets and has recently entered Italy through a Sisal partnership.</p>
