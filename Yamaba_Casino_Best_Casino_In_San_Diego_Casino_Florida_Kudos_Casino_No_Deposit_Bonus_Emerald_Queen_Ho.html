    <h1>Yamaba Casino Best Casino In San Diego Casino Florida Kudos Casino No Deposit Bonus Emerald Queen Ho</h1>

<p>Great Canadian Gaming Corporation has rebranded to Great Canadian Entertainment with the new change of name and identity better aligned with the company’s long-term strategy and ambitions for the Canadian gaming market. The corporate website has also been overhauled as a part of the experience with a new loyalty program, Great Canadian Rewards, set up for the company’s 12 Ontario properties.</p>
<p>Building up Customer Loyalty with Rewards Program</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity in a press release, Great Canadian CEO Anthony Rodio said that the company was focusing entirely on offering a leading gaming experience to guests. Part of this includes the new loyalty program which Rodio expects will translate into better hospitality overall.</p>
<p>Through the new loyalty program, members will be able to earn and redeem various loyalty rewards. This will apply to any of the 12 properties currently operational in Ontario. Members will be able to generate points both in-person and by participating remotely. Great Canadian is fully committed to maintaining its land-based properties and has already enacted a series of investments to bring them up to scratch.</p>
<p>One of the flagship investments includes Casino Woodbine which will get an upgrade in 2023 and the expansion of Pickering Casino Resort which will reopen by the end of the year. Great Canadian COO Matt Anfinson welcomed the opportunity to diversify the group’s amenities and offer fresh experiences to visitors.</p>
<p>More food and beverage offerings, better entertainment venues and a lot more is coming to ensure that the guest experience is up to scratch, the executive explained. “We’re very excited about our new corporate strategy and the investments we have in progress, and those to come,” he added.</p>
<p>New Hospitality Experiences and Expanding Venues</p>
<p>Great Canadian’s ambitions for Canada are much broader as the company currently operates 25 properties across the entire country, with almost half of those in Ontario. Ontario’s newly-regulated gambling market has not curbed Great Canadian’s ambitions to pursue further expansion opportunities either. Rodio explained that the new offerings are already on their way and said:</p>
<p>Our new brand and new rewards program reflect our clear vision for the company’s future. We want to give our guests a sought-after destination and entertainment experience that ups the ante for the gaming industry in Canada. Great Canadian CEO Anthony Rodio</p>
<p>The upcoming Casino Woodbine in Toronto, Ontario, will feature a 400-room hotel, an entertainment venue that can seat 5,000 guests and also an improved and expanded casino floor. The prospect of more gambling transitioning online is not an immediate concern for Great Canadian which is confident that foot traffic on its floors will remain steady.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Picketing Casino Resort in Ontario will go ahead with a 275-room hotel and an entertainment venue that can seat as many as 2,500 guests.</p>
