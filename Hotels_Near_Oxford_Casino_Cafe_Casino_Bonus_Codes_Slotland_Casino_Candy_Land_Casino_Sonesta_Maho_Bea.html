<p>Casino management and information software provider Table Trac has signed two new exciting deals with two different Alabama-based gaming operators. Greentracks and The Palace Bingo will be joining the list of Table Trac partners and enjoy the “unique platform and architecture” of their products.</p>
<p>Table Trac is currently available in more than 270 casinos located in 13 different countries. Its management system offers a lot of versatility and it is compliant with various gaming as well as entertainment center environments. These entertainment centers host gaming terminals that resemble and play similar to slot machines. However, the actual odds and wins rely on the use of Bingo Cards, the Pull tab, and historical horse race results.</p>
<p>What Do Greenetrack and The Palace Bingo Have to Offer?</p>
<p>Greentrack is a popular racetrack and casino known as a racino located in Eutaw, Alabama. The racino hosts more than 1,500 high-stakes slot machines that resemble the game of bingo. Greenetrack also simulcasts thoroughbred horse racing and greyhound racing from more than 40 tracks located all around the US. The racino is open on a 24-hour basis and it also hosts a greyhound track featuring live races in season.</p>
<p>The Palace Bingo is a new bingo hall that has just opened its doors in July. The bingo hall calls itself “the place where the winners play”. The location also offers a variety of terminal-based games that have received approval from their local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Table Trac’s president spoke about the flexibility of its one-of-a-kind platform and products that are able to provide “accounting and player club functionality” to special environments like the ones promoted by the two new operators in Alabama.</p>
<p>Table Trac Installed Six Systems in Fresh Location in the Second Quarter</p>
<p>During the second quarter of the year, Table Trac installed six new systems in fresh locations in the US. The list includes Wisconsin and Nevada with new locations in Littlehorn, Lucky Strike, Lake of the Torches Resorts, and Bighorn. Table Trac also recently strengthened its foothold in the LatAm region when it signed a partnership with the Waymroe Casino located in Panama. At the end of last week, Table Trac published its financial results. The report showed an important increase in revenue of 70% thanks to the fresh installations as well as its distributors that powered 40 extra additional locations. This helped the company supply casinos with a huge, unprecedented number of games. The company also expressed its plans of expansion aimed at Las Vegas.</p>
