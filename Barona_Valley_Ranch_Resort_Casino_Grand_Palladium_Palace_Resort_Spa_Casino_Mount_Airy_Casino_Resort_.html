<p>Aristocrat Technologies, a subsidiary of gambling technology group listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Aristocrat Leisure, announced today the launch of its new Aristocrat Future Leaders (AFL) program, a comprehensive educational track tailor-made for recent graduate students in the US.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to invest in the future of gaming with the introduction of Aristocrat Future Leaders.” Hector Fernandez, President, Aristocrat Gaming™</p>
<p>Seeking Top Talent</p>
<p>The AFL rotational program will provide a unique opportunity for recent college graduates to learn the basic tenets of the land-based gaming industry from the slot technology manufacturer, and eventually start a full-time job with competitive benefits and compensation.</p>
<p>“By prioritizing education and placing the gaming supplier industry at the forefront of career opportunities, we look forward to welcoming top talent that will grow their career with Aristocrat for the long term.” Hector Fernandez, President, Aristocrat Gaming™</p>
<p>The program is looking to provide an immersive educational experience for its participants, as each one of them will spend up to 8 months in different commercial departments such as finance, operations, and marketing, among others, before rotating to another department.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Expands on Many Fronts</p>
<p>The rollout of the educational program is the latest initiative undertaken by Aristocrat in the US, following on the successful market entry into the video gaming terminal (VGT) market in Illinois in August, when the Las Vegas-headquartered gaming company deployed more than 300 machines across the state and provided gaming content specifically developed to meet regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Illinois VGTs market is among the largest nationwide, featuring 7,137 locations across the state, bars, taverns, restaurants, convenience stores, gas stations and others which hold a liquor license. In just 7 years since its launch in 2012, VGTs in the Prairie State grew revenue from $12.3 million to $1.67 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>In October, Aristocrat Technologies signed a partnership deal with the Las Vegas Raiders and the Allegiant Stadium to become an official partner of the franchise from the National Football League (NFL) and have in-stadium and in-game year-long brand representation at the Raiders stadium.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership deal, the Owners East Club, a venue offering exclusive experience and a premium bar service at the Allegiant Stadium, was renamed to Aristocrat Club, and the company became a presenting sponsor of the Raiders 50/50 Raffle.</p>
<p>Also in October, Aristocrat teamed up with Las Vegas-based casino operator Boyd Gaming to launch its cashless wagering digital wallet technology at Blue Chip Casino Resort Spa in Michigan City, Indiana. The solution eliminates the need to redeem tickets or handle cash at slot machines and creates a seamless customer experience.</p>
