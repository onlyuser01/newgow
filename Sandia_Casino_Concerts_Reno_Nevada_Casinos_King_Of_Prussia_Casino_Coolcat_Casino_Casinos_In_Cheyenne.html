    <h1>Sandia Casino Concerts Reno Nevada Casinos King Of Prussia Casino Coolcat Casino Casinos In Cheyenne</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru team,</p>
<p>this is the second complaint in a row against Goldwin.</p>
<p>I had 7,200 euros in my account that I could pay out.</p>
<p>I decided to play at Jammin Jars 2 for high stakes</p>
<p>to trigger a free spins bonus, which is only determined by a scale</p>
<p>must be collected. It takes a lot of turns and</p>
<p>Time to fill up this gauge in this game with these 6 freegames</p>
<p>to trigger which then allow guaranteed unknown profit.</p>
<p>I went to sleep around 4am with $3,300 left and the gauge on the Jammin Jars 2 was pretty much full. So I already invested 3900 euros for the game. I wanted to trigger these 6 free games the next day. When I woke up I saw the email from Goldwin's finance department that my account has been banned from playing (due to fund source verification) and that I should withdraw the money and once the funds are fully withdrawn my account will be permanently closed. I applied for the maximum weekly withdrawal of 3000 euros and the money was paid out immediately. I still have 300 euros left in my account and have to wait 1 week to be able to pay out another 300 euros.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I received a great bonus for reaching high levels through many bets beforehand and certainly made a total of spins for 500,000 euros, which cost me many of my wins that I did not pay out.</p>
<p>I played so much not least to reach the prestige level to get prioritized payouts and cashback.</p>
<p>As soon as I reached the prestige level, my account was closed. If I had known that this was happening I would have paid out a lot more money in the past regardless of the reward tiers because all tiers except Prestige tier are useless.</p>
<p>-I am now mainly concerned with my bonus game from Jammin Jars 2 for which I have turned in cash money of 3,900 euros and cannot trigger the game</p>
<ul>
<li>for the level bonus earned with a lot of money (300 free spins of my choice - WITHOUT wagering - with a deposit of 100 euros or more)</li>
</ul>
<p>-that my account can continue to be used because this (source of money) was not a reason to close my account.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the casino closed my account because I have now withdrawn a little more than I deposited and am near the end of the highest reward level, although you actually have to lose at least 50,000 euros in cash to get this far.</p>
<p>Please help me to get back all what I have earned or the casino should reward me appropriately if I cannot use my benefits and have spent money pointlessly.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
