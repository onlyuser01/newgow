    <h1>Fitz Casino Tunica Best Western Plus Casino Royale Mint Casino Casinos Arizona The Pass Casino PlayC</h1>

<p>I was informed about a " free" $10 chip, (that is you don't have to deposit first to play. ) at play croco online. I decided to try it out, I looked at the playthrough and it was $600 and the max amount you could take from the bonus is $180. As I started playing and winning it occurred to me I was approaching the $600 and I figured I would be stopped. Or I would forfeit the playthrough. the I kept upping my bet finally at 20$ spins, and won up to 1400, building incrementally, not in a jackpot . I started at .20 spins. Suddenly the game froze blacked out and reappeared I had only $ 275. Where did the rest of it go? It took a while for me to find out. I didn't try to withdraw the 275 as I played it away because I didn't really want to win anymore if they were just going to take it. Looked at my player history and it showed I applied to withdraw the money and it was approved but I didn't withdraw the money the amount in question or being said I withdrew is</p>
<p>$1237.47. the coupon was reversed, when I contacted the customer support, at first no one respond. Later that day I finally got a response and they told me that they had the right to take the amount over when I hit the playthrough at $600. I'd argue I hit the $600 well before that. But I don't know I know it was close it doesn't seem right that they should just be able to take $1200 where did it go? And if I could only keep 180 supposedly why was I left with 275 in my account? What I've ever been able to get that money? I have a screenshot of my account history and the date and the transactions that took place that I didn't instigate they were done for me I was playing the game Kronos gold.</p>
