    <h1>Casino Rv Parks Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel Casino Bluechip Casino Couer D Alene Casino Hotels Near S</h1>

<p>I get 25 free spins a week from this casino.</p>
<p>I first won 600 euros when I was a little quietly prlas. I made a withdrawal request for 500 euros.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the victory and asked for the documents.</p>
<p>I sent them to them.</p>
<p>Reported that it will take 5 business days for the account to be verified. There was a notification that my ID card needs to be renewed. I ordered a new ID card.</p>
<p>At this point, I had already contacted the game’s producer, Betsoft, who congratulated me on the win and after telling them they said there can never be any outstanding jackpot winnings.</p>
<p>They said that of course the casino had to pay and were connected to the black diamond casino.</p>
<p>Then I got a message from them that they will soon be contacting me about the payment because they had been to their AMS (I don’t know what this is) and at the same time apologized when they now have a tight situation because of Covid 19 and things are not going that way.</p>
<p>The Casino cannot refuse to pay a progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>I have step by step all the screenshots.</p>
<p>At my own account at Black Diamon Casino (I finally got a new ID card from the police department), the money was transferred so that it was no longer even a euro with bonus money but could be withdrawn.</p>
<p>I made € 4,000 withdrawals from the casino. They stated that I could raise vaam 4000 e / week.</p>
<p>I was wondering if it would take me two years to get my money.</p>
<p>Well then, there was a chance to raise a visa on the card. So I had made the deposit they required for 25 euros and I was only able to withdraw it through some services unknown to me.</p>
<p>I then made a cash out of someone's bank and now my account had 77 euros and the whole amount has disappeared from my game account.</p>
<p>I've been in contact with Betsoft but they have tsto varmaam closed covid19 because when they do not even availe mails or messages.</p>
<p>I have also been in touch with Black Diamond Casino owner of the company.</p>
