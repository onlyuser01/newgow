<p>Information about UK casinos</p>
<p>Thanks to the quality of the UK Gambling Commission, players from the United Kingdom can choose from arguably the best selection of online gambling sites in the world. UK online casinos are known for their trustworthiness and player safety, which makes it relatively easy for players from the UK to find a high-quality casino website suitable for them.</p>
<p>Of course, not all casinos are created equal. UK players can choose from big and established online casinos as well as new UK casino sites with fresh features and bonuses. Whether you just want to quickly find a good casino, choose from top 10 or 20 UK online casinos, or browse all casinos that accept UK players, this list can help you do it and discover casino sites suitable for you.</p>

<p>UK gambling licenses and legislation</p>
<p>Gambling Commission is the only authority that regulates and licenses gambling providers in Great Britain. This includes national lottery, bookmakers, brick-and-mortar casinos, and, of course, online casinos.</p>
<p>The UK gambling commission was set up in 2005, under the Gambling Act of 2005, to regulate commercial gambling in Great Britain. Then, there has been the Gambling Act of 2014, which requires any operator wishing to interact with consumers in Great Britain to have a license from the Gambling Commission. This means that all online casinos which want to offer their services to players from the UK need to have a Gambling Commission license.</p>
<p>Gambling Commission aims to make sure that:</p>
<p>gambling is conducted in a fair way,</p>
<p>gambling isn’t a source of crime or disorder, associated with it, or used to support it,</p>
<p>vulnerable people and children are protected from harm or exploitation.</p>
<p>It’s clear from these objectives that player protection really is a priority for the Gambling Commission, which is why players from Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) should always play in casinos that have a license issued by it. What’s more, casinos without a Gambling Commission license operate in Great Britain illegally and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Apart from the Gambling Commission, there are other regulatory authorities which might be of interest for players from the UK. The strict rules related to the Gambling Commission apply just to Great Britain. Gambling in Northern Ireland is regulated under the Betting, Gambling, Lotteries &amp; Amusements (NI) Order 1985, which is quite old and doesn’t account for online gambling very well.</p>
<p>Additionally, prior to the Gambling Act 2014, subjects without a Gambling Commission license were allowed to operate in Great Britain. Licensed operators from so-called "whitelisted countries" (EEA countries, Alderney, Antigua and Barbuda, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Tasmania) could provide their services to English, Scottish, and Welsh citizens, but this was revoked in 2014 and is no longer true.</p>
<p>Starting from April 14, 2020, the use of credit cards to gamble is banned in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Types of UK online casinos to choose from</p>
<p>There is no clear specification of online casino types; however, it’s obvious that online casinos can be separated into groups with certain qualities. In this section, we’ll list common "types" of online gambling sites, which might help you figure out what kind of gambling site you want to play at.</p>
<p>Online casinos vs. betting websites with casino games</p>
<p>Sportsbetting is extremely popular in the UK, and many bookmakers also allow their customers to play casino games. However, gambling sites that focus on sportsbetting and only operate casino games "on the side" are sometimes lacklustre when it comes to their online casino offerings.</p>
<p>If you also like to place sports bets, these will most likely be the best choice for you. On the other hand, if you only play online casino games and don’t place other kinds of bets, you might want to look for websites which specialize in casino games. This is why you’ll find information about sportsbetting being the site’s primary focus in some of our casino reviews.</p>
<p>New UK online casinos and established brands</p>
<p>Next, there is the question of whether a new or established casino is better for you. Some players prefer big brands which have been around for a while because of their high-grade security and safety, while others like to try new casinos because of their modern features and generally more interesting bonus offers, which they use to attract new customers.</p>
<p>The choice is yours, but you should always be aware of both positives and negatives of these groups of casinos. New casinos, for example, might have great bonus offers and modern websites, but you can’t always be sure about how they treat players and whether they really pay out big wins. It usually takes some time for a bad casino to show its "true colours", which is why you need to be careful with fresh casino websites. This is why we give new sites a "Fresh" rating before we figure out what rating they really deserve.</p>
<p>UK slot sites and live casinos</p>
<p>When it comes to game selection, online casinos tend to be quite similar, at least to a person without extensive experience in the online gambling field. Most of them allow players to choose from slot machines, table games (with or without a live dealer) and some other common types of games.</p>
<p>However, some online casinos specialize in a certain type of games. Most common are so-called slot casino sites, which focus on building a vast library of slots for their players to choose from.</p>
<p>Then there are also live casinos, which operate table games with a live dealer. These are preferred by many table games enthusiasts, as they bring a more authentic experience close to that of brick-and-mortar casinos. If you wish to find the UK’s best live casinos, use the filter "Live roulette casinos".</p>
<p>Bonus offers of UK online casino sites</p>
<p>Online gambling wouldn’t be the same without bonus offers for both new and existing players, and online casinos available in the United Kingdom aren’t an exception. UK players can get no deposit bonuses, deposit bonuses (both welcome and reload bonuses), cashback bonuses, and other kinds of promotional offers.</p>
<p>You can also see available bonuses in this casino list and in our detailed casino reviews, but if bonuses are a priority for you, you might be better off browsing our lists of bonuses for UK players. Here are some links you can use depending on what you are looking for:</p>
<p>After clicking these links, you will see only bonuses available for players from the UK. You can also use our advanced filters to cut down the selection to offers and venues which are of interest to you, just like you can here, in our list of best UK casinos.</p>
<p>How to pick from our list and choose the best UK casino for you</p>
<p>Our independent casino review team has thoroughly examined over 1900 casino websites, and we continue to add more venues to our database every month. Not all of them accept players from the United Kingdom, which is why we’ve created this list of UK casinos, all of which accept players from the UK.</p>
<p>The quickest and easiest way to pick a reputable online casino suitable for UK players is to open the "Recommended" tab in this list and explore the venues that appear at the top. This is where you will find the best options overall. If your preferences are more specific, other tabs and filters can help you to narrow the selection down and make the casino-selection process a lot easier.</p>
<p>Either way, we recommend reading the entire casino review before making the final decision and registering. Our reviews contain all important information about the casinos, including player complaints (which give you a good idea about how each casino treats its players), blacklists (which tell you which casinos you should stay away from), available bonuses, licenses, related casinos, available payment methods, game selection, and much more.</p>
<p>Our article called "How to choose an online casino" can give you an idea about what you should look for in an online casino. If you are new to the world of online gambling, give it a read, so that you are able to make a well-informed decision.</p>
