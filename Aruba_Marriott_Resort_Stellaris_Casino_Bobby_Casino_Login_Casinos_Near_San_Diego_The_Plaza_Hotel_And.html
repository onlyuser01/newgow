    <h1>Aruba Marriott Resort Stellaris Casino Bobby Casino Login Casinos Near San Diego The Plaza Hotel And</h1>

<p>(Disputed amount is .1298 BTC)</p>
<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I confirmed a withdrawal request on August 15 in the amount of</p>
<p>.1298 BTC.</p>
<p>I was hoping that by now, BitDice would process my withdrawals in a timely manner (72 hours as they advertise) but clearly this just isnâ€™t going to happen.</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, BitDice has now Deactivated my account.</p>
<p>After seeing many, many people complain about their withdrawals and continuously being lied to and having nowhere to turn, I took it upon myself to post links to my AskGambler complaints in the chat for others to follow. It appears to have worked as others are now starting to get their withdrawals after posting their Complaints on that site.</p>
<p>Chat mods didn't like that so rather than just banning me from chat, they have now chosen to Deactivate my account which still has</p>
<p>.231 BTC in it.</p>
<p>What kind of scam is that?</p>
<p>You crooks have been holding my money for MONTHS and now want to Deactivate my account?</p>
<p>BitDice, I want my .1298 BTC from this pending withdrawal and the .231 BTC you still owe me.</p>
<p>Please see 2 attached files showing</p>
<p>-Withdrawal confirmation from August 15, 2022</p>
<p>-Deactivation of my account</p>
<p>Thank you kindly in advance.</p>
