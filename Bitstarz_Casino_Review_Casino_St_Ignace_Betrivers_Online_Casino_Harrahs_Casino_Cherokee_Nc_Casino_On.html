<p>Rush Street Interactive (RSI) is on its way to Mexico. Grupo Multimedios Mexico, a Mexican media organization, has established an exclusive partnership to bring the online casino and sports betting company to the country.</p>
<p>RSI signed a 25-year agreement to operate an online casino and sportsbook in Mexico. A Grupo Multimedios subsidiary holds an online gambling license in Mexico, facilitating the partnership. RSI will be able to use Grupo Multimedios media assets and distribution channels as part of its content integration and promotion efforts.</p>
<p>Grupo Multimedios has been around for 89 years. Its experience spans many industries, including media, sports and entertainment, as well as property and retail. The company's media assets include television, radio, print and billboards, as well as digital.</p>
<p>Notable media include the digital sports property Mediotiempo, which attracts more than seven million unique users each month, as well as Milenio, a digital news source and information source. It also owns Canal 6, with its network of 22 television stations and 63 radio stations.</p>
<p>Angel Cong, co-CEO of Multimedios, said, "It is very exciting to start this partnership with RSI. Their experience and amazing team will help our group achieve a new partnered vision of continuous growth and entrepreneurship. RSI has been successful in the American and Colombian online casino and sportsbook markets; we have no doubt that together we will achieve the same in Mexico."</p>
<p>RSI was the US's first gaming company to open a regulated online betting site in Latin America, with RushBet's arrival in 2018. According to data from Colombia's gaming regulator, RushBet accounted for nearly 20% of all online gambling and sports betting transactions in Colombia in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, CEO of RSI, added, "We are excited to partner with Grupo Multimedios, one of the most respected media enterprises in Mexico, which we believe will serve as a great accelerant for building our online gaming operations in the country.</p>
<p>"Mexico represents an attractive market opportunity, with a population of more than 130 million, which, when combined with Colombia's population of 50 million, will expand RSI's offering in Latin America significantly."</p>
<p>Since last year, Mexico has been updating its gambling regulations. This has led to increased interest on the part of operators. In addition to the arrival of RSI, SkillOnNet brought its PlayUzu brand to the country last month, and EveryMatrix was tapped to power Foliatti Casino as the latter launched in the country.</p>
