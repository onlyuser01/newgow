<p>Technology provider for the gaming industry Scientific Games (SG) announced its instant and hybrid lottery games contract with Loto-Quebec was extended and would run through January 31, 2022.</p>
<p>“Scientific Games produced Loto-Québec’s very first instant game 50 years ago, and the tradition of our partnership will continue through this contract extension.” Marie-Claudel Lalonde, Senior Director, Strategy and Marketing Communications, Loto-Québec</p>
<p>5 Decades of Partnership</p>
<p>Looking to support responsible revenue-generating lottery programs across the world, SG has been a trusted supplier to the lottery operator for more than 5 decades by creating games from its manufacturing facility in Montreal.</p>
<p>“Our entire team in Montreal looks forward to continuing to advance the lottery’s game innovation for the enjoyment of Québec players with products driven by analytics and insights that are unmatched in the lottery industry.” John Schulz, Senior Vice President, Instant Products, Scientific Games</p>
<p>Currently, SG provides most of the lottery operator’s specialty games, with the total number of instant games designed and manufactured for Loto-Quebec for the last 50 years in excess of 4,500, among which some unique products such as Ultime, La Poule aux Oeufs d’Or and Boîte à Bingo.</p>
<p>“Together we have innovated creative games to entertain Quebec palyers and generate funding for vital programs in the province.” Marie-Claudel Lalonde, Senior Director, Strategy and Marketing Communications, Loto-Québec</p>
<p>World Leader in Instant Lottery Games</p>
<p>Providing games, technology and services to more than 150 lotteries worldwide, as well as nearly every lottery operator in North America, including SidePlay Entertainment, after an exclusivity deal was signed in June 2020, SG is the largest creator and manufacturer of lottery instant products.</p>
<p>“We are also proud of our history as a manufacturing employer in the east Montreal community and the many talented residents who help produce Loto-Quebec games for the company” John Schulz, Senior Vice President, Instant Products, Scientific Games</p>
<p>SG, which supplies all top 10 performing instant game lotteries in the world, is responsible for generating more than 70% of global sales of instant game products.</p>
<p>Last month, Scientific Games joined for another year the campaign aimed at raising awareness about the risks lottery products pose to children, seeking to discourage actions from adults such as giving lottery tickets as presents. SG has been participating in the holiday campaign since 2018.</p>
<p>The “Gift Responsibly. Lottery Tickets Aren’t Child’s Play” campaign initiated by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) features participation from all Canadian and US lottery operators and is supported by non-lottery organizations such as the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL) and the World Lottery Association (WLC).</p>
