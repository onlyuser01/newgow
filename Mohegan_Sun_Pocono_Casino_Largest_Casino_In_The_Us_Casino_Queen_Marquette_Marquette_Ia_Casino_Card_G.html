<p>Online sports betting, gaming, and entertainment company Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced today it entered into a sports betting partnership with the only resort built around professional football, Hall of Fame Village, in Ohio.</p>
<p>Retail Sportsbook at Hall of Fame Village</p>
<p>The 10-year agreement reached with Hall of Fame Resort &amp; Entertainment Company will allow RSI to operate a premium sportsbook at the Hall of Fame Village. Johnson Controls, a provider of digital systems and solutions to make buildings smarter and a partner of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, will power RSI’s sportsbook.</p>
<p>RSI chief executive officer Richard Schwartz expressed his excitement to partner with the company that has an “exceptional reach in professional football and beyond” and “shares RSI’s drive to create fun” customer experiences to remember.</p>
<p>“We look forward to offering a best-in-class sportsbook commensurate with the prestige of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Hall of Fame Village that fans across the country and world can enjoy.” Richard Schwartz, CEO, RSI</p>
<p>An inspiring museum on its own, the Pro Football Hall of Fame is home to the world’s largest collection of professional football memorabilia, paying tribute to individual talent and triumphs in the sport.</p>
<p>Under a sponsorship component of the agreement, RSI gained access to Hall of Fame Village’s signage, branding and certain media assets and will leverage the resort’s brand partnerships to gain access to Pro Football Hall of Famers and other legends of the game.</p>
<p>‘Outstanding Reputation, Impressive Sportsbook Results’</p>
<p>Speaking about the agreement, Hall of Fame Village president and CEO Michael Crawford outlined the importance of the legalization of sports betting in Ohio and the variety of opportunities it opened up across “multiple business lines” of the company.</p>
<p>“We considered many different retail sportsbook operators, but selected RSI because of its outstanding reputation, impressive sportsbook results in other markets, and the quality and experience of its team.” Michael Crawford, President and CEO, Hall of Fame Village</p>
<p>Eager to provide guests and fans with a “new and enhanced way to interact with their favorite sports,” Crawford is looking forward to collaborating with RSI to “bring a retail sportsbook to the Hall of Fame Village’s Fan Engagement Zone.”</p>
<p>The Fan Engagement Zone is part of an ongoing expansion at the resort, alongside the addition of a performance center, indoor water park, Hilton hotel, and office and retail space. Besides the sportsbook, the Fan Engagement Zone will also feature restaurants and retail offerings.</p>
<p>One of the largest ongoing construction projects in Ohio, the Hall of Fame Village is connecting the Pro Football Hall of Fame with the stadium featuring the first pre-season game in the NFL, Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, and the Hall of Fame Village Sports Complex.</p>
