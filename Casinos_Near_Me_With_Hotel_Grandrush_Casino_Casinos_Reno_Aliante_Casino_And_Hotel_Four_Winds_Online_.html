<p>Real Madrid Determined to Retain Their UCL Title</p>
<p>Los Blancos are in top form right now in all competitions. The evidence of their brilliant run is that exactly seven days before the UCL match with Chelsea, they destroyed Barcelona 4-0 at Camp Nou. Karim Benzema scored a hat-trick in that game, while we also saw Vinicius Junior score one goal.</p>
<p>We expect a lot from those two in the duel with Chelsea on Wednesday as well. One of the reasons is that those two guys have some really good memories from the games with this rival. Last season, Real Madrid beat Chelsea 3-1 in London with all three goals scored by Benzema. Chelsea fought back in Madrid, getting to 3-1 in the 90 minutes, taking the game to extra time.</p>
<p>The Blues got their dreams crushed just six minutes into the first extra time period by Benzema – he scored the winner on an assist from Vinicius Junior.</p>
<p>Lampard Is Back in Charge of Chelsea</p>
<p>After sacking Graham Potter, the London Blues appointed Frank Lampard as their caretaker manager. He’s back at Chelsea after two years and is hoping his second stint will be more successful. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem very likely that he’s going to be able to take them to the semifinal of the Champions League.</p>
<p>The thing is that he just hasn’t had much time to prepare the team for the clash with Real Madrid. And even if that wasn’t the case, Chelsea would still be seen as the underdog. This goes especially for the first leg, which is played in the Spanish capital.</p>
<p>The Blues have been pretty disappointing on the road this season. Their most recent away game in the UCL saw them lose to Dortmund 1-0. In the group phase of this competition, however, they did okay, going 2-0-1.</p>
<p>They defeated Salzburg 2-1 in Austria and AC Milan 2-0 in Italy, while losing 1-0 to Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia in what was Thomas Tuchel’s final game as the Chelsea boss. After losing to Dinamo, Potter took charge, which lasted until a week ago.</p>
<p>Real Madrid vs. Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Carlo Ancelotti’s boys are winning this. No other option but Real Madrid winning on Wednesday seems viable. Everything seems to be going in Los Blancos’ favor. They’ve got the players, as well as the manager who knows how to win big games. Plus, they’re playing on their turf, which is bound to give them even more motivation to destroy Chelsea.</p>
<p>Pick: Real Madrid to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
