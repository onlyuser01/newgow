    <h1>Excaliber Hotel Casino Sam S Hotel And Casino Shreveport La Casinos Near Phoenix Biggest Casino In V</h1>

<p>The prominent iGaming supplier and developer of content has further expanded its reach in the regulated iGaming market in Ontario</p>
<p>The new partnership features Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino, a trusted and regulated local operator that will help Wazdan gain further exposure in the market.</p>
<p>In turn, Caesars will also gain access to more worthwhile titles that are bound to strike home with the operator’s own audiences. Wazdan is making this possible thanks to its Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) license the company was able to secure in May 2022.</p>
<p>Bringing Numerous Engagement Features to Caesars</p>
<p>Caesars is also very happy to see Wazdan’s products brought to its library, as they would allow the operator to quickly expand its reach with local audiences. One of the flagship games to be featured here is 9 Coins, which has been shortlisted in the Best New Game category at the EGR North America Awards 2023.</p>
<p>There will be more titles debuting with Caesars as a result of this important tie-up. Amongst those titles are Power of Gods: Hades, Burning Sun, Sizzling Eggs, Magic Spins, as well as Power of Sun: Svarog, Sizzling Kingdom: Bison, Hot Slot: Magic Bombs, and more. On the whole, Wazdan is bringing its hard-hitting titles to the fore, offering players an outstanding selection of titles to enjoy in real time.</p>
<p>Another added plus here is the fact that Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino will similarly have access to Wazdan’s outstanding suite of engagement features, such as the aptly called Player Engagement Suite that brings features such as Hold the Jackpot, Collect to Infinity, Stick to Infinity, and Cash Infinity.</p>
<p>Wazdan Welcomes Strong and Impactful Partnership</p>
<p>Wazdan is very happy to see this partnership come to fruition in the market, as it allows it to quickly and reliably double down on its commercial path in the North American market. Wazdan commercial director Bekki D’Agata was very happy to see the company team up with Caesars.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to bring our innovative slot offering to the Ontario market as we continue to deliver impressive results for operators worldwide,” D’Agata said. Meanwhile, Caesars Digital SVP of iGaming Matthew Sunderland added that the company was thrilled to introduce fresh content by what is considered one of the most significant suppliers in the industry.</p>
<p>Wazdan is a perfect match that will bring added value to Caesars’ valued customers, Sunderland concluded.</p>
