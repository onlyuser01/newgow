<p>Safer Gambling Week in the United Kingdom is an annual campaign that focuses on promoting safe and responsible gambling. It’s universally supported by regulated companies in the sector and this year, the initiative is backed by EGO, EGamingOnline.com, and SkillOnNet’s partner affiliate program which is working with the company’s numerous brands.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet Readies to Support Safer Gambling with Brands and Affiliates</p>
<p>This includes brands such as PlayOJO, Genting Casino, SpinGenie, and Slingo, among others. All brands, along with the affiliate partners, will be making sure to deliver safe and responsible gambling messages during the period between October 17 and October 23 when the event is officially running.</p>
<p>All brands focused on the UK gambling market will promote Safer Gambling Week using various signage and imagery to drive the message home to audiences in the market. Players and members will receive safe and responsible gambling marketing communications, among others.</p>
<p>The initiative will be promoted across a number of social media networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and the week is dedicated to bringing the industry together in a joint response against the prevalence of problem gambling among player bases. Much has been done to address the issue of late.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling is a key pivot of a long-anticipated review of the gambling industry in the United Kingdom. The Gambling Act review has been postponed on several occasions, most recently on the occasion of the change of power at 10 Downing Street.</p>
<p>Efforts to address the issue from the NGO sector, though, have been strong and consistent. Commenting on the upcoming Safer Gambling Week campaign, SkillOnNet sales and marketing director Michael Golembo said:</p>
<p>Safer gambling has always been a watchword for SkillOnNet and we have always expected the same of our EGO affiliate marketing partners. They have always done a great job of arming players with the tools and knowledge they need to make responsible decisions and informing them about resources available if gambling becomes a problem. SkillOnNet Michael Golembo</p>
<p>Driving Responsible Gambling Messages Even Harder</p>
<p>Golembo urged brands and partners to push that message even harder during the upcoming campaign. Numerous companies have been working hard on making gambling safer in the United Kingdom. GamCare announced itself against unaffordable lending and urged for more measures just recently.</p>
<p>The organization has not discriminated against individuals in society and has urged action in the criminal justice system where people are also very likely to suffer from gambling harm, but their problems often go unnoticed. Safer Gambling Week is a good opportunity to work and push for safer gambling on all strata of society.</p>
