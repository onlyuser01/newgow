<p>Legion X review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Legion X has a Roman-Gallic fantasy theme. Players enter a moody world filled with mythical heroes and masked villains. Blood splattered shields suggest this is no fairy tale, but a gritty epic.</p>
<p>Players will need to choose sides as Romans invade the British Isles.</p>
<p>Fans of Game of Thrones will enjoy this slot’s dark atmosphere and magical vibe. By the light of sparking torches, they’ll test their skills as warriors.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The cinematic soundtrack brings to mind classic fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings while haunting bird calls add an eerie ambiance. The reels land with the sound of stones falling into place, giving a natural feel to each spin.</p>
<p>On the reels, players encounter a soldier in a golden mask and another wearing the skull of a predator over his face. A young fighter wears the skull of a bull on her head, blood dripping down her cheek. Players will be left in no doubt that these warriors have seen their share of action.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see a fenced off camp, illuminated only by sputtering torches. Beyond the camp is a mysterious forest with fog drifting among the trees. This effective animation adds a mystic vibe to the setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a gritty fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Legion X reels have a 2-3-2-3-2 structure. This can increase to 4-3-2-3-4 during special features.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols anywhere on adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel and going right.</p>
<p>The pace of the gameplay is swift and attention-grabbing.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Stacked Wild symbols will nudge to full visibility when any part of them lands. Every nudge will increase the Wild’s multiplier by +1.</p>
<p>When Infectious Wild symbols land, they will transform a random low-paying symbol on the middle reels into Wild symbols. Infectious Wilds can only land on the first and last reel.</p>
<p>Should players land two Infectious Wild symbols, all low paying symbols on the middle reels will be transformed into Wilds.</p>
<p>The xWays symbols can transform into any symbol besides Wild symbols or Bonus symbols. xWays symbols only appear on the first and last reel, and will change into between 2 and 4 matching symbols. This will increase the potential for winning combinations.</p>
<p>If players land an xWays symbol and an Infectious Wild symbol, they will trigger a combination of the features — Infectious xWays will take effect and all low-paying symbols on the middle reels will turn into Wilds.</p>
<p>The Legion X Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols on the middle reels. Players begin with 8 free spins and the reels will increase in size with the first and last reel gaining a row. If players land a single xWays or Infectious Wild symbol, they will gain an additional spin.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Bonus symbols on the middle reels as well as 2 xWays symbols, the Legion of X Equestris Spins begins with 10 free spins. During this feature, the reels increase in size and xWays symbols will stick where they land.</p>
<p>The Legion X Fretensis Spins begins when players land 3 Bonus symbols on the middle reels along with 2 Infectious Wild symbols. The feature begins with 10 free spins as well as the reels increasing in size. The Infectious Wild symbols will stick where they land, converting all low-paying symbols into Wilds.</p>
<p>When players land 3 Bonus symbols on the middle reels, as well as on Infectious Wild and one xWays symbol, the Legion X Gemina Spins begins. The feature starts with 10 free spins and increasing reel size. Both Infectious Wilds and xWays symbols are sticky during this feature.</p>
<p>The maximum payout for Legion X is x31,000 the player’s total bet. If this amount is reached, the round will conclude.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.04%, just about our yardstick for average of roughly 96%. There is an option to buy into the various bonus rounds, in which case the RTP may differ slightly.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, high volatility Roman fantasy slot.</p>
<p>With its rugged Roman-Gallic theme and robust volatility, Legion X is a fun and strategy-friendly choice.</p>
<p>The game offers players a great number of Bonus features, creating variety and opportunities for engaging gameplay.</p>
