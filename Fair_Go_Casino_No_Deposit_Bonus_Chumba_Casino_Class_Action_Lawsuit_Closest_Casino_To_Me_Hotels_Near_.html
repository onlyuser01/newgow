<p>Gaming Innovation Group has announced that it is doubling down on its commitment to the North American market through the creation of a dedicated US hub that will be spearheaded by Ben Clemes. Clemes will step in as president of GiG North America and preside over the company’s future growth in the region at a time of a rapid regulatory push and expansion.</p>
<p>GiG Continues to Rotate Talent into the US and NA Markets</p>
<p>GiG embarked on its journey in the United States back in 2018 and has been powering a number of prominent brands across the country, notably Hard Rock in New Jersey. The company’s North American operations have been scaling up rapidly and GiG has also announced the launch of PlayStar, once again in New Jersey, and negotiated a successful deal in Crab Sports in Maryland, subject to regulatory approval and market launch.</p>
<p>GIG puts great store in the North American business and market and continues to invest heavily in the region in a bid to establish itself as a go-to iGaming platform for local partners and sports betting brands. GiG Media in the meantime has been licensed to operate in more than 19 states in the United States alone.</p>
<p>GiG also moved quickly in the regulated gaming market, buying out Sportnco, a sports betting platform, and has benefited from the company’s deep understanding and technological expertise in the sports wagering platform. Through this acquisition, GiG is now preparing to launch live with Crab Sports in Maryland. The creation of a dedicated US hub has been welcomed by GiG’s executive team.</p>
<p>GiG CEO Richard Brown confirmed that the company has strong aspirations for North America as part of the company’s global strategy. He added:</p>
<p>The integration of Sportnco and completion of our next generation of technology within the platform, the timing is perfect to further establish GiG operationally into the continent to capitalize on each and every opportunity. GiG CEO Richard Brown</p>
<p>He also welcomed Clemes’ addition whom he trusts to continue driving results for the company in this highly contested region and particular market. GiG Media CMO Jonas Warrer was equally excited at the prospect of having Clemes on the team as the company is making decisive strides in the United States.</p>
<p>Welcomed Opportunity to Help GiG Grow in NA</p>
<p>Warrer said that GiG has been able to cement itself in the market and region and intends to carry on as it continues to secure new milestones. Clemes himself was pleased with the opportunity to join the team and said that he was very inspired to help GiG pursue its US and North American aspirations.</p>
<p>“The timing is perfect, with the full integration of Sportnco into our next generation of platform technology developed specifically for the North American market,” he noted. He also said that his vast industry experience in European markets can now prove helpful in the newly regulated North American region.</p>
