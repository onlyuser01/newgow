<p>GamCare, an independent UK charity focusing on tackling gambling-related problems, published its latest set of recommendations addressing a particular issue among people who suffer from pathological gambling tendencies – debt.</p>
<p>Debt has continued to be a problem for many people, and particularly those who had sought help for their gambling, with six out of ten people having incurred gambling-related debt. Around 2% of people enrolled in treatment were considered insolvent – they have either filed for bankruptcy or for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, GamCare detailed in a post.</p>
<p>GamCare cautioned that there was a correlation between financial pressure and increase spending on gambling products, posing risk to vulnerable individuals who were struggling to control their gambling and level of debt. Because of this, GamCare said that there were significant risks of housing and even homelessness stemming from gambling activities.</p>
<p>All of this information was based on data collected by the National Gambling Treatment Service and part of GamCare’s series of workshops that addressed different aspects of problem gambling. The workshop was attended by 60 specialists who weighed in and offered advice and guidance on how to start addressing this particularly painful problem for many gamblers.</p>
<p>One of the key proposals was to create cross-sector partnerships that would allow gambling support, treatment services, and debt advice organizations to work together and ensure that vulnerable and suffering gamblers get adequate help. GamCare has confirmed that it has already started with the initial efforts to create such networks.</p>
<p>Treatment practitioners at GamCare already work with PayPlan, a leading debt advice provider based in the United Kingdom. The collaboration was elaborated on by Vulnerable Client Lead at PayPlan, Emma Gibbons, who said:</p>
<p>As part of our partnership, we have a specialist advice team in place who work closely with GamCare, ensuring a "tell us once", confidential and tailored approach to clients’ needs.</p>
<p>GamCare also received more insights from the workshop thanks to the lived experience of people who have recovered. Some participants explained that for people who are actively gambling, sticking to a debt repayment plan could be unrealistic. Dealing with gambling debt before dealing with problem gambling does not work participants explained.</p>
<p>Participants also spoke about whether the debt advising sector would benefit from blanket training on problem gambling and gambling awareness. Citizens Advice, one of the participating entities, also insisted that harmful gambling can lead to debt, and from there on – to relationship issues and housing.</p>
<p>The organization has already established a dedicated "Action on Gambling Harm" program which aims to train advisers to spot gambling harm in their clients. GamCare also published its full list of recommendations for interested parties to explore in full at their leisure.</p>
