<p>With the arrival of the Dutch gambling market, companies have all queued up to be among the first to provide their services and secure a share of the regulated pie. Now, the Netherlands Lottery or NLO has partnered with Scientific Games for the latter’s OpenGaming and OpenBet platforms that deliver on thorough iGaming and interactive wagering experiences.</p>
<p>NLO Welcomes Scientific Games as Its Partner</p>
<p>The move is even more valuable to Scientific Games when you factor in the number of brands the NLO operates under its brand, including Eurojackpot, Miljoenenspel, Lucky Day, TOTO, Scratch Cards, and Staatsloterij.</p>
<p>The company had tailored its platforms in a way that fully complies with the newly-regulated market that has been five years in the making prior to October 1, when it officially launched. Commenting on this journey and the recent partnership, Scientific Gaming VP commercial of iGaming Andy Stubley welcomed the opportunity to be delivering the company’s content aggregator and platform to the newly-regulated Dutch market.</p>
<p>“We have high expectations that OpenGaming will perform well in this key European region and look forward to delivering entertaining iGaming experiences to players across the country,” Stubley explained.</p>
<p>At the same time, the NLO is confident that it will benefit vastly from the partnership as it would have access to a scalable betting platform that allows consumers to benefit from trading services along with various other sports analyses, including pre-game and in-play selections as well as risk management services.</p>
<p>Creating a Versatile Regulated Gaming Product</p>
<p>Scientific Games is also rolling its OpenGaming platform with the NLO’s iGaming brand, TOTO, which will allow the company to power the newly-regulated iGaming offer. According to TOTO business director for sportsbook and casino Sam Depoortere, the company is thrilled at the opportunity.</p>
<p>“Over the coming months and years, we are in a strong position to attract a wide audience thanks to our premium product portfolio of sports and gaming,” Depoortere added. He was joined by OpenBet VP sports product Nikols Konstakis reaffirmed the platform’s mission, which is to consistently deliver on regulated sports betting products and deliver even more opportunities for consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to our partner Nederlandse Loterij and with our full technology stack and content proposition, together we will bring unmissable sports betting experiences for Dutch players,” Konstakis concluded, referring to the careful planning the Netherlands undertook before launching its regulated iGaming market.</p>
<p>There have been several big moves on the Dutch market, apart from operators entering. After the first ten operators were announced, several companies said that they would suspend any operations in the country in a bid to prepare for a fully-regulated entry into the newly fledged market.</p>
