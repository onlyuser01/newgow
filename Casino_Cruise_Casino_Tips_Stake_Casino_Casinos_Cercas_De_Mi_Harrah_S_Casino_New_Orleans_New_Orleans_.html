<p>Vlad's Castle review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>At first glance, it looks like Eyecon build Vlad’s Castle with the Francis Ford Coppola adaptation of Dracula in mind, as evidenced by Vlad’s ludicrous hairstyle in both properties.</p>
<p>The association between Dracula and Vlad the Impaler is by now a key part of pop-culture’s wider take on Bram Stoker’s villainous creation, and this game uses that to give us vampyre bats, frantic pale-faced maidens and plenty of Gothic underlighting.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of the Gothic tradition, this will fit right in with your tastes.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are well put together and each symbol has a small animation when involved in a win. The background is deep red wallpaper lit by flickering candles. The win lines are all demarcated with a lovely thread of red light and the reel spins have a pleasing heft to them.</p>
<p>The sound is a fantastic bit of Gothic movie soundtrack pastiche which clashes somewhat with the rather standard sound effects on the reels. Well worth cranking the music up for that spooky atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The main game is a five by three, twenty-five win line slot. You can opt to play anywhere from one to twenty-five win lines.</p>
<p>There are a few bonus features, described below, to keep you interested but no mini-games or gamble feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>This slot has two special symbols. The Wild symbol and the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol, and doubles the amount of any winnings when used to make a winning line.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol will also trigger a Free Spin bonus if you manage to land three or more. You win fifteen, twenty or twenty-five free spins for three, four or five Wilds respectively. During the Free Spin bonus prizes are tripled.</p>
<p>Free Spins can be retriggered up to fifteen times.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol triggers the Portrait Feature if you get three or more symbols. For each Scatter in the winning combination, you get to click one portrait. Each portrait contains a randomised prize which is added to your winnings. The random prizes are up to 100x your bet per spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.39%. This is a bit low, coming in under the yardstick we use of about 96% for average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was $/£/€0.25 per spin up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin if you played every line. If you play just one win line you can go as low as $/£/€0.01 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>A fun and spooky take on the Dracula legend in slot form, Vald’s Castle is pretty and comes with great music.</p>
<p>We like the high volatility and the movie reference theme, but the vig is a little high.</p>
<p>Overall we would not warn you off this one, but you might want to shop around a bit unless it really seems your bag.</p>
