<p>Globally recognized Indian esports organization, Revenant Esports, announced it expanded its Valorant roster by adding a seasoned veteran with plenty of experience and unique skills. Last week, Revenant Esports revealed it added Tejas Sawant to its Valorant roster.</p>
<p>As a Valorant veteran with a proven track record, Sawant, also famous as "rite2ace," brings unique skills to Revenant Esports. His addition follows another boost that the team's Valorant roster received after only recently adding Sahil "1TaPGoD" Duble.</p>
<p>Counting Sawant and Double, the organization's Valorant team now has seven players that include Shailesh "blackhawk" Dalvi, Saaransh "Whimp" Dang, Enrico "Ching" Perez, Joshua "JoshS" Santos and Kasif "Paradox" Sayyed. On the other hand, Yoon "Malix" Kyung-ho is currently the Head Coach for Revenant Esports' Valorant roster.</p>
<p>In a statement received via email, Sawant said that it is exciting to join Revenant Esports' team. He acknowledged that the organization's Valorant roster has seen rapid growth. "I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Valorant with my previous organization and look forward to this new chapter of my career," Sawant added.</p>
<p>Moreover, he explained that he plans to leverage his extensive experience and help the team continue to score wins and solidify its top-tier position. Finally, Sawant said: "I cannot wait to meet my new teammates and rigorously practice as well as formulate strategies for the major tournaments in store."</p>
<p>Besides Valorant, Sawant also played CS:GO professionally. Before joining Revenant Esports, he was a part of Team Velocity Gaming. While a part of that team, last year, Sawant won the TEC Challenger Series, VCC 2022: Stage 1 as well as Skyesports Pro Invitational. Throughout the Skyesports Pro Invitational S2 he had an impressive record with a K/D ratio of 1.14 and accumulated 233 kills and 89 assists.</p>
<p>Rohit Jagasia, Revenant Esports Founder and CEO, was also excited about the recent announcement. He explained that the team is delighted to see Sawant join its growing esports family. "Everyone in the Esports community is well aware of his name and the signing of such a high-profile player is going to strengthen our team," added Jagasia.</p>
<p>According to him, the popularity of Valorant continues to grow in India. Jagasia explained that the addition of Sawant complements the growth of Revenant Esports' Valorant roster and its goal of becoming a leading team for the game. "I am confident that we are going to achieve immense success with Sawant in the team and would like to wish our entire roster all the best for the upcoming tournaments," he said in conclusion.</p>
