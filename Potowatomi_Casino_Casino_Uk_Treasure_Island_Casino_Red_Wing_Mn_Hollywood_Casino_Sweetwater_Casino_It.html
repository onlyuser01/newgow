<p>Fagioli, 22, found himself in hot water after breaching Article 24 of the Sporting Justice Code, which strictly prohibits players from placing bets on soccer matches organized by FIGC, UEFA, and FIFA</p>
<p>Juventus midfielder Nicolò Fagioli has been suspended from soccer for seven months by the Italian Soccer Federation (FIGC) due to violations related to illegal betting.</p>
<p>FIGC Confirms Fagioli’s Suspension and Therapy Plan</p>
<p>The FIGC confirmed the suspension following a probe led by Turin prosecutors. Fagioli’s punishment, initially set at a 12-month ban, was mitigated due to his immediate admission of guilt and his cooperation with the authorities. His ban was further reduced to seven months thanks to a plea bargain with the FIGC, which included a fine of €12,500.</p>
<p>The young midfielder’s suspension was not just limited to time away from the pitch. As part of the agreement, Fagioli will undergo a six-month therapy plan aimed at addressing his gambling addiction. Additionally, he is required to participate in a series of public meetings, totaling at least ten, to be held within the next five months. These meetings will take place at various venues, including amateur sports clubs and centers dedicated to helping individuals recovering from gambling dependence.</p>
<p>Fagioli’s case is part of a broader investigation into illegal betting websites, with Premier League players Sandro Tonali and Nicolò Zaniolo also under scrutiny. Fagioli’s prompt reporting of the issue and his cooperation with the authorities led to a more lenient punishment. In contrast, Tonali and Zaniolo, whose cases are not as advanced, are still awaiting their fate.</p>
<p>Italy’s soccer stars Zaniolo and Tonali are under investigation by the FIGC for their alleged involvement in online betting through illegal operators. The investigation, related to illegal betting, prompted the players’ removal from the national team’s training camp, with concerns rising about sports integrity amidst the rapid growth of sports betting.</p>
<p>FIGC President Advocates Support for Players Struggling with Gambling Addiction</p>
<p>FIGC President Gabriele Gravina stressed the significance of providing assistance to players facing challenges related to gambling addiction. He mentioned that to him, these players are akin to children and should not be left vulnerable to the consequences of their struggles.</p>
<p>Gravina pointed out that gambling addiction is a widespread issue in Italy, affecting not only the realm of Italian soccer but also the broader society. He noted the alarming statistics, indicating that out of 5.1 million individuals engaged in gambling, 1.5 million are enduring the hardships of addiction. Gravina expressed his lack of surprise that some of these individuals are involved in soccer, underlining the pervasive nature of the problem.</p>
<p>While Fagioli’s suspension is undoubtedly a blow to Juventus, it is hoped that the mandated therapy and support will assist him in overcoming his gambling addiction.</p>
