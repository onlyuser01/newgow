    <h1>Free Vegas Casino Slots Hard Rock Hotel Casino Las Vegas Juwa Casino Download Hooters Casino Hotel C</h1>

<p>I see ~ I was surprised that KYC took a month, but I think I'll wait if I have to wait!</p>
<p>However, it wouldn't be strange for the casino to contact me once in about two weeks, right?</p>
<p>(Honestly, I don't think I'll be able to lower the amount if it takes this long...)</p>
<p>I think it depends on the country, but at least in Japan, waiting quietly for almost a month (although it hasn't been set up yet) without contact will give a strong impression that trust is dulled (almost untrustworthy).</p>
<p>I hope you understand...</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I was sent an advertisement in Japanese, but when it became related to KYC, I was sent an advertisement in English that had nothing to do with Hei tereira! Melt! I couldn't get rid of the image of being taken lightly (made stupid) like this...</p>
<p>I also played with Mr. Eldoah, but I paid out about 30,000 to 40,000...</p>
<p>It was really a quick withdrawal... Such a casino</p>
<p>I was really impressed that it was a top-notch online casino! If you get the image that it will go smoothly only when you deposit and only when you withdraw money (we will consider the first review)... Honestly, I think that players will inevitably leave! I think that deposit and withdrawal problems are common to all casinos for any reason</p>
<p>I think that a casino that can't do that well can be considered a 5th-rate casino! (It's tough... Players who leave once never come back to that casino! This is the reality.) Are you willing to come back and play at a casino where you can or can't withdraw?</p>
