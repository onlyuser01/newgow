<p>Parden bad Grammer misspelling contest punctuation guessüëã</p>
<p>Few things online gaming sites do that earatate the üëπout of us, ü•∂ when 99 out of a hundred times weve experienced the reality of defeat</p>
<p>Upset is when good luck finally hits</p>
<p>then taken away from play</p>
<p>Red Anger</p>
<p>Is all I have to say.</p>
<p>For example when given a free 25$ token with rules printed on it and instructions of what one should do with it, isnt that exciting, you'll already know not going to win isn't that already a given the odds stacked against the player at start?</p>
<p>Butt now they need to do the free scam,</p>
<p>its free with stipulations in real life</p>
<p>You'll need 3500 hundred play thru</p>
<p>and don't forget 8 hours of time.</p>
<p>The chip is valid as currency in all ways,</p>
<p>except the good machines</p>
<p>no payouts over a hundred even if played for days.</p>
<p>This isn't just ranting and raving</p>
<p>a little evidence to back up the claim</p>
<p>as GC used to say America the great,</p>
<p>But theres some SAMF in this country.</p>
<p>Seriously if you give someone a 25$ free chip</p>
<p>it should be out of the casinos concern what we do with it.</p>
<p>I would be a piece of crap trying to Regulate GIFTS to the HOMELESS HERES a twenty with a list on how to spend it.</p>
<p>Let's talk free spins? Our language free spins means free spins, no money deposited, and we keep whats won, no obstacles common sense man.</p>
<p>Today is opposite in</p>
<p>Casino language</p>
<p>free spins is regulations, controlled limitations, manipulations, misinformations, false advertising to boots,</p>
<p>The shit is piling up folks.</p>
<p>Tonight invited to vipslots casino</p>
<p>Trying the new GZ üê≤ verses KingK 75 FREE no deposit spins.</p>
<p>Had a blast fun machine took over an hour to clear 75 spins made a hundred bucks so I thought yet the second finished spinning an error pops up freezing the game and winnings taken away. Without explanation unless small talk prints.</p>
<p>Those 75 free spins turned into a deposit hostage</p>
<p>of course we know nothings really free.</p>
<p>This may be fine and Dandy but for us its easier not visiting vipslots then complaining about it..</p>
<p>The new way is integrity</p>
<p>with in everything we do,</p>
<p>to be so greedy take back</p>
<p>something free</p>
<p>Is dangerously near</p>
<p>hypocrisy</p>
<p>Its shameful</p>
<p>Degrading at best.</p>
<p>When the rules become no rules eventually the others would follow suit or go out of business only when integrity is normal and compassion is fundamental greed wouldn't be in the equation.</p>
<p>Last example if a phone company like AT&amp;T said they</p>
<p>will never cut off service for any reason even for none payment it would monopolize the industry.</p>
<p>If 1 online gambling forum stoped being cheap and stingy and just allowed people the chance of the chance they think there getting so much more money than the old pattern of memememineminemine.üèß</p>
