    <h1>Potawatomi Casino Milwaukee Wisconsin Casino Map Red Rock Casino Buffet Foxwood Casino Hotel Lightni</h1>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I’d like to file a complaint against crazy when it’s casino. This complaint is serious on many levels.</p>
<p>I’ve been struggling with a gambling addiction for the past year and a half and I am trying to get out of it. It’s not as easy as it seems to me. The best way I try to get out of this addiction ( because I can’t seem to do it myself) He’s by asking the casinos to give me no option to re-open my account. And tell them I am a compulsive gambler and I want them to just follow the rules and help people like me.</p>
<p>With that said this one has been scariest of all. His name is James Smiths and I believe he is in charge of this casino. He has worked for other casinos and has called me many times during the past year even though I have asked for no phone calls.</p>
<p>he emailed me in July telling me to come to crazy winners that it’s the best casino around. I wrote him back saying please don’t bother me anymore. No phone calls no emails and I am not interested.</p>
<p>Last week I get a call from James and I answered it because I did not recognize his number. He talked about my gambling addiction but told me I would definitely win at his casino…So on so forth. He told me that I always get money back when I lose.</p>
<p>I played at his casino and then again I wanted to close the account and asked for new options to reopen and I asked for no more phone calls from James. First of all they didn’t close my account and then James called me. I did not answer the phone because now I know his number. I will to the host manager and I asked her to please I do not want phone calls from him anymore.I’m a senior citizen and I know he’s upset that I close my account but I’m worried about retribution. Please help</p>
