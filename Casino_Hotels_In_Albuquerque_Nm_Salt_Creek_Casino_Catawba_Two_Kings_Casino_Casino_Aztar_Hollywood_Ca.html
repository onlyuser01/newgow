    <h1>Casino Hotels In Albuquerque Nm Salt Creek Casino Catawba Two Kings Casino Casino Aztar Hollywood Ca</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>So I've been waiting almost 7 days for an answer like this?</p>
<p>They don't seem to understand the problem at all.</p>
<p>I don't expect a bad rating from the casino as punishment, I expect a realistic rating. They rate Responsible Gaming Tools as "very good" in their review of the casino. The casino does not adhere to responsible gaming. So it can't be "very good". It would be VERY GOOD if it would also comply with the set deposit limits.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, there are currently no uniform regulations that would apply to all casinos..."</p>
<p>Again, the casino increased a set limit several times within the set period. Do not you understand?</p>
<p>I set a limit, for example 7 days deposit limit 500 euros, after day 1 500 euros are already deposited. So now any deposit must be rejected by the end of the 7 days or at least a deadline (normally 24 hours) must be set for the increase. Because otherwise a deposit limit has no function at all and is pointless for responsible gaming. Then how can you state in your report that responsible gaming is "very well" implemented there?</p>
<p>Why set a deposit limit, which can be increased arbitrarily within the set period of time within 10 seconds? You have to understand that this falls short when it comes to responsible gaming. Or not?</p>
<p>"However, if it works while it was active and you still need to take an extra step to mitigate the limit, there is nothing we can do about it, we cannot penalize you if..."</p>
<p>The limit was increased to 1600 euros on the day, although a limit was set at 387 euros. Of course, you can't dictate what a casino should do or penalize, but you have to change your rating in Responsible Gaming if you still want to take your own ratings seriously. If you simply write reports that are not true, then please let your users know about it. *Note, our reviews are fictitious or something.</p>
<p>The last thing I have to say is that a casino that refuses any contact for 9 days must be classified as dubious. It's not a punishment, but if you take your own work seriously, you need to include that in your report. Communication with the casino is poor. You have to tell your users that.</p>
<p>If a casino offers responsible gaming and doesn't comply, you can't write that responsible gaming is "very good" at that casino.</p>
<p>I can only hope that you have now finally understood the problem. Close this case without changing these things in your casino review, ridicule your own work.</p>
<p>They would expose their reviews to ridicule.</p>
