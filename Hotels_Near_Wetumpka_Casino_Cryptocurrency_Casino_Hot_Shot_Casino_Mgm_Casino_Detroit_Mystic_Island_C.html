<p>In less than a year since the launch of Relax Gaming's Dream Drop Jackpots, seven different people have secured seven-figure prizes</p>
<p>The much-anticipated Dream Drop Jackpots mechanic was introduced by Relax Gaming back in May 2022. The company’s Temple Tumble 2 Dream Drop was the first game to offer the innovative mechanic that grants players a chance to win a progressive jackpot by landing six Dream Drop symbols during a special jackpot entry spin that is triggered randomly.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the mechanic, it has proven highly popular and in fact, less than a year after its launch, made seven people millionaires. It was last month when a lucky Dream Drop Jackpot winner playing Temple Tumble 2 via White Hat Gaming’s platform secured a win of nearly $2 million.</p>
<p>Now, Relax Gaming confirmed that Temple Tumble 2 Dream Drop made another player a millionaire. The lucky person played the game via Kindred’s Unibet platform when they scored a life-changing award of $2.4 million ($2.57 million). The player placed a €1.27 ($1.35) wager, which ultimately granted him the eye-popping €2,408,389 ($2,568,462) jackpot. That lucky player became the seventh one to secure a seven-digit win from Relax Gaming’s leading game.</p>
<p>The recent jackpot win reaffirms further the success of Relax Gaming’s leading mechanic. In fact, the company was recently recognized during the EGR B2B Awards as the Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider. Additionally, Relax Gaming secured a Casino / Slot Developer of the Year award during the SBC Awards.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Deliver Exciting Experiences and Huge Prizes</p>
<p>Kindred Group’s director casino and gaming, David Robertson, said that it is always exciting to see players secure life-changing awards by using the company’s platform. Moreover, he pointed out that Relax Gaming’s innovative content is engaging and well-received by the players. Finally, Robertson said that the big wins “will only enhance the satisfaction that players have for the Dream Drop titles.”</p>
<p>“We have only scratched the surface with this mechanic as there are a number of fantastic Dream Drop Jackpot titles coming to casinos this year and we’re excited to see this winning momentum continue at pace.“ Simon Hammon, CEO at Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s CEO, added that the latest seven-figure jackpot reaffirms the success of the company’s mechanic. At the same time, he pointed out that online players enjoy Relax Gaming’s content which is overwhelming to see.</p>
<p>Hammon added that the jackpots won recently mark only the initial success of the mechanic and confirmed that there will be new Dream Drop Jackpot games arriving for online gambling operators this year. Finally, he said that it will be exciting to see how the new games will be received by the players.</p>
