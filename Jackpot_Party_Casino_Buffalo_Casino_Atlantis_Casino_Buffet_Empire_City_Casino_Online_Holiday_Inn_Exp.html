    <h1>Jackpot Party Casino Buffalo Casino Atlantis Casino Buffet Empire City Casino Online Holiday Inn Exp</h1>

<p>After several months of waiting and guessing, casino companies and interested parties finally have some of their answers about New York’s upcoming casino licenses. In a 103-page document dubbed Round 1 – Questions and Answers, the New York Gaming Facility Location Board addressed some of the hot questions.</p>
<p>Going over a whopping 613 questions, the board provided some clarity on the subject. For reference, the original questions were submitted back in February.</p>
<p>Questions range in importance but some of them answer some of the hottest questions about the licenses. The board, for example, said that a license fee would be at a minimum of $500 million. It added that applicants can submit a higher sum if they wish. In addition, the document says that a facility must cost at least $500 million to build.</p>
<p>The board also clarified that licenses can vary in validity up to a maximum of 10 years. The length of a license, as well as other terms, will depend on the value of the applicants’ proposals compared to those of their competitors.</p>
<p>Another major confirmation is that the three recipients of the downstate casino licenses will be allowed to incorporate a sportsbook into their property.</p>
<p>Companies Have a Month to Read the Answers and Submit More Questions</p>
<p>Casino companies interested in grabbing one of New York’s three available casino licenses now have around a month to read through the New York Gaming Facility Location Board’s answers to their questions. During that time, casino companies can also pose a second round of questions.</p>
<p>By October 6, casino operators can ask additional questions and demand clarifications on the answers in the Round 1 document. Following that the board will return to answering questions. However, the body provided no indication as to when Round 2 – Questions and Answers may be released.</p>
<p>The New York Race Is as Heated as Ever</p>
<p>Casino companies are likely to spend hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars during the race for a casino license. In addition to the license fees and minimum facility costs, companies will also have to spend money on promoting their projects over those of their competitors.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, many companies consider New York to be a “worthwhile prize” because of the myriad of opportunities it provides. Because of that, Silverstein and Greenwood entered the race two months ago.</p>
