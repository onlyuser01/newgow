    <h1>Casino 1995 Casino Adrenaline Resort World Casino Sycuan Casino Resort Syracuse Casino Yabby Casino</h1>

<p>no when they deactivated my account to gigure out what happened on the game that I reported to them and they said If I can’t figure out my own issue even though I don’t have access to that and they know that and I told them that they were gonna have to figure it out what happened which is what it supposed to happen to begin with they have a deactivate my account till further investigation because the game could be detrimental to the casino. They never wants the activated the game itself that’s when I started in the pissed And I told them I’m not even worried about the $20 no more like I never thought it was gonna come to be this stupid of a situation. I have not been able to get back into my account since I first reported the issue. So I got no money returned to my account for whatever was wrong and they said it was unfounded claims and that they gave me a free chip which never happened because I’ve never been able to log back in to be able to play it still continue to say deactivated right at this moment because they were supposed to figure out what happened and then activate my account. Everything is in the proof in the emails. This is bigger than the $20 that I would’ve gave right back to the casino I’m sure this is about how are you going to treat somebody like that. I can see if I didn’t send you any email or any proof and this was all just hearsay. You need to make them explain why did I get deactivated for reporting an issue that I’m supposed to do isn’t that what I’m supposed to do? There’s no way in good faith you can honestly tell somebody after reading those emails that you can even remotely promote this site. What if somebody’s on here pulling like $20 a spin and something like this happens then what is it gonna happen As soon as this individual reports it. How is it if there’s a glitch in the game and I accidentally paid you a whole bunch of money even though you don’t know what they’re really telling you is the truth how is that OK but when it’s the other way around I get deactivated. I’m just gonna leave it at this, I haven’t been able to get back into my account since they deactivated it since day one until further investigation and they claim they gave me a chip which isn’t true because I’ve never been able to log back in. Like I can’t even believe I’m still sitting here having to have this discussion do you have the email you see what’s going on you see that I did nothing wrong, money or no money rather than take me back or not you can still leave them as a battery view and not recommend them I can’t even believe we’re still having this discussion when you have all the proof. It doesn’t all have to be all money but if you wanna make it about money at least it will be like $20. You clearly see me so you know what just take it back, I didn’t start getting mad until I realized that they deactivated my account but never deactivated the game that I recorded that was supposed to be so detrimental to the casino if there something wrong!! So you report one of their games and do the right thing and nice about it and doing it for the casinos favor in case it’s somebody who spending a lot of money on here and this happens to you and you tell me it could be detrimental to the casino but I get deactivated and the game Paddy’sLucky Forest doesn’t!! There’s nothing else to talk about money or no money having an account or them not taking me back I don’t see how in good faith you could ever recommend this place to anybody. My service one more time I gave you guys the damn proof!! You tell me what I did wrong, how about that. Maybe you should ask them is that a common thing you just deactivate peoples account who do the right thing and report a glitch on one of their games and tell them they have to figure it out or they’re going to be deactivated, and you can say Yabby is that how are you do business? and their response right then and there should let you know everything you need to know and leave them in having a bad review regardless episode or not regardless they ever take me back regardless if they ever find my account the $20 back, they need to be stuck into a bad review because they went the wrong way about this and they’re still continuing to go the wrong way about this. I DID NOTHING WRONG, LITERAY!!!!!!!!! It’s time to do the right thing and put Yabby Casino’s feet to the fire. And also let them know in good faith that they cannot recommend their site to anybody until this is fixed because I didn’t do anything wrong. I mean there’s nothing else to say about it, it is what it is. I haven’t been able to get back into my account even after telling them I’m not worry about the $20 anymore since day one so that answers your question I can’t record anything at why you have all the emails that explains what’s going on from me talking to them in them talking to me at all right there I don’t understand!!</p>
