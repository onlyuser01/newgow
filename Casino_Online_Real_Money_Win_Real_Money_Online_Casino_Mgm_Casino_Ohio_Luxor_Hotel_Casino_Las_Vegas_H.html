<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino is a new casino that launched in 2020 and has been on the radar with some very tempting offers. The website’s launch quickly sent ripples, and the brand itself proved to be a trusted choice with high standards for safety and security.</p>
<p>Players can enjoy Las Atlantis Casino from multiple devices and platforms, including mobile, instant play, and desktop, and the casino is compatible with Android as well as Apple iOS software. This quickly positions the brand as an accessible online casino that brings excellent options for its players.</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino is powered by Realtime Gaming, licensed by Curacao, and tested by CDS and Technical Systems Testing (TST) for overall site fairness, safety, and reliability. The casino has plenty to offer, and our Las Atlantis Casino review starts at the top.</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino UI and UX</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino has a remarkable and intuitive user interface (UI) and overall user experience (UX). The casino is built on HTML5 to accommodate mobile players and provide quick access to the full site features. Navigation is quick to the touch and helps you reach your destination quickly.</p>
<p>Las Atlantis is owned by Infinity Media Group LTD, which has hosted other respected online casino brands such as Red Dog Casino, Slots Empire, and El Royale. With this website, though, Infinity Media has taken things up a notch, creating a platform fully prepared for the mobile iGaming age.</p>
<p>The titles available here are provided by Realtime Gaming, which is responsible for the overall casino software. We expect to see more excellent studios added to the list of what is already 200 games at Las Atlantis.</p>
<p>Customer support is quick and helpful, and you may get in touch via email, live chat, or phone number. The casino will even increase your deposit and withdrawal levels if you are a VIP player. One minor thing we didn’t immediately take to was the fact that you may only transact $2,500 per transaction prior to hitting a VIP status with the casino.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Las Atlantis Casino is solid, and we will explain why in the lines below. Check out our full review of Las Atlantis Online Casino and what it brings to the iGaming table.</p>
<p>Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino is a remarkable website that has successfully built a mobile-friendly and lightsome atmosphere. Players will immediately notice the quality of the overall website, just like they would quickly spot the 280% welcome offer waiting for them. If you want to find out more about the welcome bonus and the available promotions, stick with us.</p>
<p>280% Welcome Bonus up to $14,000</p>
<p>Las Atlantis will welcome you to a massive 280% welcome package worth up to $14,000. To claim the bonus, all you need to do is a deposit to meet the minimum amount, which will range from $10 to $30 depending on the payment method you prefer using. For Bitcoin deposits, you will be able to activate the bonus with $20. Here is a quick overview for your benefit: Neosurf $10, Bitcoin $20, Gift Cards $25, and Credit Cards $30.</p>
<p>There is also a Las Atlantis promo code, LASATLANTIS, that must be entered in order to activate the bonus. Then, you will have to wager the bonus+deposit amount 35x, clear your winnings and see if you want to withdraw your funds or keep playing. There are many excellent promotions to choose from beyond the welcome bonus, too, and we have featured those in our casino review.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there are even more welcome bonuses at Las Atlantis Casino, and you can choose from all of them. Below is a quick reference to all the available bonuses that you can pick instead of the $14,000 hard cash. They mostly feature free spins.</p>
<p>260% + 40 Free Spins: Use promo code: LAWELCOME</p>
<p>300% Slots Bonus: Use promo code: BERMUDA</p>
<p>260% + 60 Free Spins: Use promo code: TREASURECHEST</p>
<p>75 Free Spins: Use promo code: PEARLDIVING</p>
<p>280% + 50 Free Spins: Use promo code: LASCOIN</p>
<p>Las Atlantis makes a point of letting you choose the welcome bonus you feel most comfortable with. Players can scoop up free spins and use them on a range of casino games, or opt straight for the cash bonus and see how far they can make it!</p>
<p>Game of the Month and New Game Bonus</p>
<p>New games at Las Atlantis Casino are a pretty frequent occurrence. For this reason, you can expect to see many fresh casino games appear in the portfolio. To celebrate each addition to its casino, Las Atlantis allocates a small bonus. When we reviewed the casino, Las Atlantis was promoting Lucky Catch Slot by Realtime Gaming.</p>
<p>The bonus was a tempting 120% + 25 Free Spins. Because the casino believes in giving players a lot of options, it also offers several other bonus options like 150% + 35 Free Spins and 180% + 45 Free Spins for those who are prepared to deposit a little more.</p>
<p>Naturally, there is zero obligation for you to participate in any of the new game bonuses. If you do have a title that you like, though, you can cover the minimum deposit and use some bonus funds to make your experience even more worthwhile. We used promo code FALSEALARM to get a taste of the game and bonus ourselves.</p>
<p>Casino Games at Las Atlantis Online Casino</p>
<p>For those of you looking to have a bit of fun, Las Atlantis has made sure that there are at least 300 casino games to try, developed by Realtime Gaming. The offer is solid, with many different games listed at the casino and waiting to be explored. We can promise you that they are mobile-friendly, feel quick to the touch, and are a lot of fun to play. You can always start with the demo games, which are available for the majority of titles included in the casino. Let’s check out what real money casino games Las Atlantis has listed here.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino features 216 dedicated slot games by Realtime Gaming that you can explore on your own time and have a blast playing. These games come with some outstanding payout potentials, and you will find numerous options, including Cash Bandits 2, Bubble Bubble, Asgard, Count Spectacular, Enchanted Garden II, Gemtopia, and others. All slots are available for Demo Play, and you can shop around for the ones you love best, whether you factor in the theme, gameplay mechanics, or payouts.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker is another excellent genre to treat yourself to. Las Atlantis Casino has 17 distinct versions that you can try as demo games or simply join for real money if you have the raw skills to pull it off. You will find great titles, including Bonus Deuces Wild, Bonus Poker Deluxe, Double Jackpot Poker, Double Double Bonus Poker, Jacks or Better, Joker Poker, and others. The average payout for video poker games at Las Atlantis Casino is 99%.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>For those of you who prefer table games, Las Atlantis Casino will not disappoint. There are 13 dedicated titles from various genres to make sure that you have an excellent experience. The casino site features titles such as Craps, European Roulette, Pai Gow Poker, Tri Card Poker, Vegas Three Card Rummy, Red Dog, and others.</p>
<p>You will have access to Let’em Ride, Baccarat, Caribbean Hold’em, and more. Most of these games can be easily played based on a popular strategy, but you still need to be mindful of the house edge. Overall, Las Atlantis games have some of the most generous casino house edges.</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack is without a doubt the game that US players love to play just as much as poker games. Las Atlantis Online Casino has made sure that you have access to six outstanding choices when it comes to blackjack, including:</p>
<p>21 Blackjack</p>
<p>European Blackjack</p>
<p>21 Face Up</p>
<p>Match Play 21</p>
<p>Perfect Pairs</p>
<p>Pontoon</p>
<p>Suit ’em Up</p>
<p>Super 21</p>
<p>Specialty Games: Las Atlantis Own Specials</p>
<p>If you are a little tired of standard gameplay, Las Atlantis Specialty Games seem to be the right choice for you. The casino brings some outstanding titles listed here, including Fish Catch, Bonus Bingo, and Bananas Jones. Interestingly, you will also find French Roulette, Hot Dice, Keno, and Magic 7’s.</p>
<p>Live Dealer Casino: Coming Soon?</p>
<p>Las Atlantis Casino may have one fatal flaw, and that is the lack of live dealer casino software. Yet, players are still happy to join Las Atlantis even if live casino options are not available last time we checked. A prime candidate for some outstanding live dealer games would be Visionary iGaming (ViG), which is available on Infinity Media’s other casinos. While we wait for live casino games to arrive at Las Atlantis though, you have outstanding bonuses to enjoy and various other promotions to explore.</p>
<p>HTML5 Optimized Mobile Casino</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Las Atlantis Casino is optimized as a mobile casino. Everything from the way you interact with the user interface to the games is clearly optimized in a way that allows you to enjoy a flawless gaming experience on the go. A new online casino, such as Las Atlantis, has to make an impression on its player base, and mobile compatibility is definitely a feather in its cap.</p>
<p>Players will find the casino to be fully compatible with their smartphones, tablets, and other devices that add to a diverse selection of games that are going to be worth your while. All banking features have been optimized to deposit and withdraw with a few taps. Android and iOS operating systems are supported, and you can equally play from Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>How to Register and Get Started at Las Atlantis Casino</p>
<p>Getting yourself started at Las Atlantis Casino is a straightforward task. Just like most online casinos, the casino will invite you to register first by visiting the homepage and locating the registration page. This is a simple enough process.</p>
<h1>1 Click on the Sign-Up Button</h1>
<p>Once you start the sign-up process, it will go smoothly. You will be asked to pick your username and enter a password, as well as put down an email. Once you do, you will proceed with providing some basic details about yourself, such as your gender, first and last name, and date of birth. Then, you will be asked to enter information about your address and country of origin. Once this is sorted, you can click on the Complete registration.</p>
<h1>2 Make a Deposit</h1>
<p>Now that you have an account up and running (do not forget to confirm your email), you are ready to play, well – almost. The next thing you must do is place the minimum deposit the casino requires before you can access any real money games. Naturally, you can still enjoy free slots, table games, video poker, and other options.</p>
<h1>3 Claim a Welcome Bonus</h1>
<p>Since you are going to make a deposit anyway, it makes perfect sense to use this opportunity and also claim a welcome bonus. Las Atlantis is unique in that it allows you to actually pick a welcome package that you enjoy better. Besides, if you choose the “right” banking methods, you will get a small bonus extra, which will make your deposit even more worthwhile.</p>
