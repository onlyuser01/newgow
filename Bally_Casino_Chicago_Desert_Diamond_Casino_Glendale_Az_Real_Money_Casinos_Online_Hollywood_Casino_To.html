<p>Kindred Group sees the launch of its platform in New Jersey as the stepping stone for its North American expansion</p>
<p>Kindred Group announced today that it has received final approval for its proprietary gaming platform in New Jersey and is preparing to go live in mid-May before rolling it out across North America.</p>
<p>Preparing to Launch</p>
<p>The final approval granted to Kindred Group by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) will allow the group to introduce its proprietary gaming platform and elevate the customer experience, improve the quality of analytical data and raise the level of flexibility.</p>
<p>Commenting on the key development, Henrik Tjärnström, chief executive officer of Kindred Group, was pleased that the company would soon be able to launch its proprietary platform in New Jersey, feeling proud of everyone at Kindred and the collective effort that made the launch possible.</p>
<p>“Introducing the Kindred platform to our customers in New Jersey will provide the entertainment and experience enjoyed by our customers in Europe,” Tjärnström said, stressing that the company will finally be able to showcase its Unibet product, and also thankful to the regulator for “a professional collaboration during the approval process.”</p>
<p>Following the approval, Kindred Group is expected to debut its gaming platform in New Jersey in mid-May and then continually improve its functionalities. The New Jersey launch is seen as an important step toward the platform’s rollout across North American gaming jurisdictions and strengthening the group’s footprint in the US.</p>
<p>Kinder Group is planning to expand its proprietary platform into Pennsylvania next, with the launch in the Keystone State planned for the second business quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Unibet’s US Presence</p>
<p>Kindred’s flagship Unibet brand is currently live in New Jersey in partnership with Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City, Pennsylvania with Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino, Indiana with Caesars Horseshoe Hammond Casino, Iowa with Harrah’s Casino, Virginia via a direct market access permit, and Arizona, in partnership with the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, Kindred Group teamed with the Swinomish Tribe in a six-year agreement for the launch of the Unibet &amp; Swinomish Sportsbook at Swinomish Casino &amp; Lodge in Anacortes, Washington, pending licensure and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to supporting sport, Unibet partnered with the Northern Ontario Curling Association (NOCA) to become the official sponsor for both the Men’s and Women’s Curling Championship for the entire 2022-2023 season.</p>
<p>Outside of North America, Kindred’s Unibet extended its current soccer commitment in France to include basketball, setting itself a 2023 target of delivering sports kits and equipment to 400 amateur clubs from both sports.</p>
