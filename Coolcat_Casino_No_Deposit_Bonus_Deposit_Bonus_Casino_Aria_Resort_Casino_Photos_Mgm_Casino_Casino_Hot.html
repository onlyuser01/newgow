<p>888 continues to expand its iGaming footprint with quality slot products in the latest tie-up with ReelNRG, including Goddess of Asia, Fortunes of the Jungle, Nefertiti’s Gold.</p>
<p>ReelNRG Becomes 888’s Latest iGaming Supplier</p>
<p>888 Holdings has struck another pivotal partnership with casino development firm ReelNRG which will assist the company in delivering next-generation gaming solutions. 888 Holdings holds several websites operating in the online gambling space, including 888poker, 888casino and 888Sport, and is often known for its proclivity to develop in-house products.</p>
<p>Moving forward, 888casino will offer the full suite of ReelNRG slots, adding classic and fresh releases to the overall selection of products. Commenting on these developments, ReelNRG CEO, Calvin Kent, said he was excited to see 888casino endorse the company’s product with a launch imminent next quarter.</p>
<p>They’re known for their high-quality content and superior player experience, and I strongly believe our growing portfolio of high-quality games will make a fantastic and new addition for their player base.</p>
<p>The company was pleased to have this opportunity and work with 888casino. The companies will first release the refreshed game portfolio in Spain and the United Kingdom, pivoting specific and pre-selected games before introducing the entire portfolio.</p>
<p>Guy Cohen, 888 Holdings SVP B2C, said that ReelNRG would make a perfect fit to the 888’s portfolio. He praised ReelNRG’s features, themes and mechanics and said that the company’s products would make a worthy addition to the 888casino lobby.</p>
<p>888, Cohen said, relied on a wide variety of quality products, something ReelNRG added to beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>More Deals Allow 888 to Develop Its Portfolio</p>
<p>In introducing new content suppliers to its iGaming vertical, 888 has added other worthwhile companies, including Realistic Games earlier this month. In commenting on the partnerships, Robert Lee from Realistic Games said that his company is adding some of the “most successful 3 and 5-reel slot titles, ” including:</p>
<p>Goddess of Asia</p>
<p>Fortunes of the Jungle</p>
<p>Nefertiti’s Gold</p>
<p>Reel Angels</p>
<p>Sensei’s Luck</p>
<p>Cohen spoke on the occasion of that partnership as well, reaffirming 888’s stance to provide the best products to a growing audience. The company also teamed up with Gaming Realms to bring next-gen slingo games to the platform.</p>
<p>As a result, players now can enjoy a number of Slingo gems, including Monopoly Slingo, Slingo X Factor, Slingo Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and others.</p>
<p>888 continues to strengthen its offering, even though the company posted rather dispiriting quarterly results, with pre-tax profit dropping to $45.3 million for the period leading up to December 31. That constituted a 58.3% drop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company used the opportunity to reiterate its commitment to safer gambling and continuous improvement across all verticals.</p>
