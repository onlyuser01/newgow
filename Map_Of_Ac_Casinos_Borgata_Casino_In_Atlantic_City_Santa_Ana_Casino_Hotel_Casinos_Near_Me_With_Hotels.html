<p>The global audio partner of the Premier League and leading sports radio station, talkSPORT, expanded its team of experts by hiring the services of James Kennedy. Last week, he was appointed to the role of head of talkSPORT BET in an effort to boost the reach of the brand and help it reach a new level of growth.</p>
<p>It was back in August last year when details about talkSPORT BET first emerged. Then, the new brand, which is managed by talkSPORT and is a collaboration between the media company and BetVictor, was officially launched. Now, with Kennedy as head of talkSPORT BET, the brand is expected to grow further.</p>
<p>“Delighted to share that I’m starting a new position as Head of talkSPORT BET! Still within the BetVictor world but leading this exciting new brand, partnered with talkSPORT. Absolutely made up, can’t wait for the year ahead,“ James Kennedy, head of talkSPORT BET</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Kennedy shared his excitement in a post via LinkedIn saying that he is delighted to become head of talkSPORT BET. Finally, Kennedy said that he is looking forward to the exciting year ahead.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that Kennedy was selected for that role, given his extensive experience within the entertainment and sports vertical. Before becoming a part of talkSPORT BET, he held the role of head of UK engagement with the leading independent bookmaker and betting innovations leader, BetVictor.</p>
<p>Overall, Kennedy was a part of BetVictor for 2.5 years. During his tenure with the company, he played a strategic role in managing social media and site content. At the same time, he helped BetVictor grow its customer base via innovative and engaging experiences.</p>
<p>Before BetVictor, Kennedy was a part of GAMING1 where he held the role of betting consultant. His professional background includes a product owner for sportsbook and search position with Addison Global Limited, as well as a lengthy tenure with the globally recognized operator William Hill. Kennedy’s tenure with William Hill spanned more than eight years until September 2017. At the time, he held multiple strategic roles such as VIP account manager and international operations manager.</p>
