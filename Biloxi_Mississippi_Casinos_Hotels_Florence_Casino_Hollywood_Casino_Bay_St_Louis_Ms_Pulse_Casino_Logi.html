    <h1>Biloxi Mississippi Casinos Hotels Florence Casino Hollywood Casino Bay St Louis Ms Pulse Casino Logi</h1>

<p>SoftSwiss, a company that focuses on developing software for the iGaming industry, has revealed a new partnership with Spin Samurai, an online gaming operator. Based on this partnership, SoftSwiss will leverage its award-winning Jackpot Aggregator to launch an ambitious new campaign with the operator.</p>
<p>The campaign will have a maximum reward of €100,000 which will be awarded to one lucky player, with overall three prize levels integrated into the promotion. Spin Samurai, which is licensed under a Curacao eGaming license, offers a distinct iGaming theme inspired by Japanese tradition.</p>
<p>Apart from helping the operator establish this new promotion, SoftSwiss will also leverage the Jackpot Aggregator tool to help with jackpot experiences for Spin Samurai players. SoftSwiss makes sure that it provides partner operators with the full range of technical support that ensures that a brand can leverage Jackpot Aggregator to its full benefit.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership, SoftSwiss Head of Jackpot Aggregator Aliaksei Douhin, said: "We are delighted that Spin Samurai has launched their own jackpot campaign with our product. We are glad that every new partner we acquire gets an additional opportunity to develop in new directions."</p>
<p>Douhin confirmed that the company was constantly on the lookout for new collaborations and was seeking to continually improve the offer it extends to partner brands. A spokesperson for Spin Samurai said that the addition of Jackpot Aggregator enables the company to launch "fantastic" promotions and offer players excellent promotional opportunities.</p>
<p>Both SoftSwiss and Spin Samurai are very much confident in their collaboration and future implications for players. SoftSwiss has been a known partner of operators and has been exceptionally good in creating fresh experiences and opportunities for engagement between businesses and potential and existing players.</p>
<p>Recently, SoftSwiss launched a new feature to its iGaming suite and platform called Team Tournaments, another market-defining engagement tool designed to help boost the company’s overall prowess in bringing new players and keeping existing ones entertained.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss has also seen very good results from its Afflika solution, a tracking tool that allows partner businesses to quickly analyze their performances and see where they have shortcomings in engaging potential new players.</p>
