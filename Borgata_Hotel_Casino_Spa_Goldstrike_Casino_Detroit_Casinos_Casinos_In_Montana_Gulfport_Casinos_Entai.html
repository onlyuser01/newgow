<p>Sports wagering group Entain Plc’s Party Poker and Party Casino brands have signed a multi-year deal with the McLaren Racing team.</p>
<p>Entain Plc’s Party Brands Form an Alliance with McLaren</p>
<p>Entain Plc, one of the world’s largest sports betting and entertainment groups, has entered into a multi-year partnership with the McLaren Racing team through its Party brands, PartyCasino and PartyPoker.</p>
<p>The new alliance, built on “a shared track record of delivering entertainment through cutting-edge innovation,” according to a joint statement, would focus on responsibility and safety. Entain and McLaren will promote safe and responsible betting starting with the Monaco Grand Prix onward.</p>
<p>Entain Plc CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen said that the company is proud to partner up with McLaren Racing. The team is known for its thrilling entertainment, cutting-edge technology, and innovation. She said that the team has the same approach of providing an exciting experience to its fans. The team anticipates the opportunity to create content together for PartyCasino and PartyPoker.</p>
<p>Entain would provide betting and gaming fans exclusive content, launching a platform called Access. It will feature McLaren-themed content, “opening the door to the world Formula One” with games on PartyCasino and PartyPokers sites. Access will also include competitions for winning access to McLaren Technology Center and promotions shared by both companies on social media channels.</p>
<p>McLaren Racing CEO, Zak Brown said that fan entertainment is one of the main focuses of the team and sees that Entain also shares the same values, providing safe and responsible exciting content to its clients. He said that the team looks forward to its partnership with Entain from Monaco Grand Prix forward.</p>
<p>The deal further expands the presence of the FTSE100-listed gambling group into the sporting world. It confirms the relationship with professional clubs, while Entain’s “Pitching In” initiative, run in collaboration with the Trident Leagues, would continue to support grassroots teams.</p>
<p>Entain Published Its Q12021 Trading Report</p>
<p>In April, Entain has published its Q1 trading update, which records a 13% decrease in net revenues due to restricted retail units. The group continues to focus on its digital presence and its online gambling, recording “21 quarters of double-digit growth in a row” and a period of NGR increase of +33%.</p>
<p>In Q12021, the company also successfully acquired Bet.pt in Portugal and Enlabs AB, which are part of Entain’s strategy for growth and expansion on regulated markets. The company also plans to increase its market share in the US with BetMGM.</p>
<p>Entain would most likely acquire a three-year license, strengthening its presence in Nevada as the NGC will gather and decide on the matter on Wednesday, May 20. If the state’s gaming regulators grand the license, Entain will further strengthen its positions in the US.</p>
