<p>Expanding on a previous partnership signed back in October, 2019 to allow the support of TRON e-wallets, Samsung will now offer TRON Dapps in its dedicated Galaxy Store.</p>
<p>Samsung and Tron have expanded on a previous partnership singed last year and focusing on allowing Tron wallets on the South Korean tech giant‚Äôs Galaxy Store. As per the latest tie-up, however, Tron can now introduce Dapps to the Galaxy Store, and potentially pave the way for gambling solutions later on.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Store started accepting Dapps on Monday, April 27, and various on-chain games will be allowed first. There has been no mention of iGaming solutions, but competitors such as Google Play and Apple Store have strict policies for any gambling products.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest developments, Justin Sun, Tron founder, argued that the partnership would allow both companies to develop their ecosystems by bringing their products closer together.</p>
<p>Take a break for a little bit of Sunday reading. ‚òïÔ∏è üì∞ üöÄ https://t.co/4pBwhJlhBR #TRON #TRX ‚Äî TRON Foundation (@Tronfoundation) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>This Is the Beginning of a New Era for Tron, Sun Says</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sun spoke with Forbes crypto and blockchain contributor Darryn Pollock about Tron‚Äôs closer ties with Samsung. Here is what he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the beginning of a new era. Just imagine: after Samsung and all the phone manufacturers begin to integrate blockchain technology infrastructures, applications that may include blockchain or cryptocurrencies will pop up everywhere.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dating back to October, 2019, this partnership has been long in the making. Samsung released a software development kit (SDK) allowing users access to the Tron blockchain from the company‚Äôs devices.</p>
<p>Sun called the latest development an ‚Äúamazing opportunity,‚Äù excited that Tron would be able to reach new audiences via Samsung‚Äôs network. Samsung is also a leading manufacturer or smartphones and tablets, outpacing its main competitor Apple, with nearly 100 million units more shipped in 2019. However, Apple has caught up.</p>
<p>Allowing crypto gambling products could be a leap, however, as Sun‚Äôs project bore recent criticism and prompted a barrage of social media attacks. Specifically, Sun is reportedly trying to place favorable validators in Steem‚Äôs proof-of-stake system, CoinTelegraph reported.</p>
