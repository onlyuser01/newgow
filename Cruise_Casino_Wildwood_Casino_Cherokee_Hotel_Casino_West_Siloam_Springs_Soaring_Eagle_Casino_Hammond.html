    <h1>Cruise Casino Wildwood Casino Cherokee Hotel Casino West Siloam Springs Soaring Eagle Casino Hammond</h1>

<p>Hello, I come to you to complain that this casino is a scam and fraud. I recently registered and made a deposit in the currency that I use ARS. At the moment I am in Argentina and it is the currency that I use for my daily life that I am aware of and which I must use since it is the only one that I handle. I deposited at this casino and have withdrawn. On the third time I deposit and withdraw my money does not arrive. It should be noted that I have played in a normal way and deposited in a normal way, I have played and in my game history there is no inconsistency in use, there are no closed bets so as not to lose, on the contrary, there are bets in which I lose and win in a normal way . Then when I decided to withdraw, they suspended my account, put me under investigation and asked me for an explanation of why I use that currency. Obviously, I reply that because I live in Argentina it is the currency that I handle and use daily and it is the one that I must deposit. There's no way I can deposit an INDIAN RUPIA if I don't know about that currency and I don't even have it in my hand. After a week of investigation, they suspend my account, alleging that they are not a financial institution to make currency exchanges, that I have committed fraud and that for that reason they will confiscate the funds. MY MONEY DEPOSITED ENTIRELY FROM ME, AND NOT FROM ANY PROMOTIONAL BONUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I leave the catch</p>
<p>In addition to this, I want to clarify that I deposit in ARS, therefore they must send me by ARS and it is up to them to send N another currency as long as it has the appropriate conversion. FOR NO REASON HAVE I ASKED TO SEND MONEY IN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE ONE I DEPOSITED. So it is not a fraud that they say that I make currency exchanges according to their email.</p>
<p>THIS CASINO IS A SCAM</p>
