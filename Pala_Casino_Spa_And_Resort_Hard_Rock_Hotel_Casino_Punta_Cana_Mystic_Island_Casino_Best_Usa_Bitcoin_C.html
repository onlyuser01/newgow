<p>Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox Tells Analysts Macau Wynn Palace Needs Additional 1,300 Hotel Rooms to Accomodate Gambler Demand</p>

<p>The Wynn Palace is sending would-be guests away because of insufficient hotel rooms especially after selling out on busy weekends in Macau. Given the high-occupancy resort casino model, the lack of inventory to fill that high demand could mean money is left on the tables, so to speak.</p>

<p>The Wynn Palace currently has 1,706 rooms. Some 1,300 additional rooms are planned once two adjacent expansions are complete.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Wynn Resorts Ltd. CEO Matthew Maddox told analysts during a conference call “On the weekends, we’re turning away [Palace] customers that we do not want to be turning away. And we know that they will spend more time and more money with us if they’re staying with us.”</p>
<p>Casino hotels typically run [at] 95 percent occupancies, since empty rooms don’t place bets,” Reneta McCarthy, senior lecturer at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration, told Casino.org.</p>
<p>“If a hotel is running an annual occupancy of 70 percent or 80 percent, that means that they are sold out several nights a week and will be turning people away,” she added.</p>
<p>Wynn Palace opened about three years ago as the company’s second Macau property. It is time for expanded space, company officials said.</p>
<p>“I think you can see from some of our competitors that have just ramped up their new, quite nice hotel product, what that has done to their bottom line,” Maddox added.</p>
<p>What’s to Come for Wynn Palace</p>
<p>Starting in 2021, the company is likely to begin construction of a glass addition called the Crystal Pavilion, and add a 650-room tower. It will cost $2 billion and is scheduled to open in 2024.</p>
<p>A second phase of building will lead to the property getting another 650 rooms. It will also be in a tower.</p>
<p>The planned expansions will not include any new gambling space. But the company will construct areas for a theater, art museum and restaurant — an apparent lure for mass market tourists as opposed to VIP gamblers.</p>
<p>“We think that the Crystal Pavilion project will be attractive to a much broader audience,” Maddox said. “We think that we’ll get significant incremental visitation from the core mass [players] with the [Crystal Pavilion] project.</p>
<p>“Macau is… really [a] core mass market-driven market right now,” he explained. “We’re continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market.”</p>
<p>Lack of Rooms Ongoing Issue</p>
<p>Reneta McCarthy confirmed that many hotels “frequently” do not have enough rooms.</p>
<p>In this situation, she advises hotels to use “proper revenue management … [and] … setting their rates high enough … that they are getting the most money they can for the rooms they are selling.”</p>
<p>There are some short-terms solutions, too. For hotels, generally, they should “close out … low rates and only sell rooms at … [their] highest rates,” McCarthy said. For the long-term, hotels with insufficient rooms should add and expand, she noted.</p>
<p>When it comes to VIP gamblers, “They are the people who will lose the most money — which means you are likely to comp their room because you know how much you will theoretically make from them based on their historical play,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Q2 Revenue</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Ltd. (NASDAQ: WYNN) reported its second-quarter earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) came in at 88 cents a share, missing analysts’ estimate of $1.26. But turnover at the company’s Macau properties edged higher.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in Macau, considered the company’s most important market, fell 2.6 percent to $343 million, below the estimate of $355 million.</p>
<p>But revenue at its properties there increased. Casino revenues from Wynn Palace were $528.5 million for the second quarter of 2019, a 0.7 percent increase over $525.0 million for the second quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Operating revenues from Wynn Macau were $546.5 million for the second quarter of 2019. That is a 0.6 percent increase over $543.3 million for the second quarter of 2018.</p>
