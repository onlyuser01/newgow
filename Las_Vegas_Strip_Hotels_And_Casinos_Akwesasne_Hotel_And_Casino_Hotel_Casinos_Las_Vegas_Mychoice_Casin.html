<p>The latest slot arrival to Relax Gaming’s portfolio, which aggregates games from iGaming’s leading developers, is a great opportunity to grab your pickaxe and strike gold. With a multiplier of 50,000x, the Mega Mine: Nudging Ways slot is an experience built to reward gamers.</p>
<p>Mega Mine: Nudging Ways Gameplay and Mechanics</p>
<p>The game provides players with the opportunity to explore brand-new game features as presented by Relax, including the Nudging Mystery Stacks feature that will take you closer to the action and introduce you to the mustachioed miner who is fervently looking to add to his riches.</p>
<p>The Mystery Stacks feature has a shot at surfacing at every reel to boost your overall winning potential in what is a 5×4-layout game with 32,768 ways to win. Mega Mine includes wild symbols and scatter symbols, as well as many colorful jewels that will add to the game’s immersive experience but also make for beautiful paying symbols.</p>
<p>Players stand to benefit from free spins through the scatter symbols. For two scatters you will get six free spins and each scatter extra means one more free spin to enjoy. There is a Mega Free Spins bonus round where the Nudging Mystery Stacks have a boosted chance of dropping.</p>
<p>Innovating the iGaming Experience Is Relax Gaming’s Formula</p>
<p>If you wish to boost your winning potential but not wait around, you can use the buy feature rounds where you will find the Mega Free Spins option that you can buy into. Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon has commended the release of the latest title, arguing that Relax has always been looking to introduce new mechanics and iGaming formulas to the industry.</p>
<p>“With this production, the key is giving players more ways to win and opportunities to achieve impressive wins in order to add both excitement and potential. In every slot we release, we continue to drive the differentiation in our games that is such a strong part of our ethos.” Relax Gaming CPO Simon Hammon</p>
<p>Hammon is confident that the game will start on a strong foothold with gamers and will gradually continue to scale up its momentum. Relax Gaming has been able to lead the way in delivering outstanding products that fit industry needs and has won numerous distinctions by the likes of EGR and CasinoBeats. Relax recently expanded in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands as part of its growing portfolio reach.</p>
