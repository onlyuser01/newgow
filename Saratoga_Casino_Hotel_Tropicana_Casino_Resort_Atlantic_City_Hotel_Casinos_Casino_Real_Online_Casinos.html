<p>Pragmaticplay has been offering games with a future bonus for some time.</p>
<p>That means, for example, that you pay 20% more for every spin and you have better chances of a future.</p>
<p>I especially noticed it with the game Hand of Midas. When you activate the future game you pay 25 cents instead of 20 cents. (example)</p>
<p>Now additional scatters come into play.</p>
<p>From this point on you have to watch the game.</p>
<p>Let's assume there is a scatter on each of the first 2 reels and you still have 3 reels free - now you can see a hand on reel 3 just below your playing field - reel 4 is on - again no scatter and if the spin is over is-suddenly the scatter below the reel 3 has disappeared and another sign is there.</p>
<p>So a fake scatter. How high are the chances that the additionally used scatter will remain on the reel if they suddenly disappear - zero.</p>
<p>I also did a test once -without the additional function 100 spins-achieved 3 free spins and won more outside of the free spins than with the additional bonus. I got free spins twice and because there are more scatter in the game, there are more interruption lines in the game. Because besides giving you free spins, they do you more harm than good. It doesn't make much sense to have 2scatters that take away my profit lines.</p>
<p>So stay away from these so-called future at hands of midas</p>
