<p>The leading casino games developer, ELA Games, confirmed it secured a new license, allowing it to expand its presence in Europe. The company has announced it secured a business-to-business (B2B) license for the regulated gambling market in Sweden. The announcement from ELA Games comes after the developer was awarded a license from the gambling regulator in the country, the Swedish Gambling Authority (Spelinspektionen).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the license enables the company to grow its presence in the country. As a result, ELA Games will be able to join forces with licensed operators in Sweden, delivering its thrilling portfolio of games to new audiences.</p>
<p>Currently, the games provided by the company stand out with their high quality, engaging features, as well as unique designs. Thanks to the new license from Spelinspektionen, online customers in the country will be able to access hit titles from ELA Games such as Cash of Gods and Vikings Wild Cash, among other thrilling and engaging games. The company's games were already recognized by Swedish stakeholders for their quality and ELA Games anticipates they will be well-received in the strategic European market.</p>
<p>‍Michael Cini, ELA Games' Business Owner, commented on the topic in a statement. He explained: "Being licensed in Sweden is a tremendous opportunity to continue our expansion across Europe’s regulated markets." Finally, Cini pointed out: "We look forward to providing our games to Swedish players and working in close cooperation with the SGA and the many top level operators as we position ourselves as a key content provider in the market."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spelinspektionen granted license to another leading provider of quality games for the online gambling sector. Back in July, the gambling regulator granted a license to Lady Luck Games, a fast-growing developer of games for the online gambling industry. This milestone achievement enabled the company to continue expanding its presence on the Old Continent, allowing it to deliver its games to new audiences.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Spelinspektionen awarded a SEK9m ($810,000) penalty to Video Slots LTD. At the time of the announcement, the gambling regulator claimed it uncovered breaches of the brand related to money laundering regulations.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the B2B license secured by ELA Games would help the company grow further. In fact, it represents an important part of its expansion plan on the Old Continent, allowing it to propel the reach of its unique portfolio.</p>
