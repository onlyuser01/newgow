<p>Penn National Gaming has become a part of the American Gaming Association’s “Have A Game Plan” initiative that is designed to tackle problem gambling in the context of the quickly growing iGaming and sports betting markets in the United States.</p>
<p>The campaign, which saw a number of sports bodies and teams join, is now expanding to include various gambling operators who remain committed to protecting their customers. Penn National makes a strong pick for the program as it currently operates in 13 states as a licensed entity, the press release details.</p>
<p>AGA Reinforces Responsible Gambling Message with Penn National</p>
<p>This puts it in a unique position to drive home the campaign’s message. Penn National offers both online sports betting and retail wagering through its Barstool Sportsbook, and it further has a plethora of iGaming products and offerings.</p>
<p>The “Have A Game Plan” will be available on all of the company’s channels and gaming media. Commenting on this partnership, Penn National head of interactive Jon Kaplowitz called it a success and one of the main goals of the company:</p>
<p>“Responsible gaming is core to our sports betting operations, and we’re thrilled to extend these efforts through our partnership with the AGA’s ‘Have A Game Plan’ initiative.” Penn National head of interactive Jon Kaplowitz</p>
<p>Kaplowitz is confident that the campaign will allow the company to educate sports fans as to what the dangers of excessive gambling are and how to stay safe while betting in a response in a “fan-friendly way.”</p>
<p>AGA has been at the forefront of responsible gambling, launching a number of similar campaigns that are designed to help consumers stay protected in the quickly developing gambling market. The campaign is seeking to establish the core principles of responsible gambling such as existing in more mature markets.</p>
<p>Addressing Fears about Gambling Expansion</p>
<p>Fears that responsible gambling is neglected have been heard from addiction specialists. The recent launch of the online New York sports betting market came with similar concerns. AGA’s campaign, though is looking to help consumers educate themselves.</p>
<p>This includes reading better into the odds, choosing trusted operators, and sticking to a budget to avoid any significant losses. AGA SVP Casey Clark commented on the partnership and praised Penn National for both its online and retail footprint:</p>
<p>“We are appreciative of Penn National’s significant commitment to the campaign, as we collectively work to ensure every sports bettor is equipped with the knowledge to wager responsibly.” AGA SVP Casey Clark</p>
<p>So far, AGA has been able to sign over 20 partners to its program, making it one of the most successful such campaigns in the developing gambling market in the United States. The latest entities to join the campaign include the</p>
<p>Madison Square Garden Sports Corp and Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. and Rush Street Interactive, as well as MGM Resorts and BetMGM.</p>
