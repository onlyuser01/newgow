<p>Alvin Chau Trial Wraps, Verdict Expected January 18</p>

<p>Closing arguments in the trial of Alvin Chau and 20 others linked to now-defunct junket operator Suncity concluded Thursday. A three-judge panel will deliver a verdict in the two-month long case January 18.</p>

<p>As chairman and CEO of Suncity, Chau was one of the most powerful and wealthiest people in Macau. Suncity was the enclave’s biggest junket operator, responsible for an estimated 25% of VIP market revenue in the world’s biggest gambling hub. In 2014, Macau’s best year, that would have equated to US$11 billion.</p>
<p>But his activities irritated the politburo in Beijing, which has been waging a war against cross-border gambling. It blamed Suncity for money laundering and capital flight. Sensationally, prosecutors in Wenzhou, eastern China, issued a warrant for Chau’s arrest in November 2021.</p>
<p>He was detained by Macau authorities days later, and charged by the special administrative region’s own independent judiciary with running a criminal syndicate, illicit gambling activities, fraud, and money laundering.</p>
<p>‘No Incentive’ for Side-Betting</p>
<p>Central to the trial is the allegation that Chau and his company profited from an illegal side-betting operation. The claim is it cheated the Macau government out of more than US$1 billion in gaming taxes.</p>
<p>This allegedly involved the junket group privately offering to multiply stakes on official bets placed by VIP clients at Macau casinos. The bets would be settled later, tax-free, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>In final arguments, Chau’s lawyer Leong Hon Man argued his client had “no incentive” to risk everything by offering illegal betting.</p>
<p>With the scale Suncity had achieved and the social status Chau enjoyed, “would he really have risked – with the thousands of workers he employed – committing these illegal activities?” Leong asked, as translated by Macau Business.</p>
<p>“Suncity Group’s revenue even exceeded that of Las Vegas, [which made it] the world’s largest junket company, and every meeting was recorded. But even the witness of the [Macau Judiciary Police] testified that no illegal activities were found in the Suncity VIP rooms,” Leong added.</p>
<p>Chau’s Final Plea</p>
<p>Chau himself took the stand to make a final plea, emphasizing that “Suncity has never been a criminal syndicate, nor a triad, as alleged.”</p>
<p>Suncity had actually helped improve the operational model of junket operators in Macau… which had become more ‘corporation-like’ and standardized,” he claimed.</p>
<p>Chau also pleaded for leniency for his codefendants.</p>
<p>“All my colleagues have good educational backgrounds,” he said. “They have no motives for committing the crimes. I want to apologize to them and their families for putting them in misery.”</p>
