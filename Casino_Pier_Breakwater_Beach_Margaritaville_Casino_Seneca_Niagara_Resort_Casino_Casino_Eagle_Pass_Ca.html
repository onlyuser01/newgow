<p>Thanks for the answer, Radka! :)</p>
<p>Indeed, "no deposit" sounds cool, but when I read the conditions for wagering I get scared)))) Also, for the sake of testing, I decided to try 2 no deposit bonuses in different casinos and I managed to win quite a lot of money. When I looked at the conditions to win them back, they seemed to me cosmic. But I have a suspicion that this "luck" was just to grab me. Once I start wagering, that kind of luck won't be there anymore. But having already spent some of the money I won't have much choice. That is, it looks like nothing more than a trap to me. Am I wrong? :) So, it seems to me that just playing with your money would make more sense (unless you have a fat wallet). Or at least use the deposit bonus :)</p>
<p>Can I make an assumption that other players are just chasing free "cheese", not paying attention to the conditions, and how to get it? Is that the only reason why the no deposit bonus is so popular? Or I don't understand something and there are other reasons?</p>
<p>I also thought that players take it to try this or that casino. But there are free game options.</p>
<p>In any case, you made some clarity on this for me :) Thanks! :) I would like to players to tell their opinion, but they somehow are not very active here))) Just shouting "give me a bonus"))).</p>
<p>What about the casino? I know we have a few "officials" in Ukraine. And if I see another casino that I like? Again, how does a player know it's safe? I know that there are licenses, but they do not tell me anything, unfortunately. There are standard parameters that all have (payment methods, payout time, customer support, and others), but from my observations, they are quite similar from casino to casino. What other parameters can be used to determine that the casino is good?</p>
<p>Thank you! :)</p>
