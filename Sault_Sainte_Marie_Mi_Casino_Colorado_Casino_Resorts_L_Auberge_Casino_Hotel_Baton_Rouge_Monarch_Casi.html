    <h1>Sault Sainte Marie Mi Casino Colorado Casino Resorts L Auberge Casino Hotel Baton Rouge Monarch Casi</h1>

<p>Both individuals boast impressive track records and will be instrumental in the company’s growth.</p>
<p>B90 Holdings has enhanced its leadership team with a new appointment and a promotion. As announced by the company, it has promoted its recently-appointed consultant Farzad Peyman as the company’s new chief financial and M&amp;A development officer. At the same time, B90 Holdings has welcomed Andrew McIver as a non-executive director.</p>
<p>The online betting &amp; marketing company described both appointees as experienced individuals who will leverage their experience to help the company expand its business and realize its strategy.</p>
<p>Peyman is an accomplished senior executive with broad experience across sectors such as iGaming, software and technology. Before he joined B90 Holdings, Peyman served as a strategic advisor at betPawa. His prior experiences include stints with Titan Corp and Betopia.</p>
<p>Peyman served Matchbook Betting Exchange in a variety of capacities for over 9 years. He is also the founder of Virya Solutions, a consultancy that offers advice to gambling, iGaming, esports, Web3, Metaverse and Blockchain businesses.</p>
<p>McIver, on the other hand, is an experienced gaming industry heavyweight who has previously served as the non-executive chairman of SKS365. In addition to that, he had a two-year tenure as group chief executive officer of Jackpotjoy Group. His earlier experiences include a stint as a NED at Daniel Stewart &amp; Company and more than 11 years with Sportingbet.</p>
<p>Breivik Welcomed the New Hires on Board</p>
<p>Both new appointees boast an impressive track record and will be instrumental in scaling B90 Holdings. They were welcomed to the B90 family by Ronny Breivik, the company’s executive chairman. Breivik said that he is glad to have the two of them on board, noting that their appointment follows the appointment of Mark Blandford as strategic adviser.</p>
<p>For reference, Blandford is the founder of Sportingbet – the business McIver worked with for over a decade.</p>
<p>Our team looks forward to pooling our vast insight, knowledge, strategic experience and networks to capitalize on opportunities, which we have in our sight, with a clear and open runway for growth. Ronny Breivik, executive chairman, B90 Holdings</p>
<p>In the meantime, B90 Holdings recently unveiled its plans for the acquisition of Emwys, a Swedish-based marketing company in the online gambling sector in a $4 million deal. The former party hopes that the M&amp;A agreement will bring important pay-per-click expertise to its business.</p>
