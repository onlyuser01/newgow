<p>The Casino Committee of Thailand led a survey on how people would feel if casinos open in the country. Apparently, four in five people support the idea.</p>
<p>Many Support Opening Casinos</p>
<p>The survey questioned a total of 3,296 Thai citizens. It turns out 81% of them would like to see casinos launch in the country.</p>
<p>The Casino Committee also inquired about what type of casinos the Thai would like to see. When asked about their preferred facilities, 64% said that they would like casinos with a department store. Another 40% agree that it would be best if casinos have an adjacent spa facility. About 39% of the respondents said that it is necessary to have banks. Lastly, 37% were okay with a standalone casino with no annex facilities.</p>
<p>More than half of the respondents (57%) agree that Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, is the best location to open a gambling venue.</p>
<p>Some Remain Skeptical</p>
<p>Although people agree that a casino would benefit the local economy and encourage tourism, many are cautious of the dangers of casino crime. Around 55% are concerned about crime.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the majority believes the positives outweigh the negatives. Notably, people hope that a legal gambling alternative will help to curb illegal gambling. In addition, people hope that a casino would revitalize the Thai economy and help it compete with nearby Macau.</p>
<p>Sadly, the findings of the Committee’s survey may not represent how the overall population of Thailand has been feeling about casinos. Many people still remain skeptical of the idea. Some oppose legalizing gambling, while others simply doubt that casinos are the panacea the government is looking for.</p>
<p>The Efforts to Legalize Gambling Continue</p>
<p>The casino proposition came last month when the Casino Committee put forward the idea of allowing five casinos to open in Thailand. The plan is to have one casino in Thailand’s five busiest areas – one in Bangkok and its vicinity, another one in Chiang Rai or Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand, a third in Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchathani or Udon Thani in Northeastern Thailand, a fourth one in Krabi, Phuket or Phang-nga in Southern Thailand and a final one in Pattaya City in Eastern Thailand.</p>
<p>As per the Committee’s proposal, only people who are 20 years old or older will be allowed to bet. In addition, it plans to tax casinos 30% of their revenues, hoping that this will nurture the Thai economy. However, it remains to be seen whether these plans will come to fruition. Luckily, the country’s current king is not as opposed to gambling as his predecessor.</p>
