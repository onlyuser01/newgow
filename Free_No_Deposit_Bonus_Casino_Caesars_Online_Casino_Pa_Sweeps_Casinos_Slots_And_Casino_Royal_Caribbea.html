<p>Totem Towers review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around Polynesian art and culture.</p>
<p>Players will wander through a steamy jungle and find carved mystical totems. With colourful and fierce expressions, the totems will come to life and decide the player’s fate.</p>
<p>The mood of this game is an exotic holiday turned fantasy adventure. The tropical setting is immersive, and players will have fun bringing these totems to life.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack adds an epic tone with bold string notes combined with gentle crickets. This creates the feeling that players have entered a spirit-filled jungle.</p>
<p>The totems portray wildcats, frogs, snakes, and alluring jungle plants. Carved in bright hues, the totem’s faces range from adorable to intimidating. Upon wins, the symbols shimmer with golden sparkles, furthering the magical theme.</p>
<p>The art style is whimsical and brings to mind a psychedelic trip. Players may feel like they’ve had some shamanic tea or fallen under the spell of old spirits.</p>
<p>The setting seems to be an ancient stone wall overgrown with lush foliage. It feels like a place players have stumbled upon and now must unlock its secrets.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Totem Towers is a six reel, three row slot with 25 winlines in the standard game.</p>
<p>Players can unlock up to 101 winlines, gaining increasing numbers of winlines as they land wins.</p>
<p>The gameplay has a fast pace, and players will find it easy to get into the rhythm.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. The Wild symbol appears only on reels 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<p>Scatter symbols may contribute to wins that add to the player's winline total. Scatter wins are also multiplied by the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>The Totem Tower feature is triggered when symbols of the same colour fill a reel (this excludes the Wild symbol). The full reel of symbols then turns to Wilds.</p>
<p>Players are awarded 10 free spins when 3 Scatter symbols land on the reels. The player receives 15 for 4 Scatter symbols, 25 for 5 Scatter symbols, and 100 for 6 Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.63%, well above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€500 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility Polynesian-themed slot.</p>
<p>The trippy art style is captivating, and the high RTP keeps it a reasonable choice for players who care about math and house edge. Players looking to maximize their chances to hit big wins may be interested in moving on to a game with higher volatility.</p>
<p>The unique increasing line boosts are an interesting variation to try, and the bonus options will be a familiar attraction for many players.</p>
