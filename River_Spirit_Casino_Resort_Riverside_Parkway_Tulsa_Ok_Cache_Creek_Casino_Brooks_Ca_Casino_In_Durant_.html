    <h1>River Spirit Casino Resort Riverside Parkway Tulsa Ok Cache Creek Casino Brooks Ca Casino In Durant</h1>

<p>Last weekend was strange in the NFL, to put it mildly. The Green Bay Packers lost to the New York Giants 27-22 in the London Game, despite coming to the UK as nine-point favorites. Meanwhile, the New York Jets obliterated the favored Miami Dolphins 40-17.</p>
<p>Are we going to see more upsets in Week 6? We might, but not in the Jets vs Packers game. In this game, we think Matt LaFleur’s men will triumph, the only question is whether they can cover the spread.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, the spread is set to 9.5 points at most online betting sites. If this seems too much, you better read our Jets vs Packers Week 6 preview to learn why (or why not) should you back Aaron Rodgers &amp; Co. to cover it.</p>

<p>NY Jets Coming Off a Huge Win (But There’s a Caveat!)</p>
<p>Last Sunday, the New York Jets got to a 3-2 record by defeating the Miami Dolphins at home. They entered the game as four-point underdogs, but went on to win the game 40-17, which is their biggest win since November 2019 (when they beat the Las Vegas Raiders 34-3).</p>
<p>Blowing out the Dolphins sure is a great achievement, but the scoresheet doesn’t tell the whole story. First of all, the Jets had a tiny 19-17 lead heading into the final quarter, where everything fell apart for Miami.</p>
<p>An even more important fact is that the Dolphins were without their starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, as well as his replacement, Teddy Bridgewater. Instead, their third-string QB Skylar Thompson was in charge of calling the signals.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers Always Do Great at Lambeau Field</p>
<p>The Packers lost a game in Week 5, but that didn’t come as too much of a shock. First of all, they’re not playing great offensively this season; secondly; the game was played in London. In Week 6, they’re playing at Lambeau Field, where they’ve lost just one game since January 2021.</p>
<p>Further, they’re taking on a team that’s not too great in the defense. Despite being able to hold the Dolphins to just 17 points last weekend, the Jets are conceding 23.6 points per game on average in 2022.</p>
<p>What this means is that the Packers offense might do better than in previous games. Their scoring average this season is just 19.4, with 27 points being the most they’ve scored in a game in the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>Still, knowing that their offense is lead by Aaron Rodgers, who’s one of the best quarterbacks on the planet, we do expect them to do better.</p>
<p>Jets vs Packers Prediction</p>
<p>The Packers are going to win this, we have no doubt about it. The big question is whether they can cover the 9.5-point spread? It all depends on how well Rodgers and his wide receivers perform. Knowing that they usually do perform well at Lambeau, our pick is Green Bay (-9.5).</p>
<p>Picks: Green Bay Packers to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
