Its name is Evolution Gaming, and it supplies the industry only with live casino solutions such as roulette, blackjack, and other table &amp; card games that require a human dealer to run a session.</p>
<p>People love deeper immersion into the casino atmosphere, which the live table games can provide. Top online casino websites quickly grasped that and included live casino games in their list of offerings, making good use of Evolution Gaming software. Now, there are hundreds of Evolution Gaming live casinos available to you as a customer. From Bitcoin users to high rollers, everybody will find the right option in the Casino Guru list of best casinos for 2024.</p>
<p>Right before plunging into the world of Evolution Gaming, you may want to know a little bit of information about this brand, its games, and its reputation. Here we go, starting from the Evolution Gaming history.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming — a pioneer in the live casino industry</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming was founded in 2006, back when live casino games were in a fairly poor state. The name of the brand worked out immediately. In the same year, Evolution Gaming launched its roulette, baccarat, and blackjack live software and signed with the leaders of the gambling industry. The favorite games of millions of players came to life in Evolution Gaming online casinos, run by professional dealers, and streamed from real brick-and-mortar venues.</p>
<p>Since the very start, Evolution Gaming has been primarily focused on the European market. Their first and largest studio of 2,000+ square meters is located in Riga, Latvia. There you’ll find more than 100 tables, which makes it the largest studio of this type operating in Europe.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming also uses some other studios. They include venues in Malta and Aalst (Belgium), while other tables are located in brick-and-mortar casinos such as the Casino de Spa in Belgium and the Dragonara Casino in Malta. There are also dedicated VIP studios with different decors, designed to appeal to high rollers who want a more exclusive experience.</p>
<p>Note: In total, the company owns ten live gaming studios worldwide with more than 2,000 employees running Evolution Gaming live casinos for players like you. 200+ gaming tables are operating daily as of 2019. The 10th studio was opened in the USA, specifically Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2012, Evolution Gaming started producing mobile casino software and introduced Live Casino Hold’em. In 2014-2015, Live Three Card Poker, Caribbean Stud Poker, Dual Play Roulette, and Baccarat Squeeze arrived.</p>
<p>2017 and 2018 were the years of pure innovation, with super-sized lucky wheel Dream Catcher included in the collection of Evolution gaming games and Progressive Jackpot feature added into the Caribbean Stud Poker. What’s more, the brand unveiled the Lightning Roulette game and Infinite Blackjack with unlimited seats for the players.</p>
<p>In 2019, Evolution Gaming stepped beyond the live casino games, bringing Monopoly into the house along with launching the world’s first 24/7 game show called "Deal or No Deal". That’s not to say about new gambling offerings like Free Bet Blackjack and Super Sic Bo.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming has received several certifications from well-respected gambling institutions, including eCOGRA and the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC). All of their technologies are tested and certified by Technical Systems Testing (TST). These prove that casinos with Evolution Gaming software are generally trustworthy and reliable.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the brand won multiple prestigious awards. Few to name are 10-years-in-row EGR B2B Live Casino Supplier of the Year award, Online Casino Supplier of the Year at the Global Gaming Awards London in 2019, and EGR Game of the Year in 2014 for its Immersive Roulette game.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming software and games</p>
<p>The company designed around 30 different experiences for gamblers worldwide, from classic Evolution Gaming live roulette that suits any online casino to relatively exotic Dragon Tiger and Dream Catcher. To learn more about their games, visit livedealers.com, where you can find reviews of most of the provider's games.</p>
<p>Note: Blackjack is the most popular card game found on the Evolution Gaming live casino platform, and the one present in lots of variations. In most live dealer lobbies, you can find several blackjack tables, with a wide choice of stakes. These all seat seven players with stakes ranging from $5 up to $5,000. However, Evolution Gaming Infinite Blackjack accepts thousands of players in a single session.</p>
<p>Another reason almost every live casino uses Evolution Gaming is the fact that it works nicely with other software solutions. Many casinos with Evolution Gaming games onboard may also utilize casino games and software powered by another provider. The company also lists dedicated tables and environments for its business partners, so the online casino can deliver branded experience to their clients using Evolution Gaming software.</p>
<p>Note: Evolution Gaming has also developed the industry's first live slot called Mermaid's Fortune, where a "real" mermaid greets players throughout their game.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming casinos use an instant-play format for their games. This gives players maximum accessibility to any of their live games. The only thing required is to install the latest Adobe Flash player.</p>
<p>How to choose the best casino with Evolution Gaming live software</p>
<p>The choice of Evolution Gaming online casinos can be overwhelming at the first sight. You may even think that it’s impossible to pick just one. However, it may only seem that you need to arduously study terms &amp; conditions and read long reviews of each Evolution Gaming live casino that you encounter.</p>
<p>That’s no longer the case when you have the list of the best Evolution Gaming casinos at hand, compiled and revised by Casino Guru. Every online casino site on our website has its "record card", where you see all essential details about that particular website — pros, cons, payment methods, welcome bonuses, and more. This should be enough for you to make up your mind and take several Evolution Gaming live roulette casinos into consideration.</p>
<p>The best options are already handpicked for you in the "Recommended" tab. Yet, you can narrow down the choice by clicking through other tabs or applying filters. The "Newly Opened" tab shows the most recently launched sites with Evolution Gaming software, while the "All" tab contains all sites in our database.</p>
<p>You can also customize your search with filters like available casino games, payment methods, or licensing authority. The case that you don’t know what to look for in the Evolution Gaming casino site can’t be ruled out as well, so we suggest you take a look at the how to choose a casino article first.</p>
