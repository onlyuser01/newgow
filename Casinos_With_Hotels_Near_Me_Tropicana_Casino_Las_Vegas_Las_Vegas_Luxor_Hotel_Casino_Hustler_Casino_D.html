<p>It‚Äôs Super Bowl time! Philadelphia Eagles vs Kansas City Chiefs is the championship game and we‚Äôre going to preview it in detail now</p>
<p>The time has come for the most important game of the 2022-23 NFL season. Super Bowl LVII is on the program on Sunday, February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will battle for the Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs going to be a fierce battle when two of the NFL‚Äôs most explosive offences clash. Each team has a quarterback who‚Äôs made it to the final shortlist for the MVP award. The Chiefs‚Äô QB Patrick Mahomes is famous for his throws (No. 1 in passing yards and touchdowns), while the Eagles‚Äô signal-thrower Jalen Hurts is famously good on the ground (he‚Äôs the QB with the most rushing TDs).</p>
<p>The finalists are in ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Who's your MVP this season? üèÜ pic.twitter.com/QWjJd4q0Ov ‚Äî NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) January 25, 2023</p>
<p>Neither of them would‚Äôve done so great if it weren‚Äôt for their teammates who‚Äôve been brilliant in 2022-23. Take the Kelce brothers for example. Travis ‚Äì Kansas City‚Äôs tight end ‚Äì has caught 12 TD passes this season. His bro Jason, who plays center for Philadelphia, has been brilliant in keeping his QB safe throughout the season.</p>
<p>The 2023 Super Bowl will also see Kansas City coach Andy Reid take on the franchise he was a part of a decade ago. His Philadelphia story ended without too many major successes, but his KC tale has been a very successful one. On February 12, Reid will get a chance to win his second Lombardi with the Chiefs.</p>

<p>All Eyes on Patrick Mahomes (And His Ankle)</p>
<p>Patrick Mahomes is arguably the best quarterback in 2023. He lead the NFL this season with a career-high 5,250 passing yards, throwing for a total of 41 touchdowns. Knowing this, it‚Äôs crystal clear that he‚Äôs Kansas City‚Äôs crucial player.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Mahomes might be struggling with an ankle injury he suffered in the Divisional Round game with the Jacksonville Jaguars, in which he went 22/30 for 195 yards and two touchdowns. The pain in his leg did not stop him from taking a part in the AFC Championship Game, in which he did even better ‚Äì 29/43 for 326 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>PATRICK MAHOMES SCRAMBLES ON AN INJURED ANKLE TO SEND THE CHIEFS TO THE SUPER BOWL ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øpic.twitter.com/FymfvnNpyD ‚Äî Guru (@DrGuru_) January 30, 2023</p>
<p>More than two weeks have passed since the injury, and he‚Äôs probably going to be okay in Super Bowl LVII. Still, his teammates will have to do a fine job to give him protection. In the past, that was a problem, but the 2023 Chiefs have been brilliant in guarding their quarterback.</p>
<p>As a result, Mahomes has been able to take his time and make the best-possible passing choices. Most of those passes ended up caught by Travis Kelce, who‚Äôs the NFL‚Äôs second-best TD scorer, with just two fewer than leader Davante Adams (Las Vegas Raiders).</p>
<p>Knowing all this, the Chiefs have absolutely nothing to worry about their offense, but what about their defense? Although it‚Äôs not their strongest weapon, these guys have been doing well defensively this year. In their two games of the NFL Playoffs, they conceded only 40 points in total despite playing against very tough offenses ‚Äì Jacksonville Jaguars (NFL‚Äôs 9th scoring offense) and Cincinnati Bengals (5th).</p>
<p>Philadelphia‚Äôs Toughest Challenge is Left for the End</p>
<p>The Eagles were brilliant in the regular season, finishing as the No. 1 seed in the NFC, scoring more points than any other team in the conference. Led by Jalen Hurts, their offense was nothing short of brilliant in the regular part of the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Jalen Hurts is the youngest QB in history to reach a Super Bowl.</p>

<p>Still, the fact is that Philly‚Äôs schedule wasn‚Äôt too difficult. Arguably the toughest opponent they played against is their NFC East rival, Dallas. They went 1-1 with the Cowboys in the regular season.</p>
<p>Then, in the postseason, Nick Sirianni‚Äôs boys got to play against the New York Giants, who were very lucky to get so far. It was clear that the Giants had no place there, so it‚Äôs no surprise the Eagles blew them out 38-7 in the Divisional Round.</p>
<p>Their best performance of the 2022-23 season happened in the Conference Championship game. They won the NFC by destroying the San Francisco 49ers 31-7. Sure, the Niners did play with third-string QB, but that‚Äôs not taking anything away from Philly‚Äôs achievement.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles vs Kansas City Chiefs Prediction</p>
<p>We think the Kansas City Chiefs are the better team. Not only do they got the talent, but they also have the experience needed to win the biggest game of them all. We do, expect to see a big battle on the field, with both offenses doing great. As a result, this could turn out to be one of the most entertaining Super Bowls in years.</p>
<p>Picks: Kansas City Chiefs to win; over to hit</p>
