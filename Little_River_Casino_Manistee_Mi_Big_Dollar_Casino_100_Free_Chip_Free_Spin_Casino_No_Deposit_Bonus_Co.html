<p>Super Bowl results remain strong, but not setting any records, regulators have reported on the post-betting results.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Betting Drives Strong Results</p>
<p>Super Bowl LIV brought all the excitement America expected after the Kansas City Chiefs threw a dramatic upset, sealing the final game with a convincing 31-20.</p>
<p>Yet, Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs star quarterback, had cost plenty of bettors a decent penny after he finished with 29 yards rushing, beating all punters expectations and specifically what most prop bets predicted about the man.</p>
<p>Yet, the Super Bowl served its intended purpose – it was an exercise in showmanship and high-level football and it excited a lot of betting interest on Sunday, with the total amount wagered in New Jersey alone reaching $54.2 million.</p>
<p>This amount far exceeded last year’s $34.8 million wagered by gamblers in New Jersey during Super Bowl 53. Nevada’s results didn’t quite manage to hit their intended mark, with sportsbooks reportedly claiming just shy of $150 million.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, however, one casino in Nevada had technical difficulties in compiling data, which may have caused for a slightly worse performance overall. The media agency was citing the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Multi-Million Wins on the Day of the Super Bowl</p>
<p>Multiple properties around the U.S. have reported steady winnings, with MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment both claiming multimillion wins off the latest Super Bowl and particularly in Nevada. However, New Jersey didn’t quite throw the same weight into the betting ring, with all 10 retail sportsbooks in the state reporting somewhat subdued results.</p>
<p>The same applied to the 19 mobile sports betting apps available to New Jersey players. On the flipside, Ron Baumann, Caesars Entertainment’ boss for Atlantic City casinos, has said that visitation has been high – “We sold out every seat we had, every inch of seating,” Baumann said cited by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Super Bowl Total Handle Across the United States.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, regulators have also been releasing their numbers off the Super Bowl game on Sunday. Mississippi, for example, registered some $6.7 million in total placed bets on the event. However, the watchdog hasn’t yet figured out how much was won back by patrons.</p>
<p>Rhode Island, on the other side, saw subdued results, as the New England Patriots couldn’t make it into the NFL grand finale this year. That reflected on the results, with the total handle reaching $5.5 million, lower than 2019’s $6.5 million.</p>
<p>Overall, the results were good, Rhode Island’s regulator said. Meanwhile, New Hampshire posted some $2.3 million wagered on the Super Bowl, after NH officially launched sports betting back in December, 2019.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, NH Lottery Chief Charlie McIntyre said that this was only the first step for the state and that further contests should bring in more profit overall.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive (RSI) successfully launched a new brand just ahead of the Super Bowl weekend – although not necessarily connected with Super Bowl gambling. RSI introduced the BetRivers.com casino in Pennsylvania last week – the second online gaming property managed by the company in the Keystone State, after Play SugarHouse.com.</p>
<p>Originally, the sportsbook launched in October 2019, so the latest casino launch was just a way to complement the company’s existing offer. Pennsylvania is also expected to release its full Super Bowl results later today.</p>
