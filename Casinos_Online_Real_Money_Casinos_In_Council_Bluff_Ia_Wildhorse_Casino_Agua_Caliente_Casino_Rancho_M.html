<p>Ignition Casino has every reason to be proud of itself. Created in 2016 by Lynton Limited, the company behind other successful gaming establishments, and not least Bovada and Ignition Poker, has brought years of experience into forging a quality iGaming product you can enjoy today. Players looking to benefit from a fantastic $3,000 sign-up offer and some of the finest Rival Gaming and Real Time Gaming (RTG).</p>
<p>We were satisfied with what we discovered humming under the Ignition Casino hood and are here to share it with you. Our Ignition Casino review sets out to find everything you need to know. Let’s start with a quick look-through of the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Why Is Ignition Casino Worth Your Time?</p>
<p>We were pleased to discover a casino that hasn’t shied away from adopting the latest trends in the industry and benefiting from a well-timed entry into the iGaming market. Here is what our Ignition Casino review discovered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Excellent $1000 Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>A Special Deposit Bitcoin Welcome Package</p>
<p>Good Bonus Wagering Requirements</p>
<p>Live Dealer Games and Detailed Previews</p>
<p>A Great No-Download Mobile-Friendly Client</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Withdrawals</p>
<p>Dedicated Live Chat Support and Email</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Doesn’t Have an Official License</p>
<p>The Games Library Could Be Expanded</p>
<p>Ignition Casino Welcome Package</p>
<p>It all starts with a simple deposit. You need to put down $20 to activate the Ignition Casino deposit bonus but watch out. There are two bonuses to choose from. One will match up your money up to $1,500 at a 150% rate if you choose to deposit with Bitcoin. The other will allow you to get up to $1,000 matched at 100% if you choose to deposit with a credit card.</p>
<p>Both are subject to the same wagering requirement which means it’s not any hassle to pick either one. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts though are bound to appreciate the neat little BTC package, which will offer more bang for your buck.</p>
<p>Even then, we found both bonuses to be doing very well, specifically because of the wagering requirements. Let’s talk about these now.</p>
<p>Bonus Requirements: What You Need to Know</p>
<p>Every bonus can be too tempting unless you look into the fine script. You will find all the small details that will let you see if a bonus is truly worth it. At a great match rate for both the BTC and FIAT bonus, Ignition Casino leaves no room for doubt.</p>
<p>The bonuses are claimed when you place a minimum deposit worth at least $20. Once you have your bonus money, it’s time to subject it to the wagering requirements – a mere 25x for both the deposit and bonus in this case.</p>
<p>This is not too bad at all. If you do end up depositing the full $1,000 amount with your bank card, you will need to wager $50,000 before you can cash out your winnings. Better yet, we didn’t find a specific cap on how much you can win while using a bonus, so anything you win with the bonus is yours for the taking.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep an eye out for is the wagering contributions. In other words, what parts of your bet contribute towards the wagering. Every game type will be slightly different as per Ignition Casino’s Wagering Contribution Chart. Here is the full breakdown for the Welcome Bonus specifically.</p>
<p>Slots, Specialty Games (all types) – 100%</p>
<p>Table Games (unless stated otherwise) – 60%</p>
<p>Video Poker (all types) &amp; Blackjack (unless stated otherwise) – 30%</p>
<p>Single Deck &amp; Double Deck Blackjack, Roulette, Baccarat – 5%</p>
<p>Craps &amp; Live Dealer (all types) – 0%</p>
<p>You can get a decent 60% off table games which really is something. Of course, you have to factor that the most strategic games, such as roulette and baccarat are relegated to a mere 5%, but this is no biggie. There are still plenty of gems to try your hands at!</p>
<p>Ignition Casino Promotions: Putting Good Mileage In</p>
<p>Have you stuck around past the welcome bonus? This means that just like ourselves, you have come to appreciate the casino and share the community opinion. Ignition Casino is indeed a place where you can look at some handy offers.</p>
<p>For those of you looking to top up their bankrolls, the Ignition Casino Weekly Boost will help you catch yourself up on a great $100 bonus. The promotion is a 100% match bonus that you can redeem with a bonus code. The bonus can be claimed once per player during a promotional week. Next, you have the loyalty program, Ignition Miles, which will help you</p>
<p>Ignition Rewards: Time to Turn Your Miles into Money</p>
<p>Players who stick around will undoubtedly benefit from Ignition Rewards. This is a loyalty program designed for every player at the casino without any particular expectations from the player.</p>
<p>Everyone who participates in the casino will begin to accumulate Ignition Miles which can be used to redeem for real money or you can use them to keep climbing through the levels. There are 8 tier levels, the lowest being Steel and the highest Diamond.</p>
<p>All Platinum+ players will be eligible for special birthday bonuses, which is a nice touch on the part of the casino. Every $1 wagered on slot games brings you 5 Ignition Miles and specialty games will grant you 15 on every $1 you bet on them.</p>
<p>Ignition Casino: What Makes the Casino Tick Over?</p>
<p>The software used at Ignition Casino allows for smooth gameplay and easy way to enjoy yourself to some quality gaming experience. There is no need to download the Ignition platform to start playing.</p>
<p>Everything is loaded instantly in the browser and you can play from any operating system and device. Whether you enjoy smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers as your preferred gaming medium, you will find the experience rewarding and Ignition Casino waiting to offer some brilliant, player-friendly gameplay.</p>
<p>So Many Great Casino Games to Try at Ignition</p>
<p>With an awesome touched-up user interface that now makes the Android experience even better, Ignition Casino has done a great job of keeping its offer up to date. There are over 300 games on the casino now, most of which have been developed by Rival Gaming and Real Time Gaming (RTG), a pair of companies that stand out with the quality of their product.</p>
<p>Today, Ignition Casino offers entertaining gaming solutions across a range of available categories to make the experience more comprehensive, but also give you a way of picking the specific gaming segment you would enjoy the most.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slots are the first segment we will take a look at. They represent the bulk of the offer, with at least 25 progressive jackpots. Once you click on the Slots section, you will find a variety of filters that allow you to micromanage your search and look up specific games such as i-Slots, Reel Series, Video Slots, 3D Slots. There are some excellent new releases you can try right now, including:</p>
<p>Dragon Siege</p>
<p>Gods of Luxor</p>
<p>Fairy Wins</p>
<p>Gold Rush Gus</p>
<p>Bess and Becky</p>
<p>You will notice that Ignition Casino has begun adding multiple new titles to its offer, building quite the impressive portfolio of games. The slots you end up playing are colorful, graphically rich, and introduce a few new game mechanics that make the experience all the more satisfying.</p>
<p>Other favorites of ours include Reign of Gnomes and Multiplier Man and they all come with some game-changing mechanics that will make it absolutely worth it to give them a go.</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>There are fewer blackjack games than slots, this is certainly the case. Yet, the payout is decent and the return to player stands at above 99.22% offering a great way to enjoy the available games, but also turn a penny to the side. You can pick from multiple mobile-friendly blackjack versions here, such as:</p>
<p>Single Deck Blackjack</p>
<p>Double Deck Blackjack</p>
<p>Classic Blackjack</p>
<p>European Blackjack</p>
<p>Perfect Pairs</p>
<p>Blackjack is great fun to play and the game’s status in the United States is certainly a big draw for many players. You will find Ignition Casino fully equipped to provide you with some of the finest versions as well.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Video poker has always been a niche form of entertainment, but players have become aware of the upsides, and specifically the high payout rate. With simplistic yet rewarding gameplay, video poker is a player favorite, although it takes a special mind to appreciate the strategy-driven game. Great picks include:</p>
<p>Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Jacks or Better</p>
<p>Double Jackpot Poker</p>
<p>Bonus Poker</p>
<p>Jacks or Better 10 Hands</p>
<p>There are many great iterations of the popular game you will find absolutely spot on and be willing to try yourself. This version of poker allows you to theoretically beat the house and win over 100% of your bet size.</p>
<p>Table Games</p>
<p>Table games are a bit of a blanket term but it successfully captures the 28+ games listed in this category. You will find many updated versions, too, as Ignition Casino is constantly streamlining its offering new games or simply improving the software of some older games. You can play the majority of the gems you will find in this category on mobile thanks to HTML5. Great games here include:</p>
<p>Roll the Dice</p>
<p>Teen Patti Pro</p>
<p>Pai Gow Poker</p>
<p>European Roulette</p>
<p>Vegas Three Card Rummy</p>
<p>The cards you will find here are definitely worth a shot. They are different than what you would see in most other casinos, but that’s what makes them all the more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Specialty Games</p>
<p>A great casino experience should always feel special and Ignition Casino Online has many games to live up to this expectation. The Specialty Games section may not look like much at first blush, but you can rest assured it’s packing some pretty exciting and innovative games, such as:</p>
<p>Pesca Bingo</p>
<p>Pirates Pillage</p>
<p>Cast for Cash</p>
<p>Amazonia Bingo</p>
<p>Bingo Cataratas</p>
<p>These games are unlike others you will find at Ignition Casino and, clearly, bingo is one of the main games to try here. In the future, we could see Ignition getting a little bolder and perhaps opening a dedicated bingo hall, which wouldn’t be at all surprising since you can already bet on sports and play real poker at the website.</p>
<p>Ignition Casino Live Dealer Games</p>
<p>If you do insist on having a good time, a quick stop to the Live Dealers section is mandatory. Ignition leaves nothing to the imagination, posting a very detailed breakdown of what you can expect in terms of games, available seats, and table limits.</p>
<p>Most games start at $5 and go all the way up to $2,500 or $3,000. You may lift these limits by becoming a loyal player at the casino as well. From the available games, you can pick from all the table classics, including Blackjack Early Payout, Classic Blackjack, American Roulette, Baccarat, Super 6, and more.</p>
<p>You can choose your own seat or enjoy an unlimited and fully scalable version of almost every game you find as well. All in all, Ignition Casino makes it easy for US players to play live dealer games without ever having to leave your own home or, if you do, you can play with a mobile device instead of visiting an actual casino.</p>
<p>Ignition Casino Deposits and Payouts: How Fast Are They?</p>
<p>Cashouts can be very quick at Ignition Casino. You will usually have to put up with 48 hours pending time, but once this is sorted, you can expect your Bitcoin cashout to be completed within 15 minutes. For checks, though, you will need to wait between 10 and 15 business days, which is not ideal for some players. Other popular payment options include Bank Wire Transfer, Neosurf, Flexepin, and of course various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>On the flip side, you have deposits that are instant, allowing you to minimize the time you spend worrying about your money being processed. The maximum cashout amount you can request around $10,000 every three days as per the T&amp;C’s. The casino allows you to also deposit as little as $10.</p>
<p>Have a Bone to Pick? Casino Complaints</p>
<p>One of the surest ways to tell if a casino is actually worth it is to have a quick look around. Complaints against operators do not go unnoticed and they are discussed online and featured in every review. Ignition Casino has a very high clearance rate at the leading resolution websites. At the time of the review, we didn’t see a reason for concern.</p>
<p>The casino has successfully resolved all problems it has had with players within 120 hours and as far as we could see, the pending complaints were already tended by the customer support staff. Not least, it’s very easy to launch your own complaints against Ignition Casino if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Customer Service: Get Instant Help</p>
<p>Do you feel you need assistance to navigate Ignition Casino? The casino has trustworthy and reliable customer support that will help you solve any issue you might have with the casino. Whether this has to do with the casino, bonuses, or cashouts, you can expect to find detailed information in the Help Center.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to troubleshoot issues by yourself, there is an easy way to just jump in a live chat with a customer care representative and have any issue solved quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
