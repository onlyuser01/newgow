<p>Last weekend, the New England Patriots obliterated the Jets 54-13, which was their biggest win since December 2020. The team they demolished 45-0 back then was the LA Chargers.</p>
<p>Is it time for the LA team to get its revenge? Oddsmakers think so ahead of their Week 8 clash.</p>

<p>Chargers Ready for the Payback</p>
<p>The Chargers had two weeks to prepare for the game with the Patriots due to a bye in Week 7. It’s very likely that they’ve been working on improving their defensive play. With 150 points allowed in six games, their defense is among the league’s worst.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that their defensive form seems to be on a downward path. In the two previous games, they conceded 76 points.</p>
<p>Their passing defense has been okay, but they rank bottom when it comes to run defense, namely in total allowed yards and yards given up per carry.</p>
<p>The bad news for the Chargers is that the Patriots’ running backs have been playing superb football lately.</p>
<p>Patriots Look Real Good Offensively</p>
<p>The Patriots destroyed the New York Jets in Week 7, scoring 54 points along the way, which was their best offensive performance in years.</p>
<p>Rookie quarterback Mac Jones had a vintage game, going 24/36 for 307 yards. Two of his throws resulted in a touchdown, while the backup QB Kendrick Bourne also threw a touchdown pass.</p>

<p>On top of that, the Pats rushing game was also amazing, with four rushing touchdowns. Running backs Damien Harris and J. J. Taylor scored two touchdowns each.</p>
<p>That was the third straight game with Taylor recording a rushing touchdown. So far, he has a total of five TDs to his name.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Pats look really good – they’re on a series of three games with 25+ points scored. Their defense hasn’t been that great, although they did hold the Jets to just 13 points last weekend.</p>
<p>Sure, the Jets are horrible in the offense, with just 80 points in six games. They probably aren’t going to be able to do the same against the Chargers.</p>
<p>Still, we probably aren’t going to see them concede more than usual. They’re conceding 20 points per game, a stat that probably isn’t going to be tarnished in Week 8.</p>
<p>With all that said, the best betting option seems to be backing the Pats not to lose by a too large margin.</p>
<p>Pick: Patriots +4; under 49.5 should hit in this game.</p>
