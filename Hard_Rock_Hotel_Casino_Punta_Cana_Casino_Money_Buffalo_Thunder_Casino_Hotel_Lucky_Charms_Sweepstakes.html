    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Casino Money Buffalo Thunder Casino Hotel Lucky Charms Sweepstakes</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a serious problem with Sloto'Cash Casino. I registered for an account in January and deposited $220. I had some good luck playing slots and my account balance was $4,681. To withdraw they sent me an email to request my ID and a bill which I sent and they approved. They then asked me for an alternative ID and bill along with some selfies. Again I sent everything they requested quickly.</p>
<p>Sloto'Cash then responded to me that "Dear Rosa,We are contacting you from Slotocash Casino.Your account has been reviewed, and the decision has been made to permanently close your account, as it did not pass our security checks.Any winnings derived have been voided. This decision will not be reversed.</p>
<p>In the event that a new account is created under your name, it will be closed.</p>
<p>Regards,".</p>
<p>I sent them emails asking what they are talking about and what I did wrong, but they just send me the same thing that they are going to close my account and keep my money. I have done nothing wrong. I didn't break any rules that I know of or that they told me. They are just disgracefully stealing my money.</p>
