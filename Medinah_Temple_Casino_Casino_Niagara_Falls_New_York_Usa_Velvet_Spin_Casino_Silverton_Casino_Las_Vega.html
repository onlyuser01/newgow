<p>Manufacturer and distributor of sports betting products SUZOHAPP announced its presence in Ontario has expanded following the installation of its sports betting terminals at Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.</p>
<p>Preparing to Launch Sports Betting</p>
<p>SUZOHAPP has deployed its sports betting terminals at the two land-based casino properties in Ontario following partnership deals with Mohegan and RBY Gaming, and once the two casinos launch sports betting, the manufacturer’s terminals will be the terminals that will be offering wagering on sports at the venues.</p>
<p>Hailing Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara as “premier locations in the Ontario sports betting industries,” SUZOHAPP’s vice president of Sales, Todd Sims, expressed his delight at being able to partner with the casinos and RBY Gaming and contribute to the project.</p>
<p>Following the full approval from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), SUZOHAPP deployed at the Mohegan properties its SBT-1000, a terminal combining elite podium-style with a sleek design and minimal footprint, and SBT-OTC, an over-the-counter unit operating on the same hardware base and allowing easy transactions for both cashiers and customers.</p>
<p>Richard Taylor, president of Niagara Casinos, commented on the news, “excited to partner with SUZOHAPP” as part of the preparations to introduce sports betting at Fallsview Resort Casino and Casino Niagara, convinced that the partnership will serve to elevate the casino operator’s offerings at both casinos.</p>
<p>“With the changing landscape in gaming, we have been working collaboratively with the OLG, AGCO and the Province and are excited to launch sports betting in Ontario,” he concluded.</p>
<p>With over 60 years of serving operators and original equipment manufacturers, SUZOHAPP offers a complete ecosystem of sports betting products, as well as customization and automation of the entire betting cycle. SUZOHAPP is partnering with RBY Gaming for Canadian distribution.</p>
<p>‘Imperative’ to Utilize Technology</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, president and chief executive officer of Mohegan, commented that for Mohegan, “it is imperative [to] align strategically with brands” that will bring innovation and provide its guests with “state-of-the-art technology to enhance their experience.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to partner with SUZOHAPP and to introduce their sports betting products to our properties in Niagara,” he added.</p>
<p>The rollout of SUZOHAPP’s sports betting terminals at the two Niagara Casinos’ properties is further strengthening the betting equipment manufacturer’s presence in the Canadian province following a previous deployment of its terminals with Great Canadian Entertainment (GCE) last month.</p>
<p>The agreement with GCE saw SUZOHAPP supply the land-based casino operator with sports betting terminals at ten locations in Ontario, launching the first-ever sports betting terminals in the province.</p>
