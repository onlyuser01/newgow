<p>The leading partnerships agency specializing in commercial partnerships and management, Entourage Sport &amp; Entertainment, announced a new collaboration for the iconic boxer, Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>BRBet.com Selects Mike Tyson for Brand Ambassador in Brazil</p>
<p>Details of the new deal emerged Friday and see the legendary boxer become a regional ambassador for BRBet.com in Brazil. As a regional ambassador for BRBet.com, Tyson will participate exclusively in different sportsbook and betting activations for the operator in the country. Entourage explained that the new deal will bring social media as well as print advertising. Tyson will also participate in content shoots which will be distributed via different channels.</p>
<p>The first activation between BRBet.com and Tyson portrays the famous boxer working out in a private residence in Rio De Janeiro. Then, the famous boxer takes a bowl of popcorn and enjoys a soccer game on TV. At some point, he gets angry that he cannot find the right bet for him, and this is when he picks up a smartphone with the app “BRBet, A Bet do Brasil.” He then scrolls through the app that enables the placing of safe and fast sports bets.</p>
<p>Entourage is famous for partnership management, talent management and negotiation of sports and entertainment sponsorships. The company has a solid reputation within the growing industry and has helped facilitate many partnerships that delivered different marketing objectives. As a globally recognized agency that specializes in partnerships, Entourage has collaborated sponsorships with leading global organizations such as Konami, Emirates Airlines, FTX, Visa and even Heineken. What’s more, the company has collaborated with rights holders such as Inter Milan, SL Benfica, FIFA and UEFA.</p>
<p>Former Professional Athletes Join Forces with Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The latest deal comes as no surprise as many athletes join forces with sports betting operators. In fact, only recently, the sports betting operator that primarily focuses on Asia, FUN88, announced a new collaboration with Ilker Casillas, the Spanish former professional soccer player. Thanks to the new collaboration, Casillas was designated as brand ambassador for FUN88 just ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar which is set to kick off on November 20 and run through December 18.</p>
<p>Before that, back in October, Betway expanded its portfolio of ambassadors by adding the former soccer star Robbie Keane as a brand ambassador. Becoming a brand ambassador for Betway saw Keane bring unique content for sports fans via the operator’s online sports blog, Betway Insider. At the time of the announcement, the famous soccer player said that it is exciting to join Betway just ahead of the World Cup. He explained that he will bring unique insight to fans of the sport thanks to the latest collaboration.</p>
