    <h1>Cashman Casino 15 Million Free Coins Miami Casino Hotel Hard Rock Hotel Casino Atlantic City Casino</h1>

<p>The gambling regulator in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Gambling Supervisory Authority, constantly monitors the gambling operators in the country and imposes fines or other sanctions in case it uncovers breaches of the established regulations. Amber Gaming, a betting and gaming operator in the country, was the latest operator to fall under the Authority’s scrutiny. On Tuesday, the gambling watchdog revealed that it imposed a €15,000 ($15,900) fine against the operator, citing breaches of the Law on Gambling in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The latest fine comes after the Authority was contacted by a bettor earlier this year. In May, the bettor filed a complaint, claiming that Amber Gaming limited their betting offers. At the time, the person claimed that the gambling operator did not confirm a reason why the restriction was implemented.</p>
<p>When Amber Gaming was approached by the Authority about the case in question, the company said that the person who filed a complaint had completed some 279 sports wagers. It explained that data regarding his activities was not disclosed as it was “considered confidential and constitutes the company’s commercial secret.” Moreover, Amber Gaming said that data regarding the player’s activities was not published after a decision was taken by a compliance manager.</p>
<p>The response of the betting operator pushed the Authority to conduct an “unplanned special inspection.” In particular, the gambling watchdog sought to determine if Amber Gaming complies with the established gambling regulations in the country. Despite the probe, the Authority uncovered that the reasons why the operator limited the betting options for the client that filed a complaint were not disclosed. As a result, the gambling regulator concluded that those actions were in violation of Article 18, paragraph 1 of the Law on Gambling of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>
<p>The Fine Isn’t the First for Amber Gaming This Year</p>
<p>Details regarding the latest regulatory sanction come after the gambling regulator imposed another fine earlier this month. At the time, the Authority hit the Lithuanian online casino and sports betting operator, Top Sport, with a fine of nearly $27,000, claiming breaches related to the provision of services to a self-excluded individual.</p>
<p>The aforementioned fine was the second one for Top Sport since the start of the year. However, the most recent financial sanction from the Authority is also the second penalty against Amber Gaming as well. Back in February, the gambling watchdog issued a €6,000 ($6,400) fine against the operator. This was the result of an investigation that uncovered Amber Gaming sent two e-mails between June and August 2022 that allegedly drew the attention of the clients to its website.</p>
