<p>A woman was arrested this week on charges related to the theft of $90,000 worth of casino chips from a man. The two apparently met at the High Limit Lounge at Las Vegas’ Aria Casino. During the course of the night, she allegedly slipped him some kind of drug.</p>

<p>When the unnamed man later woke up in his hotel room at the Vdara Hotel &amp; Spa on June 9, his chips were gone. He also spotted an empty capsule with some kind of residue nearby.</p>
<p>It appears during the night he was gambling at a high roller table at the Aria. He got $50,000 by using a credit card at a cashier. A friend at the casino provided him with an additional $40,000.</p>
<p>But he recalls that during his night, “things got blurry” and he became dizzy, according to reports from KLAS. He reported having a few drinks at the casino’s High Limit Lounge. But he did not have clear recollections of the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Caught on Tape</p>
<p>On Monday, Metro police arrested Ebony Bairfield, 40, of Las Vegas. She had been spotted in casino surveillance video, police said.</p>
<p>Bairfield confirmed the woman in a surveillance video was her. But she told police she did not know the victim. She said she meets men who provide her money, but claims she is not a prostitute, KLAS reported, based on a police report.</p>
<p>Bairfield was charged with administering a drug to aid in the commission of felony, burglary, and grand larceny, KLAS said. She was once charged with an unrelated prostitution-related theft, the report adds.</p>
<p>When police searched her, they located a key for a Vdara hotel room in her purse , KLAS said.</p>
<p>She was placed in the Clark County Detention Center. She remained in custody as of Thursday, according to online jail records.</p>
<p>Similar Arrest</p>
<p>Earlier this month, an alleged prostitute swiped a Patek Philippe watch from a man at an unnamed Las Vegas Strip hotel, cops said. The watch is valued at about $100,000. The man believes he was drugged by the suspect.</p>
<p>The woman, later identified as Sarah Richards, 32, of Las Vegas, was seen later at a different Strip hotel by an undercover Las Vegas Metro officer. She began speaking about prostitution to him, police said.</p>
<p>Based on her conversation, she was charged with prostitution-related counts, according to KLAS. She also was charged with burglary and grand larceny for the watch theft, KLAS added.</p>
<p>The owner of the watch claimed Richards first met him in the hotel’s bar. The two then went up to his hotel room. Richards told him she needed “help with money,” the report said. He gave her between $1,000 and a couple of thousand dollars. He eventually fell asleep in the room. A few hours later, he awoke and found his watch missing from his wrist.</p>
<p>Earlier, Richards was arrested for prostitution charges linked to different incidents, KLAS said. She also had warrants pending for soliciting prostitution, the report adds.</p>
<p>Men Allegedly Drugged</p>
<p>Last year, a woman was accused of drugging a man at the Lift bar at the Aria Casino and stealing his $40,000 Rolex watch. She was charged with grand larceny.</p>
<p>Three other men made similar claims against another woman. Windy Rose Jones, 23, of Las Vegas, allegedly drugged men at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas on two different occasions and stole watches.</p>
<p>She also stole a watch from a man she met at the Wynn Las Vegas. The two later went to a hookah lounge, police said. The man later woke up at the Venetian hotel valet area. He believes he was drugged.</p>
<p>One watch was a $37,000 Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. A second watch was a $45,000 Rolex Daytona. A third watch allegedly stolen by Jones was a $45,000 Rolex.</p>
