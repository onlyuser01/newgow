    <h1>Allentown Casino Hyatt Place Uncasville Casino Area Pennsylvania Online Casinos Shazam Casino Cincin</h1>

<p>A Slotegrator said that the popularity of casino streaming cannot be ignored</p>
<p>Livespins’ innovative social casino product has been integrated into Slotegrator, a leading software supplier and aggregator for online casino and sportsbook operators. As a result, the latter company will be able to offer socially-charged casino experiences to its clients.</p>
<p>The distribution agreement will see Slotegrator distribute Livespins in multiple markets, capitalizing on the demand for casino and slot streaming. Livespins is a product that is well-suited to answer these demands thanks to its innovative concept.</p>
<p>Allowing fans to bet behind their favorite streamer, brand ambassador or celebrity, Livespins turns gambling into a shared experience. Each player can select their own number of spins and bet size and see what others bet too. The social element is further reinforced by engaging chat capabilities that allow players to comment and react with gifs and emojis.</p>
<p>Engagement is further reinforced by Lightning Drops, a jackpot mechanic that can trigger at any time. Lightning Races, on the other hand, allows players to compete against one another to score the highest score on a leaderboard.</p>
<p>Offering games from multiple leading studios, Livespins aims to create an amicable betting environment where players have fun regardless of whether they are winning or losing. Since Livespins sits within the casino lobby, players can also benefit from all the safer gambling tools offered by operators.</p>
<p>The social casino product is expected to be a great new addition to Slotegrator, which has quickly cemented itself as a leading content aggregator. The company currently offers content from more than 100 companies.</p>
<p>The Popularity of Casino Streaming Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>Slotegrator’s business development manager, Ayvar Gabidullin, commented on the distribution deal. He said that his team is always trying to onboard cutting-edge content that would channel operators toward Slotegrator.</p>
<p>Gabidullin added that the popularity of casino streaming cannot be understated, which is why his team sought this partnership.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to ignore the popularity of casino streaming and this partnership with Livespins enables us to deliver this to our partners and their players responsibly and compliantly. Partnerships such as this with Livespins ensure we stay ahead of the game. Ayvar Gabidullin, business development manager, Slotegrator</p>
<p>Livespins’ chief commercial officer, Michael Pedersen, also commented on the partnership, praising Slotegrator as a “top-flight” content provider and aggregator. Commenting on the growing popularity of casino streaming, Pedersen said:</p>
<p>The demand for this is at an all-time high, and Livespins allows operators to tap into this in a unique way that ultimately offers players an entirely new way of experiencing online casino while being responsible and compliant. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>Pedersen concluded that his team is thrilled to team up with Slotegrator.</p>
<p>A week ago, Livespins penned a similar agreement with Gamingtec. Prior to that, the company’s product was also integrated into Soft2Bet.</p>
