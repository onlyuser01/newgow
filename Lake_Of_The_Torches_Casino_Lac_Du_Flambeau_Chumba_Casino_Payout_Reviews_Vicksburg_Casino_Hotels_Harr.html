<p>Dear Avram,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://casino360.bet/en/terms:</p>
<p>2.1.2. You are not allowed to register on the Website and use our services if you are a resident of Curacao, France, Iran, Iraq, Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, Spain, St Maarten, Statia, U.S.A or the U.S.A dependencies, Ukraine, United Kingdom. We reserve the right to refuse customers from any other countries over and above the aforementioned jurisdictions at our own discretion."</p>
<p>It seems that you shouldn’t have been allowed to create an account in the first place.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Since the website is not blocked for France and there is a possibility to register an account from a restricted country (please see the screenshots below) and deposit funds, I would like to ask you to forward details of your casino account. Have you submitted France as your country of residence?</p>
<p>Your ratification is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
