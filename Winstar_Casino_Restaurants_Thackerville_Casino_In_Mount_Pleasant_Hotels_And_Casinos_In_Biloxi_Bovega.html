<p>As Sendra steps in as CEO, the COO role will be filled by Ramon Glieneke</p>
<p>Alea, a live data-driven casino game aggregator, has welcomed Jordi Sendra as its new chief executive. The new appointment follows incumbent CEO Alex Tomic’s decision to step down.</p>
<p>This marks a major shift for the firm as Tomic has been at the helm ever since Alea was founded in 2012. The current chief will step back from day-to-day operations, instead returning to a non-executive role. Tomic’s plan is to refocus on the company’s overall strategy in emerging markets, including Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sendra will step in as CEO following a three-year stint as the chief operating officer of the company. Prior to this, Sendra served as managing director at Fapp Sistemas de Aspiración for five years. Earlier, he spent over two years at Synergic Partners, a business consultancy.</p>
<p>As Sendra steps in as CEO, his previous role will be filled by Ramon Glieneke. As Alea’s new COO, the latter will be responsible for the company’s day-to-day operations. To that end, Glieneke will leverage years of experience in API aggregation.</p>
<p>Sendra Is Excited to Lead Alea</p>
<p>Alea representatives commented on the corporate reshuffling. Sendra himself spoke on his new appointment, saying that he has personally seen Alea’s business evolve into “one of the most exciting aggregator platforms” in the industry. Because of that, he is looking forward to leading the aggregation specialist.</p>
<p>I’m delighted that Alex and the team have put their trust in me to lead this company forward and I’m also very excited to welcome Ramon to the team. Jordi Sendra, CEO, Alea</p>
<p>Sendra added that his company is always looking for “new and incredibly talented people” from outside of the iGaming industry to join Alea’s team. He praised the API aggregation experience Glieneke has gained from working within the travel sector and added that it will provide Alea with a “whole new level of knowledge and perspective.” This will ensure the company’s success moving forward, Sendra believes.</p>
<p>Glieneke also shared his thoughts on the new appointment, calling it a “fantastic opportunity” to test his vast aggregation experience. He praised Alea as one of the fastest-growing iGaming companies, saying that he is looking forward to working with Sendra.</p>
<p>The new COO said: “Alea is one of the fastest growing companies in this space and I’m thrilled to be given the position of COO and look forward to supporting Jordi as we go from strength to strength.”</p>
