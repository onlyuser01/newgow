    <h1>Crypto Casino Online Casino Bonus Ohne Einzahlung Casino Live Casinos Near By Casino Royale Poster M</h1>

<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with this casino.</p>
<p>I signed up with them not long ago.</p>
<p>I took the welcome bonus, which is a pack of 5 bonuses.</p>
<p>I deposited in crypto. Every time, there's a problem applying this pack.</p>
<p>So, I was at my third deposit of this pack having received the first two.</p>
<p>However, the bonus I selected when making my deposit didn't get applied, which has happened to me before.</p>
<p>I know this casino has numerous connection issues, as we often get disconnected in the middle of a game, etc...</p>
<p>So tonight, I went into the chat to tell them that the bonus I selected from the pack didn't get added to my deposit.</p>
<p>They said they would go verify and do the needful. I waited and waited... and suddenly, I was disconnected!</p>
<p>I return to the chat, thinking it was a bug, I explain the issue again.</p>
<p>Immediately I am disconnected again without explanation!</p>
<p>Now I'm starting to find this strange... I re-enter the chat and ask them why I'm constantly being disconnected.</p>
<p>They tell me they don't know, and I have to state my issue again. Then disconnected again!</p>
<p>Anyway... every time I went there and tried to resolve my problem, I was disconnected!</p>
<p>The last person, just now, I asked them not to disconnect me, or at least to resolve my issue if I happen to get disconnected, as I wouldn't be able to play! They said "Ok".</p>
<p>I ask them again why I am constantly being disconnected, their response: "I don't know".</p>
<p>They make me wait for a long time, return and ask me to be patient etc... then again I'm disconnected from the chat!</p>
<p>Unbelievable, I've never seen anything like this before!</p>
<p>I decided to send them an email, and I see that this last person has sent me an email! Actually, while I was waiting, they were writing me an email! Makes no sense...</p>
<p>In the email, they say that they have decided not to grant me any bonus. Without any explanation!</p>
<p>Being new to their site, and not playing a lot, I don't understand.</p>
<p>I replied to them saying that I took the welcome pack that comes with 5 bonuses when I signed up.</p>
<p>I was therefore expecting them to apply the third bonus, or refund me in this case.</p>
<p>Because this is the only reason I made a deposit, as I had 100% available with my deposit.</p>
<p>I should also mention that on my first two deposits with this bonus, I won both times. Is this what's bothering them?</p>
<p>Also, my account has been fully verified and validated with selfies etc...</p>
<p>I'm coming to you to ask for either a refund of this deposit or for them to apply the bonus.</p>
<p>But I won't lie, this unfortunate experience doesn't make me want to play with them anymore.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
