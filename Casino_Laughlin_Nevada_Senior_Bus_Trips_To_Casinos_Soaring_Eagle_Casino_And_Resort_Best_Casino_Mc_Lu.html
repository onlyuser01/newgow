<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming operator, BetMGM, announced a new collaboration with the American actress and singer, Vanessa Hudgens.</p>
<p>Vanessa Hudgens Teams up with BetMGM</p>
<p>The terms of the new deal, announced Thursday, see Hudgens become a celebrity brand ambassador for BetMGM. Under the collaboration, the singer, actress and entrepreneur will participate in different campaigns as well as promotions for the iGaming operator. What’s more, Hudgens will collaborate with BetMGM for social media activations and content promoting its casino and iGaming platforms.</p>
<p>“Vanessa Hudgens is extremely gifted and will be instrumental in BetMGM’s ongoing evolution as an entertainment company.“ Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer at BetMGM</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement about the recent deal, BetMGM’s chief revenue officer, Matt Prevost, acknowledged that Hudgens is incredibly talented. According to him, the new partnership will further boost BetMGM’s position as a leading entertainment company. Last but not least, Prevost said that BetMGM is looking forward to seeing the success the new collaboration will bring by expanding its reach to new audiences.</p>
<p>“We look forward to the partnership and her support in our goal of reaching new audiences in unique and engaging ways,“ added Prevost</p>
<p>One of Hudgens’ most popular roles is undoubtedly Gabriella Montez from the High School Musical series. However, since her appearance there, she participated in a number of other motion pictures such as “Bad Boys for Life,” “Spring Breakers,” as well as “Tick, Tick… Boom!” Hudgens also starred in live productions including FOX’s “Grease: Live” and “Rent: Live,” as well as the Broadway musical “Gigi.”</p>
<p>But besides being a famous actress, Hudgens is a growing entrepreneur. Together with Oliver Trevena, she co-founded Caliwater, a startup that crafts tasty wellness drinks from a super fruit called prickly pear. Hudgens is also a part of the beauty brand KNOW Beauty, as well as Thomas Ashbourne Craft Spirits, a famous cocktail brand.</p>
<p>The Company’s Portfolio of Ambassadors Continues to Grow</p>
<p>The recent deal with Hudgens further expands BetMGM’s partnerships with celebrities and famous athletes. Earlier this month, the company announced a collaboration with the famous actor Jerry Ferrara. As a result, the star of movies such as “Eagle Eye,” “Battleship” and “Lone Survivor” became a brand ambassador for BetMGM.</p>
<p>Before that, in August, the company joined forces with Connor McDavid, the youngest team captain in NHL history. The collaboration saw McDavid join forces with BetMGM as a brand ambassador which made him the first active player a part of a major US professional league to team up with a North American sportsbook.</p>
