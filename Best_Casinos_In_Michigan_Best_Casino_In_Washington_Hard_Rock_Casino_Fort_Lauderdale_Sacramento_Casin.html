<p>Scientific Games will launch a number of its gaming and lottery offerings on the Morrocan market through SISAL SPA and in return will help the company develop its local national lottery network.</p>
<p>Entering the Morrocan Market</p>
<p>On 14 November, global gaming and lottery leader Scientific Games announced a new partnership deal with Italian gambling group SISAL SPA. Through the agreement, Scientific Games will supply and launch a number of online gambling services on SISAL SPA’s Morrocan subsidiary. The process is set to begin this month.</p>
<p>Scientific Games plans on integrating its flagship Open Gaming System in SISAL’s own platform. This would then allow for the quick and easy launch of e-instant games and lottery instant games. Furthermore, the company will aid SISAL in further developing its Morrocan national lottery network by supplying cutting-edge WAVE retailer terminals.</p>
<p>Scientific Games has inked a number of other important partnerships recently, including a new five-year contract with Mass Lottery and an interesting data deal with Genius Sports.</p>
<p>However, this partnership with SISAL is of particular importance as it opens a door to the blooming African lottery market. The African gambling, lottery and gaming markets are experiencing healthy growth, which has naturally peaked international interest. A number of companies are already positioning themselves across the African market, including OatBet, BetGames.TV, Playson and many more.</p>
<p>Mutual Trust</p>
<p>Scientific Games Lottery Group Chief Executive Pat McHugh is confident that the deal would be beneficial for both parties. He thanked SISAL for their continued trust in Scientific Games’ abilities to deliver added-value products and services that help maximize sales and earnings for a number of international lottery operations.</p>
<p>Mr. McHugh noted that the company was particularly excited to launch its products on the Morrocan market and help expand SISAL’s local national lottery network.</p>
<p>Morocco’s national lottery is still very young – it launched in January 2019. SISAL games won a 10-year concession to operate the lottery back in 2018, backed by Scientific Games.</p>
<p>SISAL has a number of other current licenses and concessions across the Mediterrainean. SISAL Managing Director of Lottery and International Business Marco Caccavale spoke briefly about the company’s international engagement. Currently, SISAL holds a concession to operate parimutuel games in its home market of Italy and recently won its joint bid to operate Turkey’s national lottery alongside affiliate business and local giant Demirören Holding.</p>
<p>Mr. Caccavale lauded the partnership and healthy cooperation between SISAL and Scientific Games. “The extent of the collaboration we have with Scientific Games in Morocco, Italy and Turkey is clear evidence of the strength of our strategic partnership,” Mr. Caccavale said.</p>
