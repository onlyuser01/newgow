<p>The Monday Night Football game of Week 12 brings us a clash between two NFC North rivals – the Minnesota Vikings (6-5) are welcoming the Chicago Bears (3-8) at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis</p>
<p>Two NFC North rivals have already met in Week 12. On Thanksgiving, the Green Bay Packers beat the Detroit Lions, getting to a 5-6 record and keeping their rivals at 8-3. What this means is that the 6-5 Vikings still have a good chance to challenge for the No. 1 spot in the division.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Bears, with a 3-8 record so far in the 2023 NFL, their only hope is to get a wild card entry to the postseason. But for that, they need to win most of the games in the remainder of the regular season.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings Week 12 Odds</p>

<p>Is It All Over (Already) for the Chicago Bears?</p>
<p>The Bears have only three wins, along with eight losses, which makes them one of the four worst teams in the National Football Conference.</p>
<p>Although there’s a theoretical chance that they could get to a record that would grant them a wild card entry to the 2023 Playoffs, such a scenario doesn’t seem very probable. The thing is that their roster just doesn’t seem good enough to pull it off.</p>
<p>Sure, the Bears did put on a good fight in practically every game of the season, but they just couldn’t do much against better teams. The evidence of this is that their three wins happened against opponents that aren’t projected to make the playoffs – the Carolina Panthers, Las Vegas Raiders, and Washington Commanders.</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings Determined to Win the Week 12 MNF Game</p>
<p>The Vikings lost 21-20 to the Broncos last weekend in Denver, which ended their superb fun of five straight wins. They feel bad for not being able to score at least a field goal in the final drive of the game, but they mustn’t let it get to them.</p>
<p>The Vikings will forget all about the loss if they get back to their winning ways on Monday. Getting a win on Monday night would get them closer to the Lions who are topping the NFC North table.</p>
<p>They’ve got a relatively easy schedule ahead, with the two games with the Lions being their toughest in the remainder of the regular season. They also have to play against the Green Bay Packers at home, as well as against the Las Vegas Raiders and the Cincinnati Bengals on the road.</p>
<p>All of those games seem winnable, even the one against the Bengals who are now without Joe Burrow. Still, arguably their easier game in the remainder of the 2023 season is the one scheduled for this coming Monday.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>The Vikings will win this with no major problems, that’s our prediction for the MNF game. They’re the better team, not to mention that they’ve got motivation, confidence, and even the support from the crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium.</p>
<p>Pick: Minnesota Vikings -3.0 (+100)</p>
