<p>DAZN Group, a global sports entertainment company, unveiled the launch of DAZN 1 HD in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The programming will be available on channel 429 on Sky, DAZN announced. The launch comes just in time for the highly-anticipated return of Anthony Joshua.</p>
<p>Prior to the legend’s return, DAZN 1 HD will shower fans with exciting content, allowing them to catch up with the latest developments in UK boxing. The channel’s 24/7 schedule includes many fan-favorite matches and will engage fans with some of the best moments in boxing. UK fans will also get to enjoy content from a rich variety of MMA and other combat sports leagues.</p>
<p>The programming will also include DAZN’s “trailblazing tie-up” with KSI’s Misfits Boxing – the X Series. The boxing crossover features some of the most influential names in entertainment, sport and lifestyle headlining major fight nights.</p>
<p>In addition to combat sports, DAZN 1 HD will provide customers with broadcasts from women’s soccer leagues. Furthermore, DAZN’s audience will be able to enjoy many emerging sports, including Streetleague Skateboarding, esports and extreme sports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the DAZN app will continue to provide fans with on-demand content and exclusive DAZN Bet offers.</p>
<p>DAZN Wants to Make Sports Accessible and Engaging</p>
<p>Shay Segev, DAZN Group’s chief executive officer, commented on the launch of DAZN 1 HD. He said that distributing DAZN is very important to his team, which is committed to delivering content to more and more fans.</p>
<p>We have ambitious, long-term and strategic plans for the UK market. The more people get to know Dazn and what we offer, not just in terms of rights but the full range of digital, interactive and sports entertainment we are developing, the better. Shay Segev, CEO, DAZN Group</p>
<p>Segev added that the launch will optimize the company’s exposure before Joshua’s return and will make the upcoming bout as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Joshua, who is a shareholder, special advisor and brand ambassador for DAZN, also commented on the agreement. He praised DAZN for its hard work to usher in a new age of sports broadcasting. He noted that the launch of DAZN 1 HD will make it easier for fans to see his new match.</p>
<p>It’s a huge element of why I wanted to commit my long-term future to the platform. The launch of DAZN 1 HD on channel 429 will make it even easier for fans to access my return to the ring on Saturday 1 April against Jermaine Franklin. Make sure you tune in for a spectacular night of boxing. Anthony Joshua, professional boxer and ambassador for DAZN</p>
<p>Sports fans can now sign up and subscribe to DAZN HD 1. The programming begins on March 23, allowing fans to warm up before Joshua’s game.</p>
