<p>NBC Sports has extended its partnership with Boom Sports for the free-to-play sports gaming app that allows sports fans to bet without risk and win real money prizes.</p>
<p>Boom Sports to Continue Powering NBC Sports Predictor Games</p>
<p>Boom Sports will continue to work with NBC Sports as the official supplier for the media company’s free-to-play games and contests. Thanks to this renewal of the companies’ collaboration, NBC Sports Predictor will continue to chug along happily powered by Boom Sports’ tailored products.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sports gaming app will be readily available to NBC consumers and Boom plans on expanding the available products listed on the solution. To make the offer even better, NBC Sports Predictor will start to benefit from PointsBet odds feed giving consumers a more realistic sports wagering experience, a worthwhile addition guaranteed by the existing partnership between NBC Sports and the sportsbook.</p>
<p>To mark the beginning of this new chapter in their mutual operations, Boom is launching a new basketball predictor game, which will arrive this quarter. Originally, NBC Sports Predictor launched in 2018 to cover Premier League with the namesake Pick ‘Em game. It has later expanded to Golf and NASCAR Pick ‘Em games as well as the Sunday Night 7 Football initiative.</p>
<p>Real Money Prizes for Simulated Betting</p>
<p>The Success of some of these products has been undeniable with Premier League Pick ‘Em still going on. Golf Pick ‘Em will also be around for consumers to benefit from and it will restart once the Waste Management Phoenix Open gets underway in February.</p>
<p>Gauging the success of the app, NBC Sports is happy with the results. It has been downloaded 1.5 million times and it has dished out $3 million in cash prizes to fans. Obviously, this is not quite the same amount generated by fully-fledged sports betting products, but this is beyond the point.</p>
<p>NBC Sports is looking for new ways to engage with younger audiences and adding a free-to-play sports betting game, integrated with traditional sports solutions such as PointsBet’s feed, is a great way to do just that.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, NBC Sports Group Enterprises, Betting &amp; Gaming SVP Nicolina O’Rorke had this to say: “We’re excited to renew this partnership with Boom and continue to build upon the success we’ve had together.”</p>
<p>The partnership, O’Rorke said, would be a stepping stone to introduce more gaming and betting opportunities to fans. For his part, Boom Sports CEO and co-founder Steve Murphy said that he was excited to continue collaborating with NBC Sports and bring the company a first-class technology that gives fans the best possible experience.</p>
