    <h1>Harrah S Philadelphia Casino Racetrack La Cabana Beach Resort Casino Avantgarde Casino Login Hollywo</h1>

<p>I already give them everything they wanted...most of the documents has been sent twice because it wasn't perfectly done.</p>
<p>in my opinion ,stalling on that paper alone is their last resort....everything they are asking below is the on the bank statement ...i give it to them like 3 times already lolll I mean i swear to god everything is the bank statement...but they don't want to see it and keep repeating that they want this information otherwise ....blablablabla</p>
<p>like i said my bank dont make up bank statements with specifics like they were asking previously to protect their customers.</p>
<p>now they asking for less..like i said again ist already been given</p>
<p>btw i didn't wanted to run away with winnings...i gamble all the times , if the verification was done quickly i most likely re-deposited 1 or 2 times already..i really liked this site but now how can i ever play there again loll no way i cant ..so sad</p>
