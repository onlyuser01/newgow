<p>Sportradar, a leading tech company that focuses on sports data, has teamed up with industry specialist Tally Technology, which is a dedicated platform for activating and engaging with fans, with a particular focus on several major sports leagues. Fed by Sportradar’s powerful data algorithms, Tally Technology expects to achieve better results and elicit a strong response from target audiences, as reported by Sports Industry Group.</p>
<p>Tally and Sportradar have agreed to tap into the latter’s basketball, ice hockey, baseball, and football data, which will then be used to create long-form, data-driven content.</p>
<p>Among the solutions that the companies have thought about are prediction games and other trivia content. Tally Technology itself is also a free-to-play prediction game platform, which means that it strikes home with sports fans who are interested in being closer to the sports action, but who do not necessarily want to bet any of their own money to get there.</p>
<p>Overall, Tally offers a turnkey fan engagement solution that will only get better with Sportradar’s backing, the companies shared. Commenting on this opportunity, Tally Technology CEO Brad Vettese welcomed the opportunity to team up with Sportradar and help drive better fan engagement.</p>
<p>Vettese noted that thanks to this partnership, Tally can help automate high-value destinations for casual and more committed fans. There is a lot for fans to explore on the platform, Vettese continued, speaking of the content- and friend groups- that the platform has to offer.</p>
<p>The executive confirmed that Tally understood how important fan activation is for clients and their marketing ecosystem and said that Tally is perfectly equipped to handle this by providing the best possible value. Tally has already had successes across a number of sports leagues and with many official teams, to wit Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Seattle Seahawks, and so many others.</p>
<p>Tally is pleased to have the opportunity to work with Sportradar and benefit from the company’s unique data sets to help drive Tally’s own efforts in producing tailored and high-value-added content for sports fans.</p>
<p>Sportradar has been busy as well, with the company recently teaming up with the Australian Baseball League and Baseball Australia focusing on broadcasting rights. The tech giant has also remained laser-focused on helping organizations tackle fraud in sports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, free-to-play engagement platforms are becoming increasingly popular in the United States with the country now regulating betting in more than 31 states and many operators seeking ways to engage with previously untapped audiences.</p>
