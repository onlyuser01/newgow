<p>The leading supplier is certain that "no mortals will be able to resist" its tempting Gods Clash promotion</p>
<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative casino games, has unveiled a special Gods Clash promotion. It will leverage Wazdan’s Mystery Drop tool and will see the company supply a prize pool of $160,000 for the occasion. The promotion will run from February 20 to March 5, providing fans with the chance to win extra prizes when playing the provider’s slot games.</p>
<p>Thundering Prize No Mortal Can Resist</p>
<p>The Mystery Drop tool is a part of Wazdan’s entire portfolio of slots and is included in its top-performing mythology-inspired titles such as Power of the Gods: Hades, Power of the Sun: Svarog and Power of the Gods: Medusa.</p>
<p>Partners can enjoy and launch the promotion “seamlessly and quickly,” the release states, promising that Wazdan will handle the entire setup. Operators don’t have to worry about paying out winnings from the promotion as the supplier will make direct payouts from the prize pool into players’ accounts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wazdan has powered its partners with ready-to-use marketing materials, allowing them to advertise the Gods Clash promotion. The new promotion will help operators boost their customer engagement and retention while providing end-users with extra chances to win prizes.</p>
<p>The promotion is already available in casinos, allowing customers to play Wazdan’s mythological games for extra prizes. The supplier described these as “unimaginable riches that no mortal will resist.”</p>
<p>The Company Teased Details about Upcoming Promotions</p>
<p>Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, spoke on the new promotion. He said that this represents a new way for Wazdan to benefit its clients.</p>
<p>The Gods Clash Network Promotion marks another way for Wazdan to give back to its partners, containing our tried and tested promotional tool that increases key performance metrics. Andrzej Hyla, CCO, Wazdan</p>
<p>Hyla is certain that players will be just as excited about the promotion as it will “boost the allure” of their favorite Wazdan games. The CCO concluded that the promotion will “massively ramp up” players’ engagement.</p>
<p>Wazdan used the opportunity to also talk about its plans for the next few months. The company released a Network Promotion roadmap that covers the first half of 2023. Wazdan plans to follow up the Gods Clash promotion with an Easter Drop promotion that will run between April 3 and 16 and will have the same prize pool. Then, from May 15 to August 15, Wazdan will run Breaks the Rules, its biggest promotion yet. The company has prepared a prize pool of over a million dollars for the occasion.</p>
