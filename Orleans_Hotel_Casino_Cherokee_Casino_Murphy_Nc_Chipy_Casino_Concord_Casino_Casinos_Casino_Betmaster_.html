    <h1>Orleans Hotel Casino Cherokee Casino Murphy Nc Chipy Casino Concord Casino Casinos Casino Betmaster</h1>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>It happened that I became a new customer and they say that I accepted the sports betting bonus and it is not true. I put in money to play the casino. I entered money this way:</p>
<p>100chf</p>
<p>100chf</p>
<p>200chf</p>
<p>200chf</p>
<p>In the first 3 entries I lost money and from the fourth entry I started to earn money. When I reached the figure of 6,500chf I realized that my money that previously appeared in real money they had passed it to me as bonus money and I swear to God they never gave me money and I never played any bonus. When I realized that I contacted customer service and they told me that I have an active bonus and to spend my bonus money to real money I have to place sports bets worth 1000chf. Ok ... I thought ... it will be easy because I have 6,500chf. When I have filled the bar, there is only 300chf left to finish, I am blocked from sports bets. I speak with customer service and they tell me that they have blocked my bets because I was betting high limits and they have the right to block and unblock.</p>
<p>Ok I come up with the idea of making low bets to see if I could beat their system that had blocked me because I only had a week to be able to unlock the bonus and spend my money to real money but they had blocked my bets then no I could complete the bonus !!!! Ok ... I'm lucky that the system lets me make 5chf bets so I make 400chf in 5chf bets. While the bets are being completed I keep playing the casino and I get to the figure of 9,500chf. I return to leave the casino and wait for the bonus to complete. What happened in the end??? That the bonus was completed but they only gave me 500chf arguing that under the conditions of the bonus they can only pay the maximum amount of 5 times the bonus. They are supposed to give me 100chf so they can pay me a maximum of 500chf. I had 9,500chf so they stole 9,000chf from my face. I don't know if these abusive bonus rules are legal, but the most important thing of all is that I WAS NOT GIVEN ANY BONUSES. I always played with my money and every time I entered money I put real money. I have spoken with them and asked for explanations and I ONLY want them to show me when they gave me the bonus because it does not appear in my betting or transaction system. They tell me that in their asstema it appears but IT IS A LIE because once a person there told me an hour and a minute and another worker told me another so they are lying to me. I have asked them please to make me a screenshot of what they see but they tell me that it is forbidden to send a screenshot. I'm really going to report them. They have stolen 9,000chf from me.</p>
