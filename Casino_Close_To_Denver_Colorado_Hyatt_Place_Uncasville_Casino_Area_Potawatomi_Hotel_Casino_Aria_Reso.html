<p>Serving as a board member since 2018, Forestell possesses extensive industry knowledge and will be instrumental in aiding the organization’s regulatory efforts</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) has announced that Dave Forestell will become the new Chair of its Board of Directors. Forestell’s appointment comes as no surprise, given his past contributions to the organization and deep understanding of the online gambling sector. His diverse professional background will give AGCO a fresh perspective, helping the regulator remain in touch with the latest industry developments.</p>
<p>The New Chair Has a History of Success</p>
<p>Forestell’s two decades of professional experience encompassing leadership positions in the government and private sectors were instrumental for his unique outlook on the gambling industry’s prospects and regulatory challenges. The new Chair served as VP of Scotiabank and worked as acting executive director at the Conservative Party of Canada. Forestell most recently was VP of Canada External Relations at TC Energy.</p>
<p>He has been an active member of the AGCO board for several years, demonstrating a deep understanding of the industry and a commitment to upholding regulatory standards. Forestell also held the position of Chair for iGaming Toronto, a subsidiary of AGCO responsible for overseeing the province’s growing online gaming sector. His input was instrumental in shaping the province’s digital gaming landscape while ensuring player protection and responsible gambling practices.</p>
<p>With his new appointment as Chair of AGCO’s Board of Directors, Forestell has decided to commit his full efforts to this critical role. As a result, he will step down from his position as Chair at iGaming Toronto to focus on the broader responsibilities and challenges associated with overseeing the entire alcohol and gaming industry in Ontario.</p>
<p>The AGCO Retains Its Vital Functions</p>
<p>Forestell’s appointment happens during a critical time for the regulator as current registrar and chief executive Tom Mungham announced he would retire this fall. One of the new Chair’s first responsibilities will be to help steer the regulator during the transitional period, ensuring smooth operation and adherence to the organization’s underlying principles.</p>
<p>The AGCO plays a crucial role in overseeing the province’s alcohol and gaming sectors, ensuring compliance with regulations, and fostering a safe and secure environment for consumers and operators. The continuous evolution of the gambling industry poses constant new challenges requiring proactive and forward-thinking leadership. Forestell’s diverse experience could prove invaluable in accommodating technological advancements and developing industry trends.</p>
<p>As the gaming landscape in Ontario continues to evolve, the AGCO’s role becomes increasingly critical in ensuring a safe and secure gaming environment for all. Dave Forestell’s addition to the leadership team aids the commission’s mission to navigate the industry’s complexities, protect consumers and promote responsible gambling practices.</p>
