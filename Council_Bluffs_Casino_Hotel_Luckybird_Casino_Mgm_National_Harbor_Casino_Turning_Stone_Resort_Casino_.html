<p>Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, it’s quite usual for withdrawals to take a couple of days or even weeks to get fully processed. This means that it may take some time before your money appears in your account, especially if it’s your first withdrawal or you’re withdrawing a bigger amount of money.</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to receive your winnings, you will go through KYC verification (know your customer, alternatively known as know your client or KYC, is the process whereby a business verifies the identity of its clients and assesses their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship. The term can also refer to the bank regulations and anti-money laundering regulations that govern these activities.) Please understand, that without verifying your account, you won’t be able to receive any winnings. This is a standard procedure in a vast majority of casinos. Thank you very much for your understanding and patience.</p>
