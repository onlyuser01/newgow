    <h1>Cannery Casino Hotel Casinos Resorts Las Vegas Best Casino Casino In Wheeling Wv Montreal Casino Whi</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal of 500 euros coming from a cash back bonus of 50 euros, according to their contract it is expected that I can withdraw only 50x10 or 500 euros, just like I did. I had won 1200 euros but 700 euros cut them (burnt that no one can use and they took them back). but 500 are mine. however, they accepted the documents on January 26, 2020 to date 8 days have passed, and the pending withdrawal does not always happen. when I contact by chat the operators tell me that I have to keep depositing if I want the times to get shorter. But is this normal (make a similar request?).</p>
<p>The casino in question is "The white lion bets". thanks and many greetings, I will be grateful if you can help me, I would like to avoid writing in Curacao., I would like to solve it (because it is only 500 euros).</p>
<p>I had to tick another casino because white lion bets wasn't on the list</p>
