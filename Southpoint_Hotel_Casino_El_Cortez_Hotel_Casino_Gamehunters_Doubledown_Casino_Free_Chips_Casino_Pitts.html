<p>Independent gambling harm-prevention consultancy EPIC Risk Management is moving in a proactive way to expand its presence in the US as sports betting in North America is booming.</p>
<p>In Line with EPIC’s Broader Strategy</p>
<p>Having affirmed its presence in Europe and the UK, the gambling harm minimization firm is setting up a subsidiary in the state of Delaware to address gambling harm-prevention needs on US and Canadian territories.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management’s US subsidiary, headquartered in Delaware and operating as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), will look to emphasize that the commitment to reducing gambling harm is a commercially sustainable business as much as a socially driven one.</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management founder and CEO Paul Buck underscored the setting up of the subsidiary as a PBC was in line with the company’s broader global strategy to minimize gambling-related harm and marked a key moment in EPIC’s work in the US.</p>
<p>“The US betting and gambling landscape is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth, due in no small part to the legalization of sports betting across many states. It is vitally important that gambling harm is recognized and treated as a public health issue that all stakeholders have a duty to mitigate from politicians to the gambling industry operators, to sports teams and leagues, plus the media and regulators.” Paul Buck, Founder and CEO, EPIC Risk Management</p>
<p>With strong evidence of EPIC’s industry-leading education and awareness provisions related to gambling harm across 23 countries globally and well-established foothold in Europe and the UK, the US subsidiary of the consultancy will continue to impact public health in a positive direction by providing education, advocacy, and expert advice, as well as resources to people at risk of developing problem gambling and experiencing gambling harm.</p>
<p>“We believe that today’s announcement signifies a period of exciting growth for our organization and will play an important role in further developing EPIC’s services in the US to prevent harm.” Paul Buck, Founder and CEO, EPIC Risk Management</p>
<p>Raising Gambling Harm Awareness Initiatives</p>
<p>Present in the US since 2019, EPIC Risk Management launched several initiatives aimed at raising gambling harm awareness in collaboration with the NFLPA Professional Athletes Foundation, a number of college athletic programs, and the Division on Addiction at Cambridge Health Alliance.</p>
<p>In June, EPIC appointed leading expert on video game addiction Cam Adair as its iGaming and esports consultant to beef up efforts to prevent harm caused by gambling on esports in Europe and the US.</p>
<p>Adair was the second high-profile addition to the gambling harm minimization consultancy, following in the footsteps of coach and mentor Michael V. Huber, who was appointed as an advisor ahead of the Problem Gambling Awareness Month to share his personal experience with gambling addiction and recovery.</p>
