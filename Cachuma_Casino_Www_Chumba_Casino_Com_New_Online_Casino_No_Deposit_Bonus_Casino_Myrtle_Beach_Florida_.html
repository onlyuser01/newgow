<p>NetEnt’s inventive InfiniReels concept imbues Red Tiger’s popular slot game Dragon’s Fire to create an exciting new fantasy-themed slot game.</p>
<p>Beloved Dragon’s Fire Slot Game Reworked with InfiniReels</p>
<p>Evolution-owned casino game and software provider Red Tiger is introducing a new game with infinite possibilities, following strong annual results for the company. Dragon’s Fire: InfiniReels is an adapted new version of the beloved Dragon’s Fire game featuring the limitless reels mechanic.</p>
<p>The slot with 3 rows and 3 reels is in a mythical dragon’s lair setting where each win grants players a new reel on the right side of the locked reels for the following spin, multiplying the bet ways by three with each additional extra reel on the screen.</p>
<p>An additional feature called Fire Egg is activated when a Scatter symbol shows a multiplier applied to all wins. The slot will show only one egg per spin, and additional eggs will tot up the multiplier amount if one egg is already in play. The multiplier resets when the reels return to their original size.</p>
<p>Another feature known as the Fire Wilds enables a maximum of 2 reels to ignite mid-spin, which calls on wilds substitutes to take the place of any pay symbols. Following a win, Fire Wilds can appear on only new reels.</p>
<p>When 3 Dragon Spins appear on the original three reels, 10 Free Dragon Spins are awarded. Once set off, one pay symbol is selected at random, and this symbol, along with Fire Eggs, Fire Wilds, and +2 Spin symbols, are the only ones that land during Dragon Spins, where the +2 Spin symbols grant two extra free spins to the round.</p>
<p>The Release Follows Other Successful Collaboration Titles Such as Piggy Riches Megaways</p>
<p>The partnership between the two companies is their third joint effort after the success of Piggy Riches Megaways and Gonzo’s Quest Megaways.</p>
<p>Chief Product Officer of Evolution, Todd Haushalter, commented that Dragon’s Fire: InfiniReels is a big step for both NetEnt and Red Tiger. According to Haushalter, the new slot game is the perfect way to demonstrate the potential of NetEnt’s infinite reels concept.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to players sampling the thrill of InfiniReels in this new adaptation perfectly crafted to fit the Dragon’s Fire series gameplay features that slots players already know and love,” Haushalter said.</p>
<p>Red Tiger and NetEnt have collaborated on other projects just as well. The companies joined FashionTV to add glitz and glamor to the slot experience with a namesake slot game. Red Tiger also struck a partnership with Rush Street Interactive (RSI) to bring gaming products last year.</p>
