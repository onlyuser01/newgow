<p>Inspired Entertainment is moving in to close the year with another high-profile appointment in the face of Marilyn Jentzen who is stepping in as the interim Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer for the company. Her appointment comes at a time when inspired wants to move into 2024 on a solid footing as the former incumbent, Stewart Baker, left the company on December 20.</p>
<p>This has mandated quick response from the company which is keen to ensure that its financial operations continue uninterrupted in the custody of a skilled and seasoned industry veteran, which is precisely where Jentzen comes in.</p>
<p>She is an experienced veteran who has significant experience in financial and accounting operations and comes from a similar position at Innovative Impact Consulting, which she founded and served as the CEO of.</p>
<p>Jentzen has an extensive career working as a financial advisor and she has been providing support and services to medium and large companies in search of accomplished financial professionals.</p>
<p>Her appointment to Inspired Entertainment comes after a career of holding similar stints, including as VP, Strategy, Global Operations Centers at Thomson Reuters and Senior VP, France at IGT. Jentzen’s track record is appreciated by her new home at Inspired, although she has not been confirmed as a permanent hire in the position, which may come at a later point.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ian Freeman was picked as Chief Commercial Officer for Inspired, with the man stepping into the position at a time of heightened commercial activity for the company caught in rapid expansion.</p>
<p>To celebrate the holiday season, Inspired Entertainment similarly embarked on a trifecta of slot releases, featuring Catch Of The Christmas Day Respin ‘Em In, Santa’s Winter Wilds and Cops ‘n’ Robbers Big Money Christmas.</p>
