<p>EEG and Philadelphia Eagles Team up for Esports Tournaments</p>
<p>Esports Entertainment Group is entering a multi-year partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles, an NFL franchise. As a result, EEG is the first organization to officially team up with a football team to specifically provide the franchise with a dedicated esports tournament.</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, the Eagles will join EEG as a shareholder.

<p>Carlson commended EEG on its leadership position in esports entertainment and expressed confidence that its ability to bring fans together will transcend physical and digital borders for a unified experience for all, adding:</p>

<p>Building a Loyal Fan Base and Following across Multiple Verticals</p>
<p>EEG will tap into Philadelphia Eagles IP and assets and leverage them across local markets. There will be custom videos featuring the team’s players as well as special campaigns to promote the tournaments.

<p>EEG CEO Grant Johnson has praised the partnership, arguing that the entire organization was thrilled to welcome the Eagles into the esports family. EEG is now looking forward to expand its reach with dedicated fan bases and drive growth for the franchise.</p>
