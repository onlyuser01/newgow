<p>James Dolan in Talks to Bring Beyonce for Vegas Sphere</p>

<p>James Dolan wants one single lady as the next headliner for his Las Vegas Sphere, the New York Post reports. But the CEO of Sphere Entertainment may need to put a $10M ring on it if he wants Queen Bey to perform in Sin City.</p>

<p>Dolan is currently in talks with the pop superstar’s team about taking up where U2 lets off next year. Beyonce’s manager-mother, Tina Knowles, and her husband, Jay-Z, have already taken separate tours of the global venue behind the Venetian, according to unnamed sources quoted in The Post.</p>
<p>Beyonce’s team is reportedly asking for $10M to produce the high-tech video required for a Sphere residency. That’s the same size check U2 was cut.</p>
<p>While Queen Bey might land the $10M production fee, Dolan won’t also want to turn over 90% of ticket sales to her. That’s the unheard-of deal U2 reportedly cut for being Dolan’s $2.3 billion venue’s guinea pigs, which came in over $1 billion over budget.</p>
<p>This is especially true after Sphere Entertainment lost $98.4M for the quarter ending September 30, a day after its chief financial officer quit following a chewing out by Dolan.</p>
<p>U2 opened the 18,600-seat Sphere on September 29 and concluded its 36-date “U2:UV Achtung Baby” residency on February 18. No other Sphere concerts are scheduled after that.</p>
<p>The Sphere’s stock price was down slightly on Wednesday, trading at around $36.</p>
<p>Big Names, Big Appeal</p>
<p>During a November 8 earnings call, Dolan told analysts he expects to host two residencies in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>“We’re having conversations with artists across a wide variety of genres, including discussing runs of varying lengths,” he said.</p>
<p>The Post reported that Dolan has also been discussing future residencies with Paul McCartney, Bon Jovi, and Lady Gaga, who guested on one of U2’s Sphere shows last month. The Post also reported in August that the Eagles had already “locked in dates” at the Sphere, though nothing further came of that.</p>
<p>Beyonce would bring a more Millennial vibe to the Sphere than the Gen-Xers attracted by U2. She’s also a bigger draw than U2. Tickets for her “Renaissance World Tour” this past summer were in high demand; even “obstructed view” seats sold for hundreds of dollars</p>
<p>Beyonce wrapped her “Renaissance World Tour” on October 1 and has no shows scheduled for next year.</p>
