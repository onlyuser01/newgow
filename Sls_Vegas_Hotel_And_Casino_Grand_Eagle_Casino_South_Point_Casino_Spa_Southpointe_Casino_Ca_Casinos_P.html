<p>Push Gaming, a B2B gaming provider, has reached an agreement with United Remote. Push Gaming’s iconic games, such as Land of Zenith, Wheel of Wonders, and Jammin’ Jars, will now be available to players on sites like Lapalingo, signaling a bigger step into Germany’s upcoming controlled online market.</p>
<p>Push Gaming Reached an Agreement with United Remote</p>
<p>The collaboration will act as a storefront for the highly awaited Push games Dinopolis and Jammin’ Jars 2, which will be released in the coming months.</p>
<p>The gaming industry benefits from United Remote’s new, creative infrastructure, which includes a variety of marketing platforms such as Cooladata, Simplify, and The Hub.</p>
<p>Head of sales at Push Gaming, Fiona Hickey, made a comment on the latest partnership by stating: “The market in Germany has long been promised and holds much potential, so it was vital for us to make sure our content is in the right hands.”</p>
<p>Hickey continued her statement by saying that Push Gaming is optimistic that United Remote would provide the business with the ideal platform, allowing them to sell their high-quality games to their preferred white label partners. This presents a great chance for the business to expand and solidify its already powerful presence in this new jurisdiction.</p>
<p>CEO at United Remote, Tal Zamstein, also made a comment saying that United will ensure that all of the company’s goods are of the utmost quality by thoroughly testing them to ensure that they meet the needs of both players and operators.</p>
<p>In his words, Push Gaming has the same enthusiasm for providing the best possible opportunities as United Remote does while collaborating with their B2B partners. United is honored to make their content open to United’s customers on the company’s website.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s String of Partnerships</p>
<p>Push Gaming has been building its list of partnerships over the last half a year. In Q4 2020, the company struck a partnership with Genesis Global, followed by one with EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine platform in November.</p>
<p>Ever since Push became a content supplier, EveryMatrix clients have had direct access to Push Gaming’s critically-acclaimed titles, new releases, and casino classics.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s products are featured at some of the best iGaming operators around the world, including but not limited to Casumo, William Hill, LeoVegas, and others, giving the content supplier a strong foothold in Europe and emerging markets, not least of which Germany.</p>
