<p>Race track and casino operator Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) issued in a press release July 29 that it would launch its sports betting operations in Michigan in partnership with Hannahville Indian Community.</p>
<p>Retail BetAmerica Sports Book</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement reached with the Hannahville Indian tribe, CDI will open a BetAmerica-branded retail sports book at the Island Resort &amp; Casino in Harris, operated by the tribe, and will launch its BetAmerica online platform, together with its online casino throughout the Wolverine State, subject to acquiring necessary license and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The Hannahville Indian Community is a relatively small tribe located at the heart of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, which fate has changed entirely since the introduction of gaming in the 1980’s.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited about our new partnership with BetAmerica. The BetAmerica sportsbook will expand upon our already compelling number of entertainment options, and provides another great reason for people to come and visit us up here on Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula.” Kenneth Meshigaud, Tribal Chairperson, Hannahville Indian Community</p>
<p>The Great Lakes State expands the presence of CDI’s BetAmerica sports book brand into a fifth state, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Mississippi. Michigan’s regulator, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), started accepting applications for online gambling licenses since May hoping to be able to officially launch online sports betting in early 2021.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be able to offer sports fans throughout Michigan our innovative BetAmerica sportsbook and iGaming product. Guests of Island Resort &amp; Casino as well as online players in the Michigan will be able to access sports betting, the best in online casino games and unique promotions through BetAmerica.” Bill Mudd, COO, Churchill Downs Incorporated</p>
<p>Besides BetAmerica, the mobile sports betting space in Michigan will feature gaming and sports book providers such as DraftKings, as the Boston-based fantasy sport and betting operator gained entry through a partnership deal with Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino to bring its mobile sports book app in the state. The presence of high-caliber mobile sports book operators in Michigan will provide a competitive sports betting environment for CDI.</p>
<p>Parallel with the announcement for the launch of mobile sports book operations in Michigan, CDI posted its second quarter financial results. The company revealed its Q2 net revenue sank to $185.1 million, down 61% compared to the same period in 2019, contributing to a net loss of $118.8 million for the quarter, as opposed to a net profit of $107.1 million for Q1 2020.</p>
