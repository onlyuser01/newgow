    <h1>Casino Bingo Schedule The Luxor Hotel And Casino Choctaw Casino Hotel Durant Harrah S Cherokee Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Markalc,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>Please understand that KYC is a very important and essential process, during which the casino makes sure that the money is sent to the rightful owner. As they don't have the luxury of being able to physically see all of the players and check their identification and documents, this is the only way gambling establishments are able to complete the verification procedures. None of the serious and licensed casinos takes KYC lightly and it might take a few working days to complete this thorough process.</p>
<p>Could you advise which documents exactly you submitted originally and which documents were requested from you again in the email? When exactly did you submit the last document required for verification?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
