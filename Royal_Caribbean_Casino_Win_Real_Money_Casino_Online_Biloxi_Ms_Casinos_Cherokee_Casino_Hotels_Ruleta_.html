    <h1>Royal Caribbean Casino Win Real Money Casino Online Biloxi Ms Casinos Cherokee Casino Hotels Ruleta</h1>

<p>The 2012-founded iGaming technology company that offers leading solutions, products, and services to iGaming Operators Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has designated Marcel Elfersy as its new chief commercial officer for platform and sportsbook. The appointment comes naturally following the group’s plans to strengthen its foothold as a leading tier 1 platform provider of sportsbook services in regulated markets worldwide.</p>
<p>GiG Ready to Enter the New Year With Real Excitement</p>
<p>The company that strives to become the industry leader in platforms and media content while driving sustainable growth and profitability has made the new appointment to further expand the group’s technology reach. To achieve these goals, Elfersy will work closely with GiG’s sales and commercial team while going after the exciting opportunities provided by regulated global markets.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new appointment, the group’s chief executive officer Richard Brown referred to Elfersy’s high caliber and experience as assets that will help them take a “significant step forward” in leveraging their full potential. Brown also mentioned the company’s ongoing interest in improving its work as one of its main operating principles, while mentioning the strong foothold of the business in “diverse and high-value areas” of the Business-to-Business supply chain part of the sports betting and iGaming industry. Accordingly, the group is looking forward to entering the new year “with real excitement.”</p>
<p>Elfersy, “Super-Excited” to Join GiG</p>
<p>Speaking about his appointment, Elfersy expressed his super-excitement to be joining Richard together with the “all-star-team” at GiG. The new CCO also said that he was “really impressed” by the group’s strategic growth as a premium Business-to-Business provider in the past few years, while praising their market agility and “unrivaled regulated omnichannel portfolio,” along with their completion of proven services and products.</p>
<p>Prior to being appointed the Gig’s new CCO, Elfersy spent six months as OXTech Group’s chief executive, one year as Impala Digital’s CEO, and more than 12 years as 888’s business development manager, business development director, and vice president of business development. His impressive resume also includes a position as chief executive officer for Entain’s Africa JV, Business-to-Business. From his position as vice president of business development at 888, he helped the company re-enter the regulated iGaming market in the US while helping them expand their Business-to-Business operations, supervising the Delaware Lottery agreement and the acquisition of the Betbright sportsbook.</p>
<p>Elfersy was also Come2Play’s board member for two years and he spent time working in a number of important positions for T-Mobile UK, JPMorgan Chase, CenturyLink, as well as the US Department of Commerce and the US Defence Logistics Agency. At the beginning of December, GiG inked a partnership with News Corp UK &amp; Ireland, bringing its sports betting and casino content to News Corp’s The Sun and talkSPORT platforms. During the same month, GiG also announced it would power Starcasino’s debut into the Spanish iGaming market.</p>
