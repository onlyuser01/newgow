<p>More shocking revelations have come out regarding dubious transactions at Crown Resorts’ casino Crown Melbourne, which may lead to another fine of AUD 100 million ($68.3 million). Following discoveries regarding the use of blank cheques in exchange for casino chips, on September 1, the Victorian Gambling Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) requested Crown Resorts to provide all available information on the matter.</p>
<p>Crown Melbourne Faces One More Record Fine</p>
<p>The troubles of the Crown Melbourne are not over yet. After being slapped with a record fine of AUD 80 million ($54.7 million) in June in connection with the scheme with China UnionPay transactions, the scandal-ridden casino is up for another significant fine.</p>
<p>This time Crown Resorts will probably have to dig their pockets deeper and pay up AUD 100 million ($68.3 million).</p>
<p>The ongoing probe by the Royal Commission into the Melbourne casino’s operations has revealed more activities that violate the Casino Control Act. It turns out that the casino allowed its guests to change blank cheques for gambling chips.</p>
<p>The VGCCC has highlighted that the restrictions on the transactions between the casino and its guests are in place in order to protect the players from gambling more funds than they actually have. Additionally, they protect the industry from criminal infiltration and abuse.</p>
<p>The new revelations will not only lead to a significant fine but could also result in a restriction of the casino’s license and new recommendations for reforms in The Crown Melbourne.</p>
<p>Crown Commits to Fully Collaborate with the VGCCC</p>
<p>Crown Resorts has made a commitment to fully cooperate with the VGCCC on any matters that emerge as a result of the Victorian Royal Commission Report.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company has pointed out that Crown Resorts has made significant changes and reforms to its business as a response to the VGCCC’s and other government recommendations.</p>
<p>Crown Melbourne in particular has proven its commitment to comply with all regulations and to achieve a safe and responsible gaming experience for all its patrons with the positive progress it has made during the past two years following the path to compliance mapped out by the VGCCC.</p>
<p>Australia’s Troubled Casino Industry</p>
<p>Crown Melbourne is not the only casino in Australia that has seriously violated gambling regulations. Investigations into the operations of numerous Australian casinos have been ongoing in the last couple of years. These include The Star Sydney, The Star Gold Coast, The Crown Perth, The Crown Sydney, and most recently The Ville casino in Townsville and The Reef Hotel Casino in Cairns with most of the casinos having been involved in schemes with China UnionPay cards or other dubious junket interactions.</p>
