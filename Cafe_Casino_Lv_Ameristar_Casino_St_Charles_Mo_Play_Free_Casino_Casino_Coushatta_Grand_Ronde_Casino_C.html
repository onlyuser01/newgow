<p>The company praised the appointee’s deep understanding of trading and said that he is perfectly suited for the job</p>
<p>A few weeks after naming Owen Parry head of customer engagement, ComeOn Group designated Nicholas Jones as its new head of trading. The new appointee is an industry veteran whose experience in trading will be instrumental in scaling ComeOn Group up.</p>
<p>Jones will join the leading iGaming operator, bringing 30 years of trading experience to the team. Prior to his position as ComeOn’s head of trading, Jones served a variety of other operators, including Openbet, GVC/Bwin, Superbet and Stanleybet.</p>
<p>His trading savvy and iGaming industry experience made him a perfect fit for ComeOn Group, which is currently pursuing further growth. In his new role, the appointee will be responsible for defining and implementing the company’s trading and risk strategy for its new proprietary sportsbook platform.</p>
<p>Jones’ help will be very important to the company because of its desire to accelerate the growth of its sports betting business.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ComeOn Group also added Sherwin Jarvand as its new chief data officer, strengthening its team with another talented employee.</p>
<p>Jones Is the Right Person for the Job</p>
<p>ComeOn Group’s director of sportsbook, Jonathan West, welcomed the new hire to the company, saying that the team is happy to have him on board.</p>
<p>West explained that the operator is increasingly focused on its in-house sportsbook platform, which is why it sought someone who’s experienced in trading. According to the director, Jones was “certainly that person.”</p>
<p>West praised the appointee’s deep understanding of trading and said that he is perfectly suited to define and execute the company’s risk strategy, as well as complement its team across all of its locations.</p>
<p>As we accelerate our investment in our sportsbook strategy and in-house platform we know that with Nick on board we are in safe hands as we unlock the biggest growth opportunity within sportsbook for the years to come for us. Jonathan West, director of sportsbook ComeOn Group</p>
<p>Last month, ComeOn Group unveiled a new Nordic-theme lounge, expanding its live casino product line. The studio is called Nordic Ruby Lounge and offers a distinct atmosphere that has been designed to appeal to Nordic fans.</p>
<p>In May, the gambling company also extended its content partnership with Pragmatic Play in the Netherlands. Under the deal, the latter company’s Chroma Blackjack solution went live in the country with ComeOn’s comeon.nl brand.</p>
