<p>Nashville SC vs Atlanta United is the opening game of the 10th round of the 2023 MLS. It’s taking place at Geodis Park in Nashville on Saturday, April 29</p>
<p>Both teams are flying relatively high at the moment, but both would love to have done even better. This goes especially for the hosts who are without a win in four games. The visitors from Georgia, on the other hand, won one of their last three games, but the fact is that their schedule was much more difficult.</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs Atlanta United Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Nashville SC +110 Draw +250 Atlanta United +229</p>

<p>Nashville SC Hoping to Improve Home Record</p>
<p>Nashville SC is 3-3-3 in the 2023 MLS, while its home record is 2-2-1. That’s not too bad, but these guys haven’t won a game on their turf since March 11. They did win one on the road since then. It happened against Orlando City in a game that saw Nashville SC score twice while keeping a clean sheet.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the boys from Nashville have kept a clean sheet in five of the nine MLS games they’ve played this season. In the other four, they conceded a total of five goals. That’s the lowest number of all the teams in the league, which makes Nashville SC the best defensive side in the 2023 MLS.</p>
<p>The most impressive fact is that they did well at the back despite playing against some really tough opponents, including Los Angeles FC, New York City FC, and FC Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Atlanta United’s Ambitions Keep Rising</p>
<p>Atlanta United is 5-3-1 in the 2023 MLS, and with 18 points, the boys from Georgia are sitting in the No. 3 position in the Eastern Conference. They’re just two points behind the New England Revolution and FC Cincinnati, each of which has 20 points.</p>
<p>Atlanta suffered a humiliating 6-1 loss to Columbus Crew in their last game of March. However, the loss had a sobering effect on them – they then went on to win two and draw two games in April.</p>
<p>What’s really impressive about Atlanta’s record this month is that it’s had to face some really nasty rivals. But they still managed to do very well, beating NY Red Bulls and Chicago Fire, and drawing with NYCFC and Toronto FC.</p>
<p>Nashville SC vs Atlanta United Prediction</p>
<p>Nashville SC is great in the defense; Atlanta United’s strongest weapon is the offense. Which one will prevail? We think the latter one. It’s just that Atlanta’s players have been in top shape over the last couple of weeks, putting on some superb performances against opponents that are way tougher than Nashville SC.</p>
<p>Pick: Atlanta United to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
