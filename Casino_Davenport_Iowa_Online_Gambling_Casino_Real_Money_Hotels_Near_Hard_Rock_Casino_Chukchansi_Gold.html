<p>During the Colossal Respin, you muster giant symbols on the grid and have a shot to cover more ground with a winning combination. Next, iSoftBet has the Mystery spins feature which triggers at random.</p>
<p>The highlight of the slot machine is the Hold and Win bonus where six or more Cash Shields will appear to award you three respins. For every shield you land once you have activated the feature, you will reset the spins, extending your free rounds.</p>
<p>Once you have the spins going, you will be able to benefit from the Thunder Shields Boosters. Shields in different colors will start appearing on the reels, and each color will reveal a different multiplier.</p>
<p>The game has three unique additional features, to name Reel Boost, Cash Boost or Respins Boost to extend your gaming session and add to the maximum profit you may squeeze out, should Odin favor you.</p>
<p>ISoftBet already has a good portfolio to be proud of, including not only the Hold and Win family, but also a selection of Megaways slots. As Claxton says, Thunder Shields has the potential to lead to massive wins.</p>
