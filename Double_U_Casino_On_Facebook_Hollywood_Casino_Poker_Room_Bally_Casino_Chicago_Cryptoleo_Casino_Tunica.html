<p>Football Glory review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Football Glory does its best to recreate some of the thrill of watching your favourite teams and players compete for a gold trophy. With its background of a football pitch and atmospheric sounds of cheering crowds, the game puts you in the stands watching the action unfold.</p>
<p>There are four players, each of who represents a different team. They run the gamut from stylish young guns to skinhead head thugs.</p>
<p>Fans of football aren’t short of gambling opportunities, but here’s yet another.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Football Glory is an Yggdrasil Gaming slot, which means two things: gorgeous graphics and clever gameplay. While Yggdrasil might have let the ball slip through their goalie gloves a little on this one, it's not a bad looking slot.</p>
<p>The field in the background sets the scene nicely and the symbols all work well with the theme and style of the slot.</p>
<p>The real masterstroke, though, is the soundtrack. A dull roar of a stadium crowd creates the ambient track, while understated win and spin sounds work together to build the feel of a stadium at capacity.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The basic gameplay is pretty simple. A five reel slot with four rows and 25 win lines making up the main game.</p>
<p>The really interesting parts of the gameplay lie in the bonuses (details below). These combine to make an exciting, well paced game.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Cup symbols and Free Spin symbols.</p>
<p>There are two Cup symbols. In the base game, landing the Silver Cup symbol or a Gold Cup symbol during a spin allows the player to draw one of five prizes. The prizes for the Silver Cup are a payout of a randomised multiple of the player's bet, or free spins.</p>
<p>The Gold Cup also awards a randomised multiple of the player's bet or free spins, but the range of prizes is higher for the Gold Cup than for the Silver. You can also win additional bonus games and features with a Gold Cup.</p>
<p>Landing a Cup symbol during free spins awards players with additional free spins or extra Wilds.</p>
<p>The Free Spin bonus is triggered one of two ways.</p>
<p>The first way is by filling up a footballer’s meter. Each time a footballer symbol is part of a winning combo, that footballer’s meter increases. Filling the meter triggers Superstar Free Spins, in which that footballer’s symbol becomes a sticky Wild whenever one lands.</p>
<p>The second way is to hit three or more Free Spin symbols. The more Free Spin symbols you hit, the more free spins are awarded. During these free spins, the footballer symbols all play as in the base game. None become sticky Wilds. However, some will become regular Wilds at random.</p>
<p>Before Free Spins a wheel is spun which can award additional spins, Superstar Free Spins, sticky Wilds, or a Wild reel.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.10%, right in the range of "roughly 96%" which we consider average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is at the high end of medium, which makes it a reasonable match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We prefer higher volatility where possible, but high-medium isn’t bad.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Football Glory is the ideal slot for any soccer fans who just can’t leave the game behind on the pitch. The graphics are good and the sense of atmosphere excellent.</p>
<p>We would rather a slightly higher volatility and/or a higher RTP, but it’s not a bad match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>We can give this one a light recommendation.</p>
