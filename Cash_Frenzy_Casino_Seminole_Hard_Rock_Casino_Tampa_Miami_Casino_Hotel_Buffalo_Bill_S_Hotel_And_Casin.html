<p>Betsson is sending a clear signal of its further intentions insofar as the company’s expansion plans are concerned with the sports betting and gaming operator strengthening its positions in Latin America. To achieve this, the company has become the Official Regional Partner for AC Milan in the region.</p>
<p>As a result, Betsson will have access to the image, likeness, and full portfolio of intellectual properties owned by the football club. Betsson will gain circumference marketing rights, such as at LED perimeters during live games, but also has its logo featured at AC Milan’s official website and app.</p>
<p>The partners will work on a number of content opportunities as well, including the creation of editorial series that will be shared with fans and will seek to promote each party’s respective offer. Fans in Latin America will use these series to further strengthen their understanding of the club and garner unique insight into the inner workings of AC Milan. To this end, Betsson Group Commercial Director for South America Andrea Rossi said that the company was thrilled to be teaming up with AC Milan as a sign of the company’s long-term commitment to the region.</p>
<p>Rossi described AC Milan as an "innovation-driven club," and then added: "Our shared goal is to offer a more modern and engaging storytelling of sports, creating high-quality entertainment for the Rossoneri fans in South America." He is not the only executive to welcome this opportunity. AC Milan Chief Revenue Officer Casper Stylsvig said that the collaboration with Betsson is a unique opportunity to strengthen ties with local fans.</p>
<p>Latin America has plenty to offer. AC Milan estimates that the club has more than 75 million fans in the region and by teaming up with a well-established local brand such as Betsson, the club will be able to access these fans easier. Everyone at AC Millan is excited to embark on this partnership, Stylsvig confirmed.</p>
<p>Betsson has been working actively to maintain its presence in the North American and South American regions. Most recently, the company expanded its partnership with Paysafe in Colorado, just a few weeks after entering the state through the Betsafe brand. Over the past months, Betsson has been reshuffling its executive lineup, adding new faces to its board, including Roland Glasfors among others.</p>
