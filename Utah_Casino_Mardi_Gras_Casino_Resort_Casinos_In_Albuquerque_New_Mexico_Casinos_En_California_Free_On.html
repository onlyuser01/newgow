<p>In 2019, 5W developed two specialized divisions for gaming and esports after working with several clients in the industry. The agency saw an opportunity in a market that hasn’t used public relations services traditionally. After receiving numerous inquiries, the agency quickly realized the need for its services, which is why it was only natural to create a specified gaming division focused on providing innovative communication strategies and programs that promote gaming and change the public’s perception of it.</p>
<p>The services included product launches, expansion campaigns, speaking opportunities, digital media campaigns, and more. The two divisions started working together to provide only the best approach to gaming and esports clients and help them remain ahead of the curve in one of the most competitive industries.</p>
