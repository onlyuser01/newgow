<p>Mr Green, the self-described “gentleman of online casino operators” will be shutting down its Mr Green Sportsbook in the United Kingdom. The operator informed its British fans about the decision and provided them with all the information they might want to know about their pending bets.</p>
<p>Mr Green to Shut Down in the UK</p>
<p>Mr Green shared that its UK-facing sportsbook will be shutting down on September 8. From September 6 to 8 players will be able to access the sportsbook to check their bets and bet history. During these 48 hours, punters will be unable to place any new wagers, the operator informed them.</p>
<p>Fans that have placed prior bets that are yet to be resolved should not worry as the operator announced that they will not be canceled. On the contrary, Mr Green promised to honor all bets that are due for settlement after its sportsbook has closed. This will be done when the bets’ respective markets have been settled.</p>
<p>Mr Green informed its fans that all winnings will be automatically sent to players’ accounts. Bettors will be able to withdraw them whenever they want without any restrictions. The operator urged fans to contact its customer support workers viа live chat if they have any questions about the upcoming shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr Green’s Ireland Sporstbook will continue to operate as usual. The operator emphasized that the upcoming shutdown will only affect customers in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Mr Green Has Encountered Some Challenges</p>
<p>This shutdown comes a few months after Mr Green ceased its sports betting operations in Germany. At the beginning of 2022, the operator announced that it will no longer be providing sports betting offerings in the country. Subsequently, the operator shut down its German-facing sportsbook with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Although Mr Green’s decision to stop offering sports betting in the United Kingdom may come off as a surprise to some bettors, the company’s decision to pull back from the German market wasn’t as shocking. Other notable companies, such as Kindred Group’s Unibet brand have also left the German market because of its strict regulations.</p>
<p>In other news, Mr Green was previously fined by the Kansspelautoriteit, the Netherlands’ gambling regulator. The operator’s transgression was offering its products in the Dutch market despite lacking a license. The William Hill-owned operator tried to appeal KSA’s fine as it claimed it did not target the Netherlands on purpose. The case was taken to court but the judges ruled in the KSA’s favor.</p>
