    <h1>Morongo Casino Rooms Atlantis Hotel Casino Century Casino Hotel Cripple Creek Cripple Creek Co Doubl</h1>

<p>I have a pending withdrawal at Wildz casino's sister casino Spinz casino. It's been over three days now. They told me from Spinz casino to upload a document to Wildz casino regarding the phone bill document. My game account at Wildz casino was registered approximately three years ago. The phone bill is not available on paper or electronically at all, because the phone number I registered there when creating a game account is a prepaid phone subscription. My withdrawal has not yet been approved due to the phone bill document which is not available for proof anyway as it is simply not available with this operator. On the website with information about the operator of the phone number it is said:</p>
<p>You cannot register a prepaid subscription in your own name or with your social security number. The prepaid number cannot be transferred to another connection or to another operator.</p>
<p>All normally required documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address (electric bill) and bank statement, have been successfully uploaded to both casinos and accepted on behalf of the casinos. In no casino before has a withdrawal been caught due to the fact that the phone bill cannot be delivered, and as I said, the game account is a few years old, which means that the phone number could also have changed after registration. With Wildz, my game account email is a<strong><em>@hotmail.com and with Spinz, a</em></strong>@luukku.com</p>
<p>I am ready to cooperate, requiring additional information to resolve the issue. I hope you can help in this matter, because the previous conversations in the chat in the last few days have been talk-to-the-hand style. I don't think that it is possible for the withdrawal to remain unreceived because of the phone bill document that is impossible to get to the prepaid subscription number registered to the game account three years ago.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
