<p>Digital sports media company Playmaker announced today a strategic partnership in the sports betting product and content space with MetaBet aimed at increasing user engagement and integration of conversion tools.</p>
<p>Engagement and Conversion at Scale</p>
<p>The deal between Playmaker and the provider of automated and contextual sports betting products MetaBet will see the integration of conversion tools directly into Playmaker’s sports-focused editorial content to help the media company boost its interaction with audiences.</p>
<p>The partnership was hailed as an important step of Playmaker’s strategy of “becoming an affiliate leader in the sports betting and gaming industry” by Playmaker chief executive officer Jordan Gnat.</p>
<p>“By implementing contextual tools that enable users to access sports betting markets more seamlessly, MetaBet is providing Playmaker with solutions that improve our capability to deliver our ecosystem of highly engaged sports fans to sports betting operators globally.” Jordan Gnat, CEO, Playmaker</p>
<p>The digital media company that delivers authentic content experiences through its sports media and technology brands will utilize MetaBet’s content automation platform, including functionalities such as game and prop tiles, odds comparison tables, interactive bet calculators, affiliate tracking URLs and links out to sportsbooks’ event pages with an integrated bet slip, and others.</p>
<p>Metabet’s co-founder Benn Gurton was delighted at the opportunity to “work closely with the Playmaker team” and its leading sports media brands to deliver audiences with “engaging, relevant betting content tools” that will help them “make informed decisions.”</p>
<p>“Our contextual product integrations will provide Playmaker with a set of engagement and monetization tools to drive the highest interaction from its audiences, collect meaningful data, and convert in a financially efficient manner.” Benn Gurton, Co-Founder, MetaBet</p>
<p>Connecting Audiences with Betting Markets</p>
<p>The seamless integration of MetaBet’s collection of monetization tools into Playmaker’s sports content will power a hybrid of affiliate and direct advertising that will generate additional revenue with sports betting operators for the digital media company by connecting Playmaker audiences with sports betting markets.</p>
<p>Operating media brands such as Futbol Sites, Yardbarker, and The Nation Network, Playmaker is currently ranked as the largest regional digital sports media group in the Latin American region, where it recently acquired Mexico-based video-first Spanish-language platform Cracks.</p>
<p>Earlier, the media group that creates and delivers sports content to an audience of more than 85 million unique users and ranks sixth in the digital sports media space across all of the Americas expanded its reach in Brazil via the acquisition of sports editorial consultants Futmarketing.</p>
