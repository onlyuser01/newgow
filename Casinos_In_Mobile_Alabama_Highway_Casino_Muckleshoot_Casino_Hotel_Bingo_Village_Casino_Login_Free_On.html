<p>Safari Gold Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Set on the African savanna, Safari Gold Megaways is a sharply put together game, with a slew of majestically rendered wild animals. A snarling cheetah, gloomy buffalo, and sinister elephant all support the king of the beasts, a lion.</p>
<p>This game takes players on a tour of the African grasslands, in search of the most interesting wildlife the continent has to offer.</p>
<p>Big win in the Safari Gold Megaways slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are solid (as Megaways skins often are) and the animals are rendered in ways that make them seem dynamic and exotic.</p>
<p>The animations are clean and short and add enough character to proceedings to keep things tripping along.</p>
<p>The soundtrack works well enough that it doesn’t break the feel of being located deep in the grasslands of a wild and wonderful nature reserve.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Megaways in the title indicates that this version of Safari Gold takes advantage of the Megaways system. This is a licensable system in which the number of symbols on each reel is randomised.</p>
<p>In the case of this slot, each of the six reels gets between two to six symbols. The number of symbols changes for each reel every single spin.</p>
<p>To work with this, the game uses an any way wins system to determine payouts. This means that winning combinations are formed by three or more matching symbols (or two or more in the case of the Lion symbol). These must be in adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>A cascade feature removes all winning combinations at the end of a spin. New symbols then drop down from above. Any new winning combos pay out. After that, the new winning symbols are removed in turn. This continues until there are no more winning combos.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Four or more Scatter symbols trigger the Free Spin bonus. The number of free spins is randomised as is the starting multiplier. During Free Spins, the multiplier increases by one for each cascade. The multiplier then resets to the level of the starting multiplier at the end of each free spin.</p>
<p>Four Scatters will get the player up to 15 free spins, each additional Scatter adds five free spins. You can win additional free spins by landing two or more Scatters during a free spin.</p>
<p>You can also buy directly into the bonus game for twenty times your bet per spin.</p>
<p>First Free Spin sets up the entire bonus round</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%,comfortably over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for Safari Gold Megaways slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Safari Gold Megaways combines good visuals, decent animations, and fun — if simple — bonus features.</p>
<p>The RTP of 96.50% is considered good by us, and in combination with the high volatility results in a perfect slot for our slot strategies.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this slot.</p>
