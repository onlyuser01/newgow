<p>Betsoft Gaming, a provider of premium omni-channel gaming solutions to licensed operators, announced that it has expanded its presence in Latin America with a new agreement. The supplier signed a deal with Cbet, a local casino and sports betting brand seeking to innovate the market.</p>
<p>Betsoft to Help Cbet Innovate</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Betsoft will power its new partner with full access to its acclaimed slots portfolio. As a result, Cbet will be able to engage its players with fan-favorite titles such as Wilds of Fortune, which recently won the Game of the Year award at the Starlet Awards. Betsoft also won the RNG Game Provision award at the Starlet awards and is known for the quality of its content.</p>
<p>Other popular titles that will be added to Cbet’s offering include recent releases such as Golden Dragon Inferno and Woodlanders, as well as classics such as Take the Bank, Stampede and the entire Pop series.</p>
<p>In addition, Cbet will be able to benefit from Betsoft’s recently released Take the Prize mechanics, which offer surprise wins or prizes without interrupting a player’s experience. The new feature does not affect RTP and Tournament and is designed to appeal to seasoned slot games enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Cbet, Betsoft’s new partner, is a progressive sports betting and casino brand that is known for its innovative approach to gaming. The company, founded in 2019, targets primarily the Brazilian and Mexican markets from its headquarters in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>Cbet is quickly conquering the LATAM region with its passionate “minimalist” approach to gaming. It seeks to provide customers with great customer service and speedy payouts. Its dedication to excellence has earned the company 97% “Excellent” reviews on Trustpilot and favorable reviews on other review sites.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Help the Companies Grow</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming’s head of account management, Anastasia Bauer, spoke about the new agreement. She emphasized that her company is keen on maintaining its popularity and growth trajectory in the LATAM region. To that end, her team must forge alliances with the best and most innovative companies in the region, Bauer said.</p>
<p>Partnering with a successful innovator such as Cbet is essential for this strategy. We are delighted to be focusing on their key markets with them and anticipate a very successful long-term relationship. Anastasia Bauer, head of account management, Betsoft Gaming</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cbet’s chief commercial officer, Soto Mora, said that the operator is just as delighted by the opportunity to work with Betsoft Gaming</p>
<p>Partnering with high-quality providers such as Betsoft Gaming is essential for us to maintain and further grow our brand across diverse player bases. We are very much looking forward to a fruitful relationship. Soto Mora, CCO, Cbet</p>
