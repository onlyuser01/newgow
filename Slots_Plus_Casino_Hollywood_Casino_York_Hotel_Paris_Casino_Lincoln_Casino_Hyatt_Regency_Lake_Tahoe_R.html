    <h1>Slots Plus Casino Hollywood Casino York Hotel Paris Casino Lincoln Casino Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe R</h1>

<p>This is going on every form from her to timbucktwo,</p>
<p>This is what you support. A set up and terms and conditions that just aren't avoidable. I seek a professional in getting further help and bringing this casino to play fair.</p>
<p>Nothings been relayed to As if something of the nature is poor policy and held only for people who actually win. Had I not won they would have allowed me to play putting more money forever. But soon an someone wins they look to their unfair t&amp;c for any excuse out. This is listed as this</p>
<p>"Players must keep their registration details up to date. Support Centre should be notified for any changes in address, email, phone number or other contact/personal information."</p>
<p>there's no place to do this as they don't display anything but your long and hard to remember user names.</p>
<p>"Players may only open and operate a single account. Where a Player is identified with more than one account we reserve the right to suspend these accounts and winnings associated with multiple accounts may be confiscated. The Player must also not have used sign up bonuses multiple times."</p>
<p>Undersstood, however that's very indirect as they are saying that if you deposit more then your win, then the account MAY be suspended or left open to keep your deposits. Unfortunately provided there's a win we will suspend and confiscate your winnings.</p>
<p>I try to never use bonuses and the site makes it a automatic thing it's hard not to collect bonus every time you deposit. I like to opt out every chance I get from the get go. LUXURY makes this almost impossible. As well for wager there is not real-time display that keeps track for your peace and mind."</p>
<p>"This promotion must be claimed by making a first deposit within 7 days, after which Luxury Casino reserves the right to modify the promotion."</p>
<p>My account was open more then a month and still these offers were automatic every deposit. What is the point of stating 7 days.</p>
<p>"The first deposit bonus and second deposit bonus are subject to 200 times play-through before your bonus balance is converted to cash."</p>
<p>200x. That's completely unfair and unheard-of They match $1000.00 and you need $1000.00 your own cash and you need wager $200,000.00. You will never win with these auto forced upon bonus amounts.</p>
<p>"All promotions can only be claimed once per device, person, household, family, physical address, email address, financial account, IP address or shared network environment such as a library, workplace, university or school. Any winnings associated with a bonus being claimed more than once will be confiscated and the casino account closed. "</p>
<p>I understand per person. But say you buy a used device or borrow a laptop or lend yours to a friend are you supposed to always mention if your gambling at anyone of 26 or so different casinos then tell me now. Or even more interesting is that they advertise like.crazy third party or not. If I even visit the website of 1 casino I got 4 other ones emailing me right away telling me about bonuses. With the shared network, my friends who are on the same network get similar emails magically to also take the bonus and sign up. Right there they got you violating and they planed it all along.</p>
<p>Whats even better is the express going as far as a whole library and every visitor, day in day out or a whole work place so make sure you keep your winnings a secret if you happen to tell anyone out of excitement because they might log on and try to claim a win too. If you win enough Casino Rewards will nab you there. To top it off a school, how can you even avoid violating a t&amp;c with 1000s of students.</p>
<p>They don't have a form section expressing that we shouldn't sign up if we are from certain workplaces or schools university where colleges have already accepted their spam encouragement to accept an account with automated bonus addons. We've lost before our first spin.. it's pointless. Or better yet how is this even governed around the globe.</p>
<p>"Every effort will be made to credit the Player's account with any promotional bonuses within one business day or sooner. Promotions that are earned over a time period such as weekend or monthly bonuses will be awarded within one business day following the end of that time period i.e. on the Monday after the weekend or on the first business day of the following month."</p>
<p>They are stick a bonus any place they see fit. Basically making you constantly guess if your playing real money or fake bonus point funds. Also keeping you to continuously wager and thus never being able to withdrawl. That's right where they like you.</p>
