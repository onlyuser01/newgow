<p>With five straight wins, the Baltimore Ravens are the most in-form team in the AFC. They did struggle in a couple of games, but they also impressed in some, including their Week 6 game against the LA Chargers.</p>
<p>The game was played in Baltimore and the hosts won 34-6. In Week 7. The Ravens now play in front of their fans once again. Should we expect a similar scenario to play out?</p>
<p>Sure, the Cincinnati Bengals are 4-2, with a big win over the Detroit Lions last week. However, it seems that the player quality is on Baltimore’s side.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson Making an MVP Statement</p>
<p>Ahead of Week 7, the betting odds have moved in favor of Ravens QB Lamar Jackson to win the NFL regular-season MVP award. Sure, he’s not the top candidate, but he’s among the top ones. No surprise there, as he’s been brilliant in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>In Week 6, we saw him setting an NFL record for most wins (35) for QBs under the age of 25. In that game, he went 19-27 for 167 yards and just one touchdown, which was his worst performance of the season.</p>
<p>It wasn’t his best day, but he still managed to do reasonably well. A week before, however, we saw Jackson putting his best performance of the year so far. Against the Indianapolis Colts, the QB went 37-43 for 442 yards and picked up four touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Bengals are (Surprisingly) Flying High</p>
<p>Last season, the Cincinnati Bengals finished with a 4-11-1 record, thus missing the postseason for the fifth straight time. In the 2021 season, they’re doing pretty well.</p>
<p>After six weeks, the Bengals are 4-2, which puts them in second place in the AFC North. The team that’s at the very top of the divisional table is Cincinnati’s next opponent, Baltimore.</p>
<p>By getting a win on Sunday, the Bengals could get to the top. The trouble is that they don’t seem to have the manpower to pull off such a feat.</p>
<p>The thing is that their 2021 schedule hasn’t been too difficult. In fact, so far, they’ve faced some of the worst teams in the league. Last weekend, for example, they beat the Detroit Lions, who are the only NFL team still without a win in 2021. They also beat the Jacksonville Jaguars, who were the worst NFL team last season.</p>
<p>The Bengals also won against the Minnesota Vikings, albeit after overtime which saw their placekicker scoring the winner just five seconds before the end.</p>
<p>They did, however, beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-10 on the road in Week 3, which was probably their best display in a long time.</p>
<p>Still, their next opponent is much tougher than all the aforementioned teams. With that said, we can’t expect anything other than a dominant win for the Ravens.</p>
<p>Pick: Baltimore Ravens to win and cover the spread; the over should hit.</p>
