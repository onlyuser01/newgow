    <h1>Casinos In Colorado St Kitts Marriott Resort The Royal Beach Casino Turning Stone Resort Casino Phot</h1>

<p>Dear Dylan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions (here) and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"9. Right of demand</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>9.4. Due to legal reasons we do not accept any Clients from the following countries:</p>
<p>9.4.1. Absolute Restriction. No customers will be accepted from USA, Canada, UK, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, Albania, Barbados, Pakistan, Syria, South Sudan, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Jamaica, North Korea, Malta and Panama. Any persons residing or located on the territory of those countries are not permitted to open accounts or to make any money funds on the Internet site. Amendments shall be possible in the list of the jurisdictions and they may be performed by the Company without any prior notification of the Clients. You agree that you will not open the account or transfer any money funds to it being located within the territory of either of the above-listed jurisdictions."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize a very important fact from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"The right thing to do is to check for restricted countries during the account creation process, and to not allow players from restricted countries to register and play. If the casino knows about restricted countries and also knows the player's country of residence, it's not a big issue to enforce this rule.</p>
<p>If the casino allows a player from a restricted country to play because it hasn't implemented this check, it should accept that it was the casino's mistake and pay out all winnings to the player despite the fact that they shouldn't have been allowed to play in the first place, provided that the player hasn't done anything else that's against the rules."</p>
<p>Could you please advise how much is your active balance now?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
