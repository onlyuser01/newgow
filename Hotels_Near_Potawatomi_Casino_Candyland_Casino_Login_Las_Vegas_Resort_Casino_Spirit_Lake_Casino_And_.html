<p>The leading international iGaming provider, SOFTSWISS, has announced support for a global environmental initiative in Poland. Representatives of the company confirmed its commitment to sustainable growth and protecting the environment by joining the 30th Cleaning up the World campaign in Poznan, Poland.</p>
<p>This year's event saw the participation of approximately 130 teams from different companies around the globe. Joining forces, all team members showed that cumulative efforts can help completely rejuvenate a significant area in Poznan. The initiative helped transform the city into an eco-friendlier environment and an overall cleaner place.</p>
<p>Supporting ecological activities and promoting awareness of their importance is a part of SOFTSWISS' core values. The company currently has a proactive approach to social responsibility and doesn't only support environmental initiatives but also partakes in different endeavors around the world by providing vital support for victims of military conflicts and natural disasters. At the same time, SOFTSWISS is committed to multicultural cooperation and supports individuals facing serious illnesses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after the tragic natural disaster events in Turkey, SOFTSWISS confirmed it donated some $25,000 for container houses for people left without homes. Throughout 2022, the company has allocated some €1.7m toward different charity initiatives.</p>
<p>Valentina Bagniya, SOFTSWISS' Chief Marketing Officer, commented on the topic in a statement, explaining that the sustainable development of any company requires a "clearly defined mission and a robust values system." Additionally, she highlighted the importance of different principles the company has shown commitment to.</p>
<p>Bagniya added: "While cultivating both personal responsibility of our team members and social responsibility within the entire company, we take measurable steps including charitable contributions, active engagement in philanthropic initiatives, and participating in eco-friendly activities." Finally, SOFTSWISS' Chief Marketing Officer pointed out: "The alignment of our employees around these shared values significantly enhances the quality of our output."</p>
<p>Katsiaryna Shved, SOFTSWISS' Event Manager of Employer Brand, added: "We truly embrace the power of positive change, recognizing the profound impact that each person’s contribution holds." Last but not least, she said: "Together, we are making real and noticeable changes that we can see, touch, and feel."</p>
<p>Recently, SOFTSWISS confirmed it boosted its Game Aggregator portfolio with titles from BetGames, the leading provider of live betting products. Announced last week, the collaboration saw SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator gain access to the provider's collection of live dealer betting games, strengthening the offering available for its customers. As a result, partners of the Game Aggregator gained access to thrilling titles from BetGames, including Lucky 7 and Lotto range games, among other top-performing titles.</p>
