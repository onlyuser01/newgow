<p>The globally recognized online sports betting company, bet365, announced a new partnership paving its entry into the regulated gambling market in Pennsylvania. On Monday, the company revealed its wholly-owned US subsidiary joined forces with Presque Isle Downs &amp; Casino, a subsidiary of Churchill Downs Incorporated.</p>
<p>The terms of the new multi-year collaboration grant market access for iGaming and online sports betting services for bet365 in Pennsylvania. Still, it's important to mention that the deal is subject to the relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 9, 2023, a spokesperson for bet365 said: "Off the heels of our launch in Ohio, we are thrilled to announce our partnership with Churchill Downs Incorporated."</p>
<p>Finally, the company's spokesperson pointed out: "Once live, the world's favorite online sports betting brand will be available to sports fans in Pennsylvania, offering fantastic site features, including Bet Boosts, Same Game Parlay, Cash Out and Edit Bet, on top of our market-leading sign-up offer."</p>
<p>On the other hand, CDI's CEO, Bill Carstanjen, explained that the company is delighted to join forces with such a leading operator within the global online betting industry. "Our relationship with bet365 enables us to maximize the value of our company's sports betting and iGaming market access in Pennsylvania," said CDI's CEO in conclusion.</p>
<p>The new market access multi-year agreement complements bet365's plan for further growth in different US markets. At the same time, the collaboration boosts CDI's plan to shift from casino and online sports businesses and focus on the growth of its TwinSpires online horse racing operations.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration comes after only recently, bet365 significantly boosted its existing deal with Sports Information Services (SIS). As a result, SIS delivered a new live betting lottery product for bet365.</p>
<p>The new product, called Lotto365, delivers live betting action daily and expands bet365's offering further. According to the product developer, the online lottery game gives players a chance to win up to £100,000 by placing only a single £1 bet, given that they guess all numbers correctly.</p>
<p>Before that, the duo joined forces in December when bet365 tapped into SIS' Competitive Gaming solution for the esports market in New Jersey. The unique product enabled the leading operator to expand its presence into the esports betting vertical.</p>
<p>Besides a strong presence in the US, bet365 is a company famous as the largest online sports betting operator on a global scale. Its sportsbook revenues surpass $4 billion every year and currently, its workforce has more than 6,000 members around the world. bet365 offers betting markets for more than 75 sports and more than 780,000 events streamed live annually.</p>
