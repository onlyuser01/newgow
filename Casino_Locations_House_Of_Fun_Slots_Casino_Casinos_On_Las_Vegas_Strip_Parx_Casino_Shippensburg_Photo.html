<p>Delasport, an iGaming company with over 25 years in the management and delivery of sports betting and gaming platforms, has expanded its international clout further through the acquisition of a Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) license. The new permit will allow the company to scale its business-to-business offering across Europe and jurisdictions that recognize the MGA license.</p>
<p>Delasport Welcomes MGA License and Opportunities It Entails</p>
<p>Delasport will be able to deliver its player account management (PAM) option to new partners. The platform can be integrated with the sports betting and casino platform solutions offered by Delasport which is usually the go-to choice for most business partners. There is also the turnkey and plug &amp; play Sportsbook iFrame which can be integrated into the customer’s preferences.</p>
<p>Delasport CEO Oren Cohen Schwartz has welcomed the developments and said that the company was extremely happy with the MGA B2B license which recognized both the company’s efforts in building some of the best casino and sports solutions. Schwartz welcomed the opportunity:</p>
<p>“The MGA license is an important milestone in our market’s availability strategy. In 2022, we plan to enter several new regulated markets around the globe to meet with our partners’ expansion strategy.” Delasport CEO Oren Cohen Schwartz</p>
<p>Delasport has been upping its regulatory game on a national level as well, including breaking into the Romanian market with a national license. The company signed a B2B partnership to power TV Global Enterprises’ iGaming offer in February. Delasport has rejuggled its executive team as well in January, adding Filippo Ferri as its new chief compliance officer.</p>
<p>Thanks to the MGA license, Delasport will be able to double down on its presence in North America and Europe. Both are increasingly important markets with recent regulatory push in key markets such as Ontario in Canada and the Netherlands and the re-regulated gaming market in Germany in Europe.</p>
