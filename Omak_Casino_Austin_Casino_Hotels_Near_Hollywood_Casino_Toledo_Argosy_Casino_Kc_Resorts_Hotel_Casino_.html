<p>Two Premier League giants clash this Thursday at Old Trafford. With the help of their fans, Manchester United players are hoping they could get a good result, which could be essential for their Top 4 efforts. Their goal for the season is to finish in a spot that leads to the Champions League.</p>
<p>However, it’s fair to say that things aren’t going according to plan right now. Manchester United lost three of its previous four EPL games, the result of which is that they’re now sitting in the #6 position with six points fewer than Arsenal, the team from the #6 place.</p>
<p>As there are only a few more games left to be played before the end of the season, winning point(s) on Thursday is of utmost importance. The trouble is that the Red Devils are locking horns with one of the best teams on the planet that would love nothing better than ruin their rival’s dreams.</p>

<p>Manchester United Needs to Start Winning Again</p>
<p>In the previous four EPL rounds, Manchester United lost three times. The teams that defeated the Red Devils are Everton, Liverpool, and Arsenal. The game they didn’t lose was a win over Norwich. The final score in that game was 3-1 Man United, with all three goals being scored by Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>He’s been by far their best player this season, but even his efforts haven’t been enough. Still, the Red Devils do still stand a chance to salvage the season. By that, we mean that they can still secure a top 4 finish. For that to happen, however, these guys need to start playing better. Unfortunately, their schedule isn’t easy, starting with the game with Chelsea.</p>
<p>Chelsea Playing Well Lately</p>
<p>Their journey in the Champions League ended three weeks ago, but the former champions didn’t embarrass themselves. In fact, they’ve been laying amazing soccer over the last couple of weeks. Their most recent game was a 1-0 over West Ham, in which Christian Pulisic scored the match-winner in the 90th minute.</p>
<p>A few days before, they also beat Crystal Palace 2-0 in the semifinal of the FA Cup. That remains the only competition in which they still have a chance of winning the trophy. In the Premier League, they are likely to stay in the #3 position. In fact, whatever happens in the remainder of the season, they probably aren’t going to drop out of the top 4.</p>
<p>Manchester United vs Chelsea</p>
<p>Another failure is not an option for Manchester United. Still, the Red Devils don’t look like a team that could beat Chelsea, at least not easily. However, getting a point on Thursday might be achievable. In fact, knowing that each of their previous three meetings finished in a draw, such an outcome looks like a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>Pick: Manchester and Chelsea to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
