<p>A Sioux Falls, South Dakota man was arrested on seven charges this week. That’s after he allegedly robbed the city’s Aces Casino and sexually assaulted an employee at the property.</p>

<p>Marian Brooks, 36, walked into the South Cliff Avenue gaming property with his shirt pulled up over his face at about 11 p.m. Tuesday, according to Dakota News Now.</p>
<p>A 52-year-old female clerk was in a back room and heard a knock on the door. She opened the door because she thought the visitor was a patron. But as Brooks approached, he aimed a firearm at her and demanded money, police said.</p>
<p>She gave him an undisclosed amount of casino cash but instead of fleeing immediately, he allegedly threw the woman to the floor and sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>Brooks then fled the scene before the victim called local police and described her assailant. Police checked the casino’s surveillance video and developed a description of Brooks, who was located at about 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday near 8th Street and South Indiana Avenue.</p>
<p>When police officers searched him, they found a handgun tucked into his waistband.</p>
<p>The victim was treated by physicians following the attack and didn’t suffer any serious physical injuries, according to Sioux Falls’ Argus Leader.</p>
<p>Stolen Firearm</p>
<p>The firearm discovered in Brooks’ possession was stolen last Friday from an unlocked car at a Caroline Avenue hotel, police said.</p>
<p>Brooks was charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree rape, two counts of aggravated grand theft (for the cash and stolen gun), possession of a firearm by a former violent offender, committing a felony with a firearm, and aggravated assault.</p>
<p>If found guilty on the charges, Brooks, who has a “long criminal history,” according to Sioux Falls TV station KELO, faces prison sentences of many years.</p>
<p>Anti-Theft Campaign</p>
<p>The casino robbery and gun theft comes after Sioux Falls approved a new initiative to prevent thefts related to unlocked cars.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Sioux Falls City Council okayed $50K that will be used for an awareness campaign by the Sioux Falls Police Department to encourage residents to keep their cars locked.</p>
<p>In 2022, local police received 1,361 reports of stolen vehicles. Police spokesman Sam Clemens said 90% of those thefts took place after someone left keys in the car, the Argus Leader reported.</p>
<p>Many times, weapons are left in cars and later stolen.</p>
<p>“We know that people look for guns in unlocked cars,” Clemens added. “They find those guns; they commit other crimes with them.”</p>
