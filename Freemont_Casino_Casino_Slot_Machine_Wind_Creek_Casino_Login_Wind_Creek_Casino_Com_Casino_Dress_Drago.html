<p>Dragons Lucky 8 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>What does everyone think of when they think of lucky Chinese dragons? Probably not fruit. But that is the combination Dragons Lucky 8 is built around: dragons and fruit.</p>
<p>Not just any fruit either. Instead of cherries and watermelon, its reels are adorned with cantaloupe, peaches, grapes, apples, and pineapples. There are also dragons occasionally, and a golden tiger. But for the most part players should get used to salivating over fruit salad.</p>
<p>This rather unusual combination is further confused by the rural Chinese setting of the background, which feels divorced from the eurocentric fruit and the mythical world of dragons. However, when you put it all together, the excellent artwork and music somehow makes this theme work. To whit…</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The choice of theme may be somewhat mysterious but, once chosen, it has been executed marvellously. The fruit are unique and well-chosen, drawn in a way that fits with the colour palette and the style of the slot.</p>
<p>The music is a little more mysterious, blending classical chinese and synth strings into a pleasing and unusual soundtrack that goes well with the various win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>The animations are clear, clean, and solid, but they add very little to the slot’s overall atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Dragons Lucky 8 is played on six reels with three rows each and 20 win lines.</p>
<p>The win multipliers help to keep things interesting in the base game, and for players looking for a little more variety there is a gamble feature that can be played after every winning spin. This feature allows players to go double or nothing with their winnings.</p>
<p>There is also a free spin bonus for the luckier players.</p>
<p>Multiplier changes often in this slot machine</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and the Variable Win Multiplier symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels will net the player 15, 20, 25, or 30 free spins for three, four, five or six Scatters respectively.</p>
<p>For getting even higher variance there is a gamble feature</p>
<p>Only one Variable Win Multiplier symbol can appear per spin. When one does appear, it alters the current multiplier to either x1, x3, x5 or x8. This multiplier remains in effect for all subsequent spins until another Variable Win Multiplier symbol lands on the reels.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.54%, a touch over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The player can choose the volatility of this game using a button in the corner of the base game. Players can choose between three volatility settings: high, medium, and low. We suggest the highest setting if you are following our slot strategies.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With its combination of a healthy fruit salad and a side of golden Chinese dragons, Dragons Lucky 8 is an oddball slot from a thematic stand point.</p>
<p>However, as if to make up for this, its gameplay is largely straightforward (a little multiplier gimmick notwithstanding) and its other design elements are pretty middle of the road. Solid, but not outstanding.</p>
<p>The RTP is pretty good at 96.54%. And the adjustable volatility that Wazdan tend to offer always appeals to us, as it gives players more control and allows us to choose the high-volatility that we prefer for our slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, this slot gets a thumbs up.</p>
