    <h1>Casino New Mexico Casinos Chicago Cesars Casinos Horseshoe Casino Hammond In Paris Casino Restaurant</h1>

<p>Online casino software brand SoftSwiss announced it signed deals with 4 new third party clients among which a multi-crypto currency casino platform, to expand on product growth and distribution of its Affilka affiliate platform.</p>
<p>Track and Monitor Affiliate Performance Real-Time</p>
<p>The SoftSwiss affiliate platform allows online gaming operators to track and analyze their affiliates in real-time, providing invaluable information in terms of marketing performance. The standalone tool also allows products from several gaming brands or sportsbooks to be united under one referral program.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to introduce our very first third party client, who will expanded our business partner network within the Affilka solution. The integration with a third-party platform is a major step in the Affilka development plan.” Anastasia Borovaya, Product Owner, Affilka, SoftSwiss</p>
<p>Affilka also features built-in payment processing methods and an advanced commission calculating tool to provide automated payouts to affiliate partners, besides powerful reporting and in-depth analytics. The affiliate platform proved its worth for a variety of gaming brands operating on the SoftSwiss Online Casino Platform.</p>
<p>Breaking New Ground</p>
<p>Signing a deal to add the crypto-currency casino BC.Game to the Affilka platform marked a significant milestone in the platform’s client portfolio expansion, strengthening its global footprint by entering new ground.</p>
<p>“The deal will accelerate our reach into the market as a standalone affiliate tracking product. In the nearest future, we expect Affilka’s further massive brand growth as well as expansion into new exciting markets.” Anastasia Borovaya, Product Owner, Affilka, SoftSwiss</p>
<p>Besides the integration to the affiliate platform, BC.Game and SoftSwiss, via the BGaming sub-brand game aggregator of the software supplier, entered into an agreement for cooperation, to roll out games developed by the SoftSwiss sub-brand and a number of other popular game providers to the casino platform.</p>
<p>The Affilka affiliate platform is not the single area of interest for the software developer as its new adapted sportsbook solutions recently debuted in India, South Korea and Japan to confirm SoftSwiss’ intention to expand into Asia.</p>
<p>The company’s top-notch gaming content which is now available in Japanese and Korean languages offered through its Online Casino Platform and tailored for the individual markets, provides a maximum user-friendly experience by allowing local payment systems such as Arubex, InPay and VenusPoint.</p>
<p>In another press release in December, SoftSwiss announced its robust anti-fraud and security software solutions with multiple levels of protection, including bonus abuse checks and blocking duplicate player accounts, allowed for a quick identification of player suspicious behavior and saved its clients a staggering €10 million for 2020 alone.</p>
