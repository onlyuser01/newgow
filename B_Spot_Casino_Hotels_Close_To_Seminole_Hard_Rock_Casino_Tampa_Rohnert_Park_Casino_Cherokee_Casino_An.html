<p>After improved COVID-19 data and mitigation efforts, the Mitigation and Management Task Force announced that bars in Clark and Elko County can reopen on September 20.</p>
<p>The Nevada COVID-19 Mitigation and Management Task Force announced its plan to reopen bars in Clark and Elko County. The announcement came yesterday when the Task Force said that, the bars, pubs, taverns, breweries, distilleries, and wineries in those counties can reopen after Sunday, September 20, 11:59 P.M. According to the Task Force, the reopening is the result of “improved data and mitigation efforts”.</p>
<p>Ensuring the safety of visitors and guests, those businesses must operate at a 50% capacity limit. Furthermore, the businesses must also follow the statewide standards for health and safety operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although bars in the two counties were allowed to reopen, the Task Force is yet to reveal when those businesses will be allowed to reopen in Churchill, Eureka, Lyon, and Washoe counties.</p>
<p>Nevada #COVID19 Mitigation &amp; Management Task Force has voted to allow bars &amp; taverns to re-open in Las #Vegas &amp; #ClarkCounty, effective Sunday 11:59pm. #SocialDistancing guidelines must be followed. #Coronavirus — Clark County Nevada (@ClarkCountyNV) September 17, 2020</p>
<p>Starting from September 20, after being closed for two months, the businesses will finally reopen their doors for visitors. Here, it is important to mention that many of the bars in Clark and Elko counties operate as restricted gaming locations. In Clark County alone, there are more than 13,000 slot machines in more than 1,600 restricted gaming locations, which will be allowed to reopen on September 20.</p>
<p>In that line of thought, we cannot miss saying that in Nevada there are more than 17,600 slot machines positioned in more than 2,450 restricted gaming locations, according to data by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. With that in mind, the reopening of bars will undoubtedly lead to a boost in the state’s coffers with fresh tax revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Steve Sisolak Shared His Excitement about the Lifting of Restrictions for Bars</p>
<p>The Task Force announcement came the same day when Governor Steve Sisolak announced that some COVID-19 restrictions may loosen up. In a statement, the Governor shared his excitement about the positive news by the Task Force.</p>
<p>“I am beyond thrilled that the hard work of Nevada’s residents and businesses has resulted in our COVID-19 data trending in a positive direction, allowing the Task Force to lift restrictions on bars in counties that previously had these mitigation measures in place due to their transmission risk levels,” wrote Governor Sisolak</p>
<p>He outlined that he has constantly supported the safe lifting of restrictions which will result in the improvement of the social and economic life. According to Governor Sisolak, the results of the Task Force represent the commitment of the Silver State’s officials for “transparent process, a safe reopening, and coordinated partnerships with our local governments”. In conclusion, the Governor thanked the Task Force and the local governments for their hard work of accomplishing the overall goal of safely lifting restrictions based on coordinated data.</p>
