    <h1>Dreams Casino No Deposit Mohegan Casino Las Vegas Casino Elk Grove Aquarius Laughlin Hotel And Casin</h1>

<p>Evolution, the premier supplier of live dealer casino products, has extended its partnership with FanDuel Group amid the rapid adoption of iGaming in the United States. As a result of this partnership, Evolution will remain the exclusive live gaming provider for FanDuel across the country.</p>
<p>Recognizing the Potential of Live Casino Games</p>
<p>As the iGaming market opens up and new legislation emerges, FanDuel’s casino brand is gaining momentum in regulated markets, and not least thanks to Evolution’s portfolio of distinct and award-winning products. Since 2020, the two companies have been working together to introduce more live dealer tables in key jurisdictions, including New Jersey.</p>
<p>Evolution, which owns Ezugi, has provided both its banner and subsidiaries games. The deal extension will allow FanDuel to offer players Evolution live dealer tables anywhere where the operator and suppliers have a license to operate.</p>
<p>To elevate the experience, Evolution is working on creating a dedicated gaming environment for FanDuel players based in its studios in Michigan and Pennsylvania. This is a forthcoming solution that will take several months to complete, the company explained in a press release.</p>
<p>FanDuel is also tapping into other realms of the experience thanks to Evolution. The operator will introduce slots by Evolution brands and integrate a selection of First Person games into its gaming suite. Red Tiger and NetEnt will present players with further opportunities to enjoy and explore branded and premium slots.</p>
<p>Happy with the Partnership Continuation</p>
<p>FanDuel Group general manager of casino Jesse Chemtob praised the partnership and the latest extension. Evolution has been a trusted and reliable partner over the past years, Chemtob explained, adding:</p>
<p>“When we first signed with Evolution in 2020, we made it clear that we saw live casino as a key driver for continued growth in the US. We have been extremely happy with the quality and performance of Evolution titles on our platform. We’re excited to expand and enhance our live dealer table games product offering to bring a best-in-market branded experience to our customers.” FanDuel Group general manager of casino Jesse Chemtob</p>
<p>Evolution commercial director North America Jeff Millar welcomed the opportunity to extend what has been a successful partnership. Millar said that FanDuel sees the potential of live games in online casinos.</p>
<p>“We are proud to have been chosen as FanDuel’s live dealer table games provider in the regulated US online gaming market,” he added. Evolution is committed to providing FanDuel with the full range of experience, thus repaying the operator’s confidence in the supplier.</p>
