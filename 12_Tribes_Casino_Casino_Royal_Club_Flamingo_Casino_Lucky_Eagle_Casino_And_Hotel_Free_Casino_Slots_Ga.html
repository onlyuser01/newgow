<p>The new agreement with Spotlight Sports Group will bring the entire international content provided by the Superfeed to Catena Media to allow its global brand portfolio to expand into new sports and languages.</p>
<p>Commenting on the exciting arrangement with Spotlight Sports Group, Isabel Hale, the head of north division international at Catena Media outlined all the credentials of Spotlight Sports Group which weighed in for the decision to enter the partnership.</p>
<p>“We chose Spotlight Sports Group as we know the quality, depth, and breadth of their content and data is the best around and will benefit our brands with their insightful betting analysis,” stated Hale, hailing the “innovative Superfeed content engine” as the best outlet to provide the information Catena Media customers need to “make betting decisions.”</p>
<p>The agreement will allow Catena Media to overhaul its horse racing-focused websites GG.co.uk and racingtips.com by utilizing industry-leading racing data and content in over 80 languages from more than 60,000 races per year provided by the Superfeed engine.</p>
<p>Breaking News from the World of Sports</p>
<p>In addition, Spotlight Sports Group will deliver hundreds of articles a day covering events from every sport to inform Catena Media customers on the breaking news around the globe as soon as they happen.</p>

<p>“This integration will allow us the opportunity to access the full range of content and analysis that Superfeed has to offer on an international scale,” Harman concluded.</p>
