<p>hi it's not so cool, because these are the tricks of the casino, it's the 1st step. if it doesn't help and you can still play even though you turned off the internet to restart roulette, the royal panda did it to me more and more often, the 2nd step is that in its history you won't have a win, a lot, but only a win, and you play on a cryptomen casinos where the cryptocurrency is constantly changing and then when you don't know your lottery ticket, and when you have a winnings bet and you can't see how much you bet, how much the crypto is constantly changing, so you're fucked and you're blindly blindfolding your balance on honor don't spend as much as your account you only have in your wallet I'm convinced that 99% of casinos are fraudulent when a player wins therefore no casino has a rating of 9.9 / 10, only the stones of the casino, online casinos will be fraudulently .... a vicious circle.</p>
<p>thanks for your time spent answering ....</p>
