    <h1>Boomtown Casino Rosies Casino Emerald Queen Hotel Casino Lawrenceburg Casino Casino Betting Bizzo Ca</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Your perhaps former colleague (Mr. Kováč, if I remember, he wrote in Slovak) did not want to understand at any cost that someone could be in positive winning values, until the total statement from the casino that he requested and where are all deposits and withdrawals and the total balance of the account for the entire period he "broke" it a little (it was +9700 Euros), but still he did not forgive the remarks that I would lose it....it didn't come, on the contrary...furthermore, he did not even want to admit the possibility of a "technical error" by the casino, after describing the case and the screenshot changed his mind a bit and asked if I wanted to complain to the casino where it happened and that you could be helpful.....the problem was that the error that occurred happened to me personally several times and once in MY benefit, so why complain.....for me it was + 96,000 CZK....yes, you read that right....so no one will keep me away from the keyboard and "milk" on my chin (don't take it personally) and tens of thousands of spins to interpret something, something that he himself has not experienced and cannot understand, because he has a "programmed" brain (after all, you can't make money by playing, you never he tried and he prefers to get paid for the wisdom he spreads from someone else - he has the right to do so, but I have a different principle - show what you have achieved and then talk or write about it)...... today I am retired (I worked also in the IT field and I can "calculate" a lot of things by myself) and I have "gambling" as fun and extra income for retirement..... if you use common sense, you will learn the hard way!!!!!!!!!!! !!! discipline, no matter what happens and you set a REAL goal, it is possible to win... yes, there are also losses, but you have to count with them... it's about the overall + - at the end of each month, and that's about what goes</p>
