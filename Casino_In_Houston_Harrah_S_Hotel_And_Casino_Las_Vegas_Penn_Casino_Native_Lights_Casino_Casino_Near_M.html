<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, NFL fans around the world will tap into NHL-themed virtual sports games</p>
<p>Global gaming content and technology company Aristocrat Gaming, announced a new deal with the fast-growing provider of content, technology, services and hardware for the regulated betting, gaming and lottery industry, Inspired Entertainment. Under the terms of the new partnership announced Friday, Aristocrat confirmed it will deliver virtual sports experiences from Inspired for the National Football League (NFL).</p>
<p>The delivery of the new virtual sports experiences is facilitated via Aristocrat’s multi-year licensing agreement with the League. Thanks to the collaboration, new NFL-themed virtual sports simulations will enable sports fans and bettors alike to engage in “head-to-head in fast-paced, ultra-realistic simulated matchups.”</p>
<p>The new simulations will offer the users options just like a standard sportsbook such as over/under, money line bets and more. To further strengthen the engagement with the NFL, the virtual sports simulations will feature different NFL-themed images including all 32 team logos, the famous NFL shield, the Super Bowl, AFC and NFC Conference logos.</p>
<p>The Deal Brings Excitement to Inspired, Aristocrat</p>
<p>Brooks Pierce, Inspired’s president and CEO, explained that the company is delighted to join forces with Aristocrat and the NFL. He pointed out that the collaboration will deliver unique experiences for NFL fans even during the off-season. Finally, Pierce said that the company is looking forward to seeing the partnership lift off and engage with millions of NFL fans.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to work with the NFL and Aristocrat Gaming on this historic new simulated gaming experience to bring fans a unique way to connect with the game, even in the off-season.“ Brooks Pierce, president and CEO of Inspired Entertainment</p>
<p>Hector Fernandez, Aristocrat Gaming’s CEO, shared similar excitement about the latest announcement. He pointed out that Inspired will help connect NFL fans and deliver engaging entertainment. Finally, he noted: “As part of our overall NFL strategy, we are thrilled to tap into the global appeal the NFL offers to current and new fans and casino, sports betting, and lottery players.”</p>
<p>“Through Inspired, this NFL license expansion into virtual sports presents a ground-breaking entertainment option that’s never been done before.“ Hector Fernandez, CEO of Aristocrat Gaming</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Aristocrat’s Anaxi announced a new partnership with Caesars. The terms of the collaboration saw Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino elevate the experience for its customers. At the time, Aristocrat confirmed that Caesars will benefit from leading online gaming experiences provided by Anaxi.</p>
