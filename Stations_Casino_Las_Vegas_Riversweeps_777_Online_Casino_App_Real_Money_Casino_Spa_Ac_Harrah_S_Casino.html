<p>GGPoker, the world’s biggest poker room, has received a license to offer online gambling in Germany. The State Administration Office of Saxony-Anhalt, a regulator which currently provides licenses to operators, allowed the NSUS-owned company to operate poker for the next five years.</p>
<p>GGPoker Receives a German License</p>
<p>While Germany is known for its strict rules, it remains one of the biggest betting markets in Europe, making it an attractive jurisdiction for many gambling companies. GGPoker, which has offered online poker and iGaming for the last five years, wants to tap into this promising market and engage local customers with exciting poker games and tournaments. Users of the poker room can participate in games such as Rush &amp; Catch poker, All-In or Fold, Flip &amp; Go, Spin &amp; Gold, Battle Royale, GGCare &amp; GGCheers and many others.</p>
<p>GGPoker has cemented itself as the leading poker room thanks to its commitment to poker and its connections to the world stage of poker. For example, GGPoker is the official sponsor of the World Series of Poker Las Vegas, thanks to which it can offer pro players tons of growth opportunities. GGPoker also hosted the main WSOP online event and the WSOP 2020 Main Event two years ago.</p>
<p>GGPoker Is Excited to Modernize German iGaming</p>
<p>As reported by the gambling news outlet Gambling Insider, Sven Stiel from NSUS Germany praised the German authorities for their constructive approach, saying that his team is delighted to work with them. Stiel is excited about engaging German customers with poker offerings that are both innovative and of great quality while being secure and offering great customer protections. Thanks to the license, GGPoker’s content will also be legally backed, allowing customers to feel secure when playing with the company. Stiel concluded that this is a “decisive step” in modernizing Germany’s iGaming market.</p>
<p>GGPoker continues to steadily expand its presence in the digital poker space. At the beginning of October, the poker room joined forces with its longtime partner WSOP to launch WSOP.ca in Ontario, Canada. Thanks to this, customers in the Canadian province can now play a variety of competitive and recreational poker formats. To make things easier for existing players, GGPoker allowed customers to seamlessly transfer their existing accounts to the Canada-oriented platform.</p>
<p>A month earlier, Yggdrasil, one of the biggest iGaming content developers, teamed up with GGPoker, agreeing to power the poker room with its full range of games. This demonstrated GGPoker’s willingness to go beyond poker and engage customers with a varied selection of offerings.</p>
