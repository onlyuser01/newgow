<p>The 2022 MLS playoff race is heating up, with less than two months left before the end of the regular season. There are only nine more MLS games left for Inter Miami to play, a team thatâ€™s just below the playoff zone in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Toronto FCâ€™s job looks even harder as these guys have only eight more games to play before the end of the round-robin portion of the 2022 MLS season.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, you can be certain that both teams are going to give all they got in the remainder of the regular season. Therefore, we have every right to expect a real spectacle in Saturdayâ€™s Inter Miami vs Toronto FC game.</p>

<p>8:00 PM ET Place: Inter Miami CF Stadium in Miami, Florida</p>
<p>Inter Miami Want to Keep the Good Run Going</p>
<p>David Beckham-owned club is currently eight in the Eastern Conference with 33 points after 25 MLS games. They have the same number of points as seventh-placed Orlando City but are lower than them due to inferior score differential.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thereâ€™s still enough time for Inter Miami to get to the playoff zone. Judging by how well these guys have been playing lately, it seems that they will make this dream come true. Inter Miami are without a loss in the previous four MLS games, winning 50% of those.</p>
<p>Their most recent game saw them put on a vintage performance against reigning MLS champions, New York City FC. The final score was 3-2, with Miamiâ€™s striker Alejandro Pozuelo being the man of the match with two goals to his name.</p>

<p>The win earned Miami three points, but even more importantly, it gave their players a massive confidence boost ahead of the Toronto FC clash. Pozuelo is expected to have a good game again, as he knows all the strengths and weaknesses of Miamiâ€™s next opponent. Itâ€™s because he used to play for Toronto FC for three years before moving to Florida some six weeks ago.</p>
<p>Toronto FCâ€™s Ambitions Keep Growing</p>
<p>Similarly to Inter Miami, Toronto FC players have also been in top shape over the last couple of weeks. The Reds are without a loss in the MLS in the previous five rounds, winning three of those matches. Theyâ€™ve been brilliant scoring-wise, with a total of nine goals in the last three games.</p>
<p>No surprise there as they now got a lot of heavy weapons in the attacking department. This summer, they signed two Italian forwards â€“ Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi â€“ who have been nothing short of brilliant since the start of their MLS campaign.</p>
<p>Each player has played five games so far, with Bernardeschi scoring four MLS goals already. Insigne has scored two goals fewer, but heâ€™s been fantastic in other aspects of the game, especially passing and dribbling.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs Toronto FC Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams look very strong in the offense, while their defensive stats arenâ€™t that great. In fact, the Achillesâ€™ heel of both Inter Miami and Toronto FC seems to be the defense. That said, weâ€™re certain Saturdayâ€™s game will see plenty of goals. But, who will score more? We think neither team. Instead, we predict the game is going to be a high-scoring draw.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Miami and Toronto FC to draw; Over 3.5 goals</p>
