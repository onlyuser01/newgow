    <h1>Hard Rock Online Casino Oxford Casino Oxford Maine Durango Casino And Resort Hinckley Casino Club Pl</h1>

<p>Popular iGaming content supplier Betsoft Gaming has announced it has signed a new deal with multiple award-winning online casino brand 888. The agreement is aimed at the Romanian iGaming market. The casino that launched in 1997 will be hosting some of Betsoft’s most beloved slots.</p>
<p>What Can Romanian Players Expect?</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming will bring award-winning slots like Take the Bank, Book of Darkness, Stacked, and Primal Hunt into the Romanian market via the 888casino platform. Newcomers on the 888 platform will also be eligible for receiving excellent welcome bonuses while benefiting from the Player Points that the 888 Club provides to loyal casino members. 888casino Player Points can be exchanged for attractive prizes.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new agreement will help Betsoft gaming keep strengthening its foothold in regulated iGaming markets on the Old Continent. Romania will be joining Spain, Sweden, and Italy, other countries where Betsoft games are already up and running live. Betsoft has been a constant presence in the lives of Romanian casino players since its launch in 2016 when it was given the green light and a license to operate from the National Gambling Office of Romania. Ever since, players have been able to benefit from a one-of-a-kind, fully-localized, and customized experience via RON, the Romanian currency.</p>
<p>Why Is Romania a Good Market for Betsoft?</p>
<p>The country’s population goes over 19 million and enjoys one of the fastest internet speeds on the planet. Romania also has a long and well-established casino industry in place. All these ingredients turn the Eastern European country into a powerful magnet for online gaming.</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming’s head of account management Anastasia Bauer expressed the company’s delight regarding the “smooth integration” of their “award-winning games across the 888 sites.” Bauer also called Romania “an exciting growth market for us and one where we are already well-known,” adding that Betsoft was eager to witness its “very successful launch” with the 888casino platform.</p>
<p>888’s vice-president of Business-to-Consumer Talya Benyamini expressed similar feelings of delight and excitement in preparation for “hosting Betsoft’s dynamic and high-quality content titles” for their players in Romania. Benyamini added that 888’s localized releases would help them improve their “selection of innovative and exciting games,” with plans to keep sealing fresh content distribution deals across their European sites.</p>
<p>In July, 888casino and EveryMatrix signed a similar content deal that would allow the operator to expand its presence in the US and beyond. During the same month, Betsoft Gaming signed a partnership with PepperMill Casino that would enable it to strengthen its foothold in Belgium.</p>
