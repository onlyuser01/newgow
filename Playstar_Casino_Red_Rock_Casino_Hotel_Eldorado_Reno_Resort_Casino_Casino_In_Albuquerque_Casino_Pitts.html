The three casinos generated roughly $27.2 million in tax revenue in October, $15.5 million of which is Encore Boston Harbor’s taxes due to the state. MGM Springfield contributed $5.7million and Plainridge Park Casino contributed$6million.</p>
<p>Until now, the Commonwealth has collected roughly $1.235 billion in taxes and assessments from Plainridge Park Casino, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor since the openings of each gaming center. Plainridge Park Casino, which is a category 2 slots facility, pays 49% in taxes of its GGR. 82% of the collected taxes are allocated to Local Aid and the remaining 18% are paid to the Race Horse Development Fund.</p>

<p>Speaking about Future Results</p>
<p>The final trimester of the year is expected to bring significant profits and revenues for the three casinos, especially December, which is considered always a great month for MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor. As for Plainridge Park Casino, its figures usually drop around holidays, but this would not have a significant impact on the total figures of the three casinos since Plainridge Park Casino generates between $11 million to $12 million in monthly GGR.</p>
