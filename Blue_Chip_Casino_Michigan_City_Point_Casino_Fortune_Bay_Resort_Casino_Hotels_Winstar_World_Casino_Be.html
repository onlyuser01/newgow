    <h1>Blue Chip Casino Michigan City Point Casino Fortune Bay Resort Casino Hotels Winstar World Casino Be</h1>

<p>I made an account at this casino, where I could deposit money to the account without any problem and enjoy the games available on their website and application. When I wanted to withdraw money from the account I had to complete a form from which the information had to be verified and there was a maximum period of 48 hours. where at the end they would give me the money that I wanted to withdraw. At the time of completing this period I want to enter the page to play and see the status of the withdrawal of the money, where I find the surprise that my account was blocked. When trying to contact me by phone, I was answered by a person who only speaks English who only knows how to say in Spanish "consultations in Spanish by live chat", when asking about the blocking of my account in live chat, they told me that "it was blocked for violating part of the terms and conditions of the casino where supposedly I missed completing part of the form or there was some false information ". All the information that I filled out was true, so ask what was the supposed information that I did not fill in or the supposedly false information that caused the blocking of my account? thus correct it and not lose my account and the money that was in it or simply make another account and not make the same mistake, the answer to this question from the casino was: "unfortunately there is no access to this data and the relevant department I have already made a decision and cannot recover his account or make another "ending the live chat and giving me the option to send me the record of the conversation, which has not yet reached me. IN CONCLUSION THERE WAS NO SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM, NEITHER WAS THE REASON FOR THE BLOCKING OF MY ACCOUNT SPECIFYING TO ME AND I LOST THE MONEY THAT REMAINED IN THIS, AND I NEVER ASKED TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING IN THE GAMES ON THE PAGE</p>
