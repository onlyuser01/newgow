<p>Live betting supplier Sports Information Services has partnered with Oddin.gg, marking an important milestone in its e-sports betting offerings for Competitive Gaming. The new partnership will help launch a nonstop Counter-Strike betting product.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg to Supply the Full Package</p>
<p>The leading supplier of e-sports betting services will provide its trading assistance, pricing functionalities, betting odds, and end-to-end live video streaming solutions to SIS’s new Counter- Strike product. The offer will also include plenty of sports commentary and state-of-the-art on-screen betting data and triggers that will help passionate e-sports fans make the best decisions during live streams.</p>
<p>Together, these elements will support the launch of 24/7 Counter-Strike betting events that will show live 2v2 battles between talented Counter-Strike gamers all over the world. The betting events will be created by SIS’ in-house team in Manchester, UK.</p>
<p>They will be video streamed on a daily basis, generating a grand total of more than 44,000 CS:GO events by the end of the year. The supplier that unveiled a subsidiary in the United States last October will be responsible for closely observing and assessing each CS:GO contest in order to guarantee high levels of competition, top quality, and full integrity.</p>
<p>The 24/7 CS:GO Betting Product Rises the Number of Yearly SIS Events to 150,000</p>
<p>The new live streaming betting is crucial for SIS’ current Competitive Gaming offerings so far comprised of e-basketball and e-soccer. Both verticals proved their importance as content verticals for sports bettors and operators across the planet. The new product will carry the number of SIS events over the impressive 150,000 mark. At the same time, the product will attract a new type of audience passionate about 2×2 CS:GO contests, and eventually create a new generation of sports bettors.</p>
<p>SIS’ product director Conleth Byrne expressed the company’s delight to be adding their 24/7 CS:GO product to their already successful portfolio for Competitive Gaming. Byrne thinks the decision will help them build on the momentum they are currently enjoying with their other two verticals.</p>
<p>CS:GO is currently the most popular option for e-sports betting thanks to the lightning-fast action and rich plethora of betting options. This means the 2v2 vertical has found the perfect recipe to become a new hit. The decision to team up with Oddin.gg’s highly innovative and skilled team for pricing and trading solutions is also expected to generate remarkable results.</p>
<p>Global operators will be given the opportunity to engage with brand new segments of bettors with this first-class product.Oddin.gg’s co-founder and managing director for partnerships Marek Suchar also acknowledged the fact that no other provider is currently capable of offering regular live streams of competitive CS:GO events. At the beginning of March, SIS strengthened its management team by appointing Julian Wheeler as chief technology officer just in time for their continuous expansion.</p>
