<p>Swintt, a respected provider of online games, has further extended its reach through Guts Casino, an operator of casino products certified by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). By extension, Swintt will now have access to more MGA-regulated markets that recognize Guts Casino as a legitimate operator in their territory.</p>
<p>Guts Casino will in turn gain access to the full portfolio of titles available as part of the SwinttGames and SwinttPremium catalogue, featuring unique and worthwhile titles such as Extra Win X, Book of Shai and many more.</p>
<p>Guts Casino is also in a very strong position to conquer new markets as it’s part of the Betsson Group and has a proven track record in delivering exceptional products to the market that strike home with players. Part of this is achieved through the delivery of tier-one slots and games that have been carefully curated based on years of experience and following customer and business trends, but another part has to do with the targeted approach that the casino demonstrates in breaking ground in new territories and expanding its reach in existing ones.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Guts Casino Gaming Operations Manager Laszlo Hornyak welcomed the chance to consolidate the brand’s presence in MGA markets through the addition of more acclaimed titles.</p>
<p>"In Swintt, we have found a provider that can add a diverse range of titles to our constantly growing games lobby. Their portfolio provides our customers with plenty of choice, ensuring there is a little bit of something for everyone, which is something we pride ourselves on at Guts Casino," Hornyak explained.</p>
<p>Swintt CEO David Mann was similarly excited about the opportunity to expand the supplier’s reach in MGA territories and licensed jurisdictions and confirmed that Guts Casino has not been a chance picking, but a carefully researched choice.</p>
<p>"Guts is a hugely respected operator that we are proud to add to our ever-growing portfolio of partners. By working with them, we will be given a chance to showcase all of our products to a new audience," Mann added.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Swintt has been striking a number of successful and individual partnerships, expanding its reach through some of the industry’s best-established brands and names. Among the list of partnerships is a deal with Uniclub in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The operator also teamed up with Rizk Casino, a well-established brand scoring very high on Casino Guru’s Safety Index. Not least, Swintt’s products have also made it as part of Circus.nl’s offer.</p>
