<p>Esports are big in the Balkans, and Oddin.gg seems to know as much. The company, which specializes in the provision of esports betting feeds and odds, has signed a new partnership with MaxBet, a prominent regional brand, which will enable Oddin.gg to break ground into the coveted geography where millions of esports fans live.</p>
<p>The company, which also provides risk management and iFrame solutions, has hailed its success in establishing a relationship with MaxBet as Oddin.gg expects to further boost its pace of geographic expansion over the coming months. Maxbet will benefit from the company’s solutions, and its iFrame solution in particular, across regional markets in Montenegro, The Republic of Srpska, and Serbia.</p>
<p>MaxBet and Oddin.gg stand to benefit from what is a mutually beneficial and meaningful relationship. For one, MaxBet is a prominent local name and brand that will be able to appeal to local audiences. For its part, Oddin.gg is a company that specializes in the delivery of esports products exclusively.</p>
<p>This means that Oddin.gg’s products are tailored to appeal to the right target audiences. MaxBet CEO Darko Živanov was thrilled by the opportunity presented to his company and hailed the collaboration with Oddin.gg as a significant way to improve the company’s overall offer.</p>
<p>It’s a logical step for the operator, Živanov explained. Esports as a whole is a high-potential vertical that MaxBet has long kept an eye out for. "We wanted to offer our users the absolute best in the industry, and that is why we chose Oddin.gg," he assured.</p>
<p>The news was understandably hailed as a watershed moment for Oddin.gg and not least, by the company’s Co-Founder and Managing Director, Marek Suchar. Suchar said that MaxBet was indeed a prominent brand in the Balkans, and an opportunity for Oddin to gain a firm foothold in the region.</p>
<p>He added that his company was constantly on the lookout to establish its presence in new markets and bring the iFrame solution portfolio to fresh operators and customers. Despite the company only now dipping a toe in the Balkan esports scene, Suchar and Oddin.gg are confident in the future success of the partnership with MaxBet.</p>
<p>Oddin.gg has signed a partnership with a range of operators, including Betway, SIS, and PLAYZone.</p>
