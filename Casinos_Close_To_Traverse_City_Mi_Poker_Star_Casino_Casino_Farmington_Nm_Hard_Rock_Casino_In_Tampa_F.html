<p>Indigo Sky emphasized that no customer banking data or other financial information has been acquired by the violators</p>
<p>Two of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma’s properties, namely the Indigo Sky Casino and Resort and Outpost Casino, have experienced data security incidents in December. In relation to that, the two gambling venues are now notifying customers whose personal data might have been compromised.</p>
<p>The issue was first discovered by Indigo Sky, which discovered unusual activity on its network and immediately launched an investigation into the matter. After it understood that data may have been compromised, the property initiated steps to protect its systems.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Indigo Sky contacted law enforcement and employed the services of a forensic security company. As a result, the company understood that a third party had indeed breached its systems and had accessed some documents.</p>
<p>The Shawnee property explained that the documents in question might have contained sensitive data, such as employees’ personal information, as well as the personal data of some of the casino’s customers. Indigo Sky specified that the compromised data may have included the names, social security numbers and driver’s license numbers of the affected individuals.</p>
<p>However, Indigo Sky emphasized that no customer banking data or other financial information has been acquired by the third party.</p>
<p>Indigo Sky Advised Affected Individuals to Protect Their Identities</p>
<p>Yesterday, Indigo Sky contacted individuals whose data might have been compromised via mail, offering them complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to make up for the incident. Indigo Sky customers and affected workers should refer to the emails for further information or contact Indigo Sky via phone.</p>
<p>Indigo Sky elaborated on the matter, saying that its patrons should “remain vigilant” and be wary of potential fraud and/or identity theft. For starters, the property suggested that its customers should review their account statements and monitor credit reports closely.</p>
<p>If customers detect any suspicious activity, they should contact the financial institution or company with which the account is maintained, Indigo Sky suggested. The property also urged clients to refer to law enforcement authorities.</p>
