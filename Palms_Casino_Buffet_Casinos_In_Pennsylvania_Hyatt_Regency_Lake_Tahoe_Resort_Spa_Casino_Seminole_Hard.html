    <h1>Palms Casino Buffet Casinos In Pennsylvania Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa Casino Seminole Hard</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>This is completely absurd that i am unable to verify my identity, these people have contacted me on gmail and then from there told me to contact on a sone random whatsapp no. thats not even mentioned on the website, and then told me that if i will take my complaint back from casino guru, they will verify my kyc and let me withdraw my money from it. I told them that i will close my complaint once the kyc is done, but they kept insisting and saying that u need to take the complaint back first. But as soon as. i have posted the reply yesterday to take my complaint back, they have captured all my winnings and i was left only with my deposited amount. I am sorry to say ,but these are no way near to being any good rated online casino. They do not reply to any of users query , have not verified my kyc for about one month now, and there customer support executive says there is no certain time for kyc verification, so it may take take years, users are just supposed to wait patiently. I am sure casino guru , that if i have not filed the complaint, they would not have contact me.And when they did , they told me to contact on a whatsapp no. that is not even mentioned on their website. I have made 3 call back requests prior to filing the complaint, but no response to that as well.And i am tired of sending them emails and begging them to withdraw my own money , and now they are playing these cheap tactics to contact me through random numbers and asking me to take the complaint back and once i did they captured my winning amount. I have not even played for so long in their website, what is their possible explanation for capturing my winning amount. They have a simple policy, as long as the player is loosing its good, you need no documents, no kyc verification, once he starts winning, do not verify the users kyc for months or years or decades maybe ,as their customer care executive says that there is no certain time. If user files a complaint against them , they contact them imediately and asks him to take the complaint back, and once he does they capture their winnings and finally blocks their account like they have blocked mine.</p>
<p>Dear casino guru, im tired of their tactics and they have litterally made me cry for my money, thats rajabets exclusive experience for their customer. Please help me get my money back and after that they can surely block my account because i also dont want to play on this fraud website either.</p>
