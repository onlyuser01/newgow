<p>When and Where Charlo vs. Castano Taking Place</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, July 17</p>
<p>: Saturday, July 17 Time : 9:00 pm EST</p>
<p>: 9:00 pm EST Venue: AT&amp;T Center, San Antonio, Texas</p>
<p>The fight between Charlo and Castano will take place on Charlo’s home turf this Saturday, July 17. The event begins at 9:00 pm EST at the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Charlo’s Profile Puts Him as a Favorite</p>
<p>The odds seem to favor Charlo by a long margin, which is understandable. The fighter has been on an unstoppable upward trajectory, having reigned as the undisputed champion in the WBC, WBA and the IBF super welterweight categories with little competition in sight.</p>
<p>Charlo has secured 35 wins in his career, with only a single loss to his name. His only loss was to Tony Harrison via unanimous decision. A total of 18 wins have been achieved by KO, which is above average for his division, making him an even more dangerous opponent.</p>
<p>There is also the home arena advantage. Charlo, who hails from Texas, will be playing on his home turf, giving him an additional incentive to prove himself once again.</p>
<p>What to Expect from Castano</p>
<p>Castano is walking in the cage against a fighter whose nickname is “Iron Man,” revealing a lot about his opponent. Yet, Castano has an amazing track record behind him, even though he is only halfway through what Charlo has to offer.</p>
<p>Castano has fought 17 times so far, and 12 times he secured a victory KO, with another four brought in by decision and one by disqualification. Overall, his track record is a spotless 17-0-0, making him a very serious contender for the title.</p>
<p>Now, you may argue that Castano had it easy so far, but his track record is actually pretty impressive. The fighter is going up against some noteworthy opponents, including Patrick Teixeira (31-1-0), Cedric Vitu (46-2-0) and Michel Soro (30-1-1).</p>
<p>The odds favored Castano’s opponents in each of these fights, but he ended up the reason why two of these have a single loss in their career stats.</p>
<p>Charlo vs. Castano Tale of the Tape</p>
<p>Jermell Charlo VS Brian Castano 34-1 Record 17-0-1 18 KOs 12 5’11 Height 5’7.5 73″ Reach 67.5″ Orthodox Stance Orthodox</p>
<p>Both fighters seem to be fairly even in terms of overall physical prowess, and the fight is bound to go the distance. The only sudden upset that could potentially happen is Charlo throwing a powerful punch that knocks Castano out.</p>
<p>However, from what we have seen, Castano is hardly one to succumb easily under pressure, and the fight will promise a lot of spectacular moments this weekend.</p>
