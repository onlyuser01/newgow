    <h1>Hard Rock Online Casino Isle Casino Hotel Waterloo Horseshoe Casino In Baltimore Redstag Casino Casi</h1>

<p>I had four withdrawals pending to the value of Â£9,000. I found my account was then restricted. I asked live support if restrictions would effect my withdrawals. Live support decided I had a gambling problem and proceeded to put me on a 12 month self exclusion. So then I was left without access to my account and withdrawals pending. I duely sent all the documents required via email as requested to show how I was funding my account. I proceeded to send them ten more times over a period of ten weeks. Of course customer support were very polite in their emails saying "we have escalated your complaint and prioritised it". That's basically all they said.</p>
<p>I did my research and found they had breached their own terms and conditions by holding onto withdrawals for an unreasonable time without reason and that of their licensing regulations. I reminded them of this constantly and gave them deadlines to resolve this internally before I took it to the ADR they use and the Gambling Commission and then to court if I had to. I was very polite during all of this but inside I was angry and upset. My knowledge and patience paid off as I got an email yesterday saying my withdrawals had been approved. Stick to your guns, don't give in, know your rights and give them deadlines to respond or to get it rectified. It worked for me and hope it works for you if you have the same problem.</p>
