<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has revealed the latest results for the gambling industry in the Keystone State. In the official report shared on the regulator’s website, the PGCB noted that the industry generated $456,838,518 in February 2023, up 21.60% on February 2022.</p>
<p>The strong results are owing to a rebound in sports gambling and online casino, as well as a strong retail sector, with the industry in the Keystone State showing strong signs of growth and success. The PGCB also took into consideration revenue from slot machines, internet gaming, sports wagering, fantasy contests, VGTs, table games, and more.</p>
<p>The regulator has offered its customary revenue breakdown by segment and property, spotting interesting trends once again. Some companies posted close to 100% gain or even exceeded these numbers in February 2023.

<p>The second most-grossing property was not surprisingly the Valley Forge Casino Resort. Parx Casino came in third with only a nominal gain in revenue on annual basis. The property posted $54.508,417 in February 2023 and $53,587,153 in February 2022, posting only a nominal gain. Rivers Casino Philadelphia stood at $47,459,589 in total revenue, gaining 16.81% on February 2022’s $40.629,369.</p>

The sports wagering revenue stood at $43,230,177 in February 2023 compared to -$442,847 in February 2022. Retail slots revenue was $202,822,213, a 4.18% gain against February 2022’s $194,692,492.</p>
<p>Then again, iGaming slot revenue reached $92,830,999, up 36%.27% on February’s $68,120,783.
