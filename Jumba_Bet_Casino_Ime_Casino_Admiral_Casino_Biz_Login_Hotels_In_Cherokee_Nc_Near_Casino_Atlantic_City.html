    <h1>Jumba Bet Casino Ime Casino Admiral Casino Biz Login Hotels In Cherokee Nc Near Casino Atlantic City</h1>

<p>I have been playing at this casino the last couple weeks. I have deposited through bitcoin over 10 times without any issue, depositing several thousand dollars. I finally had a large win &gt;$30,000 and was very excited. I instantly made a withdrawal request and was very surprised when it hit my crypto account within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I then decided to make another withdrawal of $5000 to which it was declined without any reason. I tried a few more times and they kept on being declined. I contacted support and then was told to email security@helabet.com the front and back of my ID and it will take upto 48 hours to process.</p>
<p>After waiting 2 days i contacted security@helabet.com again and they emailed me saying I need to take a photograph with me holding my ID and also holding the exact email they are sending all in the same picture with all writing visible. This is extremely difficult, but after several attempts they said my account it processed and I can now withdrawal.</p>
<p>I made a withdrawal for $5000 AUD and it was accepted within 15 minutes. Then after a day I emailed security@helabet.com and they replied saying the withdrawal was processed and wait for it to hit my account. After waiting another day I emailed them back and they replied saying there's technical issues and I need to make another deposit. I made another deposit and then emailed back and they keep replying with the same email.</p>
<p>Then after another day I email them and they reply saying the withdrawal is processed please wait until it hits my account. Then the next email they say due to technical issues please make another deposit. This keeps going around. It's definitely some sort of scam!</p>
<p>Customer support on Chat takes an hour to reply and then says to email them.</p>
