<p>White Hat Gaming has continued to growth its presence in the regulated iGaming market in the United States through another expansion of its existing alliance with Bally’s</p>
<p>Moving forward, the company will offer its product with Bally’s in New York, making it the sixth deployment with the corporation in several months, and following the success of similar rollouts in Colorado, Virginia, Arizona, Indiana, and Ohio.</p>

<p>The PAM solution is designed to help support Bally’s sportsbook operations and drive results across the board. As sports betting becomes an increasingly competitive vertical, companies such as Bally’s have been actively looking to underpin their sportsbooks and offers with software that they can trust and rely on.</p>
<p>White Hat brings an array of helpful tools and functionalities to achieve this goal, including the Traveling Wallet, which allows Bally’s customers to access their account balance, loyalty offers, and bonuses across state lines for a better, streamlined, and integrated experience.</p>
<p>The CRM and PAM services included in the partnership come with a proprietary cashier, a variety of payment methods, round-the-clock support, player protection tools and so much more. This is not the last place where Bally’s and White Hat Gaming will be collaborating either, as the pair plans on more expansion moves together.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fresh opportunity, Bally’s CEO Robeson Reeves welcomed the chance to see White Hat Gaming deploy its platform for the corporation in yet another jurisdiction. He added:</p>
<p>They have accelerated our growth strategy as we look to strengthen our online footprint alongside the existing retail presence we hold.</p>
<p>Reeves confirmed that there will be more launches coming in the weeks ahead, outlining a busy schedule for Bally’s as the company doesn’t seem to let up its expansion pace in the regulated gambling sector.</p>

<p>White Hat Gaming CEO Phil Gelvan was similarly pleased to have been able to launch the company’s PAM solutions with Bally’s in six states in the span of only three months.</p>
<p>“It speaks volumes about our ability to move fast in this industry and provide operators with the tech stack required to launch quickly and smoothly,” Gelvan added.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming was also recently authorized and deployed its PAM solution in Maryland, as one of the growing number of states where the company can operate.</p>
