<p>FSB, a global business-to-business sports betting and iGaming supplier announced a new deal with Abelson Info, a London-based sports data and odds specialist.</p>
<p>Abelson Info and FSB Join Forces</p>
<p>On Thursday, FSB revealed that through its latest deal with Abelson Info, it will significantly enhance its leading soccer product. Under the terms of the new deal, Abelson Info’s Goalscorer Pricing and Settlement (GPS) service will be added to FSB’s product. The company explained that thanks to this partnership, it will introduce “goalscorer markets service with goalscorer derivatives” for different global competitions. At the same time, the functionality will be available for major soccer leagues in Europe.</p>
<p>The new deal comes at the perfect time, considering the upcoming start of the World Cup. With that in mind, FSB will leverage the GPS markets functionality and integrate it into its “Create a Bet” Bet Builder model. The company predicts the integration to be completed just in time for the World Cup start in Qatar next month.</p>
<p>FSB’s recent partnership with Abelson Info comes during an extremely busy period for the company. Only recently, FSB penned a multi-market European deal with Olympic Entertainment Group. In addition, the company expanded in North America, after it received a license in Nevada last month.</p>
<p>The New Deal Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Abelson’s COO, Jeevan Jeyaratnam, said about the recent deal that the company designed its GPS service to fit the needs of FSB. He deemed the collaboration as constructive and explained that the new solution will significantly enhance FSB’s offering. Jeyaratnam added that the GPS solution also opens possibilities for localization regardless of the jurisdiction where the operator plans to introduce its services. Last but not least he said: “We’re hugely confident our data and pricing solutions will add further weight to their football offering and enable them to attract further Tier 1 clients across their global regions.”</p>
<p>“The flexibility and breadth of the service will help ensure that FSB are offering a product that is not only superior to its peers, but also offers greater scope for localisation, no matter which jurisdiction the operator is targeting.“ Jeevan Jeyaratnam, COO at Abelson Info</p>
<p>Mark Wilson, FSB’s trading director, added that offering supreme sportsbook experiences for the company’s partners is a strategic priority. He explained that the new deal with Abelson enables the company to provide more engaging services for its growing portfolio of clients. Finally, Wilson said: “Abelson Info has an outstanding reputation of offering dynamic data and pricing solutions to Tier 1 global stakeholders in our industry so this partnership made sense on a number of levels.”</p>
