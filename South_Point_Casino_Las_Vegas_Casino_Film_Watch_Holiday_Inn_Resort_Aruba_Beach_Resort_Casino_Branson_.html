<p>State Fair Board in Nebraska Supports Games of Chance</p>
<p>The State Fair Board’s monthly meeting in Nebraska took place on Saturday this week. Following the meeting, as announced by KSNB, the Board revealed that it supports the proposal of the state legislature allowing games of chance to take place at the fair. Currently, state law is in effect which prohibits any games of chance to take place near the fair.</p>
<p>However, this may soon change thanks to Senator Ray Aguilar’s bill proposal. Although the State Fair’s Board expressed support for the games of chance, it’s up to the state’s lawmakers to make the final decision.</p>
<p>Hosted at Fonner Park in Grand Island, Nebraska, the state fair is an annual 11-day event. The fair starts at the end of August and runs through early September ending on Labor Day. The unique event showcases people and products from the state, features a trade show, livestock exhibition, and many more fun events.</p>
<p>Fonner Park Announces Plans for a Casino Venue</p>
<p>Besides Nebraska’s State Fair, Fonner Park is also a home to live horse racing with year-round events. Considering that on the November’s ballot, Nebraska voters approved casino gambling at state-licensed horse racing tracks in Grand Island, Lincoln, Omaha, Columbus, and South Sioux City, on Monday this week, Fonner Park revealed its plans to establish a casino.</p>
<p>In a statement, Chris Kotulak, Fonner Park CEO revealed that he is eager to establish a casino venue that would bring tax benefits, boost tourism and create more workplaces at Fonner Park. He outlined that Fonner Park has been discussing the matter with casino operators since October and by now it’s down to nine potential casino operators.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Mr. Kotulak stressed that before proceeding, Fonner Park would have to wait until the State Gaming Commission establishes the rules and regulations. Acknowledging that he cannot predict when the regulations will be set, in conclusion, Mr. Kotulak said that the opening day at Fonner Park is on February 19 and all visitors would need to wear a mask.</p>
