<p>Pragmatic Play has introduced a series of new iGaming tables to its live casino portfolio with new titles across Baccarat, Speed Baccarat, and Blackjack, which will allow partner operators to scale up the size of the offered product. This translates into 15 new tables that are now available through Pragmatic play’s Ruby studio for blackjack alone.</p>
<p>More Tables, Scalable Solutions and Great Quality</p>
<p>Pragmatic has created the Ruby studio in a way that suggests exclusiveness and luxuriousness that players can revel in at their own time and choose from established and play-tested versions of blackjack. This means that players will have even more tables to connect to when looking for Perfect Pairs and 21+3 Blackjack on top of the classic versions.</p>
<p>The Bet Behind options ensures that players are always playing with someone else on the table and the Early Decisions feature enables players to cut the wait time while still enjoying more hands per hour and the same good quality of the picture.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely welcomed the addition of the new products and expansion of the supported tables:</p>
<p>“The new tables offer a fast-paced experience similar to the immersive nature of traditional casinos, and they will help maintain our drive to provide the best in Live Casino to as diverse a player demographic as possible.” Pragmatic Play chief business development officer Yossi Barzely</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also extending its support for Speed Baccarat with two new tables that are once again focused on a quicker and more rewarding experience leading to constant engagement.</p>
<p>Baccarat and Blackjack Build Up</p>
<p>Each round of Speed Baccarat lasts 27 seconds and players have only 12 seconds to make their bets, which adds a bit of pressure but moves the action along to the satisfaction of players who prefer this.</p>
<p>Players may choose between a Regular and No-Commission Mode at their leisure or check the Super 6 side bet.</p>
<p>Both Baccarat and Speed Baccarat tables are available starting today. The Baccarat products also benefit from the company’s proprietary technology called Chroma Solutions which allows it to deliver on a better overall live casino experience.</p>
<p>Thanks to these additions, the number of supported tables by Pragmatic Play has increased to more than 200. All are optimized on HTML5 and shot in 4K to ensure that no quality of the detail is lost on the players. Earlier this year, Pragmatic Play confirmed that it’s expanding its award-winning engagement and promotional solution Drops &amp; Wins with $1.14 million in monthly awards divvied up between players.</p>
