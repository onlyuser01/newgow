<p>The award-winning developer of games for the online gambling sector, Evoplay, continues to expand its portfolio of offering. On Monday this week, the company confirmed the release of its latest game called Video Poker. Evoplay's latest new title offers a modern twist to the retro game Jacks or Better. In the game, any hand that is equal or higher than a pair of jacks can secure a prize.</p>
<p>Players of Video Poker can expect quality graphics and animations with the cards presented at the center of the screen and a chart with the payouts on the left side. Relaxing background music elevates the excitement and matches the gameplay of the new game. Ultimately, players of the new game can secure a prize between x1 and x250, depending on their winning combination. Evoplay's new table game supports nearly two dozen languages, a statement reveals. The game's max win is capped at €93,750 and it also features an RTP of up to 95.79%.</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay's CEO, was excited about the recently released table game. "Reminiscent of a vintage casino experience, Video Poker combines the classic allure of Jacks or Better with the excitement of multiple hands and multipliers as well as the Auto Hold mode further amplifying the dynamism to the gameplay," he explained. Finally, Kravchuk pointed out: "Enhancing player-favorite experiences with Evoplay’s modern twist, we continue to demonstrate our mission to provide unique experiences across all iGaming sectors."</p>
<p>In Evoplay's Video Poker, players can play up to 5 hands at the same time. According to the iGaming content developer, the more hands are active, the higher the chance of securing a winning combination is.</p>
<p>The new game also offers an Auto Hold mode. When activated, winning card combinations are automatically held after dealing. To elevate the excitement further, Evoplay's new table game allows Autoplay to be activated along with Auto Hold.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Evoplay confirmed it signed an agreement with BetFlag, a leading sportsbook and iGaming operator in Italy. Per the terms of that agreement, the award-winning game development studio agreed to supply its games, expanding the offering of the operator in the country.</p>
<p>This partnership represented a major achievement for Evoplay as it significantly propelled its presence in Italy, one of the most important markets on the Old Continent. Through the partnership with BetFlag, the iGaming supplier was able to reach new audiences, delivering thrilling games that offer unique experiences along with engaging and rewarding mechanics.</p>
