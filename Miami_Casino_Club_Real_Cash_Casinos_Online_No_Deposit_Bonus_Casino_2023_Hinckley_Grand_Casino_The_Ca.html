    <h1>Miami Casino Club Real Cash Casinos Online No Deposit Bonus Casino 2023 Hinckley Grand Casino The Ca</h1>

<p>Just in time for the holiday season, iGaming giant Playtech announced a split-second roll out of its gaming studios in New Jersey and Michigan on Friday. The company, which specializes in the creation of authentic live gaming experiences and has authored the highly acclaimed Age of the Gods live game roulette series, is expanding its technical capabilities with two new studios that can deliver content directly to US customers.</p>
<p>The brand is now live with bet365 in New Jersey and Parx Casino in Michigan and plans on further increasing its footprint in the iGaming space. The new studios are part of Playtech’s broader strategy to continue building up its footprint in the United States and rival directly with Evolution, its main competitor in the live gaming space.</p>
<p>US Becomes Battleground for iGaming Market Share</p>
<p>Playtech will seek further strategic expansions in the United States which should translate into better overall performance as well as market share. Playtech’s landmark studio openings have been well-planed, argues Playtech CEO of live casino Edo Haitin in a statement:</p>
<p>“This is a landmark moment for Playtech and our development in the U.S. and it is something we are all very excited about.” Playtech CEO of live casino Edo Haitin</p>
<p>With the company reaping the benefits of a strong B2B push across several continents, Playtech is well-poised to continue consolidating its footprint in the live gaming market. Haitin is confident that Playtech Live can provide consumers and partner businesses with engaging and innovative products and tech, catering to new audiences and entering new markets as it goes along.</p>
<p>Playtech has specifically targeted those two states as they represent some of the fastest-growing iGaming markets in the United States, putting Playtech in a good position to rival for further expansion and benefits in the live gaming vertical.</p>
<p>Playtech Undergoing Some Reorganization under Acquisition Bid</p>
<p>These recent launches come in the broader context of the most recent acquisition push by Aristocrat Leisure, an Australian slot machine maker, which is seeking to expand its clout in the digital gaming sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Playtech is preparing itself to expand as more states in the US become available for iGaming. While over 30 states are now offering legal sports betting in the United States, that is not the case when it comes to iGaming.</p>
<p>States such as Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, and West Virginia do, and they are rapidly becoming the focal point of competition from big iGaming suppliers.</p>
