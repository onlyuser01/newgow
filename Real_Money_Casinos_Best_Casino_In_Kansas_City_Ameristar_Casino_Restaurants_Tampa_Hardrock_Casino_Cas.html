<p>The man who robbed a woman at Las Vegas’ Dotty’s casino apparently targeted the winning player after she won about $30,000, a recently-released arrest report reveals. Samuel Schmid allegedly yanked her pocketbook and fled the gaming venue. Upon driving away, a manager was fatally injured by the suspect’s SUV.</p>

<p>It also appears a conspirator helped Schmid, 28, identify the player. Schmid is suspected of exchanging phone messages with the other man before the robbery, the Las Vegas Metro Police arrest report said.</p>
<p>That unidentified accomplice allegedly watched the player win several jackpots that day, according to KLAS, a local TV station.</p>
<p>On May 11, Schmid had driven to the casino in a stolen Mercedes-Benz SUV. The vehicle was left in a handicap spot in a shopping center parking lot while he went inside.</p>
<p>What Happened to Jackpot?</p>
<p>Schmid was only in the venue for a few minutes, and then went back to the SUV. Soon, he went back inside the gaming parlor. He committed the robbery before fleeing, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>Dotty’s manager Alicia Gibellina, 60, ran into the parking lot to prevent Schmid’s escape. He allegedly pulled out a firearm when she approached the vehicle.</p>
<p>She then moved behind the SUV. It suddenly backed up, and she was run over. She died an hour later from blunt force injuries, the Clark County coroner’s office ruled.</p>
<p>The winning player suffered non-life-threatening injuries during the robbery. She went to a local hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>It was unclear if Schmid stole all of her winnings based on police reports. Also, it is unclear if any of the money was recovered by police.</p>
<p>Suspect’s Cell Phone Discovered</p>
<p>Police later searched the crime scene for evidence. Officers located Schmid’s cell phone on the floor inside the casino. It apparently had fallen out of his pocket during the robbery.</p>
<p>A search of the phone revealed photos of Schmid. It also had texts of messages between Schmid and the second suspect.</p>
<p>It was suspected that some fingerprints found at the scene matched those of a suspect who was in custody at the Clark County Detention Center, KLAS said. It is unclear if that second suspect has yet to be charged for the Dotty’s robbery.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Schmid appeared in Las Vegas court for open murder, robbery, battery, and conspiracy charges. He remains in custody in the Clark County Detention Center. He has yet to enter a plea on his charges.</p>
<p>So far, no bail has been set in his case. His next court date is on June 2. He is being represented by the Clark County public defender’s office.</p>
<p>The incident took place at Flamingo Road and Jones Boulevard in the unincorporated community of Spring Valley, Nev. Dotty’s is a chain with locations in Nevada, Oregon, and Montana. They feature slot machines.</p>
