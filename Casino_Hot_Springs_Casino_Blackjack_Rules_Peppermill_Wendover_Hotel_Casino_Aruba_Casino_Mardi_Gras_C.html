    <h1>Casino Hot Springs Casino Blackjack Rules Peppermill Wendover Hotel Casino Aruba Casino Mardi Gras C</h1>

<p>As the United States is undergoing a rapid state of iGaming legalization, more custodians of the fairness of games, brands, and payouts are needed. One such is eCOGRA which has now expanded into a sixth state in the country, after securing a license with the Connecticut State Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) Gaming Division, the company revealed in an official statement.</p>
<p>This way the global number of jurisdictions where eCOGRA is authorized to provide its testing services has increased to 36, making it one of the de facto leaders in the online gambling industry worldwide. eCOGRA has been a torch-bearer in the industry, guiding and establishing overall operational standards and player safety requirements.</p>
<p>eCOGRA has been a benchmark company synonymous with integrity, excellence, and reliability over the past two decades and the firm intends to continue doing so over the next decades as well. The company is tasked with ensuring that individual brands in the online gambling industry achieve fair and transparent gaming practices and that both players and operators within the industry are protected.</p>
<p>eCOGRA CEO Shaun McCallaghan was pleased with the opportunity to see the company expand in yet another jurisdiction and offer its services first-hand. McCallaghan said:</p>
<p>"With our independent testing, inspection, and certification expertise, we aim to foster a transparent and secure online gambling ecosystem that benefits players, suppliers, and operators."</p>
<p>This expertise will now extend to the state of Connecticut as well, which is also fast adopting online casino gambling. Incidentally, Connecticut is also the sixth iGaming state in the country to authorize the arrival of online casino gambling in 2021, alongside New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and others. eCOGRA will be tasked with ensuring that local operators meet fairness and security standards and offer their players a reliable experience from start to finish.</p>
<p>The company runs extensive testing and evaluations, that include cybersecurity assessment, in-depth software testing of the Random Number Generator that determines payouts in online casinos, and overall compliance reviews. eCOGRA is fully committed to bolstering industry standards and making sure that regulatory requirements by clients are met completely, making the gambling industry safer in the process.</p>
<p>The news was also welcomed by eCOGRA CTO Bradley Khoury who said that the latest license approval was a testament to the companyâ€™s ongoing efforts to make the industry a safer place and improve standards for both companies and consumers. In the meantime, Connecticut has been adding new suppliers and brands to its iGaming sector.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix recently obtained a supplier license in the state as did White Hat Studios, another dedicated studio specializing in developing iGaming titles, and keen to expand its product lineup across the United States and North America.</p>
