    <h1>Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Ms Golden Dragon Casino Vegas Casino News Fitz Casino Casino Guitar Penns</h1>

<p>Judging by figures released by the gaming regulator in Pennsylvania, the gaming industry in the state has seen a record-breaking revenue last month.</p>
<p>Gambling Operators Set a New Record This March</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) released its latest report, revealing the gaming revenue reported by licensed operators for March. Without any doubt, last month was successful for the gaming industry, considering the $462.7 million in reported revenue. This result surpassed the $432.5 million revenue record that was set back in November 2021.</p>
<p>According to the regulator, the gaming revenue increase was mainly driven by two gambling sectors. Those are retail table games and internet casino-type gambling. The former’s revenue exceeded $90 million in March, while the latter’s revenue exceeded $110 million. Both activities marked a record last month. In March 2021, the total gaming revenue in Pennsylvania hit $403.1 million. A year-over-year comparison for the same period shows that this year, the revenue increased by nearly $60 million or 14.79%. On the other hand, taxes from all forms of gambling including fantasy contests hit $187.0 million in March, according to the regulator.</p>
<p>The PGCB Reveals a Breakdown of the Gaming Revenue</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $462.7 million in gambling revenue shows that retail slots revenue hit $214.7 million, up 7.74% from the $199.3 million reported in March 2021. Table games revenue last month hit $94.3 million, up 32.12% when compared to the $71.4 million in revenue from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The revenues for iGaming slots and table games showed a similar increase. Last month, iGaming slots revenue hit $79.2 million, up 19.23% from the $66.4 million in revenue during March 2021. On the other hand, iGaming tables revenue in March 2021 halted at $28.9 million. This year, in March, iGaming tables revenue hit $35.7 million, up 23.62%. Additionally, iGaming poker revenue increased significantly last month. Overall, in March, $3.2 million was reported in iGaming poker revenue, marking a 34.91% increase.</p>
<p>Similarly, sports wagering revenue increased as well. Last month, sportsbooks in Pennsylvania reported $30.4 million in revenue. This marks a 3.57% increase when compared to the $29.4 million in sports wagering revenue for the same period the prior year. The revenue for video gaming terminals (VGT) hit $3.8 million last month, up 5.16% from the $3.6 million reported in March last year.
