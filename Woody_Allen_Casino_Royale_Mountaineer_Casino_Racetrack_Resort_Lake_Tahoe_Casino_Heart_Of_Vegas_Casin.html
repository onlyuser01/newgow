<p>Relax Gaming, a leading iGaming developer, supplier of content and gaming aggregator, has signed a new partnership with Gran Madrid. As a result, Relax Gaming will deploy a range of tier-one products with Gran Madrid and have access to more than 30 award-winning games developed by the studio and third-party partners. Those games include excellent iGaming choices such as Beast Mode, Money Train 3, Temple Tumble, and others.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming and Gran Madrid Reach Content Deal in Spain</p>
<p>More games will be forthcoming once they have been cleared by the Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego, Spain’s national gambling regulator. To deploy the games, Relax and Gran Madrid have turned to Tecnails which is helping Relax make its games available in Spain and with leading operators in the country.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard welcomed the opportunity to see Relax Gaming expand further in the market. The country already has more than 50 operators and is an important part of the company’s growth strategy in Western Europe. Attard said:</p>
<p>After our first launch in the Spanish market with Entain in June, we’re delighted to see the momentum continuing with yet another big win.</p>
<p>Gran Madrid online country manager José Félix Herreros was equally pleased with the news and said that this new partnership will give the casino a significant brand and help it build its portfolio of high-quality games. Herreros said:</p>
<p>The alliance with Relax Gaming allows us to continue expanding our portfolio with a high-quality product that will help us to continue growing together. Gran Madrid online country manager José Félix Herreros</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has been a lot in the news recently. The company has been adding games at a good clip, with releases such as Dream Drop Diamonds, Templar Tumble 2, and Hot Rod Racers, among others. Relax Gaming is one of the most prominent suppliers in the industry. The company’s aggregation solution already features more than 4,000 online games, and it has won a number of awards from EGR and SBC.</p>
<p>The company is also firmly focused on expanding beyond Europe in the United States and Canada, as it sees those markets as a make-or-break opportunity for iGaming suppliers in the future.</p>
