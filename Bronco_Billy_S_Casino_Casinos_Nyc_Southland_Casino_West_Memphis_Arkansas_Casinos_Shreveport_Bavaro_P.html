    <h1>Bronco Billy S Casino Casinos Nyc Southland Casino West Memphis Arkansas Casinos Shreveport Bavaro P</h1>

<p>Hello jrjay,</p>
<p>While it is normal for a casino to have a rule stating one account per household/IP address/player, we feel each case should be considered separately. If the player has multiple accounts and has used them to repeatedly gain bonuses they should only receive once, this is obviously a clear breach of the terms and an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>After a careful review of the evidence provided by the casino, I am afraid I am no longer able to pursue this case. There is sufficient, detailed evidence of multiple accounts linked with personal information of accounts created closely together one after another. Also at least two of these connected accounts benefited from bonuses.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I will not be able to help you with this and this complaint will now be rejected. Casinos have a very strict policy regarding multiple account cases that have been used in this way.</p>
<p>I wish I could have been of more help.</p>
