<p>Phoenix Forge review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around the mythical Phoenix as well as a host of treasures.</p>
<p>Players will come upon a secret hall of jewels and gold. As they explore the world of priceless artifacts, a phoenix will be their guide, her feathers glowing with flame.</p>
<p>Fantasy lovers will adore this colourful game and feel as though they have joined an epic quest. With a little luck, they'll manage to snag their share of the precious gems.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack creates tension with climactic notes and drums. Players will feel as though they are adventurers who have reached the live-or-die point of a story.</p>
<p>The gems are animated with impressive detail from lush sapphires to luminous rubies. Each stone seems to be expertly cut and framed with an ornately-engraved setting.</p>
<p>The phoenix symbol is animated creatively with flame-like feathers and piercing blue eyes. She seems more than worthy of being the game’s namesake.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see heaps of gold coins and chests of treasure. This creates the perfect atmosphere as players explore the hidden world.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and graphics work together to create an engaging fantasy vibe.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Phoenix Forge is a five reel, three row slot, with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish after payouts, creating open positions for new symbols to fall in.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol can appear on any reel and when players land 3 or more, this triggers the Free Spin feature with 10 free spins. Landing 4 Bonus symbols awards 15 free spins, and 5 Bonus symbols secures 20 free spins.</p>
<p>Bonus symbols also pay in any position as follows:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols = x2 total bet</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols = x5 total bet</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols = x20 total bet</p>
<p>The Hot Spot Multiplier feature means that after every win and cascade, a cumulative multiplier is added to the wins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.51%, above our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility phoenix-themed slot.</p>
<p>With lush animation and a strategy profile packed with ample RTP and attractive volatility, there’s much to love about this game.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy the recognisable bonus options and fast gameplay. Though this game has not become highly popular yet, it definitely deserves attention from strategy-minded players.</p>
