<p>Piggy Riches Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Piggy Riches Megaways appears to take the old Bolshevik slur of "capitalist pig" rather literally, casting before its porcine protagonists far more than just pearls.</p>
<p>The reels are adorned in cash, the background is a McMansion complete with ugly water features and dollar topped ionic columns. The whole slot oozes a mockery of tasteless wealth that feels almost as if it is directed, rather unkindly, at the player.</p>
<p>The tongue in cheek nature of the crassness is what saves the theme from being ugly and instead feel rather fun.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are excellent with just enough flare to make them stand out, without overburdening the creators with the weight of 3D modelling.</p>
<p>The animations are fun and stand out without being complicated. They do admirably the job of keeping everything clear to the player.</p>
<p>The music and sound effects are in keeping with the theme, though players may want to mute the music after a little while as it can grate quite severely.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Piggy Riches Megaways uses the Megaways system which has six reels. Each reel has a randomised number of symbols on it between one and seven.</p>
<p>Instead of using winlines, winning combinations are any sequence of symbols on consecutive reels starting from reel one. This popular system allows for up to 117,649 ways to win.</p>
<p>There is also a cascade mechanic in place whereby, after wins are calculated, the winning combinations are removed and new symbols fall down from above to take their place. Wins are then recalculated and any further cascades occur.</p>
<p>The game does not have a gamble game and sports just one bonus game (see below for details).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. There are also MegaWilds, which can cover a full reel, and which can come with a multiplier that is applied to any winnings using that Wild.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols will give the player a spin on the Bonus wheel. This assigns up to 22 free spins and a multiplier of up to x10. The player then gets to play that number of spins with that multiplier applied to any winnings during those spins.</p>
<p>The Bonus Wheel is a nice spin on an otherwise rather basic bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.71%, a little under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin. This is a rather narrow range excluding micro-stakes players and the well-heeled punter equally and resulting in a squeezed middle. Though this range should work for most players.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies, especially when paired with a low RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Piggy Riches Megaways is a pleasant enough slot to look at with its comical take on the excesses of consumerism. It has plenty of features and enjoyable gameplay.</p>
<p>It is let down most severely by its low RTP which comes in well under average. Players wanting to use our strategies will also be disappointed by the volatility.</p>
<p>Overall we do not recommend this slot.</p>
