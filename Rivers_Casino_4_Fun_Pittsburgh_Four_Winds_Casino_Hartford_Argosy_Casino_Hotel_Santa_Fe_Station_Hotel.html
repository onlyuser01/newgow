<p>Yggdrasil has joined ReelPlay for the release of Hot Rise Games’ Nightmares VS GigaBlox with a massive win potential</p>
<p>Last week, the iconic iGaming publisher that “stands for world-class entertainment” and breaths innovation, Yggdrasil, announced the launch of Notre-Dame Tales GigaBlox, a medieval theme slot incorporating the iconic GigaBlox GEM feature.</p>
<p>The release followed other similar announcements including Badger Miners launched at the start of July, Fast Fruits DoubleMax released via Reflex Gaming on July 20, and Bucks and Doe 10K WAYS launched with the help of ReelPlay two days earlier.</p>
<p>Now, the publisher has announced another exciting collaboration with ReelPlay for the release of the Nightmares VS GigaBlox developed by Hot Rise Games. The slot packs the iconic VERSUS feature from Hot Rise along with the equally popular GigaBlox GEM.</p>

<p>Massive Coinciding Wins, Win Multipliers, Free Spins, and Buy Bonus</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, Yggdrasil’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, spoke about the popularity of horror-themed games, describing the Nightmares VS GigaBlox as a “great addition” to their YG Masters portfolio. McGinley also spoke about the GigaBlox mechanic where massive symbols can take over all 2×2, 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, and 6×6 reels, break into individual symbols, and ultimately generate massive coinciding wins.</p>
<p>The VERSUS feature comes with collection characters and free spins and can be triggered whenever a minimum of six scatter symbols are seen landing on the reels. When this occurs, players get six free spins. Additionally, Champion and Challenger symbols are randomly chosen to carry a battle across the grid.</p>
<p>All Champion and Challenger symbols that land during the free spins are collected, further boosting the feature with extra rewards including free spins, extra wilds, and win multipliers.</p>
<p>ReelPlay’s chief executive officer, David Johnson, spoke about their partner studio Hot Rise Games’ ability to produce “boundary-expanding concepts” including HOT 1 and the recently used VERSUS feature. He also called Nightmares VS GigaBlox a slot with “a frighteningly good VERSUS feature” that is prone to keep players’ interest at an all-time high.</p>
<p>The game also offers players in selected jurisdictions the chance to use the Buy Bonus feature for jumping right into the VERSUS feature in exchange for 80x their bet.</p>
<p>In February, Yggdrasil’s ongoing contributions to the iGaming industry along with their consistent delivery of premium content helped it scoop up the Innovator of the Year Award during the IGA 2023.</p>
