    <h1>Salary Of A Casino Dealer Silverton Casino Las Vegas Casino Resorts In Louisiana Niagara Casino Casi</h1>

<p>Hello everyone ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I tried to deposit at Omnislots via Mifinity on October 4th, of course it didn't work out. First I turned to Omnislots, then to Mifinity. After several emails I got the following answer:</p>

<p>Love .....,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. Please note that after verifying your account, we may determine that your transaction has been reversed.</p>
<p>Funds will be credited to your account within 3/5 business days.</p>
<p>The 3 to 5 working days are over and I still don't have my money. After further emails on my part, I got the answer from a Chester, the case is being reviewed. To make matters worse, I suddenly can no longer log in to Mifinity, I should write to support and then wait another 100 years for an incompetent answer, of course.</p>
<p>Since I'm not that stupid, I did some research and found out that you can complain about the MFSA, which is called arbriter financial services. A complaint on the site costs â‚¬25 but I don't want to do that to myself.</p>
<p>Are there other options? Has anyone had a similar experience and can give me tips?</p>
