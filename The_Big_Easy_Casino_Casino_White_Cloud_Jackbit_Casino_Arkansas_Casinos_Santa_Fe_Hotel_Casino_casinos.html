    <h1>The Big Easy Casino Casino White Cloud Jackbit Casino Arkansas Casinos Santa Fe Hotel Casino casinos</h1>

<p>Good morning Radka, and thank you for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciates what you guy are doing here at Casino Guru and looking forward to working with you in the coming months. As regards the License jurisdiction you inquired about, we had the option to obtain license from any given jurisdiction and remove the "No KYC Policy" or to operate outside any jurisdiction and keep the No KYC Policy of which we choose the later. Our license will be fairness and integrity, as well as robust customer care experiences.</p>
<p>One of the most notable Crypto Casino that offers full NO KYC services without licenses is LTC Casino and we are looking forward to joining them in that niche. Every licensed casinos requires KYC and you can't remove it and still keep your license. Since we are not the type of Casinos that hide behind lengthy and bogus Terms and Conditions, we decided to go it the gray and hard way by staying out of any particular jurisdiction while maintaining truthfulness to our customers.</p>
<p>There have been great companies such as Binance and others who have operated for years and handling billions of USD in finances without licenses. We hope to emulate these companies and let integrity be out oversight. Cryptocurrecy is designed to be anonymous and the advent of Crypto Casino license has greatly impacted the anonymity of its users.</p>
<p>We have invested a good amount of time tweaking and testing our platform and games, and now we are ready to launch officially on the 20th of December, 2022. Right now, anyone can play games, win, and make withdrawals even before the official launching date.</p>
<p>If you need any further question, I will be more than happy to provide you an answer to the best of my understanding.</p>
<p>Thank you and welcome to Fortune.st</p>
