<p>PandaScore, an esports data and odds provider, has bolstered its sales team with the addition of Oliver Niner as head of sales, who will be responsible for securing new client relationships and driving growth.</p>
<p>Oliver Niner Becomes Head of Sales at PandaScore</p>
<p>Niner has considerable industry experience, having worked at Betgenius, Marathonbet, Oulala Games, PIMS SCA, and most recently at Atlas IAC, where he served as commercial director. His expertise and experience span a wide range of industries, from sports to casinos and more.</p>
<p>Niner will apply this know-how to onboard new clients and investors, as well as to build a long-term growth and success platform. As part of the company’s larger growth plans, he will also be in charge of building out a young and seasoned sales team.</p>
<p>CEO at PandaScore, Flavien Guillocheau, said: “I would like to welcome Oliver to the team and look forward to working closely with him as we continue to position PandaScore as the number one esports data and odds provider for the global online gambling industry.”</p>
<p>Guillocheau continued by stating that Niner has the skills and expertise necessary to ensure that operators are aware of PandaScore’s market-leading products and services, as well as to handle them from contract signing to the integration and launch of the company’s data feeds and odds. As a result, he is an excellent addition to the squad.</p>
<p>Niner didn’t save his own excitement, adding that he is ecstatic to be a part of PandaScore at this critical juncture in its growth. The company already put together a fantastic team, and Niner is thrilled to be joining them and leading sales activity and development.</p>
<p>The Popularity of Esports Is Skyrocketing</p>
<p>The company’s strategy is clear: to take everything you know about competitive video gaming and turn it into actionable data that tournament managers and competitive teams can use to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Back in the day, esports may have appeared to be a trade not worth investing in, but today, esports brands are worth millions of dollars, and it is at this point that PandaScore steps in to convey patterns that the company’s qualified analysts discover from the endless stream of data.</p>
<p>Pandascore is a leader in the betting and iGaming world that recognizes the value of truly embracing esports. PandaScore’s team and Niner will take this message to the market, allowing new and existing customers to realize the full potential of an esports product delivered through Pandascore’s odds and data; these are exciting times.</p>
