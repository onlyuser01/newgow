<p>PandaScore has achieved an important milestone with the company’s entry into the Polish betting market through a local partnership with STS. Moving forward, PandaScore, which specializes in the delivery of esports betting products, will provide STS with its full suite of products in this vertical, along with various tools designed to elevate the experience.</p>
<p>Poland is one of the focal points of esports in Europe, with the country playing host to some of the most significant events on the esports calendar, including IEM Katowice. The country is also home to some of the world’s most talented players and teams, with STS and PandaScore now looking to capitalize on this love for esports and betting in the country.</p>
<p>PandaScore’s Odds feed provides hundreds of pre-match betting options that will appeal to esports fans and the bettors among them. STS is keen to expand in this particular vertical and this will be possible through the tie-up with PandaScore.</p>
<p>Among the covered events are Dota 2, CS:GO, and League of Legends, which are the biggest in terms of esports betting volume worldwide. Other events are also covered by PandaScore, and the company brings competitive markets and fair odds to create player and business value along the way.</p>
<p>PandaScore has also pioneered other excellent features such as Microbetting and Betbuilder to create even more captivating and value-added experiences for esports globally and in Poland in particular. PandaScore Senior Sales Manager Dasha Kirilishina has hailed the opportunity, and spoke about the unique ecosystem in the country:</p>
<p>"Esports is massive in Poland and the appetite for betting is substantial. By using our esports betting suite of products, STS can offer its players a compelling esports betting experience across the games and tournaments they love."</p>
<p>Kirilishina expressed confidence in the future success of the Betbuilder and Microbetting products that will significantly elevate the esports betting experience right from the start. Piotr Cerlak, STS’ Head of Sportsbook, was similarly pleased with the opportunity.</p>
<p>He said that his company saw esports and esports betting as a significant vertical to expand into, especially given the cultural significance of competitive video gaming in Poland. Commenting on STS’ ability to stay competitive in this burgeoning and fast-evolving vertical, Cerlak had this to add: "PandaScore offers us this and more, and that’s what makes this a vital partnership for us."</p>
<p>Previously, PandaScore teamed up with Dabble to bring more esports betting markets and options in Australia.</p>
