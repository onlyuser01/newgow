    <h1>Casinos In Baltimore Maryland Prairie Band Casino Casino Chip Casinos In Biloxi Ms Yamaha Casino Hot</h1>

<p>Betplay is abusing the verification process. MY ID and my bank statements have been approved, but they keep rejecting my selfie saying the ID is not visible. My selfie is very clear in my opinion, the problem is once uploaded to their website, it gets zoomed out 300%.I will also provide a screenshot of what my picture looks like once uploaded to their website.</p>
<p>I have also politely asked them for some tips and advice on how to obtain selfie that meets their requirements, the answer is always(visible ID showing 4 sides, with my face in the frame), without any clarification.</p>
<p>I understand selfie verification is part of the standard kyc verification process, so I trust people at casino guru can determine if my selfies are good enough.</p>
<p>I will also include the image of my ID, that has been approved albeit after many tries, just so you see that in order for my ID to be approved to their standards, it pretty much has to occupy the entire frame. Asking me to provide another image of ID of the same quality, while with my full face in the frame is just ridiculous.</p>
