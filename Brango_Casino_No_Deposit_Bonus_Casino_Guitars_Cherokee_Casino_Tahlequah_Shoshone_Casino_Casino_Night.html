    <h1>Brango Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Guitars Cherokee Casino Tahlequah Shoshone Casino Casino Night</h1>

<p>I have tried a lot of online casino's and they all have their flaws, moments of low win to loss ratio and absense of free games for a given period of time.</p>
<p>I have, of the many hours spent on both online and physical casino's though, never experienced a win to loss ratio this ridicolously bad as the ratio with Kansino.</p>
<p>All the spins were done with the lowest bet amount possible (0.10c), this means that I should have about 750 games AT THE LOWEST, this doesn't account for minimal cash-outs. In ALL these games I have NOT gotten a single free game. This is BY FAR the worst ratio I have encountered so far, even rigged games at a moving circus give a better win ratio.</p>
<p>I would like to request from you to make sure you let people know to stay FAR AWAY from this casino. It is better to throw your money in a bonfire, at least then you will have some warmth and light from the burned up bills.</p>
<p>As a side-note -- I never expected to win ANYTHING at ANY casino, I play purely for entertainment and the amount I deposit is money I consider lost. I do expect to actually be able to spend some time with the money I invest in my choice of recreation which is why I never deviate from the lowest bet amount on online casino's, even if I have won 1000.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see the low bet requirements, it is too bad that this turned out to be a fraud.</p>
