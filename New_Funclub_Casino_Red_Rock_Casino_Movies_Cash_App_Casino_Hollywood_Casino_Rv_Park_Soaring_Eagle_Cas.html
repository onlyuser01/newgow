<p>Hi there Casino Guru, i want to report my case with you guys about Bitstarz casino i am a member there since 27/6/2018 and i had some losts and some small wins but this year (2021) since i had a bit more of bitcoin i start gambling a bit more and i had some big wins on this casino, the firsts deposits and withdraws were smooth and everything was on track, i had some losses before but some wins recently and i enjoying quite well the casino with a nice customer support but then after my last successful withdraw everything changed since i won big 0.2btc at that time date was exacly 10 000 â‚¬ in bitcoin they hold my withdraw for one week since according to the support chat it was normal for big wins because they said that wasnt in their hands and were waiting for approval from evolution gaming since some of the wins where from there and then after being one week waiting they disable my account saying that they need to verify my account and after a few more days they block my account without any warning and then i asked the customer support why i couldnt login into my account and they very rudly said that my account was disable and would stay that way until further noticed. After a few more days waiting for the disable account review they send me this email on</p>
<p>7/4/2021 saying that " Hi there</p>
<p>Our security team has made an investigation to your account and found that you have been in violation of the following terms:</p>
<p>4.10.3</p>
<p>the result of an event has been directly or indirectly affected by criminal activity, " between other accusations that i will attach to this complain , as an ex militar i found this allegations very offensive to my honor being connected with criminal activity and to my persona when i clearly followed every T&amp;C of this casino in this 3 years of playing there and my major won was on poker where i bet big with a bet of 12.80mbtc and got a win of 102.40 mbtc as you can see on the picture that i send so therefore there is no truth in their allegations that i took advantage of any bug where you could bet with 0 risk betting low i bet pretty hight on this one was almost my entire balance and i bet with no bonus and on my own money. There are also some issues that wasnt properly answered by bitstarz casino while i was betting on live games from the evolution gaming provider with the ticket number ticket: "SD-1575320. For the final resolution Casino Customer support team will contact you.</p>
<p>Helena: Feel free to let us know if any further assistance is required."</p>
<p>Helena: Thank you for contacting us. Have a nice day!</p>
<p>So i kindly ask you guys to look into my case to prevent anymore cases like this and before i start a lawsuit with my laywer for defamation against my good name, to get acess to my wins and also to get all data in my name and the removal of all my data according to european laws of RGPD in this casinos and what data they did share with other casinos associated with Bitstarz.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Manuel P***</p>
