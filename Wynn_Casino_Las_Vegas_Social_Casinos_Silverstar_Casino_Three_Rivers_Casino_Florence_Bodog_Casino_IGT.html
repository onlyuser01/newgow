    <h1>Wynn Casino Las Vegas Social Casinos Silverstar Casino Three Rivers Casino Florence Bodog Casino IGT</h1>

<p>International Game Technology has scored in the top 88% of companies in the casino and gaming industry of the 2022 S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment</p>
<p>After receiving an improved, higher-than-average B score for its carbon footprint policy from the CDP at the end of January 2023, International Game Technology (IGT) has now announced a similar improvement in its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score.</p>
<p>IGT Has Scored in the Top 88% of Companies of the 2022 S&amp;P Global CSA</p>
<p>Camelot’s Italian-based partner ranked in the top 88% of companies in the casino and gaming industry category of the 2022 S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).</p>
<p>The NYSE-listed company represented one of the 69 companies that were evaluated in the respective category. The environmental efficiency of its operations along with the strong performance in regard to reporting on environmental and social problems have helped IGT go over its direct competitors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the improved score, IGT’s senior vice president of marketing, communications, and sustainability, Wendy Montgomery, explained the company would stay committed to promoting its “global sustainability and ESG initiatives.” Montgomery also explained the improved S&amp;P Global ranking will help IGT stay “Ahead of the Game” when it comes to using the best practices in sustainability while also getting a better understanding of the true impact of their sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>The SVP also called the improved score further proof of reassurance for stakeholders, as it comes to showcase their leadership in the industry in terms of sustainability at a global level.</p>
<p>IGT Also Received an Overall ESG Score of 52</p>
<p>On January 20, 2023, IGT was also given a 52 general ESG score in the same S&amp;P’s CSA. This score marked an important improvement compared to the company’s past assessment in regard to its performance related to 25 financially relevant sustainability social, economic, and environmental criteria.</p>
<p>Ranging from 1 to 100, general ESG scores are direct measurements of a company’s level of sustainability and they are determined by assessing a number of factors. Among them, are a company’s environmental impact and the way they treat their staff. The assessment is needed to find out if the company is meeting the best practices in these particular domains.</p>
<p>ESG scores have gained more importance for businesses in the past years in the context of the global shift to a more sustainable worldwide economy. Companies’ sustainability policies are now directly influencing stakeholders down to the supply chain.</p>
<p>At the moment, IGT, which signed an RGS IP alliance with Greentube in January, counts around 10,500 employees busy delivering entertaining and responsible experiences for sports bettors, casino, lottery, and digital players across a variety of regulated markets and channels.</p>
