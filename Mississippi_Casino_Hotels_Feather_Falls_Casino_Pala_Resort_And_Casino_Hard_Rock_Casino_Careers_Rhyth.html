<p>Scientific Games continues to lead the way in enhancing products, technology and services for lotteries</p>
<p>Provider of lottery products, technology and services, Scientific Games, announced today the launch of the new mobile app developed for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery, giving players in the state an improved lottery experience.</p>
<p>Modernized, Enhanced Features</p>
<p>The Club, the new Arkansas Lottery + Club mobile app already available through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, brings modernized and enhanced features to lottery players in the Bear State where the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery has been offering a dedicated mobile app since 2015.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Mike Smith, gaming director of the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery, outlined the wish of the lottery operator to offer its players “a modern experience and convenient, easy connection” to its games, as well as loyalty club from their mobile devices.</p>
<p>“With the new app, players verify tickets easily with the ticket checker and create digital playslips from the convenience of their phone,” he added.</p>
<p>Players can quickly check whether a ticket they have bought is a winner or not by utilizing the app’s all-new ticket checker feature, and also save their lucky numbers and play options by creating digital playslips, scanning the QR code and quickly purchasing games at any Arkansas Scholarship Lottery retailer.</p>
<p>Player Loyalty Options</p>
<p>The new version of the app keeps the feature that allows players to enter non-winning instant tickets in Play It Again drawings and other second-chance promotions offered by the lottery. The app also allows them to enter eligible instant and terminal-generated tickets to earn Points for Prizes in Scientific Games’ online store.</p>
<p>The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery and Scientific Games launched the first lottery loyalty program nationwide, and today, it is one of the most successful in the industry, boasting over 100 million tickets entered into it since its launch, awarding more than 1.2 billion points to redeem.</p>
<p>“Through continuous investment in our loyalty solution for lotteries, Scientific Games has further evolved our program by offering an upgraded, modern and native mobile app that makes it easier for players to enjoy programs like The Club in Arkansas,” commented Amy Bergette, senior vice president of Digital Solutions at Scientific Games, pointing to the company leveraging its “core strength and leadership in instant scratch games across all areas of innovation, including digital.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to players downloading the new app for an enhanced experience and connection to the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery’s games and brand,” she concluded.</p>
<p>Scientific Games has active partnerships with 130 lotteries in 50 countries, providing them and nearly every North American lottery with products, technology and services. To the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery, the company offers instant games and instant game management, licensed properties and a customer relationship management program.</p>
