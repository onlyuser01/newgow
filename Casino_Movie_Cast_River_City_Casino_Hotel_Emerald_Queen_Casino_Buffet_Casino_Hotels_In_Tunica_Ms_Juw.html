<p>Dear Jonathan,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I’m sure that you are aware of geolocation of GAMSTOP operation:</p>
<p>"GAMSTOP lets you put controls in place to help restrict your online gambling activities.</p>
<p>Sign up for the service and you will be prevented from using gambling websites and apps run by companies licensed in Great Britain, for a period of your choosing."</p>
<p>Since you have chosen casino without a license, the Gamstop scheme, unfortunately, can’t be applied here. Please could you clarify, if you have informed the Rufus Casino about your gambling problem before placing a deposit? If yes, please forward the relevant communication to kristina.s@casino.guru.</p>
<p>But I see another problem here. I checked the T&amp;Cs, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"10.4. If the cumulative amount of a player's deposit is equal to or less than € 200, the player will be limited to withdrawing up to x10 the amount of the most recent deposit. The provision is also enforceable if additional deposits are made by the player with the aim to circumvent this clause."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider this rule to be unfair and predatory, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play. Please, could you confirm, that you have accumulated winnings from a real money play and didn’t claim any bonuses?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
