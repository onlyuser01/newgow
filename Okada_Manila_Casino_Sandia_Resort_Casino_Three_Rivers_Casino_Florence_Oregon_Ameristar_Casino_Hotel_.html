    <h1>Okada Manila Casino Sandia Resort Casino Three Rivers Casino Florence Oregon Ameristar Casino Hotel</h1>

<p>Pariplay continues to position itself as a global content powerhouse in the iGaming sector after the company signed a new partnership with ComeOn Group, an operator, and will now provide a range of its games and experiences to the group’s audiences.</p>
<p>Pariplay is making available a number of its titles across ComeOn Group’s brands, including the Fusion platform and Wizard Games, an in-house studio owned by the company. This will give ComeOn Group a significant content boost, both by delivering games developed by Pariplay’s arms, and also by tapping into the aggregated content of trusted, respected, and curated third-party studios.</p>
<p>Pariplay is determined to push and expand into new markets this year, with partnerships focusing on North America, Latin America, and Africa in the coming months. Pariplay VP of Sales AndrewMaclean hailed ComeOn Group as a significant operator, and one that will ensure the company’s products are visible in the European market.</p>
<p>"We believe that we will deliver a games portfolio that speaks directly to player appetites through the Fusion aggregation platform, starting with our own Wizard Games content," Maclean added, praising Pariplay as a valued partner.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group Chief Product Officer Cristiano Blanco was similarly pleased with the opportunity, and he hailed the chance to inject more fresh content into the group’s library and offer customers fresher experiences as well.</p>
<p>"We are always looking for partners that put a safe entertainment experience at the forefront of their business, which we feel we have found in Pariplay as a partner," Blanco added, recognizing Pariplay as a worthwhile and important partner on the group’s journey to securing differentiation and driving stronger engagement through content partnerships.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been actively building its footprint across various markets in a bid to gain momentum with different brands and establish itself in local markets. Elsewhere in Europe, the company partnered with 916 Gaming to bolster its own Ignite platform and ensure that more titles reach partners such as ComeOn Group.</p>
<p>Pariplay has also grown in New Jersey and the United States over the past months, with the company most recently expanding its local footprint in the Garden State with PlayStar earlier this month. New Jersey has indeed been an important part of the North American expansion of the company, as Pariplay previously teamed up with Hard Rock Bet in November.</p>
