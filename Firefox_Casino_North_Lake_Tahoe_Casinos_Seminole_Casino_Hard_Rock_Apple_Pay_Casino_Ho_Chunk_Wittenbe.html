    <h1>Firefox Casino North Lake Tahoe Casinos Seminole Casino Hard Rock Apple Pay Casino Ho Chunk Wittenbe</h1>

<p>I'm not a big gambler but 500- 1000 euros between casinos per month is still not small. I try many casinos and like bonuses. I recently only learned about all these tiny Terms and conditions that's around.</p>
<p>So I register and decide to take advantage of the welcome deposit. I deposit R325 and it processes. I dont get my deposit. The online consultant says I needed to be R340.</p>
<p>I tell her that it didn't state anywhere that the min ZAR amount. It said 20 Euro, Fair enough.</p>
<p>I can't lay a complaint but do think a touch of personal touch to service would have made a big difference. I even offered to deposit more if I could still have my 1st deposit bonus but they refused.</p>
<p>Everyday there is more and more online casinos opening and Im starting to realise the small things makes a big difference. Maybe that's why 80% of my deposits go to FUN, Europa, and King Billy</p>
<p>0.70 Euro cents leads to lack of future deposits. I wont go back.</p>
<p>I would have been happy with ' sorry about this , its not out mistake although we could have a ZAR min on the deposit screen but hey, here 10 FS or anything to make a player feel better.</p>
<p>Vent over</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a 'small issue' but for them, you feel like a number?</p>
