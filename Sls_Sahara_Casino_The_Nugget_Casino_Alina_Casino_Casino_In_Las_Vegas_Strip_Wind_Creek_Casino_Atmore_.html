<p>Britain’s Betting and Gaming Council recently declared that the gambling industry has the potential to create 15,000 new tech jobs in five years. The Council has now announced that its members will happily support this growth.</p>
<p>The BGC Will Create 1,500 in the West Midlands</p>
<p>The move is a part of the “Leveling Up” agenda of the British government, which seeks to nurture growth in regions outside of London. One of its targets is the West Midlands where the BGC hopes to create 1,500 new jobs.</p>
<p>This goal is made possible by the numerous operators licensed in the United Kingdom. The West Midlands is where top-tier operators, run their operations, providing tremendous opportunities for capable people in the region. In addition, there are several iGaming developers that have offices in the region.</p>
<p>Notable companies that have bases in the West Midlands include bet365, Casino36, Broadway, Inspired Gaming, Gamesys and Intouch among others. Bet365, in particular, singlehandedly provides a significant chunk of the gaming jobs around. Stoke, the operator’s hometown is where a total of 4,500 gambling employees work. Notably, this is almost a quarter of the gambling workers in the entire West Midlands.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the bigger picture, the West Midlands supports a sixth of the entire British gambling industry. For reference, the region has 500 betting shops, 16 casinos and a total of 20,000 employees in the sector. Presently, the United Kingdom has a total of 120,000 people working in the iGaming, casino and bingo sector.</p>
<p>It Is Crucial to Create More Jobs and Mitigate the Post-COVID Damage</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, the chief executive officer of the BGC, previously addressed the matter. He said that the Council’s goal is to build “a world-class industry that is better understood, respected and a fully engaged member of the communities in which it operates.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Jo Gideon, a Conservative Party member serving as Stoke-On-Trent’s MP, also shared her thoughts. She emphasized that the gambling industry is currently providing a lot of high-quality jobs for skilled members of the community. Moreover, these provide excellent long-term career opportunities and enhance the standard of living for many people in the West Midlands, Gideon stated.</p>
<p>Gideon believes that job creation is very important now and is key to dealing with the disastrous consequences of COVID-19. She believes that the importance of responsible organizations that provide jobs to the people has never been greater.</p>
