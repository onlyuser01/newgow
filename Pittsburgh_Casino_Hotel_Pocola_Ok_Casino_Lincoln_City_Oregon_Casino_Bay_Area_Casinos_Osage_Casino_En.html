<p>Entain’s online sports betting and gaming brand bwin launched a new European football campaign to match the vibe of soccer fans across Europe as the continent’s most important competitions are picking up steam.</p>
<p>Proud partner of UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League, bwin and its ‘Love Knows No Boundaries’ campaign seek to remind soccer fans across Europe of the exciting season ahead as all three club competitions, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League, are still in the second round of the group phase.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new campaign, Stephan Heilmann, managing director at bwin, noted that the campaign that will have a wide rollout across Europe will be an important step in positioning the bwin brand in a distinctive way internationally.</p>
<p>“This will see us consistently position bwin in premium environments throughout national and international football to make it visible to our customers wherever the ball is rolling,” he added.</p>
<p>Being all about the fans and their love of soccer, the ‘Love Knows No Boundaries’ campaign will feature a short film at its center in which real fans coming from different cultures will discuss their passion for the sport, the football clubs, the thrill of traveling to support their favorite club on away games, as well as their most memorable moments as a sports fan.</p>
<p>“By partnering with the UEFA Europa League and the new UEFA Europa Conference League, as well as the DFB competitions and our club partners,” Heilmann continued, highlighting bwin’s ambitions to become the market leader “in terms of quality and responsibility,” as well as to “reach fans in regulated sports betting markets around the world” via bwin’s portfolio of partnerships.</p>
<p>The new campaign will further strengthen bwin’s position at the heart of Thursday night European football while the brand’s partnership with the competitions enters its second year.</p>
<p>Featuring live on TV and online, as well as in stadia across seven of bwin’s key markets of operation to allow for localization for each customer audience, the campaign will allow bwin’s customers to track the progress of their favorite teams in the competitions all the way through to the finals in Budapest and Prague.</p>
