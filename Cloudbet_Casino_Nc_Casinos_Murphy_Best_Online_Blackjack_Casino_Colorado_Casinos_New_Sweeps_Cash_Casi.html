<p>Relax Gaming continues to expand the list of partners that it aggregates content for. The latest addition features Thunderkick, a studio with an established track record and a proven development process that has created some of the most worthwhile iGaming experiences.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Adds Thunderkick to Its Powered By Program</p>
<p>Moving forward, the studio will be listed as a Powered By Relax partner and it will have its games featured in the powerful aggregation platform. Some of Thunderkick’s most powerful titles include Esqueleto Explosivo, Beat the Beast, Pink Elephants, and others.</p>
<p>All of these titles have gained global prominence owing to their gameplay, features, and unique themes, and they will now conquer more markets through Relax Gaming’s established company footprint.</p>
<p>Overall, Thunderkick brings 50 slots today that are licensed in 15 jurisdictions. The work behind these games is carried out by more than 70 professionals who work within the company and have been seeking to create a new wave of iGaming products that appeal to players of different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was extremely happy to be signing with Thunderkick. The Powered By (Relax) program is a fantastic way to help studios expand their reach, Hammon explained.</p>
