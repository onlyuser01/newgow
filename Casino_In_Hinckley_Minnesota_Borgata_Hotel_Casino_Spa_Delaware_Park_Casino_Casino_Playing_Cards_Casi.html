<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), a business-to-business provider of cloud-based iGaming services and performance marketing, has forged a new partnership with Xtremepush, a multichannel engagement platform. The deal will see the two companies combine their forces to launch new customer experiences.</p>
<p>GiG and Xtremepush Join Forces</p>
<p>Xtremepush aims to deliver quick and relevant communications to players, helping them enjoy premium immersive experiences. To that end, the company will work alongside GiG. The two will combine their strengths to create enhanced customer experiences.</p>
<p>GiG will make use of its novel customer-oriented platform while Xtremepush will leverage its superior data and engagement platform to provide clients with a higher degree of personalization and segmentation.</p>
<p>As a result, clients who use GiG’s platform will also be able to use Xtremepush’s customer relations management (CRM) marketing. Gaming companies that opt to use the integration will be able to access a full range of solutions, including player profiles that provide actionable data in real-time. Thus, partnering operators will be able to launch personalized campaigns that engage bettors with great one-to-one experiences. Thanks to the conjoined efforts of GiG and Xtremepush, their partners will be able to boost player acquisition and retention, raise lifetime value and increase wallet share.</p>
<p>GiG and Xtremepush’s main objective is to help operators become closer to their customers.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Complement Each Other</p>
<p>Robbie Sexton, Xtremepush’s head of partnerships, noted that the new agreement greatly excites his team. He noted that Gaming Innovation Group is a natural fit for Xtremepush as the two companies’ platforms naturally complement each other.</p>
<p>Our platforms’ functionality naturally complements each other and provides an excellent opportunity for both companies to create and deliver relevant, rewarding, and exciting experiences for customers across the globe. Robbie Sexton, head of partnerships, Xtremepush</p>
<p>Martin Collins, Gaming Innovation Group’s director of business development, also shared his thoughts. He noted that GiG realizes the need to provide quick and adaptable tech that will provide it with an edge over its competitors.</p>
<p>The addition of Xtremepush’s data understanding and multichannel delivery capabilities to our platform further enhances our ability to generate meaningful value, growing a loyal customer base and expanding commerciality. Martin Collins, director of business developments, GiG</p>
<p>A week ago, GiG was officially approved to launch its offerings in Pennsylvania. The top-tier provider continues its growth journey in the important North American market. This same journey saw GiG ink a partnership deal with Crab Sports, a Maryland-based sports betting startup.</p>
<p>While NA might be one of GiG’s core markets, the company also seeks to expand beyond the New World. A few weeks ago, it signed a new agreement with Luckiest.com, an iGaming operator that targets markets under the jurisdiction of the Alderney Gambling Control Commission.</p>
