    <h1>Pokerstars Casino Renaissance Curacao Resort Casino Casino In Green Bay Avantgarde Casino No Deposit</h1>

<p>Dear januspetke,</p>
<p>I was in contact with casino representatives, and I received the following information:</p>
<p>Your account has been flagged as a high-risk one by the casino's responsible department, and KYC has not been completed yet for an unspecified reason</p>
<p>Your account has been credited with the (possibly previously confiscated) $50 you won from Free Spins, regardless of whether you breached the casino's Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>You have to pass KYC to withdraw these funds</p>
<p>The good news is that your disputed winnings have been credited back to your account. On the other side, the main issue of your complaint is KYC/verification, and we have not been provided with more details.</p>
<p>I asked the casino representative to provide me with more details regarding the verification and will let you know once I know more. Also, I will try to set up a casino representative account in our system, so they will be able to reply directly in the thread. Unfortunately, they do not have such an account yet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while we will wait for further details from the casino, allow me please to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>Did the casino contact you recently? If yes, what information did they provide to you? If not, could you please try to contact the casino's Customer Support, and ask them about the status of your account and updates? Alternatively, could you ask them what is needed to do on your side to complete the verification, and let me know about any news if they respond?</p>
<p>Is there a possibility that you registered another account earlier at the casino in the past and that you used the same bonus offer on this account? Is this your first account registered at the casino and the first time you used the bonus that your disputed winnings were earned from? Or, do you know about anyone around you that could also have an account at the casino and possibly use the same internet connection/device to play there?</p>
