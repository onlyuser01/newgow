    <h1>Casino On St Croix Casinos In Bahamas Chumba Casinos Com Hollywood Casino Maryland Heights Mo Spokan</h1>

<p>Wazdan will expand its presence in the Garden State, supplying Tipico with content that is proven to resonate with local gamblers</p>
<p>Leading innovative online casino games provider Wazdan has launched content in New Jersey thanks to a new agreement with Tipico. As a result, the former company will leverage Light &amp; Wonder’s iGaming ecosystem to roll out a number of games on Tipico’s platform.</p>
<p>Tipico will thus become the third gambling operator in the state to integrate Wazdan’s cutting-edge titles into its platform. As a result, its players will be able to try out some of the supplier’s best games, including 9 Coins, Sun of Fortune, Hot Slot Mystery Jackpot Joker and Magic Spins, among others.</p>
<p>In addition, the supplier will also add the award-nominated game Power of Gods: Hades to Tipico’s portfolio, allowing it to channel more players toward its platform.</p>
<p>Players in the Garden State will also be able to experience Wazdan’s state-of-the-art engagement features and win huge prizes. Thanks to the launch, Tipico’s New Jerseyan players will get to play games incorporating the Hold the Jackpot, Cash Infinity, Collect to Infinity and Volatility Levels features.</p>
<p>The deal will expand Wazdan’s footprint in the state. The company already supplies content to two other operators, namely DraftKings and Rush Street Interactive.</p>
<p>The launch comes a few weeks after the supplier’s HalloWIN campaign and the launch of the sequel of Los Muertos.</p>
<p>Wazdan’s Games Resonate with New Jerseyan Audiences</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, Andrzej Hyla, commented on the new partnership. He noted that his team is thrilled to be able to bolster its presence in New Jersey and called Tipico a “hugely exciting brand.”</p>
<p>Hyla added:</p>
<p>Our partnership with Light &amp; Wonder has been a vital part of our growth in North America, and we’re confident that this will be another boost to all parties. Andrzej Hyla, CCO, Wazdan</p>
<p>A Tipico New Jersey spokesperson also commented on the agreement, praising Wazdan’s proven titles. They said that the company produces games that resonate with players in the Garden State, which is why the operator is glad to sign this partnership.</p>
<p>With bold themes, engaging genres, and an array of engagement tools that are clear fan favorites, we’re very happy to be offering these and look forward to our player’s reactions. Tipico spokesperson</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Tipico signed an important ID verification partnership agreement with SONIO, an expert in identity orchestration.</p>
