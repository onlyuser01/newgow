<p>Best Jackpot Slots to Play in 2024</p>
<ol>
<li>Shopping Spree</li>
</ol>
<p>Read yourself up, because it’s the festive season and we are talking about some very big jackpots here! The game comes with a 95.44% RTP, which is pretty decent when you consider that this is a progressive jackpot slot! The game features very juicy jackpot amounts, and we have seen the pot grow well beyond $2 million, just there for the taking.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay and core mechanics, Shopping Spree is a well-thought-out game, with the title featuring free spins and the Mystery Grab Bag Bonus Round where you will click on question marks to multiply your bet and win big. The game has a slightly higher bet per spin level at $0.25, but this is all right as there are plenty of freebies along the way.</p>
<p>The mall-themed game has its own charm and is a distinct title on our list of the best big jackpot slots you can try this year!</p>
<p>Play Shopping Spree</p>
<ol>
<li>Gold Rush Gus</li>
</ol>
<p>The mustachioed Gus is back, baby – or was it that he was never gone? This quintessential American miner is full of vim and vigor, and it just so happens that he offers a big jackpot for you to enjoy as well. The progressive jackpot feature is definitely swell, and the game comes with a really good 98% RTP, which is let’s face it – the best RTP on a slot you will see in a long time!</p>
<p>Now, the minimum bet is a bit high, with $0.60 as the starting option. The game features 5 reels and 10 slot lines and takes you on a trip through the brightly lit mine where Gus excavates all sorts of shiny gems and precious stones with his trusted pickaxe.</p>
<p>Thematic excellence aside, Gold Rush Gus features Mini Jackpot and Progressive Jackpot options. When we last checked, Gold Rush Gus was pushing a progressive jackpot of $291,000. You also can participate in the very thematic Bonus Game which is a Map Symbol that leads to even more gains!</p>
<p>Then, there are the free spins – lots of them, too! Players get to trigger and re-trigger the free rounds for more added satisfaction to their gameplay.</p>
<p>Play Gold Rush Gus</p>
<ol>
<li>777 Deluxe</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the newer titles available in the slot portfolio of jackpot slots, 777 Deluxe combines classic and modern gameplay to bring you a rewarding experience. Players will get to benefit from a host of excellent features, including a dedicated bonus game, progressive jackpots, autoplay options, a multiplier, a scatter symbol, and more.</p>
<p>To get your hands on the progressive jackpot feature, you will have to get three gold 7’s, which trigger the bonus level. There are also 10 to infinite spins which you can set with the Autoplay Option for added comfort, and yes, a multiplier will make the overall experience all the more worthwhile for you.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is a Scatter Symbol that will help you push your winnings further along by filling in for some of the missing ones. 777 Deluxe runs decent bonuses as well, and at the time of writing this, the jackpot was actually $72,000. Not too bad when you consider that it drops more often than Shopping Spree!</p>

<li>10 Times Vegas</li>
</ol>
<p>10 Times Vegas is an absolute blast of a game. This Neon-lit 80s-styled game will bring you tons of fun moments when you first set out to explore it, with a Wild Symbol that will retrigger other symbols and fill in for missing ones in combinations. The grid is a neat three-by-three grid with the jackpot neatly displayed on top of the grid.</p>
<p>At the time of writing 10 Times Vegas is offering $95,000, a pretty decent jackpot slot if you ask us. The classic grid is elevated by the nice visual aids that continuously offer inspired gameplay for players and make for fun and rewarding gameplay.</p>
<p>There are Wild Symbols that serve as multipliers with the potential to multiply your bet by 10x and win a pretty solid amount from the base game already. The Jackpot is triggered with its own Jackpot spin symbol, and it follows its own unique paytable.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we are on it, this slot only has three paylines, which is still neat, as it offers a massive 96.50% RTP in the base game alone, which is more than great. This and the fact you may win a jackpot makes 10 Times Vegas a really good choice of a jackpot slot.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Night With Cleo</li>
</ol>
<p>A Night With Cleo is one of the most highly thematic and fun jackpot games to play and try your hand at. Let’s start with the fact that this is perhaps one of the most visually polished titles to explore as well. Players will play a title that offers 95.49% RTP which is a bit low, but the jackpot and other features more than make up for this.</p>
<p>You can bet anything between $0.20 and $200 and have a 2,500 multiplier on your bet. The jackpot title comes with Wild Symbol, along with Free Spins that can trigger 15 free spins, and not least, a Gamble Feature where you can flip a coin up to five times to double your wins with every successful flip.</p>

The visuals are excellent, and the design is very authentic, with the jackpot amount conveniently ticking at the top of the game’s grid.</p>
<p>In a sense, Dragon’s Siege reminds you of choose-and-play slots where you pick different characters to secure different bonuses, such as the Knight in Shiny Armor, the Green Drake, or the Castle, among others. Players may win up to 25 free spins and enter the Dragon’s Secret Lair where the drake has been hoarding its wealth and treasured goods.</p>
<p>There is also a 10x multiplier that applies to the free spins. With 20 paylines and 98% in RTP, Dragon’s Siege is without a doubt one of the best jackpot slots to try your hand at.</p>

Marked by high-quality 3D graphics, this is a slot that will let you have a shot at winning a pretty coin. There is a special Coin Drop mechanic that will make symbols cascade and trigger even more wins.</p>

Interestingly, if you get two symbols triggering the feature, you will get 6 Free Spins, in a classic case less is more.</p>
<p>And although the 3-6 Free Spins may not seem all that much at first blush, you will get special symbols during the level that can award 10x multipliers calculated on your base bet along with more bonus rounds that are added to the free games! You could get up to 25 Free Spins this way, which is a lot.</p>
<p>To get to the bonus level and have a shot at the jackpot, you need two Book of Secrets Symbols. Oh, and if this isn’t enough, remember that you can always use the Double Up feature to try and win more!</p>

<p>If big jackpot slots are your thing, you would be remiss not to have a crack at Mr Vegas. In terms of theme and visuals, the game features a bunch of slick characters, such as a suggestively mustachioed Mafiosi-type in a tux, what could be the general manager of a casino, and several gorgeous women.</p>
<p>The game, though, is hardly about its refined look, as Mr Vegas brings a ton of excellent features, including, Free Spins and Multipliers. You can also land 5 slabs to enter the progressive jackpot level and a separate Bonus Round for even more fun.
