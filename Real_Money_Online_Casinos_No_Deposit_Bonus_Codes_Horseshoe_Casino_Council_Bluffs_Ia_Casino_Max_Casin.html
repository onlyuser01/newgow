    <h1>Real Money Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Codes Horseshoe Casino Council Bluffs Ia Casino Max Casin</h1>

<p>There are only three races left on the NASCAR calendar and the Hollywood Casino 400 will be a great opportunity to enjoy the final days of the season. Kyle Larson has been able to bring in two back-to-back victories, conquering both the Bank of America Royal 400 and Autotrader Echopark Automotive 500.</p>
<p>With 8wins this season and 18 Top 5 finishes, the driver is ahead of Ryan Blaney and Denny Hamlin by over 60 points. He will need to keep his performance in order to keep the gap between the runner-ups. Whether he can we will find him at this Sunday’s Hollywood Casino 400.</p>
<p>Odds to Win Hollywood Casino 400</p>
<p>Driver Odds Kyle Larson +240 Denny Hamlin +550 Kyle Busch +600 Chase Elliott +800 William Byron +900 Ryan Blaney +1000 Martin Truex Jr. +1100 Brad Keselowski +1400 Joey Logano +1600 Kevin Harvick +1800 Odds at DraftKings as of October 22</p>
<p>Larson is clearly looking up to secure this season’s title and Hollywood Casino 400 will be an important test to his mettle. Can he rally and make it through the finish line? The truth is, Larson need not necessarily win – he just needs another Top 5 finish to stay competitive. The event will be getting underway at the Kansas Speedway at 3:00 pm ET on Sunday, October 24.</p>

<p>Hollywood Casino 400 Pick and Prediction</p>
<p>Kyle Larson is looking to overcome the competition posted at (+240) in the lead and he seems to have been clocking in the hours necessary to keep the momentum from his past back-to-back wins. It’s easy to see that Larson’s dominance doesn’t stretch to just winning events outright. He is one of the most capable drivers when it comes to Top 5 finishes, posting consistency that no other driver has been able to match.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are others who will try to shoot for the title. Hamlin (+550) will definitely not relent as he is close to bridging the point gap between himself and Larson. A win is very important to the Ford driver as he will be doing his best as well.</p>
<p>Kyle Bush (+600) is another driver you may want to keep an eye out for just in case. He has had decent performances in the Bank of America and Autotrader Echopark but he would need to pull off an unexpected performance through and through to live up to a win in Hollywood Casino 400.</p>
<p>Truth be told, we have endless possibilities for the upcoming weekend race and that is what makes it fun. Either way, we feel the final action will come down to a bet between Larson and Hamlin.</p>
