    <h1>Casino Hollywood Fl Casino Charleston Wv Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Qcc Casino Casino Royal</h1>

<p>Lightcasino closed my account in the middle of the game and has not given any reason. A withdrawal of 500 euros was being processed and there was also some money in the account. Withdrawals are supposed to be "lightning fast", but I still haven't received it after a couple of days of waiting.</p>
<p>The Finnish-speaking customer service gave no other reason for closing the account than "routine checks" and did not say when the account would be opened or if I would get my money.</p>
<p>If the casino routinely closes accounts without explanation, I don't recommend using it.</p>
