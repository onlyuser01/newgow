    <h1>Santa Casino Casino In Wheeling Wv Rio Hotel Casino Best Casino In Atlantic City Sandia Casino DelOr</h1>

<p>Dear Radka,</p>
<p>We completely agree and we now have a different technical solution. We thought and still think that the best solution when it comes to our members is by speaking with them and letting them know the situation so that they feel comfortable but we guess in this case cancelling the bonus would have made the situation much better.</p>
<p>"It is the casino, of all others, that has refused all proposals for compensation. Do you understand that your request is not legally binding?"</p>
<p>We are unsure what compensation he wants. If he lost money while wagering we would have compensated him which most casinos would not do but he won money. The reason that the $250 was removed because that was the bonus money completed during the wager that he already completed and got once. This would have been his second $250 bonus he received.</p>
<p>It isn't a matter of the money it is a matter of fairness to the rest of the community and a matter of principle.</p>
<p>"The casino has removed the $250 I won when I achieved the match bonus from my balance without my permission."</p>
<p>Around 5 days before he completed the wager requirement we told him that we would do this. It was no surprise, but we asked him to cancel it himself instead of us having to do it for him. We also explained that we would compensate him if he lost money which he didn't. His withdrawals were instant and he won a lot of money in our casino and was able to withdraw $1500. Which many casinos I am sure would have given a hard time for this in the beginning.</p>
<p>We have members come into our casino with $10 and leave with $1000 and they are in shock that they were able to withdraw this money because of previous bad experiences they have had. We are an extremely fair casino and we have members that have gone to 1000 other casinos but they come to our casino everyday.</p>
<p>The compensation that is being requested for andandjonnyx is not understood by us.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Del Oro Casino and Sportsbook Team</p>
