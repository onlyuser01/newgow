    <h1>The Casino Dania Beach Hayward Wi Casino Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes For Existing Player</h1>

<p>Dear Jane,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Gratorama Casino is excluded for the Danish players in our review:</p>
<p>I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Participation in the activities and games of Gratorama:</p>
<p>You warrant and represent that: you are not a resident of: USA, Israel, France, French Territories, Netherland, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Iraq, Algeria, Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Tunisia, South Africa, Australia, Iran and UK."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize two important facts from our Fair Gambling Codex:</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries</p>
<p>"For a casino to be classified as a 'fair casino' or a 'fair and safe casino' by our review team, it must not allow players from restricted countries to create an account and play. The check for restricted countries must be done during the account-creation process."</p>
<p>https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-bonuses</p>
<p>"For a casino to be classified as a 'fair casino' or a 'fair and safe casino' by our review team, it should not allow players to receive a bonus that is not meant to be received by them because of country restrictions."</p>
<p>To summarize: Casinos should only give bonuses to players who are allowed to get them according to the Bonus T&amp;Cs. And if the casino makes the mistake of granting a bonus to a player who shouldn't have received it, the casino shouldn't take it away from them. Instead, the casino should accept that it was their mistake and pay out the winnings to the player.</p>
<p>Jane, I would like to ask you for a confirmation, that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account and you’ve submitted Denmark when completing the Registration.</p>
<p>Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
