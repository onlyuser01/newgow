<p>Information about HiPay casinos</p>
<p>This page is dedicated to helping you find the best HiPay online casinos. These are casinos that support HiPay as a payment method, and you can read about how to find great options below.</p>
<p>HiPay is a payment service provider based in France that allows customers to carry out digital transactions through a variety of products.</p>
<p>Read below to find out more information about HiPay as a company, the pros and cons of its service, as well as how to make a deposit with this payment method. For anyone interested in online casino bonuses offered by HiPay casinos, there is also a section dedicated to those.</p>

<p>About HiPay</p>
<p>HiPay started trading in 2015, when it became an independent entity from the HiMedia Group. Its focus was on the online market where it began to offer an agile e-wallet and payment service to customers, and a ready-to-use platform for internet merchants.</p>
<p>By 2017, it was processing €2.2 billion in transactions per year, a figure that rose to almost €4 billion just two years later. Such rapid growth reflected a solid commercial strategy within the company and led to it being recognized as a major payment provider in Europe. It was also the result of an expansion to other countries: along with its headquarters in Paris, HiPay now has offices in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, as well as the United States and Brazil.</p>
<p>HiPay's products are compatible with many big card brands. These include Visa and Mastercard, and its international presence means local options, such as Multibanco in Portugal and Belgium's Belfius, are also included.</p>
<p>Like many e-wallets, HiPay is useful for customers in that it provides them with one place to handle multiple online transactions. You can pay for internet shopping, book flights and, of course, make online casino deposits by using this service – all while keeping your sensitive banking info safe.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of HiPay Casinos</p>
<p>As an established provider in a very competitive market, HiPay has to offer its customers a range of benefits to stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>We can see these in several advantages, as follows:</p>
<p>Quick service</p>
<p>Most digital payment services make speed the focal point of their service as they try to tempt customers away from digital banking, so HiPay's quick transfers are nothing new. That said, its instant payment service is very convenient for casino deposits, especially for players who are eager to get started.</p>
<p>Cheaper than traditional bank transfers</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with expensive wire transfers that don't offer value for money. HiPay subscribes to the popular category of providers who charge consumers very low fees, if any at all: instead, they make most of their money from the businesses operating their platform.</p>
<p>A commitment to security</p>
<p>Safety is also essential. HiPay's anti-fraud system boasts a series of the latest measures, including 3D-Secure where customers must fill out extra info about themselves before buying products. While this acts as a kind of 'safe lock', it can also be a little frustrating if you're in a rush.</p>
<p>HiPay's quality service isn't perfect, however. Here are a couple of negative details to look out for.</p>
<p>Lack of a live chat option</p>
<p>In today's super-connected world, every big business should have a live agent available to chat to customers. HiPay doesn't seem to have this, at least for new customers. Instead, they ask you to fill out an e-form, which obviously takes longer to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Unavailable in some big markets</p>
<p>HiPay is widely available in many markets, but a few big nations miss out. The USA is the best example: HiPay's absence there means many casino players can't use it.</p>
<p>How to use HiPay in online casinos</p>
<p>HiPay's benefits are available to online casino players who want to make deposits. If you're one of these, then the transaction should only take a couple of minutes by following these steps:</p>
<p>Make sure you are fully registered with both HiPay and the online casino, and that you have your banking info at hand. Sign in to the casino and head to the Cashier page. Choose HiPay from the list of payment methods. Type in the amount you wish to deposit. Log in to your e-wallet on the new window that appears. Once back on the casino page, double-check the deposit amount and confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>If you don't see the funds in your casino balance after an hour or so, then check with either HiPay or the online casino to see if everything went through OK.</p>
<p>HiPay Withdrawals</p>
<p>You can also carry out withdrawals with HiPay, which not every payment method allows. This will also depend on the casino in question though.</p>
<p>To do this, follow the same process as above except go to the 'Withdrawal' section of the casino. Once done, this will typically take longer to complete than a deposit – maybe a day or two – and you may be charged a fee for doing so.</p>
<p>Finding the best HiPay casino for you</p>
<p>When it comes to online safety, it's essential that HiPay casinos comply with the same strict standards that HiPay does. Finding a trustworthy site can be a time-consuming process, though, so Casino Guru can do the hard work for you.</p>
<p>Our team uses a casino rating and review system to assess each site according to objective factors, such as its customer complaints and how many casino games it offers. All of these are then condensed into a special Safety Index, which we can use to determine its suitability – you can see the rating in the casino's information box.</p>
<p>To quickly get a selection of the best HiPay casinos, select the 'Recommended' tab at the top of the page. We urge you to start with these if you're after a great playing experience.</p>
<p>The 'Newly opened' tab, meanwhile, lets you see a list of new HiPay casinos. Many players like to check out new casinos for possible generous welcoming offers as the site attempts to create a strong reputation and player base.</p>
<p>You can also check out a range of other useful filters, including:</p>
<p>Game provider: this sorts the casinos according to providers they offer. Popular ones include NetEnt and Red Tiger.</p>

<p>Once you've found your ideal casino, then read the information about it before making a deposit. It's important to be as informed as possible before parting with your money.</p>
<p>HiPay casino bonuses</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses are an important part of attracting new players – and they can also be a nice extra for players when used in the right way. You might even have received one before: maybe it was a deposit bonus that you got after your first deposit, or even a no deposit bonus in exchange for just registering.</p>
<p>Several HiPay casinos offer bonuses to new customers, and you can find these by going to Casino Guru's list of casino bonuses, and ticking the HiPay box. You'll then see a selection of offers, which you can narrow down further according to their type. For deposit bonuses, for example, choose the 'Deposit Bonus' box in the 'Bonus Type' section. Another way to see these is by going to our list of deposit bonuses and selecting 'HiPay' there.</p>
<p>Remember that all of these offers should be up to date on the day that you search for them. Our team works hard to refresh them regularly.</p>
