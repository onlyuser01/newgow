<p>This certification marks another significant milestone for Sportradar, as it expands its presence in the rapidly growing US sports betting market</p>
<p>Sports data and technology company Sportradar Group has recently obtained a full Sports Gaming Supplier Certificate for its subsidiary, Sportradar Solutions LLC, enabling it to offer sports betting services in the state of Kansas.</p>
<p>Sportradar Extends Services to Kansas Companies</p>
<p>Earlier in September 2022, the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission had granted Sportradar a temporary certification. However, with the recent acquisition of the full Sports Gaming Supplier Certificate, Sportradar can now provide its range of services to companies based in Kansas. These services include integrity solutions such as bet monitoring, detection, intelligence, investigation, education, prevention, and integrity audits.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s offerings extend beyond integrity services. They also provide sports solutions, such as Synergy Sports and InteractSport, as well as digital products, betting and gaming platforms, and advertising services. With a wide range of comprehensive solutions, Sportradar aims to support and enhance the sports betting experience in Kansas.</p>
<p>Kansas itself is a relatively new player in the sports betting arena, having only legalized it on July 1, 2022. Since then, a soft launch of sports betting has taken place, with six online sportsbooks currently operating in the state, including industry leaders like DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM. However, the landscape may evolve with the recent announcement of PointsBet’s departure from the US sports betting market.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s Suite of Services to Boost Integrity and Growth in Kansas Sports Betting</p>
<p>Amidst these developments, Sportradar’s entry into the Kansas market brings additional competition and choice for both sports betting operators and consumers. As a trusted and established player in the industry, Sportradar’s suite of services and expertise is expected to bolster the growth and integrity of the Kansas sports betting ecosystem.</p>
<p>Sportradar’s latest financial results revealed strong performance in the first quarter of 2023, with a 24% increase in quarterly revenue, reaching €207.6 million ($226.2 million). Although net profit fell slightly compared to the previous year, the company’s adjusted EBITDA showed a significant increase of 37%.</p>
<p>With 46 licenses to operate across North America and Canada, Sportradar continues to solidify its position as a leading provider of sports data, technology, and betting solutions. As the sports betting market in Kansas gains traction, the inclusion of Sportradar’s services is set to shape the future of sports wagering in the state, offering a seamless and secure experience for both operators and bettors alike.</p>
<p>In other news, Sportsradar has also been making strides in the South American market. It has been awarded exclusive global audio and video (AV) and betting data rights by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). The agreement covers the next four seasons and includes prestigious club tournaments such as CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana, aiming to enhance accessibility and engagement for South American football.</p>
