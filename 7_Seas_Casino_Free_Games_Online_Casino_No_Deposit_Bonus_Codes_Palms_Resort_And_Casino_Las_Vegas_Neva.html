<p>All right! But STOPPPPP!!</p>
<p>It's nice of them to give me the opportunity to complete verification, but they still canceled my winnings!</p>
<p>After such a long wait and disappointment, what's the point of verification or the effort for it if I don't even have the opportunity to continue playing or cashing out any of the winnings described above?</p>
<p>After I lost so much money, only the last deposit that I invested for the profit was made available to me in the account. (100 â‚¬)</p>
<p>There are 8500 euros that should be credited as winnings!</p>
<p>So that what you are talking about here also comes to fruition. I really ask that the winnings be credited back to my account so that I can trust that they will really give me a chance and think about the customer. (and don't agree now like here in the forum but the other side of the coin is something else)</p>
<p>Or is it perhaps the case that as soon as my verification is completed, my previous winnings that were still in the account will be credited back</p>
<p>before it closed?!</p>
<p>Then I would be happy and calm!</p>
<p>They make enough money in the industry and in the long term they will earn enough money from me even according to the current balance sheets, so they credit the profits back.</p>
<p>I also sent my personal details and other documents via email on August 19th!</p>
<p>QuickWin show real empathy please I am a long term customer but with all due respect don't act like you are accommodating me just because I have the opportunity in yours</p>
<p>casino to be able to be active again.</p>
<p>The case described here is primarily about my winnings being withdrawn and my account being closed.</p>
<p>not just one part but both points please.</p>
<p>I hope that the matter will be clarified and I am glad that we have received feedback from you and that we have received a positive assessment with a good result and that the situation is a win-win situation for everyone</p>
<p>win one for you: long-term customer</p>
<p>for me: loyalty, understanding, empathy, trust and security and communication with the casino</p>
<p>for Casino guru: another case that has been solved that will definitely make many players aware of QuickWin after a good solution!!</p>
<p>Because there are also complaints at other casinos, it could be that customers of other casinos decide to play at QuickWin in the future if they read and understand this article.</p>
<p>I ask for a positive, quick response</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
