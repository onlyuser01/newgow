    <h1>Casino In North Carolina Durant Casino Resort Hotel Jackpot Junction Casino Casinos In Las Vegas Lux</h1>

<p>Regarding the money still pending in slotVibe, I’ve been to the bank, and I’ve been speaking with them about it,</p>
<p>They have informed me the money has left my account, has gone to slotVibe and hasn’t been returned, hasn’t bounced back, nothing.</p>
<p>So now, I’d like all the money that’s sitting in my profile listed as pending to reimbursed please.</p>
<p>Listed below is all months from December 2021 when the first two pending transactions started,</p>
<p>21st December 2021 - 23:04 - $1500</p>
<p>21st December 2021 - 23:54 - $1500</p>
<p>6th January 2022 - 16:18 - $150</p>
<p>6th January 2022 - 16:57 - $150</p>
<p>16th April 2022 - 17:35 - $30</p>
<p>25th April 2022 - 18:04 - $30</p>
<p>They are all the transactions that are pending, haven’t been sent back to my account, nothings been done.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry but enough is enough.</p>
<p>I want my money back. And I want this sorted out.</p>
<p>All documentation requested has been emailed today the 27th June 2022 by a lady who works at my bank after going in and speaking with them about what has happened.</p>
<p>I want this rectified immediately, asap.</p>
<p>It’s been long enough. Everything they told me about money coming back ect was a lie and never was true.</p>
<p>So now, they will rectify this issue. As I gave them the benefit of the doubt that slotVibe and would sort this dramaand slotVibe as a company have not.</p>
<p>So please.</p>
<p>Return the money from my slotVibe account that’s pending. Cause it’s quite clear.</p>
<p>It’s not been played, it’s been taken from my account and it hasn’t been returned, it hasn’t even been attempted on your end to be sorted out.</p>
