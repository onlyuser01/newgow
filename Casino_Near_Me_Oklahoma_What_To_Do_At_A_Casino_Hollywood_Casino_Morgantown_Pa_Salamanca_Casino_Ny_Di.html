<p>Thrilling Take on the Hold and Win Style Games</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs Stuart McCarthy spoke about the ReelPlay partnership, explaining how it will enable them to “bring numerous concepts and excitement to the market.” McCarthy also described the new game as one that will introduce players to a “thrilling take” on the prestigious hold-and-win games.</p>
<p>ReelPlay’s chief executive officer David Johnson also spoke about the new Professor Clank’s Combinator slot, describing it as a “fresh take on cascading gameplay.” He also mentioned the reactions, ways, boosters, morphs, and bonus re-spins rounds as important game elements. Johnson called Professor Clank “the most extraordinary inventor engineer.”</p>
<p>Game Design, Symbols &amp; Special Mechanics</p>
<p>The game is designed with the image of a steampunk-inspired workshop filled with all kinds of interesting gadgets made of brass. The slot is extremely colorful, with fizzing, popping, and jiggling sounds carrying players to the action-packed reels. The game also features a Machinarium. A win is fired every fourth reel spin or so. The paytable is filled with welded steel cards from 9 to A. These pay anywhere between 0.5 to 1.2x the initial stake for matching a minimum of six symbols. Blasters, robots, and goggles are higher paying symbols worth between 2x and 10x the original bet for six identical symbols. Professor Clank represents the wild symbol in the game. He pops on the second, third, fourth, and fifth reels to replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of the scatter.</p>
<p>At the start of each new round, every reel is three symbols high. Once a winning combo is hit, all non-winning symbols disappear during an explosion. The remaining symbols continue to drop down to reach the bottom of each column. Provided that more than one type of symbol is still standing after the explosion, all symbols morph into the game’s highest paying symbol. When no more wins are possible, the game triggers the boosters which guarantees a new win.</p>
<p>Respins Bonus Feature</p>
<p>When a player lands a minimum of five scatters, the respins bonus feature is enabled. Each of the available scatters carries a certain cash value. Each successful cascade resets the count to three. The game has four special bonus types up for grabs: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, which can award up to 2,000x. Some jurisdictions will allow players to buy the bonus round using a dedicated buy feature.</p>
<p>In mid-July, Yggdrasil and Bulletproof Games inked a similar partnership deal for the launch of Mega Cash Stacks. At the end of June, the provider partnered with Jelly to release Buffalo Blox Gigablox.</p>
