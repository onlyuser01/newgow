<p>Tom Brady Rumored to Be Leaving Pats, Odds Shorten on Las Vegas Raiders Landing 6x Super Bowl Champ</p>

<p>Tom Brady met with several teams this week, including the Las Vegas Raiders, and NFL insiders claim the six-time Super Bowl champ is ready to leave New England.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old can officially begin negotiating with teams on March 17 once he formally becomes an unrestricted free agent. Patriots own Robert Kraft says it’s his “hope and prayer” that the best quarterback to ever play the game returns to his organization, but adds Brady’s “earned the right to do what’s best for him.”</p>
<p>NFL insiders, including ESPN’s Jeff Darlington, says it’s not looking good for a return to Foxboro. Darlington said Thursday that he would be “stunned” if Brady goes back to New England.</p>
<p>The odds are lengthening on Brady staying put. His line has shrunk from -300 (implied chance 75 percent) in late January, to -125 (55.56 percent) this week.</p>
<p>Karen Guregian, the Boston Herald’s beat reporter for the Patriots, said the Patriots have not yet reached out to Brady’s camp to discuss a new contract.</p>
<p>Other QB legends, including Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, and Joe Namath all ended their storied careers with teams where they didn’t spend the vast majority of their playing days. The same can be said for basketball legend Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Odds</p>
<p>Work is nearing completion on the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium. Located just west of the Las Vegas Strip across I-15, the 65,000-seat domed venue is the home of the Raiders.</p>
<p>Brady has played his entire 20-year career in New England.</p>
<p>After the Patriots, the Raiders have the next best odds of landing Brady at +450. That’s down slightly from +500. Other teams in the running include the Indianapolis Colts (+650), Los Angeles Chargers (+700), and Tennessee Titans (+750). Brady chatted with all of those teams this week.</p>
<p>His wife Gisele Bundchen was asked on Instagram Thursday, “Where will you be living this year?” She answered, with a chuckle, “I would love to know, but I don’t know that yet. Hopefully somewhere nice and wherever my husband is happy playing.”</p>
<p>Raiders owner Mark Davis was spotted with Brady at UFC 246 last month before the Conor McGregor vs. Donald Cerrone fight. UFC President Dana White, a longtime friend of Brady’s, told reporters afterwards, “If that dude isn’t playing for Boston, he’s playing here.”</p>
<p>NFL Futures</p>
<p>The Raiders are currently at +5000 to win the next Super Bowl. Only four teams have longer odds.</p>
<p>Bettors who take those odds now would have quite a nice value should Brady decide to take his talents to Las Vegas. It would also drastically alter the Patriots’ current line of +1400 to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>Current champs Kansas City are the favorites for next February’s big game at +650. The Baltimore Ravens are next at +700, and San Francisco 49ers third at +900.</p>
