    <h1>Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Pulze Online Casino Pa Hollywood Casino Ha</h1>

<p>I have been requesting the withdrawal of a profit that I had for days, it is not a great profit (123 PEN / 33 USD) but for me it is something that can help me, first they asked me to generate a minimum deposit to be able to request it in that aspect, I agreed, I deposited, I played double the deposited amount since that is what they asked me for and finally I managed to be in the amount, then I uploaded what they asked me to the profile under the KYC verification, after a few days I see that my withdrawal was canceled and that I verification had not passed, I resent a photo of my ID (National Identity Document) photo with my ID in selfie, receipt of services, and photo of my debit card and even in selfie, I request my withdrawal again and they reject me again my withdrawal and my KYC verification, I contacted support and they told me that the photo did not look good, I took some photos again with a more powerful cell phone and uploaded my information again, for this everything already seemed strange to me, after days I verify that my account It was already verified, I requested my withdrawal and again they reject it indicating that I send them a photo of my account statement or my card, when the photo of my card had already been sent, so I chose to send photos of my statement of account, today being 03/21/2023 I try to enter my account and I get an error indicating that my account was blocked, consult support and they tell me that the reason is that I have another account with my data, but I had never tried this casino, firstly because I only use a cell phone number and they ask for it for registration verification, the operator that answered me never gave me a solution, I complained and complained and I never had any solution, so finally they have stayed With my earnings and my deposit, I hope that under this form I can resolve myself and be able to obtain my earnings.</p>
