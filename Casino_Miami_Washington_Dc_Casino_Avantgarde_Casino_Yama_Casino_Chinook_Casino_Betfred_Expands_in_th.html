<p>COO Bryan Bennett believes this is the perfect time to launch sports wagering in the state, considering all upcoming events</p>
<p>Sports betting operator Betfred has entered Virginia, further expanding its US footprint. The operator’s sports betting products are now available in several states, with the company now preparing to launch retail operations in Nevada.</p>
<p>Betfred Enters Virginia</p>
<p>The Virginia entry is a major development for the company, which has been steadily expanding its US reach. The launch of the sportsbook in Virginia was welcomed by the company’s chief operating officer, Bryan Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett said that his team cannot wait to begin operating online sports wagering in the Commonwealth and is looking forward to activating its partnership with Loudoun United.</p>
<p>The agreement in question was announced in December 2022, when Betfred USA Sports was designated as the official sports betting partner of the American soccer franchise. Under the deal with the team, Betfred’s branding will be promoted on the back of Loudoun United players’ jerseys throughout the 2023 season.</p>
<p>Betfred’s Bennett concluded that this is a perfect time to launch sports betting because of the many upcoming sporting events.</p>
<p>This is the ideal time to launch sports betting with several major sporting events happening over the coming weeks and months, and of course, with the USL Championship season kicking off soon. Bryan Bennett, COO, Betfred</p>
<p>The agreement with a notable sports team will help Betfred’s content gain traction in the Old Dominion. It echoes a recent development involving bet365, which employed a similar tactic during its own launch in the state. The competitor brand made its foray into Virginia yesterday and was named the official betting partner of the Washington Commanders.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Betfred just penned an agreement with the Vegas Golden Knights, a National Hockey League franchise based in Nevada. Betfred will sponsor the club, which will, in turn, promote the sports betting operator across its stadium.</p>
<p>The agreement celebrates Betfred’s entry to the state as the company prepares to launch a sportsbook in collaboration with Mohegan Casino Las Vegas. The new venue will be located at Mohegan’s Sun Casino at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas and is expected to be equipped with 80-inch screens, broadcasting sports in high-quality. The sportsbook will have a total area of 1,269 square feet and will be able to accommodate as many as a hundred fans of sports.</p>
<p>The company’s foray into the Silver State came just as the brand was recommended for a sports betting license. The Nevada Gaming Control Board thoroughly questioned the company about its intentions and vision for operations in the state.</p>
