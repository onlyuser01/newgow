    <h1>Casina Casino Guide Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Resort Casino Jumba Casino Black Hawk Casino AGA</h1>

<p>September is the Responsible Gaming Education Month (RGEM) and the gaming industry’s trade body, the American Gaming Association (AGA), commenced it by introducing a new edition of its Responsible Gaming Statutes and Regulations Guide.</p>
<p>Valuable Resource to Maintain Industry’s High Standards</p>
<p>A centralized collection of all statutes and regulations related to responsible gaming across commercial casinos, sports betting and online casino in all 34 states and D.C., the new edition of the Responsible Gaming Statutes and Regulations Guide is its first update since 2019.</p>
<p>Cait DeBaun, vice president of Strategic Communications and Responsibility at AGA, underlined the strategic meaning behind the guide that is considered to be a valuable resource to help the industry “maintain its high standards of regulatory compliance in all facets of responsible gaming.”</p>
<p>DeBaun also appreciated the continuous efforts of all AGA members to “go above and beyond” what the industry requires from them in terms of their responsibility commitments.</p>
<p>Since the guide’s last edition in 2019, the industry has grown exponentially as two new states have legalized land-based casinos, 16 states authorized sports betting and two states have legalized online casino gaming.</p>
<p>“Our industry’s focus on responsibility has only grown with the expansion of legal gaming,” added DeBaun, highlighting the extended opportunity brought up by RGEM 2022 to affirm the “industry’s responsible leadership” and continue to “strengthen player and employee education,” eager to see the “entire US gaming community” join the efforts throughout the month.</p>
<p>Responsible Play, Protection, Gaming, and Technology</p>
<p>Expanded for the first time from a responsible gaming education week to a month, the RGEM 2022 coincided with the new edition of the guide. To highlight the industry’s commitment to responsible gaming, the RGEM is organized around four weekly themes, including Empowering Customers to Play Responsibly, Legal, Regulated Gaming Protects Players, Employees—the RG Front Line, and Advancing Responsible Gaming with Technology.</p>
<p>During the RGEM, AGA will host two webinars on September 15 and September 27 to address “the state of responsibility and player protection” and “advancing responsible gaming through collaboration and technology.”</p>
<p>Overall, AGA’s “Have a Game Plan. Bet Responsibly.” campaign will feature heavily during the RGEM 2022, leveraging knowledge, experience and expertise from leagues, teams, operators and other stakeholders to deliver education on responsible wagering for consumers in a continually growing sports betting market.</p>
<p>Earlier in August, AGA released its commercial gaming revenue report for the second quarter of 2022 and revealed that during the quarter the industry generated $14.8 billion in revenue to set an all-time quarterly high.</p>
