    <h1>Horseshoe Hammond Casino Mountaineer Casino West Virginia Chumash Casino Hotel Black Lotus Casino Bo</h1>

<p>I can only recommend changing all your passwords to much stronger ones not just for the casino account, but for your emails as well, and if possible to set up a 2 phase verification for the added security.</p>
<p>This withdrawal was requested by someone that was logged in as you in your account and from the evidence we have, it looks like it was either you or someone who has access to your account. To keep your login information secure and don't share it with any third party is solely your responsibility. I'm sorry, but it looks like there is not much further we can do in this anymore.</p>
<p>I have received evidence from the casino. All the IP addresses and devices that have logged in roughly within withdrawal time on 13.1.2023 seem to be from the UK, but this is not 100% proof of course as the IPs can change from time to time. Regarding your response about this: "They ask for photo of debit card as proof it's yours,surely something should be in place". Yes, this is done for usual/normal payment methods. I'm not sure if this can be done for crypto payments. It does not have to be an account or wallet that is held in your own name. You have passed the KYC before, so the casino doesn't have to check this information with every withdrawal. According to the information from MyStake Casino the user is free to withdraw money to whatever address he chooses and the casino is unable to determine whether or not the user was the one who requested the withdrawal.</p>
