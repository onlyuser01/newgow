    <h1>Directions To San Manuel Casino Tropicana Online Casino Pa Thunder Valley Casino Resort 1200 Athens</h1>

<p>Put zero stars but they don't give you that option this casino sets you up to fail it sends you multiple emails on your same address email address the same promotions as when you signed up the kitchen if you win too big they can then at that time tell you you can't get your withdrawal of that big amount like mine was just them not even a month ago of $30,000 and all the sudden at the very last minute when I was supposed to wake up with money in my account I woke up to a email stating from the risk management team stating that I was abusing their promotions and had multiple accounts to abuse them and I could not get my withdrawal which was a total BS reason because they're the ones for years I've been with this casino I have three or four to four other emails and I can prove to you that they not only know that they you're giving you multiple accounts if you win big they use the excuse that you're abusing their promotions with multiple accounts so you get no money from your withdrawal and send you a little tiny amount to kind of push you out of the way and hope that you forget about it I got $71 I had a total withdrawal with different withdrawal slips I have all the pictures and all the downloads I can show you of everything so I have all the proof that what they're doing is wrong and they're just ripping people off by doing whatever with the winnings but somebody in that casino is really not doing a good thing and ripping off low income people that you know that money would have really helped and messing around for it when they want it fair and square not on their promotional money on your own deposited money just is wrong and what they're doing is wrong and I have proof of all of it don't use this casino I don't recommend it they just targeting Canadians to get them to play their games just to get ripped off in the end what are they doing with the rest of the 30 grand out of the 71 that ever make you wonder it makes me wonder and I'm just not going to just swipe it off I'm sorry I know this is wrong you can't hustle a hustler</p>
