<p>Poll Finds Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe Could Beat President Donald Trump in 2020, Political Odds Say Otherwise</p>

<p>Megan Rapinoe, the co-captain of the US Women’s National Team that won the World Cup last Sunday, is polling dead even with President Donald Trump for the 2020 election in a hypothetical survey.</p>

<p>A sampling of likely voters asking who they would pick in a general election showdown between Trump and the controversial soccer star found that 42 percent chose Rapinoe, and 41 percent the president. Seventeen percent weren’t sure.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by Public Policy Polling in North Carolina. It’s worth noting the results are within the margin of error, meaning Trump could still beat the 34-year-old he’s become embattled with via social media.</p>
<p>Rapinoe – a lesbian and outspoken critic of Trump – gave an impassioned speech about equality yesterday during her team’s championship parade in New York City. “This is my charge to everyone, we have to be better,” Rapinoe said. “We have to love more, hate less. We got to listen more and talk less.”</p>
<p>She ended, “New York City, you’re the mother**cking best!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Rapinoe has used vulgar language. Asked prior to her team’s World Cup win if she’d accept a White House invite from the president, she answered, “I’m not going to the f*cking White House.”</p>
<p>Polls or Odds</p>
<p>Though the Public Policy Polling results hint the soccer star could have a shot at winning the White House in a one-on-one scenario against Trump, political betting markets couldn’t disagree more. And in 2016, the betting markets proved much more accurate than the polls.</p>
<p>PredictIt – the online exchange that allows users to buy and sell shares of political outcomes – doesn’t even have Rapinoe as an option for either the 2020 Democratic ticket or the general election.</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks do, but Rapinoe is listed at +30000 to win the White House next November at Bovada. Those odds imply a chance of 0.33 percent, with a $10 bet netting $3,000 should the soccer player become commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>However, Rapinoe’s odds aren’t as long as some other celebrities some Americans would like to see replace Trump. A few notables include Chelsea Clinton, Ivanka Trump, George Clooney, Tom Brady, and Will Smith – all at +100000. If any of those names end up inhabiting 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and a bettor risks just $10, the gamble would net $10,000.</p>
<p>2020 Favorites</p>
<p>Trump is the favorite to win the 2020 election, with his reelection chances at even money. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) is next at +450, and former VP Joe Biden third at +600.</p>
<p>However, once the Democratic nominee is found, bettors believe there’s a slightly better chance whoever that person is will become the November frontrunner.</p>
<p>The odds are currently Democratic Party -120, to Republican Party -110. PredictIt’s market asking which party will win in 2020 has Democratic shares at 55 cents, and GOP shares at 47 cents.</p>
