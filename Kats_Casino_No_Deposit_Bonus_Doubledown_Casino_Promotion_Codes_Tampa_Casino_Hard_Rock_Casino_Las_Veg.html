<p>The National Football League (NFL) has struck a curious partnership with a game developer. The NFL is now in going to be one of the main themes in the popular battle royale game Fortnite.</p>
<p>NFL and Epic Games Draw Closer to Each Other</p>
<p>NFL has been looking for a way to examine new lucrative segments for a while now. The U.S. most-watched sport is now being doted on by Epic Games, the successful developers of Fortnite, a popular “battle royale” game.</p>
<p>As a result, Fortnite players can use NFL team outfits purchasing the goods from the in-game shop available in the game. The measure will be introduced on November 9, 2019. Fortnite will allow players to customize their NFL attires, from tinkering with the jersey to choosing a helmet for their players.</p>
<p>The merchandise will be available at a reasonable price either by paying between $12 and $15 for outfits or using the in-game currency known as V-Bucks to settle a transaction.</p>
<p>We’re teaming up with the @NFL to bring you some fresh Outfits! Available in-game on Nov 9 at 7pm ET. Get more info in our blog here: https://t.co/YqAyjwmX4i — Fortnite (@FortniteGame) November 5, 2018</p>
<p>There will be some interesting cross-team customization, allowing you to pick different items from different teams’ suits. The uniforms will also apply to both male and female characters. You can quickly change any aspect of the outfit that you don’t like either.</p>
<p>That is actually very exciting for us, with the avatars being available as females and being able to have females in NFL uniforms for the first time.</p>
<p>NFL seemed to be fully pleased with the latest partnership, as NFL’s Vice President and Head of Gaming and Esports Rachel Hoagland expressed her satisfaction with the League’s decision to embrace the popular video game.</p>
<p>While Fortnite will allow players to tinker with certain aspects of the suits, no-one will be allowed to actually display their name on the back of a jersey or that of an actual NFL player’s name for that matter.</p>
<p>The NFL will seek to top off the experience by allowing players to choose from an array of emoticons connected to football and players may stumble across the occasional extra goodie. Gamers will be introduced to other different forms of in-game treats, such as referee outfits.</p>
<p>Commenting on mixing the NFL and Fortnite culture, Hoagland suggested that it was a way to engage gamers with pop culture.</p>
<p>It’s just a way to bring some fun and some pop culture relevance to the game</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the NFL has sought to collaborate with a gaming producer, though the league has kept mostly outside of the noise around electronic sports.</p>
<p>Epic Games said that a lot of their players are actually NFL fans themselves and allowing the sporting organization and the game developer to work closely on something that will raise awareness about their respective brands but also be well-received in the communities.</p>
<p>Allowing our players to represent their favorite teams in the game was too cool of an opportunity for us to pass up, and we couldn’t be happier with how they turned out!</p>
<p>According to Hoagland, at long last, NFL fans will have an outlet for their favorite sports within the massive hit that is Epic Games’ Fortnite.</p>
