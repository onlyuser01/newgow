    <h1>Palace Casino Tuscany Suites Casinos Las Vegas Nv Charlestown Racetrack And Casino Seneca Resort And</h1>

<p>I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>We offer a self-exclusion facility to help you if you feel that your gambling is out of control and you want assistance to help stop. At your request, we will prevent you from using your account for a specific period, as determined by you. We will also take reasonable steps to prevent the opening of new accounts. Once the period has lapsed, your account will be reopened.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the automated process yourself, then you must contact Customer Support and request that they apply the self-exclusion for you and that you attempted the automated process and that you want us to manually self-exclude you – please note that if you request assistance via email to self-exclude that this will not be instantaneous, and we will confirm once it has been done. Unless you state otherwise, the self-exclusion period will be set at six months. To initiate self-exclusion please click here. If you have any questions, then please contact Customer Support."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to support@dreamvegas.com. In this way, you’ll have proof of such action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
