<p>On Monday, Icahn Enterprises announced it is selling Tropicana Entertainment and six of its eight casinos to real estate investment trust Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLP) in a transaction totaled at $1.85 billion.</p>
<p>GLP is paying Icahn $1.21 billion, and Reno-based Eldorado Resorts will take over the leases of the resorts and pay $640 million.</p>
<p>Icahn praised his company for saving Tropicana Entertainment, which it acquired a majority stake in a decade ago in 2008.</p>
<p>“Tropicana was bankrupt and desperately needed new leadership. By hiring a great CEO … and a great management team, and by reinvesting every single penny of profits back into the company, we turned Tropicana into a great casino company,” the billionaire declared.</p>
<p>Tropicana Entertainment owns and operates eight casinos in Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Missouri, New Jersey, and Aruba.</p>
<p>This week’s deal doesn’t include the company’s casino resort in Aruba, nor the closed former Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. Icahn said those two properties will be sold at a later date.</p>
<p>Tropicana Las Vegas is also not part of the deal, as the Strip resort is owned by Penn National Gaming.</p>
<p>Icahn Exits Casinos</p>
<p>Carl Icahn is known as a corporate raider who buys struggling businesses at deep discounts and later sells them for massive profits. Though he took a loss on his ownership of the former Trump Taj Mahal, which he says cost him hundreds of millions of dollars, he won the jackpot in Las Vegas last year.</p>
<p>In August, Icahn’s company sold what was to be the Fontainebleau on the Las Vegas Strip to New York real estate company Witkoff for $600 million. Icahn said the deal netted his shareholders $457 million.</p>
<p>Icahn acquired Fontainebleau in early 2010 in bankruptcy court for $150 million. The investor apparently had little interest in finishing the megaresort, which has sat roughly 70 percent complete for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>In 2008, Icahn made about a billion dollars when he sold his stake in American Casino &amp; Entertainment Properties. He had acquired the parent company to the Stratosphere and Arizona Charlie’s locations in 1998 for $300 million, and sold the entity a decade later to a mutual fund for $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>When the Tropicana casinos all formally sold, Icahn will not have a functioning casino in his portfolio for the first time in more than two decades.</p>
<p>Quality Properties</p>
<p>Eldorado Resorts will add 7,900 slot machines, 265 table games, and 5,400 hotel rooms to its operations by acquiring the Tropicana Entertainment gaming rights.</p>
<p>Eldorado already has 20 casinos in 10 states. With Tropicana Entertainment, it will be a dozen with the company’s entry into New Jersey and Indiana.</p>
<p>Eldorado CEO Gary Carano said the Tropicana casinos are largely in good shape, and the company has no immediate plans to invest in any renovations or expansions.</p>
