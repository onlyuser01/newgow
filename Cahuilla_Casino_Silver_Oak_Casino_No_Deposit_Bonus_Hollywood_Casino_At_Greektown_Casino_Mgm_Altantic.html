<p>Online casino aggregator Pariplay is now legally allowed to partner with iGaming operators in Connecticut following its approval as a supplier in the state, announced Pariplay parent NeoGames.</p>
<p>Live in Five out of Six iGaming States</p>
<p>NeoGames’ subsidiary Pariplay received its Online Gaming Service Provider and Gaming Registration Exemption provided by the State of Connecticut, as well as its Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation (Connecticut) license to make the Constitution State the fifth US gaming jurisdiction to authorize operations of the aggregation platform owned by the provider of end-to-end iLottery and iGaming solutions.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have gained our Connecticut license, which is our fifth awarded to Pariplay in the United States,” said chief executive officer of NeoGames Moti Malul, hailing the company’s “bold approach to entering regulated markets” as the main driver for the business to continue to excel.</p>
<p>Following the approval, Pariplay will be able to legally provide operators in Connecticut with access to more than 14,000 game titles supplied by over 80 game developer studios via its Fusion platform.</p>
<p>On top of the localized gaming content, operators will also be able to benefit from a suite of expertly designed gamification and player retention tools in the state that has more than 3 million residents.</p>
<p>Commenting on the expansion to the Constitution State, head of Compliance at Pariplay, Lawrence Hanlin, outlined the opportunities presented before the business “to make real impact for operators and partners alike” alongside the continuous expansion of online casino gaming regulation in the US.</p>
<p>“Connecticut marks an important milestone for us in our quest to be the leading aggregator across the States,” Hanlin continued, proud to help the business position itself to benefit from the legalization by being “live in five of the six markets which allow for online slot gaming.”</p>
<p>Connecticut became the fifth US state to allow Pariplay operations, following previous approvals obtained in Pennsylvania, Michigan, West Virginia, and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The aggregation platform is also live in two Canadian provinces, Alberta and Ontario, and will become operational in five other provinces soon.</p>
<p>Latin American Expansion Also Underway</p>
<p>Alongside its expansion in the US, Pariplay continued to strengthen its position in Latin American markets where the aggregation platform received two licenses to offer gaming content last month.</p>
<p>First, Pariplay was permitted by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, an independent online gaming jurisdiction in Argentina, to offer its content and aggregation solution to local gaming license holders in the city boasting 3 million people.</p>
<p>Later in September, Pariplay received a license from the Panama Gaming Control Board to offer its games and platform to local operators and continue its expansion in the region.</p>
