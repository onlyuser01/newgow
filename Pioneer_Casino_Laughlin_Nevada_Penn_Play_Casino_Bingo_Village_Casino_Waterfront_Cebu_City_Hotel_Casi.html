<p>Kalamba Games is taking another important swing at the European market, which has become the company’s ground base of operations, with Sweden next on the horizon for the acclaimed developer of iGaming products.</p>
<p>Handpicked Products by Kalamba Enter the Market</p>
<p>Kalamba will be bringing its portfolio of slot titles as the company prepares to take on another regulated jurisdiction and one of the strongest markets in Europe. The supplier is introducing its signature products, to name Griffin’s Quest, Burning Diamonds and Atlantis Thunder in pursuit of a higher customer satisfaction and immaculate delivery across the board.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new market entry, Kalamba Games co-founder and COO Alex Cohen said that the company was pleased to be breaking ground into yet another market, and added:</p>
<p>“It’s a further step for our growth ambitions and a fantastic shop window for the high quality, diverse range of games that we produce. It’s a great way to begin rounding off a busy year for new partnerships and territories and we’re looking forward to continuing in a similar vein in 2022.”</p>
<p>Kalamba is similarly adding its Joker series, capping the number of titles ready for distribution in Sweden to nine. The company has tested its titles across Europe and decided to use those select games to pivot towards the Swedish market.</p>
<p>Kalamba Keeps on Building up Its Momentum</p>
<p>As it turns out, iGaming continues to lead the way in Sweden in terms of overall gambling revenue. Kalamba has several high-profile market entries over the last months, with the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Croatia and now Sweden all authorized markets in Europe.</p>
<p>The company also received a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), giving the company additional strength and reach. To inject quick delivery, Kalamba uses its proprietary distribution platform, Bullseye RGS and collaborates with aggregators to make its product portfolio accessible to over 400 operators.</p>
