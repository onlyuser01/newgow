    <h1>San Diego Casinos Jumer S Hotel Casino Silver Legacy Casino Casino Casinos Near Me Four Queens Casin</h1>

<p>Last night I deposited $150 I played through a few games geting my balance up over $1000 then back down to $740 before starting to play buffalo power 2 from playson, which is my favourite game, I spent just over an hour and managed to bring my balance up to roughly (over) $2500 the game stopped paying as well and I thought I should really withdraw so I hit the return to lobby button, when I was redirected to the lobby I had to sign back in (this has happened before so didn’t think much of it) once signed in my balance was $741.04, I closed the browser signed back in and same thing, I then clicked into another game (lion gem) a placed one bet to see if maybe it would click the balance back over and it didn’t, I contacted support and I got told I never played the game, I screen shot my internet history and there it is inbetween the last game they say they can see me playing and lion gems, buffalo power 2, I sent it through and they ignored it, they told me to look at my activity transactions and that was showing no data so I screenshot that as well and they ignored that to and just kept telling me I hadn’t played the game and there was no missing winning’s, so I emailed them and was like I’m not happy with that response here is my evidence, here’s what happened, explain to me what happened, can I see the transcripts from your side and I just keep getting told I have no missing winnings and they are now ignoring my emails, I’m at the point I just want to know what happened and why they won’t answer any of my questions, the person I’m emailing with stated it wasn’t a game malfunction so if it didn’t malfunction where are my winnings? Why do I keep getting dismissed and told there are no winnings? And why is everything I’m showing them are saying to them being ignored? It feels super dodgy to me, my wife who even saw me playing buffalo power thinks they have deleted the data or something</p>
<p>i made sure to withdraw the $741.04 but to just simply loose the amount I did is actually heartbreaking</p>
