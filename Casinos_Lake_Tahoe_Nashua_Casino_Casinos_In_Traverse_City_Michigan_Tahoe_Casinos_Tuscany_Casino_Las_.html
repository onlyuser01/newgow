<p>Huddle, a next-generation iGaming technology company, has entered into a fresh partnership with Genius Sports, which will establish it as an official data partner</p>
<p>As a result of this collaboration, Huddle will gain immediate access to a host of tools and features developed by Genius Sports, including the LiveData, Next Gen Stats and PreMatch solutions which deliver feeds in real-time and help provide accurate pricing.</p>
<p>Huddle Leverages Live Feeds to Strengthen Machine Learning Algorithms</p>
<p>Thanks to Genius Sports’ advanced feeds, Huddle will be able to further streamline and hone its pricing algorithm that is used to track sports in the United States. Huddle will leverage its own machine learning models to better its overall coverage and pricing of US sports and pave the way to innovative solutions for the entire industry.</p>
<p>Huddle will further benefit from the opportunity to tap into official NFL data and products and deliver a stronger fan-focused betting experience and markets such as same-game parlays, micro markets, derivatives, player props, and others. These markets, Huddle assures, all come with industry-leading uptime.</p>
<p>Genius Sports will also deploy its AI-driven pricing models that help with betting markets across a fleet of sports, including the NCAAF, NCAAB, CFL and NASCAR. Through this collaboration, Huddle hopes to shape itself into the leading marketplace for US sports and provide partners with a comprehensive market offering.</p>
<p>Genius Sports and Huddle Both Happy with the Opportunity</p>
<p>Huddle CEO and co-founder Francesco Borgosano has welcomed the opportunity to team up with Genius Sports and continue to deploy products that focus on still untapped veins in the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>“The industry needs innovative, engaging products that are easy and entertaining for the users,” Borgosano assured, and added that the two companies set to benefit from the partnership. It’s a combination of algorithmic solutions that lead to the necessary product innovation, Borgosano remarked.</p>
<p>He overall called the opportunity to establish a partnership with Genius Sports an amazing opportunity and one that would continue to pay off in the future. Huddle is also one of the companies to have been targeted by Las Vegas Sands, a land-based casino resorts expert, in an investment round, marking the behemoth’s first forays into the interactive gaming and betting space.</p>
