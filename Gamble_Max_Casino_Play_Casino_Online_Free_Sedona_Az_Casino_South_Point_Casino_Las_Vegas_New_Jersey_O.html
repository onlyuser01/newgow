<p>Sports data specialist IMG ARENA released a new announcement, sharing that it secured streaming rights for the top two soccer divisions in Norway. As a result, the company will be able to provide betting-oriented broadcasts from the two leagues, expanding its content portfolio.</p>
<p>IMG Expands Its Sports Portfolio</p>
<p>Under the agreement, IMG ARENA is now in possession of global betting streaming rights for the Eliteserien and OBOS-Ligaen divisions, excluding Norway. Per the deal, the sports data company will get access to a total of 485 matches across the two leagues.</p>
<p>IMG Arena noted that matches in Norway are usually played between April and November, with fixtures often taking place on Sunday evenings. Each of the two competitions features 16 teams. In addition, the Eliteserien provides the best-performing teams with a shot at the famous UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>This agreement will greatly expand IMG ARENA’s European content, adding to its global soccer portfolio. The company is looking forward to boosting its weekly and year-round offerings, allowing it to provide its betting partners with more matches.</p>
<p>IMG Is Committed to Supplying Operators with the Best Products</p>
<p>Knut Kristvang, the chief executive officer of Fotball Media, commented on the agreement, sharing that he is very happy about the agreement with IMG ARENA. He noted that this multi-year agreement will allow Fotball Media to significantly grow the Eliteserien and OBOS-Ligaen divisions, helping them reach many soccer fans all over the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mark Wrigley, IMG ARENA’s senior director of rights, said that the agreement with the Norwegian soccer leagues expands IMG ARENA with more products of quality. He is excited by the fact that the company’s partnering operators will be able to engage their customers with more soccer content.</p>
<p>This deal with Norwegian football bolsters IMG ARENA’s football offering with another first-class property that will help sports betting operators increase their engagement with players throughout the year, while also enabling new touch points during the week.

<p>In December, IMG ARENA announced its plans to acquire the virtual sports and casino provider Leap Gaming. This agreement is yet another way for IMG ARENA to expand its content portfolio and provide its clients with better products. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2023 and will see Leap Gaming and its team of 58 people join the IMG ARENA family.</p>
<p>Earlier that same month, PointsBet integrated IMG ARENA’s Golf Event Center into its app with the aim of delivering a better overall experience to golf fans and sports bettors.</p>
