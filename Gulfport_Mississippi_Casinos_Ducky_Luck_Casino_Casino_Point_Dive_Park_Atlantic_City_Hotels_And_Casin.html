    <h1>Gulfport Mississippi Casinos Ducky Luck Casino Casino Point Dive Park Atlantic City Hotels And Casin</h1>

<p>I made 4 withdrawal requests The first for $250, I had about $350 in my account and decided to request a withdrawal of $250 and keep $100 in the account so I could keep playing.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards with the $100 I had in the my account I won $2100 on Mochimon and then $1500 on Fire Strike 2, I cancelled the original $250 withdrawal request, because your only allowed to have 3 withdrawal requests at a time and a maximum of $1300 each. So after cancelling the $250, i made 3 different withdrawal requests for $1300 each.</p>
<p>I completed the KYC authentication after I made the withdrawal requests. I waited 2 days and hadn't heard anything from the casino, so I messaged there online chat, where I was told not to worry the withdrawal request will be processed shortly. I checked back later that day to find that all 3 of my requests had been cancelled, when i spoke with the online chat they said I must have cancelled them by accident, I told then I didn't any withdrawal request, let alone cancel 3 of them. They have to be cancelled 1 by 1, I couldn't do that by accident. They then told me to email kyc@rollino.co. I emailed them right afterwards.</p>
<p>I received a reply the next day asking for all my KYC information again, I told them I had already completed it through there website and then sent them a screenshot of the proof of completion. Regardless I sent them what they asked for, hoping to speed up the process. Then they emailed me back saying that they had deducted $3750 if the $3900 from my account due to it being won using free spins. This is a lie, my winnings were not won on free spins, and my winnings were won long after all of the wagering requirements were met.</p>
