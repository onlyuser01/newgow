<p>Rodolfo Vieira Is a Real BJJ Expert</p>
<p>Before starting his professional career in the world of mixed martial arts (MMA), Rodolfo Vieira was an accomplished Brazilian jiu-jitsu athlete. In fact, he is a four-time BJJ world champion, who also won gold in Pan American Championships, European championships, Abu Dhabi World Pro competitions, and so on.</p>
<p>Obviously, considering that he’s a BJJ expert, it’s no surprise that Vieira has done great grappling-wise in the MMA universe. His professional MMA record is 8-2 and seven of those eight wins happened by submission.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that one of his two losses happened by this method. It happened in February 2021 when we saw him get submitted by Anthony Hernandez who used guillotine choke to finish Vieira.</p>
<p>The Brazilian, however, tapped only after getting beaten up real bad by his opponent. He just didn’t have any energy left in him to defend.</p>
<p>Cody Brundage Has All Sorts of Weapons on Him</p>
<p>The key to beating Vieira isn’t to try and outgrapple him. Instead, it’s to try to hit him as much as you can and as hardest you can. Only when he’s gassed out can Vieira be defeated. That’s how Hernandez got to him and that’s what we’ll probably see Cody Brundage attempt on Saturday.</p>
<p>The good news for Brundage is that he definitely has the needed set of skills to hurt Vieira. He’s a BJJ black belt who lands 2.34 significant strikes per minute, which isn’t as good as Vieira (3.62).</p>
<p>However, Brundage is much better at dodging strikes. He absorbs only 2.88 strikes per minute, which is almost two times less than his opponent who gets hit 5.09 times a minute.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Vieira vs Cody Brundage Prediction</p>
<p>Rodolfo Vieira is coming off a loss to Chris Curtis in which the American fighter outboxed him. It happened in June 2022, and we’re certain that has worked hard to improve his striking/strike avoidance. That said, he should be able to put on a good show against Brundage.</p>
<p>We expect to see a boxing fight at the beginning, but once the two are gassed out, we could see the fight going to the floor. And that’s where Vieira feels the most comfortable. If we were to guess, our prediction would be a late win for the Brazilian via arm-triangle choke.</p>
<p>Pick: Rodolfo Vieira to win by submission</p>
