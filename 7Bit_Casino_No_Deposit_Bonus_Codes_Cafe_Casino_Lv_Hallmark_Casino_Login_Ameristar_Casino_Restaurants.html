    <h1>7Bit Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Cafe Casino Lv Hallmark Casino Login Ameristar Casino Restaurants</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>really hoping to get some help here ðŸ˜•</p>
<p>This is my second withdrawal request with sunrise slots. The first was on 10/23/23 using their "coindraw method" and the process wasnâ€™t a problem. I received payout within a few days.</p>
<p>I made my second withdrawal request on 11/1/23 but this time the "coindraw" option was not available for whatever reason. (They said itâ€™s random when itâ€™s available or notâ€¦) so they told me the bitcoin withdrawal was the next quickest option. My deposit was made using bitcoin also. Per their terms: it takes 7-10 business days to review/ approve. And then another 7-10 business days to pay. My withdrawal (after being "escalated" twice) was not approved until 11/22/23. The approval was over the 7-10 business days so I of course had a feeling it would be over the 7-10 business days to get paid as well. I was told my payout would be sent by 12/6/23 and it was not. It was escalated and I was told to check back on 12/8/23 and I did. Nothing- they escalated again. I have been checking in with their customer support on the chat every other day and I keep getting told itâ€™s escalated and to wait a few days for it to be reviewed. I have been told this over and over for weeks. We are now 19 business days past the day it was approved and almost 2 months past the day it was first requested. I canâ€™t get a straight answer on when I will be paid and I keep getting lied to about when it will be done. I have a LOT of screen shots from conversations with customer support. This is my second withdrawal so all documents of mine are approved- I asked multiple times making sure itâ€™s nothing on my end and they said they have everything needed and approved. Just waiting for them to send the money.</p>
<p>If my first withdrawal only took a few days then this one should NOT take 2 months. I know the coindraw and bitcoin withdrawal methods are different but if bitcoin is instant to deposit then it should also be instant to withdrawal (like most online casinos). I know there have been a lot of similar complaints but I would really appreciate any and all help! Thanks in advance!</p>
