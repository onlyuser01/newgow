<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) continues to champion responsible gambling through its dedicated initiative known simply as “Have A Game Plan,” now backed by MGM Resorts and BetMGM. The partnership was revealed during AGA’s Responsible Gaming Education Week or RGEW for shore.</p>
<p>Helping Gamblers Understand Safer Gambling</p>
<p>This campaign focuses on educating crowds about sports betting as the US embraces legalized gambling at a break-neck pace and will help both new players as well as experienced veterans.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM will be able to amplify AGA’s responsible gambling message and deliver it to more customers across the US, as the operators are some of the biggest market shareholders in terms of sports gambling and interactive casinos, as well as retail operations.</p>
<p>The AGA’s campaign coincides with MGM Resorts’ proprietary GameSense program, which focuses on educating gamers on what safe and transparent gambling practices are. The GameSense initiative seeks a more proactive approach where it talks to gamblers and educates them on how to follow safe gambling practices.</p>
<p>Commenting on the tie-up between the companies and the trade group, MGM resorts responsible gaming compliance manager Garrett Farnes stated, “This partnership complements our ongoing commitment to GameSense. GameSense has been an instrumental part of the MGM Resorts guest service model since 2017, helping customers understand the risks, where to get help, and ultimately, how to keep gaming fun.”</p>
<p>Guaranteeing the Sustainability of Gambling in the USA</p>
<p>BetMGM’s own responsible gambling program head, Richard Taylor, welcomed the opportunity and said that he was happy to be a part of what is a pivotal initiative for the industry. Responsible gambling is a pillar of sustainability when it comes to gambling in the US, as it allows avoiding future issues that stem from excessive participation in gambling products.</p>
<p>GameSense is all about creating a fun and safe experience, Taylor added. Responsible gambling has been one of the pivots for AGA since the mass legalization of sports gambling in 2018.</p>
<p>The program’s partners now include a number of established partners. Originally launched in 2019, Have A Game Plan now reunites prominent sports bodies and industry operators such as Entain, DraftKings, NASCAR, the Washington Football Team, the Vegas Golden Knight, UFC and others.</p>
