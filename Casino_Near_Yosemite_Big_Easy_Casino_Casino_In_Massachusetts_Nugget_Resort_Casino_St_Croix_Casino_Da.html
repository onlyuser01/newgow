<p>Sports betting and customer engagement solution startup Kero Gaming announced that it had secured $2 million in extra capital from strategic investment company Happyhour.io. Kero plans to use the funds to bolster its signature sportsbook product and continue refining its vision.</p>
<p>Kero Offers a Modern Approach to Wagering</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Kero Gaming has set out to develop an innovative, customer-oriented product focused on maximizing player entertainment. Their platform draws inspiration from casino games, employing a playstyle based on Tik-Tok’s reliance on instant gratification. Kero’s offering focuses on frequent, real-time micro bets engineered to capture individual moments of excitement through a game.</p>
<p>Kero Gaming founder and CEO Tomash Devenishek noted that the modern audience rarely had the time or patience to sort through spreadsheets and calculate odds, so the company’s solution focuses on engagement rather than risk. Devenishek expressed excitement that investors continued recognizing Kero’s innovative approach and promised to meet their expectations. Thanks to the new $2 million investment by HappyHour, his vision is one step closer to reality.</p>
<p>We were able to surpass our fundraising ambitions thanks to great strategic partners, all of whom add value beyond capital. Tomash Devenishek, Kero Gaming founder and CEO</p>
<p>The company’s modern approach has managed to draw significant investor attention. Last month, Kero Gaming won the top prize at the SBC Summit Barcelona First Pitch. The judges recognized it as one of the most promising sports betting startups, boosting the brand with an award package worth over $49,000.</p>
<p>The Startup Must Meet High Expectations</p>
<p>Many high-profile investors have placed their trust in Kero’s ambitious vision. HappyHour CEO Robin Reed lauded the startup’s talented team, noting the company’s potential to transform the sportsbook market.</p>
<p>As a strategic investor…, HappyHour is looking forward to working with Tomash and his team to bring this technology to casual bettors around the world. Robin Reed, HappyHour CEO</p>
<p>Yolo Investments and Acies Investments, two other companies supporting Kero’s progress, also reflected positively on the developer’s dedication to innovation, stating that they would help introduce its product to a global audience. Recognizing micro-betting’s potential to transform the sports betting market, the two investors predicted a new wave of sportsbook growth, hopefully with Kero at the forefront.</p>
<p>Kero has the vision and capability to radically transform how fans engage and participate in sports entertainment. Edward King, Acies Investments co-founder</p>
<p>With such high expectations, Kero is under substantial pressure to perform well after releasing its sportsbook product. The company currently engages with teams across all US major leagues to power their free-to-play apps and bolster fan engagement, which should provide them with much-needed experience to refine its upcoming platform. With the most recent HappyHour funding round, Kero has sufficient capital to power its ambitions of spearheading the imminent sports betting revolution.</p>
