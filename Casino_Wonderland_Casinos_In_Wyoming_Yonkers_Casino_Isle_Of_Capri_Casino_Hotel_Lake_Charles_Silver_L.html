    <h1>Casino Wonderland Casinos In Wyoming Yonkers Casino Isle Of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles Silver L</h1>

<p>Calder Casino in Miami, Florida, a property owned by Churchill Downs Incorporated, has restarted operations. The Miami-Dade County is now reopening businesses.</p>
<p>CDI Restarts Operations in Calder Casino, Miami</p>
<p>Following news that Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) would need to cut live attendance at the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, September 5, the company finally has some good news. CDI has restarted operations at its Calder Casino in Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>The property had to remain shut for five months as part of the state’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The property opened on August 31 and it will stick to Miami-Dade County health and safety guidelines.</p>
<p>Calder Casino will have to stick to a new, revised working schedule and reduce the services available to consumers. As the property is restarting operations, CDI is introducing the “CDI 360-Degree Approach to Safety,” the company’s initiative to enforce easy-to-follow rules to uphold health and safety standards.</p>
<p>CDI will make it simple for visitors to keep social distancing, use personal protection and more. The property is rolling out enhanced cleaning protocols to ensure that the risk of infection is minimized.</p>
<p>According to the safety protocols, the property will have to increase the frequency of cleaning as well as sanitize all high-touch surfaces based on a new, more intense schedule. The casino is also adding plexiglass and polycarbonate dividers in high-traffic areas or where concentration of patrons is expected.</p>
<p>Calder to Operate to Enhanced Cleaning Protocols</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer dispensers will be readily available around the property and sanitary wipe stations will be available on the casino floor. To make it simpler for patrons to follow with the regulatory measures, the Calder Casino will use various visual aids.</p>
<p>CDI has also vowed to train all employees so that they are able to carry out the new measures in full and assist customers with observing safety protocols as well. CDI chief executive Bill Carstanjen had this to say:</p>
<p>“With the reopening of our Calder Casino, CDI will have all of our gaming properties back in operation across the country .We are grateful to our teams who have ensured smooth, safe and successful reopenings at our properties and to our returning guests who have enthusiastically adapted to new protocols.”</p>
<p>Restaurants have also been allowed to reopen and welcome guests back at 50% operational capacity. Mayor Carlos Gimenez did caution citizens that the pandemic was not gone, not “by a long shot,” Gimenez emphasized.</p>
<p>Loosening up of restrictions in South Florida was approved by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a bid to allow business to return to some form of normalcy. DeSantis did promise, though, that no further lockdowns would be imposed on Florida and the state would seek other ways to deal with the pandemic if the infection rates start climbing back up.</p>
