    <h1>Casino Guitar Silver Legacy Casino Reno Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City Casino Online For Real Mo</h1>

<p>I deposit ETransfer $50 and another $90 and this money went into their account directly. I waited for 1hour nothing was updated then i waited more and nothing so i looked on my bank and it said it was send so i contact their support line and wow they dont know where my money went. They ask for the reference number which i gave and they still cant find my money then they want my bank statement ???? WTF why? With the reference number they should be able to track my money so i provided them my bank statement but i blacked out everything that is not related and i only left where is said they took $50 and $90 and i even left money i received so they can see that i did not get it back. Then they wrote no u have to unblack the statement i said no that is personal my bank told me that is odd for them to even ask that and she said sounds like a scam and for me not to provide this. They can find it with the reference number my name or email. But no they want to see my whole bank statement. THEY SCAMMED ME BEWARE. This is such a headache but i will be fighting for what is mine.</p>
