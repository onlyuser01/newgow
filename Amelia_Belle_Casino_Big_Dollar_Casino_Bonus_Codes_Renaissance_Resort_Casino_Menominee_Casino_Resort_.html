<p>The new deal will see GRID power the company's esports fantasy solution by offering official esports data</p>
<p>The plug-and-play esports fantasy solution, Spectatr, announced it joined forces with the end-to-end in-game data solutions provider for competitive game publishers and esports companies, GRID. Under the terms of a new agreement, GRID agreed to power Spectatr’s global expansion by delivering official esports data to strengthen the solution’s esports fantasy offering.</p>
<p>Details regarding the new collaboration emerged Wednesday and see Spectatr become the latest partner of GRID. Currently, GRID is recognized around the globe for its capabilities to source and distribute live game data. The company’s operations power a wide range of providers and operators within the esports and sports vertical that benefit from official data.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Spectatr is a fast-growing fantasy solution from the largest esports fantasy platform in India, Fanclash. The recently founded solution that seeks to take the esports vertical by storm was backed last year with a $40 million investment from Alpha Wave Global, Info Edge, Sequoia Capital India, as well as Polygon.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recent collaboration, Spectatr will tap into official data from GRID. This will help the company deliver a supreme and entertaining esports fantasy experience for Indian fans. Ultimately, this new content agreement is expected to also propel the solution’s expansion into the business-to-business sector.</p>
<p>Back in July, GRID announced a similar deal with the Kambi Group-owned esports data and betting solutions provider, Abios. At the time, GRID agreed to power the company by providing data from its GRID Data Platform. Before that, GRID teamed up with US Integrity, the leading sports integrity services provider.</p>
<p>The Deal Brings Excitement to Spectatr and GRID</p>
<p>Mikael Westerling, GRID’s Chief Sales Officer, revealed that esports fantasy is one of the most popular and fast-growing esports betting forms around the world. He said: “Fanclash has developed an impressive live-esports fantasy offering over the last two years for which official esports data is critical to ensure the best fan experience.” Moreover, Westerling explained that GRID is excited to join forces with Spectatr and power its growth by delivering official live data.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Spectatr and power a global expansion of their state-of-the-art solution with our official live data.“ Mikael Westerling, chief sales officer of GRID</p>
<p>Rishabh Bhansali, Spectatr’s co-founder, was similarly delighted about the new agreement with GRID. He spoke about the continuous growth of the audience within the esports vertical and predicted that together with GRID, the company will deliver unrivaled betting experiences. Finally, Bhansali outlined that the collaboration will elevate the thrill and excitement esports audiences experience.</p>
