    <h1>Coos Bay Casino 7Bit Casino Free Chip Biggest Casino In America Hotel Morongo Casino Resort Free Cas</h1>

<p>I have been writing for support for many, many months and asking them to manage the technical issues and in this round it has only been 3 months and now 5 months where I have written for support Constant and they send me so many auto mail where they write that they are constantly writing to tec team but then nothing happens and i have so many pictures of all the errors and 5 months ago the tec team wrote that there were no errors with them, but what about all the pictures i have? I can't even make all the pictures that show all the mistakes but now the support supervisor has taken over and he writes god help me the same as support he writes we have escalated your concerns to our Technical Team it has support written for me for 5 months now .</p>
<p>I get nothing for my money when the games do not work properly at all I am often thrown out of a game and cannot enter the game again. I have sometimes received a message on the website that says: your country is blacklisted it they have removed it is the only thing that has happened and there are a lot of games I can not play because they can not be played from Denmark. They've got bad reviews on trust pilot is it a scam page? It's so frustrating and I mean I have the right to get some money back but they won't</p>
<p>I also received this message several times.</p>
<p>I would like to make my complaint public but how do I do it?</p>
