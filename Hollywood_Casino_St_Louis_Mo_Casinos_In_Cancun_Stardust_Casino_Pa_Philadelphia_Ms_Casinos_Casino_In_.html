    <h1>Hollywood Casino St Louis Mo Casinos In Cancun Stardust Casino Pa Philadelphia Ms Casinos Casino In</h1>

<p>Hello and healthy new</p>
<p>Thank you first for your feedback and excuse me for not responding.</p>
<p>So I've had regular inevitable contact with the casino over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>For a while it went back and forth because you always have 24 hours "time" to answer. Or the request expires after the 24 hours.</p>
<p>But I think after the last contact the fair was read, they checked everything again, etc. but there were no abnormalities to be seen !?</p>
<p>With ... of course ... the reference to the terms and conditions that the casino will free itself from if a third party misuses my data or drives my payment methods through my account etc.</p>
<p>I think everything is clear !!!!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot understand the course of the game myself ... For the following reasons.</p>
<p>-Played a lot on the day, as already mentioned, paid 315 euros and gambled</p>
<ul>
<li>from this it follows that you have to scroll very far to get to the point in time at all, which is also impossible because at some point the system seems to be overwhelmed and you either start again from above or if you click on something and maybe it is the wrong time ... you start up again.</li>
</ul>
<p>-this is simply better solved at other casinos eg. 888casino clearer and also feasible</p>
<p>The only thing I could capture with a screenshot are the deposits I made more or less.</p>
<p>There you can also see from when to when the debit was made which I did not make .... within half an hour 3 debits over 50 euros and 1 over 60 euros.</p>
<p>So 210 euros in half an hour in which I didn't play because I was on my way home from work. Fortunately, I immediately continued playing and deposited 100 euros and played until early in the morning. So no one could continue to debit since I was online myself.</p>
<p>But my playing behavior alone stands in the way of it. I play for small sums up to a maximum of 1 euro up to a maximum of 2 euros, but mostly less played a lot of games.</p>
<p>But to lose 210 euros in half an hour I would have noticed wink wink.</p>
<p>But as I said, I think there is little chance of success. The terms and conditions speak for themselves!</p>
<p>But what was still striking ... after the first live chat was very short and rough at the time.</p>
<p>The young lady from the second contact via the live chat had immediately after I asked if it was not possible to check from which IP address was debited (since it could not be mine) or was being played. She then immediately advised me to report to the police, etc. ... which is nice but is questionable because I theoretically make myself punishable for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts</p>
<p>But with vera and John I'm through !!!!</p>
<p>The next time I visit Malta I will pee on your mailbox :-)</p>
