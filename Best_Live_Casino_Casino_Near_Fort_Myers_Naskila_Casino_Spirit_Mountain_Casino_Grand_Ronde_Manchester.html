    <h1>Best Live Casino Casino Near Fort Myers Naskila Casino Spirit Mountain Casino Grand Ronde Manchester</h1>

<p>Dear Sohilshaikh51,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand, that we can’t penalize the casino for taking away your privilege receiving further bonuses. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://casino.betway.com/policies/bonus/:</p>
<p>"Advantage Play</p>
<p>We offer our valued customers promotions and bonuses to reward them. To enable us to continue offering these promotions, we have a zero tolerance policy on activity which is designed to take advantage of our offers in violation of these terms. If any bonus related advantage play occurs, we reserve the right to stop any further bonuses, promotions and/or offers and remove the bonus balance from these and/or linked accounts."</p>
<p>"Please also refer to Section 6 and 7 of the General Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Examples of advantage play include:</p>
<p>Using more than one account to claim multiple bonuses</p>
<p>Two tier betting (where large bets are placed on high variance outcomes, before switching to normal variance outcomes to clear wagering requirements)</p>
<p>Multiple account strategy / proxy account strategy</p>
<p>Bonus stacking (where multiple deposits to claim multiple bonuses, before original bonus wagering requirements are met)</p>
<p>Using a VPN or masking IP address</p>
<p>If you come through a URL indirectly (i.e. not through the intended source/third party) and therefore the relevant tracking is not in place you will not be eligible for the bonus</p>
<p>Artificially manipulating affiliate CPAs or revenue share</p>
<p>Decreasing your stake amount by 60% or more after a large win (5x value of your last deposit or more) for the purpose of clearing wagering requirements while a bonus is still active. E.g. Winning £/$/€100 on any spin including a double up and reducing your stake amount to £/$/€50 or less.</p>
<p>Moving from a low weighted game (25% wagering contribution or less) to a higher weighted contribution game (70% or more) after large wins for the purpose of clearing wagering requirements. For example, but not limited to placing bets on roulette and then after a win moving your game play to slots to clear wagering.</p>
<p>Where bonus funds are used by the customer to progress through the bonus stages/collectable features (i.e. collecting 9 out of 10 symbols to reach a bonus feature) and then return to the final stage to complete the collection feature with cash only bets, with the aim of returning associated winnings in cash only once bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering requirements have been met.</p>
<p>You place at least one bet on any game that has a weighting of 20% or less towards wagering, the resulting win is 100% more than the corresponding stake and you move your original stake and winnings to a game weighted at 100% in order to meet wagering requirements.</p>
<p>When playing with a no-deposit bonus in your account, if you bet more than 10% of the bonus amount in a single bet, spin or round, your bonus and winnings may be voided.</p>
<p>If you have arrived from a website which promotes gambling in a manner in violation of these terms."</p>
<p>I’m not claiming that you’ve abused your privilege in the past, only suggesting that it might be a possible reason. Could you please forward all the relevant communication between you and the casino to petronela.k@casino.guru? Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
