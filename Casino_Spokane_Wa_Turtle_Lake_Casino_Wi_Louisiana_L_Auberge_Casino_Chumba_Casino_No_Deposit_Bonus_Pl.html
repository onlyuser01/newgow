<p>Several years ago, Australia implemented tough rules against illegal offshore gambling websites. Since then, the country’s regulatory body responsible for the regulation of telecommunications, broadcasting and radiocommunications, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), has been constantly monitoring the online gambling sector and enforcing bans against operators that were found to offer their services illegally.</p>
<p>On Wednesday this week, the Authority urged internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to more illegal offshore gambling websites. This time, ACMA asked ISPs to block access to websites that included Play AUD and Crown Pokies.</p>
<p>Prior to calling for the ban, ACMA conducted investigations into the operation of the aforementioned websites. Consequently, the regulatory agency explained that the two websites offered their services in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and urged access to their websites to be restricted.</p>
<p>“Australian internet service providers (ISPs) have been requested to block access to more illegal offshore gambling websites including Crown Pokies and Play AUD. These services have been found to be in breach of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 following investigations by the ACMA,“ reads a statement released by the Australian Communications and Media Authority</p>
<p>The Authority reminded customers that using illegal gambling websites poses a risk to their personal data and funds. This is because users of offshore or illegal operators are not protected by Australian laws.</p>
<p>Additionally, ACMA warned that illegal providers may withhold winnings. The regulatory watchdog explained that a full list of the licensed online gambling providers can be found on its website. It also encouraged users to report illegal gambling providers.</p>
<p>The Authority Continues to Monitor the iGaming Market</p>
<p>Since 2017 when ACMA started enforcing the new rules against illegal offshore gambling operators, more than 210 such companies voluntarily withdrew their services from the market.</p>
<p>Still, the Authority continues to monitor the iGaming sector and only recently, requested ISPs to block four illegal gambling websites. Earlier this summer, in June, ACMA urged internet service providers to ban access to 12 illegal offshore websites. The proactive measures taken by the Authority are effective and since it started monitoring the online gambling sector, to date, it has banned more than 820 illegal gambling affiliates and online gambling websites.</p>
