    <h1>Wild Casino Online Gta Casino Borgata Casino Nj Fortune Casino Lacey Santa Fe Hotel And Casino Flush</h1>

<p>The player mounirabizeid initially contacted support to complain about RTP and then began to berate staff including inappropriate swearing and accusations of rigging.</p>
<p>As abuse is obviously not tolerated, they were informed their account was banned via email. The account had approximately $0.62 balance remaining, which Flush reserves the right to withhold in such circumstances.</p>
<p>However, had they been patient, they would have received a follow up email advising the $0.62 would have been returned to them, despite their abusive behaviour.</p>
<p>Instead, after the user was notified of the account banning they chose to then deposit another $105.78 onto the site, something we cannot prevent since crypto is a push payment system.</p>
<p>They used this forced payment to attempt to step up and formalise their complaint with a very AI written email, sent shortly after closure, claiming they had no idea why their account could have possibly been closed, and proceeded to incorrectly claim that we withheld their funds.</p>
<p>This is simply not true of course. The handling of abusive customers needs to be escalated to management and resolving queries from non-abusive customers takes priority.</p>
<p>We therefore responded confirming that their account was closed for abusive behaviour and requested KYC documentation in order to return funds.</p>
<p>We received the required documentation and returned the funds shortly after.</p>
