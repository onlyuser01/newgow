<p>Created in collaboration with Daren “End Boss” Elias, the End Boss Poker Series will take place on the partypoker US Network in three states: Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The culmination of the 6-day, 7-event series comes with The End Boss Main Event.</p>
<p>The Main Event will be an 8-max No Limit Hold’em game that will feature six-figure guarantees for each state. BetMGM explained that in each state, the winner of the Main Event will be crowned the “End Boss” of their state.</p>
<p>Besides a piece of the guaranteed prize pool, the winner will also enter a special New Year Knockout PKO tournament. The poker pro Elias will join the players in New Jersey. Any player that eliminates him from the Main Event will receive a three-day, two-night stay at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa.</p>

<p>The new poker series starts on November 23 with the 8-Max No Limit Hold’em event featuring a $535 buy-in. On November 24, a Pot-Limit Omaha 8-Max event launches. Participants that want to join will have to pay a $215 buy-in.</p>
