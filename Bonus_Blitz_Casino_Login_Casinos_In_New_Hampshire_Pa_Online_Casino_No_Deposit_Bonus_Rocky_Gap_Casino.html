    <h1>Bonus Blitz Casino Login Casinos In New Hampshire Pa Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Rocky Gap Casino</h1>

<p>Macau has put a lot of pressure on its casinos and gaming industry of late with the special administrative region or SAR choosing to clamp down on junket operators, redraft the licensing rules, and generally introduce a new and stricter governing framework that dictates the day-to-day operations of gaming establishments in the jurisdiction. This is why some have been tempted to stay ahead of the doings of law enforcement even at the cost of committing a crime.</p>
<p>VIP Gaming Rooms Try to Make Friends in High Places</p>
<p>One victim of this practice is a deputy sergeant in the Traffic Department of Macau’s Public Security Police who is suspected of having fed information to a VIP gaming room regarding police operations in exchange for kickbacks.</p>
<p>The sergeant was named in a briefing by the Commission Against Corruption (CCAC) which detailed the case on Monday. According to the CCAC, the sergeant received money and luxury hotel accommodation in exchange for inside information on the current moves of police authorities, allowing the gaming room to operate in peace.</p>
<p>An anonymous tip, though, was placed with the CCAC which stated that the sergeant was “very close” with people from the VIP gaming rooms circles and that he may have violated the law by volunteering information in exchange for gifts and other assets. The tip detailed that the sergeant had received money and other goods.</p>
<p>According to CCAC, the matter involves “large quantities of cash.” The anti-corruption body also found communication devices allegedly used by the sergeant and the VIP gaming room to exchange information. The authorities similarly targeted the VIP gaming room and managed to seize computers, phones, and documents in establishing the events.</p>
<p>Macau’s Coming Down Heavy on Gambling Industry</p>
<p>The case will now be investigated by the Public Prosecutions Office. Macau has been undergoing busy times insofar as its gambling industry is concerned. As lawmakers try to adjust the minutiae of what the new gambling framework would look like, the SAR has agreed to extend current licenses by six months to reflect the additional time needed to complete the gambling reforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SAR is not just relying on casinos and gaming to resuscitate its economy, as interest in hotel accommodation is expected to increase. Current events have also forced many companies to rethink their strategies in Macau. Las Vegas Sands has become the latest company to forego its involvement with junket operators, as the sector has come under scrutiny following the arrests of some of the most prominent representatives of the industry, including Alvin Chau and Chan Weng Lin.</p>
