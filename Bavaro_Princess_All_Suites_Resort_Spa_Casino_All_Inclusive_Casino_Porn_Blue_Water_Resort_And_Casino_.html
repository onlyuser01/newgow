    <h1>Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Spa Casino All Inclusive Casino Porn Blue Water Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>I have created an account, the account was validate and I was allowed to deposit and play on the platform, the problems started when I requested to withdrawal winnings, the casino closed my account and kept all the money.</p>
<p>They say that is because of my registration on GAMSTOP, that was made years ago by a partner and that I now have to endure until its end as they do not want to remove it even that I have proven that it wasn't a voluntary registration and it causes more harm having that registration as it gives room for the casinos to abuse it and only find problems if I try to withdrawal amounts. The good and trusty platforms process the withdrawals and then close the account, but the bad ones like in this case, use it as an excuse to keep the money.</p>
<p>I would like to have my withdrawal processed and the balance I had at the moment that they closed my account that was of around 650GBP.</p>
<p>I would like to give as reference the case that I have won when revised by IBAS where Gala Spins had to pay my winnings.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear on the GAMSTOP terms that the balance until the self-exclusion is applied has to be paid:</p>
<p>"If you have any withdrawable funds remaining in any online gambling accounts once your self-exclusion has been activated, the gambling operators of those accounts are required to return these funds to you."</p>
<p>I will provide a screenshot of my withdrawals requests, and I have requested the casino to provide me with a history of my play to check what was my balance that was around 650GBPP at the moment that the self-exclusion was activated</p>
<p>I am also including a copy of the resolution provided by IBAS when I went trough the same problem with Gala Spins.</p>
