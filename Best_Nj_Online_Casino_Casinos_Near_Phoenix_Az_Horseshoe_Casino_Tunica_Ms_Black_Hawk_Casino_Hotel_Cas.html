    <h1>Best Nj Online Casino Casinos Near Phoenix Az Horseshoe Casino Tunica Ms Black Hawk Casino Hotel Cas</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with withdrawing my money. I requested €700 first - it was cancelled due to technical issue. I received below message</p>
<p>Your withdrawal was not successful. Due to technical issue, the withdrawal to the card was not processed.</p>
<p>We recommend that you use an alternative method:</p>
<p>-Inpay;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Skrill;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neteller;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eZeeWallet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payop;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Crypto.</p>
<p>I got myself the Skrill card- uploaded it.</p>
<p>But looking at it this card - is not on the list. i technically need to deposit funds again from this card -so it will be available.</p>
<p>so i was told to try visa again. Now i done 2 transfer €1000 and €300.€1000 one was just again cancelled- and i was told again to use different method. i asked to put this on my visa - as they are able to get deposits from it - this is what i recieved back</p>
<p>I have received a message from our finance team, that bank transfers aren't available temporarily.</p>
<p>i am afraid that they have no intention to give me my money back. and they are luring me to deposit again and again from different types of cards . this is alarming for me,. Now they are telling me to upload bank statement . after they are saying bank transfers are not available. I AM NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NOW</p>
