<p>Alea Play, a company that specializes in the development of a robust aggregation platform and which has been distinguished for its product quality, has added a new prominent supplier in the face of Thunderkick.</p>
<p>Thunderkick is an independent studio and casino game developer which has been steadily gaining ground among online casino brands and players with many of its most noteworthy titles, including Bones &amp; Bounty and Hot Potato.</p>
<p>Thunderkick has achieved renown in multiple markets across the world, breaking ground in Africa, Europe and Latin America, a reach that will now be further enhanced by Alea’s own network and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alea has been operating its business for more than 10 years now, with the company originally launching in 2012 and featuring more than 10,000 hand-picked and select titles, many of which come from boutique and upstart studios such as Thunderkick, allowing Alea to offer a powerful differentiation of its own product in the long term.</p>
<p>Alea Partnership Manager Edu Verdaguer was happy with the opportunity to see Thunderkick’s titles added to the aggregation’s library. "Our API provides a one-stop modern solution for casinos in several key markets, and we’re excited to contribute to Thunderkick’s story and provide them with a whole host of new players across the globe," Verdaguer added.</p>
<p>Thunderkick Head of Sales Fredrik Ekholm was similarly pleased to see his company’s products added to Alea’s ever-growing and expanding portfolio and library that features dozens of well-established names in terms of suppliers. The representative added:</p>
<p>"Our games this year have been embraced and enjoyed by more players than ever before, and we can’t wait to keep that progress going with Alea in 2024 and beyond. It’s been a swift, smooth process thus far, and we’re looking forward to what the future holds."</p>
<p>Thunderkick has also been steadily developing its own proposition, bringing exciting new opportunities and partnerships to bear through individual and direct content injections. Some of the supplier’s notable successes this year include RushBet in Mexico and Fastbet and Bethard in Sweden.</p>
<p>The company also expanded its reach through another aggregation tie-up with REEVO earlier this year as well. All in all, the company has been well-represented across the world, making it easy for players to explore and enjoy innovative gameplay brought by Thunderkick.</p>
