    <h1>Seneca Resort Casino Grand Sweeps Casino Island View Casino Gulfport Mississippi Venetian Palazzo Re</h1>

<p>Hello Peter and Shawnarv37,</p>
<p>We are responding to the concerns raised by Ðœr.Shawnarv37 regarding a specific transaction involving the address 3D5ctV3cnxLfNczoJBcDv14wj9ywfFW42K. It is important to note that in our system this wallet indeed belongs to the player and was actively used for making deposits. In order to make our investigation as complete, as it is possible, we have searched the transactions using the ""BlockCypher"" explorer, as the moderator recommended.</p>
<p>We did research using the TxIDs provided by the Shawnarv37 that are stated in our system. It came to our attention that the transactions are indeed marked as "Double Spend". You may check the proof by following this link: https://prnt.sc/4fybc0g_wAAS What is more, after clicking on initial hash ID we can clearly see, that there was no deposit with such TxID in the system whatsoever. Once again, you are more than welcome to check it for yourself be following this link: https://prnt.sc/-ekeOKuIHlh8</p>
<p>To our deepest regret, the financial supplier confirmed that these transactions were marked as "Double Spend" in their system and were not received by our platform. As a proof, they have provided us with the following links, which state that these deposits cannot even be found:</p>
<p>https://btc.bitaps.com/2bd4b51fe97b2feb949a6a69c2869e97a43c03a54f0993e76675dc4096005cf2</p>

<p>To address this situation and demonstrate our commitment to resolving issues, we offer the following compensation. We are prepared to provide you with the transaction amounts 0.00331471 BTC and</p>
<p>0.00331327 BTC in the form of a bonus balance with a x1 wagering requirement. These amounts will be made available for you to use in our casino, and you can withdraw them once you fulfill the x1 wager. This offer is intended to showcase our willingness to resolve this situation in favor of the player.</p>
<p>Our Team extends our gratitude to the Casino Guru moderation team and to Shawnarv37 for their cooperation and understanding.</p>
