    <h1>Taos Mountain Casino Movies Cannery Casino Casinos In Council Bluffs Ovation Hall At Ocean Casino Re</h1>

<p>Dear Phillis79,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and for forwarding your cashier history. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.betterdicecasino.com/termsandconditions:</p>
<p>"The User guarantees at all times not to be a resident or citizen of countries including, but not limited to the United States and its dependencies and territories including North Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Curacao, Dutch West Antilles, France, French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern Territories, Futuna Islands, Gibraltar, Iran, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, North Macedonia, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Slovakia, UK. Players from the following countries are not eligible to use the Website and play its games. BetterDice Casino will make all reasonable efforts to prevent players from these countries to reach the games."</p>
<p>Since there is a possibility to register an account from a restricted country (see the screenshot below) and deposit funds, I would like you to confirm that you’ve submitted correct data when opening the account.</p>
<p>However, when I’ve changed my VPN to the UK, the website got blocked and I received the following massage:</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location when opening the account? Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules.</p>
<p>If there’s any relevant communication please forward it along with a screenshot of your casino profile details to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
