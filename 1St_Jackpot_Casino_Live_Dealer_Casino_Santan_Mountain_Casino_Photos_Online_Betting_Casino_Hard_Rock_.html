<p>Bragg Gaming Group, an international business-to-business supplier of gaming technology and content, has reported its quarterly results for the third quarter of 2022. The three months ended September 30 were a great time for the company, attributing to record quarterly revenue.</p>
<p>Bragg Saw Revenues Skyrocket</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming reported revenue of $20.9 million, a 62.3% increase from last year’s $12.8 million. Betting revenue from customers sat at $4.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion in Q3 2022. The company noted that its change in product mix towards turn-key customers improved its gross profit and AEBITDA.</p>
<p>Speaking of gross profit, the metric increased by 58% to $10.4 million. The company also posted an adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million, which represents a great 51.6% increase from last year’s $1.6 million. This represents an AEBITDA margin of 10.7%.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming posted a net loss of $2 million. While the company failed to record net profits, this result is still a noticeable improvement from last year’s net loss of $2.5 million. The company added that it could have performed better in this aspect, had it not been for the increased costs, expenses and higher depreciation and amortization.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $17.2 million. Thanks to the generally favorable results, the company improved its FY guidance to $76-80 million and its EBITDA guidance to $10-11 million.</p>
<p>The Company Grew Its Business</p>
<p>Bragg also highlighted some of its major achievements during the quarter. In the summer of 2022, for example, the supplier launched its Oryx-powered remote game server in Connecticut, Ontario and Michigan. At the end of September, it also finalized the integration of Wild, Oryx and Spin games.</p>
<p>In September, the company received $8.4 million in funding from Lind Global Fund. That same month, Bragg inked and a content agreement with Bally’s Interactive/Gamesys, which saw the supplier power the operator’s iGaming brands with content.</p>
<p>In the next month, Bragg teamed up with Sega Sammy Creation, receiving the exclusive rights to distribute some of the studio’s iGaming titles to operators in select regulated global markets.</p>
<p>CEO Sherman Praised the Results</p>
<p>Yaniv Sherman, Braag’s chief executive officer, commented on the results. He noted that the current results demonstrate a significant YOY revenue, gross profit and AEBITDA growth. This, Sherman said, demonstrates the company’s progress in providing content and services of quality to its quickly-growing customer network.</p>
<p>Sherman said that the company is currently looking to speed up the speed at which it develops new games and to onboard more third-party content to its platform. He is happy that the company’s library has grown and is looking to further strengthen the company’s position as a leading supplier.</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that he is proud of the company’s adjusted EBITDA performance and expects further growth in 2023, as well as increased shareholder value.</p>
