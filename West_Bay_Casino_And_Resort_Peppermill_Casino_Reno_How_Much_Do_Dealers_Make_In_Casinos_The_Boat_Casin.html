    <h1>West Bay Casino And Resort Peppermill Casino Reno How Much Do Dealers Make In Casinos The Boat Casin</h1>

<p>My account has been disabled for 10+ days and I have been more than patient, here is my timeline below of a never ending loop of waiting… If you can please assist on re-enabling my account in-order to request a withdrawal, I’d be greatly appreciative.</p>
<p>Date:</p>
<p>8/27 - I requested a withdrawal of $2500</p>
<p>8/28 - ID VERIFICATION successfully verified</p>
<p>8/28 - my Account was temporarily disabled</p>
<p>8/29- via live chat -&gt;advised my pending withdrawals will most certainly get processed with my account disabled. Advised to wait 24-48 hrs.</p>
<p>8/31- via live chat -&gt;advised me to wait another 24-48 hours for an answer.</p>
<p>9/2- via live chat-&gt; adviseme to wait for a phone call from bovada to inform me on what the issue is.</p>
<p>9/3-missed the phone call , so live chat requested another one and to wait 24-48 hrs</p>
<p>9/5-received notification that my withdrawal requested on 8/27 was declined.</p>
<p>9/6 sent email request on any updates</p>
<p>9/7 10:30 am I was contacted by phone from Bovada and verified my Information, the agent wanted to ensure me that my funds were safe and that I should have access to my account very soon and to keep checking for an email after the phone call.(which I’ve waited all day and I still haven’t received an email.</p>
<p>9/7 4:30pm spoke with live chat and they escalated to have my accounts re-enabled and i should receive an email very shortly.</p>
<p>9/7 8:00pm IF YOU COULD please help re-enabling my account now I’d be very grateful. Thank you, Craig</p>
