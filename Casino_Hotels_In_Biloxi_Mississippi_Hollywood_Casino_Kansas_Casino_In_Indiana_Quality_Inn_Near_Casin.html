    <h1>Casino Hotels In Biloxi Mississippi Hollywood Casino Kansas Casino In Indiana Quality Inn Near Casin</h1>

<p>Hello. First, I asked them for my account details and all deposit and withdrawal transaction history (GDPR). You have 30 days to provide me with this information. They didn't respond, so I filed a complaint with the commission that issued them the license. In the meantime I made them an offer of 15,000 EUR. .There was no answer. I wrote to them and said that I had filed a complaint against them with the Kanwahage Gaming Commission. Only then did they write. I was told that they would only talk to the commission. The situation forced me to do this and I offered them a refund of PLN 10,000 for the losses incurred. They had to think about it and after a month they prepared documents for signing. I sent the signed documents and an hour later I had the money in my account. I have been addicted to gambling for 25 years. I am currently preparing for 3 months of inpatient therapy. Therefore, all online casinos operating in Germany should have a German license. Grail I would do the same but I would lose 1000 times less. German legal casinos have a maximum bet of 1 euro and I believe you can only deposit 1000 euros a month, I'm not sure. At Moicasino I lost 10,000 euros in one day. Greetings</p>
