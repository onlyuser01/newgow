    <h1>Shoshone Rose Casino Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino Casino In San Jose Ca Casino In Ocean City M</h1>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Starting by parts to be clear from your answer:</p>
<p>"On 2023-06-29, additional verification was initiated on player account PLAYER966037 based on suspicious activity on player account"</p>
<p>The casino notified after analyzing that the withdrawal had been transferred. It is worth mentioning that "suspicious activity" was labeled for having won and only after a minimum of ten previous deposits.</p>
<p>"Player PLAYER966037's deposit was wagered on the Crazy Coin Flip/Crazy Time game with a maximum refund of 10-15% of the client's balance"</p>
<p>Among other things. The deposit was wagered on various slots (if I could access my account cite by history), roulette, sic bo dice, poker etc. Responding to 10%-15% games have a minimum bet. The percentage with the minimum deposit in relation is lower, so playing is allowed by the same casino. Otherwise, the obligation to be more and not correct the parameters is to fall into a trap and be accused as now that they use it to keep my money.</p>
<p>"player PLAYER966037 made a deposit with a prepaid card and requested a withdrawal to USDT wallet."</p>
<p>Clearly as I mentioned it has very easy ways to deposit like astropay. When withdrawing, it offers other options that would not be the most comfortable.</p>
<p>For example, if you know of wallets to buy cryptocurrencies, the step is cumbersome: buy the currency with money in a bank account, wait for it to be released and/or credited by the broker, and then make the deposit in the casino and wait for it to be enabled. It is a much more tedious process than if I can transfer it directly with ARS, as is the case with astropay (a method that they provide to be able to deposit and not to withdraw). It should be noted that the astropay account is duly opened in my name, so there is a record of all deposits made.</p>
<p>Based on these data, as you saw, SMOKACE says words at convenience and not the whole picture.</p>
<p>"The Casino reserves the right to monitor all transactions."." that are publicly available and are not hidden from anyone." I did not see any, they did not send.</p>
<p>The email I received, AFTER my claim regarding the delay in accreditation of the withdrawal, was to tell me that they had the right to close the account for doing something that I did not do. After that the discussion was over.</p>
<p>I have attached some of the occasions that I was able to enjoy a victory and I have shared the joy with my partner.</p>
<p>Oh, and I correct the amount claimed, which was 94,000.00 ARS. Thanks SMOKACE for reminding me</p>
<p>I remain available.</p>
