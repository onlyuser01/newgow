    <h1>Best Online Casino Bonus Fire Kirin Casino Login Krypto Loco Casino Bluewater Resort Casino Parker D</h1>

<p>I absolutely love, and with the same measure of passion, time abhor this game!</p>
<p>These Ladies have become my nemesis. I originally started with a modest buy-in of $100.00</p>
<p>The thrill ride I went on was spectacular, with one tricky little drawback... I had claimed a 200% matching bonus</p>
<p>with a 40X rollover requirement.</p>
<p>I was betting a small amount of only $2.00 per spin. Right away I hit the FREE SPINS bonus, giving me 10 free</p>
<p>spins at $2.00 a pop. During my bonus spins the FREE SPINS appeared twice more, giving me 30 spins total.</p>
<p>At the end of that initial play, I was up to somewhere around $500.00</p>
<p>So now I'm playing with the casino's money. I jack the wager up to $10.00 per spin, and after a few spins the</p>
<p>FREE SPINS bonus pops up again. To my amazement and delight, the same scenario happens again... Only this</p>
<p>time I've got 30 spins at $10.00 a spin.</p>
<p>The payout was unbelievable! At the end of that round, I'm looking at the counter go up into the THOUSANDS!</p>
<p>Right around $8,000.00</p>
<p>Then it hits me... To cash out that $200.00 bonus that I signed up for..... yup 8 grand! I had to wager that whole</p>
<p>bundle just to collect a lousy $200.00</p>
<p>the Lawless Ladies had the last laugh. As I continued to play.... I hit NOTHING! A buck or two here and there,</p>
<p>but with every spin I was losing ground. They got it all back including the "FREE" $200.00</p>
<p>This is why I won't claim extra bonuses ever again. I just play for CASH. win , lose , or draw.... I keep what I win.</p>
<p>NOW... I visit the ladies here at CASINO GURU where I can play in DEMO MODE. I Love This Game...GRRR!</p>
