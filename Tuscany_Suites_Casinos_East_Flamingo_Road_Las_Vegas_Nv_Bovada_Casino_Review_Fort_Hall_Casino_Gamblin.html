    <h1>Tuscany Suites Casinos East Flamingo Road Las Vegas Nv Bovada Casino Review Fort Hall Casino Gamblin</h1>

<p>In June I deposited $200 and I won $1800. I did then put a request to withdraw on June 26th. A day or two later they asked for documents to verify my identity. I did so. A couple days later they sent another request to verify my identity as my documents were not OK. So I did that then a couple of days later they requested I upload bank statements and bill payments etc. it’s extra it took me over three weeks to verify my account and every time they requested verification I complied. and then I got the OK that I was verified so I tried to do the withdrawal it said that my bank refused the deposit which is BS because i went to my bank and they said there is no record of a deposit trying to be made to my account. I then opened an online wallet account with Payz (one of their suggested wallets) Got all verified (Within a half hour) and tried to do a withdrawal again. All of a sudden my account is back to being unverified again and now I have to go through the whole hoopla of verify my account again which I sent the document previously verified on and this morning. I woke up to an email saying that my account can’t be verified again. I really feel this is unfair as I won this money fair and square. I have kept every conversation and have screenshots of all of my account in spin city. I don’t know how or when I’m gonna get my money but I feel like this is a scammer site and now they have all my personal information.</p>
<p>I should’ve read the reviews before I even went on this site I probably wouldn’t have touched it with a 10 foot pole. They need to be shut down they’re very unprofessional and they shouldn’t be promoted in Canada whatsoever.</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>
