<p>The Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers (AGEM) has elected Daron Dorsey as its new executive director. Dorsey will be stepping into office starting March 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Dorsey Becomes AGEM’s Executive President</p>
<p>Dorsey is a gambling industry veteran who has previously worked for the leading manufacturer and supplier of gaming machines, software, and related equipment, Ainsworth Game Technology, as its senior vice president, general counsel, and group compliance officer. Before that Dorsey served as the executive director of the gambling company William Hill US.</p>
<p>Dorsey is also a familiar face to AGEM as he has worked as its officer and general counsel for about four years. With his experience in the industry and familiarity with the AGEM, he makes for a perfect candidate, the organization argues.</p>
<p>In his new position as executive director, Dorsey will be replacing AGEM’s previous executive director, Marcus Prater. Prater has been the association’s executive director since 2008 and has over 12 years of history with it.</p>
<p>Dorsey acknowledges the great contributions of Prater to the association. The newly-appointed executive director pointed out that his predecessor has had the responsible task of guiding the AGEM through a period of exponential growth in membership. Dorsey concluded that the whole AGEM appreciates Prater’s tremendous contribution.</p>
<p>“My hope is AGEM can further build on what it has already accomplished and continue to foster a business environment where its members prosper,” Dorsey added.</p>
<p>Lucchese Welcomes Dorsey</p>
<p>Prater’s experience will be missed. AGEM’s recently appointed president, David Lucchese, lamented seeing him step away. Despite that, Lucchese believes that Dorsey will be a perfect replacement, thanks to his manufacturer background and familiarity with AGEM.</p>
<p>“Daron’s broad knowledge base, diverse skill set, and experience will be tremendous assets as he assumes this new role,” Lucchese said.</p>
<p>Lucchese became AGEM’s president at the beginning of the year. He had the responsible task of helping the association get through the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak.</p>
<p>Just like Dorsey, Lucchese is an industry professional with a strong CV before stepping into a position in the AGEM. He was formerly a member of the slot machine and gaming equipment manufacturers Everi and Bally Technologies.</p>
<p>The AGEM itself is an international non-profit trade group, representing the interest of all the manufacturers of gambling devices, slot machines, tables, and various components. It seeks to improve the manufacturing aspect of gambling and improve the conditions for those who are part of it. The AGEM is based on political and regulatory influence and the sharing of information.</p>
