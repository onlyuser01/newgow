<p>Retro Tapes review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Retro Tapes has a vintage music theme.</p>
<p>Floating back in time to the 80s and 90s, players will discover a world where old-fashioned cassette tapes rule. A nostalgic dance party will be inevitable as players get into the groove.</p>
<p>This slot is well-suited to those who are curious about music history or hoping for a walk down memory lane.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The upbeat soundtrack has a classic rock feel that brings to mind an 80s film soundtrack. It would have been interesting if other musical retro styles were explored as well. Some players may become too familiar with the soundtrack loop, but the mute button is at hand if needed.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with brightly-hued cassette tapes illustrated in a cartoon style. As the tapes bounce on the reels, they seem like little characters awaiting the next spin.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is a deep blue background accented with shimmering dots. This brings to mind a spacescape and gives Retro Tapes a touch of sci-fi atmosphere.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music combine to create a vintage music fantasy world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Retro Tapes is a six-reel, nine-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing clusters of matching symbols connected horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols will vanish from the reels, allowing new symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>The reels spin at a relatively slower speed than some slots, which gives Retro Tapes a somewhat more measured pace.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Magnet symbol and the Wild Multiplier symbol. Wild symbols start out with an associated multiplier of 1x, but whenever the Wild is part of a winning cluster, this multiplier increases by 1.</p>
<p>The Wild Multiplier symbol has a multiplier of 1x, 2x, 3x, or 5x associated with it and distributes this value to all Wild symbols in view. It then transforms into an Instant Prize symbol with a randomly selected value.</p>
<p>Instant Prize symbols function as bet multipliers and may have a value between 1x and 1000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>The Magnet symbol selects a paying symbol at random, which it attracts to its place on the reels. Once it has created a winning cluster, the Magnet symbol will change into an Instant Prize symbol.</p>
<p>Special Cluster Links have the ability to trigger instant wins and Chain clusters, which have enhanced win potential.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Wild Tape symbols, the Top the Charts feature begins. During this feature, Wild Tape symbols and Instant Prize symbols will become sticky and remain on the reels for the duration of the feature.</p>
<p>During the Top the Charts feature, the remaining empty positions will spin and land either Wild Tape, Wild Multiplier, Instant Prize, Extra Spin, or Blank Tape symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.47%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Retro Tapes is high, making it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest aiming to choose slots with the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility music-themed slot.</p>
<p>The vivid aesthetic and bonus features make Retro Tapes immediately entertaining. Meanwhile, the appealing RTP and robust high volatility make it a solid choice for mathematically-inclined players.</p>
