    <h1>Bicycle Hotel And Casino Oregon Casinos Mgm Casino Hotel Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Sacramento Hotel</h1>

<p>The Water Club will be entirely redesigned and will be renamed to MGM Tower for the resort’s 20th anniversary</p>
<p>The remodel will be all-encompassing for the guest experience, bringing new nautical design elements and celebrating the beauty of Atlantic City’s Marina District. Guests will be able to enjoy the new experience right from the start with their arrival through settling into their accommodations.</p>
<p>New Design to Invoke Coastal Feelings</p>
<p>The design and craftsmanship of Borgata’s reimagined hotel will be the fruit of a collaboration between the MGM Resorts International Design Group and RVD Associates. The latter is an award-winning interior design firm, with a name that carries weight internationally. The project’s estimation is $55 million and is scheduled for completion by Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>All 700+ guestrooms will feature warm and bright décor, with deep wood finishes and a coastal feel. A collection of the luxurious Vista Suites, located at the tower’s corners, will offer wraparound views of Atlantic City’s beauty. Additionally, a 9,000-foot versatile event space will replace the former Immersion Spa on the 32nd floor, offering breathtaking views and event-tailored capabilities.</p>
<p>“Introducing the MGM Tower connects Borgata with the unparalleled entertainment and resort experiences MGM Resorts is recognized for worldwide,” said the chief operating officer of MGM Resorts International Corey Sanders.</p>
<p>The resort’s president and chief operation officer Travis Lunn echoed the same sentiment as Sanders.</p>
<p>As we approach the resort’s 20th anniversary, we are more committed than ever to remaining a leader in hospitality and entertainment by continuing to evolve the Borgata experience. Travis Lunn, COO, Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa</p>
<p>Hence, the redesign and renaming of The Water Club are not only aimed at providing a fresher and more contemporary feel but to drive visitation rates well into the future as well.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ Global Activity Increasing</p>
<p>Another recently redesigned MGM Resorts International operation was Borgata Casino’s high-limit slots Miralto lounge. Miralto reopened in December 2022, after its multi-million redesign, offering a luxurious and exquisite experience. Plans for further renovation were shared back then, signaling that more changes were slated for the future.</p>
<p>Outside of Vegas and Nevada as a whole, MGM’s properties are still keeping the media busy with positive coverage. The MGM National Harbor is in Oxon Hill, Maryland, and its 2022 gross gaming revenue (GGR) won it the accolade of most profitable casino outside of Nevada, according to information by the American Gaming Association.</p>
<p>MGM has also been keeping busy outside the US overall, with its Macau establishment winning a new gaming concession last year. The company announced it will be investing $2 billion in MGM China – its Chinese subsidiary. The investment will be spread over the next decade, and tourism and non-gaming facilities will be a heavy focus.</p>
<p>The latter is driven by Macau’s new requirements for concessionaires, as increasing non-gaming activities was a vital part of the requirements updates. The special administrative region (SAR) recently lifted its mask mandates, exiting the COVID-19 pandemic. This, along with other factors, brought about optimism that the SAR can reach its $16 billion GGR target.</p>
