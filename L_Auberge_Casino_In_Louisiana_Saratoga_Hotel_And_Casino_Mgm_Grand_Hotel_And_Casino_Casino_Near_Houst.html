    <h1>L Auberge Casino In Louisiana Saratoga Hotel And Casino Mgm Grand Hotel And Casino Casino Near Houst</h1>

<p>According to news reports, a Michigan man was involved in an incident with his girlfriend at Saginawâ€™s Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort and is now facing a sexual assault charge. Logan Alexander Eilts, who is 20 and resides in Saginaw, assaulted the 18-year-old woman on November 10, while she was sleeping at the hotel.</p>
<p>Eilts Is Charged With One Count of Third-Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</p>
<p>As a newspaper from Michigan, The Morning Sun, reports, Eilts and his girlfriend spent the night at the hotel and, at some point, the victim woke up with Eilts on top of her. She told him to get off and eventually pushed him away.</p>
<p>However, as the Morning Sun reports, Eilts admitted having sex with her and stated that the victim was awake when they had sex. Nevertheless, he was charged with one count of third-degree criminal sexual conduct last week.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort is owned by the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, who recently partnered with Kambi Group to provide sportsbook solutions. The resort is approximately 88 miles to the northeast of Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p>In 2019, Circus Circus Hotel and Casino had a similar sexual assault case. An employee of the casino and resort at the Las Vegas Strip was accused of sexually assaulting a woman; however, he passed away while awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Arthur Joseph Martinez, the employee, who was 56 at the time, was arrested on July 26, 2019. Later on, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that he was charged with one count of sexual assault. Martinez faced life in prison if he was convicted.</p>
<p>His case was delayed due to the pandemic and, later on, dismissed in the local District Court. As the newspaper reports, the Clark County Office of the Coroner stated that Martinez committed suicide on March 26. Apart from stating that he died in his bedroom, no further information was given to the public.</p>
<p>Michigan Casinos Continue to Rebound from COVID-19</p>
<p>The commercial gaming industry in Michigan has risen pretty fast and managed to become one of the largest in the US. The three land-based casinos in Detroit netted around $110.4 million in September. Last year, AGA announced that Michigan casinos contribute $6.3 billion annually.</p>
<p>Online gaming revenue of the state in September was also pretty high as it totaled $102.4 million. That marked the all-time high monthly haul of Michigan. Just a reminder, the first legal bet in the state was placed in January.</p>
