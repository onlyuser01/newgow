<p>The current deal is the latest in a long string of recent agreements that have seen REEVO team up with many notable companies</p>
<p>A few days after signing a deal with ELA Games, REEVO, a leading B2B games provider and an aggregation platform, has unveiled another partnership agreement, this time with Red Tiger, a prominent supplier of top-tier casino games. Under the deal, the former company will integrate games from the studio into its advanced aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As agreed, Red Tiger, which is a subsidiary of Evolution Group, will supply REEVO with content, helping it bring new opportunities for both players and operators. The partnership will allow the aggregator to distribute content from the studio to its numerous operator partners.</p>
<p>As a result, Red Tiger’s engaging and captivating slots, table games and unique mechanics will reach more players, helping REEVO’s allies bolster their profitability.</p>
<p>In addition to delivering proprietary titles, REEVO’s aggregation platform includes a huge library of aggregated casino content. Through a single API integration, the B2B provider’s partners can fuel their brands with content, providing players with many games to choose from.</p>
<p>REEVO Is Rapidly Growing</p>
<p>Red Tiger and REEVO have a similar goal of “pushing the boundaries of gaming excellence.” Because of that, the current agreement was described as a “perfect fit” for both companies. Thanks to the agreement, Red Tiger will be able to expand its footprint and reach countless new players. At the same time, REEVO will get to supply its partners with more content than ever, generating extra value for its partnering operators.</p>
<p>REEVO’s head of sales, Petra Maria Poola, released a statement on the matter, saying that her team is delighted to welcome Red Tiger as a partner. She praised the developer as a company known for its exceptional games and drive for innovation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Poola noted that the deal is in line with REEVO’s commitment to delivering excellent gaming experiences to its partners.</p>
<p>By integrating Red Tiger’s impressive portfolio into our platform, we are confident that we will exceed the expectations of our operator partners and elevate their success in the dynamic iGaming industry. Petra Maria Poola, head of sales, REEVO</p>
<p>The deal with Red Tiger is the latest in a long string of aggregation agreements for REEVO. Earlier this month, the company teamed up with Spinoro for game distribution, adding more content to its platform. Prior to that, REEVO penned agreements with Evolution and Booming Games.</p>
<p>In April, the company also agreed to supply Livespins with content.</p>
