    <h1>Casino Pier Breakwater Beach Casinos In Minnesota With Hotels Dodge City Casino Best Casinos In The</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>This applies to a casino company with name on website www.gate777.com</p>
<p>I registered a couple of days ago so March 1 and I made a deposit of SEK 6000 and won SEK 4000, so I made a withdrawal of SEK 10000 and paused 24 hours for them had a function where you can cancel the withdrawal so you were afraid of losing everything . So I came back after a day and I saw that the money is still there I paused again for 24 hours. And after a couple of hours the money was in my account. You became happy of course. So I was going to do a replay, on the 3rd of March I put in 6000 SEK and won 4,000 SEK and as last time I made a withdrawal of 10000 SEK and break 24 hours. But this time did not go and log in at all even though it has passed a day. So I contacted their support via live chat and told the story then the girl said if I could wait so she could ask the right department, sure I said, so she came back and said my account is closed due to updates, and they are waiting for answers. As soon as they get the answer, send them an email to me. Then I said what to update, what is the purpose or reason for closing account just so why without even notifying. No I got no answer, the only thing she could say is that I have to wait until they mail. And how long to wait, she didn't know it either.</p>
<p>So my question to you who are knowledgeable. You can do this to your customers and be treated this way.</p>
<p>If you have closed an account then those who work there should know why and inform if there is some type of document verification or something.</p>
<p>I have been playing for so many years and have never been to anything like that.</p>
<p>Am very grateful for tips or help</p>
<p>Mvh Moses</p>
