<p>Gypsy King Favored to Win Again</p>
<p>The last time, the Bronze Bomber was a pre-fight favorite, but he ended up losing. This time, it’s Gypsy King who’s the favorite in bookmakers’ eyes.</p>
<p>The odds, however, might not be telling the truth. Sure, Fury is arguably the best pugilist of his generation, but he didn’t spend too much time preparing for this fight. At least, that’s according to his dad, John Fury.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, John Fury gave an interview, complaining about promoters failing to come to an agreement with Anthony Joshua. Apparently, the fight between two of the UK’s best fighters in history was what his son has been preparing for in 2021.</p>
<p>Fury Sr. did point out that he’s more than confident his son’s going to destroy Wilder once again.</p>
<p>Wilder to Redeem Himself?</p>
<p>Tyson Fury is the man who ruined Deontay Wilder’s flawless record of 42 wins. Ahead of their third fight, Bronze Bomber is 42-1-1, with a knockout rate of 98%.</p>
<p>According to the man himself, Wilder has been completely focused on the fight, treating it as a matter of life and death. Apart from training passionately, the American boxer has also been playing mind games on social media.</p>
<p>One of his explanations for losing the second fight was that his costume was too heavy. Bronze Bomber was rocking a 40-pound costume honoring Black History Month, which apparently made his “legs feel too heavy.”</p>
<p>He’s learned his lesson, and this time, he’s going for glory. Knocking out his nemesis would be the right way to get back on the heavyweight throne and we believe that’s exactly what he’ll do.</p>
<p>Pick: Deontay Wilder by knockout</p>
