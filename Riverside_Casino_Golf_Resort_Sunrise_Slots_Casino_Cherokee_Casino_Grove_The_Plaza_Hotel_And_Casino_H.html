<p>Sports betting and technology company DraftKings scored another sports partnership after it has been selected as a sponsor for Thursday Night Football (TNF) on Amazon’s Prime Video.</p>
<p>Engaging Content for TNF Viewers</p>
<p>The multi-year agreement between DraftKings and Amazon will see the pair deliver engaging content and unique betting offers to football fans before every Thursday game throughout the NFL season beginning this Thursday, September 15.</p>
<p>Recognizing the “tremendous opportunity” to team with “one of the world’s leading technology brands” and “offer engaging content” to TNF viewers, chief marketing officer at DraftKings Stephanie Sherman outlined the huge role the NFL season plays for the business as “the most active time of the year” for its customers.</p>
<p>Danielle Carney, head of NFL sales at Amazon Ads, was “thrilled to collaborate with DraftKings” and offer sports fans “insights and entertainment as part of the TNF viewing experience,” convinced that the addition of DraftKings will add further value to pregame discussions, fan engagement and game predictions made by the host team.</p>
<p>TNF-Themed Same-Game Parlays</p>
<p>The collaboration will feature DraftKings integrations in the form of sports betting insights and betting odds in the live pregame, while Amazon will work with DraftKings on TNF-themed offerings such as same-game parlays, which will be available to bettors via the DraftKings Sportsbook app.</p>
<p>“Prime Video is an innovator in live content and we both have a similar focus on constantly improving our customers’ experiences,” added Sherman, eager to start the collaboration and “bring millions of viewers a premium and enhanced experience” throughout the season and for many years to come.</p>
<p>Beginning this Thursday, when the Los Angeles Chargers face the Kansas City Chiefs, content from DraftKings will feature during all 15 games covered on TNF during the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>The TNF on Prime Video sponsorship is the latest sports partnership for the Boston-based sports betting and daily fantasy sports (DFS) operator that is already an official DFS and sports betting partner of the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, PGA TOUR and UFC, as well as an official DFS partner of NASCAR.</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to promoting responsible gambling and to mark the American Gaming Association (AGA)’s Responsible Gaming Education Month (RGEM) in September, DraftKings launched a new advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Featuring legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk and professional wrestler The Miz, the Practice Safe Bets advertising campaign that was announced last week seeks to engage with players in a fun and educational way and remind them to bet responsibly.</p>
