    <h1>Cannery Casino Hotel Aztec Inn Casino Casino Resorts In Arizona Casino In Nc Las Vegas Best Casino C</h1>

<p>According to their t&amp;c's, they don't accept UK players...but they do. I - because of being signed up to other RTG UK accepting casino's - signed up to this one, dumb I know as yes, I should've read the t&amp;c's instead of taking it for granted. To be fair though, the UK is listed in the drop down menu of countries to select, AND I was instantly accepted. Not only that, I received a phone call from the customer support, I asked if ok to play as by this time, I'd read the t&amp; c's &amp; it clearly stated no UK - they assured &amp; PROMISED me all was well ... I was dubious, so I didn't deposit, didn't trust them to be honest.</p>
<p>Anyway, they emailed me a free $75 chip, I won, wagered, sent all relevant verification info &amp; tried to withdraw the allowed $100...</p>
<p>Received an email today stating I'd placed bets over $5 &amp; I wasn't getting anything. So I just emailed back &amp; told them I'd no longer ever bother with them again. Thank goodness I didn't deposit!</p>
<p>Why not just be honest &amp; say that I wasn't to receive the withdrawal because I'm from the UK!??</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it's probably because they are of the mindset &amp; hopes that I do indeed deposit...well there's absolutely no chance of that - EVER.</p>
