    <h1>Hollywood Lawrenceburg Casino Casino Online Pa Casino In Niagara Falls Ny Nyc Casinos Planet Hollywo</h1>

<p>Greentube, an innovative designer of online casino content, and NOVOMATIC’s Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, has expanded its presence in Ontario, Canada through a partnership with Betway, a locally recognized and established operator. Greentube has been steadily growing its positions in the market since it obtained a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario in 2022, and it has also expanded in Manitoba, Quebec, and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Already present in the market, Greentube will further strengthen its positions by rolling out many of its leading classic and cutting-edge games with Betway, which commands one of the largest player bases in the provincial market.</p>
<p>Among the titles to be featured are options such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Sizzling Hot Deluxe, Lord of the Ocean, Apollo God of the Sun 10 Win Ways, Book of Ra Deluxe 10 Win Ways, and Egyptian Underworld, among many other.</p>
<p>All the titles provided by Greentube locally are marked by a number of innovative and market-leading mechanics. Greentube Sales &amp; Key Account Manager Jordan Wall has welcomed this opportunity and said that Greentube and Betway are known allies and partners, and that the supplier is happy to expand their relationship once again in the competitive North American market.</p>
<p>Betway Head of Marketing in Ontario Joachim Bjerg was similarly excited about this opportunity and added that the two companies' new alliance in the market was a fantastic chance for players to get access to brand new games and enjoy playing fun and innovative titles.</p>
<p>"Greentube’s will continue to help Betway thrive in the province," Bjerg concluded. All the while, Greentube has been on a tear with its market moves and expansions. The supplier has not hidden its ambitions for the market in North America, covering both the United States and Canada, including Michigan and Ontario launches with Rush Street Interactive. In Michigan, the company is also partnered up with BetMGM.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Greentube similarly obtained a license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, allowing it to roll out its products in the Keystone State, and at the beginning of 2023, the company also secured a license in Connecticut, making sure that it continues to cover all iGaming states in the highly-dynamic and fast-evolving market in the United States.</p>
