<p>Dino P.D review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Dino P.D is a dinosaur-themed slot game from the team at Push Gaming. The slot is focused on a group of dinosaurs that work as police officers and are presented in an animated style.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The Dino P.D slot has an almost cartoon-like feel. This is not the first time the developer has used dinosaurs as a theme, with the Dinopolis slot also being about a group of dinosaurs hitting a Las-Vegas style city. While the slots arenâ€™t directly related, they have a very similar style and design, which means we could see more dino-themed titles from Push Gaming in the future.</p>
<p>The game has a really fun soundtrack that sounds as though it has pulled inspiration from some 1970s and 80s cop shows.</p>

<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Dino P.D slot uses a standard 5x4 setup for the base game. This allows for 20 active paylines on every spin.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are formed by matching three or more symbols across a payline, starting on the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The game is controlled on the right-hand side of the screen, with the stack of coins icon used to change the stake, and autospin and Bonus Buy features available. Bonus Buy options may not be available in all locations.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Dino P.D game has a selection of useful bonus features. One of the first you are likely to notice is the Dino Coins. These will display x1, x2, x5, x10, x25, x50, x100, x250, x500, or x1,000. You will need to land at least five of these for them to pay out.</p>
<p>Players should look out for the Scatter symbol. These can only land on reels one and three, with the Gamble Scatter symbol only able to land on reel five. When you land two Scatters and a Gamble Scatter, the Gamble Scatter will spin and reward either the Bronze, Silver, or Gold Free Spins. With zero or one-star rewarding Bronze, two or three rewarding Silver, and four rewarding Gold.</p>
<p>In Bronze Spins, get between eight and ten spins with one Low Paying Symbol converted to a Dino Coin symbol. In Silver, you get the same number of spins with two or three Low Paying Symbols converted, and with Gold, you get the same again, with four symbols converted.</p>
<p>Player has option to gamble with the Free Spins feature</p>
<p>If you win either Bronze or Silver spins, then you are given the chance to gamble them up to Gold, though you can lose all of your spins by doing this.</p>
<p>During the spins, Coin Collector symbols are collected in a meter on the right-hand side of the grid. When you collect four Collector symbols, the next low-paying symbol on the meter will be converted into Dino Coins. Every time you move up a level on the meter, extra spins and Multipliers can be added to the grid.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Dino P.D slot has been given a medium/high volatility rating by Push Gaming. The slot has a maximum win of 10,000x your stake and has an RTP of 96.38%, though this varies depending on what bonuses are active. This puts it above average, making it an optimal game for our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>High symbols paytable for the Dino PD slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Dino P.D is a fun online slot game from Push Gaming. The bonus features complement the base game really nicely and can lead to some good gameplay sequences with some strong winning potential. The progressive-style feature in the Free Spins round creates the best winning chances in the game. Overall, this is a slot we are happy to recommend taking for a spin.</p>
