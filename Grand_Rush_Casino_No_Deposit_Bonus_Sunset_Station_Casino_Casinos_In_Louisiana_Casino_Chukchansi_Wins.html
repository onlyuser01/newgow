<p>DraftKings subsidiary VSiN is making another foray in the world of sports betting, with the company announcing a content distribution deal with Google-owned streaming giant YouTube TV. The partnership will bring VSiN’s extensive coverage of real-time sports betting news, analysis, and entertainment programming to YouTube TV’s Sports Plus add-on package available for $10.99/month.</p>
<p>More Sports Betting Coverage Coming to YouTube</p>
<p>Commenting on this tie-up, VSiN CEO Brian Musburger said that the company was excited to continue bringing its 24/7 dedicated sports coverage and now to YouTube TV subscribers as well. “As the first sports betting content provider of the streaming service, we look forward to delivering original programming from some of the biggest names in the industry to the millions of YouTube TV subscribers and the growing number of fans who wager on sports across the country,” added Musburger.</p>
<p>Each week, VSiN will provide YouTube TV Sports Plus subscribers with 100 live, linear hours of sports and entertainment programming, with a focus on betting. There will be various personalities from the sports world involved, including Gill Alexander, Michael Lombardi, and Brent Musburger. Other talents will include Mitch Moss, Pauly Howard, Shaun King and more.</p>
<p>DraftKings CMO Brian Angiolet commented on this development by explaining that VSiN is a trusted authority in anything that pertains to sports betting news, analysis and information and is part of DraftKings’ overarching media strategy.</p>
<p>VSiN Brings Unmatched Expertise and Insight on Betting</p>
<p>DraftKings has been keen on expanding its tech arm and to be seen as an “Amazon” of sports betting, and perhaps not only in that vertical. “YouTube TV will provide our millions of skin-in-the-game sports fans with a seamless and engaging content experience, and as the convergence of betting and streaming technologies continues to expand, DraftKings will remain opportunistic in exploring additional opportunities on various platforms,” Angiolet explained.</p>
<p>VSiN prides itself on bringing hard-hitting sports betting coverage with deep dives into potential game outcomes and why athletes and teams perform the way they do from one season to the next.</p>
<p>VSiN turns to many people directly involved with the sports betting industry, including experienced bettors, oddsmakers and companies that provide distinct coverage. The network focuses on sharing expert tips and predictions for all major sports and beyond, including professional and college football and basketball, baseball, golf, hockey and more.</p>
