<p>Two NFC West rivals – San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals – are going south of the border in Week 11. Estadio Azteca in Mexico City is the place where these two will play the Monday Night Football game.</p>
<p>Knowing that both teams are still in the competition for the divisional title, you can be sure that their MNF clash is going to be a true barnburner. That’s why we decided to preview the Niners vs Cardinals game and share our top picks with you.</p>

<p>The Niners are Dreaming Big</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers are coming off a 22-16 win over the Los Angeles Chargers last Sunday. It was their fifth win of the season, which has improved their chances of making the playoffs (81% chance). In fact, they even stand a good chance to finish top of the division (60% chance). Right now, they’re just one win behind the Seattle Seahawks who haven’t yet had their bye week.</p>
<p>Even though the Niners scored only 22 points last weekend, their offense was pretty impressive that day. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo threw 19 for 28 for 240 yards, getting to a 94.3 passer rating. None of his throws resulted in a touchdown, but he did score one rushing TD himself. The other one was the work of Christian McCaffrey.</p>
<p>Apart from doing well in the offense, the Niners have also been superb in the defense. Defensive end Nick Bosa is having the season of his life. Against the Chargers, he recorded four tackles for loss, along with three quarterback hits. As a result, he’s now ranking 1st in the conference and second in the league in sacks (9.5 sacks per game).</p>
<p>Quarterback Troubles for the Cardinals</p>
<p>The Cardinals are coming off a win over the reigning NFL champions, the Los Angeles Rams, but we doubt they’re going to be able to replicate their performance from a week ago.</p>
<p>With backup QB Colt McCoy, they were able to score 27 points from one passing touchdown (scored by A.J. Green) and two rushing TDs (both by James Conner).</p>
<p>The bad news is that McCoy is now doubtful for the MNF clash, and the same goes for the starting QB, Kyler Murray. What this means is that third-string signal-caller Trace McSorley may start in Mexico City.</p>
<p>This really is a shame, considering that Arizona’s WR duo – Marquise Brown and A.J. Green – can finally play together. Brown is coming back from an injury, while Green has only recently started playing after a lengthy suspension.</p>
<p>49ers vs Cardinals Prediction</p>
<p>The 49ers are a much better team than the Cardinals, especially with Arizona’s quarterbacks being banged-up. That said, we expect San Francisco to triumph in Mexico City, covering the spread along the way.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
