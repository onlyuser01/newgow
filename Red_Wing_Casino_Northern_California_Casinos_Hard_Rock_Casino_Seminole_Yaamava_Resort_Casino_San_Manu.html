    <h1>Red Wing Casino Northern California Casinos Hard Rock Casino Seminole Yaamava Resort Casino San Manu</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming has revealed that there has been a fourth Mega Jackpot winner since this jackpot type was introduced in June. One lucky player happily landed a win of €1,457,820 while playing Dream Drops Diamond off a €0.33 wager at Vavada Casino, the company said in a press release. The game comes with five prize levels, including Rapid, Midi, Maxi, Major and Mega Jackpot, which is the largest of the five.</p>
<p>Turning €0,33 into Seven-Figure Win</p>
<p>Out of these five categories, there have been a total of more than one million winners, including 41 Major Jackpot winners and now four Mega Jackpot Winners. The must-drop jackpot mechanic was introduced by the company back in March 2022 and implemented into a number of titles, including Temple Tumble 2, Volatile Vikings 2, TNT Tumble, Neko Night Snake Arena, Wild Chapo, and not least, Dream Drop Diamonds. The news was welcomed by Relax and Vavada Casino who were happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard said that the Dream Drop Jackpot is an incredible feature that allows an ever-increasing number of players to trigger excellent rewards and prizes. She added:</p>
<p>We hope this latest Mega win inspires keen jackpot hunters to take a chance at our revered high-frequency offering. Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Vavada Casino spokesperson Polina Diasamidze was similarly pleased that Vavada Casino was the place where the latest Dream Drop Jackpot winner played. She congratulated the winner and said:</p>
<p>Winning a huge progressive jackpot is a truly a thing of dreams, and we’re proud to be part of making someone’s dream come true. Vavada Casino spokesperson Polina Diasamidze</p>
<p>Relax Continues to Grow Its Offering</p>
<p>In the meantime, Relax Gaming has had a very busy year. The company has continued to add new studio partners to its Silver Bullet and Powered By programs. Most recently, those were Thunderkick and Jade Rabbit Studio joined the partner programs. Jackpots are huge leverage in the arsenal of casinos and suppliers, as they use them to bolster engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Must-drop jackpots are always a favorite as they are bound to drop over a specified period of time, making them ideal for marketing purposes. Relax Gaming is also seeking to expand rapidly in the North American market as the company believes that the market is poised to explode and that the demand for innovative imaging products is huge.</p>
