<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming, an online casino aiming to offer innovative and realistic iGaming experiences, has reiterated its commitment to professional sports by agreeing to extend its partnership with the Detroit City Football Club soccer team.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Expands Commitment to Detroit City FC</p>
<p>The club, also known as Le Rouge, was founded in 2012 and has quickly grown to be a respected player in the US soccer scene. The team was just accepted into the United Soccer League (USL) – a tier two American football league. Detroit City FC previously competed in the US National Independent Soccer Association (NISA). It was then that it signed its first partnership deal with Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Golden Nugget Online Gaming became Detroit City FC’s official training kit sponsor for the team’s Men’s and Women’s teams. The agreement included the two partners collaborating on several instances, including working on digital activations, VIP experiences, and exciting community initiatives. Back then, T.J. Winfrey, Golden Nugget’s chief of partnerships, emphasized that the operator is a community-oriented brand that looks forward to providing Michigan punters and sports fans with exciting experiences.</p>
<p>Since 2021, when the club first started working with the operator, the two have grown closer. Celebrating Le Rouge’s admission into the USL, the operator expanded its deal with the team. This means that fans of Detroit City FC can expect more premium community content made in collaboration with Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>Fans Can Now Bet on Le Rouge’s Matches</p>
<p>A highlight of the expanded agreement is that soccer fans can now bet on Le Rouge’s matches on GoldenNuggetCasino.com for the first time ever. Additionally, Colden Nugget Online Gaming’s sportsbook will include a new category under its “Golden Line Odds Boosts” feature, called “Le Rouge Boosts.” As the name suggests, the latter is exclusively dedicated to Detroit City FC.</p>
<p>Samir Benerjee, Golden Nugget Online Gaming’s director of marketing, commented that his company is delighted to see Le Rouge’s admitted into the USL. Benerjee said that the operator is happy with the club’s successes and is committed to supporting the team and its fans through partnership efforts. He added:</p>
<p>“This season GNOG is inviting fans to engage with the team even further. They can get the new and exclusive DCFC Le Rouge Boosts, only available on the GNOG Sportsbook.” Golden Nugget Online Gaming director of marketing Samir Benerjee</p>
<p>Fans will have an opportunity to bet on Detroit City FC very soon as the team will soon clash with Charleston Battery. The match will take place in the Keyworth Stadium in Detroit with Le Rouge as the home team. The game is scheduled for March 19 and will be an exciting opportunity for fans of Detroit City FC to wager on their favorite team.</p>
