<p>Caesars and Raynham Park plan to open one of the biggest sports betting destinations in the United States</p>
<p>Casino giant Caesars Entertainment has teamed up with Raynham Park, a simulcast racing center in Massachusetts. The two entities will unite their efforts to open a new in-person sportsbook just south of Boston.</p>
<p>These plans are still awaiting regulatory approval but if approved, would mark Caesars’ in-person entry into Massachusetts.</p>
<p>A New Sportsbook to Open South of Boston</p>
<p>If approved, the new sportsbook will be one of the largest free-standing race and sports betting facilities in the country. According to Caesars’ plans, the new location will be a giant 30,000-square-foot venue that will be able to accommodate countless sports enthusiasts. It will sport the usual luxurious atmosphere Caesars is known for.</p>
<p>As agreed, Caesars and Raynham Park will open a temporary sportsbook inside the current simulcasting facility while the official location is being constructed. The new building, Caesars believes, should be complete by mid-2023, allowing a quick transition to the new venue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caesars plans to also launch its online sportsbook in the state, allowing people to place wagers from their computers or mobile devices. Once the Bay State officially launches online sports betting, fans will be able to enjoy the operator’s exciting offerings and rich selection of betting markets. As an added bonus, Caesars and Raynham Park will allow mobile punters to use cash deposited at the new sportsbook to play online.</p>
<p>Caesars is excited by the opportunity with Raynham Park, which has been operating in the state for the last 80 years. In addition, the former company promised to continue promoting responsible gambling to customers, providing Bay State users with all the tools they need to regulate their gaming behavior.</p>
<p>The Carney Family Is Thrilled to Be Working with Caesars</p>
<p>Eric Hession, the president of Caesars Digital, noted that Raynham Part is an excellent location for a new Caesars sportsbook. He added that his team is excited to work together with the racing center and provide local bettors with great betting opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s great to partner with the Carney family, which has a long history in the community and an exciting vision for a tremendous sports entertainment and pari-mutuel simulcasting facility. Eric Hession, president, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>Chris Carney, the current owner of Raynham Park, said that he feels honored to be chosen as one of Caesars’ partners. Carney is also extremely excited about unleashing one of the biggest sports betting destinations in the United States alongside Caesars Sportsbook.</p>
<p>With Caesars’ legendary commitment to quality and integrity, Raynham Park will be a world-class venue that will set a new standard for gaming in Massachusetts. Chris Carney, owner, Raynham Park</p>
