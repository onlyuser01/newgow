<p>Bayes Esports, the leading provider of official esports live data and services, has penned a distribution agreement with SB Betting Software, a provider of a cutting-edge betting services platform. As per the deal, the former company will leverage its betting odds marketplace, BODEX, to power SB’s betting software solutions.</p>
<p>The partnership agreement will see SB Betting Software integrate the BODEX odds feed into its betting services platform, enabling current and future sportsbook clients to benefit from the full range of odds offered on BODEX. By combining its best-in-class solutions with the highest quality odds feeds in esports, SB Betting Software hopes to become one of the best betting services platforms on the market.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports’ BODEX is an unprecedented platform that integrates odds from both general and specialized traders. The odds it offers are standardized depending on their data format, market definitions and API. Thanks to this, betting operators can easily and intuitively integrate these odds into their own offerings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, operators can use BODEX’s capabilities to subscribe to very specific odds packages that differentiate between the included sports or games, organizers, tournaments, leagues and markets. Thus, BODEX can save operators a lot of money they would have otherwise paid for multiple integrations while allowing them to offer odds for a plethora of games and events.</p>
<p>SB Betting Software, on the other hand, is a one-stop shop for innovative betting software solutions, including data management, apps and user interfaces. The company has cemented itself as a reliable supplier of sports betting solutions and is working together with a number of operators in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The Integration Will Help SB Drive Innovation</p>
<p>Michal Glowacki, SB Betting Softwaere’s chief operation officer, said that his team is looking forward to working with Bayes Esports. He praised the latter company’s expertise and reputation, saying that these qualities make it a perfect partner for his company.</p>
<p>By integrating our software solutions with Bayes Esports’ odds feed, we aim to drive innovation and enhance the overall esports betting experience. Michal Glowacki, COO, SB Betting Software</p>
<p>Martin Dachselt, Bayes Esports’ chief executive officer and managing director, also commented on the matter, welcoming SB Betting Software to the Bayes family. He praised their solutions that provide gambling companies with an opportunity to “venture further into sports and esports betting.</p>
<p>With us supporting those solutions with our one-of-a-kind odds feed, we can work together to drive innovation in the esports betting industry. From software and interfaces to the highest-quality odds available on the market, the SB Software platform offers sportsbooks everything they need to level up their esports coverage. Martin Dachselt, CEO &amp; MD, Bayes Esports</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bayes Esports agreed to serve as the exclusive match data provider for many tournaments hosted by ESL FACEIT Group.</p>
