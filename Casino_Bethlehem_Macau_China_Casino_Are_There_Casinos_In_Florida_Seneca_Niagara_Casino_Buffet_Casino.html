<p>Kentucky is an interesting and admittedly busy place of late. The state just had a new piece of legislation, House Bill 106, pitched in the hopes of legalizing sports gambling, online poker, and fantasy contests.</p>
<p>Yet, the Kentucky Merchants and Amusement Coalition, a trade group is also looking to shape the gambling narrative and address one issue that it feels current legislative efforts are falling short of.</p>
<p>KY MAC insists that lawmakers should focus on eliminating illegal gambling in the Bluegrass State which, the organization, argues should target the regulation of skill games. A new awareness campaign has already been launched, with materials available through digital channels and on the radio.</p>
<p>Organization President Wes Jackson has outlined some of the problems the organizationâ€™s members saw in the current status quo. Jackson confirmed that the coalition is already communicating closely with lawmakers from the House and Senate to ensure that unregulated gaming is shut down while additional tax revenue is found for the state.</p>
<p>"As an organization, our goal is to support legitimate sources of entertainment, such as billiards and skill games, that inject money into the commonwealth," he added. The coalition is mostly represented by small business owners who feel that illegal gambling operations are hurting local economies and depriving hard-working residents of revenue or putting them out of business.</p>
<p>According to the coalition, the proliferation of unregulated skill games is forcing legitimate businesses to struggle or even jeopardize their existence in certain places. Skill games, says KY MAC, can drive revenue and success for certain small establishments, but in order for everyone to benefit, a clear-cut licensing system ought to be introduced.</p>
<p>KY MAC Secretary Tim Crisante confirmed as much. "Skill games are proven to bring in supplemental income to Kentucky small businesses throughout the state," he said. The games go well with food and beverages and help businesses get additional money from patrons.</p>
<p>To make sure that everyone has a level playfield, any further regulatory attempts should focus on cracking down on illegitimate gambling in Kentucky, Crisante concluded flatly. Kentucky is in the midst of new legislation that will attempt to see a number of gambling verticals licensed and regulated.</p>
<p>Whether the Bluegrass State succeeds is not yet certain, although voices in support of the gambling industry have become more vociferous of late. Still, Kentucky needs to clear a long road ahead of it before it can expand gambling. Skill games, though, must be one of the issues that the legislature addresses, KY MAC insists.</p>
