<p>The leading provider of exciting and innovative entertainment within the sports betting, casino and esports betting vertical that is also a part of Super Group, Betway, announced a partnership extension, reaffirming its commitment to supporting the growth of sports in Ghana. Earlier this week, the company revealed it has extended its sponsorship collaboration with Ghana Football Association (GHA) for the Ghana Women's Premier League.</p>
<p>Initially, the duo joined forces last year in February. Now, under the terms of the extended sponsorship deal, Betway will continue to be GHA's Official Development Partner for the Women's Premier League.</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, the Women's Premier League in Ghana will continue to benefit from different trainings, including leadership, operational and governance workshops organized by the famous brand. This will enable the participants to "lead themselves and their respective organizations effectively," a statement released by the GHA reveals.</p>
<p>What's more, under the sponsorship deal, the participating teams will benefit from receiving warm-up kits, as well as training equipment from Betway. On the other hand, this sponsorship deal complements the brand's efforts to help with the development of sports in the country. As noted, the deal builds upon a strong foundation dating back to last year, which means that the participating teams can now continue their training and gain new invaluable knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>GFA General Secretary Prosper Harrison Addo, commented regarding the extended sponsorship deal saying: "The Ghana Football Association is extremely happy that we have been able to renew our relationship with our cherished Official Development Partner for the Women's Premier League. "</p>
<p>He explained that the extended collaboration with Betway will help by bringing further improvements to Women's Football. At the same time, Addo said that the sponsorship will help "bridge the resources gap between men and women football." Finally, he said: "The recent improvements in women's football have started yielding great results."</p>
<p>Kwabena Oppong Nkrumah, Betway's Country Manager, added: "We are delighted to announce an extension of our sponsorship with the Ghana Football Association for the Women's Premier League."</p>
<p>He acknowledged that thanks to sponsorship deals, the brand reaffirms its commitment to boosting the development of sports in Ghana. Last but not least, Nkrumah said: "Our goal is to help grow our women's football in Ghana and develop interest in the game."</p>
<p>The extended deal in Ghana comes on the heels of another important collaboration announced by Betway recently. Back in January, the company extended its partnership with Sportradar, the leading sports technology company.</p>
