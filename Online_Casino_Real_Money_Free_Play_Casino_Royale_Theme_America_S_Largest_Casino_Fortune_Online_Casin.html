<p>Betway and BetGames, a celebrated operator of casino and sports betting products and a studio that develops unique products for the iGaming sector respectively, have teamed up to introduce a bespoke crash game to players. The game is a branded version of BetGames’ established Skyward crash title which has launched recently and is already becoming known to fans all over the world for its thrilling and captivating gameplay, and the potential to win big playing it.</p>
<p>Crash games in particular have been an outstanding genre that has brought much joy to players from all over the world. Recently, a SPRIBE’s Aviator player won more than $500,000 playing the title in Ghana.</p>
<p>Skyward is another excellent and highly-thematic game that offers low data consumption, and brilliant visuals and runs across various devices and operating systems, guaranteeing smooth play from start to finish. Players are very welcome to explore Skyward as they go along and stand a chance of multiplying their win as the plane soars through the skies and pushes the possible outcome to its limits.</p>
<p>BetGames VP Sales Africa James Everett has welcomed the opportunity to see the Skyward game customized and branded for the needs of Betway and introduce it to local audiences in regulated markets.</p>
<p>"Our continued dedication to meeting the needs of local players and understanding our markets has seen us grow our partnership with Betway and we’re proud that it continues to choose us to provide the best, tailored experiences for its players," Everett said.</p>
<p>Betway Africa Product Manager Hailee Cook was similarly pleased with the opportunity to once again work with BetGames. Cook said that a branded version of Skyward for the needs of Betway audiences is not the first time the two companies have collaborated together to deliver an exciting experience to their players.</p>
<p>"Having the latest games presented with our familiar environment and feel is important to our loyal players and Skyward hits that mark again," Cook added.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a meaningful alliance that will benefit players and bring around innovative concepts to explore. Skyward is the first crash game that the supplier has developed, released a little over a week ago, and demonstrates BetGames’ commitment to establishing innovative concepts.</p>
