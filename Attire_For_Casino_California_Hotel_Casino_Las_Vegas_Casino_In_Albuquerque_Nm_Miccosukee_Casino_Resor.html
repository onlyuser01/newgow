    <h1>Attire For Casino California Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casino In Albuquerque Nm Miccosukee Casino Resor</h1>

<p>The software provider for the growing online gambling sector, EveryMatrix, announced a senior-level appointment Tuesday. The company confirmed it hired the services of Tor Skeie as the CEO of OddsMatrix, the company’s sportsbook division. In his new role with the company, Skeie will oversee the company’s sports business and spearhead its growth.</p>
<p>Overall, he brings more than two decades of experience within the gaming and betting vertical. In particular, Skeie has experience in the development and delivery of innovative technology. Moreover, he was a part of one of the first peer-to-peer betting exchanges for the vertical dating back to 2001.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, Skeie founded the Thailand-based development company TOTOIT. The business that specialized in developing custom programming, as well as intranet/extranet designs, was then acquired in October 2020 by EveryMatrix. Since the acquisition, TOTOIT has played a major role in the development of leading front-end solutions and products at EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>The appointment doesn’t come unexpectedly, considering the exponential growth reported by OddsMatrix in 2022. In fact, last year, the company secured deals with multiple high-profile companies, such as Bet-at-home for example. Currently, OddsMatrix’s team consists of 150 traders, developers, as well as a dedicated support team.</p>
<p>Skeie to Help OddsMatrix Continue to Grow</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment Skeie said that it is exciting to join the company at such an important moment of its growth. Moreover, he confirmed that he will continue to collaborate with OddsMatrix and help it become the go-to sportsbook platform solutions provider for the industry.</p>
<p>“It’s a great thrill to lead the sports business unit and to continue to build on the brilliant work the team have done in making OddsMatrix one of the fastest growing and most reliable sportsbook platform solutions offerings in our industry.“ Tor Skeie, CEO at OddsMatrix</p>
<p>Skeie added that he will prioritize offering supreme services for existing and new clients of the company. Finally, he said that by collaborating with OddsMatrix, he will seek to improve performance and stability, which in turn is expected to help the company continue to grow.</p>
<p>“Myself and many of the leadership team have known Tor for many years and he has been an excellent addition to the business since acquiring TOTOIT.“ Ebbe Groes, CEO at EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix’s CEO, added that the company’s management-level team collaborated with Skeie since the acquisition of TOTOIT. He acknowledged that Skeie is a great addition to the OddsMatrix’s team. Finally, Groes predicted that Skeie will leverage his extensive experience to propel OddsMatrix to its next level of growth.</p>
