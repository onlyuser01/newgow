<p>The leading iGaming operator, ComeOn Group, announced it secured a new certification, recognizing its efforts in information security and data management. The company said Wednesday that it secured ISO 27001 certification for its Information Security Management System. The certification recognizes the company's efforts in terms of Security and improving User Experience.</p>
<p>The ISO 27001 certification is an international standard that focuses on management systems related to information security. It recognizes efforts related to data security and compliance with different regulations. At the same time, the certification provides guidelines for continuous compliance and maintenance of information security systems.</p>
<p>To secure an ISO 27001, organizations go through an extensive process that probes their policies, procedures and controls related to information security. The certification seeks to ensure that companies can securely transfer and safeguard data. Additionally, the ISO 27001 certification evaluates efforts to protect commercial as well as personal data.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group's Chief Information Officer, Mikael Ångman, shared his excitement about the recent certification in a statement. He said that the latest ISO 27001 certification represents a milestone moment for the company. "It goes well in line with our objectives to achieve excellence throughout our whole organization, especially when it comes to Information Security Management related to our overall security of our proprietary platform and our customers," added Ångman.</p>
<p>Finally, he pointed out: "The teamwork has been great across all departments and our highly skilled Information Security team has shown the way with great resilience leading this project from start to end."</p>
<p>The latest certification represents one of the many efforts ComeOn has demonstrated to ensure its sustainable growth. At the same time, the company seeks to ensure that its operations comply with regulations within different jurisdictions and information security is an important part of that process. Ultimately, ComeOn wants to deliver entertaining experiences for its customers that are at the same time secure.</p>
<p>Securing the certification follows an extensive review of ComeOn's security processes and controls. The probe was conducted by GLI Bulletproof, an independent certification body. The extensive audit that the company went through evaluated different information security verticals such as risk management processes, information security policies, incident management, network security and access controls, among others.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ComeOn Group strengthened its senior-level team by hiring Sherwin Jarvand. Joining the company, he was appointed to the role of Chief Data Officer. The appointment came during a busy period for ComeOn Group, which plans to expand further its global footprint and enter new markets.</p>
