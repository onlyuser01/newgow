<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Over a year ago, my account with Unibet was closed due to multiple accounts, mainly because I opened accounts while I was still a minor back in 2017 and begin 2018. When I turned 18, I created a legitimate account with my real date of birth and my real details, as I didn’t want to give them any reason to confiscate any winnings back then. Part 1 of my complaint is that I was able to play as a minor.</p>
<p>The reason my account was closed wasn’t because their security found out about it. It’s because I started chatting with them saying I don’t ever want to play with Unibet again because I can’t handle myself and am getting addicted to gambling. They then closed my "legitimate" account, and fortunately I wasn’t able to login my account again so I couldn’t play which was a good thing. I could focus on other things again.</p>
<p>A period after that, the urge to start gambling started creeping up again. I was used to playing with Unibet so I contacted a friend of mine and was able to deposit over €25K in the last year to his account, using my own banking account with my own name, which was linked to my own closed Unibet account, and I was able to withdraw the funds to his banking account, registered under his name.</p>
<p>I contacted Unibet about this issue, but every time I jump in the chat I get the same answer. They are looking into it. I will hear more when there’s more information. The information never comes. Me playing as a minor is already known by Unibet for over a year. They don’t do anything to fix it. I’m sick and tired of waiting.</p>
<p>Unibet doesn’t make sure that (self-)excluded players can’t play at Unibet again. They didn’t verify the used payment methods as they should stated by MGA, because if they did, they would find out that the funds were being deposited by an excluded player which shouldn’t be possible. This is not only bad for me as a player, but also for the sake of being unable to launder money or funding terrorism.</p>
<p>Because my personal details - including my banking account - were all known by Unibet, my conclusion is that their security needs to be stepping up in order to prevent (self-)excluded players to be able to play again with a friends account. I think it’s publicly known that addicts will find ways to play. They should verify every payment method. MGA clearly states so. This is a dangerous issue that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>I’m looking for a financial compensation for the profit they made on me as a minor and for the profit they made on me as an excluded player. I also want them to step their game up because errors like these can cause money laundering and funding terrorism which is really dangerous.</p>
<p>Casino Guru, can you help me to solve this issue for once and for all. I don’t want to step to MGA.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>KJ</p>
