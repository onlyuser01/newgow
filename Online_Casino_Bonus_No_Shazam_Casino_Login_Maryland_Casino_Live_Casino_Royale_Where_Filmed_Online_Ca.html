<p>USMNT vs. Canada is arguably the biggest soccer game in the world this weekend. This is a quarterfinal game of the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will take place at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, OH, on Sunday, July 9</p>
<p>It’s time for another USMNT vs. Canada duel. Only three weeks after the Americans beat the Canadians 2-0 to claim the CONCACAF Nations League, the two meet again. This time, it’s in the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p>
<p>It’s a different competition, and things are quite different now. The thing is that the biggest soccer stars from each country are not taking part in the 2023 Gold Cup. For instance, the USMNT is without such elite players as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, and Folarin Balogun. Meanwhile, Canada is without its biggest superstar Alphonso Davies, as well as Jonathan David, Cyle Larin, and a few others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even without their best players, these two teams have made it to the Gold Cup quarterfinal. But which of these will end the journey at this stage? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>USMNT’s Offense Has Been Killing It in Gold Cup 2023</p>
<p>After a relatively bleak performance in the opening round of the Gold Cup, in which they drew 1-1 with Jamaica, the Americans went on to blow out Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. They won each of those games 6-0.</p>
<p>FC Dallas’ striker Jesus Ferreira was the standout player in both of those, scoring a hat-trick each time. The rest of the goals scored by the USMNT at the 2023 Gold Cup were the work of Djordje Mihailovic (two goals), Brandon Vazquez (two goals), Bryan Reynolds, Gianluca Busio, and Cade Cowell.</p>
<p>The Americans have been great at the back as well. They did concede a goal against Jamaica, but other than that, their goalie Matt Turner hasn’t been much busy. That’s no surprise knowing that he’s got some amazing defenders to protect him – Matt Miazga, Aaron Long, DeAndre Yedlin, and so on.</p>
<p>Luck’s Been on Canada’s Side So Far</p>
<p>The Canadians have made it to the quarterfinal of the Gold Cup but saying that they deserved it might not be 100% true. The thing is that they got to the knockout stage with a 1-2-1 record in the group phase. That’s kind of disappointing considering that they played in a relatively easy group.</p>
<p>They were -455 favorites against Guadeloupe in the first round, but the game finished with 2-2 on the scoreboard. In round 2, their 2023 Gold Cup odds were -167 to beat Guatemala, but the game finished with no goals on either end. Finally, in the third round, they got their first win of the tournament. They beat the +3300 underdog Cuba 4-2.</p>
<p>USMNT vs. Canada Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for this game is that the United States men’s national team will steamroll Canada. The Americans have been playing much better soccer than their northern neighbors so anything but a convincing win for the 2023 Gold Cup hosts would be a surprise.</p>
<p>Pick: USMNT to win</p>
