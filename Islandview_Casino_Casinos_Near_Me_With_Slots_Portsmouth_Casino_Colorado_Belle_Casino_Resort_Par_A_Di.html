<p>One of the fastest-growing gaming companies in North America, Rush Street Gaming, has announced a new senior-level appointment. The company confirmed it hired the services of Joe Lodise, an experienced casino executive, to the role of General Manager of Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady.</p>
<p>Although Lodise's appointment was announced last week, Rush Street Gaming confirmed that he was set to start on April 24, pending approval from the gambling regulator in New York, the New York State Gaming Commission, a statement released by the company revealed.</p>
<p>In his new role, Lodise will spearhead Rivers Casino, as well as The Landing Hotel. Famous as a premium luxury and popular tourist attraction, Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady offers engaging and entertaining experiences. The casino resort which is also the home of the popular BetRivers Sportsbook, is lauded as one of New York's "Top Workplaces," according to its employees and the Albany Times Union.</p>
<p>Tim Drehkoff, Rush Street Gaming's CEO, shared his excitement about the recent appointment saying: "We're thrilled to welcome Joe to the Rush Street Gaming family and Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady."</p>
<p>Last but not least, the CEO noted: "His over 15 years of gaming and hospitality experience in highly competitive markets, along with his exceptional leadership skills, financial acumen, and support of community initiatives makes him a perfect fit for Rivers Schenectady."</p>
<p>Lodise was raised in Delaware County, Pennsylvania and graduated the Villanova University. Currently, he lives in New Jersey with his wife and two daughters. However, considering the appointment, Rush Street Gaming did not rule out Lodise's relocation along with his family to the Capital Region.</p>
<p>Famous as upstate New York's "Ultimate Gaming and Entertainment Destination," Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady offers something for everyone. The casino resort provides different gambling options such as slots, table games, video poker and keno, as well as Rivers Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Visitors of the resort can also tap into Rush Rewards, Rush Street's unique loyalty program. Besides gambling, the casino resort offers hotel accommodation as well as plenty of dining and entertainment options.</p>
<p>Before becoming the new general manager of Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady, Lodise served as the general manager and senior vice president at Caesars Atlantic City. During his tenure with the company, he was in charge of a $200-million-dollar renovation project that included not only the hotel, pool and restaurant but the gaming floor as well.
