<p>Realistic Games, a developer of exciting casino games, has agreed to integrate some of its titles into Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino’s platform in Belgium. The agreement will expand the supplier’s presence in the country while providing the operator with new content.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, 20 titles developed by Realistic Games are now live with Napoleon and available to its customers. As a result, local players can now enjoy premium games such as Gorilla Riches, Book of Charms and Realistic’s latest hit, Chilli Master.</p>
<p>The two companies have agreed to add more content to Napoleon’s platform at a later date as its new studio partner continues with its release schedule. Realistic Games has an ambitious roadmap for 2023, planning to release a variety of exciting games that combine thrilling gameplay with great graphics and exciting math models.</p>
<p>One of the titles Realistic Games will be releasing later this year is a refreshed version of its long-time successful Keno game. Furthermore, the studio has also planned to release a fishing-themed slot called Catch 22. Both of these exciting new titles will be integrated into Napoleon’s offering in accordance with the current deal.</p>
<p>Realistic Games Is Happy to Team Up with a Local Market Leader</p>
<p>Realistic Games’ account manager, Amy Brewis, commented on the new agreement. She said that her company always seeks to partner with local market leaders such as Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino. Brewis praised the operator for its “fantastic heritage” in Belgium and said that her team is happy to see its games go live on Napoleon’s platform.</p>
<p>2023 is set to be busy for Realistic and this partnership is one of many we have in the works, backed by an exciting range of new product launches that we’re working on. Amy Brewis, account manager, Realistic Games</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Melissa Deboelpaep, Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino’s gaming content manager, noted that her team is just as excited to have partnered with Realistic Games. The operator is happy to add Realistic’s titles to its offering and, according to Deboelpaep, believes that this integration has greatly enhanced its portfolio.</p>
<p>As a result, players in Belgium will now have an enriched gaming experience when playing with Napoleon. Deboelpaep concluded that her team will engage players in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>At Napoleon, we take pride in offering a safe and responsible environment for our players, and Realistic Games’ commitment to player protection aligns perfectly with our values. We are excited to continue this partnership, delivering top-quality entertainment to our growing community of players. Melissa Deboelpaep, gaming content manager, Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino</p>
<p>In February, Napoleon also secured gambling content from Bragg Gaming.</p>
