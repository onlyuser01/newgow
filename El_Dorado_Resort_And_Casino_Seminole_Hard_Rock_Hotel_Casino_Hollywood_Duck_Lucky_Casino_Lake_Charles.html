    <h1>El Dorado Resort And Casino Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Duck Lucky Casino Lake Charles</h1>

<p>The company usually specializing in niche and premium casino games has expanded its verticals by introducing a classic baccarat game of its own</p>
<p>Gaming Corps now has even more experiences to provide to players and offer partners fresh angles to their iGaming portfolios. The launch of Baccarat by the Swedish developer is based on a very straightforward concept without any additional perks.</p>
<p>New Product Joins Gaming Corps’ Offer</p>
<p>The game follows the basic layout of the classic version which features a Player and Banker Bets, which are the two possible options to bet on. Baccarat is all about guessing which of the two types of bets will yield better results.</p>
<p>There is no obligation to bet on the Player Bet just because you are a “player.” Rather, you pick one of the two based on who you think would get a better hand. Gaming Corps has been launching a number of successful games over the past weeks and months with Baccarat crowing the list now. Commenting on this fresh release, company COO Alex Lorimer said:</p>
<p>The game launches keep coming at Gaming Corps, and I’d like to thank our team for producing a game which passionate traditional casino games players are sure to love. Gaming Corps COO Alex Lorimer</p>
<p>The company itself goes well beyond baccarat or table games. There are other verticals such as crash and mine, as well as slot games. The idea of each design added to the Gaming Corps’ portfolio, argues Lorimer, is to add a new experience and opportunity for players.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has created a number of outstanding titles over the past months, including Jokers Stick and Spin, Luke E. Chance, Book of Luck, Coin Miner 2, Raging Zeus Mines, and frankly, so many others.</p>
<p>Ensuring Brand Growth Through Geographical Reach</p>
<p>Gaming Corps has been moving quickly in iGaming space over the past several months as well. The company managed to secure a B2B license, as part of the country’s re-regulation of the licensure regime which is due to take effect in July.</p>
<p>Meantime, the company has also doubled down on making sure that its content is available to bigger audiences. To this end, the company teamed up with QTech Games, an aggregator with a particular focus on emerging markets in Asia. Not least, Gaming Corps partnered with Coolbet for a single-operator content injection.</p>
