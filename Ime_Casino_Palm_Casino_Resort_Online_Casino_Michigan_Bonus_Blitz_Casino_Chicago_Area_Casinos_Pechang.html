    <h1>Ime Casino Palm Casino Resort Online Casino Michigan Bonus Blitz Casino Chicago Area Casinos Pechang</h1>

<p>The Pechanga Resort and Casino launched a cute new ad to promote its SumoKitty and LuchaKitty slots. It is called 2022 Lucha Kitty World Cuteness Qualifier and features real-life adoptable kittens playing on a wrestling ring.</p>
<p>2022 Lucha Kitty World Cuteness Qualifier</p>
<p>The 4-minute advert is available on Pechanga Resort Casino’s official YouTube channel. The endearing ad features two casters who comment on a “wrestling match” between three kittens. To boost the cute factor, all cats are given wrestling monikers like Purredator, Furry Fury and The Exe-Cute-Tioner.</p>
<p>What’s special about this ad is that all kittens included in the ad are actually adoptable. To elaborate, the animals were rescued by Animal Friends of the Valleys Animal Shelter in Wildomar, California. The World Cuteness Qualifier is a collaborative effort between the shelter company and the Temecula-based casino resort.</p>
<p>Through this new ad, the Pechanga Resort and Casino hopes to both promote its new products and inspire people to help animals in need. It is worth mentioning that Animal Friends of the Valleys has multiple shelters in California, including in Temecula, Wildomar, Murrieta, Menifee, Canyon Lake, Lake Elsinore and others.</p>
<p>The Ad Inspires People to “Help the Greater Good”</p>
<p>Other than prompting Californians to adopt rescued animals, the World Cuteness Qualifier seeks to promote Pechanga’s new slots. The casino resort recently got two new machines, namely Sumo Kitty and Lucha Kitty. Both were produced by the gaming products powerhouse Light &amp; Wonder (formerly Scientific Games).</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez, the vice president of slot operations for Pechanga Resort and Casino, commented on the new advert. He said that the casino is always looking for creative and appealing ways to promote its huge slot floor. However, this new ad goes further as it not only promotes the casino but it also promotes “helping the greater good.”</p>
<p>We hope the campaign helps that many more pets find fur-ever homes. Alex Rodriguez, VP slot operations, Pechanga Resort and Casino</p>
<p>The Pechanga Resort and Casino is a venue operated by the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians. It offers the biggest slots floor in the entire state of California and is the biggest casino on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Beth Soltysiak, the director of Animal Friends of the Valleys, thanked the Pechanga Resort and Casino for being such a reliable partner. She hopes that the new ad will convince bettors to help animals in need and adopt a kitten from one of the organization’s shelters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Animal Friends of the Valleys also offers a variety of services at a reduced price, including spaying and neutering.</p>
