    <h1>Casino In Gulfport Four Jacks Hotel And Casino Wind River Hotel And Casino Island Reels Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Yet another iGaming operator has been cleared for launch in the Netherlands. The Kansspelautoriteit, the Netherlands’ gambling regulator, announced that Smart Gaming has become the 21st licensee in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Smart Gaming Enters the Netherlands</p>
<p>As per the country’s Remote Gambling Act (KOA), Smart Gaming will be allowed to offer online games of chance in the Netherlands. This makes it the 21st operator to launch in the country and the 11th to launch after the initial 10 companies which went live when the Dutch market was regulated.</p>
<p>Despite receiving approval from the KSA, Smart Gaming is yet to announce a domain name under which it will operate. Once Smart Gaming confirms its domain, the authority will write it down in the Netherlands’ Gambling Guide (Kansspelwijzer).</p>
<p>The KSA Continues Working Hard</p>
<p>The current Dutch gambling market was launched around a year ago, on October 1, 2021. At first, only 10 operators were allowed to offer online gambling in the country, but the KSA licensed more at later dates. At the same time, the KSA kicked a few non-compliant companies out of the Netherlands and put them on a cool-off period, which requires them to wait before being able to reapply for a license.</p>
<p>The current gambling regulator is very strict when it comes to the black market and has been working hard to curb offshore brands. The KSA’s relentless crusade against unlicensed brands has yielded results as fewer and fewer such companies are available in the country. Most recently, the Kansspelautoriteit issued an ultimatum to Betworld 247 and LCS Limited, asking them to leave at once or face the consequences for breaching the regulations.</p>
<p>The Authority Realized the Need to Regulate Its Licensees</p>
<p>Recently, the KSA realized that eliminating unlicensed gambling is only half the battle. The authority came to the conclusion that it must also regulate its licensees more strictly and prevent them from bending the rules. For example, a few months ago, the KSA launched an investigation that aims to identify online casino offerings disguised as lotteries. At a later date, René Jansen, the KSA’s chairman, admitted that he believes in stricter regulations and would like to see the introduction of deposit and loss limits. However, that decision ultimately rests with the Dutch government.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the KSA launched a new program to protect its vulnerable players. The Prevention of Gambling Addiction program will see the KSA investigate what causes problem gambling and how it can be prevented. Subsequently, the regulator will use the insights from the research to better protect Dutch bettors from harm.</p>
