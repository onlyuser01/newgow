<p>A new solution will help power ComeOn's Netherlands operations, delivering entertaining experiences and efficiencies for the company</p>
<p>The globally-recognized provider of content for the online gambling industry, Pragmatic Play, announced it expanded its collaboration with ComeOn for the regulated gambling market in the Netherlands. The newly expanded deal, announced Friday, sees Pragmatic’s Chroma Blackjack solution go live in the country with ComeOn.nl.</p>
<p>The developer’s Chroma solution is famous for its customization capabilities that enable operators to engage better with their audiences. Moreover, the solution leverages innovative technologies that help gambling operators control the game environment.</p>
<p>As noted, the new collaboration builds upon a strong foundation between Pragmatic Play and ComeOn. Previously, the two companies have joined forces and enjoyed a successful business relationship which has now expanded. Thanks to that collaboration, a branded Dutch-language table is available for the operator’s players in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to add a unique live dealer experience to our portfolio in the form of a Dutch-language Blackjack table, fully branded via Pragmatic Play’s Chroma solution.“ Cristiano Blanco, chief product officer at ComeOn.nl</p>
<p>Cristiano Blanco, ComeOn.nl’s chief product officer, said that the company is excited to deliver live entertainment for its Dutch players via Pragmatic’s customizable solution. He predicted that the leading solution will help “add value to the entertainment experience of our customers while offering a safe and protected environment, which is our primary focus.” Finally, Blanco said that the company is looking forward to seeing the benefits Pragmatic’s solution will deliver.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow List of Partners</p>
<p>The new deal helps expand further Pragmatic Play’s growing roster of partners. At the same time, the company continues to expand its portfolio of content by delivering new games, as well as solutions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pragmatic inked another important partnership after joining forces with Soccabet in Ghana. This deal helped expand further the developer’s popular portfolio to new audiences.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to build on an already strong partnership with ComeOn to include a branded Dutch-language Blackjack offering for their players in the Netherlands.“ Irina Cornides, chief operating officer at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic’s chief operating officer, spoke about the importance of offering customization options for partners that provide live casino games. Such options, according to her, can elevate the experience for the customers. Finally, Cornides said that Pragmatic is excited to expand its deal with ComeOn for the market in the Netherlands.</p>
