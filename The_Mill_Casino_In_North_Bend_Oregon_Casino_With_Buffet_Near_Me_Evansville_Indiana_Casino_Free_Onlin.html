    <h1>The Mill Casino In North Bend Oregon Casino With Buffet Near Me Evansville Indiana Casino Free Onlin</h1>

<p>Leading US daily fantasy and sportsbook brand DraftKings announced today Gisele Bündchen, a former fashion model and current environmental activist and philanthropist, was appointed as a special advisor to the company’s CEO and Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Impact Will Be Immediate and Far-Reaching</p>
<p>New ESG advisor Gisele Bündchen will collaborate with DraftKings on its commitments to global sustainable development, including climate change, as per its recently released 2020 ESG report, in support of U.N.’s sustainability development goals.</p>
<p>“Gisele Bündchen is a global icon who has utilized the platform she established in modeling, fashion, and entertainment, to lead and advocate for vital environmental and social causes.” Jason Robins, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board, DraftKings</p>
<p>Having set a goal of planting 1 million trees by Earth Day 2022, DraftKings already launched fantasy sports contests and free-to-play pools to provide opportunities for its customers to actively participate in the process and support the company’s effort.</p>
<p>“I believe that the strategic counsel and unique global perspective that Gisele brings to me and the board will be indispensable and, as evidenced by our Earth Day campaign, her impact will be immediate and far-reaching.” Jason Robins, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board, DraftKings</p>
<p>Coordinating its efforts with the Arbor Day Foundation, DraftKings said the first 100,000 trees would be planted in California, Florida, Michigan, Vermont, Virginia and Oregon.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with the DraftKings board of directors in continuing to find ways to make the most positive impacts through meaningful social and environmental initiatives.” Gisele Bündchen</p>
<p>Environment Activist and Ambassador</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Earth Day campaign aligns with the Viva a Vida initiative Gisele Bündchen launched in 2020 which raised funds to plant 260,000 trees in the Amazon Rainforest of her home country Brazil.</p>
<p>Besides it, Bündchen participated in various other environmental and social projects such as the Projeto Agua Limpa (Clean Water Project) which brought sustainable water management systems near her hometown.</p>
<p>Gisele Bündchen was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environmental Program in 2009 and has been serving in the role ever since.</p>
<p>“It is very important for successful corporations to make the necessary shifts in ESG initiatives to truly make a difference on a global level. In today’s world, in my opinion, it isn’t enough for companies to just be successful financially. Companies have to be successful in ALL areas, including social impact and sustainability initiatives that impact the future for all of us around the world.” Gisele Bündchen</p>
<p>Bündchen, whose status as special advisor to the CEO and the Board is effective immediately, has been among the top 100 most influential people and top 100 fashion icons as ranked by Time Magazine, has featured in hundreds of campaigns and graced thousands of magazine covers worldwide, besides walking in nearly 500 fashion shows.</p>
