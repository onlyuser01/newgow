<p>Robert Hoskin was promoted to his current role in 2020 and, a year later, joined the company board as well</p>
<p>Entain, a gaming, betting and entertainment giant, has unveiled changes to its leadership team. As announced by the company, Robert Hoskin, its chief governance officer, will be leaving the company after almost two decades on board.</p>
<p>Hoskin joined Entain in 2005 and now boasts over 18 years with the group. He originally served as company secretary and group director of legal, regulatory and secretariat. In 2020, he was promoted to his current role and, a year later, joined the company board.</p>
<p>Hoskin will retain his position as a board member until June 30 and will remain as chief governance officer until August 31. His responsibilities will be taken on by Simon Zinger, Entain’s acting general counsel, the company announced.</p>
<p>The changes come amid Entain’s decision to restructure certain responsibilities related to Regulatory Affairs. The group seeks to put compliance at the forefront of its business and focus exclusively on regulated gambling markets.</p>
<p>Hoskin Praised Entain’s Progress</p>
<p>Robert Hoskin released a statement on the matter, praising the company for its extraordinary transformation. He noted that Entain currently boasts “strong credentials as a best-in-class, responsible operator” that is backed by an experienced leadership team. In addition, the company is now fully committed to sustainability in all its forms, Hoskin said.</p>
<p>I am truly honored to have had the opportunity of playing a part in that extraordinary journey, and wish everyone at Entain all the best for the future. Robert Hoskin, outgoing chief governance officer, Entain</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, Entain’s chief executive officer, also shared her thoughts, wishing Hoskin all the best. She noted that he had been “supportive, welcoming and helpful” to her when she joined Entain as a NED in 2019.</p>
<p>He has played an instrumental role in making Entain the success story that it is today, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to him for everything that he has done for me personally and the Group more widely. Jette Nygaard-Andersen, CEO, Entain</p>
<p>Finally, Barry Gibson, chair of Entain, said that Hoskin had been central to the implementation of Entain’s sustainability plans. He saluted him as a great colleague and thanked him for his service.</p>
<p>Hoskin’s exit follows an update of Entain’s board and the creation of two new committees, namely the People &amp; Governance Committee and the Sustainability &amp; Compliance Committee.</p>
<p>According to Gibson, the newly-introduced changes will further diversify the company’s board.</p>
