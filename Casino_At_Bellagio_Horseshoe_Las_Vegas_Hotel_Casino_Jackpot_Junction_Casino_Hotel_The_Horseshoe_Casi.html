<p>Paysafe is extending its partnership for payment options with betPARX, a wagering and gaming platform owned by Greenwood Gaming Entertainment, Inc. The pair are already familiar with each other’s work as Paysafe is already available for the Play Gun Lake in Michigan, a retail and interactive gaming property that uses the betPARX solutions.</p>
<p>The new integration is facilitated through Playtech, which is the select technology partner for betPARX and which powers the gaming offer at the properties in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Playtech makes this possible through the deployment of its dedicated Information Management Solution (IMS) platform.</p>
<p>As a result, betPARX users can now benefit from Paysafe’s tested, reliable, and lightning-fast payment options which work with the Skrill USA wallet, the Paysafecash, and paysafecard eCash options. The Paysafe solutions are used both for deposits and withdrawals, giving a well-rounded experience to consumers interested in placing a wager.</p>
<p>Thanks to Skrill USA, a consumer may request quick cash out of their winnings in the designated transactional limit if such applies. Paysafe CEO for NA iGamingZak Cutler welcomed the opportunity to be consolidating the company’s presence in the sector. Cutler welcomed the opportunity to be joining both New Jersey and Pennsylvania and assist people interested in iGaming experiences.</p>
<p>He specifically hailed New Jersey as a "cornerstone" state which has helped the rest of the US catch up to iGaming. Commenting on the addition of Paysafe, betPARX SVP of interactive Matthew Cullen added that the company was proud to be hosting the payment solutions.</p>
<p>"We constantly look for features that will round out our service to users and make betPARX the simplest and fastest app, and Paysafe delivers easy and user-friendly deposit and cash-out options," Cullen added, saying that betPARX trusts Paysafe as one of the best brands in the United States for providing powerful payment solutions for iGaming options.</p>
<p>BetPARX launched in New Jersey and Pennsylvania a little over two weeks ago. The company was happy to bring both sports betting and iGaming options to both the Garden and Keystone States which are a central hubs for iGaming. Previously, betPARX launched in Michigan, with all three states proving some of the most populous iGaming and interactive gambling options.</p>
