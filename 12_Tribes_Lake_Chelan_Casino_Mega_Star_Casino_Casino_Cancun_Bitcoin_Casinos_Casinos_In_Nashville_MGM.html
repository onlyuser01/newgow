<p>The operator reaffirmed its commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, complementing its advocacy campaigns and ongoing efforts to support its diverse workforce</p>
<p>Leading global hospitality and entertainment company MGM Resorts proudly announced its continued support for the LGBTQ+ community by returning as the presenting sponsor of the annual Las Vegas Pride Parade. This iteration marks the 17th consecutive year of the operator sponsoring the event, demonstrating its unwavering commitment to promoting inclusivity and equality.</p>
<p>The Company Has Been a Staunch Supporter of Diversity</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has a rich history of supporting the LGBTQ+ community, with its involvement in the Las Vegas Pride Parade dating back to 2003. Over the years, the company has consistently shown its dedication to fostering a more inclusive world. As part of its sponsorship, MGM Resorts employees will actively participate in the parade, proudly marching alongside the company’s float.</p>
<p>The company offers enduring support for its LGBTQ+ workforce by providing free resources to help employees access quality healthcare. MGM Resorts has consistently advocated for LGBTQ+ human rights, championing equality and inclusivity. Chief People, Inclusion &amp; Sustainability Officer Jyoti Chopra noted that the company’s participation in the annual parade was a natural extension of its efforts to foster inclusivity and equality.</p>
<p>We are proud to reaffirm our support for the LGBTQ+ community and celebrate love in all its forms. Jyoti Chopra, MGM Resorts Chief People, Inclusion &amp; Sustainability Office</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has been at the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights and inclusivity. In 2004, the company demonstrated its commitment by becoming one of the first organizations in the gaming and hospitality industry to provide same-sex health benefits to its employees. Additionally, MGM Resorts has offered same-sex ceremonies at its chapels, further advocating for LGBTQ+ rights.</p>
<p>Social Responsibility Remains a Driving Principle</p>
<p>The operator’s dedication to promoting equality has earned recognition from the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). The HRC has acknowledged MGM Resorts as one of the nation’s “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.” Furthermore, the company has achieved a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index for 11 consecutive years.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ support for the annual Las Vegas Pride Parade perfectly aligns with its community-focused mindset. The MGM Resorts Foundation recently awarded $2.7 million to worthy causes, showcasing its continued dedication to fostering positive change. These funds contributed to tackling pressing concerns like homelessness, aiding veterans and military families, addressing food insecurity, advancing education, and promoting health and wellness initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite recent setbacks, MGM Resorts remains at the forefront of the gaming industry, thanks in no small part to its long history of advocacy and promoting inclusivity. The company’s participation in the Las Vegas Pride Parade for the 17th consecutive year reaffirms its unwavering commitment to supporting and celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, helping it stand apart from the competition.</p>
