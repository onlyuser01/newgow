    <h1>Island Reels Casino Casino Royale Theme Hotels Near Winstar Casino With Shuttle Casinos Near Palm Sp</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I received an email from Lucky Legend Casino on the 1 February 2024 inviting me to use a $200 free chip on their casino site. In the past i have been refused bonus after i have played and wagered the amount requested. I decided to put the deposit in first to ensure that i would not break any of their rules. Today i Deposited $30 and played and did not win any money to withdraw. I then proceeded to the email and clicked on the promotion and was taken to the site. I received this message when i tried to claim the bonus: WE ARE SORRY,</p>
<p>The coupon code "HOUSE200" was declined</p>
<p>Reason: Maximum uses per player exceeded.</p>
<p>I have contacted their online agent and was informed that i had claimed this promotion already on 10/08/2023. I have a few questions regarding this: Why send me a promotion that i have already used? I am registered with multiple online casinos. I cannot remember which bonus i have used and when. If i have used a bonus or a promotion why send the same bonus / promotion to me months later. I have laid 2 complaints with other casino's and lost those complaints and was not happy. Now when i follow the instructions to the letter i still loose. If they had not sent me this email, i would have used my $30 on another site with the same promotion.</p>
<p>Please can you address this with the casino, i would like to receive the bonus that was sent to me on the 01 February 2024. If they cannot do this, then they must refund my $30 into my wallet.</p>
<p>This is underhanded from a casino to do something like this.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen F***</p>
