<p>Hi Tomas,</p>
<p>Many thanks for getting back to me. I can shed more light on your questions:</p>
<p>Could you please explain if your winnings were achieved with the help of a bonus?</p>
<p>No, I didn't claim a bonus and all the wagering had been completed. When I requested a withdrawal, they told me I needed to make a deposit via another payment method and wager x3 as somehow bank card withdrawals were not available. Just to be clear, withdrawals to bank cards were available up to this point. I've come across this tactic before, so when I said that it was not fair, my account was blocked mid-chat.</p>
<p>Have you requested your account to be reopened after it was blocked? Which games have you played in the casino? (slots, live games, multiplayer)</p>
<p>I did, but since my account is blocked, they only reply to me via email and refuse to deal with me via chat. I asked why the account was blocked. They replied that my account was closed as requested. When I pointed out that I didn't request an account closure, they told me that they would be looking into it, but they refused to address the fact that I had money in the account. I was playing slots only. All wagering was met, so there was absolutely no reason for this.</p>
