<p>WynnBET has secured another important market access and entry deal, this time in West Virginia. The iGaming and sports betting arm for the luxury hospitality company Wynn Resorts have successfully struck a multi-year collaboration with Delaware North, opening up access to the West Virginia market where the brand will run a dedicated casino and online sportsbook operations.</p>
<p>With this move, West Virginia marks the 18th jurisdiction in which WynnBET is allowed to establish a presence. While WynnBET doesn’t have full access to all of its markets, the company’s goal is to launch its full-scale offer in each jurisdiction, subject to regulatory approval. Most recently, the company entered Louisiana and Arizona.</p>
<p>Delaware North is an apt partner for the company as it is a global hospitality and entertainment entity with a strong footprint in the state and beyond. The company operates the Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino Racetrack in Wheeling and the Mardi Gras Casino &amp; Resort in Nitro, giving WynnBET access to two on-site locations in WV.</p>
<p>WynnBET has been actively seeking to expand its footprint and reach. The company already caters to an estimated 44% of the US population across the 18 states that it now covers. Wynn is also looking to launch in seven more states, which would position it in proximity to 77% of the US adult population, paving the way for new iGaming and interactive wagering opportunities.</p>
<p>WynnBET is fairly late to some of these jurisdictions with iGaming launching in West Virginia back in July 2020, spearheaded by DraftKings first. However, WynnBET has been methodically building up its footprint in the United States, positioning itself to continually secure a bigger market share.</p>
<p>In the meantime, WynnBET has been scaling up its offer with fan bases through a series of meticulous partnerships with prominent franchises across the US. The company has a newly-minted collaboration with the Colorado Rockies of MLB.</p>
<p>Prior to signing up with the Rockies, WynnBET teamed up with the Cincinnati Reds, another MLB franchise, and the company struck a partnership with NFL franchise the Memphis Grizzlies in Tennessee in May.</p>
