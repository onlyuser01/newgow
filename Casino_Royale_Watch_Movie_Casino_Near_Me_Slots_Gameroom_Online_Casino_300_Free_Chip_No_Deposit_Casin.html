<p>The National Basketball League of Canada NBL has teamed up with IMG Arena with the latter company becoming the official data supplier for the company. This comes as part of a multi-year arrangement between the two organizaitons.</p>
<p>Distributing Big Data for Additional Value</p>
<p>Moving forward, IMG Arena will tap into the league data feeds. The company has been established as a subsidiary of Endeavor for the purposes of developing betting technology and collecting sports data in real-time, which is then distributed back to partner brands.</p>
<p>IMG Arena Alliance’s network already features more than 460 sportsbooks which benefit from feeds from over 80 sporting leagues and organizaitons across the world, all delivered by the firm’s advanced technological solutions. The company is also licensed to live stream sports and offer the accompanying data.</p>
<p>This should lead to better engagement between fans and the NBL Canada. The league will capitalize on its strongest asset which is its data to galvanize people to tune in, watch and even bet, creating a comprehensive and multi-layered experience. The partnership will kick in as early as the 2022 season and will cover the full length of the competition from beginning to end.</p>
<p>To help move the data, IMG Arena will rely on its partners, namely SBTech, Kambi Group, and Paddy Power which will inject it directly into the sportsbooks keen on covering the NBL Canada season. Commenting on this partnership, Audley Stephenson, the VP of operations for NBL Canada, said:</p>
<p>This is an important step for NBL Canada as we move into the sports betting realm and it’s an honor to do so with such a respected and experienced partner in this space. Audley Stephenson, the VP of operations for NBL Canada</p>
<p>IMG Arena is an important partner for NBL Canada, as the company is capable of processing a huge number of sports events every year with some 45,000 competitions covered.</p>
<p>Improving the Performance of Individual Teams</p>
<p>IMG Arena further has a number of professional tools that are developed for the purposes of assisting sports organizaitons, beyond gambling agencies, to optimize their performance through the collation and analysis of big data.</p>
<p>Talking about the partnership opportunity, IMG Arena rights director Mark Wrigley hailed the partnership with NBL Canada as an important milestone for the company. Wrigley was pleased that after looking for a suitable partner, NBL Canada has gone with IMG Arena.</p>
<p>The executive is confident that IMG Arena and NBL Canada will work together on helping the league increase its reach and engagement with fans from across the world.</p>
