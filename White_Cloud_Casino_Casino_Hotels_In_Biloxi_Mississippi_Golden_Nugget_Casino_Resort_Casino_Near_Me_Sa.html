    <h1>White Cloud Casino Casino Hotels In Biloxi Mississippi Golden Nugget Casino Resort Casino Near Me Sa</h1>

<p>Good evening. I requested a withdrawal on the 6th of November 2022.</p>
<p>Not only did I verify all the relevant information and I probably deposited over R10 000 in deposits.</p>
<p>I met all the wagering requirements and made sure everything was done by the book.</p>
<p>The declined my withdrawal today stating that my proof of address was older than three months. Which is not the case.</p>
<p>They requested that I resubmit a newer version. The verification page won't allow me to upload a newer version of my proof of payment.</p>
<p>However the guys in chat says all is good and my account is verified and that the withdrawal will now take another 5 days before it is reviewed by the accounts department. I asked if he can confirm if everything is in order for my withdrawal to be made in 5 days time and he said I can't confirm anything as it's accounts who have to do the review and make sure everything is fine. So in total I will be waiting for about two weeks to get my withdrawal. Based on the complaints of this casino I will never see my money. They are constantly trying to find ways of screwing people over.</p>
<p>I have attached some info here.</p>
<p>Please see below the email I sent them. I can guarantee anyone and even bet my house that this week when it's time for my withdrawal as per their timeframes they will come up with a new story to not pay my f<strong>*</strong>g money.</p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p>I made a withdrawal request last week. As far as I know my account was verified in terms of address as well as my identity when I uploaded my documents.</p>
<p>You guys declined my withdrawal this morning stating that my utility bill was older than three months. You then requested that I upload a new proof of address that is recent. However your website does not allow me to upload a new updated proof of address.</p>
<p>I have tried many times. My account status at the moment says everything is verified. The people in the chat says my documents are now on file but they don't want to tell me if my documents and information is correct.</p>
<p>I am attaching my updated proof of address to this email so that you have a copy of my details.</p>
<p>As far as I know my proof of address was not older than three months.</p>
<p>I have now made a new withdrawal request. I unfortunately need to wait another five days for my withdrawal. Please don't give me a new excuse in five days time.</p>
<p>Please confirmation from the chat that this gentleman has agreed and confirmed that my account is verified and that my information is correct.</p>
<p>Thanks. Have a great day.</p>
