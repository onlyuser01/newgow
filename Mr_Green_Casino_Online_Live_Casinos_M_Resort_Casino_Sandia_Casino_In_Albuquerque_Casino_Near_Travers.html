<p>Design Works Gaming (DWG) has been approved to launch its iGaming portfolio on the market in Connecticut. This makes a fourth state in which the company has been licensed to deliver its distinguished portfolio of products, including New Jersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>DWG Adds to iGaming Content Variety in US</p>
<p>As interest in iGaming continues to grow, so is a hunger for more unique games. The United States iGaming businesses still offer a fraction of what their European counterparts run in terms of game variety and pure numbers. This is partly because not all suppliers have not yet been licensed to conduct business in the United States. The fragmented nature of the licensing process each state sets out as an entry barrier is another contributing factor.</p>
<p>Regardless, DWG has been able to clear the final hurdle to access the iGaming market in Connecticut. The company has received its accreditation from Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection. Commenting on this success, the company CEO Troy Zurawski said:</p>
<p>“Securing our license in Connecticut in record time and being one of the first independent game developers to do so is just another feat for us.” Design Works Gaming CEO Troy Zurawski</p>
<p>Zurawski added that the company’s launch in New Jersey has inspired DWG to be all systems go from there on in. DWG has been able to deliver its product across a number of established casino brands, including Resorts Casino and Golden Nugget Online Gaming. The company is keeping its eyes peeled for more opportunities out in the iGaming market as several draft bills will be trying to find their way through the state legislature this year.</p>
<p>Connecticut is one of the latest markets to launch iGaming. The state granted iGaming licenses back in October. Michigan and Pennsylvania are another two bastions of iGaming. Both have posted strong results eclipsing sports betting in terms of total revenue generated for each respectively.</p>
