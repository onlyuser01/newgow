    <h1>Online Casino Best Casino In Louisiana Las Vegas And Casino Mgm Casino Springfield California Online</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Stake.com are a crypto-based casino. I had deposited around $2000 and waited for it to come through. I open the website and see nothing is in my balance although the deposit was confirmed. I look at my recent bets and see live blackjack and Stake Originals Roulette. I checked my email and someone had tried to withdraw these funds but luckily I have a withdrawal code sent to my email before a withdrawal is confirmed so they couldn't withdraw. They then decide to spend their money for fun on their casino games. I contact their live support and show them the screenshot of the withdrawal request they made which I still have. There was also another session on my account somewhere in Romania. Usually, when logging into Stake they send a login code via email and another email saying a new session has started. I hadn't received this whenever the infiltrator logged into my account either because he bypassed it or for any other valid reason. I explain all of this to their live support but they do not help and reply by saying sorry there is nothing we can do. I have a download of the chat with them if required. A picture of the session that was not me and the picture of the email with the withdrawal request. This is unacceptable hence why I actively searched for websites to complain and see if we can take this further as $2000 is a lot of money and they weren't withdrawn and stolen they were just spent on the site but without my authorisation. For your information, my account is now secure with 2fa and I changed my password. Hopefully, we can find a way to obtain my funds back.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Andrew M***</p>
