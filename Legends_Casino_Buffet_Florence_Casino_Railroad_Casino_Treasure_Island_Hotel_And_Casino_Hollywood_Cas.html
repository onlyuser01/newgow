<p>Anticipating closing the acquisition of the Mirage until the end of the year, Hard Rock International (HRI), announced it made a major step forward last week, after securing approval for the purchase from the gambling regulator in Nevada</p>
<p>Back in December 2021, Hard Rock announced its plans to purchase The Mirage from MGM Resorts in a deal of some $1.08 billion.</p>
<p>Nevada Gambling Regulator Greenlights HRI’s Purchase of the Mirage</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company made an important step forward as the gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), recommended the acquisition to be completed. Last week Friday, the Board green-lighted the acquisition, clearing the path for the purchase of the property by Hard Rock.</p>
<p>The company’s chairman, James Allen, shared his excitement in a press release. He thanked the Nevada Gaming Control Board, as well as the Nevada Gaming Commission for the approvals which allowed the company to secure a license for The Mirage. Allen explained that Hard Rock is looking forward to finalizing the acquisition of the property. Finally, he said that the company is looking forward to adding some 3,500 new members to its growing team at Hard Rock.</p>
<p>“Today, we’d like to express our gratitude to the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission for approving the gaming license for us to operate The Mirage Hotel and Casino.“ James Allen, chairman at Hard Rock International</p>
<p>The Mirage Remains Open, HRI Plans Reconstruction</p>
<p>The latest announcement came after earlier this month, HRI rejected reports claiming that upon purchasing The Mirage the property will be closed. At the time, the company explained that it plans to renovate and overhaul the venue. However, it said that it has “no current plans to cease operation of The Mirage and any reporting to the contrary is inaccurate.”</p>
<p>Hard Rock pointed out that a temporary closure of the soon-to-be-acquired property may happen in mid-2024 in light of the planned construction works. Still, the operator said that additional details can be expected at some point in 2023.</p>
<p>“We do not have definitive plans to close the property at this time, but for full transparency, that could be an option a year and a half down the road,“ explained Allen earlier this month</p>
<p>As a part of the plan to renovate The Mirage, HRI plans to increase the number of slots available at the property. Additionally, the company revealed its plans to introduce more table games, expand the number of hotel rooms and introduce more amenities.</p>
