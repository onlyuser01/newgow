<p>You are in safe hands We guarantee that all sites listed on GamblingNews.com are safe, legitimate, and secure operators that will help bring out the best possible iGaming experience.

Legal and regulated</p>
<p>SSL-encrypted</p>
<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>BetOnline is one of the leading betting agencies in the United States, covering an extensive variety of early markets, futures, and offering competitive odds. The esports selection is adequately stacked and available in both Chinese and English, giving a global audience the opportunity to place an esports bet.</p>
<p>Esports fans who choose BetOnline can pick from 10-odd esports betting markets, including FIFA, Counter-Strike, League of Legends, Dota 2, Overwatch, Rainbow Six and others. The website has dedicated esports promotions and competitive odds. You stand to benefit from a 20% weekly esports rebate, and more.</p>
<p>BetOnline Esports 20% Weekly Rebate</p>
<p>BetOnline Esports still has some way to go in introducing a comprehensive esports betting offer. Yet, the sportsbook has not missed featuring some excellent markets and not least a 20% weekly esports rebate, which bettors will no doubt appreciate.</p>
<p>The bonus terms and conditions are straightforward. Esports bettors will benefit from 20% of their losses paid back to them for any weekly losses exceeding $250. It’s a neat safety net that allows you to regenerate some of the funds you have won.</p>
<p>However, the rebate will only apply to casino games, which may not be to the immediate taste of most esports fans. Either way, it’s always neat to know that you have the option.</p>
<p>BetOnline Esports Markets You Can Bet On</p>
<p>While BetOnline may lack a bit in the esports bonus department, the available markets are perfectly calibrated to the needs and preferences of bettors. The website presently offers nine markets, with more in the making. You can bet freely on any competition that takes place in multiple games, including:</p>
<p>FIFA</p>
<p>Counter-Strike</p>
<p>League of Legends</p>
<p>Dota 2</p>
<p>Warcraft 3</p>
<p>Rainbow Six</p>
<p>Starcraft II</p>
<p>Starcraft Broodwar</p>
<p>Overwatch</p>
<p>For a non-endemic betting agency, BetOnline successfully blends many mainstream video games with less familiar markets. Gamers can usually pick from several bet types, including 1×2, HDP, and map winner, but there are often various proposition bets.</p>
<p>Bettors will find interesting and value-added markets such as correct score, total rounds, winner round, and more. Naturally, the available bets will vary based on what game you are picking on, with BetOnline calibrating its offer accordingly.</p>
<p>Competitive Odds, Plenty of Lines: Why People Come Back to BetOnline</p>
<p>While BetOnline certainly doesn’t put a lot of marketing effort into the esports section, it tends to it generously. We have run a comparison between the available odds and lines at BetOnline and other esports betting agencies to conclude that BetOnline is competitive and often offers slightly better value.</p>
<p>This is especially true for US players, but also anyone who is not on the website’s list of restricted countries. Restrictions aside, BetOnline is pretty generous in offering a selection of markets. You can calibrate the types of bets you want to place based on:</p>
<p>Early Markets</p>
<p>Futures</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Clearly, the Results category is more of a utility/informational place on the website from where you can look up live esports results or see how an event has ended. You can further tinker with the odds and pick from American, Decimal, Fractional and Hong Kong odds, all of which are slightly different and adjustable so as to offer maximum comfort to bettors.</p>
<p>BetOnline Reputation for Safety</p>
<p>With esports fans being a suspicious lot, you can imagine that any website that wants to run a credible esports product will have to meet the high standards set by the community. BetOnline has some success in establishing a good reputation for itself. The website is often discussed and cited as a trusted betting agency, especially in Reddit discussions.</p>
<p>As reviewers who have been following the gambling industry for years, BetOnline has also repeatedly come up, giving us reasons to trust it. Today, BetOnline Esports operates according to the highest industry standards designed to protect players.</p>
<p>This includes SSL encryption, a responsible gambling practice in place, and running basic KYC and AML checks. The confirmation of players’ identity is necessary so as to avoid underage gambling from taking place.</p>
<p>Deposit and Withdrawals at BetOnline</p>
<p>BetOnline will make sure that esports enthusiasts have no trouble depositing or withdrawing from the website. Anyone who wishes to deposit can do so quickly and efficiently choosing from a number of viable payment methods, including:</p>
<p>Visa</p>
<p>MasterCard</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Skrill</p>
<p>Neteller</p>
<p>Person to Person</p>
<p>Other payment options also exist, and especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Some players may find Ethereum, Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash a more appropriate cryptocurrency to cash out with, but this is entirely up to the player.</p>
<p>There are no fees for deposits and as to withdrawals, you can rely on quick cash outs that will take less than 48 hours. A word of caution for anyone who has decided to withdraw with a Bank Wire, though.</p>
<p>The withdraw may incur a fee, so it’s best to stick with alternative payment options as cryptocurrencies. The maximum withdrawal you can request is $3,000 per single transaction.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>BetOnline also offers dedicated 24/7 customer support you can reach out whenever you need it. Players are welcome to jump in a live chat with a customer care rep or just send an email to [email protected]. There is also a phone you can call if you prefer. Feel free to dial 1-888-426-3661 for additional help. Most esports bettors prefer to stick with live chat as it’s both the most impersonal, but also offers the quickest turnaround to any issue.</p>
<p>Verdict: BetOnline Esports Is Worth It</p>
<p>BetOnline is a great esports betting portal. Even though the brand doesn’t host its own fully dedicated section on competitive video gaming, you will find some great odds and lines.</p>
<p>You will be able to pick from seven titles and some interesting and underrepresented markets such as Starcraft Broodwar and Warcraft III, not to mention staples such as Dota 2, Counter-Strike, League of Legends, FIFA and Overwatch. Overall, BetOnline Esports feels and behaves like a dedicated and trustworthy esports betting authority you can trust.</p>
<p>If you are not quite sure whether this is the correct choice for yourself, we highly recommend that you head right over Reddit and ask your fellow gamers.</p>
