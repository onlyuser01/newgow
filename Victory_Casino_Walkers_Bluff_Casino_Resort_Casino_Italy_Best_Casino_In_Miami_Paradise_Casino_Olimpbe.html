<p>The leading sports betting and gaming operator in Kazakhstan, Olimpbet, announced a new deal, allowing it to enter into the esports betting vertical. Last week, the company unveiled details regarding a collaboration with Oddin.gg, the leading business-to-business (B2B) supplier of esports betting solutions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, Olimpbet has gone live with esports betting, powered by Oddin.gg's leading iFrame solution. The solution offers not only trading but risk management options, making it perfect for operators that want to enter the esports betting vertical.</p>
<p>To start offering esports betting, Olimpbet has seamlessly integrated Oddin.gg's solutions. This enabled the leading operator in Kazakhstan to start offering esports betting, expanding further the offering available for its customers. At the same time, the operator's entry into the esports vertical is expected to further help solidify its leadership position within the market in the country.</p>

This enabled the operator, which is a member of the German-based Gauselmann Group, to expand its offering by delivering options for esports betting to its growing customer base.</p>
