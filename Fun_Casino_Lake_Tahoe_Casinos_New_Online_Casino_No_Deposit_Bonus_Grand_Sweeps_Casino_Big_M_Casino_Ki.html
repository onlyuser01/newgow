<p>Kindred-owned sportsbook Unibet has launched sports betting in Arizona, thanks to a 10-year partnership between Kindred and the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. This marks the sixth state where the sportsbook is operational.</p>
<p>Unibet Goes Live in Arizona</p>
<p>Bettors in Arizona can already use the mobile Unibet sportsbook app just in time for the National Football League. A land-based sportsbook will be opening up at a later date.</p>
<p>Kindred’s senior vice-president, Manuel Stan, revealed that his company is “extremely pleased” to have gotten one of the only ten tribal licenses available in Arizona. Thanks to this, Unibet will be among the first operators that launch in the state and will have a head start thanks to the ongoing National Football League.</p>
<p>“Arizona’s passion for sports is unmatched, and through our great partnership with the Quechan Tribe, we’re excited to first provide a mobile sportsbook experience for sports fans of all levels with retail to follow,” Stan revealed.</p>
<p>He hopes to build strong and lasting relationships with the Quechan Tribe for the best benefit of both parties. Stan also added that Kindred envisions a California expansion when the market regulates.</p>
<p>Unibet sportsbook promises to have a lot of promotions concerning various sporting events in Arizona. Kindred as a whole is a company that tries to offer good quality offerings to its customers. In the second quarter of 2021, it had an estimate of around 4.3% of its revenues from problem gamblers. The operator is currently taking action to reduce the number of gambling-related harm instances.</p>
<p>The Quechan Expect Tribal Structures to Benefit from the Launch of Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation also made a statement. Its president Jordan D Joaquin said that the tribe is looking forward to working together with Kindred Group and also hopes to establish strong relations with the company.</p>
<p>Joaquin explained that the mobile and retail sportsbooks in Arizona are expected to bring “additional economic development opportunities and benefits to the tribe”. The revenue from the wagers will help the natives improve the lifestyle of their community.</p>
<p>Arizona sports betting was approved and launched on September 9, coinciding with the beginning of the National Football League. Several operators like Unibet got the chance to pioneer the state’s fresh sports betting market. Some of them include DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, among others.</p>
<p>With Arizona being a state that has numerous sports professionals, sports betting is expected to boom. It admittedly faced some opposition, mainly from the Yavapai-Prescott tribe, but is currently proceeding with full steam ahead.</p>
