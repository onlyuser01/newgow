<p>Vegas Magic review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Of all the types of magic show, Vegas Magic shows are undoubtedly the most annoying. The look-at-me style of the street magician is amplified one-thousandfold by the glitz and sparkle of the Vegas stage.</p>
<p>So why anyone would make a slot machine based on it is a mystery as deep as a magician’s rabbit filled hat.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Win in the Vegas Magic slot machine</p>
<p>The graphics are bright and engaging in the same blue and pink light that is favoured by Vegas acts. The actual symbols, however, are rather bland and lack the kind of stand out look you would need to pull a theme like this off.</p>
<p>The various animations are flashy but a little clunky, and the soundtrack is an intensely annoying mix of intrusive stage music and the most standard slot machine noises out there.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Vegas Magic is a five by three slot with twenty win lines.</p>
<p>Its main feature is the tumbling stacks which occur whenever the player wins. Any winning symbols vanish in a puff of magic and new symbols fall down from above, offering the player another chance to hit some winning combos.</p>
<p>With no bonus features or games the rest of the gameplay is a little dull.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. If a Wild joins a reel during a tumble, it expands to fill the entire reel.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol pays out from wherever it lands. You just have to hit three or more in one spin. It pays five times your bet per spin for three, and adds a 10x multiplier for each subsequent Scatter; all the way up to five hundred times your bet per spin for five Scatters.</p>
<p>There are no bonus games in Vegas Magic.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.08%, almost exactly the same as our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Vegas Magic slot</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies which tend to use slots of the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Vegas Magic does not get off to a good start with its title, and it is all downhill from there. Characterless design and annoying music add together with dull gameplay to alienate the player.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the middling volatility and average return to player are doing nothing to attract the player’s coins.</p>
<p>Vegas Magic does not get a recommendation from us, and neither does this slot.</p>
