<p>Last year, Maine embarked on the path to legalizing sports gambling when Gov. Janet Mills signed a bill in May 2022</p>
<p>Maine is set to join the ranks of states where sports gambling becomes legal starting on November 3. The culmination of months of planning and deliberation, the state’s Department of Public Safety announced the eagerly awaited news on October 31, indicating that the official launch would take place at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>The Roadmap to Maine’s Legalized Sports Gambling Success</p>
<p>The journey toward legalized sports gambling in Maine began last year when Gov. Janet Mills signed a bill in May 2022, granting legal status to sports wagering in the state. However, Maine took a deliberate and cautious approach, ensuring detailed rules for the operation of sports betting were thoroughly examined and revised by the Maine Gambling Control Unit. These rules, published in January, underwent public scrutiny and were eventually approved, paving the way for the launch.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, bettors must be 21 years or older to participate in sports gambling activities. The state is gearing up for a digital revolution in the gambling industry, with mobile and online wagering expected to dominate the market, reported the Portland Press Herald.</p>
<p>Maine’s online sports betting market will be controlled by the state’s Indigenous tribes, specifically the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Micmac, and Maliseet nations. These tribes will have exclusive rights to operate mobile sports betting apps, securing 50% or more of the mobile revenue. Meanwhile, the state will receive 10% in taxes, and a fraction will contribute to federal taxes.</p>
<p>Major Gambling Operators Team Up with Maine Tribes</p>
<p>Several major gambling operators, including DraftKings, have inked agreements with tribal partners, eager to tap into Maine’s burgeoning sports betting market. The state’s cautious approach has garnered praise from experts, emphasizing the importance of meticulous planning in the face of a rapidly expanding industry.</p>
<p>Despite the anticipation, some physical locations, including retail betting outlets, will not be immediately ready to accommodate bettors. Favorites Off-Track Betting (OTB) is currently relocating its Waterville venue and renovating its Sanford location. Additionally, the Cumberland County location, set to operate sports betting at the Cumberland Fairgrounds, is still undergoing preparations and might not be operational until December or later.</p>
<p>Despite the 10% tax on sports wagering revenue and limited advertising, Caesars swiftly secured partnerships with three tribes, the Houlton Band, Mi’kmaq, and Penobscot tribes, dominating three-quarters of the online market. Maine’s entry into the sports gambling arena marks a significant moment for the state, aligning it with over 30 others in the United States that have embraced legalized sports betting.</p>
