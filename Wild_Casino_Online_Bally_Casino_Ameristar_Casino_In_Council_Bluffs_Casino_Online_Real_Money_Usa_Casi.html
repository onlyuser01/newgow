<p>Evolution signs a landmark deal with JVH Gaming &amp; Entertainment Group to supply the leading Dutch operator with state-of-the-art live casino content and products as early as September 1, 2021.</p>
<p>JVH Taps in Evolution’s Live Casino Content Expertise for Dutch Market</p>
<p>Evolution is moving into the Netherlands with a brand new live casino content deal and services with JVH Gaming &amp; Entertainment Group (NVH group), the company has announced. The leading supplier and developer of live casino games, which recently acquired the world’s preeminent slot developer NetEnt, has picked JVH Group’s as a partner because of the Dutch company’s own expertise in the private casino market.</p>
<p>JVH group is a household in the Dutch market and clocks over four million visits every year spread across 80 properties and numerous brands, including Jack’s Casino, the Netherlands’ best-known gaming brand.</p>
<p>As a result of the tie-up, JVH group will be able to access Evolution’s full portfolio of innovative, award-winning live games, including First Person RNG titles, but also numerous other iterations that improve on the traditional casino experience.</p>
<p>Evolution will bring its range of Game Shows and lightning series games, with Lighting Dice and Roulette, Crazy Time and Monopoly Live, just a few of the worthwhile consumer choices moving forward.</p>
<p>Evolution Plans a September Launch for Portfolio</p>
<p>As per the agreement, Evolution will go live on Jack’s Casino on September 1, 2021, which coincides with the current date set by the government to fully regulate the online gambling market. To prepare for the upcoming expansion, Evolution will prepare a special part of its studio dedicated entirely for the Jack’s Casino brand.</p>
<p>Executives from both companies are happy with the current developments. JVH group CEO and Chairman Eric Olders noted that despite delays, the market is finally going to achieve a regulated status, opening a world of opportunities. For JVH’s part, Olders was confident that the wait is worthwhile.</p>
<p>“I can promise our players that the live gaming experience they will be able to enjoy at our online casino will be well worth the wait.” – JVH group CEO and Chairman Eric Olders</p>
<p>He described Evolution’s game portfolio as “world-class” and noted that players will have an exceptional online mix of casino classics as well as the more innovative show-style entertainment product that has become Evolution’s signature style.</p>
<p>Improving the Brick-and-Mortar Experience</p>
<p>Olders believes that the partnership with Evolution will allow consumers to enjoy new experiences and not just replicate a simple visit to a brick-and-mortar casino. “In Evolution, we are confident that we have found a trusted partner to make this happen,” Olders concluded.</p>
<p>Evolution Chief Commercial Officer Johan Nordstrom said that the company was proud to be joining hands with JVH group, and contribute to the 60-year heritage JVH brings with it. “We very much look forward to achieving high levels of success through a close partnership with them in this new and extremely exciting online market,” he added optimistically.</p>
<p>Evolution’s footprint has been growing quickly around the world. The company entered the Colombian market with Zamba, a local operator, and rolled out live content in Pennsylvania with BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse, both owned by Rush Street Interactive, and hammered out a separate partnership with DraftKings.</p>
