<p>The leading sports betting and iGaming operator, BetMGM, announced a partnership expansion with the leading live sports wagering streaming video network SportsGrid. The announcement came Tuesday and sees the duo expand their existing strategic collaboration.</p>
<p>Under the newly announced partnership expansion, broadcasts that include Ferrall Coast to Coast, In-Game Live Primetime and Pro Football Today, will benefit from an insight provided by BetMGM's team of experts.</p>
<p>The new multi-year agreement will also see Warren Sharp, the leading pro football analyst for SportsGrid, report from MGM Resorts properties such as MGM National Harbor in Maryland. Those reports will then be distributed over multiple SportsGrid platforms such as the website, video streaming networks, as well as social media channels of the two companies. What's more, SportsGrid's Ferral Coast to Coast podcast will feature odds and promotions from BetMGM.</p>
<p>In a statement released on August 23, 2022, Adam Kaplan, SportsGrid's Chief Operating Officer, said that it is thrilling to expand the collaboration with BetMGM. He acknowledged that the partnership expansion builds upon a collaboration that was initiated earlier this year.</p>
<p>"By further leveraging SportsGrid's media-as-a-service model, BetMGM will benefit from the scale of our network's audience and distribution footprints, the integration of top talent like Warren Sharp and the live content production from premier MGM Resorts properties," explained Kaplan.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Sharp added: "I am excited to provide BetMGM customers and SportsGrid's nationwide audience with my real-time insights and analytics throughout the NFL regular season and playoffs." According to him, the new collaboration will provide him with a "unique perspective in covering the NFL matchups, spread, over/under and money lines, along with futures odds and player props."</p>
<p>Matt Prevost, BetMGM's Chief Revenue Officer, deemed SportsGrid an excellent partner. He outlined that the company is looking forward to offering unique content for sports fans. In conclusion, Prevost acknowledged that the new collaboration comes "just in time for the start of the football season."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, BetMGM announced another important collaboration. The company inked a strategic partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in Canada. The strategic collaboration expanded BetMGM's presence further into the regulated betting market in the country.</p>
<p>Before that, in June, the company inked a partnership with Carnival Corporation, the leading British-American cruise operator. Under the terms of the agreement, BetMGM introduced its mobile and retail sports betting services, as well as iGaming services to cruise ships for the operator.</p>
<p>Although BetMGM continues to expand its presence, the company remains committed to responsible gambling. The company is proud to offer its customers tools and resources that promote responsible play.</p>
