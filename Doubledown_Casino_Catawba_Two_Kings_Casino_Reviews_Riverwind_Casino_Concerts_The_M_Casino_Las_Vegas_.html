    <h1>Doubledown Casino Catawba Two Kings Casino Reviews Riverwind Casino Concerts The M Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Spribe found the inspiration for its next-generation game, Aviator, in the crypto gaming industry, capitalizing on a social and accessible experience that appeals to Millennials. Today, we have a sit-down with Spribe managing partner David Natroshvili who walks us through the intricacies of game design in the age of social gaming.</p>
<p>Q: Spribe has been on the radar for a while now and staying busy judging by the sheer variety of licenses you have accumulated! Can you tell us a little more about yourself and what you do?</p>
<p>Spribe is an iGaming supplier specialized in next-generation “smart” games that are currently disrupting the market. Targeted at Millennials, our games have a fresh approach, innovative mechanics and experience. Our flagship game “Aviator”, the so-called “increasing curve” game, is taking the industry by storm – we are experiencing meteoric growth rate and demand for this particular game.</p>
<p>Q: Why Generation Y? Do you reckon the games we get today in iGaming do not appeal to this specific generation?</p>
<p>We believe Millennials require a different approach and a completely new type of product, as they are grown in a different era, where every app that they have been using is social and mobile-first. It’s hard for them to jump right into traditional games, like slots or roulette, since this experience is totally new for them.</p>
<p>Q: How are your games different than what is already on the market?</p>
<p>Our approach is to provide the same experience to which Millennials are already accustomed and feel comfortable. This means: mobile-first, simple UI, social elements, multiplayer, fast game sessions.</p>
<p>Our flagship game, Aviator is a great example of this: this multiplayer game with a simple user interface and game mechanics where the user is in control provides a unique, completely different experience.</p>
<p>Q: We checked out Aviator and found the game concept a delight. What inspired you to create it?</p>
<p>We were closely watching the crypto casino industry where these type of games first appeared. Despite the new concept, poor execution and niche industry, games were performing surprisingly well. We decided to give these games decent execution: added some features, made them mobile-first and responsive and started to offer them to operators worldwide. I remember our launch at ICE London: the first reaction of everyone was “I don’t think this will work”, but after just a couple of minutes of playing, they quickly realized the power of this game.</p>
<p>Q: Do you reckon that there is more flexibility in iGaming with regards to game design. Is Spribe only getting started?</p>
<p>Our approach in design is: form follows function. This means that we will adapt the design to provide the best experience possible. We believe new generation games are about simplicity and social experiences, this is why our games look so different.</p>
<p>Q: How far will the social online casino experience evolve over the next years?</p>
<p>I believe social elements, multiplayer is the future of iGaming. People are interacting with the products in new ways, they are growing in an environment where social is a part and in many cases the main pillar of the product. The casino industry should adapt to this new standard.</p>
<p>For example in Aviator, we have live chat, where players can talk with each other. What we have created is another layer of entertainment for users, where they become friends and experience things together.</p>
<p>Q: Did 2020 prove difficult for you and what lessons did you draw from the pandemic?</p>
<p>For Spribe 2020 was a year of tremendous growth: more and more operators became interested in our games, we partnered with big names in the industry and obtained major licenses: UKGC and MGA to name a few. The pandemic was challenging in many ways, but as always, when times are tough, more innovation follows.</p>
<p>Q: What’s the roadmap looking for you in 2021?</p>
<p>Our goal is to become an N1 provider of new generation, “Smart” games and with upcoming big partnerships, I believe 2021 will be an exciting year for us.</p>
