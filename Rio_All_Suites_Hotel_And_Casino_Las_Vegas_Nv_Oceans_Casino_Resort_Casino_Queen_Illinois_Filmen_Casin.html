<p>Unibet, a brand by Kindred Group, announced the launch of a new exclusive casino game for players in New Jersey last week.</p>
<p>New Jersey Customers Can Now Access Eagles Live Dealer Black Jack</p>
<p>The new game dubbed Eagles Live Dealer Black Jack was created by Evolution Gaming. Moreover, the new live dealer casino game is the result of an existing partnership between Unibet and the Philadelphia Eagles. Eagles Live Dealer Black Jack complements a continuously growing portfolio available for Unibet customers. Players in New Jersey can enjoy the new title by visiting Unibet’s New Jersey website or via mobile devices running iOS or Android. In fact, players in the state can access more Eagles-branded titles as well.</p>
<p>“Evolution Gaming has created another world-class live dealer game that allows our customers to interact with real casino dealers through an internet video feed.” Manuel Stan, SVP at Kindred US</p>
<p>Manuel Stan, the SVP at Kindred US acknowledged that the new title is another world-class live dealer game created by Evolution Gaming. He explained that the game enables customers to interact with real casino dealers through the internet. According to Stan, customers in New Jersey are interested in high-quality and authentic gaming experiences. He continued that thanks to Unibet’s partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles, customers in the states can now access Evolution’s newest live dealer game. Moreover, the launch of the game came just in time for the Eagles playoff game against Tampa Bay that was played on January 16. In conclusion, Stan said that the company is “happy to provide our customers with another way to support their favorite NFL team.”</p>
<p>Evolution Continues to Grow</p>
<p>The recent launch of the new live dealer game coincided with Evolution’s launch of Live Lightning Roulette for customers in New Jersey. The company released the game back in 2018, but as of last week, it is now available for customers in one of the biggest markets in the US.</p>
<p>Before that, in December, Evolution joined forces with the Austrian Lotteries brand, win2day. Consequently, win2day received access to Evolution’s blackjack tables and roulette.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Evolution announced the launch of its live casino games in Argentina’s Buenos Aires province again in December 2021. The launch was completed in partnership with the operator BetWarrior, which delivered Evolution’s portfolio of live dealer games for customers at www.betwarrior.bet.ar. The recent launch of the new live dealer game in New Jersey only reaffirms that Evolution remains committed to growing globally and entering new jurisdictions.</p>
