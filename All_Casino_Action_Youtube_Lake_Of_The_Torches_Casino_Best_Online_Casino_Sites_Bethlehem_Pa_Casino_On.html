<p>BGaming has developed an image compression algorithm that is set to improve the loading time of the provider’s games and reduce their weight by 55%. The development team at BGaming was able to use this algorithm to compress the graphics of the games while maintaining their quality.</p>
<p>No Manual Adjustments Are Needed, the Algorithm Compresses Images Automatically</p>
<p>The algorithm created by BGaming’s development team is able to automatically compress the images and determine the quality loss, which is minimal to zero. Thanks to this development, the average game file size of the brand’s portfolio went down from 16.4 MB to a little over 7 MB.</p>
<p>Graphic changes are not visible to the naked eye and 70% of BGaming’s titles take up less than 10 MB of storage.</p>
<p>Operators will reap several additional benefits from the algorithm. They will be able to overcome limitations caused by VPNs and Internet issues. In doing so, they will provide players with a more smooth gaming experience. This leads to higher engagement and ultimately, more players to their platforms.</p>
<p>Yury Kuvetski, the front-end lead at BGaming, shared a few words on the algorithm. He said that image automation is easy, but none of the solutions so far were able to maintain the quality of the games.</p>
<p>He added that BGaming came up with the most complicated way and managed to come up with a comprehensive solution and “provide players with the best possible experience.”</p>
<p>The Supplier Recently Expanded in Germany</p>
<p>It is safe to say that BGaming has had a successful period. In June, the supplier announced that it implemented all the technical improvements by the German regulator and is now able to provide its content to the local operators.</p>
<p>The requirements that BGaming had to adhere to were a max limit of €1 ($1.02) per spin, no autoplay and a 5-second maximum spin length. Alexandr Shavel, the head of business development at BGaming, stated that the company was able to “quickly define the needs” of German operators and help them overcome the harsh regulations in the country.</p>
<p>He also added that BGaming aims to strengthen its relationship with German operators and continue supplying them with market-leading content. One of the quality games that these operators will be able to offer is Lucky Lady Moon Megaways, the sequel to the legendary release Lucky Lady Moon.</p>
<p>One month before the provider was greenlit in Germany, BGaming expanded its European presence by partnering with Platincasino. Even though Europe remains the central focus of the provider, BGaming has over 500 partners on a global level at the moment.</p>
