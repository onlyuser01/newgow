    <h1>Casino Shreveport Hotel Captain Jack Casino No Deposit Bonus Riverside Casino Golf Resort Jena Choct</h1>

<p>An offer by NeoGames to purchase Aspire Global couldn’t have been better timed. The gaming company’s BtoBet company is expanding its sports betting reach, adding value to the entire portfolio. BtoBet will now go live in Denmark, the latest country to add the sportsbook.</p>
<p>BtoBet Approved for Denmark</p>
<p>Aspire Global has increased its presence in Denmark through sports betting services. Its BtoBet sportsbook obtained an operating license from the Danish Gambling Authority, the Spillemyndigheden. Aspire can now offer sports betting to Danish players in addition to its casino offerings.</p>
<p>The certification enhances the firm’s position on the European market. Aspire is currently active in the US and UK, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Nigeria, Colombia, Mexico, and most recently, in Poland, where it partnered with BestBet24.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company is focusing on expansion in conjunction with North American growth and building on its success in Africa and Latin America. It has also agreed to support FanDuel brand Flutter Entertainment’s expansion into Brazilian daily fantasy sports (DFS) markets.</p>
<p>More Options for Danish Gamblers</p>
<p>Aspire Global began operations in Denmark in 2012 in the casino sector. With the new license, its BtoBet subsidiary can now expand into sports betting.</p>
<p>Tsachi Mamon, CEO of Aspire, stated that the acquisitions of BtoBet (and its proprietary sportsbook) have significantly enhanced the company’s offerings. BtoBet was acquired in 2020 by Aspire.</p>
<p>He added, “We see significant growth opportunities by offering both existing partners and new customers across the world a leading comprehensive gaming offering covering the technology platform, sportsbook, games, games aggregation, and managed services.”</p>
<p>NeoGames Moving On Aspire</p>
<p>The new addition to BtoBet’s footprint is good news for NeoGames. The iLottery operator recently approached Aspire with a deal to purchase the company. Aspire Global is valued at SEK4.3 billion ($464.5 million) in the public tender offer. This represents a 41% premium on the closing Nordic Nasdaq Exchange trading price of $8.61 per share on January 17.</p>
<p>NeoGames will acquire 50% of Aspires’ shareholding via its per-share offer. Aspire’s remaining equity will be acquired through 7.6 million shares that will be distributed by NeoGames.</p>
<p>The credit advisory of US private equity firm Blackstone will provide NeoGames with $215 million in term loans to finance the cash component of the deal.</p>
<p>Aspire’s board has approved the arrangement. However, it still needs approval from shareholders.</p>
