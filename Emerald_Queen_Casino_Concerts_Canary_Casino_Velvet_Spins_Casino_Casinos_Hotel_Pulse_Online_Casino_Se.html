<p>Serial review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Serial has a horror theme, examining the dark topic of serial killers.</p>
<p>Players will enter a world where a bloodthirsty murderer is running wild. Law enforcement will try to stay ahead of the game, but the evidence is not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>To enjoy this slot, players will need to be in the mood for a little gore.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is infused with rock vibes, and plenty of suspense. The reels spin with a satisfying flicking that gives a tactile feel to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Among the symbols players will see various bloody pieces of evidence including gloves and chains. Each object suggests the depraved nature of the murderer’s crimes.</p>
<p>A hardened detective, terrified victim, and the killer himself also appear on the reels. The most heart-wrenching symbol is a missing poster showing the face of one of the murder victims.</p>
<p>Behind the reels there is a bleak room covered in grime. Players may wonder if this is the tragic setting of one of the serial killer’s crimes.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation create a dramatic world of crime and violence.</p>
<p>Win with 2 xNudge symbols and their high multiplier values</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Serial has a reel structure of 5-7-7-7-5. However, players begin with several positions locked resulting in a reel structure of 3-3-3-3-3.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>If players choose, they can opt to increase their bet by 20% to guarantee that a Scatter will appear on the second reel.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Enhancer Cells can be opened with a respin, then a Wild, xWays, Infectious xWays, or character symbol lands for each respin.</p>
<p>The xWays symbol reveals 2-4 matching symbols, and if more than one appear, they will all reveal matching symbols.</p>
<p>The xNudge Wild symbol is a stacked Wild that will always nudge to become fully visible, with every nudge increasing its multiplier by 1.</p>
<p>During Respins, all winning symbols remain on the reels and the reels spin again, creating the potential for an increased win. Every Respin that adds to the win will prompt another Respin.</p>
<p>The xSplit Wild symbol is a 2x Wild that appears exclusively on the last reel. The xSplit Wild has the special ability to split all symbols in its row into two symbols.</p>
<p>Win with xSplit symbol included</p>
<p>Infectious xWays symbols have the special ability to prompt all regular sized symbols on the reels to expand.</p>
<p>The Search feature is triggered when players land 3 Scatters. The feature begins with a number of free spins defined by the numbers carried by the triggering Scatters. During this feature the Enhancer Cells on reels 2, 3, and 4 open up.</p>
<p>The Kill feature is triggered when 3 Scatters and 1 xSplit symbol land together. The Kill feature shares the qualities of the Search feature, but the xSplit symbol will become a Jumping Wild.</p>
<p>The maximum payout for Serial is 74,800x the player’s total bet.</p>
