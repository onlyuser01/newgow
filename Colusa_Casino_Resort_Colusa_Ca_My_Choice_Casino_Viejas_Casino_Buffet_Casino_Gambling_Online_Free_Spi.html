    <h1>Colusa Casino Resort Colusa Ca My Choice Casino Viejas Casino Buffet Casino Gambling Online Free Spi</h1>

<p>After I won over $12000 I was informed that because I had used a promotion code was only able to withdraw $5000 which was fine I was still happy that I had won the money however after I provided my identification was informed that my bank had issued the Casino a charge back to some of the deposits that I had made and Rather than simply contacting me and informing me of the chargebacks the casino chose to refund the money to my credit card and because of this prevented prevented me from being able to do anything about it the casino has told me that I need to contact my bank and have them refund the money however that is not an option because my bank has informed me that since they sent the money back that there is nothing that they can do they said that I could read deposit them on using the card now that the bank is aware That this company is legit they were the ones that issued the charge backs without my authorization or Consent without my knowledge because the casino came up and was flagged as fraud this is completely outside of my control when when I informed the casino of this they said that they are going to escalate this to their financial team however their financial team cannot be reached by anyone and you cannot talk to them live you cannot chat with them or any kind of communication I keep getting told every day that they are going to contact me via email and every day they tell me either another day 48 hours or at the end of the weekend and I have grown completely out of patience with this situation the simple resolution would be to have me redeposit the money using a different card or the same card now that my bank is aware of my business with them but have been told that this is not something I can not something I can do I also also have Thousands of dollars in my account waiting to be withdrawn withdrawn which easily could pay for the less than $200 worth of charge backs that The casino is using to essentially essentially steal my money and not give me access to it I am so worried that I have just been scammed by a crook and a illegitimate casillegitimate casino claiming to be legitimate I have done everything that I can on my end I have contacted my bank they have told me that what the casino wants is impossible that there is no possible way that they can refund the money they have told me multiple times to simply Have them charge me again as the money is in my account and very easily accessible above they have my phone number they have my account number all they have to do is make the charges again or I can give them a new payment I have multiple banks that I can use to make the deposits or they can take it out of the money of mine that they have but they are doing none of these things they are just giving me the run around and continuing to feed me story after story about why they can't pay me the money that I am owed I would ask that this casino actually do what they have advertised to do and pay me the money that they owe me take the money out of my account that I owe for the charge backs that they made the mistake of sending to my bank without contacting me 1st Or Allowing me to make the deposits again from a different card or the same card Whatever it is they need me to do I'm happy to do I just want to get paid like everyone else and not ripped off</p>
