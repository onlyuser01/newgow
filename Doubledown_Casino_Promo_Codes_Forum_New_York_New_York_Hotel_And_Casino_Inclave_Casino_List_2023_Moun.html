<p>Macau’s gambling companies have vowed between $2.5 and $3.8 million for the sum total of $25 million to help with medical supplies and the relief efforts in the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Coronavirus Threat Continues to Spread Prompting Casinos to Donate</p>
<p>With the Macau gaming industry taking a hit last week when the administrative region’s government imposed a two-week ban on all casino facilities, part of a broader lock-down, local operators are stepping up their efforts to help tackle the deadly coronavirus that has already claimed over 1,000 lives and infected a number exceeding 42,500 people.</p>
<p>In a bid to help fight the virus, six casino operators and junket companies have vowed a collective $25 million to help researchers expedite finding a cure for the disease, news outlets in the region reported.</p>
<p>Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. Has donated an estimated $2.5 million to help fight the virus through its charity arm, the Galaxy Entertainment Group Foundation. Meanwhile, Lawrence Ho’s company, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, contributed $2.6 million towards the efforts to contain the spreading of the virus.</p>
<p>The company said that the money was allocated to purchase the necessary medical supplies and provide the community with better protection.</p>
<p>MGM China Holdings has contributed another $2.5 million joined by Las Vegas Sands which met the amount. Money was forwarded with different pretexts – some companies were focusing on research whereas others wanted to help the government implement all measures without supporting extra costs.</p>
<p>Wynn Macau and SJM Holdings both threw in around $2.5 million. Local junket manufacturers have been slightly more generous with Suncity Group contributing $3.8 million. It also contributed 100,000 face masks, which has been running in thin supply since the coronavirus’ spread has been inexorable despite the measures by the mainland to contaminate the threat.</p>
<p>Containing the Crisis</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has made his first public appearance in Wuhan amid sacking the local governor for the inability to deal with the crisis. Meanwhile, a cruise ship continues to be stuck off the Japanese shores with the number of infections on board going up.</p>
<p>Macau already has 10 reported cases of the coronavirus and these numbers may only increase, despite the administrative region being on a lockdown with only a skeletal public service network operational.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the estimated losses to the casino industry – one of the main staples of the local economy – amount to $100 million a day. Macau has already been buffeted by a modest 2019 with results falling nearly 4%.</p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak is even more threatening to the economy and gambling, but far more importantly, authorities are actively trying to limit its spread.</p>
