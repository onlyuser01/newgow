    <h1>Gold Country Casino Oroville Diamond Casino Hotels Near Pala Casino Hollywood Casino Dayton Ohio Har</h1>

<p>The upcoming peer-to-peer betting platform Prophet Exchange is yet to launch in New Jersey, but the company has announced several key appointments to its internal team. The additions of Matt Stolarz, Zhifeng Shi, and Casey Halpern will help the company achieve its immediate operational goals and ensure that its launch goes well.</p>
<p>Trio of Hires to Bolster the Company’s Before Launch</p>
<p>The company has a lot riding on the Garden State roll-out as it bills itself as the first peer-to-peer betting operation. It’s also in a good position, thanks to a market access deal with Caesars Entertainment signed back in 2021, and it should be launching at some point in the summer.</p>
<p>Stolarz will serve as the company’s director of technical products. He has experience working as a software engineer, specifically for the sports gambling industry. Before working at Prophet Exchange, he was a part of Caesars Entertainment’s team. He also served as a senior software engineer at William Hill before the company’s US assets were bought out by Caesars. Commenting on this opportunity he said:</p>
<p>“I am beyond excited to join Prophet Exchange to help guide and build the first and best sports betting exchange product in the United States. I am also looking forward to working alongside a brilliant and talented team of fellow sports betting industry experts. You couldn’t dream up a better product or a better team to come into.”</p>
<p>Shi will be director of software engineering. He specializes in business insights in near real-time for important businesses, including the New York Stock Exchange. Shi previously worked on a project that created a transaction management platform that handles 6% of the US real estate transactions – a milestone it achieved within a year of launch.</p>
<p>Media Marketing Part of Future Success for Company</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity to work with Prophet Exchange, Shi confirmed that he is looking forward to the challenges that the company may face in developing and deploying its one of the most ambitious products in sports betting in the US to date.</p>
<p>Halpern is joining as head of social media &amp; content. He is coming from the Action Network, a clear leader in marketing sports content to fans, where he was in charge of the social media channels. Halpern has cultivated many positive relationships with athletes and media personalities, making him an important talent acquisition for the company as it prepares to launch and seeks to rapidly achieve recognition.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to join Prophet Exchange. This is an incredible opportunity to help scale an important and innovative product that will be the first of its kind in the US,” Halpern added.</p>
