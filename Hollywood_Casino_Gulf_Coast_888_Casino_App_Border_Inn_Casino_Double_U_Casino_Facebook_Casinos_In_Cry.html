<p>VBET will continue to be an official sponsor of AS Monaco in France. The Ligue1 team and the sports betting operator have extended their existing partnership for a period of three years. VBET has used the opportunity to confirm that it will look to further grow its presence in the French betting market.</p>
<p>VBET Reinforces Presence in French Soccer</p>
<p>The company similarly noted that AS Monaco and VBET share common goals and is hoping to achieve better visibility through this collaboration. VBET France CEO David Ozararat welcomed the chance to strengthen this collaboration and commented on the occasion:</p>
<p>“We are very happy with this renewed confidence from AS Monaco and have strong ambitions for the future, as does this team which continues to surprise again this season.” VBET France CEO David Ozararat</p>
<p>He reminded that the partnership between the two groups has been ongoing since 2020 and their shared path so far has paid off. VBET made an entry into the French gambling market back in 2019. Since then, the company has been growing its footprint and clout in the local gaming market.</p>
<p>More “Quality Partnerships” Needed</p>
<p>Even today, VBET is prepared to expand its presence in the country through other “quality partnerships,” the chief executive noted. Oleg Petrov, CEO of AS Monaco, welcomed the opportunity to be continuing building on this partnership with the sports betting brand.</p>
<p>Petrov expressed hopes that the partnership may last longer and enable the two companies to achieve mutually-beneficial targets. There are good dynamics already, the executive ensured, which made it easier for the two companies to continue with their joint work.</p>
<p>“It was natural to continue this collaboration,” Petrov explained, citing a strong spirit for innovation found in both companies.</p>
