<p>Flows has inked an agreement with the Italian provider Octavian Lab, the former company will leverage its no-code platform to help the supplier supercharge its clients’ businesses</p>
<p>Octavian Lab, an Italian gaming and betting platform provider, has inked a new agreement with Flows, an innovation platform that ingests data from any source or integration. The agreement will see Flows leverage its automation tech to help Octavian Lab’s customers build features and applications without code.</p>
<p>Octavian Lab Pens Deal with Flows</p>
<p>Flows’ novel solutions will help Octavian Lab bolster its products by allowing its clients to easily build features and applications. This, in turn, will allow them to roll out more innovative content, all thanks to Flows’ automation technology.</p>
<p>In short, the agreement will help Octavian Lab’s partners supercharge their respective businesses by allowing them to quickly build various features and applications. As Flows’ solutions require no coding, this will accelerate development and integration for the Italian supplier’s partners.</p>
<p>Flows was designed to be the “most agnostic piece of software” on the market. This description fits the solution’s incredible compatibility, which allows it to be paired with any other piece of technology.</p>
<p>Flows’ ambition is to leverage its plug-in no-code platform to allow businesses to innovate as much as they’d like without constraints. Thanks to the effectiveness of its solutions, the company has partners across the entire gaming industry.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Have Similar Philosophies, CEO Nocentelli Says</p>
<p>Flows’ director of sales, Domenico Mazzola, spoke about the agreement. He said that his team is honored to be trusted by a young and dynamic supplier such as Octavian Lab. Mazzola also praised the supplier for recognizing the importance of innovation and wanting to bring the benefits of Flows to its customers.</p>
<p>We are excited to have partnered with Octavian Lab and are looking forward to welcoming their customers to Flows and to see how they will utilize our no-code technology to supercharge their customers’ experience and their business Domenico Mazzola, director of sales, Flows</p>
<p>Emanuele Nocentelli, Octavian Lab’s chief executive officer, also spoke about the deal. He said that his team is thrilled to close 2022 with such an agreement and is happy to join forces with Flows. Nocentelli noted that Octavian Lab and Flows share the same vision when it comes to gaming and concluded that his team is eager to work alongside Flows.</p>
<p>We are eager to take advantage of the benefits of Flows’ unique software. Emanuele Nocentelli, CEO, Octavian Lab</p>
<p>Octavian Lab is a provider that supplies operators and Italy and beyond with fully managed casino and sports betting solutions. It is one of the latest companies in the sector to recognize the benefits of using Flows’ no-code platform. In early December, NuxGame, another famous gaming content provider, inked a similar agreement with Flows.</p>
