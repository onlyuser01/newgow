    <h1>Parkwest Casino 580 Ute Mountain Casino Zia Casino Asia Lotus Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotels Okada M</h1>

<p>Okada Manila casino resort issued advisory notes to warn customers of unauthorized third parties sales, the Asian-Pacific media GGRAsia reports. The gaming complex located on the Entertainment City strip in Parañaque, Metro Manila, in the Philippines said that, besides trying to sell rooms at the resort, unauthorized parties attempted to sell fake Okada Manila-branded scents.</p>
<p>Unauthorized Hotel Room Reservations Will Not Be Honored</p>
<p>Okada Manila stated that certain social media channels and online platforms were used by persons to sell, resell or offer hotel room packages at the casino resort without being given the authority to do so by the hospitality operator. The casino complex operated by a unit of Japanese company Universal Entertainment Corp, warned customers that purchases of room reservations through unauthorized channels will not be honored at the property.</p>
<p>“We advise the public that they can reserve rooms through the Okada Manila reservation system or reputable booking platforms.” Okada Manila advisory note</p>
<p>The casino resort was given an approval from the Philippine Department of Tourism in October to resume hotel services at the complex in full capacity, Universal Entertainment, the parent for Okada Manila, noted with the release of its financial results for the first 9 months of the year.</p>
<p>The casino resort segment of the company posted a 58.6% drop in net sales, JPY20.56 billion ($198 million), from January through September, resulting in an operating loss of JPY7.62 billion, compared to an operating loss of JPY1.84 billion for the first 9 months of the prior year.</p>
<p>The drop in net sales for the segment was mainly due to the temporary suspension of Okada Manila’s casino mid-March, to implement measures to curb the further spread of the coronavirus infection. In September, Universal Entertainment informed in a filing to Jasdaq that the casino resort in the Philippines had partially removed restrictions to allow it to operate at 30% capacity.</p>
<p>Okada Manila Scents Made Exclusively for the Venue</p>
<p>The second advisory note released by Okada Manila casino resort concerned fake or counterfeit scents or perfumes carrying the hotel’s brand name, stating that:</p>
<p>“The hotel scent we use is made exclusively for Okada Manila and is not sold to the general public. We urge the public not to buy or patronize such fake products.” Okada Manila advisory note</p>
<p>The casino further noted that any unauthorized use of its brands and trademarks for commerce constitutes an infringement of trademark law, and the gaming operator will not hesitate to undertake legal action against all perpetrators.</p>
