<p>Bovada is an acclaimed bookmaker with a global footprint. Today, we will take a look at the sports bookie and, specifically, review Bovada’s Esports portfolio. As one of the most trusted and respected sportsbooks, Bovada has a lot to offer when we talk esports. The website offers a great selection of esports markets, and more importantly, odds that are posted early ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>If there is an esports even you want to bet on, there is a good chance it’s already part of the sportsbook’s offer. From Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) to League of Legends to Overwatch, you have every major game to bet on. You will find even a special section dedicated to the NBA 2K. We cover this and more in our dedicated Bovada Esports review.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports Welcome Bonus &amp; Promotions</p>
<p>Bovada Esports welcome bonus is one of the best most esports bettors will find. While the match rate is only 50% the amount you can claim is up to $250, allowing you to benefit from a good amount of additional funds. Sports bettors would need to rollover the initial deposit and bonus amount 5x before any of the winnings can be released, however.</p>
<p>The bonus will take up to 30 minutes to show in your account balance. The only drawback here is that if you try to cash out your bonus funds prior to meeting the wagering conditions, that would automatically void your deposit and bonus funds.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports RAF Makes Sense</p>
<p>Perhaps no other betting activity is as sociable as betting on esports. Word of mouth gets a long way into the esports community and therefore, an RAF bonus makes a perfect sense. Both bettors will be benefited as the RAF bonus offers a 200% match up to $100 for the person referring based on the friend’s first deposit.</p>
<p>Esports Betting Markets: Overview</p>
<p>Bovada makes it easy to find all events currently available. In our Bovada Esports review we found a multitude of viable markets, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Overwatch</p>
<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</p>
<p>Rainbow Six</p>
<p>Starcraft</p>
<p>League of Legends</p>
<p>Dota 2 &amp; more</p>
<p>Some events may be locked to the time window, and if a market is not currently available, this could simply mean that the event is not currently running. You could place futures at Bovada Esports, which will broaden your betting horizons a little.</p>
<p>League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike often tend to be the largest markets with close to 100 events running on occasion. Part of this is thanks to these games’ great global reach, which has allowed many players to compete regionally and create a lot of demand for betting.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports has been good in capturing the span of the games, including in places such as North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports Bets</p>
<p>Similar to many sportsbooks, Bovada Esports allows bettors to choose from a variety of bet types, including Spread, Win, and Totals, but also Correct Score, Round 1 Winner, Game Special, and others.</p>
<p>Depending on the game you bet on, there will be a number of proposition bets, based entirely on the game you want to bet on. In conducting our Bovada Esports review we found out that each game will understandably have slightly different prop bets.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports Live Streaming</p>
<p>A huge boon to choosing Bovada Esports is the built-in streams for some of the games. Bovada doesn’t necessarily offer streams from every event, but there are many esports games you can watch live, which is an upside.</p>
<p>These streams are usually delayed by two or three minutes to ensure the fairness of the contest, but you can still watch the game you are interested in as the feed is usually the official Twitch stream incorporated into the Bovada Esports design.</p>
<p>In-Play and Live Markets at Bovada Esports</p>
<p>In-play esports betting is an in-demand betting market and as esports bettors get better at finding their way around a sportsbook, they require bigger challenges. Live betting is just what they need.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports offers in-play markets on many of the ongoing competitions. If you go to the Live section, then all you need to do is type in Esports and that will pull you right down to all available live betting events.</p>
<p>When we checked, we could bet on Overwatch League, the LCS, BTS Pro Series, and CS Summit NA.</p>
<p>Get in on the NBA2K Action</p>
<p>Bovada Esports covers a variety of competitions that are slightly outside mainstream esports. Many sports simulators excite a lot of attention, and not least the NBA 2K games, the alter-ego of the NBA which Commissioner Adam Smith called a “part of the family.”</p>
<p>You can expect to find competitive lines on both EA’s FIFA and NBA 2K games as they become available and especially around the time of the games’ crowning competitions.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports Banking</p>
<p>Bovada Esports offers a number of banking methods you can use to deposit and withdraw safely from your account. Some of these payment options will offer quicker cashouts, which is usually a priority for esports bettors.</p>
<p>Today, you may deposit at Bovada Esports using bank and credit cards, and a variety of cryptocurrencies, not least BitcoinCash and Bitcoin. Other payment options include:</p>
<p>QB-Direct</p>
<p>Money Gram</p>
<p>Wire Transfer</p>
<p>Cashier Check</p>
<p>Money Order</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency</p>
<p>Ria</p>
<p>Bovada Esports puts a big emphasis on Bitcoin, which is one of the handiest payment options offering quick deposits and withdrawals, anonymity, and a great way to use your funds. An estimated 87% of all Bovada consumers use Bitcoin as their preferred payment solution. There are some specific deposit limits to observe, though, and they are as follows:</p>
<p>Method Minimum Deposit Maximum Deposit Bitcoin $10 $5,000 Bitcoin Cash $10 $5,000 Visa $20 $1,500 MasterCard $20 $1,500 American Express $20 $1,500 Secure Voucher $10 $300</p>
<p>For withdrawals, cryptocurrencies tend to be the quickest. Most other payment methods will usually take at least several business days to arrive. Meanwhile, withdrawal limits are fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>Method Minimum Withdrawal Maximum Withdrawal Bitcoin $10 $9,500 Bitcoin Cash $10 $9,500 Courier Check $100 $3,000</p>
<p>Withdrawals may vary a little from one account to the next. The best way to know what the exact payment options are is to always check the Cashier when you log in. There may be some small differences between user accounts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all information about banking will be displayed on the website, allowing you to make an informed decision. The only thing we really didn’t like was the pop-up message that asked us if we really wanted to leave as we hadn’t made a deposit just yet. We found that to be a little pushy.</p>
<p>Bet on Esports from your Smartphone</p>
<p>Mobile betting is an option at Bovada Esports. You may use any Android or iOS device to place a bet on an esports contest. Bettors are welcome to use both smartphones and tablets to place the wagers they are interested in.</p>
<p>The betting slip will work well and you will have access to the full range of features. You can still play bets on Live esports contests, watch streams from your favorite competitions, and manage your account funds.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports doesn’t offer a dedicated betting app, but this doesn’t detract from the experience. You can still create a desktop shortcut to enable mobile browsing all the same.</p>
<p>Bovada Customer Support</p>
<p>Bovada has a comprehensive customer support service that allows the website to offer quick solutions to bettors around the clock. There are several ways to get in touch, including a phone number and email. Alternatively, you can reach out on their Facebook or Twitter pages.</p>
<p>Customer support number: 1-888-263-0000</p>
<p>Email address: [email protected]</p>
<p>Response time usually takes around 12 hours, but it may stretch up to 24 hours for email at least. If you call the phone line directly, you will be answered as soon as an operator is available.</p>
<p>There is a very good part of the website known as the Help section, which will allow you to troubleshoot quite a few issues on your own.</p>
<p>Is Bovada Esports Safe?</p>
<p>Esports fans do value safety and security and this should be no different when it comes to esports betting. To put it briefly, Bovada is a trusted and respected betting authority. While you won’t find many discussions on Reddit and HLTV with specificity to Bovada’s esports section.</p>
<p>Yet, Bovada offers a fully encrypted SSL connection and they have been operating and running various online betting and gambling verticals since 1994. The bookmaker is registered in Panama, giving it some credibility and accountability.</p>
<p>Judging from the sports betting sections, the only real issue with Bovada has been delays in withdrawals for any non-cryptocurrency payment methods. On the plus side, all payouts have been honored.</p>
<p>Bovada Esports Review: Conclusion</p>
<p>Bovada Esports has done in building the infrastructure necessary to offer enough competitive betting markets. Navigation is easy and to the point, and you can pick from a variety of great banking methods. Esports fans will find the website to be a bit sports-focused at first, but the esports betting markets are clearly displayed for you to enjoy.</p>
