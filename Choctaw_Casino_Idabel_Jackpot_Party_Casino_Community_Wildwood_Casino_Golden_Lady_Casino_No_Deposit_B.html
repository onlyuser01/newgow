<p>All the positive factors mean that Entain can look to the future with confidence, CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen said</p>
<p>Global gambling giant Entain posted its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022. The company highlighted its successes, noting that 2022 was a very strong year for the company.</p>
<p>Entain reported that gaming revenue for the period increased by 12% year-on-year to around $5.17 billion (converted to USD). Online net gaming revenue experienced a slight decline of 1%, although the company is pretty optimistic about the state of the vertical. Retail NGR, meanwhile, skyrocketed by 66% thanks to the COVID-19 restrictions being lifted.</p>
<p>The gambling juggernaut also reported a group underlying EBITDA of $1,1 billion, representing a 13% year-on-year increase. Reflecting the net revenue trends, online underlying EBITDA declined by 8% while retail underlying EBITDA improved by a whopping 319%.</p>
<p>Group profit after tax plummeted by 88% to $39.25 million.</p>
<p>The company also announced a second interim dividend of $59.5 million (around $0.10 per share). This brings the total dividend for 2022 to $0.20 per share.</p>
<p>Other Notable Highlights</p>
<p>Entain also provided insights into BetMGM’s performance. The gambling brand’s revenue of $1.44 billion exceeded expectations and the company is now set to become EBITDA positive in H2 2023.</p>
<p>Entain added that 2022 saw it continue its growth strategy and diversification efforts. In addition, the company continues to be a leader in responsibility and sustainability, claiming to be the only global operator with 100% revenue from regulated or regulating markets.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company rolled out its ARC player protection program across 22 markets and was awarded GamCare’s Advanced Safer Gambling Standard and SBC’s Global Socially Responsible Operator of the Year.</p>
<p>CEO Nygaard-Andersen Praised the Progress</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, the company’s chief operating officer, commented on Entain’s 2022 performance, praising the excellent results. She noted that her team’s ongoing efforts continue to cement Entain as a global leader in betting, gaming and interactive entertainment. Nygaard-Andersen is also very happy that all of the company’s revenues come from regulated or regulating markets, which attests to the success of Entain’s sustainable growth strategy.</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that the company’s diversified business now has a presence in 40 territories, demonstrating the company’s competitive advantage. Entain remains committed to delivering safe gaming experiences to customers all over the world.</p>
<p>These factors, combined with the strong underlying momentum across our business, mean that we continue to look to the future with confidence. Jette Nygaard-Andersen, COO, Entain</p>
<p>Entain remains bullish on expanding its business in a safe and responsible manner. A few weeks ago, the company received a license in Nevada, with some of its executives becoming members of BetMGM’s governing board.</p>
