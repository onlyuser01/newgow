<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci Says Sports Could Resume, Bettors Say He Retains Job Through April</p>

<p>The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) says stringent safeguards to contain the coronavirus should be implemented for sports to resume play.</p>
<p>Fauci says no fans should be permitted inside stadiums. Players should also be regularly tested to assure they’re in good health, and those who aren’t be quarantined.</p>
<p>“Nobody comes to the stadium. Put [players] in big hotels, wherever you want to play, keep them very well surveilled,” Fauci explained to Snapchat’s Peter Hamby. “Have them tested every single week and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.”</p>
<p>Sports in the US – and nearly everywhere else in the world – have been put on hold. As a result, sportsbooks in the 17 states where sports betting is up and running have little to offer bettors.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced he would be talking this week with leaders of American professional sports, including the commissioners of the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and PGA Tour.</p>
<p>“We want to get our sports back, so important,” Trump stated. “I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old. But I haven’t actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.”</p>
<p>Fauci didn’t specify a timetable as to when he thinks sports – if they follow the stated conditions – could resume play.</p>
<p>Fauci Odds</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the NIAID director since 1984, and has advised every president since Ronald Reagan on health issues. His distinguished career is highlighted by his vast contributions to HIV/AIDS research.</p>
<p>But when it comes to working under the Trump administration, no job is completely safe. The media has tried to expose a contentious relationship between the two, a notion both deny.</p>
<p>However, Fauci said this week that the almost-daily White House press briefings are “really draining.”</p>
<p>It isn’t the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public. It’s the amount of time,” the doctor explained.</p>
<p>PredictIt has a political betting market asking whether Trump will relieve Fauci of his duties. But bettors aren’t sold on the President acting on such a termination.</p>
<p>“Will Anthony Fauci be director of the NIAID on May 1?” has “Yes” shares at 88 cents.</p>
<p>Trump Handling of Pandemic</p>
<p>The Real Clear Politics polling average of Trump’s handing of the coronavirus crisis gives the President a 46.9 percent approval rating, with 50.9 percent disapproving. That’s down considerably from March 30 when he had a 50.5 percent approval.</p>
<p>As for the November election, Trump remains the PredictIt favorite at 50 cents. Presumed Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden is next at 45 cents.</p>
<p>UK oddsmakers have Trump at 10/11 (implied odds 52.38 percent), and Biden 11/10 (47.62 percent).</p>
