<p>The recent launch complements the ongoing expansion of WynnBET and brings exciting online gaming and sports betting experiences for customers in West Virginia</p>
<p>The global gaming and hospitality leader, Wynn Resorts, announced that its leading online casino and sports betting application, WynnBET, continues its expansion into the United States. On Thursday, the company confirmed that WynnBET has gone live with sports betting and online casino in West Virginia, delivering unique experiences for eligible customers in the state.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new launch, West Virginia customers can access the WynnBET app via Google Play and the Android store. Additionally, users can also register their accounts on www.wynnbet.com. The latest launch brings WynnBET’s wide range of online casino games for customers in West Virginia. As a result, online players will be able to access leading slots, live dealer roulette and blackjack games, as well as other engaging content, including Keno, video poker and classic casino games.</p>
<p>Similar to other jurisdictions where WynnBET has gone live, new customers can benefit from a unique sign-up incentive. Customers in West Virginia that register for the first time can receive a deposit match of up to $1,000. Additionally, sports fans can also tap into a unique and engaging offer valid for new users.</p>
<p>Besides the incentives for new customers, all WynnBET online users in West Virginia will be able to benefit from Wynn Rewards, the company’s industry-leading rewards program. The loyalty program grants customers a chance to secure unique experiences at different Wynn Resorts’ venues and also tap into other benefits. According to Wynn, “Existing Wynn Rewards members will be able to connect their accounts to WynnBET upon completing registration.”</p>
<p>WynnBET Continues to Grow and Expand to New States</p>
<p>Ian Williams, Wynn Sports Interactive’s president, shared his excitement about the recent expansion of WynnBET. He thanked the West Virginia Lottery Commission for collaborating with the company during the licensing process. Finally, Williams pointed out: “We are thrilled to bring our first-class online casino and sportsbook to players in West Virginia, marking our second state launch this year and the third iCasino market to our growing portfolio.”</p>
<p>“We would like to thank the West Virginia Lottery Commission for working with us throughout our licensure process in the state,“ Ian Williams, president of Wynn Sports Interactive</p>

<p>Continuing its US-facing expansion, the entry in West Virginia marks the 11th state where WynnBET offers its sports betting services. Additionally, the recent launch complemented the growth of the company’s presence within the online gambling market. Previously, WynnBET has entered strategic US jurisdictions such as New Jersey and Michigan.</p>
