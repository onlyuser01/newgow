<p>PokerStars to introduce Rapid Transfer as payment method in Europe</p>
<p>Customers can bank directly from the website without visiting their online banking</p>
<p>PokerStars continuous to be synonymous to innovation and state-of-the-art online poker</p>
<p>PokerStars’ latest addition to bolstering its payment system is Rapid Transfer. Customers can carry out transactions without leaving the merchant’s website.</p>
<p>PokerStars Bring another Processor On Board: Rapid Transfer</p>
<p>Innovative company PokerStars, the popular card room subsidiary of gaming and betting company The Stars Group, has said that it would further boost payment security in Europe by introducing Rapid Transfer, a payment transfer solution developed by Paysafe Group.</p>
<p>The roll-out will happen across ten countries in Europe that currently have PokerStars’ domain running. Users will now be able to use Rapid Transfers and use online banking to conduct deposits on the platform.</p>
<p>PokerStars has pointed out to the improved security of the solution as well as the inherent convenience as these transfers happen instantly and can be done directly from the company’s website without leaving the banking menu.</p>
<p>While no official list of all countries enjoying Rapid Transfer solutions has been published, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal will probably be on it. Another possible market is the Czech Republic in which PokerStars returned last year.</p>
<p>PokerStars already allows customers to transact money using a number of secure e-wallets and payment solutions, including NETELLER, Skrill, and Paysafe.</p>
<p>The brand’s commitment to upholding a safe gaming environment has been stressed by NETELLER CEO Lorenzo Pellegrino:</p>
<p>“PokerStars’ position as a market leader is reflected across everything they do. We are delighted to be supporting them to ensure this quality service for players spans across the deposit methods they offer, via Rapid Transfer in addition to Skrill, NETELLER and Paysafe card.”</p>
<p>PokerStars: Home of Online Poker</p>
<p>PokerStars commands the respect of the global poker community. The company hosts some of the most prominent poker events in the sector, including the World Championship of Online Poker, the Spring Championship of Online Poker, and others.</p>
<p>In addition, the card room recently dealt its 200th billion hand setting it apart from many other brands which have joined the global poker pursuit in the past few years. To continue providing a great service, PokerStars has been adding new poker versions as well as multiple back-up payment options, allowing users to choose their own way of transferring and handling funds.</p>
<p>PokerStars recently introduced a re-launched game engine which has been introducing numerous changes to the interface, mechanics and dynamics of gaming at the portal.</p>
