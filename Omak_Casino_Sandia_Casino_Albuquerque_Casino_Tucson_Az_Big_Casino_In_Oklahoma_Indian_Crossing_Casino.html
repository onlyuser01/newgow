<p>Kalamba Games is launching its products on new platforms and markets thanks to its integration partnership with Gaming Innovation Group (GiG). Through this tie-up, the supplier of player-favorite game titles will be able to reach new customers and audiences.</p>
<p>Boosting Kalamba’s Game Reach and Clout</p>
<p>GiG is integrating more than 50 Kalamba Games slot products along with the dedicated promotional and marketing tools, and the BullsEye RGS platform. This will give GiG partners the opportunity to tap into the full potential of Kalamba Games and not just deliver on a unique selection of highly-acclaimed titles, but also have access to the tools that make them such.</p>
<p>Kalamba’s titles include proven player-favorites as Holmes: Reel Detective, Blazing Bull 2, Ducks Till Dawn, and Caribbean Anne 2. The partnership enables Kalamba to continue growing its footprint, brand, and presence while securing important partnerships that can help with the further distribution of up-and-coming games down the road.</p>
<p>Kalamba is already certified across numerous jurisdictions across Europe which makes it particularly flexible when operating in markets covered by Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, Italian, or Maltese gaming licenses. Many operators in those markets are opting for the Kalamba portfolio of titles.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby said that he was appreciative of the partnership with GiG and that it would enable the company to spread its content message even further. “We are delighted with the potential the partnership offers us,” Crosby concluded.</p>
<p>Welcomed Opportunity for All Parties Involved</p>
<p>GiG director of sales and business development Martin Collins said that Kalamba has an established reputation in the industry and its products are well-received by industry players. Kalamba is further capable of delivering the type of content that will improve GiG’s own standing. He further explained:</p>
<p>“It helps us, as a company, to drive new business growth and so of course we’re looking forward to seeing its impact.” GiG director of sales and business development Martin Collins</p>
<p>Kalamba Games has made several important strides in the iGaming industry of late. The company signed a content partnership with 888casino. The company also signed an important partnership with Big Time Gaming, gaining access to the branded Megaways mechanic that will enable the company to pursue fresh gameplay opportunities.</p>
