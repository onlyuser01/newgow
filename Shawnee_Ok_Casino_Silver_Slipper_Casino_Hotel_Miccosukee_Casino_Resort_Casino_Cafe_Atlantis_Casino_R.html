    <h1>Shawnee Ok Casino Silver Slipper Casino Hotel Miccosukee Casino Resort Casino Cafe Atlantis Casino R</h1>

<p>Sports betting and iGaming brand and operator kwiff has expanded its presence in the online casino gaming market by signing a partnership with Pragmatic Play, a supplier and provider of iGaming content for some of the biggest names in the industry. As a result, kwiff players will have access to a number of established slot and live casino games.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Goes Live with Kwiff</p>
<p>These include more than 200 slots, which feature some all-time player favorites such as Gates of Olympus, Wolf Gold, The Dog House, Big Bass Bonanza, Chili Heat, and others. The company has also spent a lot of time streamlining its live casino portfolio, bringing players excellent game shows such as Boom City, Mega Wheel, Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, Mega Sic Bo, and Mega Roulette. Kwiff CEO Charles Lee welcomed the opportunity for the company to go live with Pragmatic products and said:</p>
<p>Our goal is ensuring our players enjoy the very best entertainment and we’re very pleased to welcome Pragmatic Play to our premium list of content partners. We’re particularly looking forward to launching the biggest network promotion in the history of iGaming “Drops &amp; Wins” where there are 1M in prizes up for grabs every month. Kwiff CEO Charles Lee</p>
<p>Kwiff has also factored in the fact that Pragmatic Play has developed a unique promotional tool and feature, “Drops &amp; Wins,” which enables the brand to connect with audiences by giving them the best possible ways to increase their profits and have a chance at striking out big awards. Both the company’s slots and live casino products have a chance of rewarding players.</p>
<p>The Weekly Tournament hosted by each partner operator and Pragmatic Play allows players to compete and have a chance of winning big. The live casino content is further complemented by additional worthwhile titles, which include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and exotic options such as Andar Bahar and Dragon Tiger.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Is Making Big Strides in iGaming</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides was similarly pleased with the opportunity. She explained that kwiff is providing players with an excellent iGaming experience and that Pragmatic Play’s addition will only help contribute to the brand growth and the opportunities that its audiences can experience.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s an opportunity for Pragmatic Play to also showcase its iGaming titles to new audiences. Pragmatic Play recently made several big business moves with the company launching a new live studio in Bulgaria, and announcing plans to hire more than 2,000 people in the country by the end of 2023. Another partnership was struck with Aposta.la in Paraguay just this week.</p>
