<p>888 Holdings, a big company behind several casino and sports betting sites, has demonstrated its commitment to responsible gambling. The company has launched its safer gambling product available to all bettors in Italy.</p>
<p>The Control Center Goes Live in Italy</p>
<p>888 is a global brand that operates in multiple markets. In its latest move, the company has decided to boost its Italian business with The Control Centre – its proprietary safer gambling solution. Since Italy is one of 888’s most important markets, the company wants to support its clients by helping them control their playtime.</p>
<p>By using The Control Centre, players can gain a deep insight into their gambling behavior. Moreover, the product provides real-time data of players’ playtime on their gaming accounts, allowing them to see their patterns.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who conclude that they spend too much or play too compulsively can regulate their gambling. By using The Control Centre, players can set deposit limits, restrict their playtime or exclude themselves for a time.</p>
<p>The Product Is Proven to Work</p>
<p>888 first introduced The Control Centre to its customers in the United Kingdom. Ever since its launch in 2020, the solution has been gaining popularity. In 2021 alone, the product’s customer base skyrocketed by 23%.</p>
<p>According to 888’s official statistics, players who use The Control Centre tend to be much more responsible and moderate. Data shows that those customers are 20% more likely to set deposit limits and a whopping 102% more likely to exclude themselves for a while.</p>
<p>888’s goal is to make safe gambling trendy and teach its customers to play in moderation. The company believes that this is the key to sustainability. To that end, its ESG framework continues to promote responsible gambling to 888’s clients.</p>
<p>888 Remains Committed to Safe Gambling</p>
<p>Andre Antony, the vice president of customer safety and due diligence for 888, spoke about the launch in Italy. He shared that he is excited to roll out The Control Centre in more of 888’s core markets.</p>
<p>Antony added that his company is well-aware of how important it is to protect its customers and teach them to play safely. The Control Centre provides them with transparent information that lets them monitor their activity and be in control of their personal gambling habits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 888 continues to conquer new markets. The gambling brand just launched its critically-acclaimed Sports Illustrated Sportsbook in the US state of Virginia. A few days ago one of 888’s subsidiaries, 888casino, inked a partnership deal with Kalamba Games, a leading developer of slots titles.</p>
