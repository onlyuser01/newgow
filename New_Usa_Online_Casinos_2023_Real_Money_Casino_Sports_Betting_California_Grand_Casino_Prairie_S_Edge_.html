    <h1>New Usa Online Casinos 2023 Real Money Casino Sports Betting California Grand Casino Prairie S Edge</h1>

<p>With Native Gaming planning a new ground-breaking slot game and Atari pushing ahead with its own cryptocurrency token, a new alliance has been forged by both companies allowing them to achieve mutually beneficial synergies for their upcoming products.</p>
<p>Atari Pushes for Broader Adoption of Native Crypto Token</p>
<p>Still a few months from releasing, the Atari Token is already to be listed on iGaming operator Native Gaming’s upcoming Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) as well as on the casino’s library of casino slots.</p>
<p>The move is possible with the help of a newly-forged alliance between Atari, one of the leading consumer brands and entertainment producers, and Native Gaming and Black Dog Venture Partners, which will oversee the integration of the token into Native’s innovative portfolio of games.</p>
<p>New Slot Mechanic: Monster Capturing</p>
<p>Native Gaming is completely changing the paradigm for online casino gaming by featuring an MMO Slot Game which will uproot the traditional “spin for a chance to win mechanic,” and replace it with a full-scale video game which will introduce monster-catching gameplay.</p>
<p>The gameplay premise is already popular outside the iGaming world, but this will be the first time someone has tried to carry it over to the online casino world. Native Gaming’s new slot game will allow players to hunt monsters and capture them in a Pokémon-like style.</p>
<p>Players can then summon their captured monsters to participate in duels or just retrieve the monsters and cash them in for rewards. While the MMO Slot is still a work in progress and no official release date has been given, both Atari and Native Gaming seem confident in their new alliance.</p>
<p>Native Gaming and Atari Fully Behind the New Partnership</p>
<p>Speaking about the new partnership, Native Gaming CEO Justin McCool said that Native was excited to be a part of the transformation that Atari brings to the casino and blockchain space. He further added that it would be hard to imagine “a more appropriate partner to help us take our new Native MMORPG Casino Slot Game to market and bridge the gap between gamers, gamblers, and the cryptocurrency community.”</p>
<p>Atari CEO Fred Chesnais was equally thrilled at the newly-established partnership, expanding the company’s footprint in online gaming and blockchain further. Previously, Atari signed two pivotal partnerships with the Litecoin Foundation and the Arkane Network.</p>
<p>Chesnais said that Native Gaming was developing a completely new type of online gambling experience and that Atari was excited to be part of that as well. He noted that the integration of the Atari Token would allow gamers and gamblers the opportunity to carry out payments using this specific solution and add new financial options as well as payment flexibility for consumers.</p>
<p>Atari and Native Gaming: Two Casino Disruptors</p>
<p>The Atari Token is the work of Atari Chain Ltd., a subsidiary operating under Atari SA, created specifically for the purposes of expanding the company’s footprint into the field of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Native Gaming on the other hand is a promising new online casino project which allows players to “Be the House” by offering them to take a stake in the bankroll. As a result, any stakeholder receives a share of the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) generated throughout a partnership network of 5,000+ casino games developed by 70+ leading software developers, including Evolution Gaming, NetEnt, Microgaming and Play’n GO.</p>
