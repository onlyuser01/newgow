<p>The Game Invites the Players on an Exciting Wild West Adventure</p>
<p>RubyPlay’s new slot game features symbols that are in line with its wild west theme. Such include pistols, a safe full of gold, a bag of money, a sheriff, an outlaw, as well as a rider. The game also incorporates standard card symbols that match its Western theme. A special symbol that helps unlock additional prizes is the sheriff badge.</p>
<p>Dr Eyal Loz, RubyPlay’s CPO, shared her excitement about the latest release. She pointed out that the new game invites the players on a thrilling adventure to the wild west. Additionally, Loz spoke about True Wild’s engaging features that grant the players a chance to secure big prizes. Finally, she acknowledged the new game stands out from the competition by delivering a modern twist on engaging mechanics.</p>
<p>“True Wild offers a fun experience with some intriguing concepts for players to discover. Features like Sliding Reel and Outlaw epitomize how RubyPlay is differentiating from the competition by adding modern twists on popular game mechanics.“ Dr Eyal Loz, CPO of RubyPlay</p>
<p>Outlaw Bonus Round Can Bring Huge Prizes</p>
<p>The latest slot game from RubyPlay offers a Sliding Reel functionality. This is triggered whenever a player lands a Sheriff Badge symbol on the top or middle position of the reel. “The star locks and slides down one position for each spin, providing players with an increased opportunity to trigger the Outlaw feature,” explained the game developer.</p>
<p>To activate the Outlaw round, players need to land six or more stars on the reel. Consequently, a special bonus round is activated and players receive three spins. The appearance of new Sheriff Badge symbols resets the respin to three until the reel is filled with those symbols or there are no more free spins.</p>
<p>Players that are lucky to fill the reel with Sheriff Badge symbols can then unlock a special bonus game on its left side. This bonus can unlock multipliers, as well as one out of the four jackpots True Wild offers. The jackpots include Mini, Minor, Major and Grand, elevating further the excitement of the gameplay.</p>
