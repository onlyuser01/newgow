    <h1>Niagara Falls Canada Casino Prima Play Casino Casino Guitars Saratoga Casino Hotel Casino In Iowa Cl</h1>

<p>Dear maredibetty2,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting Nick's claims and the casino's decision.</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - multiple free bonuses were redeemed consecutively without making a deposit. From the evidence provided by Nick, I could see that there were used a few no-deposit bonuses without a real-money deposit.</p>
<p>It is the players' obligation to read the terms and conditions before accepting them. Moreover, we are talking about no-deposit bonuses and free money. The casinos can limit this free money as they see fit unless it is not against our Fair Gambling Codex. The ideal case would be if the casinos enforce their rules by software. But, currently, it is not an industry standard and therefore, we are able to accept it. In addition, it makes sense that any casino will not give its players only free money until they win and play the no-deposit bonus by the rules that they set.</p>
<p>The applied rules are available - HERE in section "Rules" - "No Deposit Bonuses (Free Chips, Free Spins)", rules 4. and 17. Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at endri.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Nick and Club Player Casino, for providing the necessary details and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Endri, Casino.Guru</p>
