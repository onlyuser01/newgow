    <h1>Mirage Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nevada Double Eagle Casino Casino In Santa Rosa Greek Town Casino The</h1>

<p>Online gaming company Mansion Group announced today it has signed a partnership with Les Ambassadeurs Club, a club and casino located in Mayfair, London, to offer online casino players a chance to experience live play at the private club.</p>
<p>Premier London Gambling Location</p>
<p>The partnership between Mansion Group and Les Ambassadeurs Club will allow players at MansionCasino, Casino.com and Slots Heaven brands to access live casino games from the private club located in the heart of London. Online players will be able to play at Baccarat and Roulette tables alongside the club’s members.</p>
<p>The club known as ‘Les A’ was established in Hanover Square in 1941 and moved to its current location at Hamilton Place nine years later. The members-only club was owned by its founder John Mills for 40 years, changed several owners since 1981 and is currently owned by Chinese businessman and Birmingham City FC owner Paul Ho Chung Suen.</p>
<p>In 1961, the club housed Le Cercle casino following the passing of the Betting and Gaming Act 1960. The casino operated until 1978 when it lost its license for breaches of the Betting and Gaming Act.</p>
<p>Les Ambassadeurs Club is recognized as one of the premier gambling locations in London and its membership list features high-profile members from the world of sports, entertainment and finance industries. The private club featured in the inaugural James Bond film ‘Dr. No’ as well as in scenes from the film about The Beatles ‘A Hard Day’s Night’.</p>
<p>Premier Online Casino Destination</p>
<p>Gibraltar-headquartered Mansion Group has been providing online sports betting and gaming for over 18 years, featuring a portfolio of gaming brands and an international player base enjoying the group’s offering comprising sports wagering, slots, live casino games and poker.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mansion Group conducted a detailed review of the sports betting market and regulations in the UK and announced it would discontinue sportsbook operations, including via its flagship MansionBet brand.</p>
<p>The decision to abandon the sports betting vertical Mansion Group explained with the need to focus entirely on its three online casino brands.</p>
<p>Mansion’s move to discontinue sports betting operations affected the group’s existing sponsorship deal with English Football League side Bristol City FC and the club was left with no other choice but to terminate the agreement with the operator.</p>
