<p>Live Casino Experience at Caesars’ New Jersey Gaming Venue</p>
<p>Live dealer casino gaming provider Ezugi has joined forces with casino-entertainment company Caesars Entertainment, thus entering the US market and the state of New Jersey in particular.</p>

<p>Monica Umana, vice president of America at Ezugi endorsed the partnership and expressed her excitement to be teaming up with one of the biggest names in the casino industry. Umana highlighted the popularity of Ezugi games among players and said she was thrilled that people at Caesars Casino &amp; Sports New Jersey will already be able to enjoy this experience.</p>
<p>Umana added that live casinos combine the positive features of both online gaming and gaming in person, as players enjoy the social interaction in the venue, but at the same time have the benefit of the online play. All titles on the list will be streamed in high quality from the Ezugi studio located in the Mid-Atlantic state.</p>
<p>In relation to the agreement, Christian Stuart, head of Caesars sports and online gaming, said that Caesars has a positive view about this iGaming opportunity and will strive to offer its players an experience of the highest quality.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming Completed Acquisition of Ezugi Last Year</p>
<p>Ezugi is now owned by the Stockholm-listed Evolution Gaming after the completion of the acquisition in September last year. The all-cash deal was initially valued at $12 million with possible additional consideration of $6 million. Evolution Gaming aimed at increasing its presence in already-existing markets and boost its studio capacity as well as funds in product development.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming announced positive Q32020 financial results – revenue increased by 48% to €140 million EBITDA grew by 87% to €97 million. Profit for the period corresponded to €79.4 million, while earnings per share were €0.44.</p>
<p>According to CEO Martin Carlesund, there was a high demand for Evolution games globally and due to this demand, the company continued its investment strategy in additional studio capacity. This year, the company opened a Lithuanian studio, also expanded in Tbilisi, Pennsylvania, and Malta, among others. At the beginning of November, Evolution sealed a deal to supply a range of live-dealer games to prominent American online casino and sportsbook operator FanDuel Group.</p>
