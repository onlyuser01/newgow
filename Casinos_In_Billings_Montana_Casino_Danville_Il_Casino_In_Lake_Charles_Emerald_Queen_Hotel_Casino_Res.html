<p>The agreement will allow Markor Tech to provide its operator partners with many exciting live casino titles</p>
<p>Markor Technology, a B2B and B2C provider of iGaming technology, has taken steps to further expand its live casino portfolio by inking an agreement with Skywind. The latter company, which is an acclaimed supplier of gaming technology and content, will bolster Markor’s aggregation platform with new games.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Markor will secure access to a variety of top-performing live casino titles. These include both classic games and innovative variations of player favorites such as Live Baccarat, Live Blackjack and Live Roulette. Skywind will also provide its new partner with a variety of game show-inspired titles.</p>
<p>Skywind is a famous supplier of content, known for its dedication to quality. Its games are streamed from four premium studios around the world, ensuring that fans receive the best live casino content possible. The company also boasts a rich portfolio of slot games, which numbers hundreds of unique titles.</p>
<p>By teaming up with Markor Technology, Skywind will be able to further expand its global footprint and augment its presence in certain key regulated jurisdictions. The two companies are certain that the deal will benefit both of them and are looking forward to working together.</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the Two Companies Addressed the Deal</p>
<p>Skywind’s senior partner manager, Alina Popa, addressed the newly-formed partnership. She said that her team has been impressed by how quickly Markor Technology has built up an impressive aggregation service, despite being a fairly young company. Popa added that Skywind is glad to be able to further reinforce Markor’s content lineup.</p>
<p>As a company that works with a huge number of casino operators in a variety of markets worldwide, teaming up with Markor will allow us to put our games in front of even more new players, while at the same time ensuring that they can continue to deliver market-leading content to their online partners. Alina Popa</p>
<p>Melissa Summerfield, Markor Technology’s chief executive officer, also shared her thoughts. She noted that Skywind, just like Markor, is a global content-driven iGaming tech company. Therefore, Summerfield’s team could not have picked a better and more knowledgeable partner to work with when expanding its aggregation portfolio.</p>
<p>Summerfield concluded that joining forces with Skywind would allow Markor to expand its engaging selection of live casino titles and provide its operator partners with thrilling new titles. She is sure that the new games will generate a lot of value for the casino companies Markor is working with.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Markor secured a license from the AGCO, which allowed it to enter Ontario.</p>
