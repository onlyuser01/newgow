<p>Hi pearlnecklace,</p>
<p>thank you for your comments.</p>
<p>Please know that you cannot register in the casino without agreeing (reading) to our Terms and Conditions, and it clearly states in the T&amp;C that "10.4.6 To ensure proper use of bonuses and fair play, HazCasino.com considers claiming Weekend Party bonuses without any other clean deposit (i.e. deposit which is not matched with any bonus) during the week as irregular gameplay to take advantage of bonuses. Players must deposit at least 150€ during the week in order to be eligible for winnings generated with Weekend Party Bonuses if they later decide to play slot games with mentioned deposit and 300€ in case of table games play. In case of irregular play mentioned above, winnings generated with Weekend Party Bonuses will be forfeited and deposit returned."</p>
<p>So, a player would have to deposit at least 150€ during the week in order to be eligible for the winnings that derive from Weekend Party Bonuses. After thoroughly checking your deposits it was noticed that during that week you haven’t made any deposits (matched or clean), hence the decision to forfeit the winnings.</p>
<p>Just to note, the bonus hasn’t been given to you. The bonus is available to all the players on the cashier and players have to claim it themselves before making a deposit!</p>
<p>Furthermore, casinos that are operated by Mirage Corporation N.V. are not sister casinos. They are white labels and are only connected to the platform they are run.</p>
<p>Haz Casino isn’t a sister casino to Space Lilly or Goldenstar that you have mentioned.</p>
<p>Anyway, if Casino Guru needs proof regarding deposits then please let me know and we’ll gladly provide everything you need.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Anton</p>
