    <h1>Casino Montreal Matrix Casino Ac Hotel Casinos Stellaris Casino San Juan Captain Jacks Casino Spribe</h1>

<p>Aviator is a global blockbuster and the most played crash-style game that the gambling industry has seen in its time</p>
<p>Moving forward, Spribe’s Aviator game will be featured across SkillOnNet’s entire portfolio of casino brands. Among those are PlayOJO, Spin Genie, Genting Casino, and BacanaPlay. SkillOnNet has cemented its position as one of the most trusted and exciting purveyors of casino brands and the underpinning software that makes them tick so smoothly.</p>
<p>Aviator Takes Off from SkillOnNet’s Runway</p>
<p>However, it’s thanks to the introduction of games such as Aviator that things have been changing for the better as well. Aviator is a global blockbuster and the most played crash-style game that the gambling industry has seen in its time. Aviator will arrive across a range of casinos, including LuckyNiki, SlotsMagic and Slingo.com, besides the ones already mentioned.</p>
<p>In terms of how well the game performs, Aviator has more than 10 million monthly active players, which has made it an absolute success for the company. The Aviator concept is simple as it allows players to push their luck and try to get even better payouts for the same amounts they have wagered.</p>
<p>Aviator also has a huge social factor whereby players join a game together to see how far they can make it before their plane crashes. Of course, ejecting before that happens is the way to collect winnings at Aviator, as is with most crash-style games for that matter.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, SkillOnNet’s head of games, Jani Kontturi, said that the genre has become very popular in markets across Europe, and Spribe’s Aviator is simply the best solution to have featured.</p>
<p>Aviator’s Appeal Continues to Strike Home with Fans Worldwide</p>
<p>The game provides a range of intuitive and original features, promising big wins, thrilling gameplay, and so much more. Kontturi added:</p>
<p>We go to great lengths to stock our lobbies with a wide range of casino games, from slots to live dealer, and of course crash games, and we now have the number one crash game in the world in our portfolio. This is what makes us an award-winning online casino operator and why other brands use the SkillOnNet platform to power their sites. SkillOnNet’s head of games, Jani Kontturi</p>
<p>Spribe head of business development Denis Didenko was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see the company game featured in one of the biggest distribution networks. He was confident that Aviator is bound to become a hit with SkillOnNet’s own brands and player bases as it has with millions of people worldwide.</p>
<p>Spribe has been steadily growing with individual partnerships, including a recent tie-up with Alea. Apart from that, the company also agreed to a content alliance with Groove Aggregator to reach even bigger audiences.</p>
