<p>Lucky Dragon review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Lucky Dragon is a minimalist slot in the fashion of many old time one armed bandits, but with a Chinese-style twist. The background is a slightly abstracted bit of red and gold Chinese architecture with two stone dragons propping up the reels.</p>
<p>On the reels themselves are the Lucky Dragons of the title, Chinese lanterns, and a selection of gold coins with square holes in the centre.</p>
<p>The thematic elements are largely interchangeable with many other slots of its kind, but are rendered in a rather more artistically impressive style than a lot of other slots that evoke the same kind of Imperial Chinese aesthetic.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are top quality for such a simple slot. The artwork is lovely, the design atmospheric and thematically consistent.</p>
<p>The animations emphasise the action on screen and work well with the soundtrack of win and spin sounds. However, they are never over-egged and the goal is to imitate a real-life slot machine more than a display of digital trickery. For example, when key events occur, the reels move forward to emphasise the excitement, and recede as normal play resumes.</p>
<p>The music is impressive and varied depending on how well the player is doing at any given time. Overall, the design is a unified whole that works well to engage the player.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lucky Dragon is a simple three-reel slot. It uses the five straight lines as win lines, and wins are only achieved for three symbols, one per reel, on each win line.</p>
<p>With no bonuses, randomised features, or gamble games, this is a minimalist slot. That doesn’t appeal to everyone, but if it’s what you’re looking for, this game does it pretty well.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Jackpot symbol. It only plays as Wild if it lands covering all three positions on the reel. Wins that include a Wild are doubled.</p>
<p>The Jackpot symbol plays like any other symbol, however, its value is determined by the size of the progressive jackpot. It is worth noting that this symbol is not a Scatter; the player must get three Jackpot symbols on a winline in order to win the jackpot.</p>
<p>Two winlines big win with top paying symbol of the game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.56%, which is a little under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%. Slots with below average slots tend not to get our recommendation as they tend to be expensive to play.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€25.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which would be a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies, if only it were coupled with a higher RTP.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Lucky Dragon is an excellent slot in its category in most regards. If you like bells and whistles, this one isn’t for you. But there aren’t many minimalist slots with as satisfying a set of animations and sound cues.</p>
<p>The high volatility is appealing, and goes some way to mitigating the rather low RTP (95.56%). Any players who do opt to give this one a go, will want to bear in mind the size of the vig.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s a pretty good slot.</p>
