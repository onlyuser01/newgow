<p>Users will also be able to tap into live programming, including WPT 2020-2021 events and tournaments broadcast from the HyperX Esports Arena at The Luxor, Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>Executives Embrace the Blockchain-Powered Streaming Partnership</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent tie-up, Theta Labs CEO and co-founder, Mitch Liu, said that both Theta and WPT are innovators in their respective fields and, therefore, their partnership constitutes a ground-breaking opportunity to bring quality televised poker into the world. In March, Theta added another key partner, Contentos, helping its slash the cost of operating its decentralized video protocol by another 50%.</p>
<p>Liu emphasized on Theta‚Äôs peer-to-peer blockchain technology and said that the companies would seek deeper integration of their products. Traditionally focused on esports, Theta.tv has now shifted the focus on WPT, signing a first major partnership outside of video gaming.</p>
<p>Users will be able to earn the company‚Äôs proprietor TFUEL token rewards simply for sharing bandwidth and watching premium WPT poker content. Adam Pliska, CEO of World Poker Tour, didn‚Äôt hide his enthusiasm, arguing that the WPT looked forward to benefiting from Theta Blockchain ‚Äì ‚Äúan innovator in the streaming space.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pliska doesn‚Äôt want to stop there, and he has confirmed that the WPT and Theta Labs would seek deeper integration moving forward.</p>
<p>How Does Theta.tv Work?</p>
<p>Theta.tv is based on a simple premise. The platform allows users to share bandwidth while watching videos and streams, pushing down the overall cost of video streaming and generation the so-called TFUEL tokens while at it.</p>
<p>Theta received generous backing from Samsung NEXT and Blockchain and the platform has the funds to run through 2021, Forbes reported last year. Samsung is similarly involved in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Earlier this month, Samsung allowed TRON dApps on its Galaxy Store, an important pivotal moment for TRON.</p>
