<p>What Is a Gambler Hat?</p>
<p>A gambler hat is a head covering that is associated with your lifestyle as a gambler. While there are hundreds of possible head coverings and hats out there, nothing screams gambling the same way as a cowboy hat, and if you were to ask your average American what hat would be most fitting to a person whose lifestyle involves taking a risk at games of chance, a cowboy hat would be the unanimous answer.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing specific about the wide-brim hat that is often associated with the Southern states. Rather, popular culture has continuously tilted at the idea that cowboys and gamblers somehow mix, and through sheer chance or fate, the gambler cowboy hat is a staple of the gambling man.</p>
<p>There are generally two types of gambler hats. The first one is the wide-brim cowboy hat and the other one is the so-called classic planter’s hat, which has a much smaller brim and a somewhat more elegant, gentlemanly look.</p>
<p>If you are to wear a gambler’s hat, you will probably have to pick the size, color, and admittedly the size of the brim. Your choice is pretty much a toss-up between the planter’s hat and cowboy-style wear, both of which can give you a dashing look. Here is our list of the best ten gambler hats you can wear today.</p>
<p>When Did the Gambler Style Cowboy Hat Come Out?</p>
<p>The history of the cowboy hat as a staple of gambling culture is not documented, but if we were to speculate, gambling originated in the Wild West, where cowboys and townspeople all wore such head coverings.</p>
<p>Cowboys would use their hats indoors to cover their faces so that their opponents would not be able to read any tells off during a saloon game of poker, for example. Then, popular culture came along, and the gambler-style cowboy hat was taken at face value.</p>
<p>In Clint Black’s song “A Good Run of Bad Luck,” he is wearing a cowboy hat and singing about gambling, for example. There are other cultural references just like this one!</p>
