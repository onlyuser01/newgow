<p>Scientific Games has once again expressed its commitment to responsible gaming education by backing the National Council on Problem Gambling’s annual Gift Responsibly campaign. This is notably the sixth holiday season the digital games, technology and analytics company has promoted the initiative.</p>
<p>The campaign advocates against the gifting of lottery cards to minors during the holidays, alleging that such gifts can lead to gambling harm. Exposure to such content from a young age risks normalizing gambling to kids and teaching them to associate gambling with festivities.</p>
<p>Scientific Games prides itself on being an exemplary company when it comes to responsible gambling. The company’s Healthy Play program, for example, provides a number of reliable science-based tools and practices that lottery operators can use to protect their players and prevent minors from participating in games of chance. The program was recently awarded a 2023 Communitas Award for Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>
<p>In addition, Scientific Games’ Responsible Gaming Study and toolkit provides further insights into the sector, increasing lottery literacy and encouraging healthy play. The company is one of the first lottery providers to ever receive global certification as a Responsible Gaming Supplier from the World Lottery Association.</p>
<p>Minors Should Never Play the Lottery</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, praised Scientific Games’ commitment to promoting the Gift Responsibly campaign. He said that the company’s participation in the initiative will help to reduce youth problem gambling.</p>
<p>Whyte added that minors should not play lotteries, not even during the holidays.</p>
<p>Lottery games should never be given to minors, during the holidays or at any other time. Childhood exposure to lottery products can lead to lifelong problems, and youth problem gambling is a public health issue. Keith Whyte, exec director, NCPG</p>
<p>Carla Schaefer, Scientific Games’ vice president of responsible gaming, also commented on the matter, praising the Gift Responsibly campaign. She said that the initiative aligns with her company’s desire to prevent youth problem gambling and promote responsible lottery participation.</p>
