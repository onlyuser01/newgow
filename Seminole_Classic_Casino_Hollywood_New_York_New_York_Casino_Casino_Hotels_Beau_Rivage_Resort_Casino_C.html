    <h1>Seminole Classic Casino Hollywood New York New York Casino Casino Hotels Beau Rivage Resort Casino C</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru team</p>
<p>Dear Amok Casino team</p>
<p>I refer below to an identical complaint already answered by Casino Guru:</p>
<p>Amok Casino - Player complains that he shouldn't be able to play. (casinoguru-de.com)</p>
<p>Below I am filing an official complaint against Amokcasino with license number MAG/B2C/367/2016.</p>
<p>First I would like to mention that I have been playing at Amokcasino for months and I consistently consider the casino to be a reputable casino. Payouts were always made quickly and the support always responded to my inquiries in a friendly, accommodating and quick manner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to state that the licensed casino with the name Amokcasino violated the RESPONSIBLE GAMING policy. On March 23, 2022 I got banned from all online casinos. Due to my gambling addiction, I tried to create an account at an online casino last night, but without success. I tried to create an account at around 300 online casinos, but unfortunately I was – rightly so – blocked everywhere. A single exception in the entire online casino universe is your Amokcasino. Here I was able to keep depositing and losing. This although I am also blocked from their subsidiaries (Refuel Casino, Mount Gold Casino). For this reason, I regret to assume that Amok Casino would continue to let me deposit and play, although I'm sure you received a message to close my account as well. Unfortunately, I was still able to deposit and since March 23, 2022 I have deposited and lost over 12,000 euros.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I got a message from Amok Casino that I need to submit my bank statements (deposits and withdrawals from the last 2 months) in order to continue playing. When I asked for a cash bonus they said they couldn't give me one as I have to disclose my sources of funds first. Nevertheless, I was able to keep depositing and earn over 12,000 euros. It was only when I said to close my account that I received a cash bonus of 300 euros so that I could continue playing at your casino.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to deposit 70 euros and got the message that I can't make any deposits because I didn't submit the account movements required and described above. Amok Casino has been asking me for these documents for weeks and I was still able to deposit over 12,000 euros. Today I couldn't make any deposits because I didn't submit my account activity. Why can't I make any deposits until today? You've been asking about the account movements for weeks and I was still able to continue depositing and playing. It's also questionable that I'm banned online at every imaginable casino worldwide, with one exception. Amok Casino. Can you confirm that you have not received a message to suspend my account? Why have I been able to make deposits in the past few weeks without submitting any account documents? And why can't I deposit today because I didn't submit any account documents.</p>
<p>I am reclaiming from Amok Casino my deposited and lost money since the account was closed with their sister companies and I kindly ask the casino to adhere to the RESPONSIBLE GAMING policy going forward. It is important that Infiniza Limited casinos are aware of their responsibility for RESPONSIBLE GAMING and take all measures to ensure that gambling addicts do not re-offend. Since the casino had been asking me for more documents to verify my sources of funds for weeks, it was obviously clear that I would be screened for gambling addiction. The suspicion of gambling addiction was therefore given. The fact that I was able to deposit more than 12,000 euros even though I didn't submit the documents is questionable. The fact that I couldn't make a deposit today because I didn't submit the documents mentioned confirms the arbitrariness of the casino.</p>
<p>It is also questionable that I got banned from Amok Casino's sister casinos (Refuel Casino, Mount Gold Casino) for gambling addiction but was able to continue to deposit and lose at Amok Casino.</p>
<p>I have always been a loyal one and I am now politely asking the casino to review my case and make sure everything went correctly in terms of RESPONSIBLE GAMING. I believe that Amok Casino has violated the RESPONSIBLE GAMING policy. It's really suspicious that Amok Casino is the only casino far and wide that I was still able to deposit and play at. For this reason I have been claiming my losses back since March 23, 2022 or since I was banned from the two sister casinos for gambling addiction.</p>
