<p>Maine has published the proposed rules for betting ahead of the official launch of sports wagering in the state</p>
<p>Maine may see its sports betting market open by the end of the year. Wagering on sports was legalized in 2022 but no sportsbooks are operating in the state as of yet.</p>
<p>Full Steam Ahead with Sports Betting</p>
<p>Sports betting was greenlit in August, following the signing of LD 585 in May. Thanks to this, the Pine Tree State has now legalized sports punts, albeit it has not yet launched betting officially.</p>
<p>Under Maine’s betting regime, up to 10 retail sportsbooks and up to 4 online sports betting sites would be allowed to operate in the state. The online licenses will be handed to the four recognized tribes in Maine. This was a move on Democratic Governor Janet Mills’ side to appease the tribes following her recent veto threat.</p>
<p>Maine’s sports betting market is expected to launch either this year or early next year. No approximate date has been given by the state’s regulator either.</p>
<p>Maine Published the Proposed Betting Rules</p>
<p>As the time to launch sports betting for real approaches, the Maine Gambling Control Unit published the proposed rules for the vertical. While the regulations outlined by the Control Unit are not set in stone yet, they provide a sneak peek at what’s to come.</p>
<p>The state regulator had been working on drafting the rules for the past two weeks and was busy consulting stakeholders about their views on the matter. Furthermore, the regulator has scheduled a public hearing for January 31 when it will discuss its regulatory vision in greater depth.</p>
<p>Milt Champion, the Maine Gambling Control Unit’s executive director noted that the state will likely issue sports betting licenses between April and January. However, he added that no exact dates can be discussed yet, regardless of how impatient the public is.</p>
<p>I know this is a hot topic. I know everybody wants it out during the Super Bowl or during March Madness. But let’s face it. It’s just not going to happen. Milt Champion, exec director, Maine Gambling Control Unit</p>
<p>He previously said that he doesn’t like to disappoint people but prefers to be realistic when it comes to such matters.</p>
<p>While Champion forwent mentioning exact dates, he certainly confirmed that sports betting will not be coming in the next few months. The process would continue moving slowly toward the eventual launch of sports betting when Maine punters will be finally able to join the multi-state community of sports bettors.</p>
