    <h1>Casino Names Las Vegas Casino Hotel Eldorado Hotel And Casino Real Money Casinos Online Cepheus Star</h1>

<p>Apparat Gaming, a developer of slots “with a German accent,” has teamed up with SkillOnNet, a global gaming company. As a result, the latter company has adopted Apparat’s unique games into its portfolio, launching them across numerous iGaming brands in multiple markets.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming is a distinctly German company that excels in developing games for German players. The supplier’s content has been quickly gaining traction thanks to its dedication to excellence, reflected in its high-quality games.</p>
<p>Despite being tailored to the needs of gamblers in Germany, Apparat Gaming’s slots are, in fact, also suitable for a variety of markets. One of the latest deals, for example, saw the company team up with Swiss4Win in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Under the current deal, Apparat Gaming’s content will make its way into SkillOnNet’s portfolio, with a particular focus on DrückGlück, the latter company’s flagship German casino. As a result, DrückGlück players will get to experience outstanding gaming titles, such as Total Eclipse, Jack Potter &amp; The Book of Dynasties and The Warlock’s Book.</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming’s latest releases, 7 Supernova Fruits and Mallorca Wilds, will also be available to SkillOnNet Players.</p>
<p>DrückGlück is one of Germany’s first legal online casinos and is a leading brand in Germany. Thanks to that, Apparat Gaming will be able to greatly expand its footprint in its home market.</p>
<p>If a Game Works in Germany, It Will Work Anywhere</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming director Thomas Wendt said that the partnership with SkillOnNet “represents an exciting new chapter” in Apparat’s story. He noted that he is proud of everything his team has achieved since the company launched and added that he is looking forward to working with SkillOnNet.</p>
<p>Wendt described SkillOnNet as a best-in-class B2B and B2C company and a valuable partner.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet as a tier-one operator and provider is a must-have partner for us, and we really hope this is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership. Thomas Wendt, director, Apparat Gaming</p>
<p>Jani Kontturi, SkillOnNet’s head of games, also commented on the matter. He said that Germany is a major European market and praised Germans as “some of the most discerning players.” Because of that, Kontturi believes that if a game works in Germany, it will work anywhere. As a proven designer of games for German audiences, Apparat Gaming will be an important ally of SkillOnNet.</p>
<p>Apparat has decades of experience in building games, and like all self-respecting German companies, they focus on technical excellence and innovation. That’s why we’re delighted to have them on board. Jani Kontturi, head of games, SkillOnNet</p>
<p>SkillOnNet operates over 30 iGaming brands and supplies solutions to even more casino companies. In July, the company teamed up with BF Games and Gaming Realms.</p>
