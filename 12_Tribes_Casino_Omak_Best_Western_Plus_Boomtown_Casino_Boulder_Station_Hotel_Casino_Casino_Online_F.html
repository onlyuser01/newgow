    <h1>12 Tribes Casino Omak Best Western Plus Boomtown Casino Boulder Station Hotel Casino Casino Online F</h1>

<p>I have made several deposits , hundreds of dollars, i play at MANY online casinos and this casino for sure has the worst payout odds. Any deposit you make you might as well chose another casino because your wasting your money here. You never actually win, they get you in with the sign up bonus and you hit big and odds are way better , but when you deposit your odds dramatically decrease. It’s ridiculous. Don’t waste your time on platinum reels. You will not win anything , iv played hundreds and hundreds of dollars betting anywhere between 20 cents and $4 per spin and my biggest single spin win was about 12 dollars betting 4 dollars . You spin and spin and your money just smokes down and down until you need another deposit , 95% of the "wins" on a slot machine are a fraction of the bet, for example iv bet .80 cents and and win every few spins between 2 and 6 cents, it is extremely rare to win more than your bet on any spin my guess is 1 in 50 spins you will win more than the actual bet placed for that spin. The odds of winning are set EXTREMELY LOW. The best casino I use is fortune jack , they are the best by far with best payouts , it’s night and day. I wish someone left me a review before depositing in platinum reels, as I also see if by the crazy chance you do win I read all the reviews of them not paying out and deleting accounts, I believe this site to be fraudulent and a scam, that’s my opinion from experience . The only good thing I can say is if you deposit and call they will award you free spins , iv done that 8-10 times and never won more than 6 bucks , the average free spin to continue gambling with is about $1.50-3.00</p>
