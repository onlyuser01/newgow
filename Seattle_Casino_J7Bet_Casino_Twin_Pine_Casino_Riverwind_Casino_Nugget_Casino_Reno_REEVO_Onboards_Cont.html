<p>REEVO, a fast-growing gaming content supplier and aggregator, has formed a new partnership with Betsoft Gaming, a leading provider of immersive slots, table games and player engagement tools.</p>
<p>Under the new deal, REEVO, which seeks to revolutionize the iGaming industry, will integrate Betsoft’s portfolio of innovative casino games into its portfolio. As a result, the former party will be able to deliver elevated gaming experiences to its multiple operator partners.</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming is popular for its engaging games, with high hit rates, exciting bonus rounds and high RTP. Player engagement is further enhanced through multiple player engagement tools that offer immersive gaming adventures. In addition, Betsoft Gaming’s titles sport visually stunning graphics and offer rapid downloads and seamless mobile gaming development.</p>
<p>REEVO’s partnering operators will now be able to access many engaging games with varying genres, themes and features. As a result, more players will be able to experience Betsoft Gaming’s proprietary engagement tools, including Take the Prize and Tournament.</p>
<p>The deal with Betsoft, which REEVO lauded as a “true frontrunner in the iGaming space,” follows multiple recent agreements between the aggregator and various gambling providers. One of the most recent agreements saw REEVO add Stakelogic titles to its roster.</p>
<p>REEVO currently offers 8,000+ games from more than 70 game providers and counting.</p>
<p>REEVO Will Provide More Content to Its Clients and Their Players</p>
<p>REEVO’s head of sales, Petra Maria Poola, commented on the new deal, saying that it aligns with her team’s commitment to delivering high-quality gaming content to its clients and their players. Poola is certain that the new integration will present benefits to both companies.</p>
<p>With the integration of Betsoft’s innovative games into our platform, we are confident that this partnership will be mutually beneficial. Petra Maria Poola, head of sales, REEVO</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming’s head of account management, Fernando Van Velzen, also commented on the matter, expressing his delight about the opportunity to team up with a company “of REEVO’s caliber.”</p>
<p>Betsoft’s award-winning releases deliver the ultimate gaming experience to players and Reevo’s platforms will elevate accessibility. Our shared values and commitment will ensure the development of a long-term and successful relationship for everyone. Fernando Van Velzen, head of account management, Betsoft Gaming</p>
