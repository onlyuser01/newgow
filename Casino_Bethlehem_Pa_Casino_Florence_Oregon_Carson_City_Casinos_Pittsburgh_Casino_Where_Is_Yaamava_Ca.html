<p>Cowboys vs. Chargers is the Monday Night Football game of Week 6 of the 2023 NFL. The game is on the program on October 16, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are 3-2 this season, but in their most recent game, they got obliterated by the San Francisco 49ers 42-10. They play in California for the second week straight, but this time, they’re expected to do better.</p>
<p>It’s because they’re locking horns with the Los Angeles Chargers who are 2-2 in the 2023 NFL season. That might not seem too impressive, but these guys were actually pretty decent in each of those four games.</p>

<p>Cowboys Still Licking Their Wounds After Embarrassing Loss to Niners</p>
<p>Mike McCarthy’s men started the season in top gear, beating the New York Giants 40-0 in the first week of the season. They beat another NY-based side – the New York Jets – in the second week, this time with 30-10 on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Their first defeat of the 2023 NFL season happened in Week 3 when they, rather surprisingly, lost to the Arizona Cardinals 28-16 on the road. They bounced back the next week with an impressive 38-3 win over the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant performance by the Cowboys, who did relatively okay offensively but held a real defensive masterclass. Their quarterback Dak Prescott threw for just one touchdown (scored by CeeDee Lamb), while fullback Hunter Luepke scored a rushing TD.</p>
<p>The other two Dallas touchdowns were the work of Dallas’ defensive players. Linebacker Leighton Vander Esch scooped a fumble for a TD, while cornerback Daron Bland intercepted one of Mac Jones’ passes for a score.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Dallas fans, their defense wasn’t as brilliant last weekend. The Cowboys conceded 42 points to the Niners in San Fran. Their offense wasn’t great either. In fact, QB Prescott was horrible with three interceptions. He did record one TD pass, but that wasn’t enough for his team to avoid a proper humiliation.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers are Better Than What People Think</p>
<p>Sure, the Chargers might not be Super Bowl material in 2023, but they’ve been actually pretty decent so far. They’re 2-2 right now, with both of their losses happening by no more than a field goal.</p>
<p>In the first round, they lost to the Miami Dolphins 36-34, followed by a 27-24 overtime loss to the Tennessee Titans in the second round. After losing the first two games, they went on to win the next two.</p>

<p>The Chargers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 28-24 in Week 3; then, they beat the Las Vegas Raiders 24-17 in Week 4. They had a bye in Week 5, meaning that they’ve got plenty of time to prepare for the clash with Dallas.</p>
<p>That’s not the only thing going in their favor. They also play in front of their own fans at SoFi Stadium, which is where they’re 0-2 against Dallas. They sure want to finally beat the Cowboys at their new home, but do they have the manpower to pull off such a thing?</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs. Los Angeles Chargers Prediction</p>
<p>If you compared these two teams player-for-player, the Cowboys would probably have the edge. However, the Chargers have so many things going in their favor ahead of the MNF game of Week 6 that we really think they can win. But even if they don’t grab their third win of the season on Monday, they shouldn’t get humbled by Dallas.</p>
<p>Pick: Los Angeles Chargers +2.5</p>
