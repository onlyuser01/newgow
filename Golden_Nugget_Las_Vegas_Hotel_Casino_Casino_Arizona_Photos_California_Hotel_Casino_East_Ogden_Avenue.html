<p>Ahead of the first El Súper Clásico in the Mexican Liga MX in 2023, Guadalajara Chivas are just one point ahead of Club America. Both have been playing decent soccer over the last couple of weeks, which is why we expect to see a real thriller on Saturday.</p>

<p>Guadalajara Chivas Looking for Their Third Straight Home Win</p>
<p>Even though they have faithful fans, Guadalajara Chivas just haven’t been too dangerous at home. We’re not talking about this season only but the last one as well. In fact, in 2022 Apertura, they were the 10th-best team in the league in terms of home performance.</p>
<p>In 2023 Liga MX Clausura, they’re 6-3-2 overall with a 14-9 score difference, while their home record is 2-1-1 with 6 goals scored and 4 conceded. The good news for their fans is that both of those wins happened in their last two home games.</p>
<p>El capitán de @Chivas mostró su calidad y experiencia, Víctor Guzmán marcó dos goles de penal para el triunfo del Rebaño sobre Xolos.#LigaBBVAMX ⚽ #Clausura2023 pic.twitter.com/7BE9gj9jDp — Liga BBVA MX (@LigaBBVAMX) February 16, 2023</p>
<p>They defeated Club Tijuana 2-1 in mid-February and Santos Laguna 2-0 some two weeks ago. Captain Victor Guzman scored three of those four goals, making himself Guadalajara’s top scorer in 2023.</p>
<p>That’s kind of surprising as he’s a midfielder rather than a forward. Their forwards haven’t gotten much on target in 2023. The explanation for this is that their most expensive winger Alexis Vega is injured, the same as Isaac Brizuela. On top of everything, striker Jose Juan Macias remains injured and won’t return this season.</p>
<p>High Ambitions for Club America in 2023</p>
<p>Club America is the richest sports club in Mexico. Unlike Chivas Guadalajara whose policy is to sign only Mexican players, this team is packed with foreign stars. Chilean playmaker Diego Valdes is their most expensive player, along with Spanish striker Alvaro Fidalgo, and his Uruguayan colleague from the front three, Jonathan Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Still, Club America’s most important player in 2023 is Mexican striker Henry Martin. The skipper has scored 10 goals already, which makes him the scoring leader of the 2023 Liga MX Clausura. Thanks to his output, his team now has 23 goals scored, which is more than any other team in the league.</p>
<p>What’s got to worry them is that they’ve conceded 14 goals already. There are six teams that have conceded fewer than that, Guadalajara Chivas included.</p>
<p>Guadalajara Chivas vs Club America Prediction</p>
<p>Guadalajara Chivas’ strongest weapon is their defense, but they’re not great in the offense. When it comes to Club America, it’s almost the opposite – they’re superb in the offense while their defense is somewhat leaky.</p>
<p>So, what to expect from the first El Súper Clásico of 2023? We think there will be some goals on Saturday, although not too many. And Club America should be the side to score more.</p>
<p>Pick: Club America to win</p>
