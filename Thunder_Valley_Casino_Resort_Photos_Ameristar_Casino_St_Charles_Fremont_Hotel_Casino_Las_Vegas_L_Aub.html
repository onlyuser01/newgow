    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Photos Ameristar Casino St Charles Fremont Hotel Casino Las Vegas L Aub</h1>

<p>Hello, I just wanted to tell you that this casino are operating and marketing in Norway, and offer bonus to Norwegian players, even if I get another expression here on casino guru ? They are a part of the Unibet group in some way. Whilst doing so, they offer payment as Visa and more. They ensure that I as a Norwegian customer will get paid if I win. I won 8000 NOK. Due to troubleshooting with paying my wins directly to the Norwegian banc, which the Casino should have known and informed me about, my 8000 NOK was rejected and returned from the banc the 17th of April and was back with the casino-provider the 20th of April. It seems like the people working in the casino kept on asking me for proofs for the return, document from the banc proving the return, long after the casino economic department knew that the money was returned, according to support in chat, who gave me an ID of the return. I am sorry to say that they now keep on telling me that their provider has still not returned the money to the casino. Today it is the 7th of May, and I am still waiting. I am disappointed in how the casino handle my case. I have been patiently and asked them friendly to solve this, both in chat and mail, since the money came back to what they call their provider the 20th of April. Since they gave me green light in using the casino in the first place it is their responsibility to solve this in a trustworthy way. They should have told me what I later learned by myself that Revolut visa is an opportunity to use</p>
<p>I hope it will be a help in sharing this with you, both for me and others.</p>
<p>Sincerely Astarte</p>
