<p>The Seattle Seahawks Coming in with Wilson</p>
<p>The Seahawks are not a team that historically does well in their season opener and many teams use them as barometers to determine if they are capable of making it to the later stages of the competition. Whether history is about to repeat itself is one thing, but rumors that Russell Wilson may be dropping from the roster had fans worried.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Seahawks have confirmed that the team will depend on Wilson once again. With Seahawk winning the 2014 Super Bowl, the team has been in a slump ever since, and pressure is mounting to make things work. Wilson is a veteran and he needs 10 more wins to achieve another milestone in his career.</p>
<p>Russell Wilson needs 8 wins to surpass Peyton Manning (105) for the most wins by a QB in his first 10 seasons in #NFL history.</p>

<p>Offensively, Seattle will have to rely on other players outside of Wilson, who is a little hard-pressed to keep up with the NFL’s average, although his most recent performance in the pre-season wasn’t too shabby. A lot is riding on him, but the Hawks will also have DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett to rely on this time around.</p>
<p>Running back Chris Carson has been able to hit 1,000 rushing yards twice in the past three years, meaning that he will be a much-valued chess piece on Sunday that coach Pete Carroll won’t be shy about using.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest issue with the Seahawks has not been so much the lack of successful offense as it has been the lack of good defense. This time around we have Jamal Adams who already had a full season with the Seahawks and he will be joining Carlos Dunlap II, boosting Seattle’s hopes of not ceding ground easily. In many ways, this seems to be the best defense setup and others, such as Bobby Wagner and Quandre Diggs are going to add a lot of value.</p>
<p>How Are the Colts Faring in Their Game One?</p>
<p>Now, the Colts are clearly in the lead for this one. Yet, they too face some quarterback troubles. Carson Wentz is the latest addition who will be spearheading Indianapolis’ attack under the guidance of head coach Frank Reich. The good news is that the pair have worked together before. Wentz was questionable for the start as he wasn’t vaccinated against COVID-19, but all seems to be cleared up.</p>

<p>Jonathan Taylor has already posted 1,000 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns as a rookie, which means that the Colts have a powerful lineup capable of delivering. So far as the team’s main game, it will ride on DeForest Buckner and Darius Leonard who have been pivotal for the Colts’ most recent successes. Indianapolis has a huge chance to make the playoffs this season and even get to a Super Bowl. It all starts on Sunday.</p>
