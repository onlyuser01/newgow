<p>Rank Group, a gambling company based in the United Kingdom, has reinforced its team with a new head of its remuneration committee. The one joining the company is Lucinda Charles-Jones who will replace the current committee head, Steven Esom. The new appointee has also been named as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement.</p>
<p>Rank Group Parts Ways with Esom, Welcomes Charles-Jones</p>
<p>Rank Group will part ways with Esom, who served the company’s board for more than six years. He is set to leave the company at the end of the year, vacating the position of head of the remuneration committee. During his time as head, Esom helped Rank Group grow and was a valuable asset in developing the company’s remuneration policies.</p>
<p>Charles-Jones who will replace Esom is a well-suited person for the role thanks to her extensive experience in human resource and leadership roles. Her career spans over two decades in a half and has seen her work for many notable companies.</p>
<p>Her rich experience includes tenures at companies such as Vivendi, RAC, Threshers, Barclays Bank, Hays and LCJ Associates. In 2010, Charles-Jones had a short stint with AXA before moving on to Towergate where she worked as human resources director for three years. After that, the HR specialist returned to AXA for a longer term with the company.</p>
<p>Charles-Jones first joined Rank Group in June, first serving as a non-executive director. She will officially begin work as head of the company’s remuneration committee on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Chair Thursby Thanked Esom for His Hard Work</p>
<p>Alex Thursby, Rank Group’s chairman, spoke about Esom’s leave. The chair thanked the departing committee head for his exceptional work as a director on the board and chair of the remuneration committee, emphasizing that he did a lot to prepare the company for further expansion</p>
<p>Steven’s wealth of experience in consumer-focused industries, coupled with his long-standing strategic and shareholder experience, has had a strong influence on the board and helped lay the foundations for Rank’s future growth. Alex Thursby, chair, Rank Group</p>
<p>Thursby concluded that Esom played a key role in broadening the scope of the company’s remuneration policies. The chair thanked him for his service and wished him all the best.</p>
<p>After that, Thursby spoke about Charles-Jones who will be joining as head of the remuneration committee in 2023. He said that he is happy to have her on board and is looking forward to working with her.</p>
<p>I am delighted to have Lucinda step up as chair of the Remuneration Committee and as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, and the board looks forward to working with Lucinda in her new role. Alex Thursby, chair, Rank Group</p>
<p>In October, Rank Group published its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year. In the three months ended September 30, the company recorded an ever-so-slight increase in revenue. Rank Group preferred to remain cautiously optimistic, despite the slow start.</p>
