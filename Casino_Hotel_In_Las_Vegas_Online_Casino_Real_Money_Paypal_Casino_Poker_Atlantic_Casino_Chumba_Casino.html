<p>The platform allows local players to exclude themselves from all gambling activities in the state</p>
<p>New York has launched a self-exclusion program that allows players to get their gambling habits under control. Ushered in by the New York Responsible Play Partnership, the state-of-the-art program seeks to make problem gambling easier to address.</p>
<p>The Responsible Play Partnership is a joint venture of the NYS Gaming Commission, the New York Council on Problem Gambling and the State Office of Addiction Services and Support. All the bodies involved firmly believe that voluntary self-exclusion is an effective way to combat problem gambling and prevent gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>The platform allows local players to exclude themselves from gambling activities in the state by submitting a form either through mail or at a gambling establishment in the state. Operators that offer gaming or betting products to such players risk hefty fines.</p>
<p>The scheme now also offers a free support program that helps people identify problem gambling and find help. In addition, NY Council on Problem Gambling staff will be available at gambling facilities across the state to provide players with more information about the self-exclusion scheme and help them enroll. In addition, the council launched online services that help players fill in the form and send it remotely.</p>
<p>Prevention Is the Best Cure</p>
<p>James Maney, the council’s executive director, highlighted the importance of helping those in need. He said that the new program exemplifies his team’s care and concern for NY gamblers and will “break down barriers.”</p>
<p>Chinazo Cunningham, a commissioner at the State Office of Addiction Services and Support, also commented on the matter, underscoring the efficiency of voluntary self-exclusion as a prevention strategy. She added that it is also an opportunity for her team to connect to OASAS local problem gambling community support services and help them further mitigate harm.</p>
<p>A previous study by the office believes that roughly 4.4% of New York’s adult population is at risk of problem gambling, while 0.7% is already struggling with harm. With the recent launch of online sports betting and the upcoming launch of three new casinos, these numbers are likely to increase, urging the need to implement effective prevention measures.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the state is currently discussing the Adams Administration’s casino zoning plan that could pave the way for casino developments across broad sections of New York City.</p>
