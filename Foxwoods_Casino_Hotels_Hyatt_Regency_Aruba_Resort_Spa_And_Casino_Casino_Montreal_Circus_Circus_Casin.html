<p>Boyd Gaming Reveals New $500 Million Buyback Plan</p>

<p>The Orleans operator said its board of directors approved the buyback plan. The news arrived in conjunction with the declaration of the gaming company’s quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share. That will be paid on July 15 to shareholders of record as of June 15.</p>
<p>Considering the additional authorization, the company had approximately $633 million remaining in repurchase authority as of March 31, 2023,” according to a statement issued by the Las Vegas-based gaming operator.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, Boyd bought back approximately $106 million worth of its own shares. The company had $263.5 million in cash on hand as of March 31, confirming its balance sheet is among the tidiest in the regional gaming space.</p>
<p>Boyd Buyback Binge Continues</p>
<p>Boyd, which runs 28 gaming venues across 10 states, including 11 in its home city, is a dedicated buyer of its own stock.</p>
<p>Friday’s buyback announcement arrived 11 months after the Aliante operator revealed another $500 million repurchase plan. That followed the announcement of a $300 repurchase effort announced in October 2021. Boyd previously said it intends to buy back roughly $100 million of its shares per quarter.</p>
<p>Said another way, if no further buyback authorizations are added, by late 2024, the casino operator will have repurchased $1.3 billion worth of its shares. That’s a significant percentage of its current market capitalization of $6.93 billion. Boyd is displaying commitment to shareholder rewards — something of a rarity these days in the gaming industry — and some analysts believe that effort will be undaunted should a recession come to pass.</p>
<p>“We believe we would need to witness a recessionary environment way worse than what was witnessed in 2008/2009 before BYD would have to materially change their current capital return program,” wrote Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski in a note out last month.</p>
<p>Boyd Buying Back Undervalued Stock</p>
<p>Based on the $633 million in buyback power Boyd has, and its May 4 closing price of $68.16, the operator can repurchase 9.28 million of its shares, a significant percentage of its 105.53 million shares outstanding. The company may be getting a good deal because Wieczynski argued the stock is undervalued.</p>
<p>You have a company that has a massively underlevered balance sheet, strong core fundamentals, real estate optionality, and a call option around sports betting, yet trades at a discount to certain peers,” added the Stifel analyst.</p>
<p>The sports wagering optionality being referred to is Boyd’s 5% stake in FanDuel. That’s the largest online sportsbook operator in the US, boosting profits while adding market share.</p>
