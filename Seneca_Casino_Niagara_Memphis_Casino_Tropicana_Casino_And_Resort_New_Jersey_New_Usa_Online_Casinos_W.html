<p>Operating in the post-COVID-19 environment, off-track betting and sports betting venues in Japan and Singapore have reopened their doors for visitors.</p>
<p>More Off-Track Betting Shops Reopen in Japan</p>
<p>Japan and Singapore’s off-track betting shops keep reopening as the two countries are on track with relieving the strict measures introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since February 29, horse racing in Japan has kept going but only behind closed doors. The Japanese Racing Authority (JRA) keeps reopening off-track betting venues across the country. On July 11, Japan reopened 23 betting facilities.</p>
<p>In the following week, another six off-track betting venues reopened. Seven venues are planned to reopen on July 25. In addition, two more venues will reopen for customers on July 26. Although more off-track betting facilities reopen, the health and safety procedures remain strict.</p>
<p>The venues are allowed to operate with limited hours between 9 am and 2 pm. Furthermore, no live TV races or odds will be shown, but placing bets and cashing out winnings will be allowed. Given the limited working hours, some of the venues might not accept bets for some races.</p>
<p>Singapore Reopens Betting Shops Too</p>
<p>In Singapore, with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the country reopens more sports betting venues. The Pools’ Livewire properties reopened on Monday, July 20. The capacity of guests was limited to a maximum of 50 guests. However, the venues are featuring live sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>As a precaution, each venue operates under strict health and safety protocols in order to reduce a possible spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Keeping in mind the post-COVID-19 environment, visitors with chronic medical conditions or above the age of 60 were urged to avoid visiting the betting venues. Back in June, the Singapore’s online betting was reinstated along with lottery sales. Near the end of the month, on June 24, the 4D lottery returned as well.</p>
<p>Betting shops as well as the Pools’ Livewire properties were ordered shut back in March. This was an effort of the government to flatten the curve of COVID-19 spread. In April, more restrictions were introduced. The country announced the closing of “non-essential” businesses as well as schools. Affected by the additional restrictions was also the lottery as well as the online betting which resulted in the complete shutdown of country’s gaming industry.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Jockey Club recently announced a temporary shutdown of off-track betting venues, citing risks of rising COVID-19 cases in the special administrative region.</p>
