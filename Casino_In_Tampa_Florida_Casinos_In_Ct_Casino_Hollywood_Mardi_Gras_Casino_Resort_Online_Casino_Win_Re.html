    <h1>Casino In Tampa Florida Casinos In Ct Casino Hollywood Mardi Gras Casino Resort Online Casino Win Re</h1>

<p>With CasinoBeats now in progress, the event held between May 24 and May 26 at the InterContinental in St Julian’s in Malta has lived up to expectations. The hosts have made sure that CasinoBeats Summit 2022 will be remembered as one of the most worthwhile industry experiences of the year, offering as they put it, a deep dive into the current state of the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Much of this is achieved with the help of a great line of speakers, who are privy to the gambling industry and what it has to offer. Some of the experts that have already spoken, will speak or continue to be at the event include Alexander Martin (CEO, SKS365), Christopher Dalli (CEO, L&amp;L Europe), Adi Dhandhania (COO North America - Interactive, Bally’s Corporation), Thomas Rosander (CEO, Luckbox), David Flynn (CEO, Glitnor Group), Marie Theobald (Chief People Officer, Hero Gaming), and Arjan Korstjens (COO, Merkur Gaming).</p>
<p>More people you can meet on-site today and tomorrow include Matthias Ciappara (Head of Gaming Innovation, Entain), Josefine Hellström (Head of Casino, Casumo), Sílvia Meneses (Head of Casino, Solverde), Charlotte Camilleri (Head of SEO &amp; Content, Videoslots), Melanie Hainzer (CMO, Rootz), and Lee Beirne (Head of SEO, Ladbrokes Coral.</p>
<p>Commenting on the success of the meet-up, CasinoBeats Summit organizer SBC founder &amp; CEO Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity to have all these people in the same place and ensure that delegates will get a chance to study the industry up close. By bringing all of these prominent figures together, delegates have a real and unadulterated opportunity to get to know the industry in great detail, Sojmark argues.</p>
<p>He congratulated the organization as well and argued that the initial goals have been achieved, with the speakers now guiding the meeting and delivering their industry-rich experience throughout panels and discussions. But the above delegates are hardly the only experts in attendance. Others include Shelley Hannah (Director of Casino Products, Relax Gaming), Lara Falzon (President &amp; COO, Bragg Gaming Group), Tsachi Maimon (CEO, Aspire Global), and many other prominent names part of the ever-evolving gambling industry landscape.</p>
<p>The event will wrap up tomorrow evening at the Hilton Malta where the CasinoBeats Game Developer Awards will take place.</p>
