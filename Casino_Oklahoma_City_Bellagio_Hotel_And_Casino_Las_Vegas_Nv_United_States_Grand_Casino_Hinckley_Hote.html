    <h1>Casino Oklahoma City Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nv United States Grand Casino Hinckley Hote</h1>

<p>Dear casino.guru</p>
<p>I really need your help in resolving the situation with Lucky Star Casino. In my opinion, the casino has illegally canceled my winnings, referring to clause 16.23 of the Terms</p>
<p>"Players from Ukraine and Azerbaijan are not allowed to receive welcome promotion bonuses." I will explain everything in order.</p>
<p>Initially, when registering on the site, I in good faith indicated that I live in Ukraine (I attach a screenshot of the account). The casino was aware of this even before the game started. And the welcome bonus in the amount of 150% of the deposit was credited by the casino itself (I also attach a screen), I did not take any action for this.</p>
<p>Thus, the casino has taken a win-win position: if I lose, then Lucky Star Casino takes my money for itself; if I win, it will void my winnings. That is, the casino benefits in any case.</p>
<p>The casino reported an error pointing to clause 16.23 of the Terms only after I requested a withdrawal. If I had lost, I would not have received an error message. This is a popular trick among many casinos, I know about it. This generates additional income for the casino, but misleads the player.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the actions of the casino against me are not lawful.</p>
<p>Please help me get my $ 613 money.</p>
