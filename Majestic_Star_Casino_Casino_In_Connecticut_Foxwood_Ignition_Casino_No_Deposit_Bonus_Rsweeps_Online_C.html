    <h1>Majestic Star Casino Casino In Connecticut Foxwood Ignition Casino No Deposit Bonus Rsweeps Online C</h1>

<p>I am writing to you because there is a problem regarding a deposit on the website ivibet.com. I have been in contact with Ivibet.com customer service for three weeks but nothing is happening. I'm being held back and I have the feeling that they don't want to help me, even though I'm clearly in the right.</p>
<p>Information about the case:</p>
<p>I made a deposit of 500 euros using the Trustly payment method on www.ivibet.com on October 13th and 14th. Unfortunately the amount was not credited. However, my bank account was debited with 500 euros (see payment receipts attached).</p>
<p>According to Ivibet.com customer service, the 500 euros have not been received by you to date. This is a lie and I can prove it.</p>
<p>I was in contact with the payment service provider Trustly and they clearly assured me that the money had been received by Ivibet. I have attached the corresponding correspondence to you in this email.</p>
<p>My limit for instant transfers was exhausted, so the payment could not be made immediately on October 13th or October 14th. but with a time delay on October 16th. has been received by you. When payment was received, my player account was already blocked. I had it blocked on October 15th. As a result, the provider is currently in unlawful possession of the 500 euros. You received this money on October 16th. a. Since my player account was already blocked at this point, it could not have been used by me and should actually be available as credit.</p>
<p>The money is with Ivibet and they refuse to give it back to me. This is fraud and has criminal implications. According to the German Criminal Code ยง 263 StGB, this is fraud.</p>
<p>With Trustly's clear proof that the money was properly transferred to IviBet, I now urgently demand payment of the 500 euros. I will no longer accept any further delay.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Konstantin K****</p>
