<p>Johnny Manziel Pleads His Case to NFL Teams, Odds Favor Comeback</p>

<p>Johnny Manziel is one of the most famous figures in all of football despite throwing only seven touchdowns in his career.</p>

<p>The 2012 Heisman Trophy winner was released by the Cleveland Browns a year ago this month, but over the last 12 months, Johnny Football says he’s gotten his life back in order. That apparently includes slinging autographs and selfies for cash.</p>
<p>But the same agent that terminated him in 2016 has agreed to manage him once again, and oddsmakers now believe a resurgence is in store. After all, America likes few things more than a solid comeback.</p>
<p>MyBookie, an online sportsbook licensed out of Caribbean island of Curacao, is taking bets on Manziel’s future. Their offering reads, “What will happen first for Johnny Manziel in 2017?” “Arrested” posts at +180, while “Start an NFL game” is at -250.</p>
<p>The internet platform is under the impression that the former college star quarterback has indeed turned his life around, as starting a game is the favorite.</p>
<p>Manziel tweeted last month, “No lie. I was a douche in 2016. I’m trying to be a good PERSON again.” And appearing before a judge this week in relation to his domestic violence case with his former girlfriend in early 2016, Manziel said, “My life is trending upward.”</p>
<p>Bet or Bust</p>
<p>As is always the case during each NFL offseason, a slew of teams are looking to improve their most important position. Quarterbacks are hot commodities, and Manziel’s former team knows that more than any franchise in the league.</p>
<p>The Browns have started an astonishing 26 different quarterbacks since 2000.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Dawg Pound tried another former Heisman winner, Robert Griffin III. Cleveland lost RG III during the first regular season game due to a shoulder injury, and the Browns ended up going 1-15 on the year.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook predicts the Browns to once again be the worst team in the NFL next fall, with their odds at 300-1 to win Super Bowl LIII. Cleveland is once again looking for a long-term quarterback, but the team doesn’t appear to be willing to give Manziel another shot.</p>
<p>Potential Suitors</p>
<p>A host of teams are reportedly looking at Manziel, though none are currently publicly confirming such interest. A Manziel signing wouldn’t be popular in too many cities, save for perhaps Houston or Dallas, the same state where Johnny remains a near legend.</p>
<p>The Texans went all-in last season on quarterback Brock Osweiler. While the team made the playoffs, the franchise player underperformed by most expectations, and having a viable replacement in Manziel might be attractive to coach Bill O’Brien.</p>
<p>The former Texas A&amp;M star is also a potential solid pickup for the Cowboys. Though they struck gold last year with Dak Prescott, and Tony Romo still remains on the roster, owner Jerry Jones is a fan of Manziel and might believe putting the 24-year-old under Romo’s veteran wing could pay future dividends.</p>
<p>But for the time being, it doesn’t seem as if any teams are ready to bet on Johnny Manziel. He’ll continue trying to tip the odds in his favor.</p>
