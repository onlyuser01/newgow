<p>Big Bucks Bandits, Yggdrasil and ReelPlay’s latest Megaways slot title, features a thrilling Wild West adventure developed with YG Masters.</p>
<p>117,649 Ways to Win</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and ReelPlay just announced the release of Big Bucks Bandits Megaways, their new action-packed slot game set in the Wild West. The leading iGaming operator’s new title was developed by studio partner ReelPlay via the YG Masters program and offers players a rip-roaring gunslinging adventure in pursuing bounties.</p>
<p>With 117,649 different ways to win and prizes of up to 10,000 times the original bet, Big Bucks Bandits uses the Megaways innovative mechanic, which brings a random reel modifier.</p>
<p>Various features allow players to multiply their chances to win as well as the size of their winnings. The Double Cross Gamble will give slot fans the opportunity to wager their prizes to increase their total winnings by up to five times. Players can immediately withdraw their winnings or take a gamble and move on to the next multiplier.</p>
<p>Triggered with six or more scatter symbols, the Jackpot Heist Respin rewards players with three additional spins. New symbols will remain on the reels, while the respin count will be reset. Once the spins are all spent, each symbol held until there will grant users with jackpots and prizes.</p>
<p>On top of those exciting features, the game features the Trophy Jackpots, which offers different jackpot levels, such as the Platinum pot which multiplies the original bet by 1,000.</p>
<p>Another Successful Title for Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Big Bucks Bandits Megaways follows the release of another gunslinging-inspired slot, iSoftBet’s Bounty Belles, released earlier this month. This is Reel Play’s third game created via Yggdrasil’s program YG Masters, after Atlantis Megaways in December 2020, and Giza Infinity Reels launched at the beginning of February.</p>
<p>The operator’s proprietary GATI technology was once again used to build the game. It aims to help developers in the creation and release phases by providing standardized, regulation ready tools to bring out the best innovative gaming content. Furthermore, GATI offers quick deployment and communication over Yggdrasil’s network, giving YG Masters partners the possibility quickly expand their growth startegies around the world.</p>
<p>The operator’s Head of Partner Programs, Stuart McCarthy, commended this new addition to Yggdrasil’s vast portfolio, and declared that Big Bucks Bandits offers “refined game features and massive win potential”. The game is dedicated to players “who are willing to take risks for a larger reward,” he added.</p>
<p>ReelPlay’s Chief Commercial Officer David Johnson noted the integration of the “enhanced Jackpot Respins mechanic” which has been a hit at land-based gambling locations, as well as the Megaways feature which “has taken the online industry by storm”.</p>
