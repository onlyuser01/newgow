    <h1>Cachuma Casino Fitzgeralds Casino Isle Casino Eva Green Casino Royale M Resort Spa Casino CT Interac</h1>

<p>The provider of online casino games, powering gambling operators around the globe, CT Interactive, confirmed a new deal, allowing it to significantly expand the reach of its popular portfolio. The company boosted its European presence by joining forces with Grand Casino Baden's brand, jackpot.ch, a leading operator in Switzerland. Announced earlier this week, the deal will see customers of the operator gain access to leading games provided by CT Interactive.</p>
<p>Judging by a statement released by the iGaming content provider, the integration of its portfolio with jackpot.ch will be completed through Gamanza's platform. The latest collaboration represents a major step for CT Interactive as it enables the company to expand its reach in Europe and Switzerland in particular.</p>
<p>Silvia Hristova, CT Interactive's Head of CRM, was delighted about the new collaboration in Switzerland. "We are thrilled to bring our exciting games to the Swiss players also through this exciting partnership," she explained in a statement released by the company.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hristova pointed out: "Switzerland has shown tremendous potential in the online gambling sector, and we are confident that our high-quality gaming content will resonate with the operators' end clients in the region." Finally, CT Interactive's Head of CRM explained: "We look forward to a successful collaboration with our esteemed operator partner and delivering exceptional gaming experiences to Swiss players."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration with jackpot.ch, customers in Switzerland will benefit from CT Interactive's innovative casino games that are developed to appeal to local audiences. The new content deal will help elevate the Swiss brand and expand its offering, while at the same time, increasing the reach of the iGaming developer's content.</p>
<p>The expansion of CT Interactive in Switzerland comes as no surprise, considering the strong potential of the country's regulated gambling market. The European country legalized online gambling activities back in 2019, allowing the expansion of its iGaming market. Now, the new deal is expected to bring benefits not only for CT Interactive but for jackpot.ch as well.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, CT Interactive once again expanded the reach of its games. At the time, the company joined forces with Sazka – Allwyn International. Under the deal, the iGaming content developer agreed to supply an exclusive portion of its portfolio to the operator. Thanks to that content agreement, Sazka – Allwyn International's customers were able to access fan-favorite games from CT Interactive, such as Coffee Magic, HOT 7's X 2, Fortune Pig and Mystic Moon, among others.</p>
