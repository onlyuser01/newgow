<p>Zeus review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The mightiest God on Olympus was Zeus, King of the Gods and Lord of Thunder. Mythology, with its recognisable iconography, always makes for a good slot theme.</p>
<p>That is what Habanero’s Zeus slot works with. Here, Zeus is accompanied by his wife Hera, and a range of generic Ancient Greek artefacts – shields, busts, and pottery for the most part though with plenty of Ace to Ten symbols written in a pseudo-greek angular script.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics and animations are certainly solid. The animations are smooth and slick.</p>
<p>Example of 5 of a kind win in Habanero's slot Zeus</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the actual designs for the slot do not match up to the technical competence. The pictures are bland and uninteresting. The whole slot lacks much sense of character, that can make other slots from Habanero so engaging.</p>
<p>The sound effects make no effort to be in keeping with the theme and are more or less bog-standard slot machine noises.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The main game is a typical 5x3 slot machine, with 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 win-lines as per your choice as a player.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game has a free spin bonus and almost no other features.</p>
<p>As a result, the gameplay is not the most engaging. This would be forgivable in a slot that had a little more charm.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The game has just two special symbols.</p>
<p>There is a Wild symbol on which is painted the titular Zeus. It plays as a typical wild symbol substituting for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. When you hit a winning combo with him he animates in a drab way.</p>
<p>Explanation of bonus game rules in Zeus slot</p>
<p>The main perk of the Wild symbol is that if you hit a win-line with multiple Wild symbols, the payout can be huge – 15 times your bet per line for two, 150 for three, 1500 for four and a whopping 15,000 for five on one win-line.</p>
<p>The other symbol is a Scatter symbol which pays out whenever you hit two or more. The payouts for this are rather lower than the wild (hit five and you win just 200 times your bet, hit four and you win just 5 times your bet).</p>
<p>If you hit three or more Scatter symbols you also trigger the free spins. This is where the big wins are made. You win 5, 15 or 50 spins depending on if you get three, four or five scatters. Although you cannot retrigger the feature, every time you hit a scatter during the free spins you gain +1 free spin.</p>
<p>During the free spins, all the payouts are also tripled.</p>
<p>There is also a jackpot feature which triggers at random. 0.45% of each bet is split between three differently sized jackpots. The more you contribute to a jackpot the better your odds of triggering it.</p>
<p>Balance rises considerably when you catch a progressive jackpot win in Zeus slot from Habanero</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The RTP of the game is just 96.03%, this is very vanilla, and more or less what you would expect of something that is so average it hurts.</p>
<p>The variance is also pretty mid-range. Though this can be adjusted by playing a different number of lines with the same total bet.</p>
<p>Which is good, because bet controls allow you to tailor all that very easily. You can almost bet any amount between the maximum of £/€/$250.00 per spin and minimum of £/€/$0.01 per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable of Habanero's Zeus slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Habanero’s Zeus slot machine is a thoroughly undistinctive and unremarkable slot.</p>
<p>Very little stands out about it from the beige design, copy-pasted artworks and the lack of soundtrack.</p>
<p>Even the volatility and RTP are middle of the road. We would not recommend this slot to anyone who is trying to stay awake while they play.</p>
