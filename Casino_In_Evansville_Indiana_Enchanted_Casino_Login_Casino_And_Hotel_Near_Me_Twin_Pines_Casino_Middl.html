<p>Despite losing five straight games, the Miami Dolphins still have a shot at the AFC Wild Card by beating the New York Jets on Sunday</p>
<p>Both teams are 0-5 in their previous five games, but the Miami Dolphins have a slightly better record (8-8) than the New York Jets (7-9). They got only one win more but that still gives them a chance to make the playoffs. The Jets, on the other hand, stand no chance to qualify for the postseason.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s clear that it’s Miami that’s going to be fired up in Sunday’s game. The trouble, however, is that the Dolphins will miss a number of key men in Week 18.</p>

<p>Hopeless Jets to Miss Out the Playoffs for 12Th Straight Seasons</p>
<p>The New York Jets are 7-9 on the season but it’s been a while since they won a game the last time. In fact, they’re 0-5 in their previous five, with their most recent win happening in Week 12 against the Chicago Bears, who are currently the second-worst team in the NFL with a 3-13 record.</p>
<p>The Jets’ win drought is even longer when it comes to away games. The last time they won on the road was in Week 7 against the Denver Broncos. Speaking of NY’s away performances, the Jets have all losses in their previous six trips to Miami Gardens.</p>
<p>QB Troubles for the Dolphins</p>
<p>With an 8-8 record, the Miami Dolphins still have a chance to win the AFC Wild Card. For that to happen, they need to beat the Jets. Unfortunately for their fans, doing it won’t be easy. They’re in horrible form, but the real problem ahead of Week 18 is that they have serious problems with injuries.</p>
<p>Miami’s starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is out with a concussion, while backup QB Teddy Bridgewater is reportedly hurting with a finger injury. What this means is that the Dolphins’ signal-caller in Week 18 is going to be either unfit Bridgewater or third-string QB Skylar Thompson. Either way, we don’t expect a lot from Miami’s passing game.</p>
<p>New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>Miami’s injury problems are serious, but there are a few good things going their way in Week 18. First of all, they’re taking on an unmotivated opponent who won’t get anything if they win on Sunday. Secondly, the game is played on the Dolphins’ turf where they’re 5-2 this season. With the help of their fans, they should be able to labor a win.</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Dolphins to win; under to hit</p>
