<p>Brad Rutter is the early betting favorite to win the “Jeopardy! Greatest of All Time” competition against Ken Jennings and Las Vegas sports bettor James Holzhauer.</p>

<p>The best-of-seven showdown will begin January 7 in primetime on ABC (8-9 pm ET). The first person to win three games will be declared the game show’s “Greatest of All Time,” and take home $1 million. The two non-winners will each receive $250,000.</p>
<p>“Based on their previous performances, these three are already the ‘greatest.’ But you can’t help wondering: Who is the best of the best?” host Alex Trebek pondered.</p>
<p>Jennings won 74 games and winnings of $3,370,700. Holzhauer won $2,712,216 during his 32-game winning streak.</p>
<p>No one has won more money on Jeopardy! than Rutter, whose haul from the show is $4,688,436. He’s never lost to a human opponent, as the show had appearance caps at the time of his 2000 run.</p>
<p>Rutter Bets</p>
<p>Online bookmaker Bovada was quick to offer odds up on the Jeopardy! showdown. But that might come back to haunt the sportsbook. The initial odds were Holzhauer +110, Jennings +115, and Rutter a distant +280, the latter attractive to many.</p>
<p>I think James will win, but those disrespectful odds for Brad Rutter make me want to throw a few bucks down,” one tweet read. Another: “+280 is great odds for someone who is top earner in Jeopardy history who also happens to be undefeated.”</p>
<p>However, Holzhauer played most recently, and has a slight age advantage. Holzhauer is 35, Rutter 41, and Jennings 45.</p>
<p>“I think that Ken and Brad are going to be at a slight disadvantage,” Trebek opined. “They won the majority of their monies 10, 15 years ago, so they’ve aged a bit. And are their reflexes going to be as good as James Holzhauer’s? Who knows?”</p>
<p>“But we’re going to find out in this tournament. It’s going to be a blast, we’re all excited about it,” the 79-year-old said.</p>
<p>Current Odds</p>
<p>The early action has been on Rutter, which has led to Bovada shortening his odds of being deemed the “greatest.”</p>
<p>The line now stands at Rutter and Holzhauer +140, and Jennings the underdog at +180. The odds imply winning chances of 41.67 percent and 35.71 percent. A $100 bet respectively nets $140 and $180.</p>
<p>BetOnline has Holzhauer the heavy favorite at -200. Rutter is next at +175, and Jennings longer at +225.</p>
<p>The trash-talking is already underway. Jennings never won the Tournament of Champions, as he gave up his entry for a place in the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions. He finished second to winner Rutter.</p>
<p>“This January, watch two Tournament of Champions winners take on a third player brought in to fill out the lineup,” Holzhauer jokingly tweeted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rutter paid tribute to Trebek, who remains battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer. In an ad showing the Jeopardy! host above the three “greatest” contestants, Rutter tweeted, “Srsly tho everybody knows the real @Jeopardy GOAT is the guy in the top half of the frame.”</p>
