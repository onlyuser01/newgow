<p>Georges St-Pierre Slimming Down for McGregor Fight? Ex-Champ Addresses Rampant Rumors</p>

<p>Mixed martial arts legend Georges St-Pierre (GSP) is for the first time addressing rumors that he could face the winner of the upcoming fight between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>

<p>The former UFC champion in both the welterweight and middleweight divisions hasn’t been seen in the Octagon since UFC 217 in Montreal last November.</p>
<p>It was his first fight in four years, and after defeating middleweight champion Michael Bipsing, he quickly gave up the belt and went into another mini-retirement.</p>
<p>However, the Canadian hasn’t ruled out a return to the ring, leaving one big question to be answered — who would he face?</p>
<p>Speculation surfaced this week that GSP was once again getting ready to rumble after he posted a picture on Twitter in which he was looking rather slim.</p>

<p>That caused quite the stir, with many suggesting he was preparing for a fight at 155 pounds.</p>
<p>“Champ, you’re looking relatively small,” responded one fan. “Allow me to speculate that you’re planning to fight the winner of Conor vs Khabib.”</p>
<p>McGregor and Nurmagomedov will fight at 155 pounds for the welterweight belt at UFC 229 in early October.</p>
<p>Will he or Won’t He?</p>
<p>While the fight would surely be one of the biggest UFC pay-per-view draws of all time, the former champ is throwing a bit of cold water on the idea.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I was going to do it,” St-Pierre told reporters at a public appearance promoting his aquatic training company this week. “People headlined me the wrong way, to sell articles. That’s the society we live in.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he didn’t rule out a return to the ring altogether. In fact, he was perfectly blunt about his desire to build on the GSP legend.</p>
<p>“I want to come back for a good fight,” St-Pierre said. “I want to come back for a fight that I can win, that I can gain something in terms of legacy. Not only money, but in terms of legacy. Because I have a lot more to lose than to win.”</p>
<p>A McGregor-GSP tilt would potentially be the most-hyped fight in UFC history. However, UFC president Dana White said this summer that he’s “not interested in that fight.”</p>

<p>At this point, White is more focused on the upcoming super fight between the loquacious McGregor and the undefeated Nurmagomedov, which will take place on October 6 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Despite being a huge favorite with the public, the trash-talking Irishman, who recently ducked serious jail time, is a pretty big underdog in the fight.</p>
<p>McGregor is listed at 7/5 to defeat the Russian, meaning a $100 dollar bet would net you a profit of $140.</p>
<p>Nurmagomedov has yet to lose and is generally considered the most dangerous pound-for-pound fighter in the world. At odds of 10/17, you’d have to risk $170 on “The Eagle” to make a $100 profit.</p>
