<p>Red Tiger Games Go Live in PA with BetMGM and Borgata</p>
<p>Supplier of online games Red Tiger expanded its presence in Pennsylvania after launches with BetMGM Casino and Borgata Casino announced today.</p>
<p>Top Quality Games</p>
<p>Under the deals with BetMGM Casino and Borgata Casino, Red Tiger already deployed three games from its rich portfolio of casino games, Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, Cash Volt and Wings of Ra, and more game titles are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“Red Tiger delivers top-quality games to licensed markets around the world. BetMGM is delighted to add their popular titles to our world-class games portfolio.” Matthew Sunderland, VP, Gaming, BetMGM</p>
<p>Red Tiger debuted in the Keystone State in November 2020 in partnership with Rush Street Interactive (RSI), initially launching the same three player-favorite titles across RSI’s BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com gaming brands.</p>
<p>The launch for the casino games supplier with BetMGM Casino and Borgata Casino followed the integration of live casino games and slot titles provided by NetEnt into the Evolution gaming platform across several US jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Evolution Expands PA Presence</p>
<p>Evolution acquired the Swedish-based slot developer NetEnt AB in a £1.68 billion deal in the summer of 2020 but the deal could not complete until the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK approved the deal in November.</p>
<p>NetEnt acquired casino games supplier Red Tiger Gaming in September 2019 in an all-cash deal of £220 million to further consolidate its position in the iGaming space.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see Red Tiger go live with BetMGM and look forward to extending our partnership with them. The studio is producing very successful games and I’m sure they will be well-received by players.” Jeff Millar, Commercial Director, North America, Evolution</p>
<p>Red Tiger expanded its iGaming presence in Pennsylvania following another month of stable performance for online casino games in the state, unlike sports betting which confirmed in April the tendency of slowing down started in February.</p>
<p>On sequential basis, online casino wagers in April increased by 128%, reaching $3.2 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in the previous month, delivering $25.5 million in state taxes and $13.1 million in local share assessments and county grants.</p>
<p>Red Tiger parent Evolution, in partnership with The Cordish Gaming Group, deployed its live first-person and show-style games across the company’s Play!Live online gaming brand to offer players in the Keystone State an unrivalled experience from its dedicated studio gaming content.</p>
