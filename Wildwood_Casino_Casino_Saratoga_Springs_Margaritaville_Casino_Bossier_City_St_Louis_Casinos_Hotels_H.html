<p>Having joined the FSB family in the summer of 2020 on a client-focused position as head of marketing operations, Chris Graham will be taking over the reins of the same provider’s Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing team.</p>
<p>According to the requirements of his new position, Graham will lead the provider’s marketing strategies across Europe, Latin America, North America, and Africa. As a former manager for Sportingbet, Catena Media, and Ladbrokes, Graham will use his rich expertise to further strengthen FSB’s global marketing efforts and expansion.</p>
<p>Why Graham Is the Best Person for FSB</p>
<p>Founded in London in 2009, FSB is an award-winning iGaming and sports betting platform company at the forefront of innovation. With a remarkable reach in four continents and an honorable SBC Sportsbook Supplier Of The Year award, the company provides a rich variety of comprehensive modular platforms, full-service mobile and retail sports betting solutions, customer support, trading, marketing, and hosting services.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the state-of-the-art company has continued its growth and expansion in new markets. Chris Graham’s recent appointment as senior head of B2B marketing is just one of the latest strategic moves that will ensure more growth at a global level.</p>
<p>Graham is already accustomed to the company’s strategies and goals, and his new leadership role will allow the company to benefit as well. His dynamic mix of Tier 1 Business-to-Consumer experience and powerful B2B marketing skills will successfully bring more depth to FSB’s business development crew.</p>
<p>Graham will be directly responsible for beefing up the brand’s global awareness while generating more leads and showing support for the continuously developing business development team across all four continents where FSB is currently present.</p>
<p>Graham’s appointment is the third important appointment the supplier has completed in the past few months. Kyle Brady was named the new pre-sales engineer in January, while Andrew Grimshaw was appointed the new business development director for UK and Europe last December.</p>
<p>FSB Recorded an Exponential Growth During the Last Year</p>
<p>FSB’s chief revenue officer Ian Freeman called the last year a transformative one with a lot of growth that is now forcing the company to build a larger team of skilled and dedicated experts. The new team should be prepared to drive its international corporate marketing strategies, especially in the newly opened sports wagering retail shop network in South Dakota and its fresh headquarter in Central London.</p>
<p>FSB’s potential has never been greater and Graham is ready to build on the momentum and keep pushing their curated sports betting and unique online gaming experiences to big operators worldwide.</p>
