    <h1>Ocean Resort Casino Casino In Scottsdale Casino Seattle Barina Casino Yellow Brick Road Casino Uptow</h1>

<p>I am a very loyal long term player here at Uptown Aces and I deposit a lot of money here. I play more than the average person. On Dec, 2 2022 I took a 3 part coupon. Elasticxmas 1,2 3,. I started with Elasticxmas-1 and made a deposit. I played this coupon and lost. Then I activated Elasticxmas-2 made another deposit played thru my play thru and ended up with $6000 in my account. I couldn't make a withdrawal because they only allow $1000 per week or every 9 days and I had a previous win that I just got my last payment on. I stopped playing and later that day around 4:30 pm and logged in and noticed that I didn't play part 3 of the same coupon. Here is where I believe there is a glitch with the RTG software. There was $6000 in my account. The part 3 of the original coupon was still available so without thinking I clicked on it and it redeemed. I played it and won 200 more dollars. By right all other coupons will not activate if you have a balance in your account. This one activated. After waiting close to the 7 days before I can make my first withdrawal I played some money back about $1200. so my balance went down to $4800. Last Thursday was the 7th day and I initiated a withdrawal of $1000 the limit they allow. Then it went under review for 2 days. Yesterday I received an email that my withdrawal of $470 was completed and since I played a coupon with a balance in my account all other monies in my account were removed and deleted as per casinos terms and conditions. I clicked on this coupon because I didn't think it would hurt me because it was the completion of the 3 parts. I know the rules of RTG platforms and I do not try in any way to bend the rules. I have been playing RTG games and others for over 6 years online. I contacted chat service and they said your max cash out of the Elasticxmas-3 is 500 max. I replied and told them I won The $6000 on Elasticxmas-2 not 3. The money was in my account before the 3rd coupon activated where it shouldn't have activated. If you have monies in your account prior to any redemption or activation IT WILL NOT ACTIVATE. YOU MUST ACTIVATE THE COUPON BEFORE DEPOSITING. In this case there is a glitch with their software allowing this 3rd coupon to activate with a balance in the account. I chatted back and fourth with Allie and got nowhere. I have copies of my account balances before and after the 3rd redemption. This is how a long term very very loyal player is treated. I have deposited on average over 1500 per month to the point where they limited me on game play. So loyalty doesn't matter. They know the 3rd coupon should never of activated. The 3rd coupon should have disappeared when the 2nd coupon was completed and there was a large balance in my account.</p>
