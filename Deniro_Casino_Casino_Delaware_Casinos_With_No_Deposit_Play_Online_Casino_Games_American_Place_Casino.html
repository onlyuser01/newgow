    <h1>Deniro Casino Casino Delaware Casinos With No Deposit Play Online Casino Games American Place Casino</h1>

<p>Global sports betting operator Tipico and the largest display screen network in restaurants and bars across the US, TVM DOOH, entered into an agreement that will see Tipico odds and branded marketing content integrated into hundreds of screens across bars in Colorado and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Targeting Audiences in a Unique Way</p>
<p>The partnership deal that will showcase Tipico’s odds from the NFL and many other sports and will feature operator’s propositions across all markets ranging from moneyline and spread, to player props, boosted odds, and real-time promotions, will have an exclusivity clause in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with TVM DOOH to reach sports fans in two important markets for our brand. Real-time sports data and premium betting insights are at the core of our proprietary mobile sports betting product, and this partnership with TVM opens up a highly engaging channel to showcase our odds experience to future Tipico players.” Keith Gormley, VP, Marketing, Tipico US</p>
<p>The deal with TVM DOOH will allow Tipico to fully utilize the market segmentation of the display screen network’s audience targeting viewers and sports fans in New Jersey and Colorado in a way that has not been done before to further strengthen its market position in both US gaming jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agreement, TVM DOOH chief commercial officer Pedram Danesh outlined the purpose of the deal with Tipico is to “elevate the sports bar experience”, offering live odds and exciting offers for the viewers.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen Tipico grow in the New Jersey market, and we’re excited to help strengthen their brand position and launch in new regions like Colorado by digitally activating bar patrons. We expect a high level of audience engagement during the partnership, and we are excited to announce additional innovations throughout the football season.” Pedram Danesh, CCO, TVM DOOH</p>
<p>Tipico’s US Presence</p>
<p>Malta-based operator Tipico entered the sports betting market in the Garden State in December last year, following a conditional approval by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and a soft-launch in October, rolling out its proprietary sportsbook app, powered by official data from Sportradar.</p>
<p>Tipico expanded into Colorado last month after approval for the launch of its sportsbook app was granted by the Colorado Division of Gaming. Tipico entered into a strategic collaboration with land-based casino operator Century Casinos to obtain regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Tipico’s presence in the Centennial State is set to further expand after the global betting operator selected Denver to house its new technology hub that will bring more than 400 highly paid jobs. So far, Tipico’s headcount in the US is limited to the office personnel of 42 in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>
