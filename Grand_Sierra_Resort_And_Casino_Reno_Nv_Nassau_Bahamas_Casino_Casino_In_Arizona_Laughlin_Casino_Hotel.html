<p>Chip Spin review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Chip Spin has a playful Las Vegas theme.</p>
<p>Players will rock up to the Vegas strip where they’ll immediately see iconic sites like the replica of the Eiffel tower and another replica of an Egyptian pyramid. A cast of curious characters will meet them on the reels and test their luck in the city of sin.</p>
<p>This game will be right up the alley of players who enjoy destination slots and a little bit of an exotic escape.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a jaunty vintage tune that will make players feel as if they are being welcomed into town. The optimistic melody is occasionally mixed with the sounds of the city for an immersive effect.</p>
<p>The symbols include an eccentric cast of characters, such as a cigar smoking hustler, and a sly woman with gleaming earrings. They are animated in a style that brings to mind a children’s cartoon film, with defining features exaggerated.</p>
<p>Players will also find a variety of gems on the reels rendered in vibrant shades of green, pink, and red.</p>
<p>A cartoon Las Vegas sprawls behind the reels with a bright blue sky and sunshine above. In the light of day, it seems to be a playground waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music combine to create a relatively wholesome Vegas fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Chip Spin is a five reel, five row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded to players for landing matching symbols connected in adjacent reels starting from the leftmost reel. Combinations must include at least three matching symbols. In total, this creates 259 ways to win.</p>
<p>Players have the option to buy directly into the bonus features (see more details of these below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>When players land 3 or more Bonus symbols, this triggers the Free Spins feature. Players begin with 8 free spins when they land 3 Bonus symbols, and any additional Bonus symbols increase the number of free spins by +2.</p>
<p>For the Free Spins feature, Chip symbols provide different bonuses depending on their colour. They may award extra spins, add multipliers, or transform into Sticky Wilds.</p>
<p>Should players land 5 or more Chip symbols of any type, a Chip Spin Bonus game will begin. This feature uses special reels which are made up of blank squares or various Chip symbols. Chip symbols are sticky, remaining on the reels, and have different properties depending on their colour.</p>
<p>Players begin with one life. A life is lost every Chip Spin that doesn’t result in another Chip landing. Landing particular kinds of chips can earn the player additional lives.</p>
<p>If a reel is filled with symbols during the Chip Spin Bonus game, all the green symbols will merge, combining their values into one symbol. This creates more positions for new symbols to land in.</p>
<p>The maximum win during the Bonus games is x25,000 the total bet. Should players reach this amount, the bonus game ends and players collect their winnings.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.41%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€40.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Las Vegas-themed slot.</p>
<p>With solid RTP and strategy-ready high volatility, Chip Spin is a savvy choice for players looking to maximise their wins.</p>
<p>The light-hearted Las Vegas theme keeps things fun and will definitely put players in the right frame of mind to play.</p>
