<p>West Ham vs. Olympiacos is one of the most interesting duels of the next phase of the 2023-24 Europa League. The game is played on Thursday, November 9, at London Stadium</p>
<p>West Ham is sitting top of the group table with six points. Thatâ€™s the same number as second-placed Freiburg, but the Hammers are higher in the standings thanks to beating the German side a month ago. Olympiacos Piraeus is trailing behind those two with four points, while TSC is sitting at the bottom with just one point won in the game with the Greek heavyweight.</p>
<p>What all this means is that the future is unwritten for all the teams in Group A of the 2023-24 Europa League. Each of them still stands a chance of advancing to the knockout stage of this tournament.</p>

<p>The Hammers are Doing Very Well on Home Turf</p>
<p>West Ham has been great on home turf in the 2023-24 season, winning four of the seven competitive matches played since the start of the new campaign.</p>
<p>Some of those wins were over real heavyweights. For instance, in their first home game in the Prem, they defeated Chelsea 3-1. Even more impressively, they destroyed Arsenal in the EFL Cup in their most recent game at London Stadium.</p>

<p>In the 2023-24 Europa League, theyâ€™ve played just one game at home. It was against TSC, which they won 3-1. Now, theyâ€™re facing a much tougher opponent, but their odds suggest they might do alright on Thursday. The Hammers are seen as -149 favorites against Greeceâ€™s most decorated soccer club.</p>
<p>Olympiacos Players Love Big Games</p>
<p>Olympiacos Piraeus is a team that often shows up in big games. A good example of this is that in their first duel with West Ham, they defeated the Hammers 2-1. However, this Europa League game was played in Greece.</p>
<p>On their turf, Olympiacos players are usually great, but on the road, they are known to underperform. Theyâ€™re undefeated on the road this season, but thereâ€™s a caveat.</p>
<p>Their superb away run doesnâ€™t mean anything given that most of the away games theyâ€™ve played so far in the 2023-24 campaign were in the Greek Super League, which just isnâ€™t a tough competition. In the Europa League, theyâ€™ve played one game on the road, drawing 2-2 with TSC.</p>
<p>West Ham vs. Olympiacos Prediction</p>
<p>The West Ham vs. Olympiacos odds suggest the Hammers are going to win, and thereâ€™s a good reason for that. Actually, there are two reasons â€“ West Ham has the manpower as well as their fans to support them to another win in the Europa League.</p>
<p>Pick: West Ham to win</p>
