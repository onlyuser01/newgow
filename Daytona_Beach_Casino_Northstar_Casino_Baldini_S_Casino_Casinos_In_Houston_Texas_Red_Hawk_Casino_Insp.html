<p>The popular provider of business-to-business (B2B) gaming content, solutions and systems, Inspired Entertainment, expanded further its presence in the United States upon announcing a new partnership. The company confirmed Monday it joined forces with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino, boosting its presence in the regulated gambling market in the US.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new deal, Inspired agreed to provide the leading operator with its iGaming content. The deal applies to Pennsylvania and will help expand the offering of Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino. At the same time, the new collaboration helps Inspired's popular content reach new customers.</p>
<p>In a statement released on April 3, 2023, Caesars Digital's Senior Vice President of iGaming, Matthew Sunderland, commented saying: "We are very excited to partner with the Inspired team to provide players with best-in-class iGaming content in Pennsylvania, one of the largest iGaming states in North America."</p>
<p>Finally, he explained: "Our key focus is delivering players the best titles on our iGaming platform, and we're proud to work with Inspired to elevate our iGaming platform in this important market."</p>
<p>The new deal in Pennsylvania comes on the heels of another collaboration announced by Caesars in the state. Late last month, the company confirmed it introduced content for its customers in Pennsylvania from White Hat Studios, a popular provider of iGaming content. As a result, award-winning games from the provider became available for Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino customers in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Before that, Caesars signed a similar partnership with Pariplay in Ontario, Canada. Announced in mid-March, the deal saw Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino tap into the excellent range of popular and engaging games provided by Pariplay. This helped expand the offering and position of the operator on the market, while at the same time boosting the reach of Pariplay's content.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest deal in Pennsylvania, Inspired's President and Chief Executive Officer, Brooks Pierce, said: "We are thrilled to partner with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino to deliver premium iGaming content to its players in Pennsylvania." He explained that the new collaboration complements the positive momentum gained by Inspired with its partners in strategic markets such as Michigan and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pierce noted that the company is delighted to extend the reach of its player-favorite themes such as Big Bonus, Big Spin Bonus, Big Fishing Fortune, as well as Gold Cash Free Spins to Caesars' growing customer base. Last but not least, he noted: "It is a pleasure to work with the Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino team, and we congratulate them on this exciting launch."</p>
