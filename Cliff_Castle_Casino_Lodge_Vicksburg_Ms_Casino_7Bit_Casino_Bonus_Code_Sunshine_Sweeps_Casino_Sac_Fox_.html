    <h1>Cliff Castle Casino Lodge Vicksburg Ms Casino 7Bit Casino Bonus Code Sunshine Sweeps Casino Sac Fox</h1>

<p>Dear YarPrixodon,</p>
<p>Please be informed that we managed to get in touch with the casino team and received an explanation for this issue. It seems there was a slight misunderstanding.</p>
<p>According to the information provided by the casino team, it appears that the issue was in no way related to a breach of Bonus Terms. The casino decided to conduct an additional verification procedure, regarding which a representative of the casino reached you via phone. After providing all requested documentation, you passed the verification process. The casino team did not register any inquiries from your side at this point, but apparently, you were in belief that your gaming account was about to be blocked (based on the e-mail you received on April 24, 2023, 6:34 PM I assume) and played your remaining balance down to zero. I understand you indicated this in your initial message but due to an error in translation, this information was missed on my part.</p>
<p>The following day, as a gesture of goodwill, the casino decided to credit you with a free bonus in the form of 1000 free spins, and from that day, as far as the casino team is aware, you continued playing without submitting any further complaints to the casino’s customer support. That’s the story from the casino’s point of view.</p>
<p>I understand your point of view, but since you have played your winnings down to zero, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do. There simply are no funds left to recover. For future reference, in situations like this, I strongly recommend staying patient and refraining from further play at least until the situation has been clarified.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, considering the circumstances, if there are no facts that have been left out of</p>
<p>consideration, we are left with no option but to reject your complaint.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any remarks.</p>
