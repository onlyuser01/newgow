    <h1>12 Tribes Casino And Hotel Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino Double Down Casino Casino Night Zone Ca</h1>

<p>As the old saying goes, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. The NFL was one of several sports leagues that helped push the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) into law, but it is now creating a new playbook after the US Supreme Court shot down the legislation in 2018. No longer campaigning against sports gambling, the NFL is teaming up with a number of operators to introduce more sports gambling coverage in the league.</p>
<p>NFL Recruits Sports Gambling Operators</p>
<p>The NFL announced yesterday that it has created new partnerships with sports gambling operators, including Caesars Entertainment, DraftKings and FanDuel. Multi-year agreements are now in place that will give the sportsbooks access to NFL brands to use with their retail and online gambling solutions. The agreements also give them the ability to develop free-to-play games themed around the NFL.</p>
<p>In return, the NFL is going to get access to “relevant sports betting content” from the trio of operators. The content will be included on NFL.com and the NFL App, but it isn’t clear if one operator gets priority over the others. DraftKings and FanDuel will also gain access to NFL highlights, game footage and Next Gen Stats content, while Caesars will include NFL content on its platforms. In addition, all three sportsbooks will rely on the NFL’s official data feed.</p>
<p>Expanded Partnerships Will Enhance Sports Gambling</p>
<p>DraftKings was already the Official Daily Fantasy Sports partner of the NFL and can now include the tag of Official Sports Betting Partner. It will work with the league to offer new content and products that will appear on its apps and will also continue its presence on the NFL RedZone channel. The operator reportedly has “exclusive rights” to NFL intellectual property (IP) and branding.</p>
<p>Caesars has been the NFL’s Official Casino Sponsor and will now expand the relationship to include the title of Official Sports Betting Partner. On the casino side, Caesars has widespread access to the NFL’s marks and IP for use at its casinos and will develop “tentpole activations” at certain NFL events, including the NFL Draft. On the sports gambling side, Caesars will now develop engagement opportunities at its online and retail sportsbooks.</p>
<p>FanDuel is the newcomer to the group. It is just now partnering with the NFL but will integrate league content into its sportsbook and fantasy sports platform. It will be able to use NFL footage and will collaborate with the league to develop “pre-game integration opportunities” that will appear on the NFL Network during the seven games the broadcaster is covering in the upcoming season. FanDuel CEO Matt King, asserts, “This partnership provides our shared customers with a new level of innovation and unmatched premium content directly within our platform, ultimately enhancing every gameday.”</p>
