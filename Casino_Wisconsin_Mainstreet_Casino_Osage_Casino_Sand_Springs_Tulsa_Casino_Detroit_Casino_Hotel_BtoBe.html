<p>Malte Hegeler Becomes BtoBet VP of Product</p>
<p>Hegeler has over 15 years of experience in sports betting and is well familiar with the sector. Thanks to this, he will be able to help BtoBet improve its offering. In his new position at the sports betting supplier, the appointee will be responsible for the company’s product strategy. He will also oversee the BtoBet roadmap and the development of new products.</p>
<p>Hegeler’s experience made him a perfect pick for the position. He will leverage his expertise in sports betting to help BtoBet produce more and better products for leading sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The new hire joins the NeoGames subsidiary from OddsMatrix, EveryMatrix’s sports data platform, where he served as an interim chief executive officer and head of product development. Prior to that, Hegeler worked as head of sportsbook at RSF Management. His earlier experiences include four years with Primebet, as well as four years with Sportigo, among other roles.</p>
<p>MD Reiderman Welcomed Hegeler to the Company</p>
<p>BtoBet’s managing director, Dima Reiderman, welcomed Hegeler on board, saying that the supplier is happy to have him around. Reiderman said that BtoBet should secure strong product vision and leadership if it is to further evolve and develop best-in-class sports betting products for its partnering operators around the world. The MD concluded that Hegeler’s knowledge and skill will be crucial to realizing the company’s vision and cementing BtoBet as a leading sportsbook supplier.</p>
<p>Hegeler also spoke about his new position. He lauded BtoBet as a company that has been continuously meeting the requests of influential companies within the sports betting industry. He praised BtoBet’s knack for devising market-leading sports wagering solutions and said that he is excited to be a part of the company.</p>
<p>Coupled with BtoBet’s commitment to deliver flexible and superior sportsbook solutions and services, I’m thrilled to join this talented team and build on their momentum. Malte Hegeler, VP of product, BtoBet</p>
<p>BtoBet has been steadily expanding its global presence. In 2022, one of the company’s focuses was the budding African gaming industry. Earlier this year, the supplier agreed to provide its solutions to Ngnatat Sarl Trading’s Bet237 brand in Cameroon. In August, the supplier also launched in Mozambique with SOJOGO and in Ethiopia with UtopBet.</p>
