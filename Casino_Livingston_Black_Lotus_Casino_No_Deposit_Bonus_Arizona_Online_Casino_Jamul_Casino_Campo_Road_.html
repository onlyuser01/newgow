    <h1>Casino Livingston Black Lotus Casino No Deposit Bonus Arizona Online Casino Jamul Casino Campo Road</h1>

<p>LynxBet is just one of the many igaming brands out there seeking to connect closer with their target audiences. To this end, the company has teamed up with Brazilian MMA fighter Paulo Costa who has become an ambassador for the brand in the country and will help boost the company’s footprint and engage on a deeper level with fans.</p>
<p>LynxBet Joins Forces with Brazilian Fighter Paulo Costa s</p>
<p>Costa will assist LynxBet in establishing a more distinguishable marketing strategy for the company which will be targeting Millenials in Brazil. The fighter is particularly popular with younger audiences which makes him a prime pick for the company which is looking to alter its targeting models and stick with younger fans. Commenting on this partnership, LynxBet country manager for Brazil and LatAm Samantha Asensi said:</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to have Paulo Costa on board as our brand ambassador for Brazil. As a popular sports star who is revered throughout the country, he is perfect to represent LynxBet as we continue to attract new players to join the Land of LynxBet.”</p>
<p>MMA is big in Brazil and in fact, it’s second only to soccer in the region. This makes the tie-up with Costa a particularly smart business move by LynxBet which is continuing to work on its Latin American footprint. The pair will work on a number of casino and sportsbook brand activations across social media.</p>
<p>Costa has millions of followers to whom LynxBet will get direct access through this tie-up. The partnership will further put the betting company on the market in the region and enable it to connect with audiences through the things and people they love.</p>
<p>Striking Home with Younger Demographics in Brazil and LatAm</p>
<p>LynxBet wants to draw attention to its product offering which is focusing on the interactive betting and gaming segments that are conducted in compliance with responsible gambling standards. LynxBet’s offer is focused on casual players first and foremost as the company is planning on growing its footprint in South America.</p>
<p>Part of the company’s long-term commitment to the region is to create personalized experiences. LynxBet already runs a sister brand, Freebitco.in, which has more than 48 million players available. The two brands are working together on cross-selling strategies and Costa’s addition is a fitting addition.</p>
<p>“Paulo has already shown a great deal of enthusiasm in collaborating with us and pushing the brand in Brazil to the next level, helping us to create brand awareness through his impressive social media audience reach,” Asensi concluded.</p>
