<p>The 2018 World Cup runners-up are competing in Group F, but bookies don’t think Croatia will win this group. We don’t think so either. In fact, we think the Croats might even struggle to get to the knockout stage of the Qatar World Cup.</p>
<p>Whether they advance or not won’t depend only on them. Actually, we believe that their destiny is in the hands (or should we say legs?) of Canada. If the Canadians do well in their first World Cup in 36 years, Croatia will finish in the bottom half of the Group F table. Of course, this is also because we’re 100% certain Belgium will win the group.</p>
<p>2022 World Cup Group F Winner Prediction – Belgium (-161)</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Belgium isn’t among the top candidates to win the 2022 World Cup. Instead, bookmakers see this seam as the no.9 favorite to lift the trophy on December 18. They do, however, think the Belgians will win their group.</p>
<p>If this all seems strange, there’s a perfectly easy explanation. The thing is that Belgium has a fantastic roster with players that should be able to dominate Group F. However, the 2022 World Cup bracket is made in such a way that if the Belgians win the group, they will have to take on the runner-up of Group E.</p>
<p>The reason why this is such a problem is that the Group E runner-up is almost certainly going to be one of these two teams – Germany or Spain.</p>
<p>Group F Runner-Up Prediction – Canada (+400)</p>
<p>Now, this may seem like a longshot, but we have an explanation for this pick. The Canadians are going to be super-motivated in Qatar as this is their first World Cup since 1986. Further, these guys are really getting in the mood for soccer, knowing that the next World Cup will be (partially) held in Canada.</p>
<p>That said, the atmosphere is great in Canada’s locker room, but that’s not the only reason why we think they can surprise the odds and finish second in Group F. They also have some really amazing players on the roster – Alphonso Davies, Cyle Larin, Jonathan David, and others.</p>
<p>The best thing is that – unlike those playing for Croatia – most of Canada’s key men are still in their 20s.</p>
<p>Best Group F Prop Bet – Morocco Not to Qualify for Knockouts (-400)</p>
<p>This is probably the safest bet you can make for Group F. We think there’s no way Morocco will advance to the next stage of the tournament in Qatar. These guys might not finish bottom, but we see no scenario in which they’d finish in one of the first two places in the group table.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean they’re not good. On the contrary, player-by-player, they are more talented than Canada. They’re also probably more athletic than Croatia. However, this team usually doesn’t do great in big matches.</p>
