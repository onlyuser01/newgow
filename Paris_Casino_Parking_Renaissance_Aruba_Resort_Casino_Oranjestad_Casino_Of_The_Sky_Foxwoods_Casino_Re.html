<p>72% Growth in Regulated Market Turnover for Red Tiger</p>
<p>Red Tiger, the casino game and software developer, has announced that 2020 was the best year in the company’s history. For the last 12 months, the company has seen impressive growth of 72% in regulated market turnover. Marking the culmination was the company’s takeover by Evolution. In fact, the company was purchased by Evolution alongside NetEnt earlier this month, in one of the industry’s biggest B2B deals.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Head of Account Management at Red Tiger, Nick Vuchev, said that 2020 has been a difficult year for many, and Red Tiger was very conscious when it comes to achievements. With that in mind, according to him, in 2020, there is much that Red Tiger can be proud of.</p>
<p>“Now that we’re part of the Evolution Group, I’m very confident that there is even more success to come in 2021.” Nick Vuchev, Head of Account Management at Red Tiger</p>
<p>Vuchev stressed that the company’s product and partner portfolios, as well as the opportunities for expanding in regulated markets, represent the hard work of everyone at Red Tiger. In conclusion, he said that this year’s good results only complement the unstoppable company success since its launch in 2015.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Increases Presence in Regulated Markets</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Red Tiger celebrated its 6th birthday this October. As noted, in the last 12 months, the company has witnessed significant market growth. In fact, by the end of 2020, it is expected that Red Tiger would have completed over 70 new integrations with operators including Veikkaus, Sky Vegas, Partouche, SK365, and Win2Day.</p>
<p>Red Tiger has also strengthened its presence in regulated markets in the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Finland, Austria, Denmark, and Estonia. Furthermore, the company went live in Pennsylvania with Rush Street Interactive last month.</p>
<p>The brands that have already completed the integration of Red Tiger’s titles were among the first to benefit from games like Dragon’s Luck Deluxe, Path of Destiny, Aurum Codex, Yucatan’s Mystery, Lords of the Wilds, and Regal Streak. Furthermore, in July, Red Tiger released Gonzo’ QuestTM MegawaysTM – a game which proved to be an immediate success. In fact, this was the studio’s most successful ever launch which has reached over one billion spins until now.</p>
<p>More than 11,000 jackpots were won by players enjoying the studio’s games. This number represents an equivalent of 33 jackpots a day, with more than 40 million Euros paid over the year.</p>
