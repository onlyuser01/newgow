<p>Evolution is expanding its U.S. market presence by inking a partnership with Wynn. Under the agreement, the leading B2B casino system provider will launch live game content for customers of Wynn on the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Evolution and Wynn Ink Key Partnership for the U.S. Market</p>
<p>The leading B2B live casino system provider Evolution entered into a partnership with Wynn Sports Interactive (WSI). Under the agreement signed on October 16, Evolution will provide Live Casino content and services for Wynn on the U.S. market. Initially, under the partnership, Evolution will launch live games for customers of Wynn in New Jersey. But according to Evolution’s press release, the company’s content is going to reach more states soon.</p>
<p>The partnership brings a variety of live games for Wynn Sports players including multiple games streamed live from the Atlantic City studio by Evolution. Players in New Jersey can now enjoy Roulette, Blackjack, Infinite Blackjack, Baccarat, Three Card Poker, Ultimate Texas Hold’em, as well as the Dream Catcher money wheel game show.</p>
<p>“Wynn is a brand synonymous with casino.” Robert Amerine, VP Corporate Development at Wynn Resorts</p>
<p>According to Robert Amerine, VP Corporate Development at Wynn Resorts, the company’s goal is to ensure that the players have access to the very best online live dealer and RNG table games in the world. In conclusion, Amerine outlined that together with Evolution, the company is confident that it will deliver the best quality and choice to the players.</p>
<p>Evolution Continues to Grow on U.S. Market</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer Malta and Chief Commercial Officer at Evolution, Johan Nordstrom also shared his positive thoughts. He outlined that the company is honored to be working with WSI. Nordstrom said that this is a move that further extends Evolution’s reach on the U.S. market. In conclusion, he outlined that Evolution is very excited by the two-way cross-sell opportunity that exists between the sportsbook and Live Casino worlds.</p>
<p>“The power of the Wynn brand with exceptional content is a potent combination.” Johan Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer Malta and Chief Commercial Officer at Evolution</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the recent deal only proves that Evolution is increasing its presence in the U.S. Furthermore, according to an interim report by Evolution released in July, the company’s profits for the first half of 2020 have nearly doubled.</p>
<p>With that in mind, back in August, Evolution and BetMGM inked an agreement under which the company launched live table and show games across BetMGM websites. But that’s not all. Another key partnership was signed between Evolution and William Hill last week, under which live casino solutions by Evolution were launched for customers of William Hill across the U.S.</p>
