<p>New set of gaming solutions by Scientific Games were released yesterday. Those solutions are beneficial for both casino operators and players.</p>
<p>SG Releases New Software Solutions Needed in the Post COVID-19 Business Scene</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 27, leading iGaming software company Scientific Games presented a new set of contactless gaming solutions. With those solutions, the company is aiming to help both casino operators and clients by offering a convenient, yet safe way to conduct business. SG has not stood idly and has seen the need for such a product, in the face of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread. The company has responded by creating a new set of solutions which offers increased sanitation protocols but also helps with social distancing. Those solutions undoubtedly are going to be needed in the post COVID-19 business world. The set of solutions include: Unified Wallet, Social Distancing Module and Automated Game Sanitization.</p>
<p>Executive Vice President and Gaming Group Chief Executive, Matt Wilson, commented on the compelling news: “Scientific Games has always been committed to innovation, but it is now more critical than ever to develop solutions that help our partners address and adapt to the new normal.” He continued by saying that the new software solutions will greatly benefit both the partners and players while at the same time providing the necessary level of gaming experience. Wilson did not miss to say that the innovative product is available for Scientific Games’ partners now and this technology sets a “new standard for the industry.“</p>
<p>What Are SG’s New Products?</p>
<p>SG’s Unified Wallet enables the players to access games without the need of bringing cash. Players can play their favorite slots and tables games and accessing the funds instantly from their mobile device. There is a high chance that operators will also find this solution as quite helpful. Cashless transactions with the help of the unified wallet will mark an end to the need for ATM withdrawals and lines at kiosks or casino cages to redeem a ticket. Furthermore, in the long run, this solution will also reduce the operator’s maintenance bills, including ticket printers and ticket redemption kiosks.</p>
<p>Next in line we have the Social Distancing Module. This innovative solution will be quite beneficial for gaming operators. It offers three further features: dynamic distancing, EGM scheduler and resort and game reserve. Dynamic Distancing helps with maintaining social distancing between slot and table players by disabling close games once a player takes a seat. The EGM Scheduler lets the operators upload the list of games relevant for their casino floors. Resort Reserve and Game Reserve enables the players to keep their favorite game during the visit in the casino. Players can also tailor their experience while at the same time staying safe.</p>
<p>Last but not least there’s the Automated Game Sanitation. This feature removes the manual search for sanitizing frequently played games on the casino floor. The Automated Game Sanitation identifies those games and assists with timely sanitation. The casino operators can also use this feature to set regular interval sanitation for the games at their venue.</p>
