    <h1>Longhorn Casino Las Vegas Casino Jobs Near Me Harrah S Hotel Casino Atlantic City Meskwaki Casino Be</h1>

<p>Hello Petronela,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the quick response. I will try to answer the questions as detailed as possible.</p>
<p>Has my account been verified?</p>
<p>My account is fully verified including payment method.</p>
<p>Are the monies withheld winnings or deposit?</p>
<p>It's exactly €200 from a fully wagered bonus, around €300 real money from a deposit I've been playing with for a while (can't tell exactly without accessing the site) and around €200 partially wagered bonus. The amount in dispute should actually be around €500, excluding the bonus.</p>
<p>In fact, I had already wanted to have the €200 paid out, but the payout was canceled for alleged technical reasons a few hours before the service in DE was discontinued with the message that I should request it again. The fact that technical reasons were mentioned is also proof that the account is verified, because otherwise the reason would have been a lack of verification. I suspect that this was done on purpose to delay the withdrawal (the casino gives itself 36 hours to process a withdrawal and the 36 hours had expired) in order to be able to keep the €200. I will attach a screenshot of the email.</p>
<p>I then, to prevent an available bonus from expiring, deposited €350 instead of making a new request (active bonuses automatically cancel withdrawal requests) and after a few hours of play then access from DE was blocked and the €200+ approx. €300 retained from the last deposit.</p>
<p>Have I been warned that the site will no longer be accessible from my region?</p>
<p>No, I wasn't. Of course, there may be a clue hidden somewhere on the site, but if there is, it's not very visible. However, customers cannot be expected to search the last few corners of the casino for clues as to whether the service will be discontinued in the next few days.</p>
<p>The casino assigns customers a personal advisor and I called mine a day or two beforehand (what makes a good casino to me, what kind of bonuses are my favorites etc.). If the casino were interested in warning the customers in advance, then the warning would have come in this conversation, but it was not mentioned at all, otherwise I would of course not have made a deposit on the day the service was discontinued. The casino also has a German customer service so the agent had to know I would be affected but didn't warn me and credited me with an extra bonus a day or two before the DE ban.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the aborted payment due to alleged technical problems and the omission of the warning in the phone call to the personal customer advisor was deliberately deceptive in order to be able to withhold the money. Whether this is so is speculation, but the casino's refusal to pay out the money is definitely theft.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
