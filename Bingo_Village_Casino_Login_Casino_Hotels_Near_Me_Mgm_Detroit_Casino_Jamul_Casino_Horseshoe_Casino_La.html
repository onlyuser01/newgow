<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have deposited through Mifinity which is not available for withdrawing money on your site. at least for me. I have deposited also through Jeton which is available for withdrawing. So I asked for my withdrawal to Jeton wallet. I do not know what you are talking about when you say that I asked for a method which I did not deposit throug.</p>
<p>I have sent at least 10 documents you have requested through many emails, meanwhile my account was fully verified (I have submitted screenshots for casino.guru that my account was fully verified). I have sent every page of my Mifinity and Jeton wallets to Slottica. They know everything about me.... I don't know if this is not normal but anyway I sent them.</p>
<p>This sound like kidding to me because they just sent me an email that they "did not receive my documents".</p>
<p>Below the email I received 2 hours ago from Slottica (today 26.11.2022)</p>
<p>support@slotica.email</p>
<p>5:50 PM (2 hours ago)</p>
<p>to me</p>
