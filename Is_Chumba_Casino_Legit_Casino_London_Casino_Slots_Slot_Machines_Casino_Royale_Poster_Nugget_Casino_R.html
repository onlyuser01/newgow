    <h1>Is Chumba Casino Legit Casino London Casino Slots Slot Machines Casino Royale Poster Nugget Casino R</h1>

<p>The player has gambled several 1000 $ since this started and the account is still inactive for withdrawals. As for your terms of service and inactivity when your site was first developed it was well known and expected for players to "mine" your Chips in order to receive daily rewards at the time there were no exclusions for lack of frequent use nor requirements for continued deposits. I initially deposited well over $20,000 to earn those rewards and they were supposed to be paid in perpetuity. Why would I risk depositing anything into an account in which I currently can’t withdraw? I’m just supposed to "take your word" that suddenly I’ll be able to withdraw my money. As for the screen shots of conversations, you clearly don’t answer the question I specifically asked. So I will ask again, if I were to make a deposit how much money do I have to deposit and then gamble in order to be able to withdraw? Will I be able to withdraw immediately? Or will I only be able to withdraw the amount of money I deposited? If I were to win $1000 do I get to withdraw that? Or do I only get to withdraw what I deposited? What is the magic formula that you keep from saying? Specifically exactly how much do I have to deposit and gamble in order to be able to open up my withdraws to say $5000?</p>
