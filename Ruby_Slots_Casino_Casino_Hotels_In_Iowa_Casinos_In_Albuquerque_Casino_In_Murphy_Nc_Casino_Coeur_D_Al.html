<p>The leading provider of connectivity, cloud, managed hosting and security solutions to the global iGaming industry, Continent 8 Technologies, announced a new senior-level hire. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it selected Khaled El-Din for the role of Regional Sales Director. Joining the company, the seasoned expert with extensive sales and IT experience is expected to help drive its strategies.</p>
<p>In his new role as Regional Sales Director, El-Din, who is based in the UK, will be responsible for supporting Continent 8's sales division. He will focus on seizing new revenue opportunities within existing and emerging regulated gambling markets across the Americas, as well as Europe.</p>
<p>Moreover, El-Din will be in charge of amplifying the existing business-to-business relationships between Continent 8 and its partners. He will oversee and manage such processes, ensuring successful collaboration with the company's portfolio of clients.</p>
<p>The recent announcement appointment of El-Din comes on the heels of another important hire announced by Continent 8 earlier this month. At the time, the company confirmed it hired Carl Bonner who was tasked with the role of Regional Sales Director. This marked a strategic appointment for Continent 8, as the company was able to engage with the former Amazon Web Services executive who brought a wide range of skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Focusing on the most recent hire, El-Din revealed that he is thrilled to join the C-suite at Continent 8. In a statement, he explained: "This is a very exciting time to be joining Continent 8 as demand for its managed hosting, connectivity, cloud and security solutions is on the rise."</p>
<p>The new Regional Sales Director, who joins the company's global sales team, explained that Continent 8 is renowned across the globe for its quality services and solutions. El-Din added that it is an honor for him to join the senior-level management at the company. "I am looking forward to playing a part in helping operators and suppliers access the infrastructure they need to succeed as the gambling market continues to grow at pace, globally," he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>Nick Nally, Continent 8's Chief Revenue Officer, added: "Khaled is a fantastic addition to our global sales team, and we look forward to benefiting from his experience, skills, and commitment to customer satisfaction, as we look to better support existing customers and connect with new ones."</p>
<p>Before joining the company, El-Din held the role of Sales Manager at swcomms. His professional background includes leadership sales roles with Solar Communications and Chartered Developments. Throughout his career, El-Din was able to accumulate knowledge in sales, as well as IT, including hosting solutions. The wide range of skills undoubtedly make him a fine addition to Continent 8's growing team of experts.</p>
