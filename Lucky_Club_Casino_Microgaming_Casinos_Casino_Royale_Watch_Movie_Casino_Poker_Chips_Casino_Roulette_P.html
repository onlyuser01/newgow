    <h1>Lucky Club Casino Microgaming Casinos Casino Royale Watch Movie Casino Poker Chips Casino Roulette P</h1>

<p>The international supplier of iGaming content has signed a new partnership with Boyd Gaming Corporation, pushing into the US market</p>
<p>Playtech will deploy its range of live casino, iCasino and table games with Boyd Interactive Gaming, the digital arm of Boyd Gaming Corporation in the United States, and specifically through the Stardust-branded online casinos that the company operates in the country.</p>
<p>Boyd to Leverage Playtech’s Diverse Portfolio</p>
<p>The partnership is hailed as an important milestone in both companies’ ambitions for the US market, as Playtech has been doubling down on its local presence while Boyd Gaming is preparing to secure a larger share of the market in anticipation of online casino expansion across various states.</p>
<p>Presently, Boyd’s Stardust online casinos are available in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which are the states with the highest participation of interactive casino players, on the lookout for the best online slots, live and table games.</p>
<p>Boyd is planning to expand beyond those bastions, however, and a content injection from Playtech would give its library a distinct and player-focused quality.</p>
<p>Playtech USA CCO Marcus Yoder welcomed the new opportunity and said that it was an immense and exciting chance to see the company’s games incorporated into Stardust online casinos.</p>
<p>“The team at Playtech is thrilled to collaborate with the Boyd team and we are confident that the joining of our forces will bring mutual success to both companies,” Yoder added.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Boyd Interactive CEO Jim Ryan who was similarly positive of the development and said that the new titles introduced by Playtech would significantly strengthen the Stardust casino brand.</p>
<p>Expanding in North America and Looking to Deliver Exciting Games</p>
<p>Among the titles that players are now looking forward to exploring are such blockbuster hits as Gold Rush: Cash Collect and Adventures Beyond Wonderland.</p>
<p>Playtech has been growing its footprint globally, with the company even attempting a rumored acquisition of William Hill, volunteering to pay £700 million (approximately $887 million) during the summer, The Sunday Times reported.</p>
<p>The supplier has also been growing its North American footprint at a good pace with the company striking a similar content partnership with FanDuel in Canada.</p>
