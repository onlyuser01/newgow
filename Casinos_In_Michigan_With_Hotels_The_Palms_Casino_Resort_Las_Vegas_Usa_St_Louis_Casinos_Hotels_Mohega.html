<p>It’s finally here! Super Bowl Sunday LIV is upon us, and we’re just hours away from the big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>

<p>Over the past two weeks, billions of dollars have been wagered, both legally and illegally, on the Super Bowl. With the spread of legalized sports betting in the US and the fact that many believe the Chiefs and Niners will play a close game, many believe the big game will set a record handle.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the Super Bowl betting trends from the two of the top US sportsbooks.</p>
<p>FanDuel Bettors Like Chiefs Giving Points</p>
<p>Kansas City has stayed as a 1.5-point favorite for most of the two weeks between games, and bettors at FanDuel have largely been behind the Chiefs. As of early Sunday afternoon, 69 percent of the point spread bets at FanDuel have been on Kansas City giving the points. That action equates to 66 percent of the handle in FanDuel’s sportsbooks and mobile betting.</p>
<p>The moneyline is where you’ll find more 49ers bettors, as 58 percent of the straight up bets are on the Niners, whose straight up odds are +110 there. However, the handle is nearly split, as just 51 percent of the money wagered is on San Francisco.</p>
<p>Bettors at FanDuel expect the game to be high scoring. With total points set at 53.5, 70 percent of the bets on the over/under are on the over. Those account for 72 percent of the money bet as well.</p>
<p>William Hill Moneyline Bettors Like Niners</p>
<p>William Hill’s bettors are like those at FanDuel when it comes to the point spread. As of early Sunday afternoon (ET), six hours before kickoff, 64 percent of the book’s bettors are taking Kansas City and giving the point. Those bets represent 67 percent of the handle on the spread.</p>
<p>However, unlike FanDuel, the moneyline bettors are solidly behind San Francisco. William Hill has the Niners at even money odds. Through Sunday afternoon, 77 percent of the bets and 79 percent of the money are on San Francisco.</p>
<p>As far as the total – currently set at 54 – goes, bettors at William Hill like the over. Over bets account for 71 percent of the total bets and 72 percent of the handle.</p>
<p>As far as prop bets go, William Hill’s most popular prop hinges on KC quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ running ability and not his throwing arm. The top Super Bowl prop by number of tickets is Mahomes scoring a rushing touchdown. The odds for that happening is +350.</p>
<p>From a handle perspective, more money at William Hill is being wagered on Mahomes running for more than 35.5 yards than any other prop bet. Odds for that happening is -110.</p>
<p>Among the more intriguing bets at William Hill are two $100 bets, one on each team, scoring four points in the Super Bowl. The odds are +999900, or 9,999-1. According to Pro Football Reference, a team scoring four points has happened just once in 16,541 NFL games. On Nov. 25, 1923, the Racine Legion beat the Chicago Cardinals 10-4, with both of the Cardinals scores coming on safeties.</p>
