    <h1>Northern Quest Casino Concerts Davincis Gold Casino How Much Do Dealers Make In Casinos Mobile Casin</h1>

<p>I was playing Monopoly Live using autoplay on this site on June 14th. I decreased the number of autoplay rounds and kept the stake of each round the same (£12, £6 on 2 rolls and £6 on 4 rolls) I reduced from 7 rounds to 5 rounds at the same stake and went to get a drink. When I returned I saw there was a 2 rolls bonus round which paid 16x but no bet had been placed. I had been screen recording so I went back to see what happened and saw it said that autoplay had been stopped due to the loss limit being reached. The loss limit cannot be reached until the money you initially set has been reached and it cannot be reached if you reduced the number of rounds and don’t increase the stake.</p>
<p>i provided talkSPORTBET with the video evidence which shows what I’ve described above.</p>
<p>Evolution wrote to TalkSPORTBET claiming I had manually stopped the autoplay which is clearly not the case, I disputed this and have been waiting for over a week since with talkSPORTBET claiming it is still being investigated.</p>
<p>I feel that waiting for over a week for such a clear cut case is extremely unreasonable and don’t see the logic in awaiting another response from a company that has clearly lied already.</p>
<p>I have asked talkSPORTBET for a final response but they won’t issue one and claim I just have to wait. I have told them I will be issuing this complaint and refuse to use their site until I am paid in full.</p>
<p>£84 is the amount they owe since the returns for the £12 total stake would have been £96.</p>
