<p>No I’m not agreeing to that at all. This complaint was about superslots-ag and the fact that you guys continued to take my money after I asked for a closure for over a week and took over 4000 from me 2000 of which was my actual deposited money this has nothing to do with BOL OR SPORTSBETTING …, and it’s convenient how I already had 500 in my account on BOL but due to your shady withdrawal limits I wasn’t able to cash out yesterday like I tried to multiple times and then you guys ended up stealing that all back too and now that’s what you’re offer is to resolve this … how coincidental and convenient.., you’re going to offer me back the money that should have already been in my pocket that you wouldn’t let me cash out and then proceeded to use your rigged games to get back and now it’s your close out offer to me hahahhaha if that doesn’t just perfectly highlight my exact point of the shady and corrupt and criminal activity that you people do to your customers then I dont know what is. And the bottom line is that you now just hurried up to close my sports betting account so I couldn’t provide the transaction history here , and yoj refuse to submit the real history in question which is from super slots because you know it will totally prove my accusations and that you’ll be owing me much more than 500, and why would I have to wait til the 24th? If you didn’t hurry and close my sports betting account yoj could have just put the money in that account and I could have gotten it out right now and you could close it and the rest of the accounts up today and we could go our seperate ways… why stall this out even longer when it’s not neccessary what so ever ! ????</p>
