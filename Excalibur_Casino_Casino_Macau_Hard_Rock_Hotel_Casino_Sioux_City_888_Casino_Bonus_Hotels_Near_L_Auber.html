    <h1>Excalibur Casino Casino Macau Hard Rock Hotel Casino Sioux City 888 Casino Bonus Hotels Near L Auber</h1>

<p>Dear Guru!</p>
<p>I have a serious problem with Parimatch Casino and I need your help to resolve it.</p>
<p>To my great regret and surprise, my account was hacked, and $ 600 was withdrawn from my account to the bitcoin wallet.</p>
<p>I was able to see the lack of funds only on August 3, because I could not enter my account due to its blocking by the casino due to the fact that the wrong password was entered. Although I entered the correct one and did not even imagine that I was among the victims of hackers who hacked the casino system.</p>
<p>I did not contact the casino with a password recovery request on August 01 at 11:47 pm.</p>
<p>Also, I have never withdrawn money to a bitcoin wallet and do not have it at all!</p>
<p>In confirmation of the withdrawal of my funds by fraudsters, I am sending you an article posted in the public domain. A transfer was made to the Bitcoin address indicated in the article from the address to which my $ 600 went, which indicates a criminal scheme. Just like in the article, I had letters in the mail about password recovery, which I didnâ€™t repeat.</p>
<p>I believe that the casino has not taken proper measures to safeguard my funds.</p>
<p>And I should not be held liable, let alone incur losses due to the fault of the casino!</p>
<p>At the very least, casinos should have alerted:</p>
<p>request for password recovery;</p>
<p>change the method of deposit / withdrawal of funds;</p>
<p>minimum deposit and large withdrawal.</p>
<p>And, I want to note, these actions were carried out within a couple of hours! Where did the casino security service look, why did they not request personal information and documents for identification? If the casino used at least minimal protection methods, then no loss of funds from the account would have occurred! The scammers would not have been able to provide my personal documents.</p>
<p>I beg you to help me get my $ 600 back. For me, this is a significant amount, which I do not want to lose due to a casino oversight.</p>
