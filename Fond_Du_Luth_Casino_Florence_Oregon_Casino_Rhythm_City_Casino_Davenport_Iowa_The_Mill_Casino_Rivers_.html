    <h1>Fond Du Luth Casino Florence Oregon Casino Rhythm City Casino Davenport Iowa The Mill Casino Rivers</h1>

<p>Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has penalized three gambling companies. According to the regulator, they had all breached certain regulations and will have to compensate by paying fines.</p>
<p>The three companies the PGCB opted to fine are Stadium Casino Westmoreland, TDN Money Systems and CPC Bucks County. Some breached the regulations concerning customer safety, while the others were unable to provide important documents on time. In total, the three companies will have to pay $32,500 for their mistakes.</p>
<p>Three Companies Got Fines</p>
<p>Stadium Casino Westmoreland, the company which operates Live! Casino Pittsburgh’s mistake was allowing a self-excluded person to play. Not only that, but the person was also allowed at a table game and was even provided with a cash advance. This is a serious violation according to Pennsylvania’s regulations, resulting in a $7,500 fine for the company.</p>
<p>TDN Money Systems, on the other hand, was not diligent enough with a recent change of control. The company was divested to two other licensees but was unable to inform the PGCB on time. Because of this negligence, the company will also receive a $7,500 fine.</p>
<p>The last of the bunch is CPC Bucks County. Its breach isn’t exactly gambling-related but is the most serious of the three. Notably, it concerns the company’s Chickie’s and Pete’s restaurant at Parx Casino in Bensalem. According to the PGCB, the restaurant agreed to provide several customers with copious amounts of alcohol, leading to visible intoxication. Moreover, this didn’t happen only once. On the contrary, Chickie’s and Pete’s repeated the same mistake on three separate occasions, leading to the intoxication of six people in total. Because of its transgression, CPC Bucks County will have to pay a fine of $17,500.</p>
<p>The PGCB Fined Three More Companies in May</p>
<p>This announcement comes a month after the PGCB issued another bunch of fines. In May, the regulator fined another three companies for a total of $35,500. The fines’ recipients were Hollywood Casino, Underdog Sports and Wind Creek Casino.</p>
<p>Just like Stadium Casino Westmoreland, Hollywood Casino got a $7,500 fine for allowing a self-excluded person to play. Wind Creek Casino did the same and also allowed a self-excluded person to play. However, that person was allowed to play more than once. In fact, he but kept on returning for four days in a row. Because of this violation, the regulator fined the casino $20,000. Lastly, Underdog Sports was found guilty of offering unlicensed content, resulting in an $8,000 fine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pace-O-Matic continues its legal battle against the PGCB. The skill-based operator alleges that the authority is actively harassing providers of skill games because casino companies have paid it to do so.</p>
