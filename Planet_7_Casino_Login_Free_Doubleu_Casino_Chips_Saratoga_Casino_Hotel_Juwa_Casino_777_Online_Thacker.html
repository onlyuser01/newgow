<p>Five Chinese nationals kidnapped the unidentified man and locked him temporarily in the hotel room, according to the Philippine media outlet Inquirer.</p>
<p>Their plan included taking him elsewhere for reasons the authorities still try to ascertain. As the five criminals led him out the casino door, he could signal a guard, who came to his rescue. Outside the casino, a car was waiting for the group. From there, the destination is unknown.</p>
<p>The unidentified man reportedly owed around PHP500,000 (US$9,090).</p>
<p>Kidnapping Reports</p>
<p>There has been an increase in kidnappings linked to the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) last year, despite an overall drop in reported cases.</p>
<p>There were 31 kidnappings during the first nine months of 2022 in the Philippines, compared to 36 in the same period the year before. Of these, 17 were POGO-related, five more than in 2021. Those cases included 19 Chinese victims and others from Vietnam and Taiwan. In almost all scenarios, Chinese criminal gangs were behind the activity.</p>
<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), the Philippines’ gaming regulator and state-run casino operator, has argued that none of the licensed POGOs had anything to do with the crimes. Instead, the operators already lost their licenses or voluntarily gave them up.</p>
<p>Lawmakers continue to push for eliminating the POGO industry because of its relationship to criminal activity.</p>
<p>Casino Revenue on the Rise</p>
<p>Gambling revenue in the country is rising, and the relaxation of COVID-19-induced travel restrictions means more international traffic throughout Asia.</p>
<p>The casino segment in the Philippines continued to grow in the fourth quarter of last year, generating around PHP56.01 billion (US$1.02 billion) in gross gaming revenue (GGR). This beat the previous quarter by 13.5 % and marks a 96.2% jump from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The overall handle of the segment reached almost PHP184.00 billion (US$3.34 billion). This was 90.6% greater than the same period in 2021.</p>
