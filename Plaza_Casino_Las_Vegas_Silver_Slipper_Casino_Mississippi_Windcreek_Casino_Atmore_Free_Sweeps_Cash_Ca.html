<p>The company revealed that the interim CEO role will be filled by Seamus McGill, who currently holds the position of chairman of the Board</p>
<p>The leading North American business-to-business (B2B) technology provider of gaming solutions and international sports betting operator, GAN, announced changes to its senior-level management team. On Wednesday, the company confirmed that its Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Dermot Smurfit from his role as director of the company and its subsidiaries and chief executive officer (CEO).</p>
<p>GAN said that it is currently in the process of evaluating a consulting arrangement for Smurfit who is at present one of its substantial stockholders. In addition to the resignation, the company confirmed the appointment of an interim CEO.</p>
<p>Although the announcement came today, GAN said that Seamus McGill, the current chairman of the Board, will fill in the role of interim CEO as of September 26, 2023. It is yet to be confirmed if the company has already initiated a search for a permanent CEO. Still, McGill represents a strategic appointment for the interim role, considering his solid experience within the technology and gaming industries.</p>
<p>The latest change to GAN’s C-suite comes after early last month, the company released its financial results for the second quarter of the year. Overall, Q2 revenue hit $33.8 million, representing a slight dip when compared to the $35 million result from the corresponding period in 2022. At the time, Smurfit explained that GAN remains optimistic for the upcoming Q3 and Q4.</p>
<p>Interim CEO Brings Solid Experience</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest announcement, McGill joined GAN’s Board back in April 2014. In his new role as interim CEO, he brings 25 years of experience within the technology and gaming vertical. McGill’s professional career started with Mikohn Gaming Corporation. Before he moved to the United States, he worked for 3 years in Singapore and 7 years in Japan, allowing him to accumulate skills and experience from those vital markets.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming a part of the Board at GAN, McGill served as the president of the mobile software company, JOINGO. Additionally, his professional tenure includes a chief operating officer role with Aristocrat Technologies for five years. Throughout his extensive career, McGill was also a part of Cyberview Technology as well as WMS Gaming Inc, where he held different senior-level roles.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the entire Board and GAN team, I want to extend our appreciation to Dermot for his commitment to the Company since joining twenty years ago. Under Mr. Smurfit’s leadership, GAN experienced many great accomplishments and reached numerous milestones as a Company.“ Seamus McGill, interim CEO of GAN</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, McGill thanked Smurfit for his exceptional guidance and dedication to the company over the last two decades. He acknowledged that thanks to the guidance of Smurfit, GAN was able to hit multiple milestones and significantly expand its position. Finally, McGill said that he is honored to assume the responsibilities related to his new role with the company.</p>
