<p>Playson has appointed Nikolay Illiustrov as its new head of games and will work on helping the company establish its footprint in the future of igaming by guiding innovative gambling content for the firm as it prepares to conquer the highest echelons of the industry.</p>
<p>In his position, Illiustrov will work on further developing Playson’s slot portfolio as well as achieving international benchmarks which will be tied to growth and further reach for the existing products.</p>
<p>Enhancing Playson’s Development Process</p>
<p>Illiustrov will work on establishing various internal processes that will ensure that development goes as intended and better synergies are achieved across the board. Commenting on this appointment, Illiustrov said:</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to have been promoted to Head of Games of such a forward-thinking company like Playson. In my seven years here, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time and am looking forward to the next chapter.” Playson head of games Nikolay Illiustrov</p>
<p>Ultimately, Illiustrov wants to make sure that the product offer is on par with the company’s own standards and expectations, helping push the boundaries of igaming as a whole. He is not a chance pick either. Illiustrov joined the company back in 2015 as a game designer and has patiently worked his way through to the top, providing valuable input in the form of actionable design solutions for the games.</p>
<p>Illiustrov used market research and analysis to come up with sustainable and worthwhile new game concepts that resonate with players and seek to meet customer expectations. By taking a more central role in the development and planning of games, Illiustrov will help his company to continue scaling up its offer while focusing on content, retention, and establishing the right development techniques.</p>
<p>With the company recently evolving its brand identity, Playson has a lot to live up to. Enhanced growth strategy and games development process is all part of it, Illiustrov confirmed.</p>
<p>The Right Fit for the Job</p>
<p>His appointment was welcomed by Playson CEO Alex Ivshin who said that he was delighted to see Illiustrov promoted to the role.</p>
<p>The executive commended his passion for developing highly-immersive slot titles that strike home with players and are bound to help Playson meet its stated objectives. Playson has gone through some restructuring of late, particularly with the appointment of Vsevolod Lapin back in April.</p>
<p>The company also launched its titles with OlyBet in Estonia and Latvia. In other and saddening news, the company lost a valued team member in the face of Oleksandr Honcharuk who perished in the war in Ukraine. He died defending his country from the illegal invasion of the Russian army.</p>
