    <h1>Casino Royale 1967 Cast Kings Casino Ledgends Casino Casino Near Me Open Alhambra Casino Flutter Fun</h1>

<p>Flutter Entertainment, the company behind operators such as Paddy Power and Betfair, has once again demonstrated its commitment to responsible gambling. This time, the Irish operator provided the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC), a Toronto-based non-profit organization, with funding to conduct research on gambling ads.</p>
<p>RGC to Research Gambling Ads</p>
<p>RGC’s Centre for the Advancement of Best Practices will be responsible for conducting the research. Notably, the Centre will focus on researching how marketing within the gambling industry affects customers and how severely gambling ads impact problem gambling.</p>
<p>The study will be conducted in multiple phases. Its results will then be used as a base for recommendations to gambling regulators in North America. The RGC plans to warn operators such as Ontario’s Alcohol and Gaming Commission if it finds dangerous links between certain advertisement approaches and gambling harm.</p>
<p>The findings will help regulated operators improve their practices and launch advertising campaigns that are less harmful.</p>
<p>Flutter’s sponsorship of the RGC comes a few months after Ontario legalized sports betting and online gambling. Following that, both parties realized the need for a better understanding of how marketing affects players’ behavior and decision-making.</p>
<p>Flutter Is Glad to Support the RGC</p>
<p>Shelley White, the chief executive officer of the Responsible Gambling Council, commented on the research and its goals. She mentioned that the findings will help the RGC learn whether a change in advertising standards is needed. Although this research aims to help balance out the Ontario ecosystem, White believes that it will be helpful to jurisdictions all around the world.</p>
<p>This comprehensive study truly highlights the culture shift that the industry is currently undergoing, and by leveraging our research partners, we can make greater impacts in protecting players and communities. Shelley White, CEO, RGC</p>
<p>George Sweny, vice president of regulatory affairs at Flutter International, spoke about his company’s decision to fund the research.</p>
<p>We saw an opportunity to provide cutting edge thought leadership to the industry. There is a need to better understand the impacts of increased marketing and advertising on all stakeholders George Sweny, VP regulatory affairs, Flutter</p>
<p>Sweny trusts that RGC’s research will yield the needed results to make “the necessary strides towards bridging the gap between best and better practices.” He added that he is glad to be able to support the RGC and help with such an important research.</p>
