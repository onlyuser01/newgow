<p>The result is that the Ravens are 7-3 now, with one game played more than the other three teams from the AFC North Division. The Bengals and Steelers are second and third, each with a 6-3 record. At the bottom of the divisional table are the Bengals, who were one of the top Super Bowl favorites before the start of the season.</p>

<p>Cincy Doing Well in Big Games</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals lost to the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon in a game that they really should’ve won. First of all, the game was played on their turf. Secondly, they have a much better roster than the boys from Texas.</p>
<p>They did come close to taking the game to overtime, but the Texans scored the winning field goal in the final moment of the game. Cincinnati’s defense really should’ve done better in the opposition’s final drive, but it’s actually their offense that takes most of the blame for the loss.</p>
<p>The NFL’s highest-paid player Joe Burrow just didn’t do great that day. The quarterback went 27-for-40 for 347 yards and two touchdowns, which is far from bad. However, he also threw two interceptions.</p>
<p>The Ravens Need to Patch Up Their Defense</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens are the NFL’s best defense, which is conceding just 15.7 points per game. However, in their most recent game, the Ravens conceded 33 points to the Browns at home.</p>
<p>Actually, their defense conceded 27 points, while one of Cleveland’s touchdowns was a pick-six touchdown by their cornerback after a bad pass by Baltimore’s quarterback Lamar Jackson.</p>
<p>Jackson threw two interceptions in that game, his worst number so far in the 2023 season. He also completed only 13 of 23 attempted passes, thus recording his worst completion percentage of the 2023 NFL (56.5).</p>

<p>On a more positive note, he did throw for one touchdown, caught by Odell Beckham Jr., who seems to be getting back in top shape. More good news for the Ravens is that they did really well running the ball.</p>
<p>Jackson gained the most yards, but he didn’t record a rushing TD. Instead, Keaton Mitchell and Gus Edwards did it.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Baltimore Ravens Prediction</p>
<p>This game has the potential to be the most exciting game of the regular season. Both teams are in need of a win, not to mention that they’re AFC North rivals, so neither will be lacking any motivation on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The Ravens have a very good defense, but the Bengals are great offensively. If Joe Burrow shows up on Thursday, Cincinnati’s offense should be able to score at least a couple of touchdowns. But so should Baltimore.</p>
<p>The Ravens are great when it comes to rushing and should have no problems slicing through the Bengals’ defense. In the game against Houston, Cincinnati’s defense allowed 188 rushing yards, along with two rushing TDs. We expect to see something similar happen in the Week 11 TNF game as well.</p>
<p>As a result, we’ll probably see a very close game, which could even be decided after overtime. That said, our Bengals vs. Ravens pick is to go against the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Cincinnati Bengals +4</p>
