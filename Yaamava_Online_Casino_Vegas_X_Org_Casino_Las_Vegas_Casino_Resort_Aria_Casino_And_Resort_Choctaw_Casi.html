<p>The deal is in line with Hacksaw’s ambition to grow in Europe and beyond</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading provider of iGaming content, has bolstered its position in the Greek gambling market thanks to a new content distribution deal with N1 Casino. Following the agreement, the supplier’s content has been rolled out on the Greek casino operator’s online platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to the arrangement, players in Greece will be able to play many of Hacksaw Gaming’s hits, including evergreens such as Wanted Dead or a Wild and Hand of Anubis. New releases such as Drop’em will also be available for local slots enthusiasts to try out.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is an up-and-coming studio that was founded in 2019. Originally a supplier dedicated to developing scratch cards, the company eventually started to produce cutting-edge slot games. The quality of its titles quickly became universally recognized, allowing it to earn CasinoBeats’ Outperforming Game Studio of the Year – Medium award.</p>
<p>N1 Casino, on the other hand, is a member of the N1 partners program that is focused on the iGaming industry. Encompassing N1 Casino, N1 Bet, Joo Casino and Slot Hunter, the program continues to target multiple jurisdictions all over the world.</p>
<p>The N1 Partners companies boast a collective portfolio of more than 10,000 games from 100+ providers.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Continues Its International Growth</p>
<p>An N1 representative commented on the new deal, saying that it “marks an exciting milestone” for both parties involved. They said that the partnership will surely “flourish and bring mutual success” to both N1 and Hacksaw.</p>
<p>The synergy between our brands is evident, and we are excited to embark on this journey together. N1 representative</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hacksaw Gaming’s chief executive officer, Marcus Cordes, said that the new deal “marks another signal” of his team’s intentions to grow its presence in regulated markets and present its games to new audiences.</p>
<p>Cordes underscored the importance of Greece to his team, as well as his company’s delight to join forces with N1 Casino.</p>
<p>Greece is an important market for us, so we’re delighted to team up with a leading name in N1 Casino to help broaden our European reach further. Marcus Cordes, CEO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hacksaw Gaming continues its journey to conquer new markets. A week ago, the provider injected games into GBO, expanding its presence in Italy. Earlier this month, the company entered the lucrative US market, supplying content to Rush Street Interactive in West Virginia.</p>
