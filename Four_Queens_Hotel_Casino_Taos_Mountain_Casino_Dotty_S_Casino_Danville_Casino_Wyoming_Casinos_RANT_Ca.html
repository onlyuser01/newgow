    <h1>Four Queens Hotel Casino Taos Mountain Casino Dotty S Casino Danville Casino Wyoming Casinos RANT Ca</h1>

<p>With al due respect I play almost 8 years online and done many SOW check at different casino’s. There was not one casino that asked me to deliver proof of funds that I won almost 6 months ago. And why they didn’t sent me a Sow earlier on a sister casino then? I deposit monthly 1 or 2k at a sister casino and deposit around 10k there in the last 6 months and no problems with cashing out. You know why because I lost more then I won with them. I deposit 3.5k at rant and poof it triggered the sow yeah right. They let me wait so long 9 days to be exact until I played the balance away that’s fair online gaming these days? The case is simple I give Rant casino 5 days from now to sent me my original win of 15k if not I send everything to my bank en let them charge back al my deposits at the Gammix group due to fraudulent behavior I have proof enough already Rant Casino has around 30.000 customers from Holland at the moment and they are breaking the law and they know it the KSA did already warned them. If Rant choose not to pay me I gonna contact the KSA everyday to speed things up and that they are gonna be fined for breaking the law I also gonna adres this matter on every gambling forum I can find and tell people to not play at any Gammix casino. I don’t even care about the money at the moment online gambling must be fair and not delaying peoples payment due to ridiculous rules. If you are happy to accept the deposit you must also pay if a player wins and not wait and delaying till the player plays his winnings away! That’s unfair behavior and with behavior like that the casino always wins. On 30-06-2022 when they first asked me for source of wealth documents I sent them more then enough proof that my deposit are covered with clean legit money that’s proof enough. I say it again my winnings at Rant casino had nothing to do with me depositing money last January at a sistercasino of them. If they are worried we’re the funds came from why let me deposit al those months at a sistercasino without any questions asked? When I told them I can not deliver proof of the winnings from last January the could have paid me my winnings and close my account no they keep delaying and saying if you don’t sent proof we don’t pay you. But in the meanwhile sending me emails to deposit at casinos of the Gammix group…. As last banks here are obligated by law if you recieve large sums on your bank account to see if the funds are clean/legit so if my bank has no problems with me recieve the funds why should a casino have problems with it typical delaying tactics from the casinos side.</p>
