<p>Moving forward, Danielle Calafato will serve as the company’s new chief commercial officer (CCO). The company is looking to further boost its growth plans and recent commercial successes which will be possible with Calafato at the helm. The company will move Mats Lundin to the role of director of sales as well.</p>
<p>Preparing for an Even Busier Growth Period</p>
<p>Since joining the company as head of commercial in 2021, Calafato has been an important part of the overall Gaming Corps business structure and an integral part of its expansion strategy. Gaming Corps is fully committed to maintaining a strong pace of growth and development with the company setting up a hub in Malta, and planning to push into new jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>There are hard numbers to back the company’s aspirations, too. Annual net sales have increased by 628% in Q4 2022, the company reported. Gaming Corps now collaborates with 400 operator brands and claims that another 400 brands are set to go live. The newly-appointed CCO has hailed the opportunity to be shifting in yet another important position within the company.</p>
<p>She welcomed the opportunity and said that she was all prepared to help guide Gaming Corps to a better tomorrow. “We have big plans in the pipeline, and I am confident that with the talent and expertise of our team, we will achieve even greater heights,” Calafato concluded.</p>
<p>Lundin is also happy with the shift, as the company is preparing to strengthen its fleet of brands and continue to expand, praising the progress the company has made. “We’ve seen a great deal of change and as what is still a young company, we’re very accomplished at adapting with great success,” Lundin explained.</p>
<p>Over the past months, Gaming Corps has significantly expanded its clout by signing a partnership with GOAT Interactive in the African market. Back in Europe, the company signed a partnership with Napoleon in Belgium. Gaming Corps was also able to significantly expand its content reach through a tie-up with Gaming Innovation Group.</p>
<p>Lundin was confident that he and Calafato would make a strong team that would help steer Gaming Corps through the upcoming busy period of new launches and partnership opportunities.</p>
