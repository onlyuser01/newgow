    <h1>No Deposit Bonus Code Raging Bull Casino Casino Hotels In Phoenix Az Casinos Charlotte Palace Casino</h1>

<p>Please forgive me as I was hasty and upset when I filed my original complaint. I had forgot to mention that I had reached $51 and change after playing 777, thus reaching the $50 minimum. It was then that I tried to cashout again for the $50 minimum and was rejected because I had played 777. 777 was supposed to be prohibited, and had been unplayable, but then all of a sudden the website let me play. It didn't block it due to bonus restrictions as it normally does. That also contributed to my belief of the bonus being finished. The lack of investigation of my account by Yabby based from this complaint shows their lack of concern for customer satisfaction due the fact that they should've seen my withdrawal request for $50. And following that, the investigator should of seen a transcript of my play history or something that shows (just like the email I received from them) that I was rejected because I played 777, not because I tried to withdraw only $31.40. Also, you cannot even put a withdrawal request through unless you have $50 or more in your account. How does the investigator not know this about their own website? And yes, I've been verified but I don't know since when. I used a no deposit bonus. I did not receive any kind notice that the wagering of the bonus was finished other than the widget on their website showing $0 Bonus Balance and $0 Playthrough with Real Balance $51. 00 . I spoke with a live chat agent yesterday and responded to their email about the rejection of my withdrawal request. I never got an email back and the live chat agent said the same thing the email they sent me and then abruptly ended the chat. I hope that answers most or all your questions.</p>
