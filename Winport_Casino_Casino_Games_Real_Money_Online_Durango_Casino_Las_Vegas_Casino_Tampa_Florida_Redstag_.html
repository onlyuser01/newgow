<p>PressEnter Group has strengthened its senior management team by appointing industry veteran Phillip Bell as the new chief commercial officer</p>
<p>Malta-based company that provides entertainment to the online casino industry via its premium gaming products, PressEnter Group, has announced it would be strengthening its senior management by adding industry veteran Phillip Bells to the team.</p>
<p>Appointed as the new chief commercial officer, Bell will join the group that incorporates brands like NitroCasino, XLBet, UltraCasino, JustSpinat, and 21.com at a busy time following its effective Management Buyout (MBO) toward the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Phillip to Support the Group’s Long-Term Plans</p>
<p>Ever since the MBO took place, the company used the leadership of chief executive officer Lahcene Merzoug and his management team to optimize all operations while promoting an entrepreneurial culture able to penetrate all aspects of the group.</p>
<p>In this particular context, Bell’s appointment is expected to further help the group reach its long-term scalability and sustainable growth plans.</p>
<p>From his new position, Bell will be responsible for drawing up and implementing a series of optimized strategies aimed at business and commercial growth both in the short and long run.</p>
<p>In this regard, the new CCO will use his impressive track record and experience as head of partnerships at the QiH Group as well as his marketing and commercial positions at iconic industry operators like Ladbrokes, Esports Entertainment Group, and Argyll Entertainment.</p>
<p>CEO Lahcene praised Bell’s successful activity across the previous companies he worked for, calling him “a great addition” to the group’s currently “incredibly strong senior management team.”</p>
<p>“An Honor and an Adventure” to Take on the Role</p>
<p>Bell called it “both an honor and an adventure” to accept the new position as CCO at PressEnter Group while expressing delight for being part of the “forward-thinking business during such an important chapter.”</p>
<p>While only having spent a short time with the company, Bell explained that he was able to witness its brilliance first-hand while collaborating with the “creative, talented, and innovative team.”</p>
<p>The new CCO also explained that he was prepared to provide his personal input and experience with the purpose of driving innovation and promoting quicker growth rates while making sure the group remains a “trailblazer in the industry.”</p>
<p>In March, popular game provider Swintt entered a new agreement with PressEnter, with the purpose of using the latter’s fast-developing network of online casinos to enter fresh markets and strengthen its foothold there.</p>
<p>In December 2022, PressEnter launched CasinoFest, a new casino meant to disrupt the iGaming industry and provide a fresh way of enjoying online casino gameplay.</p>
