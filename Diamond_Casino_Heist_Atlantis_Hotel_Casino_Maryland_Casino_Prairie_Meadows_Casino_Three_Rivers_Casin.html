<p>Supplier of slots for the iGaming sector EGT Interactive has teamed up with 888 Holdings for new content alliance starting in Romania, but targeting markets in Spain, Italy and Portugal next.</p>
<p>EGT Delivers Quality Slots to 888casino in New Content Deal</p>
<p>Slot developer and supplier EGT Interactive has entered into a content partnership with 888 Holdings, the preeminent provider of gaming solutions and entertainment options, the companies have revealed in a statement.</p>
<p>The partnership is designed to help 888 Holdings expands its current product offering and to allow EGT Interactive to reach new audiences through diversifying 888’s existing portfolio of products.</p>
<p>To this end, EGT is putting forth some of its premium gaming content and classic games, spanning numerous game themes and mechanics, including Zodiac Wheel, Burning Hot, Book of Magic, Shining Crown, Amazons’ Battle, and others.</p>
<p>The first market where the companies have chosen to collaborate is Romania through 888casino, the holdings’ iGaming brand. Romanian players already have access to the full portfolio of EGT Interactive products and adding to the world-class experience 888 has offered to consumers for years now.</p>
<p>An Opportunity to Strengthen Brand Presence in Romania and Beyond</p>
<p>EGT’s unique understanding of Romanian consumer needs allows the company to tailor a bundle of products that are well-received in the country and that will empower 888’s portfolio a notch further. The partnership could prove a stepping-stone for the companies in other markets of mutual interest, such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</p>
<p>EGT Interactive Managing Director Todor Zahariev said that the company was proud to put a start to what should be an exciting partnership and opportunity for both businesses. The deal will enable the supplier to continue on delivering a world-class slot games to customers, Zahariev added.</p>
