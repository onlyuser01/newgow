<p>Supplier of gambling and lottery technology International Game Technology (IGT) became the first US gaming industry supplier to receive accreditation for its sports betting operations from the Global Gambling Guidance Group (G4), the tech company announced this week.</p>
<p>‘Leading the Industry with Responsible Gaming Initiatives’</p>
<p>The accreditation granted for IGT’s sports betting operations by G4 means that IGT is now certified as a responsible gaming supplier across all of its four product segments: lottery, gaming, digital and betting.</p>
<p>“G4 applauds IGT for making responsible gaming a top priority across all of its business verticalsG4 appreciates having IGT as an accredited member and glad to see the company continue leading the gaming industry with its responsible gaming initiatives.” Pieter Remmers, Chairman, Board of Directors, G4</p>
<p>The worldwide accreditation program promoted by the group of international experts in the field of problem gambling behind G4 seeks to minimize the impact of problem gambling by auditing tools, systems, and processes at land-based, online and lottery operators, as well as software and technology suppliers.</p>
<p>IGT received its G4 certification for responsible gaming operations in 2017 and went on to certify with the program its digital solutions in 2019, and the latest certification of its sports betting operations positioned it as a role model for the entire industry.</p>
<p>“IGT’s proactive approach to responsible gaming and achieving prestigious G4 certifications sets the pace for the entire industry to go above and beyond what state regulation mandates when it comes to player protection.” Joe Asher, President, Sports Betting, IGT</p>
<p>The G4 certification means IGT has passed the rigorous audit and has a responsible gaming code of practice related to its corporate practices based on a strong management commitment to responsible gaming and its policies and practices support a broad responsible gaming framework.</p>
<p>First Industry Supplier with Sports Betting Accreditation</p>
<p>According to Asher, the company “is actively demonstrating” the importance of “strong responsible gaming support,” especially now as sports betting legalization and expansion across the nation continues at an unprecedented speed.</p>
<p>“We are honored to be the first industry supplier to achieve sports betting responsible gaming accreditation and we look forward to working with our customers to implement our best-in-class solutions for their players,” he concluded.</p>
<p>G4 certification also covers areas like availability of player protection information, an advertising and marketing code of principles for responsible gaming, responsible gaming policies training and support delivered to employees, availability of player protection tools, including player-led time and money limits, self-exclusion and age verification, as well as research delivered by third parties to help improve these tools.</p>
<p>IGT’s lottery and iLottery businesses are also certified by the World Lottery Association (WLA) for Corporate Social Responsibility Standards and Responsible Gaming Framework for Suppliers.</p>
<p>In March, IGT demonstrated its strong commitment to problem gambling by launching the Positive Play campaign to raise public awareness for responsible gambling during the Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
