    <h1>Econo Lodge Lake Elsinore Casino Zula Casino Casinos Near Atlanta Ga Casino In New York Casino Farmi</h1>

<p>Have a question about how a casino like bitstarz.com is able to be both the provider and operator for some games? They openly will say that they are the provider for games they call "bitstarz originals". If true that would mean they are in full control of the game and they also are the operator of it. If it is a white label situation they refuse to disclose it when directly asked. When issues come up that they normally would contact the provider, they instead say their internal team will have to look into it.</p>
<p>Seems like this should invalidate their license but wanted to see if anyone knew more about this.</p>
<p>Below is the info they have posted on their site about these games.</p>
<p>BITSTARZ ORIGINALS</p>
<p>Netflix and Disney have their originals, so why shouldn’t we?</p>
<p>For the longest time, we’ve brought you the latest casino releases, and now and then we’ve also given you the chance to try exclusive games from the best game studios in the world.</p>
<p>So what’s the next step? Well, creating our very own games of course. These will go under the name "BitStarz Originals". By BitStarz, for BitStarz players.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE BITSTARZ ORIGINALS?</p>
<p>We’ve always seen ourselves as a small boutique casino, and without sounding like hipsters, all we mean is that we like to keep close relationships with our players. We’re not Wal-Mart, we’re your corner shop.</p>
<p>Because of that close relationship we get a lot of great feedback from players such as yourself, and it’s not like those suggestions get shredded and re-purposed as confetti at the next office party. We listen, and we improve.</p>
<p>By now, we think we have a pretty good idea of what our players like, so it felt right to create our own line of games. If you feel we got it all wrong, or if there are things we can improve on, please let us know and maybe your idea will make it into a real slot one day.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the prize-packed Blackjack and Plinko, or the perfect pick-up and play choices in Dice and Crash, BitStarz Originals has something for everyone!</p>
<p>WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM A BITSTARZ ORIGINALS GAME?</p>
<p>We’ve always been about quality, rather than quantity, and the same will go for our very own games. In other words, we wouldn’t release anything we wouldn’t think you’d like.</p>
<p>With that said, everyone is different, so we’ll make sure to have a great mix of themes and mechanics so you can find a BitStarz Original that suits your style of play and taste.</p>
<p>BITSTARZ ORIGINALS HAVE ARRIVED!</p>
<p>It might be presumptuous of us, but as you’re playing here at BitStarz we figured you’re already a fan of our site and what we provide. So why should our games be any different?</p>
<p>Well, this is all talk and there’s a way to find out once and for all. So try them out, let us know what you think, and always remember to dream big and win bigger!</p>
