<p>Melbourne-based creator of large-scale consumer engagement products GTG Network announced two new partnership deals, with casino operators Caesars Entertainment and Penn National Gaming. Under the new partnerships, Caesars will launch its free to play Pro Football Pick’em online game, while Penn National will utilize GTG’s iSport Genius data driven content and insights for sports bettors to support the launch of its Barstool sports book app.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment and Fantasy Games</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s new product, the free to play football game, will offer its Rewards customers the chance to compete for cash prizes each week of the upcoming football season, by picking correctly the outcome of all Sunday and Monday games from the National Football League (NFL). Besides the Pro Football Pick’em online game, GTG, as part of their collaboration, developed another fantasy game for Caesars’ VIP members.</p>
<p>“GTG Network continues to be our partner of choice for free to play games. They have once again demonstrated an ability to deliver market leading products, working closely with us to customize solutions specific to our needs. With digital engagement more important than ever, we couldn’t be more delighted to expand our relationship.” Josh Margolis, Vice President, Loyalty and Digital Products, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Nathan Rothschild, a co-founder and partner of GTG Network, expressed his excitement from deepening the on-going relationship with Caesars, which enhanced GTG’s vision of how sports fans engage with their favourite sports.</p>
<p>Penn National and Sports Betting</p>
<p>The deal between GTG Network and Penn National Gaming will ensure data insight from GTG’s iSport Genius product be supplied to the casino operator as it prepares to launch its Barstool sports book app. According to the terms of the deal, GTG will deploy its product in all states where Penn launches its sports betting app.</p>
<p>“We seek to build fun, engaging, and unique sports betting and gaming product experiences, and the iSG data product complements that strategy. We are excited to be partnered with GTG Network, and look forward to utilizing their services as we scale the Barstool Sportsbook product across the US.” Jon Kaplowitz, Head, Penn Interactive</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is set to become the first state where Penn will go live with its mobile sports book app, with the launch scheduled to follow the approved by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board test period, September 15 to September 17, subject to final regulatory approvals. Penn expects to roll out the Barstool sports book app in other states in the coming months.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce further growth in the U.S. by partnering with Penn National, the nation’s largest regional gaming operator. Like everyone else, we expect the Barstool Sportsbook app to make a significant impact in the US sports betting sector. We have been working closely with the team at Penn National and are excited to be a part of their Barstool Sportsbook product.” Nathan Rothschild, C0-founder and Partner, GTG Network</p>
<p>The deals with Caesars and Penn significantly boost the US position of Australian-based GTG Network on its most important international market.</p>
