<p>On Air Entertainment Confident about Future Products Success</p>
<p>On Air Entertainment already has a strong base of operation in Riga, Latvia, and it’s focused on English language tables for the time being. The company expects to have 20 tables all set up by the end of the year, allowing it to cater to a growing number of blackjack-hungry players.</p>
<p>The company is also committed to making the integration as clear-cut as possible without any hidden fees. On Air managing director Andres Rengifo commented on the launch:</p>
<p>“We set out with ambitious plans to bring a brand-new studio and a premium live casino product to the table in less than a year and have succeeded in doing just that – an incredible achievement for our business. It’s thanks to the unstoppable drive, passion and unity our talented team has shown that we have accomplished in just 11 months what has taken other years to achieve!” On Air managing director Andres Rengifo</p>
<p>On Air expects to add support for other languages as well and it has already obtained regulatory approvals from the Malta Gaming Authority, Isle of Man and Latvia, embarking on a big number of potential geographical regions from the very start. Global expansion is also part of the company’s plans in the coming months.</p>
<p>The studio features 200 employees who bring unique expertise to the table and the recruitment drive continues to feed four operational hubs. The company has plans to release several classics in 2022 as it continues to build up on the momentum of 2021, Rengifo concluded.</p>
