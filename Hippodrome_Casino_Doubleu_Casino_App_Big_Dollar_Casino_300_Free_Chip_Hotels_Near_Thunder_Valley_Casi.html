<p>The PGA Tour has revealed two new partnerships designed to help the company improve its overall integrity commitment. The company has agreed to extend its relationship with Genius Sports, a sports data, tech, and integrity specialist, which will now help the organization to further strengthen its safeguards against betting fraud and corruption in the sport.</p>
<p>This comes as part of the PGA Tour’s Integrity Program, and it is an attempt to ensure that the sport continues to generate interest among sports bettors, who have been flocking to golf since sports wagering became legal in the United States in 2018.</p>
<p>The company has also minted a brand new partnership with US Integrity, another integrity heavyweight in the sports betting market in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, US Integrity CEO and co-founder Matthew Holt hailed the opportunity to work with a preeminent partner such as PGA Tour and explained what this meant for his company, but also for the future of golf in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>"We are looking forward to working with the premier golf tour in the world, featuring the biggest names," Holt stated. He further said that his company was capable to ensure sports betting integrity and improve the overall measures put in place to protect against manipulation in the sport.</p>
<p>PGA Tour VP of Gaming Scott Warfield was equally effusive about the opportunities revealed therein as well. The two companies that now serve as guarantors of PGA’s events and tours will play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the sport across all competitions hosted by the organization, Warfield explained.</p>
<p>Genius Sports will continue to be the leading partnership, with US Integrity joining with supplementary but equally important monitoring services. The companies will focus on discovering irregular contests by monitoring performance and sports betting markets across numerous data sets. US Integrity previously teamed up with UFC.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Head of Integrity Partnerships Stephen Thurley was similarly pleased to continue this long-standing relationship with a prominent partner, adding that his company will seek to unfaltering ensure the safety of the sport and organization.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to extend our historic partnership with the PGA TOUR. As the sports betting landscape rapidly evolves across the US," Thurley added. PGA Tour’s Integrity Program is dedicated to ensuring that the organization runs a comprehensive integrity service that allows it to root out any corruption from its sport.</p>
<p>The sustained interest in sports betting on golfing events has made the organization aware of the fact that in order to enjoy this lasting interest, the PGA Tour would have to ensure that its events are free of any manipulation.</p>
