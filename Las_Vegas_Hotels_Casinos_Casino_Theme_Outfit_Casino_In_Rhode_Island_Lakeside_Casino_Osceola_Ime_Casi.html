<p>App Launches in Iowa</p>
<p>Leading US sportsbook operator William Hill US has launched its enhanced popular sports betting service in Iowa. The service is available both as a mobile version for Android and Apple, as well as a website version. Players can sign up and begin their betting experience through either version.</p>
<p>The app is designed with the user in mind. It focuses on usability, flexibility and freedom of betting and offers a large selection of markets and sports betting opportunities. The registration process is secure, quick and streamlined so eager players can jump in almost immediately.</p>
<p>The app also includes a wide variety of ways to deposit and withdraw funds. This includes through debit cards, online banking, eChecks, Paypal and with William Hill’s prepaid Play+ card. Furthermore, players can also cash out their winnings at any of William Hill’s retail sports books across the state.</p>
<p>Currently, the company operates retail stores in six casinos within the state: Harrah’s Council Bluffs, Horseshoe Council Bluffs, Isle Casino Hotel Bettendorf, Isle Casino Hotel Waterloo, Lakeside Hotel &amp; Casino, and Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Year of Growth</p>
<p>William Hill’s sports betting app also recently launched in Washington D.C, featuring the same experience and payment flexibility. Altogether, the app is now available in a total of 8 US states – Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>William Hill has been on a rapid expansion path this year, not just in the US but across the globe. The company recently acquired Alfabet to enter the growing Colombian market. It also launched a new service in Latvia with the goal of doubling its current online betting market share in the country.</p>
<p>The company’s strong global growth is complemented by the potential $3.7 billion takeover by Caesars Entertainment. On Monday, the operator announced that its takeover bid had successfully cleared the US antitrust review.</p>
