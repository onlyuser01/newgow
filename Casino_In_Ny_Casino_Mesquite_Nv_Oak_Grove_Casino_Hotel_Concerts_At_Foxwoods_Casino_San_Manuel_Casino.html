<p>Following Brian Payne’s leading performance on Day 1a of the 2013 Aussie Millions Poker Championship Main Event, which saw him finish the day with 299,900 chips, it was Frank Rusnak who shone brightly and came out victorious after Day 1b of the tournament’s Main Event.</p>
<p>Payne beat out the competition on Day 1a with aggressive tactics, ensuring that his presence was noticed as often as possible throughout the event as other players watched his chip stack grow. The 2012 Aussie Millions Main Event champion, Oliver Speidel, and the 2011 champion, David Gorr, were both casualties of Day 1a, causing some upset amongst their supporters.</p>
<p>Entry to day 1a saw a total of 157 players enlist in the tournament, which increased to 196 entries to Day 1b, bringing the total across both days to 353 players; an increase of 13 when compared to the same tally at last year’s Aussie Millions Main Event.</p>
<p>Rusnak’s impressive play on Day 1b saw him take the lead against the likes of 2010 Aussie Millions Main Event winner, Tyron Krost, Neil Channing and Jason Mercier, all of whom survived the event despite falling behind Rusnak. Igor Kurganov is also amongst those who have progressed to Day 2, which is due to commence on Wednesday January 30th.</p>
<p>The results were not all as expected, as local favourites Joel Feldman and Kristian Lunardi were both eliminated from the tournament towards the end of play, dashing the hopes of local supporters.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Vanessa Selbst, who was excited to take part in this year’s Aussie Millions, suffered a slow performance and was unable to progress to Day 2 of the Main Event. The same could be said of Phillipp Gruissem, Niklas Heinecker and Fabian Quoss, all of whom were prevented from moving along in the tournament.</p>
<p>Going into Day 1c, the final stage of Day 1, the excitement had heated up and the pressure was building on these talented players as the event reportedly saw a staggering 269 entrants.</p>
<p>By the end of Day 1c, it was Patrik Antonius who was riding high after a victorious a 204,800 chip stack after seven 90-minute levels of play.</p>
<p>Day 1c also saw Australian cricket superstar Shane Warne compete to the best of his abilities, as would be expected from the sporting hero who made it to level five of the day’s events. Other notable eliminations of the day included Brendon Rubie, Steven Gee, Masa Kagawa and John Juanda.</p>
<p>Also amongst those who survived Day 1c to go on to compete in Day 2, was the 2011 Aussie Millions $100,000 Challenge winner Sam Trickett and 2012 World Series Of Poker runner-up Jesse Sylvia. Both of these skilled and proven poker players will be competing alongside some poker greats like Jason Mercier, Phillip Willcocks and Kevin Rabichow, to name but a few of the exciting names still in the tournament.</p>
<p>Day 2, which begins Wednesday January 29th, will see the competition really heat up to a whole new level as an estimated 320 players compete for their shot at the title of the 2013 Aussie Millions Poker Championship Main Event winner.</p>
