<p>Online bookmaker and fantasy sports operator FanDuel announced a big update for its official cable television network, FanDuel TV. Viewers will soon be able to enjoy a brand new show called Run it Back, centered on all things NBA. The new content is part of FanDuel’s strategy to increase the platform’s reach and boost user engagement.</p>
<p>An Exciting Addition to a Stacked Program Lineup</p>
<p>FanDuel TV is still a relatively new project. Launching in September, it offered a novel combination of live sports coverage and sports wagering content optimized for mobile devices.</p>
<p>The media project launched with several original shows like the signature More Ways to Win hosted by FanDuel brand ambassador Lisa Kerney. Kay Adams from NFL’s Good Morning Football also joined the fantasy sports giant, heading her own morning segment. Famous sports analyst Pat McAfee also signed on to create original content for FanDuel TV. As of the writing of this article, the network is home to 17 shows covering a variety of sports and an increased focus on wagering.</p>
<p>Viewers Will See Some Familiar Faces</p>
<p>With Run it Back, FanDuel TV will cater to diehard NBA fans. NBA veteran Chandler Parsons and former ESPN star Michelle Beadle will comment on the biggest news in the league, discuss intriguing matchups and offer insight into the most anticipated games. Shams Charania, writer for The Athletic, will often join the pair to contribute interesting behind-the-scenes information and deliver breaking news.</p>
<p>Charania will also feature heavily in FanDuel TV’s betting-orientated content. According to his deal with the operator, all his social media reports will exclusively feature sportsbook odds by FanDuel. Charania will be banned from having a personal FanDuel betting account to maintain safe gambling standards and sports integrity.</p>
<p>Basketball Fans Can Expect Exciting Content</p>
<p>FanDuel CCO Mike Raffensperger offered his commentary on the new show, promising high-quality NBA coverage.</p>
<p>Every NBA season offers its own unique intrigue, and as the narrative of each season unfolds, Run it Back will be there every step of the way. Mike Raffensperger, FanDuel chief commercial officer</p>
<p>Fans can watch the new show every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at 10:00 am ET. Run it Back is produced by seasoned NBA content creator Eddie “Bansky” Gonzalez, who will also occasionally appear on air to contribute his thoughts on topics of interest.</p>
<p>With Run it Back, the FanDuel network will have a complete content package to sate the appetite of even the most fervent basketball fans. Thanks to an agreement with Sportradar, viewers can enjoy content from leagues in China, France, and Germany. FanDuel TV also made a commitment to include game coverage of Australia’s National Basketball League to provide the ultimate viewer experience.</p>
