    <h1>Wildhorse Casino In Pendleton Oregon California Casino Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Maryland Height</h1>

<p>Soft2Bet has entered the Greek gaming market with two seven-year licenses from the Hellenic Gaming Commission’s Gaming Supervision and Control Commission</p>
<p>May has been a busy month for the software solutions provider whose work has been acknowledged with numerous recognitions, awards, and shortlistings over the years.</p>
<p>At the head of the month, Soft2Bet announced it obtained a Business-to-Business license for Sweden, which it added to its previously obtained Business-to-Consumer license.</p>
<p>Now, two weeks later, Soft2Bet has announced it was granted an important betting and gaming license for the Greek market.</p>
<p>The Hellenic Gaming Commission’s Gaming Supervision and Control Commission was the one that awarded Soft2Bet with a pair of seven-year licenses for casino games and betting events in Greece.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Makes Debut on Revived Greek Gaming Market</p>
<p>From 2021 onwards, the gaming market in Greece has gone through some spectacular changes, coming back to life and opening its doors to fresh operators like Gaming Corps, Spinome, Relax Gaming, and Slotegrator.</p>
<p>Now, it is time for Soft2Bet to make its entrance and debut here with its state-of-the-art products. Speaking about the new license, group general counsel David Yatom called it a “terrific step forward” for the company.</p>
<p>Yatom added that the new remote licenses for casino gaming and sports betting were regarded as a springboard for additional expansion on “further regulated markets across Europe and around the globe”.</p>
<p>The same group general counsel also called the latest licensing success a critical step that was taken in the right direction for Soft2Bet. Soft2Bet already holds a license in Spain, Ireland, and Denmark, with the latter obtained at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Greece, a Market of “Particular Interest” for Soft2Bet</p>
<p>The company further explained its excitement to be joining the Greek market, calling it one that has “been of particular interest” to the provider and operator group since 2021.</p>
<p>One year ago, the Greek government decided to increase the €2 ($2.14) cap on online wagers along with increasing the maximum value of slots Jackpots.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet expects the freshly obtained certifications to be proof of the hard efforts work that its legal and compliance departments have put in to stay fully compliant with different regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>While continuing to issue licenses to brands that it trusts, the Hellenic Gaming Commission is also interested in promoting a safe gaming environment for domestic players. Accordingly, it introduced an anonymous tip line allowing people to report illegal gambling websites and unauthorized forms of advertisements.</p>
<p>This comes to prove the Greek market’s interest in fully acknowledging, revealing, and preventing the risks and harms related to the black gambling market.</p>
