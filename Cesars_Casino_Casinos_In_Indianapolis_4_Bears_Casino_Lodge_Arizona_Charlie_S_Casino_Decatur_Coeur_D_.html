    <h1>Cesars Casino Casinos In Indianapolis 4 Bears Casino Lodge Arizona Charlie S Casino Decatur Coeur D</h1>

<p>Super Group, the company behind prominent betting and iGaming brand Betway, has announced that it is cleared to launch in Ontario with a host of new iGaming properties. The company received a go-ahead from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) for four gaming brands, including Spin Casino, Royal Vegas, Jackpot City, and Ruby Fortune.</p>
<p>Licenses Extended to Super Group Brands</p>
<p>All four brands are owned through a subsidiary, Cadtree Limited. The licenses will be available for a period of two years and extend through June 2024. These four brands are following Betway’s successful entry into the market as early as April when the private gambling market officially opened for business.</p>
<p>Betway arrived at the end of April, but the company quickly became one of the most dominant names in both sports betting and iGaming. Part of this is owing to the company’s established footprint in both verticals even though they were officially legalized.</p>
<p>With Betway effectively becoming the 30th license holder in Ontario at the time, the addition of four new brands creates more healthy competition in the market and a unique twist to the experience. Super Group is not too worried about adding more of its brands either, as the iGaming market in the province is set to be the biggest in North America by numerous estimates.</p>
<p>North American iGaming Market Compels Brands to Go All-in</p>
<p>Super Group first announced its pivot towards the regulated gambling market in North America in 2021 when the company sought to break ground in the United States. It has been widely successful, with the northward expansion today signaling overall confidence in the prospects of both Canada and the United States in terms of iGaming momentum.</p>
<p>Super Group also posted steady financial results. The company said that its first-quarter revenue came to about $344.5 million, although not all brands have been performing too well over the period. Spin Casino for example saw a small dip in revenue.</p>
