<p>Rush Street Interactive says that its new slots tournament will be the best one Michigan players have ever seen</p>
<p>Online casino and sports betting operator Rush Street Interactive has unveiled what it calls “the most exciting online slot tournament in Michigan history.” The so-called BetRivers Michigan Million Online Slot Tournament will provide slot aficionados with a shot at various exciting prizes.</p>
<p>BeRivers Michigan Million players will get to play slots and earn points for their successes. Each successful spin will help players accumulate more points and rise above their peers. The best players will secure positions in the next round of tournament play, RSI explained.</p>
<p>To qualify for a chance to win $1 million in bonus money, players need to visit BetRivers.com from April 1 to 30. Then, they must make a single deposit of $50+ using the code “MILLION” into their BetRivers account. At that point, players will be awarded 100 Tournament Spins that they should use smartly before April 30. Depending on their performance, players can secure additional spins.</p>
<p>The top 400 players from the qualifying round will advance to the semi-final round. Then, each of these players will be awarded another 200 Tournament Spins that they can use between May 5 and 6. Only the top 10 players will advance to the finals but everyone who failed to qualify will receive $1,500 in bonus money.</p>
<p>The final round of the tournament will take place live on May 15. The 10 participants will have 10 minutes and unlimited spins. The luckiest player will receive the $100,000 bonus money grand prize, while the other two will each win $35,000 in bonus money.</p>
<p>John Mason Will Join RSI for the Event</p>
<p>RSI also noted that John Mason, a Detroit radio host and public address announcer for the Detroit Pistons, will once again join the BetRivers team. Mason, who placed the first-ever legal bet on BetRivers.com, will help the operator make the tournament even more exciting.</p>
<p>Mason said that Michigan players have never seen anything quite like this slot tournament. He added that he is excited to be a part of this thrilling event.</p>
<p>I’ve been connected to the brand since the launch and am thrilled to be part of the BetRivers Michigan Million Online Slot Tournament. I can’t wait to see 400 Michiganders win their share of the $1 million bonus money prize pool. John Mason</p>
<p>Richard Schwartz, RSI’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter. He said that his team is looking forward to hosting the most exciting online slots tournament Michigan has ever seen.</p>
