<p>Gates of Olympus review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves at the entrance to the realm of the Gods, Olympus. An ominous Zeus hovers at the gate, daring those who approach to be worthy.</p>
<p>Up against reels of precious gems and mysterious artifacts, players will face a trial to enter the heavenly kingdom. The violet sky seems temptingly just beyond the gates.</p>
<p>This slot has an epic mood and lots of mythical drama.</p>
<p>Sensational big win in the Gates of Olympus slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation style has a video game aesthetic and this adds to players’ sense that they are on trial.</p>
<p>The colour palette is filled with purple, blue and gold, creating a great fantasy mood. Imposing white pillars topped with flames stand either side of the gold-framed reels.</p>
<p>The gems and other treasures make eye-catching symbols and feel satisfying to accumulate.</p>
<p>Zeus is clad in a white toga and chunky golden cuffs. His glowing green eyes and aggressive stance make it clear that players will need to impress him to get anywhere.</p>
<p>The theme music is filled with harps, bells and dark undertones. This reminds players that although they are at a heavenly gate, they haven’t gotten in just yet.</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus Gameplay</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus is a six reel, five row slot.</p>
<p>Gates of Olympus has cascade system instead of usual win lines</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing certain numbers of matching symbols anywhere on the reels, with increasing payouts for larger numbers. This effectively turns every symbol into a Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The cascade feature takes place after every spin as winning combinations pay out and then the winning symbols vanish. The symbols that are left drop to the bottom of the screen and then the empty positions are filled with fresh symbols. Players may receive unlimited cascades.</p>

<p>There is no Wild symbol in this slot.</p>

<p>There are four Multiplier symbols that may be present on all reels. Whenever a player lands a Multiplier symbol, they receive a random multiplier value from x2 to x500.</p>
<p>After the end of a cascade feature sequence, all the Multiplier symbols are added together and the total win of the sequence is multiplied by the final value.</p>
<p>Players are awarded the Free Spins feature when four or more Scatter symbols land anywhere. Players begin the round starting with 15 free spins. Whenever Multiplier symbols land during the Free Spins feature, the Multiplier value is added to the total multiplier.</p>
