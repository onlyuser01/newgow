    <h1>My Choice Casino Com Play For Real Money Casinos Doubleu Casino Free Chips Update Enchanted Sweepsta</h1>

<p>"Nevertheless, the current problem has existed for over 3 weeks, which is why a clear and official warning is definitely justified."</p>
<p>You were warned 3 months ago.</p>
<p>Blaming the guru is easy of course ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>If you had all questioned yourself, without believing everything again, you wouldn't have the problem at all today.</p>
<p>Some people have become so comfortable that they open a page, look at the page superficially for 3 minutes and register just because there is a number called a rating, although they know NOTHING about the casino and sometimes trust fake reviews , which by the way everyone can write and Guru is not a CLEARSEERING ASSOCIATION and cannot know whether the casino are representatives or real players. (Anyone can write reviews ^^)</p>
<p>You should even check out the reviews.</p>
<p>Once again you rely on others instead of questioning yourself and wondering afterwards.</p>
<p>I really don't mean that in a bad way, but I've been playing for so long and only had a problem once in 15 years.</p>
<p>How come? When I play, I don't just look at the casino, I go back to the root of it, which is why everyone here was warned 3 months ago, but a few wannabe know-it-alls have the folks who tried to warn the players also got ripped off.</p>
<p>What kind of behavior is it now to say guru is to blame for everything? ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Guru is a portal that mediates and not a CIA that has to question everything for you down to the root (fake reviews and so on)</p>
<p>You can't just hurt anybody with assumptions.</p>
<p>I think some of you didn't understand how all this works and are complaining because it's more convenient that way, even though it's each and every one of you to blame.</p>
<p>Why am I not playing there just like some others? Because they knew exactly what was going on here, since they use their brains themselves instead of giving them away and believing everything that is written.</p>
<p>And those here (everyone knows who is meant) who have been praising the casino for a while, even though they themselves knew that they were the Wild Pharaoh, the greatest hypocrites of all.</p>
<p>What you did could also be called ar... crawling.</p>
<p>Write politely here in the chat and give good comments because they believed that they would have more chances and now that they also realized what we said 3 months ago, they changed their behavior and became abusive and negative towards the casino.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>I won't say anything more on this subject.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for some &amp; some others here, I think they all know which people are meant here, that's what happens when you think you know everything and have to fool others.</p>
<p>To some, my sincere disappointment that they stole so much time and nerves from you &amp; to the other hypocrites, howl softly.</p>
<p>You were warned, you saw that warning and ignored it.</p>
<p>Now blame Guru or some me because I already exposed the criminal casino 3 months ago and they claimed it was my fault why players didn't get paid or whatever bullshit is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Too many people here in this forum who conveniently blame others because life is easier that way ^^</p>
<p>Guru is NOT to blame at all!</p>
<p>For example, if I open a casino and copy that casino from others so that my casino resembles another one or several that may have bad reviews, the Guru team CANNOT rate my casino equally bad as they don't know anything about me &amp; they know thousands of others Casinos have things you need to scrutinize.</p>
<p>It's your job!</p>
<p>EXACTLY that's why it ALWAYS says "It's a fresh casino and ZEIT will show what ranking it will get" that's how it works with new casinos.</p>
<p>The Lawyer explained this very well here.</p>
<p>Wait and see how the casinos fare and then play there.</p>
<p>Jump on the train without knowing where it's going and then get upset with the conductor ^^</p>
<p>Find the blame in yourself.</p>
<p>That only goes to the cool ones here who know everything and end up blaming others.</p>
