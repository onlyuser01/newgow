<p>The latest certification helps the company grow its global footprint and deliver its engaging games to new customers</p>
<p>The leading provider of skill and fast games, Galaxsys, confirmed it continues to expand the reach of its engaging content by securing certification for two important markets. The company revealed Tuesday it successfully secured certification for its games for the regulated gambling market in Greece and Colombia.</p>
<p>As a result, Galaxsys’ Crasher and F Mines titles were certified for the Greek Market. Additionally, the company’s Crash, Rocketon, Crasher and Cash Show games secured certification and are now available in Colombia, an important jurisdiction in Latin America that holds significant potential.</p>
<p>By expanding the certification and reach of its games, Galaxsys can benefit from new growth opportunities. What’s more, securing licenses in new jurisdictions enables the company to deliver its engaging and thrilling games to new audiences, expanding further its global footprint.</p>
<p>The latest certification in Colombia and Greece complements Galaxsys’ growth. At the same time, the company already has a growing footprint on the Old Continent and in Latin America, where its popular crash, mines, instant and Plinko games have already captured the attention of many players.</p>
<p>Back in June, Galaxsys released details regarding Lighting Bonus and Leaderboard, two new player engagement features that deliver exciting experiences for the company’s growing customer base. The launch of the new features is expected to increase customer engagement and retention while bringing thrilling experiences for the players.</p>
<p>The Certification Brings Excitement to Galaxsys</p>
<p>Gil Soffer, Galaxsys’ SVP of sales and business development, revealed that the company is delighted to see its instant, crash, mines and other popular skill and fast games secure certification in Greece and Columbia. “These two jurisdictions are now part of a long list of regulated markets in Europe, LATAM, and Africa, where our games are available,” he added.</p>
<p>Soffer spoke about Galaxsys’ future expansion, explaining that the company focuses on strategic regions such as Latin America, as well as Asia, where incredible growth opportunities await. Finally, the SVP of sales and business development thanked the regulators for awarding the licenses and allowing Galaxsys to continue growing and deliver games to new customers.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that our crash, Plinko, mines, instant, and other fast and skill games are certified in Colombia and Greece.“ Gil Soffer, SVP of sales and business development at Galaxsys</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes on the heels of another important achievement for Galaxsys. Back in June, the leading provider of games revealed that it joined forces with QTech Games for a new Asian-facing deal.</p>
