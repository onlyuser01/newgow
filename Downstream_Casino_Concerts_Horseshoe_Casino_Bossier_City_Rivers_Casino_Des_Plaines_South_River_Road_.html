    <h1>Downstream Casino Concerts Horseshoe Casino Bossier City Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road</h1>

<p>The Royal Ascot has turned out to be a major success for betting operators and the company providing ancillary infrastructure</p>
<p>The horse racing event has been hailed as a success by FSB as well, a global sports betting platform provider, which saw a 42% increase in the platform revenue over the five days of the actual event this year. There was a 90% jump in the number of players engaging with the event and a 39% increase in bet numbers.</p>
<p>FSB Drives Steady Results During Royal Ascot</p>
<p>FSB has been providing its platform solutions for a number of established companies, including Fitzdares and Bet Goodwin which have benefited from the streamlined and uninterrupted experience which has translated into excellent performance under the stewardship of FSB CEO Adam Smith.</p>
<p>During events such as the Royal Ascot, it’s not uncommon for platforms to short-circuit and significantly diminish the potential sports betting handle that would have been collected otherwise. FSB is an award-winning multi-channel supplier that has been able to guarantee that none of this is actually going to be the case.</p>
<p>FSB sportsbook and trading director Mark Wilson spoke highly of the most recent results and what they meant for the company. He hailed the strong performance and the sustained interest in the event, a milestone that FSB undoubtedly contributed to.</p>
<p>“Following on from our record-breaking Cheltenham Festival performance in March, these results cement our position as the leading platform provider for horse racing-focused operators,” said hopeful of the future of FSB and what it may bring next.</p>
<p>In the meantime, FSB has been busy and developing its footprint in global markets, strengthening its position in numerous markets across Europe Africa and North America. FSB has been hailed as a reliable stack provider for some of the leading companies around the world.</p>
<p>FSB’s march in North America has been paced with the company choosing to focus on Ontario in Canada first over the United States. However, FSB is determined to push down across the border in what is one of the most vibrant legal betting markets.</p>
