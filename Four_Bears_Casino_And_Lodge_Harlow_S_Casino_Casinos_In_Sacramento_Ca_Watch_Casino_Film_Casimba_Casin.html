    <h1>Four Bears Casino And Lodge Harlow S Casino Casinos In Sacramento Ca Watch Casino Film Casimba Casin</h1>

<p>Dear Eduardo,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I hope I understood your query correctly and you wish to close your account.</p>
<p>Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account’s closure. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.enzocasino.com/general-terms-conditions/?lang=en:</p>
<p>„ Account Closure</p>
<p>. You are entitled to close your Account and terminate this Agreement at any time by contacting Support using the Contact Us page in the Help Center, or via email, and we will respond within a reasonable time. You will be responsible for activity on the Account until the closure has been finalized by us."</p>
<p>"Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>. For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide voluntary self-exclusion tools, which enable you to close your account or restrict your ability to place bets. If you require any information relating to this facility please contact Customer Support.</p>
<p>. We will endeavor to implement your request within a reasonable time period and to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling before your request has been implemented or you seek to use the Website and we fail to recognize or determine that.</p>
<p>. You acknowledge that exclusion and limits are set per account, and should you have accounts on more than one site owned by us, you must set the limits on each account."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email to support@enzocasino.com, stating your user name and a request to close your account. Don’t forget to mention your reasons and a period for which you wish your account to remain closed. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
