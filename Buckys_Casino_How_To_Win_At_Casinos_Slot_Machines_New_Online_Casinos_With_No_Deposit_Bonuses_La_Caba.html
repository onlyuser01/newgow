    <h1>Buckys Casino How To Win At Casinos Slot Machines New Online Casinos With No Deposit Bonuses La Caba</h1>

<p>I played with no deposit bonus money of 300$ and met the wager requirements of 9000$.. I’m now at 188 ,980$ wagering.. made first withdrawal after submitting kyc documents a week prior.. withdrawal of 500 to my discover acct via wire transfer.. requested 1/12/21.. processed 1/14/21 23:57pm. Discover bank has no pending and cannot locate any transaction at all.. I made another withdrawal request on 1/18/21of 500$ successful and processed 1/20/21.. again wired to discover acct.. contacted chat customer service.. was told they are NOT processing anything besides Bitcoin transactions for withdrawals.. I asked where is the 1000$ from these 2 transactions? And got no answer.. was told that since wagering requirements were met ( and then way some) that they would take their initial 300$ bo us back that was given, which is fine.. but every time I ask where is my money.. I get nothing.. and told something different every single time.. " you can only withdrawal 100$ on bonus" we process payments Tuesday’s and Thursday’s.. I was advised to get a Bitcoin wallet for smooth withdrawal transactions going forward.. I spent hours researching as I do not know anything of Bitcoin.. i got a wallet app.. I made a third withdrawal request for 500 to my Bitcoin wallet address.. and it says once again success and continuing to shows up under my history-transactions- payments .. this 1500$ total has been deducted from my casino acct and when I ask for wire transfer tracking numbers .. I get no answer.. my Bitcoin wallet is still empty.. what do I do?? I have over 5400$ in that acct and need to be able to withdrawal even if it is only 2000$ a month -500$ weekly.. this cannot be legal to embezzle money from my account.. and if they were only processing Bitcoin transactions..1) why was transaction processed and why did it say it was successful</p>
<p>2) why can’t they give me a tracking number or identifying information on said wire transfer for my bank to find ??</p>
<p>3) why was I not told they are not processing wire transfers at this time only to expect money that ultimately they ended up keep and defrauding me out if ..</p>
<p>4) how can a casino expect guests to trust and deposit to play at their casino when they cannot even be honest about giving legit winnings and all requirements met by guest?</p>
<p>I have read in order to defraud or get out of paying guests winnings this casino on more than one occasion to more than one guest said the guest has a duplicate acct and the casino chose to shut down accounts although it was not true .. this is merely a way to steal money online from people. Whole time they are lying . Telling customers different stories when it comes to rules.. and when they cannot get a customer on a legitimate " offense" they either create an duplicate account in that players name to be able to justify not having to pay them the winnings they won.. they do not understand hours and hours are invested in playing and winning.. to end up like this..</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion my account will be terminated for this exact reason or I’d bet one reason very close to it.. I’d like to be able to get my money..</p>
