<p>Hurricane Global’s Brand – DuxCasino Launches Relax Gaming Content</p>
<p>B2B iGaming provider and innovative gaming solutions aggregator, Relax Gaming, has launched its content for Hurricane Global Group’s online casino brand. Announced on Friday this week, Hurricane is now going to be able to offer top-quality content by Relax Gaming for DuxCasino. The titles launched include the highly popular Temple Tumble, Snake Arena, and Money Train 2.</p>
<p>“The diversity of brands we partner with is testament to the variety of content offered through our platform and our ability to meet the needs of international operators like Hurricane Global through localisation and quality.” Daniel Eskola, CCO, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the agreement, the brand’s players are also going to be able to enjoy an extensive range of content with popular titles from Big Time Gaming, ReelPlay, and 4ThePlayer, as well as many other third-party games through Relax Gaming’s platform.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Increases Global Market Presence</p>
<p>The recent launch of content for Hurricane Global Group which operates in multiple jurisdictions worldwide is another step of Relax Gaming’s continuous expansion. Only recently, Relax has significantly expanded its customer base and increased its global reach with top-operators over multiple markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s Chief Commercial Officer, Daniel Eskola, said that it is great to work with a “like-minded” and ambitious operator with global influence such as Hurricane Global. He added that the company will continue to expand its presence in regulated markets worldwide.</p>
<p>“The major draw of Relax’s portfolio is the choice it offers players and the speed at which we have been able to integrate a huge variety of quality games that have wide-ranging appeal,” reads a statement by Hurricane Global Group.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hurricane Global said that Relax Gaming’s approach to business and integration has been close to flawless. Consequently, the company is looking forward to a strong partnership that will bring both companies continued commercial value.</p>
<p>Clearly, Relax Gaming will continue expanding its presence, as only recently, the company inked a similar agreement with Greentube, Novomatic’s interactive division. Under the partnership agreement, the operator agreed to offer exclusive gaming content across regulated European markets.</p>
