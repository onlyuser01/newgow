<p>Winter Berries 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Winter Berries 2 is themed around a world filled with berries.</p>
<p>Players will wander across a wintery landscape until they find an enchanted tree filled with berries. They’ll need to collect as many of these colorful treats as possible as spring returns to the land.</p>
<p>Fans of fruit machines may particularly enjoy this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Winter Berries 2 is an ethereal melody that brings to mind a ballet. The tune picks up during spins and wins are accentuated with chiming.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will discover a variety of berries, including raspberries, gooseberries, blueberries, and salmon berries. Each of these little fruits is animated in a vivid style that may remind players of the illustrations of a children’s book.</p>
<p>The reels are held in the branches of a small tree, as if all the berries are growing on its branches. To the left of the tree, players will see snow, but to the right of the tree there is lush green grass and flowers blooming. This suggests the transition between spring and winter, making this setting especially magical.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation create a dreamy natural world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Winter Berries 2 is a five-reel, three-row slot. However, there is a sixth reel that can be unlocked by activating the Golden Bet option. This will also increase the player’s bet by 1.5x and double their odds of triggering the Free Spins feature. Players will also have access to 6-of-a-kind wins which permits the highest multipliers available.</p>
<p>There are 20 win lines in total.</p>
<p>The pace of the gameplay is somewhat slower, adding to the fanciful atmosphere. However, this may make this slot less engaging for some players.</p>
<p>Players can buy directly into the Free Spins feature by selecting the Buy Bonus option.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Freezing Respins feature begins on any spin, with winning symbols becoming sticky and remaining on the reels. If players land additional wins, those winning symbols will also become ‘frozen’ on the reels. The feature continues as long as there are new winning combinations.</p>
<p>If players land at least 3 Scatters during the base game, the Free Spins feature begins and the Scatters are ‘frozen’ on the reels. The number of free spins awarded depends on the number of triggering Scatters:</p>
<p>Above each of the reels, multipliers are displayed. If players fill consecutive reels with ‘frozen’ symbols from left to right, the corresponding multipliers are applied to the player’s wins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, all multipliers are doubled. If players land a Special Scatter symbol, every multiplier is increased by +15. Landing additional Scatters awards additional free spins, and continues to increase the multiplier values without limit.</p>
