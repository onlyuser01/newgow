<p>Hi Nick</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>Yes the account is already verified and I sent my kyc details and bank statement for verification. It was verified on 10th March 2023, on same day I deposited 5k, 15k and 20k to Jeetplay account and played in Pragmatic live game called Megawheel. I accumulated winnings through Real money and I dint take any bonus or free spin. The deposits of 5k, 15k and 20k was deposited from my own savings account. Since my wife was a home maker, we wanted a secondary income so we created her account. I sent 15k to her account as she doesn't have any source of income. She deposited 10k from her bank account. Which was not added and I had to take her credentials and crosschecked with Jeetplay, they termed it as illegal and on same day 14th March they asked for my wife bank statement and I sent that. They blocked her account and they added that money 10k to my account. They said on grounds of good conduct they added me that money. So in that way we never used wife account to play. They have only chat support and email , I asked them in website help chat asking my withdrawl of 49k is on hold in addition to 19,50 000 already in Real balance. They said finance team will update. Evening around 4pm today I see my account being blocked and email sent saying my account being blocked.</p>
<p>Yes we created multiple account but they termed illegal and blocked on 14th. They added that money to my account. I started playing and my account was active till this afternoon. If it was illegal on 14th March they could block even my account. Post that also from my winning balance which I had approx around 3 lacs and above still they were crediting to my account. Since last 3 days my balance was accumulated to 19,50,000 that's when they blocked. So sir please advise why they blocked after 6 days from my wife's account being blocked. Say if it was to crosscheck then y were they crediting daily limit withdrawl amount. This is purely just a reason to confiscate all my hard earned winnings. I swear I never cheated or done any fraud. I will be thankful if you could help me with this issues. Thank you for all your help.</p>
