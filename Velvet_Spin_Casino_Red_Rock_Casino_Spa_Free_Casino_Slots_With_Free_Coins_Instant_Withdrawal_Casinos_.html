    <h1>Velvet Spin Casino Red Rock Casino Spa Free Casino Slots With Free Coins Instant Withdrawal Casinos</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming solutions provider has teamed up with the distributor of games to strengthen the products it brings to its partner casinos</p>
<p>Soft2Bet will benefit from SlotMatrix’s increasingly diverse and exciting game portfolio, which features titles from Armadillo Studios, and a number of SlotMatrix Exclusive Partners. As this list is growing, operators using Soft2Bet’s platform solutions will have ready access to some of the world’s finest online casino games.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Boosts Content at Partner Operators with SlotMatrix</p>
<p>Armadillo Studios is one of the premier game developers in iGaming, part of EveryMatrix Group, and an established in-house studio that produces highly-original and well-received products. The B2B aggregation solution, SlotMatrix, allows for Armadillo Studios’ titles and those of third-party partners – referred to as Exclusive Partners by EveryMatrix, to offer their products to a large swathe of operators with a global presence.</p>
<p>This way operators tap into a robust library of games and opportunities to elevate the experience for their player bases. EveryMatrix CEO of Games Razvan Haiduc welcomed this particular opportunity and said:</p>
<p>Working with Soft2Bet will enable us to expand our reach, ensuring more customers in important markets have access to the games we have to offer from both studios. EveryMatrix CEO of Games Razvan Haiduc</p>
<p>Soft2Bet director of gaming and business development Daniel Mitton was excited about this partnership as well. He argued that his company will be as a result integrating a range of titles that stand out by virtue of their quality and the level of enjoyment they add to the player’s experience.</p>
<p>Aggregation as a Way to Elicit Stronger Results</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EveryMatrix’s aggregator has been entering new jurisdictions as it expanded in Bulgaria in May, receiving an official go-ahead from the state regulator. The company has also been actively adding more titles as well, including Hub88 and Rogue.</p>
<p>On balance, SlotMatrix is fast catching up to other major aggregators, offering thousands of games, and focusing on in-house as well as third-party games to create strong experiences for consumers and partner operators.</p>
<p>Aggregators have become very powerful solutions over the last years, allowing operators that are fairly new to quickly establish a strong foothold. SlotMatrix is one of the fastest-growing ones, along with REEVO and Pariplay’s Fusion.</p>
