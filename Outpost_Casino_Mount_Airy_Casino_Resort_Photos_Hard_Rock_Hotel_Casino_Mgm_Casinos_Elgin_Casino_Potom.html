<p>The Potomac Winter Poker Open will once again return at the MGM National Harbor between 14-26 February for another spectacular edition packing excellent events and a guaranteed prize pool of $1 million</p>
<p>At the end of lengthy consultations that saw MGM National Harbor’s employees unanimously decide to join the democratic labor union Teamsters Local 639 that represents workers in Virginia, Washington DC, and Maryland, the casino hotel is ready to once again host the much-anticipated Potomac Winter Poker Open.</p>
<p>The iconic poker tournament will be hosted at the same venue in National Harbor, Maryland, outside of Washington, DC between February 14-26.</p>
<p>Spectacular Line-up of Events Scheduled</p>
<p>The 13-day event will introduce participants to a series of excellent events with lucrative prizes. The list includes the NHL High Roller, the Monumental Stack, and the Triple Stack No-Limit Hold’Em.</p>
<p>As expected, one of the main highlights will be the Opener, which will feature a $750,000 guarantee, along with the $3,500 High Roller contest and, of course, the Main Event with a guaranteed prize pool of $1 million.</p>
<p>Other events scheduled to take place during the two weeks are the Rookies’ Event, the 5-Card Pot-Limit Omaha High, the Cakes Classic Bounty, and the Seniors 50+ event.</p>
<p>PokerOrg Covering the Borgata Winter Poker Open</p>
<p>Scheduled for January 2-25, the Borgata Winter Poker Open will host 40 events in total including 22 main events facilitated by BetMGM Poker.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recently inked agreement with the poker news outlet PokerOrg, the poker tournament with a guaranteed prize of $10 million will benefit from full Instant Live feeds, social media highlights, insights, and player narratives throughout a variety of social platforms.</p>
<p>As explained by BetMGN Poker’s director, Luke Staudenmaier, the PokerOrg coverage will help amplify players’ stories across the 22 trophy events, bringing them to life.</p>
<p>The media outlet is well-known for its unique and innovative style of reporting news in the iGaming industry in a manner that makes them truly stand out.</p>
<p>The tournament will be initiated by the Kick Off Deep Stack Event with a massive $2,000,000 in guaranteed prizes and it will also include the Saturday Series with $100,000 guaranteed, Seniors’ (50+) Championship Event with $50,000 in guaranteed prizes, the Almighty Million Event with $1,000,000 guaranteed, and the $1,000 Knock Out Bounty Event featuring $100,000 guaranteed, among others.</p>
<p>Staudenmaier also described the January Poker Open as “the start of a thrilling year of omnichannel poker events ahead.”</p>
<p>Last November, New Jersey’s Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa said they would make a comeback to the Borgata Winter Poker Open.</p>
