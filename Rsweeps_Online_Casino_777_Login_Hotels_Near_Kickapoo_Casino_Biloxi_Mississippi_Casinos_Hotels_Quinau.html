<p>Wisdom of Athena Delivers Thrilling Features</p>
<p>As noted, Pragmatic’s new game offers the popular tumble feature. This innovative functionality removes winning combinations from the game after a spin, bringing new symbols in their place, granting options for subsequent wins. Additionally, tumbles help uncover an additional reel, taking the player experience to a new level.</p>
<p>Besides the tumble feature, Wisdom of Athena offers scatter symbols that can help trigger free spins. Whenever a tumble explodes, scatter symbols remain on the reels and players need to have four or more such symbols to trigger free spins round with 10 spins.</p>
<p>In addition to free spins, online players can also tap into special multiplier symbols. Such symbols can drop during the base game, as well as free spins round, unlocking the potential for a multiplier between 2x and 500x.</p>
