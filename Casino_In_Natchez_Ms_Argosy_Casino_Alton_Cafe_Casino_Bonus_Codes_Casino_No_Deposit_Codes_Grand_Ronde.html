    <h1>Casino In Natchez Ms Argosy Casino Alton Cafe Casino Bonus Codes Casino No Deposit Codes Grand Ronde</h1>

<p>Good morning. I registered at rollino, and activated the 200% first deposit bonus, made the minimum deposit of 110 reais and started playing. When I completed the rollover and went to withdraw, I had to verify the account, I sent my driver's license, selfie with document and both were verified and accepted, when I went to send proof of address I had several options (bank statement, pay slip, water bills , electricity, internet, invoices...), I decided that I would send the statement from my bank (Nubank) or the invoice for the internet account (Oi provider), I didn't check that in these options I chose bank statement and invoice from internet, there was no my address, only my name and my data. So I sent a bank statement which was not accepted, then I tried to send the internet invoice, which was also not accepted. After I realized that none were being accepted, it took a lot of effort to find an invoice that showed my address, but when I went to send it there was a message in the verification area for me to contact the live chat; I contacted them and they told me to contact support via email kyc@rollino.co (they responded to me exactly now at 11:04 Brasília time, and said that it is a final decision and they cannot go back). When I went to log in to my account, there was a message that my account had been deactivated by the administrator, and they again told me to contact them via live chat and email. I ask you to please resolve my case. I confirmed my identity with the document and the selfie, they accepted it with the ✔️ sign. I ask you to please help me.</p>
