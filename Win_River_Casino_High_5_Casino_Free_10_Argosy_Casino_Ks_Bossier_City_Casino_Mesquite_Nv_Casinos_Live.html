<p>Liverpool vs. Manchester United a.k.a. the Northwest Derby is on the program on Sunday, December 17, 2023, at Anfield in Liverpool</p>
<p>Liverpool is sitting at the very top of the Premier League table, but there are two teams that can leapfrog them if they lose to Manchester United on Sunday.</p>
<p>Betting odds suggest that won’t happen, particularly because of Liverpool’s great record against Man United. The last time these two met, Liverpool won 7-0 – their biggest win over Man United in the club’s 130+ years long history.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Manchester United Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Liverpool -250 Draw +350 Manchester United +600</p>

<p>Can Liverpool Destroy Man Utd Again?</p>
<p>In the previous Liverpool vs. Manchester United game, we saw Jurgen Klopp’s men win 7-0. It was the fourth time in their last five duels that we saw the Reds obliterate the Red Devils.</p>
<p>These guys have an especially good record against this opponent in matches played at Anfield. They are without a single loss in Liverpool since January 2016. Plus, they kept a clean sheet in each of their last four duels at Anfield.</p>
<p>Speaking of their home performances, the Reds are on a 17-win streak in all competitions. They scored three or more goals in each of their last five games on home turf. The most recent of those was the game against Fulham, in which we saw them score four goals.</p>
<p>Manchester United’s Recent Form Needs to Worry Its Fans</p>
<p>The Red Devils lost two of their last three Premier League games. They lost 1-0 to Newcastle in their first game of December, then went on to beat Chelsea 2-1 at home. Finally, in their most recent game, they lost 3-0 to Bournemouth in Manchester.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing loss, especially because the Cherries were +550 underdogs before that game. Man United had the ball in its possession for more than two-thirds of the time, but they were horrible defensively.</p>
<p>Their goalkeeper Andre Onana was the worst of all the players on the pitch, with Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot, and other defenders also producing below-par performances.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>Everything seems to be going in Liverpool’s favor ahead of the duel with Manchester United. The Reds play at home, they’re in top shape, and they need points to stay at the top of the EPL standings. That said, we think that anything, but a dominant home win would be a huge upset.</p>
<p>Of course, they probably won’t destroy them 7-0 like they did the last time, but we do expect a relatively big win, with at least two or three goals in Man United’s net.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool &amp; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
