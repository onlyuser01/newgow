<p>FSB, the global business-to-business sports betting services provider, announced its entry into Nevada.</p>
<p>NGCB Awards FSB Manufacturers and Information Service Provider License</p>
<p>The company said late last week that it received license approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), the state’s gambling regulator. The manufacturers and information service provider license approval comes after the regulator’s latest public hearing and marks an important step for FSB. Now, the operator can grow within one of the most lucrative markets, the regulated gambling market in Nevada. What’s more, the license approval marks a major milestone for FSB and its overall growth within the North American region.</p>
<p>“This is a hugely satisfying moment for us all at FSB. Securing a license in Nevada was a central pillar of our long-term strategic plan for the North American region.“ Ian Freeman, Chief Revenue Officer at FSB</p>
<p>Ian Freeman, FSB’s Chief Revenue Officer, said that the licensing approval marks an exciting moment for the company. He explained that securing a license from the NGCB was one of the steps of FSB’s strategic growth plan for further expansion in the North American region. In conclusion, Freeman said that the company is looking forward to launching its services for customers in the new market.</p>
<p>“This milestone moment represents a significant step forward towards realizing our commercial goals and communicates a clear message that FSB is stepping into the No.1 global challenger brand slot in B2B sports betting,“ added Freeman</p>
<p>The License Marks a Milestone Moment for the Company</p>
<p>Dave McDowell, FSB’s CEO, added that the recent license approval marks a crucial moment for the company. He outlined that the company plans to become the go-to sports betting service provider for operators in Nevada. However, McDowell said that FSB is also planning to solidify its position in the North American market. Last but not least, he thanked the NGCB for their time and efforts.</p>
<p>“We aspire to be part of the long-term sports betting story in Nevada and look forward to embracing this market opportunity and, in the long term, aspiring to disrupt the North America region generally with our Tier 1 tech stack.“ Dave McDowell, CEO at FSB</p>
<p>Only recently, FSB was named Multi-Channel Supplier Of The Year at the 2022 EGR B2B Awards. At the time the award was received, McDowell said: “To win a hugely coveted EGR Award is a great testament to the giant global strides we’ve made as a business in the last 12 months and clearly positions FSB as one of the leading B2B sports betting and iGaming technology suppliers.” Considering its most recent achievement, the company now looks well-positioned for further growth within regulated markets.</p>
