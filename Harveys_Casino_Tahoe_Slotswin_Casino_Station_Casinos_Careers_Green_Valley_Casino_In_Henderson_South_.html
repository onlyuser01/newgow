    <h1>Harveys Casino Tahoe Slotswin Casino Station Casinos Careers Green Valley Casino In Henderson South</h1>

<p>Rank Interactive, the online division of UK-based gambling giant The Rank Group, hired Heather Kemp as the company’s new head of HR. Kemp will work for the company’s digital content-focused Gibraltar office.</p>
<p>The New Hire Is an Experienced and Versatile Professional</p>
<p>Rank Interactive’s new Head of HR is not a novice in the gambling business. Her previous occupation was with William Hill, where she rose to head of people. She was part of the management team at the company’s Gibraltar office and the UK people leadership team. Her duties included HR strategy, recruitment, employee relations, and other organizational functions.</p>
<p>In addition to her HR experience, Kemp also has a solid background in law. She graduated from the University of Hull with a Bachelor’s Degree in Law in 2010. Kemp continued her education at Cilex Law School, specializing in Employment Law and Civil Litigation. During her work with William Hill, she refined her knowledge of UK and Gibraltar Employment Law.</p>
<p>Kemp’s first job after graduating from Cilex was with British supermarket chain Asda. She initially started work as a claims team coach on risk management, insurance, and claims. After two years, the company promoted her to people insight manager. In that position, she managed HR data to improve decision-making and measure progress.</p>
<p>Kemp Joins during Rough Times for Rank Group</p>
<p>Neither William Hill nor Rank Interactive has made any statements regarding Kemp’s new position. It is unclear whether Rank made a better offer or if her decision to leave William Hill was somehow motivated by the operator’s recent acquisition of 888 Holding and the resulting organizational changes.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Rank Interactive gained an experienced and versatile professional with a proven industry track record. The operator could indeed use any extra talent it can, considering its predicted drop in revenue for Q2 2022. The group expects to earn approximately $49 million by the end of the fiscal year, compared to its previous estimates of between $57 million and $67 million. This correction marks the second time that it lowered its guidance this year.</p>
<p>According to Rank Group, the weaker performance resulted from a decreased number of clients at its physical venues due to the pandemic. Rising inflation also negatively impacted the company’s bottom line. As a result, the operator’s share price experienced a 16.9% drop to $1.018 in mid-June, though it has slightly recovered since then.</p>
<p>Despite the drawbacks, Rank Group’s iGaming arm, which Kemp will be joining, is performing satisfactorily. Excluding Grosvenor, the operator’s other brands also appear to be in good health. Rank Group’s preliminary Q2 results will be announced on August 18, which should provide better insight into the company’s financial situation.</p>
