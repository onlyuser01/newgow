    <h1>Aruba Casino Resorts Shreveport Casinos Hotels 5 Casino Edgewater Casino Casinos In Tampa Florida Bi</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We hope this message finds you well.</p>
<p>We have checked the account and found that our Security team identified several duplicate accounts that the member created on BingoHall.</p>
<p>All accounts have been closed by our Security department according to the following rule in our Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>2.9 An Account Holder can own only one BingoHall Account at a time. If this rule is breached, BingoHall reserves the right to block and/or delete the superfluous BingoHall Account(s) held by the Account Holder in breach of this clause. BingoHall also has the right to reallocate all the funds in the different superfluous BingoHall Accounts to a single BingoHall Account and to delete the remaining superfluous Account(s). No Bonus given to the superfluous BingoHall Account(s) will be reallocated. If an act of fraud is detected on a Member's Account, BingoHall will block the Account and freeze the funds, and the Member will be permanently excluded from the BingoHall Group Network. No payout will be due to the Member.</p>
<p>Additionally, since multiple accounts were opened, this was also a breach of the following rule in our Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>4.8 The Account Holder can use only one Bonus per household/IP address. In case of Bonus abuse, the Bonus will be forfeited and any funds on the Account shall be frozen.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding in this matter and we are at your full disposal should you need any further information.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Bingo Hall</p>
