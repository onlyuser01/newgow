    <h1>Casinos Near Joplin Mo Ute Casino Online Casino Live Fitz Casino Tunica 123 Vegas Casino No Deposit</h1>

<p>I created an account with WebbySlot casino (https://www.webbyslot.com/) on October 2021.</p>
<p>The next two months I made over a hundred sports bets there and also played some slots.</p>
<p>I made multiple successful deposits and withdrawals. In December 2021 I managed to win a series</p>
<p>of sports bets and got my account balance to over 3600 €. I then tried to withdraw some of the money,</p>
<p>but WebbySlot closed my account and confiscated all my winnings.</p>
<p>WebbySlot sent me a short e-mail saying that my account is closed because of surebet and only the remaining</p>
<p>amount of deposits (423 €) would be paid back to me. I tried to contact the casino to discuss the matter</p>
<p>as my bets were normal bets with similar odds that every other casino offered at the time. However, their</p>
<p>only answer was that their provider flagged my bets as a violation of the betting terms and they therefore</p>
<p>confiscated my winnings and closed my account.</p>
<p>I don't understand how WebbySlot or their provider came to the conclusion that my bets were somehow surebets.</p>
<p>I have placed similar bets in many other casinos and never had issues withdrawing my winnings from any of them.</p>
<p>I had also already placed similar bets at WebbySlot for two months with no problems. I did not chance my betting</p>
<p>pattern. I just happened to win a series of bets and then they decided to confiscate all my winnings. All my efforts</p>
<p>at placing bets there for two months were for nothing.</p>
