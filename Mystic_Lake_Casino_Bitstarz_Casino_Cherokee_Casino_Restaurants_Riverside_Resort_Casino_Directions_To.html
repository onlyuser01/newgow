<p>Global sports data company Sportradar announced the appointment of Eric Conrad to the newly created role of Managing Director, Strategic Partnerships and Content, North America.</p>
<p>Maximize Gains, Ensure Sustained Growth</p>
<p>New appointment Conrad will take charge of the US Sports Content and Partnerships (SCP) team and continue to build on the successful foundation established so far, comprising of critical partnerships with the NHL, NBA and MLB which helped Sportradar innovate and drive value for its customers and fans of sports and affirm its leading position in North America.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news of the new appointment, Sportradar’s chief commercial officer Eduard Blonk noted that Conrad joined the company “at a time of rapid growth for the North American market.”</p>
<p>“Eric has the leadership track record and experience we believe are critical to lead the regional SCP team, including the ability to forge additional partnerships, a strong focus on value creation with the sports fan in the center and a focus on delivering value to our customers.” Eduard Blonk, CCO, Sportradar</p>
<p>In his new role as Managing Director for North American strategic partnerships and content, Conrad, who will report directly to Blonk, will work closely with all partners of Sportradar from the sports betting and media space to maximize commercial gains, and will also pursue new, long-term partnerships to help propel sustained growth.</p>
<p>Accomplished Sports Media Executive</p>
<p>Boasting more than 20 years of experience in transactional sports rights across both major professional leagues and the media space, Conrad is an accomplished media executive, who personally negotiated hundreds of sports agreements in the US and globally.</p>
<p>His most recent role was Executive Vice President at Univision, an American Spanish-language free-to-air television network, dealing with Programming and Acquisitions and responsible for building the media’s sports rights portfolio by negotiating partnerships with leading sports organizations such as FIFA, UEFA, Concacaf, Conmebol, and others.</p>
<p>Before joining Univision, Conrad performed in various roles within ESPN’s Programming and Acquisition team. He also worked for the MLB and NBA, selling media rights and sponsorships for both major leagues.</p>
<p>The appointment of Conrad followed hot on the heels of the appointment of Oscar Brodkin, who took the role of Managing Director for the Asia-Pacific region earlier in the month.
