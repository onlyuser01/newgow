<p>Unibet launches sportsbook in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Retail operations will be first and digital wagers will follow next</p>
<p>The companies hope to create a best in class experience</p>
<p>Kindred-owned operator Unibet has launched its first Pennsylvanian sportsbook and the second in the country. The company has partnered with Mohegan Sun Pocono in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>Unibet Launches PA Sportsbook, Second in the USA</p>
<p>Unibet, a Kindred-owned sports betting, casino and poker brand, has launched its second sportsbook in the United States. The new betting facility is located in Pennsylvania, one of the latest states to formally give its approval to sports betting post-May 2018 and launch online gambling and poker as of July 2019.</p>
<p>Unibet will unfold its offer in the state with the assistance of Mohegan Sun Pocono. The company is looking to establish a footprint in every major state across the US, after earlier, Unibet teamed up with the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City in New Jersey, just at the beginning of September.</p>

<p>While Mohegan Sun Pocono will initially focus on running retail operators, the property will gradually make its way into the digital space and online betting options will roll out before 2019 is out.</p>
<p>Unibet will rely on Kambi, one of the leading sports betting vendors, to provide the technology necessary for bettors to place their wagers in comfort and without running a risk of misfires. This is a particularly auspicious moment for Unibet to be expanding, as the NFL and NHL Leagues are back in full blast. Not least of all, the NBA games are also already running.</p>
<p>Everything Goes According to Plan</p>
<p>This launch marks several months of preparation after Kindred signed up the deal with Mohegan Sun Pocono earlier this year in January. Commenting on recent events, Kindred US SVP Manuel Stan:</p>
<p>We are excited and proud to partner with Mohegan Sun Pocono to welcome patrons to our new Sportsbook and offer a great extension to our online product in one of the largest states to regulate both online sports betting and casino.</p>
<p>Mr. Stan explained that Kindred had been looking for a ‘strong partner’ who is equally focused on customer-satisfaction and the user experience as much as the company itself. According to him, Unibet would deliver unmatched.</p>
<p>Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment VP of Interactive Gaming Aviram Alroy expressed the same positive attitude towards the launch. In his words, Kindred and Unibet are one of the world’s best online and sportsbook operators, specifically when it comes to regulated markets.</p>
<p>“Introduction of the Unibet offering to the market is a great positive for Mohegan Sun, as well as the State of Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>As a result, the companies expect to be able and offer players ‘best in class experience’. The US betting market continues to expand quickly, with more markets looking to expand their legal frameworks to permit the activity.</p>
<p>Vendors, such as Intralot and Rush Street, are also looking to gain more ground in what is already a very dynamic and competitive market.</p>
