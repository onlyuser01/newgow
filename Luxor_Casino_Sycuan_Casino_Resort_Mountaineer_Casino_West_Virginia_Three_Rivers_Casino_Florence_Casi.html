    <h1>Luxor Casino Sycuan Casino Resort Mountaineer Casino West Virginia Three Rivers Casino Florence Casi</h1>

<p>Good day, everyone,</p>
<p>Our license holder is reviewing this case as well, and we will provide information similar to what has been shared with them.</p>
<p>On September 26th, we got the first letter about the client's addiction. In that letter, the client referenced an email sent on August 3rd, but we're unsure why we didn't receive it. Most likely, the reason for not sending and receiving the letter correctly is due to the email settings to which the client no longer has access. However, we received his "reply" to his own letter dated 3 August, which was not received on 26 September, and the account was blocked immediately after.</p>
<p>The case has escalated due to the following rules in our Terms and Conditions and Responsible Gambling section:</p>
<p>"After sending a request to block Your account to security@royspins.com, please make sure You get a confirmation email back. Sometimes emails might be stuck in Spam, if You havenâ€™t received a confirmation email from security@royspins.com, please contact our Support Department.</p>
<p>When the Customer sends an email to support@royspins.com or security@royspins.com, the Customer must make sure that this message is directly addressed and not a forward or carbon copy (cc). There is a high possibility that these types of emails will go into Spam and therefore won't be viewed by the relevant department. This procedure is even more relevant when the matter is regarding account closure or gambling problems."</p>
<p>We use a Google email platform and do not experience any issues with it from our end. We receive emails without any technical errors on a daily basis; therefore, we assume that the error on 3rd August happened on the customer's end.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, after a secondary review of the case, we have initiated a refund of the total deposit amount, 244 euros, made after August 3rd.</p>
<p>Mistakes can happen, but we kindly request the client to exercise caution when sending letters or notifications in similar circumstances to avoid such situations in the future.</p>
<p>Hope this information helps!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>RoySpins Team</p>
