    <h1>Casinos In Wendover Hallmark Casino Casino In Kansas Argosy Casino Kansas City Evansville Indiana Ca</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been playing on Wolfy Casino for 1-2 weeks. I like to play pretty conservative, so I make deposits and turn it once, or a little more. Then I withdraw. This is the way I like to do it to control my gambling.</p>
<p>Following is stated in the T&amp;C, which clearly says that wagering your deposit only once is accepted:</p>
<p>"To make a withdrawal the player must make a deposit and wager min 1 time his deposit. Any Winnings with no deposit bonus can have a max cash out of 50 €."</p>
<p>Today I reveived the folling e-mail from them stating my account has been closed, and referred me to support for futher information.</p>
<p>So I contacted live chat and asked them to give me a reason. They started accusing me for money laundering.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to my brother almost exactly the same time. Sure we do have similar names, and maybe that's gave them a reason to think we are "the same person". We have played from different account, from different IP-adresses, and both of us have completed the verification process, including uploading photo of ID etc.</p>
<p>Hereby I also paste the chat transcript with the live support. They couldn't really define why they accused me for money laundering, just referring to the T&amp;C, which I have not broke at any point:</p>

<p>[11:26] KillKewsa: Hi [11:26] Madison has joined the conversation [11:27] KillKewsa: I got an e-mail about that my account will get closed. [11:27] KillKewsa: First off they didnt give me a reason. Secondly, I still have funds in there that I want to withdraw [11:28] KillKewsa: At least you must let me withdraw my funds. They were deposited without a bonus, and I have the right to get them back. [11:28] Madison has joined the conversation [11:28] Madison: Hi [11:29] Madison: Your account has been suspended in connection with money laundering which we do not tolerate [11:29] KillKewsa: What do you mean money laundering? [11:29] KillKewsa: I have deposited funds from an e-wallet and withdrawn to the same wallet. How on earth can that be money laundering? [11:30] Madison: This was conducted by the security team of the game provider [11:31] KillKewsa: Ok. But you have to let me recieve my funds back, even if you don't allow me to play further at your casino. [11:32] Madison: We have a zero tolerance towards inappropriate play and fraudulent activity. We will seek criminal and contractual sanctions against any person involved in or suspected of involvement in fraud, dishonesty or criminal acts, or collusion or suspected collusion with other persons involved in fraud, dishonesty or criminal acts. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating, game manipulation, attempting to defraud us or other users of the website, payment fraud, payment reversals, use of stolen credit cards, money laundering or other attempts to deposit funds obtained from ill-gotten means. We will withhold all payments to you where your involvement in any of the above acts or activities is suspected and we reserve the right to suspend or close your Account and bar you from further participation in the website. [11:32] KillKewsa: This is not fair. I had around €900 in there, of which €771 was from my last deposit. You can't just steal that money from me! [11:33] KillKewsa: I havent been involved in any criminal acts!!! [11:33] KillKewsa: How can depositing money and withdrawing be a criminal act oe money layndering? [11:33] KillKewsa: That is what you do on a casino, right? Depositing funds, playing, and withdrawing!!!???? [11:37] KillKewsa: And also, please explain to me: What EXACTLY did I do which you count as "money laundering" or "criminal activity"??? [11:40] KillKewsa: How can it be criminalized to play on a casino? That'ss what a casino is for, right? [11:43] KillKewsa: Same thing happened to my brother, he got a mail from you almost exactly the same time as me. Do you thing we are the same person or what is the problem? [11:44] KillKewsa: We have been looking for a casino which seems trustwortyh, and we found Wolfy which had very good reciews. And now THIS happens? Where do those good reviews come from? [11:46] KillKewsa: Sure we have similar names, because we are brothers right? That doesn't give you a reason to assume we are the same person..... [11:46] KillKewsa: And now you suddenly stops replying to me!!??? [11:56] KillKewsa: I require an answer... [11:57] KillKewsa: You just stole €900 from me and won't even give a reason... [11:59] KillKewsa: I can prove via transaction history both on my bank and on my E-wallet that the money I deposited to you is compleyely mine.... [11:59] KillKewsa: How can it be money laundering to deposit my own money and play with?</p>
