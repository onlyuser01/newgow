    <h1>Casino Workers News Zone Casino Sweep Coins Casino Hotels Near Southland Casino Harrah S Casino Lake</h1>

<p>Hello a few months ago I won and was able to withdraw 9500$ a few weeks later I won again and tried to with draw 5000 the suddenly they disabled my account and not only my account but my sister's account who had referred me and my mother in laws account who we referred as well they sited a multiple accounts issue. non of us live together and we've spent literally thousands to play I was in and out of the hospital and my sister would visit me and we would play on our phones it kept me sane while I was sick we provided all of our identification whatever they could want, I was willing to do absolutely anything so was my sister and mother in law after a very long time they said they were not giving me my account back. I was more upset about not being able to have a distraction while in the hospital than the money. Fast-forward a couple months and they re-enabled my sisters account[she's the one who referred me ] and sited that she was not aloud to send referrals anymore but was given her account t back even with her remaining few bucks still there. Mine however is still disabled with over 5000 sitting inside. I don't understand how just weeks before I jumped through all their verification whoops ect and they let me withdraw 9500 then the next time I win they do this ! When I say we've each deposited thousands upon thousands I mean thousands the 9500 and 5000 does t even balance me out it just about breaks even what I'd spent in deposits am I able to get mine re-enable like my sister's. She did nothing but randomly went to the site and it let her back on with a message that said no more referrals were aloud. Please help</p>
