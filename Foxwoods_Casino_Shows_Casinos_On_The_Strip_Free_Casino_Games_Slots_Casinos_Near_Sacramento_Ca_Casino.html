<p>The globally-recognized supplier, Pragmatic Play, has struck a new content partnership in a prominent regulated market, Austria. The partnership brings Pragmatic’s portfolio to the platform of Austrian Lotteries website, win2day, which is an established and trusted provider of online casino and lottery products in the country.</p>
<p>The website also features sports betting products and will now see its product offering considerably bolstered by the options made available by the supplier. Among the games that win2day will be able to provide its players within the coming weeks are such excellent games as Madame Destiny: Megaways, Gates of Olympus, Sweet Bonanza, and more.</p>
<p>Other games to be featured here include Big Bass Splash, Wolf Gold, Tomb of the ScarabQueen, Book of the Fallen, and many more. Pragmatic Play CCO Irina Cornides welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s portfolio deployed with win2day in a bid to increase its customer base in the market. She added:</p>
<p>"Pragmatic Play is proud to partner with operators who share our commitment to product quality and player protection, as we strive to provide engaging entertainment experiences for new and established audiences worldwide."</p>
<p>Win2day Head of Games Martin Miesler was similarly pleased with the news and he too welcomed the chance to see Pragmatic’s games launched with the brand. He added that the website is particularly proud to welcome an impressive and innovative portfolio of games to offer to its online casino players, such as the products now made available through Pragmatic Play's content injection.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pragmatic Play has been growing its footprint significantly, with the company introducing fresh slots rapidly and further consolidating its global presence through a series of targeted content alliances. Recently, the company teamed up with ComeOn Group to provide content to the latter’s online casino brand in the Netherlands, ComeOn.nl.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play also doubled down on its expansion in Latin America through a tie-up with SA Esportes. In a similar regional move, the company also teamed up with Vívelo24 in Mexico. Pragmatic continues to grow its footprint in regulated markets across the world, focusing on established ones such as jurisdictions in Europe, and emerging opportunities in North and South America.</p>
<p>Besides Latin America, Pragmatic Play has been busy growing its presence in other regulated markets. Just recently, the supplier teamed up with bet365 in Ontario, Canada, one of the largest iGaming markets to date. It is an excellent opportunity for Pragmatic to continue expanding its clout as the go-to supplier for brands looking to garner a competitive edge.</p>
