    <h1>Casinos Near Los Angeles Pechanga Resort Casino Photos Cloudbet Casino Casinos Lake Tahoe Casino Yon</h1>

<p>Hi I tried withdrawing my winnings to have I rejected everything, I spoke with chat and they asked me to upload card details again and verified it again then told me I could resubmit request, how ever this again got rejected. I was then told that it can’t be done to my card so I had to request bank transfer. I went to do that whilst in chat and then noticed it wouldn’t let me because mine bank transfer is $500 so after a while the got Thackeray to me and said they will do a manual transfer. Stayed in chat till one person decided to end the chat started the whole process again and was told that they were about to do the transfer straight away, anyway some time passes by and I keep checking my mail for confirmation to say it’s been done… nope then I gi to log back in to see if it had been done yet and the have disabled my account ! I contacted chat again and was told it was temporary and will be reinstated when they process bank transfer, I said since when does an account need to be closed to do this and just kept being told all night long to be patient I’m in the line and I said why Whalen I was just told that it was being done like ten mins ago and again please be patient and to have faith my account will be put back online soon. I said I don’t have faith sorry because I don’t see why it has to be disabled never heard of that before and I asked them to try a new card so I don’t have to wait 5to ten days and they said no basically. Not happy because half a day has passed now and still no access and no confirmation email</p>
