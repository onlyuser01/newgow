<p>The prominent iGaming software provider has expanded the number of supported payment methods with the addition of NOWPaymnets</p>
<p>This way, NuxGames’ clients will also be able to accept cryptocurrency payments, leading to better customer uptake and improved quality-of-life features for players who prefer to use digital currencies to make deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>NuxGame and NOWPayments Bring Crypto to iGaming</p>
<p>NOWPaymnets is also a carefully picked partner, as the company has a robust track record for delivering on this technology and supporting payments. NuxGame CEO Daniel Heywood welcomed the opportunity to see this new partnership through, speaking of how significant it was for consumers as well as for business partners:</p>
<p>We see great potential in the crypto space and believe that this partnership will help us stay ahead of the curve and provide the best possible experience to our customers. NuxGame CEO Daniel Heywood</p>
<p>NuxGame is confident that NOWPayments is a solution that will enable businesses to reach new audiences and tap into the crypto users’ sector. The push has been on all levels in the industry, from operators launching one-hundred percent crypto platforms, to payment providers realizing the importance of supporting popular digital tokens, and even casino platform and game developers who understand that consumers want an authentic crypto experience.</p>
<p>NOWPayments CEO Xena Kash was similarly happy to see this partnership through. There is mass adoption of crypto payments, Kash explained, and thanks to cooperations such as the one now established with NuxGame, consumers may benefit. She said:</p>
<p>Partnership with NuxGame is a great way for NOWPayments to grasp all pains and desires of the gambling industry. Being so close to emerging stars and already established market players, NuxGame possesses extremely valuable expertise for us. NOWPayments CEO Xena Kash</p>
<p>Both NOWPaymnets and NuxGame are ready to share expertise and bring value to the businesses they team up with and support. Not least, the companies are confident that the solution they offer is efficient and secure.</p>
<p>Previously, NuxGame teamed up with Symplify to power its AI-based CRM solutions and offer more value to partners.</p>
