    <h1>Shazam Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Robert De Niro Movie Casino Casino In Danville Virginia Where I</h1>

<p>Good day!</p>
<p>Hope you can help me get back my $ 292.5 that 1xBET casino did not credit to my payment wallet.</p>
<p>On September 22, I received a notification from the casino about the completion of verification and permission to withdraw funds.</p>
<p>After reviewing this message, on the same day I bet $ 2,925 on the withdrawal. But I only received $ 2632.5.</p>
<p>$ 292.5 didnâ€™t reach me.</p>
<p>I immediately drew the attention of the casino to this, for several days I was informed that they were considering my situation.</p>
<p>On September 26, the casino notified me that my funds were successfully credited to my account. But, after checking the balance of my Neteller payment wallet, I still did not find $ 292.5 on it.</p>
<p>On September 27, I sent a screenshot of the withdrawal to the casino.</p>
<p>On September 28, I re-reported the lack of funds, attached to the message an extract from my payment wallet (confirmation of the amount credited to the wallet) and a screenshot of the withdrawal from the casino (confirmation of the withdrawn amount).</p>
<p>After examining the evidence I provided and realizing that it was not possible to mislead me, the casino sent a message that in special cases, for some gaming accounts, they may cancel the commission compensation.</p>
<p>On September 28, I sent a claim to the casino, in response to which the casino reported that all consultations on my appeal had been provided earlier.</p>
<p>Please also note that collecting a commission without prior notice violates my civil rights. I must be properly notified of the collection of the commission, as well as its amount, immediately before the withdrawal of funds. I was able to assume that the commission was charged only when I saw that the deposited amount did not correspond to the withdrawal amount. And the casino assured me for a week that the funds were successfully credited to my wallet.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, I am asking you to help restore justice and return my $ 292.5 to me.</p>
