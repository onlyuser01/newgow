<p>Data, technology and broadcast company Genius Sports released today its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial report, posting an impressive increase in revenue and a significant drop in the group’s net loss.</p>
<p>Quarterly and Full-Year Revenue</p>
<p>Genius Sports generated $105.34 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and $341.03 million in the full year ended December 31, 2022, posting increases across all its divisions both in the quarterly and full-year readings.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, Mark Locke, co-founder and chief executive officer of Genius Sports, outlined the company’s success in delivering on its forecast in each quarter as a display of its “commitment to executing the financial and strategic plan” set forth at the start of 2022.</p>
<p>We remain relentlessly focused on balancing investment in our highest growth initiatives, while still demonstrating the unique operating leverage of our business model. Mark Locke, co-founder &amp; CEO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Mark Locke is convinced that in 2023, the company should be able to capitalize on its global competitive position and “capture the immense opportunity” ahead of it.</p>
<p>Across the divisions, Betting Technology, Content &amp; Services was up 21.5% in the quarter and 18.1% in the full twelve months; Media Technology, Content &amp; Services increased by 50.4% in Q4 and 71.2% in full-year 2022; and, Sports Technology &amp; Services contributed to the total with an increase of 8.6% in Q4 and 31.9% in the year.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA, Net Loss</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was $2.66 million, up 121% year-over-year, while for the full year 2022, it was $15.79 million, a nine-fold increase as compared to 2021. Both group revenue and group adjusted EBITDA exceeded Genius Sports’ guidance of $340 million and $15 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Group net loss in Q4 was $127.72 million, up two-and-a-half times from $53.29 million in Q4 2021. For the full year, the group’s net loss fell by 69.4% to $181.64 million ($592.75 million in 2021).</p>
<p>Our expectation of nearly tripling our Group Adj. EBITDA and generating free-cash-flow in the second half of 2023 is the direct result of a cost base that does not need to grow in line with revenues moving forward. Nick Taylor, CFO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>Based on the 2022 results and current performance, Genius Sports maintained its 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $391 million and $41 million and expects to generate positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>“With $159m of total cash on our balance sheet, zero debt financing, and our legacy warrants now removed, our shareholders are well positioned to capture the benefits of profitability and cash flow acceleration,” Taylor concluded.</p>
