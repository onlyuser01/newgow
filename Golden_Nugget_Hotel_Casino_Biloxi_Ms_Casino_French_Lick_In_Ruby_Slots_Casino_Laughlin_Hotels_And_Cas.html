    <h1>Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Biloxi Ms Casino French Lick In Ruby Slots Casino Laughlin Hotels And Cas</h1>

<p>I tried to solve this issue with the casino time but they simply don't reply to me.</p>
<p>I deposited money into the website and it was instantaneous, now I'm trying to withdraw the funds but the funds keep "pending" and the website says that this is because there's a lot of people trying to withdraw funds, but the day before this I reached out to the live chat and the lady told me that by Friday the funds should be in my account, because the website usually takes less than 24 hours to process withdrawals.</p>
<p>Time has gone by and I asked the chat why the delay on processing my withdrawal and they only say "4.3.6. Todos os pedidos de levantamentos serão processados dentro de 2 dias úteis, contudo, poderão existir casos em que este prazo poderá ser estendido, dependendo dos canais e/ou métodos de pagamento, e/ou feriados e/ou verificações de conta adicionais." Apologies for being in portuguese, but i'm portuguese and they reply in Portuguese.</p>
<p>I'm here because I just want to withdraw my funds and they simply don't withdraw them and there's no one I can talk to, and the people I talk to just tell me to wait indefinitely.</p>
<p>They cancelled all my withdrawals attempts, as you can see attached to this e-mail, everywhere that says "levantamento" is cancelled by them. But this time they sent me an e-mail (also attached here) telling me that 80€ out of the 200€ were refunded to my credit card (80€ is the total of deposits i've made to the website) and that I'd have to try again to withdraw the sum of 120€ by bank transfer, which I did and now its still pending and of course I didn't receive the 80€ yet. I've reached out to my bank asking them if its possible to refund money that was already charged by the company and they said that was only possible if the money was still being held captive, if the money's already been charged it's impossible for them to refund, so the alegations that the website does about refunding me the 80€ worth of deposits i've made through credit card is false, they can't do it, the only thing they can do is transfer money to those cards, but they denied they've done it. So as of right now, out of 200€ I haven't received a cent. Which is a bummer. I can only talk to people on the live chat, and even when I e-mail the support e-mail the response comes from someone on the livechat. It's impossible to reach out to someone responsible that can solve efectively your problems. I will keep the attachments public so everyone can see the weird game this casino plays. I seriously doubt they will reply to this complaint since they don't reply to any complaints online whatsoever, I'm amazed how this casino isn't blacklisted here. And another funny thing is that in the transactions history it doesn't appear the supposed 80€ refund, I asked them about this and they said they will investigate if it's possible to show it there, that is a major worrying factor for me because if it doesn't show there, how can i prove I won that money on the casino? You can see the previous attempts to withdraw are from 200, but they can say i just gambled away 80€ and that would be lying, so i asked them to put that 80€ refund that they said the did in the transactions history. I'm still waiting.</p>
