<p>One of the biggest and most diversified gaming and entertainment Canadian operators, Gateway Casinos and Entertainment, announced on Tuesday that it appointed Queenie Wong to serve as the company’s new chief financial officer (CFO). Gateway revealed that the appointment is effective as of January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Gateway Casinos Picks Queenie Wong as Its New CFO</p>
<p>Bachelor in accounting from the University of British Columbia, Wong was a part of the Audit and Assurance Group at PwC. She served at the position of senior manager for seven years until September 2011. After that, she joined Gateway and she was a part of the company for more than ten years now.</p>
<p>“Ms. Wong has been employed by Gateway since 2011, previously serving in key finance roles such as the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance,” reads a statement released by Gateway Casinos and Entertainment</p>
<p>For the bigger part of her tenure at Gateway, Wong has taken the position of chief accounting officer. Now, in her new role as CFO, Wong will continue to report directly to Tony Santo, the company’s CEO. It is important to mention that Wong’s new position is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Wong Played Key Roles Helping Gateway Grow Significantly</p>
<p>While a part of the company, Wong has served an integral role in helping Gateway achieve major growth thanks to seamless collaboration with the company’s internal finance team and external stakeholders and investors. Moreover, she served key roles within strategic transactions such as the acquisition of Playtime Gaming. This transaction alone expanded the company’s portfolio by adding six properties. Wong also served an instrumental role for the company’s refinancing in October 2021 as well as Gateway’s expansion into Ontario.</p>
<p>“Queenie’s leadership has been instrumental in facilitating Gateway’s growth across the Company’s portfolio of properties and new developments, as well as being a strategic leader throughout the COVID recovery period.” Tony Santo, CEO at Gateway</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Gateway’s CEO, Tony Santo, acknowledged that Wong has played strategic roles in helping the company expand its portfolio. In conclusion, he outlined that she has proven to be a strategic leader during the COVID recovery period.</p>
<p>The news comes at a time when casinos in Ontario are facing further challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this week officials in Ontario revealed that casinos are once again closing their doors for visitors due to the pandemic. What is known so far is that the new lockdown would be in place for three weeks. Besides casinos, it also impacts the operation of gyms, as well as restaurants and other indoor businesses.</p>
