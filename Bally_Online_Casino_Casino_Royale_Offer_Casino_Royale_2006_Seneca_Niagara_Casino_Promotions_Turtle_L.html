<p>UPDATE: Planet Hollywood Pools Reopen After Las Vegas Health Department Closure</p>

<p>UPDATE: Planet Hollywood reopened its two pools on Tuesday, June 27, after the resort corrected all compliance violations to the satisfaction of the Southern Nevada Health District. The pools had been closed for two weeks.</p>
<p>EARLIER: Both swimming pools at Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas Strip have been closed for more than a week. That’s after the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) discovered water chemistry and lifeguard staffing violations during a routine check on Monday, June 12, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on Tuesday, June 20.</p>

<p>When health officials inspected the pools located on the sixth deck of the Caesars Entertainment property, they found “water chemistry violations involving the north pool,” according to an email sent by public information officer Dave Sheehan to the newspaper.</p>
<p>They also found alterations made to drain covers and lifeguard staffing violations at both pools. The violations included “inattentive lifeguards, lack of managerial control over lifeguards, and improper rotation of lifeguards,” Sheehan wrote in his email.</p>
<p>The pools, including a bar on the south pool deck, are part of a deck called the Scene, which also features a free-standing Flowrider wave machine.</p>

<p>A message on Planet Hollywood’s website indicates that the Scene is still “temporarily closed” after more than a week. SNHD told the R-J that both pools may reopen as soon as Planet Hollywood demonstrates that compliance is achieved.</p>
<p>In a statement about the situation emailed to the R-J, Planet Hollywood wrote: “We care about the health and safety of our guests. We are working closely and in full cooperation with the Southern Nevada Health District to address all issues presented to us. In the meantime, our guests are being redirected to our neighboring pools at Horseshoe and Paris.”</p>
