<p>OK’d in Oklahoma: State’s Sports Betting Bill Clears First Hurdle</p>

<p>An Oklahoma sports betting bill that would also expand tribal gaming to include non-house-banked table games cleared an important legislative hurdle on Monday evening.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma House of Representatives Appropriations and Budget Committee approved HB 3375 by a healthy 18-8 margin.</p>
<p>As well as authorizing the table games, the bill would legalize parimutuel sports wagering (but not horse or dog betting) for the state’s 70-odd tribal casinos by an amendment to state compacts.</p>
<p>The bill, introduced by Representative Kevin Wallace (R-Wellston), states:</p>
<p>HB3375 provides state approval for new game offerings under the State Tribal Gaming Act. Tribes may elect to begin offering non-house banked table games and sports pools by submitting a written supplement to an existing gaming compact with the state. The agreement requires a tribe to pay the state 10 percent of the monthly net wins from the operation of non-house banked table games and sports pools.</p>
<p>Steps-Up Sports Betting</p>
<p>“Do you think gambling is good for the people of Oklahoma?” asked Representative Todd Russ (R-Cordell) during the hearing.</p>
<p>“That is a philosophical issue but nothing in this bill deals with whether it is good or bad,” replied Wallace.</p>
<p>But Wallace hopes the bill will indeed be good for Oklahoma in the form of millions of dollars pouring into the coffers of the cash-strapped legislature.</p>
<p>The state is desperate to find a solution for its protracted budget impasse. A previous gambling bill, which included gaming expansion but not sports betting, was part of a failed revenue package entitled “Step Up Oklahoma” that went down in flames earlier this month.</p>
<p>Expected Value</p>
<p>The bill estimates exclusivity fee revenues resulting non-house-banked table games will be about $22 million per year. These casino games like Three-Card Poker and Ultimate Texas Hold ’em, in which one player acts as the bank. The bill makes no mention of craps or roulette, as misreported by some media outlets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the exclusivity fee revenue resulting from the sports pools is estimated to be about $9.8 million per year.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association calculates that a regulated sports betting market could contribute $600 million to Oklahoma’s economy and generate up to $124 million in tax revenues for the state each year.</p>
<p>As it stands, the bill would not allow the NBA and MLB their so-called “integrity fee” – a one percent cut of profits that equates to a 25 percent tax on gross gaming revenues. The leagues are expected to lobby hard against the bill.</p>
