<p>FansUnite Forays into Ohio</p>
<p>Ohio recently legalized sports betting and is preparing to officially launch its sports betting market on January 1, 2023. According to analysts, sportsbooks in the Buckeye State would collectively generate a sports betting handle of around $8.8 billion during the first year of operations.</p>

Thanks to its new license, however, FansUnite will be also allowed to power other sports betting operators with its solutions.</p>

While FansUnite announced its plans to offer gaming products in Ontario almost a year ago, it has now officially grabbed a license that will allow it to foray into the Canadian province.</p>
<p>FansUnite’s expansion is in line with the company’s strategy to conquer more regulated jurisdictions with its betting content.</p>

He said that it represents an important milestone for the company’s US strategy and overall business-to-business operation. Burton said that Ohio will likely quickly cement itself as a big hub for sports wagering.</p>

<p>Burton added that the new license will allow his company to launch in Ohio from day one, providing it with an edge over some of its competitors. The CEO concluded that as FansUnite secures more B2B agreements, it will continue pushing for launches in more sports betting markets.</p>
