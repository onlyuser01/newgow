<p>Delaware Legislature Mulls Tax Relief Plan to Save Its Three Casinos</p>

<p>Delaware casinos are struggling and state lawmakers are debating a bill that would slash taxes in an effort to safeguard their futures.</p>

<p>Senator Brian Bushweller (D-Dover) is the primary sponsor of SB 114, which proposes a tiered tax on slots revenues, instead of the blanket 43.5 percent casinos currently pay to the taxman.</p>
<p>It would also halve the 30 percent tax on table games to 15 percent and suspend the annual license fee.</p>
<p>Delaware Casinos Tax Grab</p>
<p>“Since the slots were instituted in the 1990s in Delaware, the state has persistently and routinely increased its take from the overall slot machine revenue to a point where they’re no longer able to function like a normal business,” Bushweller told Delaware State News.</p>
<p>There does have to be substantial progress made in reducing the damage the state has done to the casino industry,” he added.</p>
<p>Under the proposed tiered system, daily revenue of $75,000 and below would be taxed at 32 percent, with revenues between $75,000 and $150,001 taxed at 35 percent. Revenue between $150,000 and $225,001 would be taxed at 37.5 percent, while anything above $225,000 would be taxed at 43.5 percent.</p>
<p>It’s the third attempt to provide tax relief to Delaware casinos in as many years. But with state coffers in now a healthier position, thanks to the $170 million that’s expected to carry over from the current fiscal year into the next, the proposal has a greater chance of becoming a reality.</p>
<p>$20 Million Hit</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bushweller expects lawmakers to baulk at the $20 million he estimates the new tax regime will cost the state per year. But unless they swallow that $20 million now, there will be no casino industry left to tap in the future.</p>
<p>“The casino industry pays all the same taxes as any other business in Delaware,” said Bushweller.</p>
<p>“You pick a tax and they’re paying it … but in addition to it, through the first three-quarters of 2017, Dover Downs paid $56 million between the horse racing industry and the state,” he said of Delaware’s biggest casino.</p>
<p>Denis McGlynn, president and CEO of Dover Downs Gaming &amp; Entertainment, said due to the hefty sum his company paid last year, it wound up losing $1 million.</p>
<p>“We make money, everybody else gets it but us, and we end up with a million-dollar loss,” he said. “This is just not sustainable.”</p>
