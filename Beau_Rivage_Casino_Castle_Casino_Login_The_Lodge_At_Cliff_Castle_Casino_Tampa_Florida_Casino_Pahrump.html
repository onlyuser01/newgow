<p>Dear Konstantin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the relevant communication. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://casino-z.com/en/information/rules/10:</p>
<p>„For customers who want to set limits on their gambling we offer a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which allows you to close your Account or to restrict your gambling activities on the Service for a minimum of six months. Once your Account has been self-excluded, it will be closed until the expiry of the selected period. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period, you will be able to re-commence the use of any Services by contacting Customer Support.</p>
<p>During the self-exclusion period you must not attempt to open a new Account and you must accept that the Company shall have no financial liability and shall not be held otherwise accountable if you continue gambling or using a new Account with the Service under a different name or address."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email to support@casino-z.com including all the relevant information. In this way you’ll have a proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked as "Self-exclusion" you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>From the forwarded communication I’m not able to distinguish to which email address you have sent your queries.</p>
<p>Additionally, let me explain to you what is the difference between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling. What a player can do if they're unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen the account anytime, and the casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If a player successfully makes a self-exclusion, the casino agrees not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem)</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed in this, a player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. If it won’t work this time, we will intervene.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
