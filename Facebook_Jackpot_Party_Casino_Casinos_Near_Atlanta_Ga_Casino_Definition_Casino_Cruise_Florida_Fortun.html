<p>The two-day testing period of PokerStars PA was very successful, with nearly 2000 players logging on to enjoy online poker games.</p>
<p>PokerStars PA Ready For Full Launch After Successful Test Period</p>
<p>Earlier this week, PokerStars PA went live with its soft launch of its software. The two-day testing period attracted plenty of players with nearly 2000 Pennsylvania residents logging on during this time. Now, PokerStars PA is fully live, and there are plenty of exciting activities for players to enjoy.</p>
<p>On the first day of testing, November 4th, over 700 players joined the site. The second and final day brought in another 1100. On both days, the site was only available during limited hours, but PokerStars PA still managed to see some very impressive numbers.</p>
<p>During the soft launch, PokerStars PA wasn’t running its full range of activities. Only cash games, selected MTTs and sit &amp; gos were available while Zoom Poker and Spin &amp; Gos are expected to launch sometime soon.</p>
<p>All Ready to Go</p>
<p>Everything seems to have gone according to plan, and PokerStars PA is fully launched. While the site is now available 24/7, there are still only three gaming options available. However, within these three sections, there is still plenty of choice.</p>
<p>In the cash game tab, players will be able to find Hold ‘Em and Omaha games, as well as Seven Card Stud, Razz and Triple Draw. Stakes range from 1c/2c up to $50/$100 for Hold’em games and 50c/$1 up to $100/$200 for other games.</p>
<p>There are a wide range of buy-ins available for players interested in playing in sit &amp; gos with buy-ins from $1 up to $5. Most of the events in this section are hypers and turbos, with either 6-handed or heads-up formats. The tournament schedule is much busier than in the soft launch, as well, with all sorts of MTTs offering buy-ins from $2 to $100.</p>
<p>Sundays are always the biggest days at online poker sites like PokerStars; however, no schedule has been released yet for the weekend. It should be full of exciting events and big guarantees, so we’re sure that players are eager to find out what’s in store this coming Sunday during the first week of PokerStars PA’s operation.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time for poker players in Pennsylvania, as they have been waiting for quite a while for online poker to go live in the state. Pennsylvania made online poker legal in 2018, and casino games were launched a couple of months back – but, poker was put on hold.</p>
<p>Now, they finally have the chance to enjoy online poker games without having to visit a brick-and-mortar venue. The site is surely going to attract thousands more players in the coming days, now that PokerStars PA is fully live.</p>
