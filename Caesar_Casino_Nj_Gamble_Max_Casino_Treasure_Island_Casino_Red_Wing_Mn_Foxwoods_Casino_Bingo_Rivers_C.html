<p>Wynn Resorts, a famous American casino and resort corporation, has announced that it will put millions into the renovation of one of its signature hospitality locations – the Wynn Tower Suites on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The Wynn Tower Suites Are Being Renovated</p>
<p>The corporation is currently working on the overhaul, hoping to have it done by the end of June. According to Wynn Resorts, this is the most extensive design evolution ever made to the venue. The announcement stated that the refreshed Wynn Tower Suites will have its 2,674 guest rooms redesigned and will introduce changes to the lobbies, corridors and even elevators as well.</p>
<p>A statement provided further insight into the company’s plans for the venue:</p>
<p>Although individual touches have been created to suit differing room layouts, the most notable changes include a reconfiguration to the washroom in the standard guest room to introduce separate vanities and double the storage space; an expanded dressing area with mirrored walls and upgraded closet with new wardrobe; and an extended multi-purpose table in the main living room for working and dining. Additional power and data ports and advanced touchless in-room technologies complete the project. Wynn Resorts</p>
<p>Todd-Avery Lenahan, the president and chief creative officer of Wynn Design and Development, will personally oversee the overhaul to ensure that quality is up to standard. He is notably the designer behind many of the upcoming new pieces of furniture, lighting and art decorations. The rest of them have been made by acclaimed artisans from all over the world.</p>
<p>Wynn Is Committed to Splendor</p>
<p>This move continues Wynn’s tendency of maintaining a lavish interior. The company has always preferred to appeal to the more well-off bettors and visitors by providing them with high-tier hospitality, unparalleled gambling experiences and state-of-the-art spa zones for relaxation. Brian Gullbrants, the president of Wynn Las Vegas, said that “Wynn sets the standard for luxury experiences” thanks to its continuous evolutions in accordance with its guests’ needs.</p>
<p>Wynn’s desire to cater to its wealthy customers is attested by its venues. The Wynn Palace in Macau, for example, has more five-star restaurants than any other resort in the world. Wynn Macau, on the other hand, has won eight five-star awards as of the time of this writing.</p>
<p>The Wynn Tower Suites renovation will also stick to the company’s principles of providing visitors with the best experiences possible.</p>
<p>Wynn is doubling down on its operations in its native market in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The notorious virus caused devastating turbulences to Wynn’s business in Macau. The corporation usually earns the majority of its income thanks to its venues in the special administrative region. However, the ongoing pandemic and China’s zero-COVID policies have made things much more complicated.</p>
<p>The Western world, on the other hand, has more or less lifted the restrictions, making it a perfect time for Wynn to invest in Las Vegas.</p>
