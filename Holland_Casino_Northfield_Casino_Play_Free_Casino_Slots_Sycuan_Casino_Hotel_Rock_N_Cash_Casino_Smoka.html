    <h1>Holland Casino Northfield Casino Play Free Casino Slots Sycuan Casino Hotel Rock N Cash Casino Smoka</h1>

<p>I won 15k after depositing a very healthy amount into the casino. Did the automatic verification, then got the run around and had to do email verification. Finally did that and got approved. I asked about the withdrawal within 24 hrs as advertised and chat told me that it's actually 24 working hours, which means 3 days total.</p>
<p>Their terms state you are allowed $3000 Euro withdrawal in 24 hrs, and $1000 Euro a day. I withdraw 3 times $1000 and after a couple days delays and emails, I got the first withdrawal. The other 2 were canceled. I emailed the financial department as chat never can help with anything and says to just email financial department. I never got emails back from the financial department and had to ask chat what was happening and gave a back up email. This still hasn't been resolved, every email I have to ask chat to send the transcript. I am still however receiving promotional email.</p>
<p>Most recently I was told I was on a schedule to receive my $1300 per day, with the 2nd one coming today, but my account shows canceled on that withdrawal. I asked chat and this is the answer they gave.</p>

<p>Welcome to SmokAce!</p>
<p>Please clarify how we can help you?</p>
<p>Due to heavy workload, it may take a few minutes for a LiveChat agent to respond.</p>
<p>We apologize for the possible inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>Hello, dear player. My name is Sara.</p>
<p>Tell me, please, how can I help you?</p>
<p>07:14</p>
<p>07:15</p>
<p>I've only had one withdrawal go through, I am supposed to be able to withdraw $3000 a day, the last withdrawal was canceled</p>
<p>07:15</p>
<p>I emailed the finance team twice and have not received an answer back</p>
<p>Please wait a couple of minutes, I will check the information.</p>
<p>07:16</p>
<p>The Finance Department reserves the right to make payments according to an individual schedule and set the maximum and minimum withdrawal amount for each withdrawal procedure, as well as the time required for this procedure, which may vary depending on the withdrawal method, account status and other possible factors affecting the process of withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>If you have already sent a request to the financial department, then please wait for a response. All requests are considered one by one.</p>
<p>And then added the withdrawal schedule of one per day. Which the first has been canceled.</p>
<p>Why is it whenever you win, all you get is the runaround on withdrawals? All of their terms seem like suggestions and they will do withdrawals when they feel like it. I've also asked several times to fix the non response to email and it hasn't been resolved. I'm a frequent player and bet healthy amounts, I just want a casino that can issue withdrawals quickly. Does that exist anymore?</p>
<p>Please help, as I am receiving a snails pace of information from the casino and have been sitting at now 3 days since my first withdrawal has gone through and according to their schedule that said first withdrawal was to be today the 31st, shows as canceled.</p>
<p>The only answer I keep receiving from chat is this.</p>
<p>The casino reserves the right to make payments in accordance with an individual schedule.</p>
<p>Please help, communication had been abysmal on the reasoning as well.</p>
