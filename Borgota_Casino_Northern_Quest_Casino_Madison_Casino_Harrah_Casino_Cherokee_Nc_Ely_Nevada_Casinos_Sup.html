    <h1>Borgota Casino Northern Quest Casino Madison Casino Harrah Casino Cherokee Nc Ely Nevada Casinos Sup</h1>

<p>al bad comments are true .the casino is a joke .deposits take 7 days to get into your acount .you can deposit 10000€ a day but you can only withdraw 500€ every 24 hours.this tactic make sure the other money left you will play it away.i won 1647€ after submitting documents i was able to cash out 500€ only per day .wich was succesfully accepted .same day i made other withdrawl 500€ for the next day and again it was succesfully accepted and detucted from the balance .there was now left 646€ in the balance so late in the evening i was playing suddenly my balance was back at 1164€ in game .i lost it all .i noticed in all these casinos if you begin to play first time you win and if you try to cashout you cant win 1€ anymore they suck your balance dry .no matter what you play you will lose .the casino claim that it was my responsibility that i played my balance away i should wait .for me another dark criminal casino with criminal terms just to take your money .i am trying to file a complaint her but it wont allow me is there a problem ?i dont understand the high rating here i mean a casino who do not want you to cash out your wins because they use some made rules in them favour is for me a criminal hole and nothing else .curacao should now stepp in and make sure all these rules will deleted fro the sites .it is causing huge financial damage to the players.stupidkyc and cash out rules .this cost me in 4 days 9000€ loss because casino use this rules to make sure player will not cash out his wins.</p>
