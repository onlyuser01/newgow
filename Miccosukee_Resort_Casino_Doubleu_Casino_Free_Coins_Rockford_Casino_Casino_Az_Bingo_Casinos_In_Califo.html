<p>The Authority justified its decision with several regulatory breaches by the operator but gave the company the option to appeal</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has taken decisive action by canceling the authorization awarded to Super7plus Limited, effective 17 January 2024. This development closely matches other recent actions by the regulator, as January saw it revoke three more offending operator licenses. The MGA remains the preferred regulator for many gambling companies worldwide, and its willingness to enforce its rules is a positive sign for the industry.</p>
<p>The Cancellation Follows the Standard Procedure</p>
<p>The MGA’s decision calls upon regulations 9 (1) (c) and 10 (1) (a) of the Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations (S.L. 583.06). According to the regulator’s latest update, Super7plus Limited must immediately suspend all gaming operations and cease the registration of any new players, effectively blocking the company from offering its services.</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority has decided to cancel the authorization awarded to Super7plus Limited, bearing reference number MGA/B2C/436/2017. MGA official statement</p>
<p>Super7plus must ensure that all existing players retain access to their accounts, enabling them to withdraw their outstanding player balances. This stipulation guarantees a base level of consumer protection, safeguarding users from any potential fallout. Super7plus must also settle all its fees to the MGA within five days, allowing the relocation process to conclude without complications.</p>
<p>The MGA also requires the offending operator to submit a transaction report extracted from their back-end system, joined by supporting bank statements, attesting that all player funds have been duly remitted to registered players within seven (7) days from the effective date. This step ensures that no customers suffer negative consequences from the cancellation.</p>
<p>Another Offending Operator Bites the Dust</p>
<p>The final stipulation is for Super7plus to immediately remove any reference to the Authority and the authorization as per Article 51 of the Act. This measure guarantees that consumers do not obtain any misleading information and officially distances the MGA from future actions by the offending operator, preserving the regulator’s integrity.</p>
<p>Super7plus was a sports betting operator focusing on the German market, claiming to offer an innovative gaming system. However, failing to comply with the MGA’s strict rules severely limits its future options. The company has the right to appeal, but past precedent has demonstrated that such efforts are rarely successful.</p>
<p>The MGA has been notably active recently, with January witnessing the cancellation of licenses for Genesis Global, Betago, and Rush Gaming. This proactive attitude underscores the regulatory body’s commitment to maintaining integrity and compliance within the gaming industry. The regulator performs regular compliance checks on its licensees, solidifying its position as one of the world’s premiere gambling authorities.</p>
