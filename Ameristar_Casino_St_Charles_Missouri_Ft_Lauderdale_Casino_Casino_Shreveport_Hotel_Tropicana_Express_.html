    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Charles Missouri Ft Lauderdale Casino Casino Shreveport Hotel Tropicana Express</h1>

<p>Online casino game developer and publisher SciPlay recently started a new marketing campaign for its game Jackpot Party, featuring actress and entrepreneur Sofia Vergara. Ten lucky players who engage with the game while the promotion lasts will win an all-expense-paid trip to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Such Endorsements Are Nothing New for Vergara</p>
<p>Marketing for the new campaign started on 17 May with a video showing Vergara playing Jackpot Party on her phone behind the stage at America’s Got Talent. 2022 will be her third year as a judge in the popular talent show competition. The Hispanic beauty appeared in advertisements for brands like Head &amp; Shoulders, Comcast, CoverGirl, Cerveza Águila, Quaker, and McDonald’s. She has featured in commercials for over two dozen companies, so the deal with SciPlay is nothing new to her.</p>
<p>Behind her glamorous appearance, Vergara is a business-savvy entrepreneur. She co-founded Latin World Entertainment, a multimillion-dollar media empire providing licensing, marketing, and production services to Hispanic stars. Vergara is also the company’s most successful client with her multitude of lucrative endorsement and licensing contracts.</p>
<p>SciPlay Focuses on Its Marketing Initiatives</p>
<p>Chief Revenue Officer for SciPlay Noga Halperin lauded Sofia Vergara’s talents, noting that she had the influence to introduce millions of new players to Jackpot Party and allow them to enjoy the Las Vegas gaming experience from anywhere.</p>
<p>Sofia’s natural enthusiasm, combined with her global fan base, make her ideal for this campaign. Noga Halperin, Chief Revenue Officer for SciPlay</p>
<p>Israel-based creative content agencies Why Worry and C supported the campaign. SciPlay hopes to leverage Vergara’s substantial fanbase, attracting new players and boosting engagement with current users of the featured casino game. The free-to-play Jackpot Party app already has over 10 million downloads on the Google Play store and is among the most popular in its genre.</p>
<p>Head of marketing innovation for SciPlay Eitan Davidson also expressed his excitement over Vergara’s involvement.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to work with Sofia for our first celebrity partnership and bring this beloved game to even more players. Eitan Davidson, head of marketing innovation at SciPlay</p>
<p>SciPlay also recently partnered with NASCAR to advertise its Gold Fish Casino Slots game. These marketing investments come during a slight downturn for the company. Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based privately held investment firm, recently lowered its estimates for SciPlay’s Q2 earnings to $0.19, down from their previous projections of $0.21. Most other analysts share a similar sentiment.</p>
<p>SciPlay announced that it would post its Q2 2022 financial results on 9 August, followed by an Earnings Conference Call the next day.</p>
