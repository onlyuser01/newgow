    <h1>Morongo Casino Buffet Casinos In Denver Ip Casino Resort Spa Bellagio Hotel And Casino Ojos Locos Sp</h1>

<p>Good morning</p>
<p>I joined Go Wild casino, after reading their reviews and reputation on this site, on the 13th of August, and deposited and lost my first deposit of €300. The same day I got an email asking me to verify my details, so I uploaded my ID, my proof of address, and my proof of bank card. Two days later on the 15th I received the same email again, so I replied asking if they'd received them, but not long after noticed they were all accepted within the cashier.</p>
<p>By this point I'd lost two further €300 deposits. On my fourth deposit however, I won €10,792. I was delighted with this and made the maximum withdrawal of €5000!</p>
<p>On the 16th of August they then requested the following documents</p>
<p>1) Selfie holding my ID and a note with the date on it</p>
<p>2) Selfie holding my address letter with the same date note</p>
<p>3) Selfie holding the front of my card with the date note</p>
<p>4) Selfie holding the back of my card with the date note</p>
<p>I thought this was quite excessive but maybe for my own protection, so I sent all of these in the same day.</p>
<p>On the 18th of August they rejected my address letter selfie on the grounds that it was a different letter. So I retook all of the aforementioned photos and sent them selfies holding all three of the letters I had in the house that met their recently dated criteria.</p>
<p>Then on the 20th of August they replied saying that in order to verify my account I was required to provide notarized proof of ID and proof of address. So I booked the soonest appointment I could get, and on Monday 24th August I got those documents notarized and uploaded my signed ID and signed three proof of addresses.</p>
<p>Then yesterday on the 27th August they responded with another email saying;</p>

<p>to me</p>
<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>We would like to inform that our Compliance department has finished reviewing the documents provided and all of them have been approved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as an online casino operator, we are obligated to know that the source of the funds that you use to play with are legitimate. We take responsible gaming very seriously and aim to protect our players as much as possible.</p>
<p>What we need (any of the following):</p>
<p>A link to an official company website showing you in some employee/employer/executive or ownership capacity</p>
<p>A full copy of your pay slip</p>
<p>Proof of sale of shares</p>
<p>Proof of sale of property or properties</p>
<p>Inheritance (a copy of the executor’s letter showing you as the beneficiary and amount, and a copy of a bank statement showing the funds being received from the executors account)</p>
<p>Dividends or shares from a company (a copy of your dividend certificate, and a copy of a bank statement showing the money being received from the company)</p>
<p>You can send these documents by email or send a photo using your camera phone.'</p>
<p>I'm making this complaint now because I don't think they intend to pay my winnings. I verified myself up on the first day of joining up and having sent selfies, date selfies, and even visited a public notary and paid their fees, they're still dragging out requests for documents one at a time. I think if I send them documentation on my current work and employment they'll just keep finding more and more ways to not pay my winnings.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your arbitration, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Scott</p>
