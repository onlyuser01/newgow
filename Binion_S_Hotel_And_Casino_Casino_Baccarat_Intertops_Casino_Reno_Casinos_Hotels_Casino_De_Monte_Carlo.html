    <h1>Binion S Hotel And Casino Casino Baccarat Intertops Casino Reno Casinos Hotels Casino De Monte Carlo</h1>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I registered at Mr.bet with my email and name (that's what was requested from their system, nothing was requested). Deposited and won some money. I have now more than 500 canadian dollars on my account. They asked me to verify my account. I uploaded all the needed documents on their site. But they blocked access citing the fact that I did not enter all my details when registering. Their registering form do not ask for these kind of information. If asked for sure I will fill all that information. I even uploaded my passport next to my face during process. Today the locked my account citing this rule "3.1.3. You must enter all mandatory information requested into your registration form"</p>
<p>This is ridiculous because if they would me enter my account I would provide that information and pass the KYC process</p>
<p>The email from them...</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the Support Service. Recently, you have contacted us about the account.</p>
<p>We understand your feelings and the situation is so frustrating, but, unfortunately, the system detected violation 3.1.3, and then the investigation was done by the appropriate department thoroughly and attentively, after which the violation was confirmed. It means that the account is blocked and there is no way to continue game activity.</p>
<p>As a consequence, your account has been closed and winnings have been voided. The decision is final, which means that no verification may be continued or any other activity in the account.</p>
<p>We are very sorry that you have faced such a situation, but unfortunately, the situation happened and the restrictions were applied.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us if there are any more questions. Our team is always glad to help you!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Manager of the game club, Catalina</p>
