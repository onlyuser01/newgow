<p>The move comes after months of discussions and growing concerns over the safety of student-athletes amidst the burgeoning sports betting industry</p>
<p>In a bid to safeguard collegiate athletes from online harassment and uphold the integrity of college sports, Ohio’s Gov. Mike DeWine, along with NCAA President Charlie Baker, has thrown their support behind a proposed change in the state’s sports betting rules.</p>
<p>NCAA Urges Ohio to Ban Player-Specific Bets Amid Rising Social Media Threats</p>
<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recently submitted a request to the Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) urging for the prohibition of player-specific proposition bets on college athletics competitions, reported The Columbus Dispatch. This move aims to curtail the prevalence of social media threats directed towards collegiate athletes, which have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>Gov. DeWine emphasized the need to protect student-athletes from unnecessary threats, stating that the focus should be on team-based bets rather than individual player performances. He highlighted the disturbing trend of bad actors engaging in unacceptable behavior, making threats against student-athletes both in Ohio and across the nation.</p>
<p>Echoing DeWine’s sentiments, NCAA President Charlie Baker underscored the risks posed by individual prop bets, emphasizing that such bets heighten the vulnerability of student-athletes and compromise the integrity of collegiate competitions. Baker applauded DeWine for taking swift action to address these concerns while responsibly regulating the growing sports betting industry in Ohio.</p>
<p>Ohio Stakeholders Rally Behind NCAA’s Move to Protect Student-Athletes</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes, bettors would no longer be permitted to place prop bets on individual player achievements during collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>However, they would still retain the ability to wager on overall outcomes, final scores, and other team-based bets. It is worth noting that professional sports contests would remain unaffected by these changes.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments have garnered support from various stakeholders within Ohio’s collegiate sports community. University officials, including Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith and University of Dayton vice-president Neil Sullivan, have voiced their backing for the initiative, emphasizing the importance of protecting student-athletes from abuse and threats.</p>
<p>In response to the escalating challenges posed by sports betting, the NCAA has embarked on several initiatives aimed at educating athletes and monitoring online activities to detect and address threats promptly. Additionally, the Association has revised its penalties to ensure that student-athletes are not unduly penalized for minor betting infractions.</p>
<p>As the public comment period commences, sports betting companies will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed rule changes before the Ohio Casino Control Commission makes its decision. The outcome of this deliberation will likely have significant implications for the future of sports betting regulations in Ohio, particularly concerning collegiate athletics.</p>
