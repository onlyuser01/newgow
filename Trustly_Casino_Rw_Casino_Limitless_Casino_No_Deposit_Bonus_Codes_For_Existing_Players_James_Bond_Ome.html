<p>San Francisco 49ers vs Denver Broncos is going to be only their 16th meeting ever. The Niners are the ones who are leading the series 8-7. Most of the Broncos’ wins happened during the Payton Manning era (four wins), but after the legendary QB retired, their record in 49ers vs Broncos duels is 1-2.</p>
<p>On the bright side for the Broncos, they now have their best QB since Manning. Their signal-caller in 2022 is Russell Wilson. Although he hasn’t shown much this season, everyone is expecting him to explode any time soon.</p>
<p>Will it happen against the Niners? Oddsmakers don’t think so. Instead, they see the visiting team as the favorite to win the Week 3 game.</p>

<p>Jimmy G to Lead the San Francisco 49ers Offense</p>
<p>San Francisco’s starting quarterback Trey Lance suffered an injury last week, which will keep him sidelined for the entire season. Jimmy Garoppolo is the man who’s meant to step in as his replacement, a QB who led the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game in 2021.</p>
<p>So far this season, Garoppolo has played only one game – which he didn’t start – but he did relatively well. Jimmy G threw 13/21 for 154 yards and one touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 2, with no interceptions. He also made four carries, scoring one rushing touchdown along the way.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos Need to Start Playing Better</p>
<p>The Broncos are 1-1 in 2022 and the Week 3 game is going to be the first time this season that they’re not betting favorites. In Week 1, they were 6-point favorites in Russel Wilson’s revenge game. In Week 2, they were 11-point favorites against the Houston Texans at Mile High. They did win, but they failed to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Their performance in Week 2 was marred by several strange decisions by the head coach Nathaniel Hackett, as well as some embarrassing moves by their QB. Luckily for them, their opponent in that game was one of the worst teams in the NFL. In Week 3, the hardest job so far awaits them when the Niners come to Colorado.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers vs Denver Broncos Prediction</p>
<p>The Broncos really need to get the offense going. Averaging just 16.0 PPG in 2022 is simply embarrassing for a team whose quarterback is Russell Wilson. The QB needs to start showing he’s worth his $245 million contract.</p>
<p>Picks: Denver Broncos to win; under to hit</p>
