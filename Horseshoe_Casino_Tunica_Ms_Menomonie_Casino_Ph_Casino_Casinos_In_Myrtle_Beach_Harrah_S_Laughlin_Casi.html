    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Tunica Ms Menomonie Casino Ph Casino Casinos In Myrtle Beach Harrah S Laughlin Casi</h1>

<p>Hard Rock is looking to hire around 200 live dealers for its new casino resort in Indiana, multiple media sources report. The $300 million premier casino and entertainment destination, Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana, is scheduled to open doors in the spring of 2021.</p>
<p>Modern Casino Resort</p>
<p>Located adjacent to the 80/94 Burr Street Interchange, the premier 200,000-square foot entertainment complex will be the only casino with direct freeway access. It will feature a 1,954-seat Hard Rock Live performance venue, 5 food venues, among which Hard Rock Café, steaks and sea food restaurant and a noodle bar, as well as a retail shop. A 200-room hotel and a multi-level parking garage are set to be added during the second phase of the casino resort development.</p>
<p>The gaming floor of the casino will feature an on-site sports book and will have more than 1,600 slots and 80 table games, which will make the total gaming positions above 2,100, hence the need for the casino operator to hire new live dealers. Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana noted no experience is needed, as it is looking for job candidates which have great personalities.</p>
<p>Two Hiring Events</p>
<p>The casino operator which was recognized as a Forbes Magazine Top Employer for Women and a Top Employer for Diversity in 2020, will initially screen candidates for the dealer positions during two hiring events scheduled to take place at the Majestic Star Casino Pavilion in Gary, November 17 and November 19, and the selected ones for the jobs will be invited to attend a paid 8-to-12-week Dealer School training program.</p>
<p>During the period of training, job applicants will get acquainted in detail with each table game the casino will be offering and will practice extensively dealing games such as blackjack, craps and baccarat, among others. Dealer School training program graduates will be offered a job in the casino, a bonus of up to $2,000 and full benefits. The new recruits will be added to all current employees at Gary’s Majestic Star casinos, which, under Indiana law, will be transferred to Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana.</p>
<p>The new casino complex is estimated to generate in excess of $20 million in tax revenue and payments per year, but the overall economic effect for the region will be much higher as Hard Rock has a commitment to hire locally and invest and purchase from companies within the local community.</p>
<p>Hard Rock is involved in another casino development project, in Bristol, Virginia, where city residents voted in favor, 71%, of the gaming establishment during the Referendum vote November 3.</p>
