<p>While the Christmas Day game draws near, the Dolphins are just a few wins away from the playoffs while the Packers' chance of making it seem slim</p>
<p>Despite beating the Los Angeles Rams in the MNF game of Week 15, the Green Bay Packers still have only a tiny chance to make the playoffs. Even if they win all of their remaining games of the 2022 regular season, they will have a 5% chance to advance to the postseason.</p>
<p>If you take a look at their schedule, you’ll see that it’s not very likely they’re going to go 3-0 in the remainder of the season. The thing is that they get to play against three very tough opponents, starting with the Miami Dolphins on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>In fact, oddsmakers think they’re going to lose the Week 16 game to the boys from Florida, who too are in need of wins to secure a playoff berth.</p>

<p>The Dolphins are a Win (or Two) Away From the Playoffs</p>
<p>The Dolphins are a Win (or Two) Away From the PlayoffsIf the Miami Dolphins beat the Packers on Christmas Day, their chance of making the playoffs will go up to 81%. If they lose, however, it will drop to 56%. Of course, this doesn’t only have to do with them, but with other NFC teams as well. That said, in the best-case scenario, Mike McDaniel’s men could secure a playoff spot before the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s clear they’re going to take Sunday’s game very seriously. This goes especially because the alarms are ringing in their locker room after three straight losses. To be fair to them, each of those losses happened against really strong opponents – San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Chargers, and Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>The loss to the Bills happened last weekend at super-cold Highmark Stadium. Despite not being used to extreme weather conditions, Miami players actually did okay in that game, losing by just a field goal in the end.</p>
<p>The Packers Still Not Giving Up</p>
<p>If they lose to the Dolphins, their chance of making the playoffs will be virtually zero. Even if they win, it won’t improve much, which is very bad news for Aaron Rodgers &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Still, they don’t seem to care about it. At least, that’s the impression we get after their 24-12 win over the reigning NFL champions, the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>They beat them without any major problems last Monday, but to be fair to the Rams, they did play without a number of their key men in that game. That said, the Packers shouldn’t be too proud of their performance that evening.</p>
<p>Packers vs Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>In 2022, the Dolphins are a better team that the Packers. This goes especially for the games played on their turf. In sunny Miami, they’re 5-1 this season. The Christmas Day game against the Packers is going to be the Dolphins’ first (and only) home game in December. And we think they’re going to make it memorable for the fans!</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Dolphins to win and cover the spread.</p>
