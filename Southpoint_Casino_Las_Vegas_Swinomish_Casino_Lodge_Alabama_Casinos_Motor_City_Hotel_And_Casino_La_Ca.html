<p>Funanga is a fast-growing, Berlin-based instant cash payment services provider, delivering convenient solutions for online payment providers. The company has been continuously expanding its global reach and earlier this week celebrated its launch in North America. The provider unveiled a new deal with Payment Source’s Now Prepay, effectively expanding its services to Canada.</p>
<p>The launch into Canada marked a strategic achievement for Funanga. This is because thanks to the recent launch, the company’s CashtoCode service is now available on every continent, reaffirming the potential, popularity and convenience of the solution.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Now Prepay customers will benefit from Funanga’s CashtoCode service, allowing in-store cash payments, buying digital goods, as well as adding funds for e-wallets and digital accounts. Under the terms of the new deal, more than 15,000 Now Prepay retail locations, including post offices, around Canada can benefit from the CashtoCode service.</p>
<p>As much as a milestone moment the entry in Canada is, Funanga explained it plans to continue growing further. The company said that besides Canada, it plans to expand further in North America. One strategic market that Funanga plans to penetrate is the United States. The instant cash payment service provider said that it seeks to enter the US early next year.</p>
<p>“A launch in North America was a key target for Funanga at the start of 2023, and a Canadian integration was requested from several Funanga merchants and many customers who wanted to use the service in the region. With this expansion, Funanga’s CashtoCode service is now available on every continent,“ explains a statement released by Funanga</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Excited to Join Forces</p>
<p>Jason Groulx, Payment Source’s vice president of merchant services, explained that Funanga’s solution, CashtoCode, is a secure and reliable payment solution that benefits Now Prepay customers. He explained that the company remains committed to offering solutions from trusted and secure providers.</p>
<p>At the same time, Groulx acknowledged that Payment Source is also exploring possibilities for delivering innovative payment options for its growing customer base. “We are delighted to add Funanga’s hugely popular CashtoCode service to our portfolio and look forward to a long and successful partnership,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“CashtoCode offers a reliable, secure, and inclusive alternate payment option for our customers.“ Jason Groulx, vice president of merchant services at Payment Source</p>
<p>Jens Bader, Funanga’s CEO, was excited about the company’s expansion to North America, explaining that it will help brands and online merchants. “Many of our existing merchants have a strong user base in Canada and we hope to develop more relationships across the country,” he added. Finally, Bader said he hopes that the Canadian entry of Funanga will help propel the company to the US as well.</p>
