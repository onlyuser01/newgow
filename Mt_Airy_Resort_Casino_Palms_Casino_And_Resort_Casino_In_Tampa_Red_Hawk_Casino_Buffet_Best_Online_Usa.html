<p>Hollywoodbets and Pragmatic Play have expanded on their partnership in South Africa and will now collaborate for iGaming, Live Casino, and Virtual Sports titles in Ireland and the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Hollywood and Pragmatic Together in New Partnership</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play continues to build upon its momentum in the iGaming industry. The latest partnership involving Pragmatic Play is about the company’s operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland where it has teamed up with Hollywoodbets and where it will now extend this pre-existing collaboration with the operator, boosting the reach of its products.</p>
<p>The pair have already worked in other markets around the world. One of those is South Africa where Pragmatic Play built a strong rapport and relationship with the company and where it extended its own award-winning range of slots and iGaming products, including Live Casino and Virtual Sports portfolio.</p>
<p>As a result of this renewed partnership, Pragmatic Play will deploy its range of 250 titles with Hollywoodbets which will make it possible for local players to enjoy top choices such as Big Bass Splash, Gates of Olympus, and Gorilla Mayhem, which are some of the company’s latest and best-known games in the industry.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also well-positioned to bring other aspects of the experience to bear, including the Live Casino library which will deliver an excellent overall experience with Boom City, a game show live title along with Sweet Bonanza CandyLand, and Mega Wheel. All of these games have been able to innovate and improve on the original iGaming experience by a fair bit.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is particularly proud of the release of its Virtual Sports titles that will help Hollywoodbets establish a true multi-vertical presence and deliver quality products to gaming crowds in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Opportunity to Grow Together</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play business development officer Yossi Barzely welcomed this opportunity and said that the company will be able to increase its product reach through the localized push in one of the most significant markets in Europe. He added:</p>
<p>It’s fantastic news to be able to work with them in additional markets, especially in the biggest European market which will allow for further brand exposure and lead generation. Pragmatic Play business development officer Yossi Barzely</p>
<p>Hollywoodbets betting operations manager Dermot O’Connell welcomed the opportunity and said that customers will be able to enjoy premium entertaining and thrilling experiences. Pragmatic is an ideal partner for the future of Hollywoodbets, O’Connell assured.</p>
