<p>Gaming Innovation Group Inc. has signed a new partnership with Strike Games, an iGaming operator, with the new alliance focusing on casino products. Strike Games will have the unique opportunity to leverage GiG’s innovative platform and technology to reach new audiences and deliver a sounder product that strikes home with players in existing and emerging markets.</p>
<p>GiG is particularly well-positioned to aid new operators such as Strike Games to secure further ground in markets, as it relies on its own advanced full-stack system to create a robust platform that empowers brands to bring the best possible iGaming experience to their customers.</p>
<p>GiG’s platform is precisely what Strike Games needs to ensure that its experience in operating and marketing iGaming products will lead to greater results across the board for both companies, as well as their target audiences.</p>
<p>Both companies have confirmed that they are seeking to give players an unmatched iGaming experience that lasts, engages, and immerses players to the max. Strike Games Director James Pound welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with GiG and said that the company’s world-class technology was precisely what Strike needed to move forward.</p>
<p>He added that thanks to this new opportunity, Strike Games will be able to improve the standard of iGaming experience it delivers for its customers and launch a new-age gaming platform in the process.</p>
<p>Strike Games is confident that this partnership is the right step forward for the company as the operator is signing up the tie-up for the next nine years, which will see GiG deliver on both its content management system and player account management, CMS, and PAM respectively.

<p>GiG’s latest partnership with Strike Games comes in the context of more good news for the company. The tech developer and supplier for the industry realized strong third-quarter results and has been actively expanding its bottom line. In September, GiG signed with another partner, Merkur, a prominent German-based iGaming operator that runs in the highly-regulated market in the industry.</p>
