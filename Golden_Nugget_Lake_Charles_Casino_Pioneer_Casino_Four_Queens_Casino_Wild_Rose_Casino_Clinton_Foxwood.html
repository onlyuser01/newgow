<p>Join the Tribe and Start Collecting Wins</p>
<p>The action is introduced to players through two Native American tribe members, a man and a woman ready to clear the path to some lucrative wins. The beautifully designed 3×5 grid is set against a mesmerizing background showing a gorgeous sunset right in the heart of the rolling plains along with three totems to the left of the grid.</p>
<p>The symbols complement the theme with specific bison, eagle, and tribe member icons along with classic ace, king, queen, and jack card symbols. The symbols together with the substitute wild symbol are presented in stacks on the reels. This means they cut the variance of the game and make regular wins easier to hit.</p>
<p>Three Re-Spins Features and Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who manage to collect the diamond symbols unlock three bonus respin features in the game. The diamonds have three different colors: green, red, and blue. Every time one of them is seen popping on the reels, it is added to its corresponding totem located on the left side of the grid.</p>
<p>Green diamonds reach the green Random Wild totem modifier, while Blue diamonds engage the x2 Wild totem modifier. Landing a red diamond triggers the Expand Reels feature through the corresponding modifier.</p>
<p>Each of these three actions engages an extra re-spin on the reels. With the help of three red diamond symbols, players can expand the reels to a total of 75 paylines. Landing a trio made of blue diamonds will make all the wild symbols popping on the reels double the value of the potential wins they might trigger.</p>
<p>Seeing three green diamond symbols show up will add five to ten random wilds to the reels for more lucrative payouts. Engaged modifiers’ counters are reset to zero, which means players are given the chance to keep collecting more in hopes of reactivating their power.</p>
<p>The game’s greatest wins are triggered in the Free Spins feature which can be entered when landing a minimum of three bonus icons on any location. Players are given eight Free Spins while the diamond counters on the left-sided totems will have their counters reset to one. A new diamond symbol popping now will instantly cause its modifier to grant an extra Free Spin.</p>
<p>Risk Feature</p>
<p>This means players can benefit from indefinite spins and potentially enjoy several rewards during a single trigger. The slot also allows players to use all wins collected in base game in the optional Risk feature.</p>
<p>Here, players need to try to guess the color of a hidden playing card and this way double their current win. A maximum of eight Risk rounds are available.</p>
<p>Swintt’s chief executive officer David Mann Swintt has expressed his belief that the fresh release will turn into a great hit for players once it will make its debut at all of their online casino partners in March.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, the company announced it would supply Bragg Gaming with its Premium and Select content.</p>
