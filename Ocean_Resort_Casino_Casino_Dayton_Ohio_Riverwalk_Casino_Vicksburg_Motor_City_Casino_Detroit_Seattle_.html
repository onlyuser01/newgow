    <h1>Ocean Resort Casino Casino Dayton Ohio Riverwalk Casino Vicksburg Motor City Casino Detroit Seattle</h1>

<p>Hello Roger,</p>
<p>I am sure you are extremely busy. So I apologize for getting you involved in something you will probably think is extremely trivial.</p>
<p>I understand if you don’t want to waste your time reading my long winded email. The point of this is to be paid what I am rightfully owed by your casino. At the bottom of the page I listed the deposits I had made to you casino, just in the last two months alone.</p>
<p>I won what probably will seem to you as a very insignificant amount of money. I won .033BTC. , I had made an initial deposit of .0017.</p>
<p>I was told the decision was made not to pay me because someone has created another account using the internet. I have no clue who it would have been, but I can tell you with absolute certainty it would have been someone who would have ended up making a deposit to your casino.</p>
<p>I’m am asking to be paid what I believe is owed to me. If the decision is made to pay me and you want to keep me as a client I will continue making deposits. If I am paid and given assurances that this won’t happen to me again. I am totally willing to chalk this up as one of your staff members having a bad night and discarding a withdrawal that should have been paid immediately.</p>
<p>I welcome you to read the entire email, but that basically sums up my issue.</p>
<p>Moving forward,</p>
<p>Before I go any further, I wanted to also make sure I apologize to your staff if I came off as being a jerk because I am not a jerk at all, I was just extremely angry that after making so many deposits and feeling like a true Vip that I could be treated so poorly. I just feel like after investing thousands into your casino. It’s crazy to think I would have an issue regarding a withdraw when I finally won. It’s not even an absorbent amount of money. Especially when the only time I had withdrawn money was due to a non-deposit bonus given to me by the vip team without even asking for the bonus. It wasn’t a lot and I think I pretty much redeposited it back to your casino.</p>
<p>I digress, let me get to the point of my frustration, apparently there was another account opened, it wasn’t me, however I had a Eurchre party and told everyone about the casino. They apparently opened accounts using my WiFi or remote control. I haven’t been able to get a straight answer.</p>
<p>I won .033btc, that’s roughly $650 bucks, not even remotely close to what I have deposited into the casino.</p>
<p>I didn’t enter any bonus code, however, your casino automatically applies a match bonus on your first deposit of the day. Fortunately I was able to get through the play through, the only reason I don’t indicate that I don’t want bonuses is due to the no deposit bonuses you folks offer occasionally. So I made a deposit of .0017btc. After winning from withdraw was discarded and eventually my account balance was reduced to the original deposit amount.</p>
<p>Now what’s even crazier is that since this incident I have received email marketing request asking me to use the casino. In fact they want to apply a match bonus if I am willing to make a deposit. Why ?</p>
<p>Why would you send a client marketing emails, offering match bonuses after you discarded a withdraw because you said someone else opened an account with my IP address.</p>
<p>What are you trying to accomplish by offering bonuses knowing you didn’t pay me the last time I made a deposit.</p>
<p>This is very important to me. I eagerly await a response, I have a list of other members of the brass and other folks associated with the casino. I just want to give you another opportunity before getting anyone else involved. Again, I think your product is top notch, from the gaming to the folks handling your chat and customer service. In fact until now, I even raved about your vip staff. Unfortunately I won’t lie, Tom is obviously not on my Christmas card list this year.</p>
<p>I would love to remain a client, but I totally understand if after paying me, the decision is made to end our relationship. I would completely understand, but I feel like I am owed the amount of the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Here is a list of my deposit in the last two months.</p>
