<p>Sean Strickland vs. Abusupiyan Magomedov is the main event of UFC on ESPN 48, which will take place on Saturday, July 1, 20233, at UFC Apex in Vegas</p>
<p>You might be surprised that Abus Magomedov is headlining a UFC event considering that he’s fought only once in this promotion. But the fight in question saw him put his opponent to sleep after just 19 seconds.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why Strickland decided to agree on a fight against an unranked opponent, it’s because “Tarzan” believes that another win would open the door to the championship fight for him.</p>

<p>Sean Strickland To Give His Utmost on July 1</p>
<p>Sean Strickland (26-5) says he gets homicidal urges when he gets inside the octagon. Well, he’ll have to use his anger on Saturday if he wants to win. But it’s not just about the fighting spirit; this fight is also about strategy and stamina.</p>
<p>Luckily for “Tarzan,” he’s got all the ingredients needed to put on a good fight in the UFC on ESPN 48 headliner. We already know that he’s a guy who never quits, even if it means getting beaten up. He did get finished twice so far, but it happened against Alex Pereira and Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos, two incredible strikers.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems that he’s upped his strike defense since those losses. For instance, he managed to take the fight with hard-hitting Jared Cannonier to the distance in his return to the octagon after the Pereira defeat. Then, in his most recent fight, he defeated Nassourdine Imamov in a light heavyweight fight.</p>
<p>You now know that he’s got the determination, as well as the skillset needed to do well against the fast-handed Magomedov. But does he have the stamina to sustain the punches and kicks thrown at him by the Dagestani fighter (and vice versa)?</p>
<p>Sure, he does. The proof is that “Tarzan” lasted until the final bell in five of his last six UFC fights. And four of those were 5-round bouts.</p>
<p>Things You Need to Know About Abus Magomedov</p>
<p>Abusupiyan Magomedov has only fought in the UFC once, which is why it’s surprising that his odds aren’t longer than +140. The reason for that is that bettors keep putting money on him. If you’re wondering what makes him such an interesting betting option, there are several facts you need to learn about.</p>
<p>First of all, he’s from Dagestan, and like all the other MMA fighters from this part of the world, he too is an excellent wrestler. However, his strongest weapon is striking. He’s got fast hands and immense power, which explains why his knockout-to-win ratio is 56%.</p>
<p>Another reason why betting aficionados have fallen in love with the Soviet-born fighter is that he demolished his opponent on his UFC debut. Magomedov defeated Dustin Stoltzfus after only 19 seconds.</p>
<p>Sean Strickland vs. Abusupiyan Magomedov Prediction</p>
<p>Sean Strickland should win this, but it’s not going to be an easy win. Instead, we’ll probably see the two exchange strikes for 25 minutes, after which, we predict, the judges will score “Tarzan” as the winner. We think he’ll simply land more strikes than his opponent, and perhaps even make a few takedowns.</p>
