<p>Betfred, one of the world's leading independent bookmakers, has declared the launch of their new sportsbook in Nevada - the Betfred at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook</p>
<p>This marks the company’s first move into the Nevada sports betting market.</p>
<p>Betfred’s New Sportsbook Opens Doors on February 9</p>
<p>The new sportsbook, located inside the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, part of Curio Collection by Hilton, will open its doors on Thursday, February 9.</p>
<p>Betfred was given the green light to manage sports betting at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook by the Nevada Gaming Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board on January 25. The company is eager to unveil their latest venture, which is expected to impress sports fans with its modern facilities and top-notch amenities, such as luxury seating and high-definition TVs.</p>
<p>Betfred USA Sports, based in Las Vegas, was established in 2019 by the UK-based Betfred Group. The group, founded in 1967 by brothers Fred and Peter Done, operates over 1,400 betting shops across the UK.</p>
<p>At the Betfred at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook, visitors can expect a wide range of betting options, including parlays, in-game wagering, teasers, futures, props, and more. The sportsbook, run by Mohegan Sun Casino Las Vegas, will be managed by Betfred and offer sports pool services, as well as race book and off-track pari-mutuel race wagering. Patrons must be 21 years or older to participate.</p>
<p>Meet and Greet with NFL Star Elbert Woods Will Kick Off the New Sportsbook</p>
<p>To commemorate the opening of the Betfred at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook a special guest will be kicking off the festivities on February 9. Elbert “Ickey” Woods, former UNLV Rebels football player and Cincinnati Bengals legend, will be placing the first bet at the sportsbook at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Famous for his “Ickey Shuffle” touchdown celebration, Woods made a big impact in the NFL and still holds several records. In addition to his football career, Woods is also a member of the UNLV Athletics Hall Of Fame and holds the school’s rushing records.</p>
<p>After placing the first bet, Woods will be hosting a meet and greet session, open to the public.</p>
<p>According to Richard “Boz” Bosworth, President and CEO of JC Hospitality, which owns Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, the new Betfred at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook will offer a captivating array of betting options that will appeal to both sports enthusiasts and casual visitors alike.</p>
<p>Bosworth further added:</p>
<p>The timing of the opening couldn’t be more ideal with the new partnership between the Vegas Golden Knights and Betfred Sports and as the resort prepares to welcome football fans from across the country to enjoy the championship game. Richard “Boz” Bosworth, president &amp; CEO, JC Hospitality</p>
<p>Betfred announced its partnership with Vegas Golden Knights just last week.</p>
<p>Joe Hasson, General Manager at Mohegan Casino Las Vegas, also expressed his excitement to see the partnership between Betfred and the casino come to fruition in Nevada. He noted that the Betfred at Mohegan Sun Sportsbook is poised to become a popular destination for sports fans looking for a convenient and comfortable sports betting experience.</p>
