<p>Unikrn is strengthening its portfolio of available payment providers through a newly-minted partnership with Nuvei. Nuvei will add a powerful payment solution allowing Unikrn to maximize payment processing power as well as facilitate withdrawal options for a global customer base.</p>
<p>Presently, Unikrn operates in 24 markets and 41 states in the United States. Thanks to Nuvei, Unikrn may now use up to 450 alternative payment methods and 150 unique currencies, allowing esports enthusiasts to feel at home settling bets and requesting winning withdrawals from the websites.</p>

Click below for the details.https://t.co/cT8kzj5FRN#PressRelease #NuveiNews #PaymentProcessingNews #FintechNews — Nuvei (@NuveiTech) November 25, 2020</p>
<p>Nuvei will have a unique Cashier section which will facilitate deposits and withdrawals for Unikrn’s consumer base, making for a simple operability for the end user. Commenting on this partnership, Unikrn co-founder Rahul Sood said that the company remained committed to gaming experiences without interruption.</p>
<p>By adding Nuvei, Unikrn was looking to make the payment journey safer and seamless, Sood explained. Nuvei Managing Director of Digital Payments Yuval Zid said that the company was committed to innovating the payment experience and providing gaming operators with the tools necessary to scale their offer domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Unikrn Undisturbed by SEC Ruling in ICO Case</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a decision in the case against Unikrn Inc., accusing the operator of launching an unauthorized initial coin offering (ICO) of digital asset securities.</p>
<p>Unirkn has agreed to admit fault, paying a $6.1 million fine as part of the settlement with the regulator. SEC said that Unikrn successfully raised $31 million for its UnikoinGold (UKG) during June and October 2017.</p>
<p>At the time, Unikrn told investors that the ICO was a pre-cursor to facilitating and beefing up demand for the token. From SEC’s standpoint, though, Unikrn sold tokens as investment contracts, which are a type of security, but the company has failed to register those tokens as securities.</p>
<p>Toughening Up Stance against Fraud</p>
<p>Since this incident, Unikrn has been on the straight and narrow, revving up its efforts to uphold industry standards. Earlier in November, the company teamed up with SEON, a company specializing in fraud prevention.</p>
<p>As per the partnership, the company will assist Unikrn to identify users who may be using multiple accounts to commit fraud including but not limited to bonus abuse.</p>
