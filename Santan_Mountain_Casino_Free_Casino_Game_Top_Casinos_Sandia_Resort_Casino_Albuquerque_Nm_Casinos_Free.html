<p>Is Olympiacos the Best Basketball Team in Europe in 2023?</p>
<p>The Greek powerhouse finished top of the EuroLeague table in the regular season. Olympiacos went 24-10 in the regular season, which saw their forward Aleksandar Vezenkov put on some really vintage performances. In fact, he was so good that the EuroLeague awarded him the MVP prize for the 2022-23 season.</p>

<p>Vezenkov led the league in PIR with a average of 21.2 per game and led the league in points per game averaging 17.2 points 🔥</p>

<p>The best thing is that his teammates weren’t much behind him in terms of performance. Kostas Papanikolaou, Kostas Sloukas, Shaquielle Mckissic, Moustapha Fall, and many other Olympiacos players were absolutely fantastic in the regular season.</p>
<p>Most of them continued to play well in the playoffs, even though they did somewhat struggle against Fenerbahce. Even though it wasn’t an easy series, the Greeks eventually won 3-2, thus booking the ticket to the EuroLeague Final 4.</p>
<p>Then, in the semifinal, they steamrolled Monaco 76-62. It was expected if we’re being frank as Monaco is the worst team of all that qualified for the F4 tournament in Lithuania. On Sunday, however, Olympiacos have a much tougher task on their hands.</p>
<p>Real Madrid Ready for Another Upset?</p>
<p>Los Blancos are coming to Kaunas as +150 underdogs, but this doesn’t seem to bother them much. After all, they’ve just staged a big upset in the semifinal. They were +215 underdogs against Barcelona in the last game, but they ended up smashing their archrivals 78-66.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it’s Barca’s fault really. These guys played horrible basketball on Friday, with their best player Nikola Mirotic scoring just 3 points. Sure, Real Madrid players did great defensively, especially Edy Tavares who’s arguably the best defensive player outside the NBA.</p>
<p>Still, despite impressing against Barca, the boys in white haven’t been too convincing in the 2023 postseason. The best example is the playoff series against Partizan Belgrade, which saw them struggle a lot.</p>
<p>They went 2-0 down after two games in Madrid, both of which saw a lot of controversy. Their players got into a fight with the opposition, the result of which was that a couple of Partizan’s key men ended up suspended. It’s not an overstatement to say that it helped Real turn the series in their favor.</p>
<p>Olympiacos and Real Madrid 2023 EuroLeague Final Prediction</p>
<p>We think Olympiacos will destroy Real Madrid on Sunday. If you compare them player-for-player, Olympiacos might not seem too superior. However, the Greeks have been functioning great as a collective. They just need another big push to end their wonderful campaign in style.</p>
<p>That said, we can see no other scenario but Olympiacos winning the game, covering the spread along the way.</p>
<p>Pick: Olympiacos to win and cover the spread</p>
