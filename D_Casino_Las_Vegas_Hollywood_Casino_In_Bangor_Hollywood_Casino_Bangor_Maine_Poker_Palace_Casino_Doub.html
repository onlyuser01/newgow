<p>Betsperts Group will provide the support and resources to help Bleacher Nation fulfill their shared vision for the future</p>
<p>Fantasy sports and sports betting media specialist Betsperts Group announced the acquisition of Bleacher Nation in a cash plus equity deal to mark the group’s fourth acquisition in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>‘Impressive Track Record of Growth’</p>
<p>With the addition of Bleacher Nation, a sports media outlet covering sports from Chicago and across the nation, Betsperts Group expanded its audience to over 25 million unique users, with over 225 million page views in the past year.</p>
<p>“Bleacher Nation has built an incredible relationship with Chicago fans and sports fans all over the world,” said Betsperts Group chief executive officer Reid Rooney, eager to continue building “their impressive track record of growth” via new content coverage and additional resources.</p>
<p>Bleacher Nation is the fourth major transaction executed by the group founded in 2018, joining Matthew Berry’s Fantasy Life App, www.4for4.com, and www.Dynastyleaguefootball.com, and is expected to help the group to expand its presence further.</p>
<p>‘Shared Vision for the Future’</p>
<p>Michael Cerami, vice president of Strategic Growth at Bleacher Nation, outlined that the group and Bleacher Nation shared a “vision for the future” and that future would have been impossible to reach “without the additional support and resources of Betsperts.”</p>
<p>“We are thrilled and excited to become a part of Betsperts Group, and we are confident our readers are going to love what comes next,” Cerami concluded.</p>
<p>In 2022, Betsperts Group registered revenue growth of over 350% and is projected to become profitable in 2023, and with already diversified revenue streams from subscriptions, affiliate partnerships and advertising, Rooney is anticipating two exciting growth years for the business ahead.</p>
<p>Speaking about what comes next, Rooney paid tribute to the support and belief Betsperts Group has been receiving from its investors, especially after the first $3 million Series A2 funding round and the previous $8.6 million Series A funding round with the participation of Verance Capital, HBSE Ventures, Parlay Capital, and Velo Partners. “We are excited to finalize the rest of this raise in January or February and make sure we are executing our strategy moving forward,” he added.</p>
<p>Betsperts Group’s list of investors also includes early investors David VanEgmond and Matthew Berry, as well as popular personalities such as Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Eva Longoria, Kyle Busch, Darius Rucker, Adam Wainwright, Richard Jefferson, and Jesse Itzler.</p>
<p>Home to one of the largest sports betting and fantasy sports audiences in the US, Betsperts Group is set to grow to 45 employees across 6 different countries after the acquisition of Bleacher Nation.</p>
