<p>GGPoker, the leading online poker room, announced Monday that it plans to sponsor Triton Poker for its upcoming events.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, the leading poker room will sponsor Triton Poker’s Cyprus Special Edition event. What is more, the collaboration between GGPoker and Triton Poker designates the former as the official partner of the tournament.</p>
<p>The prestigious poker tournament is scheduled to take place from April 2 through April 7, 2022, at the Merit Hotel and Casino in Cyprus. The six-day Special Edition Super High Roller series will offer multiple games such as No-Limit Hold’em 6 and 8-hand. Moreover, tournament participants would also be able to enjoy short deck tournaments.</p>
<p>Triton Poker Series’ CEO, Andy Wong, said that it is thrilling to join forces with a premier partner such as GGPoker. Moreover, he explained that the company has significant experience within the online gaming industry. According to Wong, GGPoker is also “renowned for being at the forefront of developing innovative games and features.” He pointed out that live coverage has been a key for Triton Poker. Now, according to Wong, this partnership will help “enhance the thrills and spills our fans have come to enjoy at our exclusive events.”</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome GGPoker as our premier partner this season.” Andy Wong, CEO of Triton Poker Series</p>
<p>John Scanlon, GGPoker’s director of sponsorships and live events, added that taking live poker to a new level was the main goal for Triton since the launch of the series. Additionally, he explained that the quality of the production and the engagement with the community are more important than the famous players or the size of the buy-ins. In conclusion, Scanlon revealed that the new collaboration will bring unique experiences for the poker players.</p>
<p>“This partnership is the perfect synergy between two brands aligned with a common goal to bring poker to the masses through premium product offerings.” John Scanlon, director of sponsorships and live events at GGPoker</p>
<p>The news about the new sponsorship deal with Triton Poker comes after only recently, GGPoker dismissed rumors about Dan Bilzerian stepping down from his role as ambassador. In fact, the company went on Twitter to confirm that the famous Armenian-American poker player, businessman and social media star will keep his position as a brand ambassador.</p>
