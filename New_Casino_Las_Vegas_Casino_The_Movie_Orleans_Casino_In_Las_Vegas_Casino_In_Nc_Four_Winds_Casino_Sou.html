    <h1>New Casino Las Vegas Casino The Movie Orleans Casino In Las Vegas Casino In Nc Four Winds Casino Sou</h1>

<p>So I deposited 250 BRL and got another 250 BRL to play. I was only playing at the sports section, no casino. Ok so far. The rollover was 2500 BRL. For starters, they were unfair, because all the bets I placed, even those with real money, the winnings would go to the bonus fund. The maximum bonus you could transfer to money was 2500BRL (deposit x10).</p>
<p>Ok, so after I completing the rollover, I am with 945BRL on my account. I did the KYC, sendind my passport and my proof of adress. Two days after, I received an email, saying my KYC was completed.</p>
<p>So, I request the withdraw. 3 days later, they send me an email, that they need a selfie of me holding my document. I sen them. 3 more days, nad I receive confirmation.</p>
<p>I request the the withdraw again. Three more days, they cancel my request and say they need a proof that the phone number is really mine. I explain that the fist proof of adress, was already my phone bill. They say it is okay.</p>
<p>One more time, I request a withdraw. 3 days later, they want me to send another proof of id. I already sent the passport and the selfie holding it. What document could be possibly more safe than a passport?</p>
<p>So, I just sent my drivers license a couple hours ago. But, of course, this looks to me like a scam.</p>
<p>That is it, I wish I had read the reviews on this site before I started to use it.</p>
