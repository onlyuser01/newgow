<p>Four games feature two teams ranked in the Top 25, but the Big 10 matchup is expected to generate the most Las Vegas betting action. Michigan State is coming off a marquee win over then-No. 8 Penn State, and looks to play the role of spoiler again, but this time at home in East Lansing.</p>
<p>However, Michigan arrives in strong stride, as the Wolverines knocked off No. 15 Wisconsin 38-13 a week ago at home. The next three weeks will define Michigan’s year, as they play Michigan State tomorrow, and then host No. 18 Penn State after a bye week.</p>
<p>As for this week, the Westgate SuperBook has Michigan a touchdown favorite over the Spartans, and the over/under at 41 points. Michigan vs. Michigan State kicks off at 12:00 pm ET.</p>
<p>Top 25 Games</p>
<p>Saturday features three other games where two teams ranked inside the Top 25 will square off.</p>
<p>After the Michigan-Michigan State game, No. 16 NC State (5-0) travels south to play No. 3 Clemson (6-0) in an ACC battle of unbeatens. But Las Vegas gives the traveling Wolfpack little chance of pulling off the upset, as the home team Tigers are favored by 17.5 points. NC State and Clemson kicks off at 3:30 pm ET.</p>
<p>Another team perhaps on upset alert is No. 5 LSU (6-1), as they welcome No. 22 Mississippi State (4-2). The Tigers are favored by 6.5 points, but the Bulldogs are fresh off a win against then-No. 8 Auburn.</p>
<p>No. 12 Oregon at No. 25 Washington State is the final ranked vs. ranked game, and features the closest spread. The home team Cougars are favored by just a field goal over the visiting Ducks. Washington State doesn’t have a win over a ranked opponent, and Oregon is fresh off wins at then-No. 24 Cal and at home against then-No. 7 Washington.</p>
<p>Alabama Final Warmup</p>
<p>In college football, there’s Alabama and then everyone else. The No. 1 Crimson Tide (7-0) play at Tennessee (3-3) on Saturday at 3:30 pm ET. It will presumably be coach Nick Saban’s last week for nearly a month where his program is favored by more than three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Alabama is a 28.5-point favorite on the road against the Volunteers. But after Saturday, the Crimson Tide will finally play back-to-back games that should pose at least the treat of an upset.</p>
<p>Alabama will travel to Death Valley on November 3 to play at LSU, and then the following weekend welcome Mississippi State to Tuscaloosa.</p>
<p>As for college football futures, Alabama remains the heavy favorite. Online sportsbook Bovada lists the Crimson Tide at -175, or implied odds of winning the College Football Playoff National Championship a staggering 63.6 percent.</p>
<p>Clemson is next at +500, followed by Ohio State (+600), Notre Dame (+950), and Michigan (+1200).</p>
