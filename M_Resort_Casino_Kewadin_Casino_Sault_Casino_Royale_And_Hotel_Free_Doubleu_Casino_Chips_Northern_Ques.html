<p>We are sure that our customers would appreciate the diversity of their content and enjoy the new games. Yahale Meltzer, COO, GrooveGaming</p>
<p>Other Recent Developments Involving the Two Companies</p>
<p>The agreement follows other developments for CT Interactive. A few days ago, the content provider expanded its presence in Italy thanks to an agreement with the Italian operator Slot Plus. This launch was important for the supplier which was proud that its portfolio was accepted in the Italian gaming market.</p>
<p>In February, CT Interactive also penned an agreement with QTech Games. This agreement was also negotiated during ICE London 2023 and will see the companies collaborate in Asia, Europe, LATAM and Africa.</p>
<p>Last year, GrooveGaming sealed a major content deal with the Georgia-based gaming studio SmartSoft. The latter company considered this deal a privilege as it was excited to grow its global footprint with GrooveGaming.</p>
