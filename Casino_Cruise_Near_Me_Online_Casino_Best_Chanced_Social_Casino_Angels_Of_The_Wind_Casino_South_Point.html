<p>CS: GO generated most of the total betting volume on LOOT.BET in 2020, followed by Dota 2 in 2nd place and League of Legends in 3rd.</p>
<p>Main Ranking of Esports Betting Markets</p>
<p>Bookmaker LOOT.BET has recently released its eSports betting statistics for the past year. According to the data, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is once again responsible for the lion’s share of betting volumes for 2020.</p>
<p>CS: GO generated around 53% of the total betting volume on LOOT.BET last year, completely outshining every other form of competitive eSports discipline. The biggest single bet winnings from CS: GO reached as high as €6 540 (around $ 7 896) in 2020.</p>
<p>The difference between the top three games is quite steep, though the games themselves are not surprising. Dota 2 takes second place with a 35% share of the betting volume, while League of Legends comes in third with only 7%.</p>
<p>In an interesting twist, FIFA 21 took fourth place in betting volume last year. The EA flagship did not enjoy much fanfare in the previous years, so it is definitely a surprise seeing it come so close to the established eSports titans. It is possible that the indefinite suspension of real-life soccer may have something to do with its newfound popularity.</p>
<p>Valorant is another interesting development. The game is a free-to-play multiplayer tactical first-person hero shooter developed by Riot Games – the developer behind League of Legends. Being a relative newcomer – released in June last year – it managed to beat mainstays like Overwatch and Rocket League for the seventh spot in sheer betting volume.</p>
<p>Secondary Statistics and Winners</p>
<p>In terms of average bet size, the games switch positions quite a bit. League of Legends takes the first spot with an average bet of €32.34 ($39.04), narrowly beating out King of Glory’s €30.65 ($37.00). The two games with the highest betting volume – CS: GO and Dota 2 -take 10th and 11th spot respectively. Their average bet size is €21.41 ($25.85) and €20.64 ($24.92), respectively.</p>
<p>The most successful events for the three main winners, at least in terms of sheer bet volume sizes, are:</p>
<p>ESL One Road to Rio (CS:GO)</p>
<p>Epic League (Dota 2)</p>
<p>Legends Pro League Summer (LoL).</p>
<p>In regard to eSports teams in the “big three” games, the statistics classify them on the basis of five parameters: betting volume, average bet size, highest single wager, highest winnings for bettors and profit on every EUR placed. And the winners are:</p>
<p>Betting Volume: Na’Vi (CS: GO), Team Nigma (Dota 2) and T1 (LoL)</p>
<p>(CS: GO), (Dota 2) and (LoL) Average bet size: Team Liquid (CS:GO), Just Error (Dota 2) and Victory Five (LoL)</p>
<p>(CS:GO), (Dota 2) and (LoL) Highest wager: Heroic (CS:GO), Team Aster ( Dota 2), and DAMWON Gaming (LoL)</p>
<p>(CS:GO), Dota 2), and (LoL) Winnings for bettors: Sprout (CS:GO), VP.Prodigy (Dota 2), and FlyQuest (LoL)</p>
<p>(CS:GO), (Dota 2), and (LoL) Profit per EUR placed: Gambit (CS:GO), 496 Gaming (Dota 2), and LDLC OL (LoL)</p>
