<p>This will notably mark the second time a FIFA Women’s World Cup event is being monitored by a task force</p>
<p>The United Lotteries for Integrity in Sports (ULIS), a mutualized monitoring body dedicated to stopping corruption in sports, has been selected to protect the ongoing FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 from fraud. In this position, the ULIS is tasked with monitoring the betting markets throughout the event and identifying potential suspicious activity.</p>
<p>The ULIS was selected for the position during a meeting of the FIFA Integrity Task Force, which it is a member of. The preliminary meeting was held on July 20 and was attended by other members of the Task Force as well.</p>
<p>Major international organizations such as the Council of Europe, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, INTERPOL and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime participated in the meeting and oversaw the designation of ULIS as the body responsible for the betting integrity of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023.</p>
<p>The professional women’s sporting event will take place from July 20 to August 20. The event is jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The ULIS Will Shield the Tournament from Corruption</p>
<p>The FIFA Integrity Task Force is an alliance that seeks to protect one of the biggest soccer associations from the manipulation of betting markets and match outcomes. As a member, the ULIS is responsible for waging war on fraud and protecting the sector from corruption.</p>
<p>As the body responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023, the ULIS will leverage its monitoring intelligence and expertise to crack down on suspicious activities. In addition, the body will promote fair play throughout the competition.</p>
<p>To protect the league from fraud, the ULIS will also rely on the ULIS Monitoring and Intelligence Group, a collaborative platform that serves as a fixed international lottery task force that encompasses ULIS members and a team of industry experts.</p>
<p>This will notably mark the second time a FIFA Women’s World Cup event is being monitored by a task force. The first time, for reference, was in 2019.</p>
<p>The ULIS Continues to Grow with New Members</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the ULIS welcomed a bunch of new members. In late May, the integrity body was joined by the Spillemyndigheden, Denmark’s official gambling regulator.</p>
<p>Two months earlier, the ULIS also welcomed the British Columbia Lottery on board. Around the same time, the monitoring body also welcomed Playtech as an associate member.</p>
<p>The latest official member of the body is NeoGames.</p>
