    <h1>Casino In Toronto Area Big Dollar Casino No Deposit Bonus Table Mountain Casino Buffet San Juan Marr</h1>

<p>GeoComply is coming to the Snoqualmie Casino in Washington State. According to a company announcement from yesterday, the casino has become the first tribal casino in the state to offer on-site sports betting.</p>
<p>Mobile Sports Betting Arrives at Snoqualmie</p>
<p>GeoComply will deliver its PinPoint solution to the Snoqualmie Casino. The technology allows guests to place bets on their mobile devices at the Snoqualmie property without having to wait in line at kiosks or terminals. It also gives the tribe the ability to offer in-play sports betting options.</p>
<p>PinPoint GM Sam Basile explains, “To permit patrons to wager from within the Snoqualmie Casino and its immediate surroundings, while excluding areas like their convenience store, is a complex geolocation requirement that is made possible by our PinPoint technology. We are excited to be part of this new chapter of gaming in Washington State.”</p>
<p>The online sportsbook is powered by IGT, and GeoComply’s PinPoint technology, which is already in use at other casinos, allows for expansion of the sportsbook with minimal capital expenditure. The solution also ensures that the tribe adheres to the provisions of its gaming compact with the state.</p>
<p>GeoComply provides cybersecurity and fraud prevention solutions. This has enabled it to build a large client list, including MGM and FanDuel, as well as Akamai and DraftKings. Its PinPoint solution is already found at other casinos around the US.</p>
<p>GeoComply was recently included in the RegTech 100 for 2022. The RegTech 100 honors innovative technology solution providers in the fields of compliance, risk management and information security that see outstanding revenue growth. An industry expert panel and analysts voted from nearly 1,200 companies that RegTech Analyst, a specialist research company, had provided. From 2017 to 2020, GeoComply saw a revenue increase of 653%, according to a company announcement.</p>
<p>The company also won the Deloitte Technology Fast50 program award this year. Winners of the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 are public and private companies in the technology sector who have had a significant impact on their industry. The program, now in its 24th year, is a part of the Deloitte North American Technology Fast 500, and winners are automatically eligible to be included in the ranking.</p>
