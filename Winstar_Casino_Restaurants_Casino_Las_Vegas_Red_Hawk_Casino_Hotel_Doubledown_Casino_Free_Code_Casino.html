<p>Venter has her A sample test positive for metabolites of stimulant Sibutramine and will be suspended until the matter is dealt with</p>
<p>Mariska Venter, a 26-year-old wheelchair tennis player from South Africa, has voluntarily accepted a provisional suspension for violating the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA)’s anti-doping program.</p>
<p>Provisional Suspension</p>
<p>Venter, who is currently ranked 36 by the ITF, accepted a provisional suspension effective December 13, 2022, and will be ineligible to participate in or attend any tennis event under the governing bodies of the sports until the matter is resolved.</p>
<p>Venter was notified by the ITIA in December that she has been charged with a violation of the 2022 Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP), under Article 2.1 dealing with the presence of a prohibited substance in a player’s sample, and Article 2.2 concerning the use of a prohibited substance without a valid therapeutic use exemption.</p>
<p>The violation occurred at a wheelchair event in Belgium in July during which Venter was selected for a test as the analysis of the test’s A sample uncovered metabolites of Sibutramine, a substance that is classified as a stimulant and is prohibited under section S6 of the 2022 list of prohibited substances.</p>
<p>The List Is Growing</p>
<p>Venter is the latest tennis player to receive a sanction, albeit temporary, from the ITIA as the sports integrity body is determined to clear the sport from manipulation and unfair competition.</p>
<p>Just days ago, the sports integrity body sanctioned two professional tennis players from Algeria for multiple match-fixing offenses and one of them was slapped with a lifetime ban.</p>
<p>In December, ITIA banned for nine months Chinese player Baoluo Zheng for a match-fixing attempt during a tournament in Egypt in October and slapped Chilean tennis player Bárbara Gatica Avilés with a three-year ban for losing a match in exchange for payment in 2016.</p>
<p>Also in December, the integrity body issued lifetime bans to two French tennis players, Jules Okala and Mick Lescure, over match-fixing offenses going back to 2014 as both were found guilty of purposefully losing matches or influencing the outcome of games.</p>
<p>Bulgarian umpire Stefan Milanov, who was found in breach of ITIA’s Tennis Anti-Corruption Programme (TARP) by placing wagers on tennis games on multiple occasions one of which he was officiating, received only a six-month suspension.</p>
<p>Operating as the delegated party under the World Anti-Doping Code of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), ITIA is responsible for the management and administration of anti-doping policies and procedures in professional tennis, in accordance with the 2022 TADP, and is determined to protect the integrity of the sport.</p>
