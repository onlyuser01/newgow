<p>10000 Wishes review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around Middle Eastern folklore.</p>
<p>Players will arrive in a desert with golden sand dunes and a reel stacked with treasures. From ancient texts to precious jewels, the symbols are worth vying for. A genie might be hiding in the shimmering bottles and players could get their wishes granted.</p>
<p>Players will enjoy the magical atmosphere and exotic setting of this Arabian Nights inspired game.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a mysterious Middle Eastern tune filled with low flutes. Players will feel like they are heroes at the climax of an adventure story.</p>
<p>The reels are gleaming with a mix of treasures and classic card suits. Every artifact is ornately decorated with jewels and gold. Perhaps most intriguing are the bottles of blue liquid that might contain either potions or genies.</p>
<p>The animation style is definitely meant to conjure a fantasy of the ancient Middle Eastern world rather than a historical one, but the Aladdin-like world is more fun that way.</p>
<p>The backdrop is a breathtaking desert landscape at sunset with gold sand and purple sky contrasting. Players will feel the dry heat as they look over the endless dunes. It’s easy to imagine discovering long forgotten treasure hidden in the arid setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphics and soundtrack combine to immerse the player in an exotic and magical world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>10000 Wishes is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay is swift and engaging, so players won’t have any trouble getting lost in the world.</p>
<p>Players may opt to activate the Power Mode which increases their chance of triggering the Wheel Bonus (see more details below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Wheel Bonus is triggered whenever players land 3 or more Scatters. This means the centre of the reels transforms into a spinning wheel, while the first and last rows turn into a random stack of high symbols. While in the feature, the player may win three levels of prizes.</p>
<p>There is a guaranteed prize during the Wheel Bonus feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.27%, slightly above our average yardstick of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less optimal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility Arabian Nights-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the volatility is middling, the higher RTP and beautiful theme make this game a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Strategy-minded players may wish to move on from this particular game, but others may simply enjoy the enchanting world and pleasant RTP.</p>
