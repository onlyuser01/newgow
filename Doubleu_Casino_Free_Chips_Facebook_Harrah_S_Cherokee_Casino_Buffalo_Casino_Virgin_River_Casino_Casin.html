<p>Ahead of the legislators' summer break, hopes about changes to regulations about smoking in casinos and ads about sports betting and casinos in New Jersey remain high</p>
<p>In November this year, the law regulating online gambling in New Jersey is set to expire. While lawmakers are trying to extend the activity via a new proposal with a 10-year term, changes to the sector can be implemented as well. Earlier this week, Sen. Joe Cryan introduced a new proposal, calling for changes within the advertisements by casinos and sports betting companies in the state.</p>
<p>The proposal, known as Bill S4021 explicitly calls for the prohibition of advertisements that are fraudulent or deceptive. Under the bill, licensees in New Jersey would be required to ensure that their ads do not feature any deceptive or fraudulent content or terms. Additionally, Bill S4021 doesn’t allow any casino or betting ads to appeal to anyone under the legal age for gambling, something that is standard in all US states.</p>
<p>The latest proposal echoes some bills that are already gaining some traction in New Jersey. Similar to a bill in the Assembly, the latest proposal seeks to restrict deals between sports betting companies and higher education institutions such as colleges and universities. Ultimately, Bill S4021 seeks to protect young adults and people from excessive gambling, while ensuring that ads that promote such activities aren’t deceiving.</p>
<p>In an interview for LegalSportsReport, Sen. Cryan pointed out: “When you watch the ads, which are nonstop, I think most folks would say there’s just too much of that.” Speaking about partnerships between betting operators and universities he said: “It just doesn’t belong in that atmosphere. I think most folks would agree with that.”</p>
<p>Indoor Casino Smoking Ban Still in Limbo</p>
<p>Separately, proposals calling for the prohibition of smoking within casinos in Atlantic City are also gaining traction in the state. Although the current regulation prohibits indoor smoking, casinos are the only exception to the rule, which came into force nearly two decades ago. This effectively allows casino operators to offer indoor smoking, but for years different organizations have shown support to end this practice.</p>
<p>CEASE, or Casino Employees Against Smoking’s Effects, is one such organization that calls to end indoor smoking in casinos. With lawmakers warming up to the idea to ban casino indoor smoking, hopes remain high, but according to Pete Naccarelli, one of the leaders of CEASE and a Borgata dealer, who was interviewed by US Bets, substantial changes to the sector are yet to come.</p>
<p>“We’re officially in the same spot we’ve been for the past couple of years,” he said. Acknowledging that efforts in support of casino indoor smoking ban gain traction he said that out of the 120 legislators within the Assembly and Senate, 85 show support for a proposal that seeks to end indoor casino smoking.</p>
<p>Still, it seems that neither the smoke ban proposal nor the proposal that calls for changes to the rules about gambling ads may get traction, at least before the legislative break planned to start on June 30. Yet, supporters of the measures continue to hope that once the break is over, the proposals will be considered further.</p>
