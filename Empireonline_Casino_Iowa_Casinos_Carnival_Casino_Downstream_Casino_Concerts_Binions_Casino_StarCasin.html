<p>Bettson Group’s StarCasinò Sport announced it has joined forces with Italian Serie B’s governing body to become the Official VAR Partner of the second professional football tier for the second part of the 2022-2023 season.</p>
<p>Growing Appeal of the League</p>
<p>The agreement with Lega Nazionale Professionisti B (LNPB) was signed in collaboration with Infront Italy and made StarCasinò Sport the Official VAR Partner of the BKT Series, the new designation of the Italian second football echelon. It is the latest display of the appeal of the league and its products to the public.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Stefano Tino, managing director of StarCasinò Sport, outlined the importance of the agreement as it has the potential to open new doors for the brand in professional football in the country.</p>
<p>“The LNPB is establishing itself more and more as an appealing competition for fans, players and all investors who choose to believe in this tournament,” Tino added, feeling proud to be able “to support and embark on this new adventure” and anxious “to get started.”</p>
<p>The collaboration with LNPB will see StarCasinò Sport feature via customized TV graphics and the VAR Room facilities. It will also give the brand further visibility across the stadia to help it grow in popularity among TV audiences in the country.</p>
<p>Alessandro Giacomini, managing director of Infront Italy, also commented on the agreement, expressing his “great satisfaction to have StarCasinò Sport alongside Lega Serie B as Official Partner of the VAR.”</p>
<p>“We at Infront have recently activated our collaboration with LNPB, and we are working to be able to bring value to the league which is immediately recognized by the market, with a view to building an ever stronger league with serious and reliable partnerships,” Giacomini added.</p>
<p>The agreement signaled StarCasinò Sport’s continuous commitment to supporting Italian football and promoting the values of sportsmanship and inclusion embedded in the brand’s motto, “The new way of experiencing Sport.”</p>
<p>StarCasinò Sport has already established partnerships with a number of professional football clubs in the country, including AC Milan, AS Roma, FC Turin, US Sassuolo, US Salernitana, and Palermo FC, the club from the capital of Sicily who joined StarCasinò Sport’s roster of partners in October last year.</p>
<p>The brand also launched its tailor-made sportsbook in Italy, StarCasinò Bet, adding sports betting to the online casino gaming brand and helping it grow in the Italian market.</p>
