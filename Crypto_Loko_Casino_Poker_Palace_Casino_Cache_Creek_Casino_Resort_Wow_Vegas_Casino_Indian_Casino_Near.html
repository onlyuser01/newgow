<p>Catena Media has announced a new partnership with Advance Local, the owner of NJ.com, a news and information website, which is now going to double down on casino and betting coverage with help from one of the most prominent companies in the space.</p>
<p>Informing Readers on Sports and Casino Trends</p>
<p>Catena and Advance Local have agreed to a multi-year partnership that will include a deeper look at the current iGaming and sports betting markets in the United States and New Jersey. NJ.com and Advance Local’s properties will become a springboard for Catena’s insight-driven writing and high-quality digital content.</p>
<p>NJ.com readers will have the opportunity to read highly informative articles in both the sports betting and online casino verticals. All content will be created in-house by Catena Media’s experienced team of writers.</p>
<p>A big focus of this content will remain dedicated to promoting a safe betting culture across North America. Catena Media’s North American VP of content operations, Dustin Gouker, welcomed the opportunity and said that it served an important purpose for the company.</p>
<p>Through this forward-looking partnership, the company’s sports betting experts will have the opportunity to engage with a much broader audience in the New Jersey market as well as internationally. He added:</p>
<p>Our goal is to help readers become more informed about sports betting and online casino products and to help promote a safer and more productive gaming culture. Catena Media’s North American VP of content operations, Dustin Gouker</p>
<p>Catena already has a strong team of sports and casino content writers who will be readily available to help NJ.com’s own dedicated content in the two verticals. The resulting revenue will be divvied up between Advance Local and Catena.</p>
<p>Bringing Top-Notch Content to Engage with Readers</p>
<p>Catena is currently expecting this partnership to translate into stronger earnings during the third quarter. The partnership was naturally welcomed by Advance Local VP of sports betting &amp; gaming Howard Kamen who said:</p>
<p>Sports betting and online casino gaming are rapidly evolving in New Jersey and beyond, and this partnership with Catena Media is a fantastic way for us to engage our readers with top-notch content and help them to better understand the landscape. Advance Local VP of sports betting &amp; gaming Howard Kamen</p>
<p>Catena Media is definitely not the only company with a strong presence in the North American market to actively explore such partnerships between media outlets and more traditional affiliate companies.</p>
<p>The popularity of sports betting and the legal status it enjoys have made it possible to leverage the product as well. Just yesterday, Better Collective announced a similar arrangement with The Chicago Tribune, marking the latest tie-up between a mainstream media and sports betting specialist.</p>
