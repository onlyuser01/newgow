<p>The innovative award-winning mobile-first gaming group that offers engaging and fun sportsbook and casino products, Casumo, announced a senior-level appointment. Last week, the company revealed it hired the services of iGaming industry expert Francesco Postiglione. Joining Casumo, he was named the company's new CEO.</p>
<p>Overall, Postiglione brings more than a decade of experience within the gambling vertical. He has extensive knowledge in managing medium to large scale businesses and a track record in driving growth through sales and profits.</p>
<p>Postiglione is experienced not only within the retail but the online gaming space as well and has proven that he can successfully implement omnichannel strategies that help companies grow on an international basis. In his new role, Postiglione is expected to leverage his industry experience and spearhead Casumo's growth.</p>
<p>In a statement released via LinkedIn, Casumo's co-founder, Oscar Simonsson, shared his excitement about the latest announcement. He pointed out: "Francesco is the ideal candidate to take the helm at Casumo and we are confident that he will bring his wealth of experience and passion for innovation to the role." In conclusion, the co-founder noted: "We are thrilled to welcome him to the Casumo Group and are certain that his expertise and leadership will take our company to new heights."</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, Postiglione was also excited to join the company as its new CEO. He said: "I am thrilled to join Casumo, a company that I have long admired for its innovative and customer-centric approach to online gaming." The new CEO added that he will collaborate with the company's team members and help it continue to grow. Last but not least, Postiglione said that delivering unique gaming experiences for Casumo's players will be one of his prime objectives.</p>
<p>Recently, Casumo confirmed it expanded its reach by entering a new market. Late last year, the company said that it entered Ontario, Canada, a market identified for its high potential.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, the company's VP of Commercial, Garry McGibbon, said that Casumo is excited to launch its services for customers in Ontario. Moreover, he acknowledged that the entry further expanded the reach of the company.</p>
<p>Since its foundation a decade ago, back in 2012, Casumo has been continuously growing and expanding within the iGaming vertical. The company's portfolio of brands now includes Casumo, Kazoom Casino, Casino Secret, as well as Dunder. As a supporter of responsible gambling entertainment, Casumo focuses on offering fun and safe casino and sports betting products to its growing audience.</p>
