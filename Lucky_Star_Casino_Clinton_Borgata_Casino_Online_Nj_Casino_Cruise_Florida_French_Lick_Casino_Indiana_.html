    <h1>Lucky Star Casino Clinton Borgata Casino Online Nj Casino Cruise Florida French Lick Casino Indiana</h1>

<p>Dear tiituli901,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"Time-Out, Self-Exclusion and Financial Protection of Players</p>
<p>We are aware that whilst for the majority of customers gaming is simply an entertaining pastime, for a small number of people it can become a problem. For any players wishing to limit their gaming, Onestepcasino offers the Time-out and Self-Exclusion options.</p>
<p>The customer needs to access his/her personal Onestepcasino Account and access the Responsible Gaming tab where he/she can find the available periods οr follow the link. After the customer makes his/her selection, then he/she needs to click on 'Save' to submit the request. The request will be accepted immediately and the customer will receive a confirmation popup. Revoking a Time-Out or definite Self-Exclusion period can only occur after 24 hours from the initial request. Revoking an indefinite Self- Exclusion, can only occur after 7 days from the initial request and at Company’s sole discretion. ‘Time-Out' and 'Self Exclusion' is a formal process, where the customers, at their discretion, request to be barred for a definite period. 'Time-Out' and 'Self-Exclusion' shall become effective immediately. During this time, we cannot accept deposits or bets. Any ongoing bets will remain active and any winnings will be paid to the customer after the event is over.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you require any further information or assistance on Time-Out or Self-Exclusion options.</p>
<p>Any accounts pertaining to customers who have excluded themselves for a definite period will automatically be reopened.</p>
<p>When setting up your account, or on any other time, you may also choose to impose limits as these can be found within the relevant "My Account" section. Once you exceed the maximum self-imposed limits at any time, then you will be restricted for any further actions related to this limit.</p>
<p>Upon setting a limit or exclusion in the manner contemplated above, you can only request a revoke by written notice or electronic notice sent to Onestepcasino. Onestepcasino will take such requests under consideration;however, it will be on Onestepcasino's absolute discretion to deny such request. There are specific software products available to assist the customer with the auto-exclusion process, supplied by organisations such as ICRA. To receive guidance and support about potential gambling issues, please visit: GamCare at www.gamcare.org.uk or call their confidential helpline on 0808 8020 133 or Gambling Therapy at www.gamblingtherapy.org.</p>
<p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Self-Exclusion procedure is adhered to and we shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that no promotional material is sent to customers who have excluded themselves from playing. However, the customer accepts that we are in no way responsible towards the customer or any third party if he/she continues to play with any added accounts, in which he/she has changed any registration details (including cases in which the customer opens an account with the same details but inserted differently in the registration form) or if publicity material is inadvertently forwarded to him. We also strongly recommend that the Client seeks urgent professional assistance if he/she finds a way to continue playing during the Self-Exclusion period. "</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s not written that all your accounts in other casinos of the same owner will be blocked or self-excluded automatically. Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have requested a self-exclusion from Onestep Casino directly?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
