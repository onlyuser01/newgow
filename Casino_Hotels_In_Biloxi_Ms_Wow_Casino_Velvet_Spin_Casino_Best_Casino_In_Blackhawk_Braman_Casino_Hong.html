<p>Hong Kong Extends Mandatory 14-Day Quarantine to July 7, A Setback to Macau Casinos</p>

<p>Hong Kong has extended to July 7 its requirement that anyone arriving from Macau enter a 14-day quarantine. The decision will further delay the casino hub’s urgent mission to restart its economy, which greatly relies on tourism and gambling.</p>

<p>Hong Kong’s announcement yesterday extending the quarantine mandate comes after officials there said the Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) identified four new clusters of COVID-19, which has prompted “super spreader” fears. Anyone entering Hong Kong from Macau, Taiwan, or mainland China – the only three areas Hong Kong is permitting entry – must undergo quarantine.</p>
<p>“It is expected that there may be sporadic infection cases or even small outbreaks in the community,” said Secretary for Food and Health Professor Sophia Chan Siu-chee.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has 1,094 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and four deaths. Macau has just 45, and no deaths – and no new cases in more than 55 days.</p>
<p>Upon entry into Hong Kong, health officials assess each arrival with a risk-based approach to decide who must stay at a government-facilitated quarantine center. Those permitted to self-quarantine at home are monitored by an electronic wristband.</p>
<p>Tourism Setback</p>
<p>In a world free of a pandemic, Hong Kong is a major thoroughfare for Macau, as it’s a global business hub and has the 13th-busiest airport in the world. Travel between the two SARs, however, has come to a halt.</p>
<p>Macau is also limiting inbound arrivals from Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan. Visitor arrivals totaled just 11,041 last month, a 99.7 percent plunge from April 2019.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s decision to extend its quarantine rule is another blow to the recovery of Macau’s casinos.</p>
<p>“This is a disappointment for those waiting for a ‘Greater Bay Area travel bubble’ to kick in this month, including us,” said JP Morgan Securities Asia Pacific analysts DS Kim, Derek Choi, and Jeremy An.</p>
<p>Officials in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau have been mulling a travel covenant that would allow residents in the three areas to move freely without quarantines. But that is being postponed until at least early July.</p>
<p>The JP Morgan analysts said there is a “very small chance” that Macau and Guangdong would proceed with a cross-border arrangement in the interim. “It’s probably reasonable to think a travel bubble will not happen until July 7, as the Chinese government might prefer not to treat two SARs differently,” the note added.</p>
<p>Casinos Remain Open</p>
<p>Macau has requested that the six licensed casino operators retain their work forces and remain open. They have, albeit in much reduced capacities.</p>
<p>Gross gaming revenue dropped 93 percent last month, with win totaling $221 million. In May of 2019, the casinos reported GGR of $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>May marked the enclave’s eighth straight monthly gaming revenue decline. The coronavirus follows China’s suppression of VIP junket groups in 2014-15, the ongoing trade war between the US and People’s Republic, and political outrage in Hong Kong that began last year over a proposed mainland extradition bill that remains unsettled.</p>
