    <h1>The Linq Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Road Bovada Casino Review Doubleu Casino Facebook Miami Casi</h1>

<p>A renewal of the sponsorship deal will continue the cooperation between online betting operator Betfred and the Super League, one of the most significant rugby leagues in Europe. Betfred will secure the presence of its logo as part of the league’s branding, just like it did for the past seven years until the end of the 2023 season.</p>
<p>The deal also marks the relationship between Betfred and the Super League as one of the longest ongoing title sponsorships in the history of the elite European rugby league. What is more, the new deal will continue the ongoing ‘Gamble Responsible’ campaign.</p>
<p>Through Thick and Thin</p>
<p>Super League CCO Rhodri Jones commented on the hardships the league and the sport has faced and how Betfred’s addition would be a step forward for the organization:</p>
<p>“During this difficult period, they’ve been outstanding headline partners, and we can’t thank Fred and his team enough for their continued support. We look forward to continuing to work with them for the next two years. Super League CCO Rhodri Jones</p>
<p>Jones added that having Betfred’s support on the league side would allow the organization to deliver on future goals. The last two seasons have been particularly challenging for the Super League, as the Covid pandemic forced several games to be postponed, canceled, or rescheduled at the last moment due to positive players and coaches.</p>
<p>French authorities placed an attendance limit of 5,000 people on the Catalan Dragons at the end of 2020. Despite all the hardships, in April, UK TV Sports Broadcaster Sky also renewed its rights deal until 2023.</p>
<p>Betfred with Firm Commitment</p>
<p>The deal comes naturally for Betfred as it adds a third rugby-related sponsorship agreement so far in 2021.</p>
<p>Betfred boss Fred Done explained that the massive grassroots and official support behind rugby has made it a worthwhile partnership for the company. Done said:</p>
<p>“The passion and enthusiasm showed by the fans, media, and everybody involved in the game of rugby league is, I believe, the essential reason this has proved such an enjoyable and rewarding sponsorship for Betfred and is why I had absolutely no hesitation in extending the Super League deal for at least a further two years.” Betfred owner Fred Done</p>
<p>Betfred previously secured the rights to men’s and women’s, as well as wheelchair 2021 Challenge Cups in February. In August, Betfred signed an extension to its contract with the Rugby Football League (RFL) until the end of the 2023 season.</p>
