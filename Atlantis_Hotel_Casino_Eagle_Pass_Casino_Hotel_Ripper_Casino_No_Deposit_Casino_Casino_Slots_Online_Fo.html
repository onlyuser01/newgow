<p>The fresh deal inked with the gaming operator that has been handling games, operations, and iGaming platforms in North America and Europe for the last seven years is just another proof of FortuneCoins.com’s determination.</p>
<p>“Mutually Beneficial” Partnership</p>
<p>Together with Mascot Gaming, Fortune Coins will provide free access to casino games to its database of over one million users brought together in less than a year, when it launched.</p>
<p>Mascot Gaming’s head of sales Nikolay Lobov thanked FortuneCoins.com for putting their trust in them. Loboc also expressed excitement for the new agreement and confidence in the partnership’s ability to be “mutually beneficial and create great opportunities for both parties.” The head of sales also spoke about the excellent synergy of their mixed resources and expertise expected to help them reach “results in a quick time”.</p>
<p>Fortune Coins’ head of marketing and partnerships, Yuliya Ivanisova, called Mascot Gaming “a great brand” to add to their platform thanks to their exciting titles. Ivanisova also spoke about Mascot Gaming’s potential to help them bolster their core offerings while additionally further strengthening their footprint in the social casino market.”</p>
<p>Fortune Coins explained that it was looking forward to becoming the leading social casino in North America. The social casino features sweepstakes elements and it is dedicated to offering top-quality, free casino-based forms of entertainment to US players.</p>
<p>The platform’s casino sweepstakes model allows registered members to enjoy the chance to win free coins they can then use to play all available games in the lobby. The list includes a variety of slot games similar to the ones found in online casinos, along with card games and fish games.</p>
<p>Mascot Gaming’s Focus on Service, Aligned with Fortune Coins’ Priorities</p>
<p>As an active promoter of one-of-a-kind graphic effects, top-tier designs, and seamless gaming algorithms that create a unique platform, Mascot Gaming perfectly aligns with the priorities expressed by Fortune Coins. Mascot Gaming is also focused on signing new and advantageous partnerships while taking its place in the market, which has helped it create a harmonious relationship with Fortune Coins.</p>
<p>Last May, Mascot Gaming joined Pariplay’s Fusion offering as a result of an agreement meant to help the distribution platform grow with fresh content. NeoGames’ subsidiary also recently added Mancala Gaming to its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Greedy Greenskins Rockways, La Fiesta de Muertos, and The Candy Keno are some of Mascot’s non-trivial, appealing, and entertaining slots that are “exciting for players and profitable for operators.”</p>
