<p>Pearl of the Orient review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Pearl of the Orient is a somewhat misleadingly titled game from iSoftBet. Not only has the term "The Orient" fallen somewhat out of favour as a term meaning South East Asia, but there are also very few pearls to speak of.</p>
<p>What you get is a fairly kitsch rendering of generic Chinese artefacts: paper lanterns, coins with a square hole in the middle, and of course gold and red everywhere. The pearls make their appearance in the expanding Wilds where a woman is shown holding a pearl roughly the size of a beach ball.</p>
<p>Big win in the Pearl of the Orient slot machine</p>
<p>It is a theme deeply riddled with cliché.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The clichés are rendered prettily enough, with nice artwork that is large and clear. The animations are simple but effective and the sound design solidwith a gentle track that mimics Chinese traditional music in a way that sets the scene without stealing it.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Gameplay is pretty basic in Pearl of the Orient. The base game is a five by three slot with no gamble function or extra features.</p>
<p>The bonuses (described in full below) are also rather lacklustre and amount to nothing more than a Wild symbol and a Free Spin bonus.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter symbol. The Wild expands to fill its entire row and only appears on rows 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol, as well as paying out for three or more symbols anywhere on the reels, triggers 12 free spins.</p>
<p>Boost of the winnings with 2 expanding Wild symbols</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.97%, very close to the industry yardstick we use of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was $/£/€0.10 to $/£/€100.00 covering bet sizes that will meet the needs of almost all comers.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium to high, which falls within the range we can recommend matching up with our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Paytable for Pearl of the Orient slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pearl of the Orient is a rather bland slot machine using overused imagery and colour schemes to create a world which a dozen other slots have done better before.</p>
<p>The RTP is not terrible, but certainly doesn’t excite us. Nor does the medium to high volatility. It’s not bad, but it's also not great.</p>
<p>Overall this slot is one you should probably pass on. If you want something within the Chinese style, maybe give something like Five Lucky Lions a go instead.</p>
