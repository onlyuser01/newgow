<p>The new program seeks to prevent gambling addiction and provide invaluable insights that will help with the treatment of gambling harm and problem gambling</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in the Netherlands, the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), asked the Dutch organization for health research and care innovation, ZonMw, to launch research into problem gambling and the treatment of gambling harm and addiction. Consequently, ZonMw confirmed the launch of a new Prevention of Gambling Addiction research program last week.</p>
<p>The new program launched on March 1 with a call for funding for researchers within the field of gambling harm, as well as gambling addiction treatment. Experts in the aforementioned fields will have until May 5 to register for funding of their research. It is not uncommon for such processes to require specific conditions which the researchers need to meet. This is why ZonMw confirmed that the conditions needed for funding under the program can be found on its website.</p>
<p>“The Gaming Authority has asked ZonMw to develop a research program on the prevention and treatment of gambling addiction,“ reads a statement released by the KSA</p>
<p>Treatment and Prevention Programs Are Developed under KOA</p>
<p>It was back in 2021 when the Netherlands enforced the Remote Gambling Act, also known as KOA. The new framework effectively strengthened the regulation of online gambling in the country and at the same time enforced requirements for responsible gambling and the prevention of gambling addiction. This is applicable for both land-based and online games of chance in the country.</p>
<p>Under KOA, an Addiction Prevention Fund was established. The gambling regulator manages that fund in the country and the latest research program fills in one of those objectives, which is funding research for programs that help with the treatment of gambling addiction and the prevention of gambling harm as well.</p>
<p>The first research within that area was led by the Trimbos Institute. The experts that participated in the study helped develop a list of “priority” topics that need to be addressed when it comes to the treatment and prevention of problem gambling.</p>
<p>The announcement about the new treatment and gambling harm prevention program comes after last month, the KSA enforced hefty fines against two operators. At the time of the announcement, the regulator said that it found two companies that operated illegally which resulted in a $1.9 million fine.</p>
