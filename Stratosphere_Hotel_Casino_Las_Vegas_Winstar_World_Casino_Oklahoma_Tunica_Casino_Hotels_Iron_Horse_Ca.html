<p>BetMGM New Jersey will expand its offering in the state with a selection of iGaming titles from Aruze Gaming</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming, a globally-operating company that produces slot machines and gaming devices for the casino gaming industry, has unveiled a new agreement with the leading operator BetMGM. The new agreement will see the supplier power the gambling giant with some of its best games.</p>
<p>Aruze Gaming Will Add Four Titles to BetMGM’s Platform</p>
<p>As per the deal, Aruze Gaming will provide BetMGM with a small selection of some of its best gaming titles. Those will include four hits, namely Ultra Stack Showgirls, Ultra Stack Lion, 8 Wealthy Lions and Wolf 500g.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, BetMGM will launch these games in New Jersey, engaging local audiences with Aruze’s premium gaming content. The deal will also help the supplier grow its presence in the region and make its name known among local players.</p>
<p>As outlined in the partnership, Aruze will power BetMGM’s New Jersey offering with more of its games in the future. Titles such as Rock Paper Scissors Instant Win are expected to go live on the operator’s platform in the state within the next weeks.</p>
<p>BetMGM, meanwhile, will now also offer Skillzzgaming content to its fans, it was announced. Thanks to Pariplay’s aggregation platform, the operator was able to augment its portfolio with Skillzzgaming fan favorites, including the beloved Fruit Blast.</p>
<p>However, not everything has been great for the operator as it opened the year with a fine from the Ohio Casino Control Commission.</p>
<p>Hansen Shared Aruze’s Excitement about the Deal</p>
<p>Aruze’s vice president of iGaming, Kurt Hansen, spoke about the agreement with BetMGM. He labeled BetMGM as a “trusted and beloved operator,” saying that Aruze’s team is very happy to be able to provide it with games.</p>
<p>Hansen continued, noting that Aruze will be focusing a lot of its efforts on expanding its iGaming footprint in 2023. According to the VP, the developer values the convenience of mobile devices and wants to bring more of its award-winning games to the virtual world. This, Hansen said, would allow players to enjoy them anytime, anyplace.</p>
<p>Aruze, which is already popular among land-based operators, hopes to conquer the digital sector as well. Hansen believes that this will attract many new customers toward the developer’s products, especially players who do not have an accessible casino nearby.</p>
<p>Kansen joined Aruze in July 2022, leveraging his experience to execute and implement the company’s online growth strategy. A month later, the company was also joined by Lesley Hodges who was designated as senior director of marketing.</p>
