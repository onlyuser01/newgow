    <h1>Casino In Southern California Augustine Casino Coachella Ca Casinos Near Cincinnati Ohio Hollywood C</h1>

<p>Gaming Corps has been granted a permit to deliver its full portfolio of games to the Dutch iGaming market, following approval by the Kansspelautoriteit, or the Dutch Gaming Authority. Thanks to this certification, Gaming Corps will be able to bring a variety of individual titles and game genres, such as plinko, crash, table, slot, and mine to the market and help partner operators enrich their standing.</p>
<p>The license approval comes at a time when Gaming Corps has already negotiated alliances with a number of companies that are present in the Dutch gaming market, including Tikiz N Juice, Stormy Witch, Coin Miner, Skyliner, Cat Ching, Jet Lucky2, and Penalty Champion. All these operators will now receive the Swedish developer’s titles and benefit from its unique proposition.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, Gaming Corps CEO Juha Kauppinen welcomed the opportunity to be joining the market and expand the reach of popular titles, as well as leverage local expertise and player preferences to help create new and worthwhile titles. Kauppinen added:</p>
<p>"We see these strategic entries as important to the future of the company while we strive to make the most of our existing titles and those in development."</p>
<p>The executive said that the company’s products have enjoyed a "warm reception" and the supplier feels confident in its future success in the market. The Netherlands has been a tremendous opportunity for suppliers and operators. Despite the market’s tight regulation, all companies from the iGaming sector have acknowledged the country’s potential in terms of online casino and sports betting momentum.</p>
<p>That is why many stakeholders have been entering and expanding in the Netherlands. In November, Pragmatic Play signed a partnership with Livescore Bet for the country’s market and extended its catalog of games to the operator.</p>
<p>Altenar received the go-ahead to launch in the Dutch market a month prior to that, which was hailed as a milestone by the company. NetEnt, one of the staple names of the slot industry, also teamed up to provide slots for Holland Casino’s online operations.</p>
