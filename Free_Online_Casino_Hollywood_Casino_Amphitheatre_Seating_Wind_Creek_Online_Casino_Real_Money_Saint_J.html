<p>GG.BET, an online esports betting brand has made a foray into the United Kingdom after Rednines Gaming secured approval to use the trademark in the country. As a result, British players will be able to place exciting wagers on their favorite esports disciplines.</p>
<p>Rednines Gaming used to operate in the UK under the brand Dr.Bet which offered iGaming products and sports bets. However, Dr.Bet’s website will now automatically redirect users to a new UK-oriented GG.BET domain, GG.BET.co.uk.</p>
<p>The company reassured customers that their current accounts and active balances will be saved. Old Dr.Bet customers will thus be able to use their credentials to log in and play with the rebranded operator.</p>
<p>With GG.BET now available in the UK, local players will get to experience intense sports ad esports betting experiences. The site will offer a huge selection of wagering markets, appealing to many sports and esports fans.</p>
<p>In addition to that, GG.BET will also offer casino slots, as well as a generous bonus program for new and existing users. Finally, the company will offer reliable customer support, helping its clients find resolutions to all their queries.</p>
<p>GG.BET Seeks International Expansion</p>
<p>GG.BET UK’s chief executive officer, Sergii Mishchenko, spoke on the matter, saying that the decision to purchase the GG.BET franchise was an important step.</p>
<p>Mishchenko said that his team decided to operate under a well-known brand so it could stand out from other bookmakers in the highly competitive UK market. He concluded that his team is glad to become a part of something bigger.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to become a part of a global brand, and are looking forward to contributing to the esports betting market in the UK. Sergii Mishchenko, CEO, GG.BET UK</p>
<p>The move will reinforce the GG.BET brand which continues to target international expansion. As one of Europe’s most lucrative and rapidly-growing betting markets, the United Kingdom continues to attract many companies such as GG.BET.</p>
<p>In other news, GG.BET recently held its Match of LeGGends, featuring Team Vitality and NAVI, two of the best esports teams in the world. The operator launched a variety of special promotions during the event, engaging fans while allowing them to show their love for their favorite players.</p>
<p>GG.BET is also the partner of many leagues, teams and players. In May, the company teamed up with Gaules for the Blast Major in Paris.</p>
