    <h1>Posh Casino Casinos Online Real Money Charlestown Casino Casino Resorts In Florida Casino Free Spins</h1>

<p>Play’n GO, the popular supplier of premium slots that offers its portfolio to operators in more than 25 jurisdictions, has announced the addition of a new title to its iconic “100” series. Sweet Alchemy 100 is the name of the freshest release that has joined the roster of games aimed at “thrill-seekers and grid slot lovers.”</p>
<p>What sets the innovative “100” series apart is the fact that it gives players the opportunity to unlock exciting x100 Multipliers and up to x100 Free Spins. The new game also joins the Sweet Alchemy series of slots popping with candy-colored symbols drizzled with tasty prizes which also includes the June sequel release, Sweet Alchemy 2.</p>

<p>Follow Cherry, Berry, and Apple to Summon the Witch Powers</p>
<p>The company’s head of game retention, George Olekszy, commented on the new release, praising the success of the Sweet Alchemy series and further explaining their decision to commission the two sequels. Olekszy said the new game captures “everything that made the original title so much fun” while also representing a top-tier fresh entry in the “100” Series. By adding three brand new characters, the slot also does a good job of building on the provider’s intellectual property.</p>
<p>During non-winning spins, the three new characters, Cherry, Beery, and Apple, will be seen releasing various effects and conjuring rewards. Witch Powers also become active on non-winning spins and their purpose is to boost player potential.</p>
<p>Cherry is the Red Witch whose power is to randomly select low-paying symbols and change them into the same ones. Berry is the Blue Witch who can add up to two random symbols on the reels, triggering the Free Spins feature. Apple the Green Witch has the power to remove two different types of low-paying symbols from the grid. When there are no symbols to remove, players are allowed to select a Wild symbol or a high-paying symbol.</p>
<p>Trinity Feature, Win Multiplier, and Free Spins</p>
<p>The game also offers a Trinity feature activated when the Trinity meter is filled with high-paying wins. Players get One Free round whenever Cherry, Berry, and Apple’s Witch Powers are conjured successively.</p>
<p>The game resets the Win Multiplier capped at up to x100 prior to the free round, provided the Free Spins are not triggered.</p>
<p>To activate the Free Spins round, players need to clean the grid while engaged in the Trinity feature. During the Free Spins round, players are asked to choose one of the three witches to find out how many Free Spins and non-winning effects will be triggered. During the same round, all non-winning Witch Powers will play on all non-winning spins.</p>
<p>When the Trinity feature is not active, the Clear Grid Prize attracts a 50x Win Multiplier on top of players’ current bets.</p>
<p>In mid-July, the studio announced the addition of a fresh title, Merlin: Journey of Flame, to the equally popular Merlin series after launching its most successful game, Book of Dead, with William Hill for the UK.</p>
