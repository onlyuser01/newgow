<p>Leading US daily fantasy and sports betting brand DraftKings announced a new initiative in the responsible gaming space after an agreement to provide the International Center for Responsible Gaming (ICRG) with financial support.</p>
<p>Science-Backed Responsible Gaming Research</p>
<p>DraftKings’ commitment to ICRG’s Fund to Support Research on Sports Wagering will allow the fund to approach researchers around the world and invite those interested in research on problem gambling to submit applications.</p>
<p>“The cornerstone of our commitment to customers is providing an enjoyable sports betting and gaming experience, and we recognize that we have a responsibility to ensure that customers are playing safely.” Jason Robins, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, DratfKings</p>
<p>The focus of the ground-breaking initiative supported by the fund will be to produce peer-reviewed scientifically-backed responsible gaming research in sports betting that will make a meaningful contribution to the understanding and application of the concept of responsible gaming within the broader industry context.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to support the critical mission of the International Center for Responsible Gaming and fund important research that will drive responsible gaming innovation and customer safety forward for the entire industry.” Jason Robins, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, DratfKings</p>
<p>The first-of-its-kind fund, which was created by the ICRG to support sports betting responsible gaming innovation and best practices implementation, is accepting grant applications related to differences in sports betting compared to other gaming verticals, evaluation for existing intervention programs in the industry, and problem gambling patterns across demographics.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly honored to have DraftKings’ financial support, which was instrumental in satisfying our funding needs for the Fund to Support Research on Sports Wagering.” Dr. Russell Sanna, Executive Director, ICRG</p>
<p>Grant Winner Selected in September</p>
<p>The fund is expected to attract top-tier academic researchers, looking to discover new insights related to the impact of sports betting on public health. The application process is set to begin this summer and conclude by the end of September 2021, when a peer review will precede the ICRG independent Scientific Advisory Board final selection to determine the recipient of the funding.</p>
<p>“With the expansion of sports betting across the United States, public health research will be critical in better understanding problem gaming, and we are deeply appreciative of the support from DraftKings to fund research that is cutting-edge and can be utilized across the industry and by consumers.” Dr. Russell Sanna, Executive Director, ICRG</p>
<p>Open to any public, private or nonprofit US-based or international organizations, the fund will provide support for a three-year project set to complete by 2024, but research findings may be published earlier.</p>
<p>The latest initiative to support evidence-based research confirmed DraftKings’ commitment to responsible gaming, dedicating technology, training and resources to mitigate gambling harm and protect people from vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Customers at the Boston-based brand have at their disposal a range of responsible gaming tools such as limit setting, cooling-off periods and self-exclusion. In addition, the Platinum Member of the National Council on Problem Gambling and member of the American Gaming Association regularly sends its customers responsible gaming behavior reminders via email and social media channels.</p>
