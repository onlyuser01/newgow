<p>Hacksaw Gaming continues to go from strength to strength in Italy, CCO Star said in a statement about the new deal.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a leading developer of iGaming content, has agreed to provide the Italian operator Sisal with a selection of games. As agreed, the provider will integrate some of its best titles into Sisal’s platform, including all-time favorite hits such as Cubes.</p>
<p>Cubes, one of Hacksaw Gaming’s signature titles, will be the first game to become available to Sisal customers. It is famous for being Hacksaw’s first 3D-styled release. Its popularity earned it a sequel called Cubes 2, which was released in 2021.</p>
<p>Under the agreement between the two companies, more Hacksaw games will go live on Sisal’s platform over the next few weeks. This includes fan-favorite slots such as Hand of Anubis, Hop’n’Pop and Aztec Twist. In addition, players will also be able to enjoy some of Hacksaw’s instant win games, such as Mines and Coins.</p>
<p>Sisal is a company owned by Flutter Entertainment that has cemented its position as one of the leading operators in Italy. What differentiates the gambling firm from its competitors is its rich portfolio of slots, poker, lotteries and sports betting.</p>
<p>Sisal is perhaps best known for its wide range of lotteries as it offers some of the best lottery titles in Italy. These include games such as SiVinceTutto, Vinci per la vita – Win for Life, Eurojackpot, VinciCasa and the exclusive SuperEnalotto.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Is Happy to Partner with a “Household Name”</p>
<p>Gabrielle Star, Hacksaw Gaming’s chief commercial officer, commented on the agreement. She noted that her company has been steadily expanding its presence in Italy since its foray into the market earlier this year.</p>
<p>According to Star, the deal represents a “signal of Hacksaw’s intentions” as it furthers its presence in regulated jurisdictions. She believes that the current deal will benefit Hacksaw a Lot, considering Sisal’s local popularity.</p>
<p>Sisal is a household name in Italy, and we’re delighted its players can finally get a taste of our award-winning games. Gabrielle Star, CCO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming is a Malta-based company that was founded in 2018. It has quickly grown into a leading supplier of top iGaming titles and now serves over 20 regulated markets.
