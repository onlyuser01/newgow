<p>The Dallas Cowboys vs. Miami Dolphins is one of the most interesting matchups of Week 16 as each team is sitting in the No. 2 place in its conference</p>
<p>Both Dallas and Miami are 10-4 on the season, and they‚Äôre both doing great at the moment. Sure, the Cowboys lost their most recent game, but that happened against the Bills on the road. Before that, they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles and a few other heavyweights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dolphins have had a relatively easy schedule lately, but we still saw them lose to the Tennessee Titans at home two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Dallas Cowboys Planning to Come Back to the Winning Track</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are coming to Florida after a disappointing loss in Buffalo. The Bills beat them 31-10 last weekend, with Dallas‚Äôs quarterback Dak Prescott making zero touchdown passes. Actually, he went 21-for-34 for 134 yards, suffering one interception along the way.</p>
<p>The game saw the Bills defense make some really tough tackles on him. They didn‚Äôt injure him, but they left the QB frustrated. The bad news is that he can expect the same from Miami‚Äôs defense in Week 16.</p>

<p>The Cowboys‚Äô offense was bad last week, but their defense was even worse. They did okay defending against passing, but their run defense was horrible ‚Äì they conceded three rushing touchdowns in that game.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs something that needs to worry them because Miami is the league‚Äôs No. 1 team when it comes to rushing touchdowns per game with 1.9 on average.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins Want to Show They Can Beat Big Teams</p>
<p>The Dolphins are 10-4 this season, but most of their wins happened against teams with a negative record. In fact, they only have one win over a team that‚Äôs currently over .500 ‚Äì the Denver Broncos (7-7). However, when they beat them 70-20, the Broncos were on a 3-game losing skid.</p>
<p>In the 2023 NFL, the Dolphins have only played against three teams that are currently over .500, and they lost each time. On the bright side for their fans, they did very well against underdogs.</p>
<p>For example, they destroyed the New York Jets 30-0 at home last weekend, with two of their three TDs being rushing TDs.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys vs. Miami Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>Is it time for the Dolphins to finally beat a big opponent? We think it might be. They‚Äôre a good team, with some pretty good players, particularly on the offensive team.</p>
<p>Plus, they‚Äôre playing on their turf, which should give them a massive confidence boost. And given that the spread is set to just 1.5 points, we think they‚Äôre going to cover it.</p>
<p>Picks: Miami Dolphins -1.5 (-110) &amp; Over 51.5</p>
