<p>Virginia welcomes Bally’s Corporation’s omnichannel sports betting platform as the latest entry in the state.</p>
<p>Bally’s Secures Sports Betting Permit in Virginia</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation has become the latest provider of gaming and interactive omnichannel entertainment to break coveted ground in Virginia’s sports betting market. The company has been handed down a temporary sports permit allowing it to run betting products on the territory of Virginia.</p>
<p>This grants Bally’s an opportunity to showcase its state-of-the-art betting solutions and roll out its full platform, growing its footprint and boosting awareness for its products among Virginia’s sports fans.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation has vowed on several occasions that it’s committed to pursuing further growth in the US betting market and expanding in Virginia is a stepping stone towards this end.</p>
<p>Bally’s focus shifted on interactive entertainment in November last year when the company announced that it’s purchasing Bet.Works to give itself a start in the interactive sports betting industry in the state.</p>
<p>With the latest entry in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Bally’s effectively present in 13 jurisdictions across the country, including Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and others.</p>
<p>Building on Success in One of the Largest States</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation chief executive officer George Papanier welcomed the news and said that the company was pleased to be joining Virginia’s sports betting market even in this temporary quality.</p>
<p>“This represents another step in our evolution to become the leading omnichannel gaming provider in the U.S., and we look forward to providing a first-class experience for sports fans across Virginia,” Papanier added.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Virginia is effectively the 21st state that has allowed sports betting. The state has a population of 8.6 million people, making it one of the most significant markets up for grabs.</p>
<p>When the Virginia Lottery began accepting licenses, no fewer than 27 applied for a share and the chance to enter the fledgling betting market. Sports betting companies have been going live in the state since late January.</p>
<p>FanDuel managed to get a jump start owing to its partnership with the Washington Football Team. The company was closely followed by DraftKings in second, and many others joining, including BetMGM.</p>
