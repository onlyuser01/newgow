<p>The German Sports Betting Association (DSWV) has teamed up with the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which brings the two organizations closer together in their joint mission of ensuring the safety of sports betting markets and integrity of sports.</p>
<p>IBIA and DSWV Committed to Pool Efforts</p>
<p>Both organizations reunite a number of stakeholders within their frameworks, making the alliance even more important as these members can now join forces, exchange know-how, and generally swap best practices in making sure that their offers are up on par and that they continue to safeguard sports against predatory practices and third parties.</p>
<p>DSWV and IBIA will collaborate together to address integrity issues and betting offenses. As a result, the two associations will pool resources and activities to first make Germany a safer place for sports bettors through the use of integrity protection measures, and best-in-class practices. DSWV president Mathias Dahms naturally welcomed the announcement and opportunity to strengthen the integrity of the sports betting industry in Germany:</p>
<p>With its many years of international experience and expertise in the field of sports integrity, the IBIA will support us in strengthening the regulated market and protecting it from manipulation. We, therefore, look forward to many joint projects and constructive cooperation. DSWV president Mathias Dahms</p>
<p>IBIA CEO Khalid Ali has similarly welcomed the opportunity to work with DSWV. He recognized the efforts the association has put into making the regulated sports betting market in Germany safer and in line with global integrity standards. Both organizations will face challenges as well as opportunities in the German market, Ali explained but said that both were prepared to raise to the occasion.</p>
<p>“IBIA looks forward to working closely with the DSWV to improve and protect the German sports betting market for consumers, sports and betting operators,” he noted. IBIA has been actively championing a safer betting and sports industry by bringing stakeholders such as sportsbooks and sports leagues, NGOs, and other prominent and relevant parties to its network of partners.</p>
<p>Building a Safer Betting Future for All</p>
<p>IBIA has in fact actively started to seek out esports partners and added GRID as its first esports company member. The association registered 76 suspicious betting alerts in the third quarter, referring to betting behavior aberrations reported by its partners. Not least, IBIA announced recently that it is expanding in North America with Sporttrade</p>
