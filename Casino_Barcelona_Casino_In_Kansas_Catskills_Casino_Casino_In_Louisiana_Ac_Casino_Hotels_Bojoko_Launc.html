    <h1>Casino Barcelona Casino In Kansas Catskills Casino Casino In Louisiana Ac Casino Hotels Bojoko Launc</h1>

<p>The betting affiliate Bojoko has expanded its presence in the United Kingdom by launching a sports betting website.</p>
<p>Bojoko Launches a New Affiliate Site</p>
<p>The British site goes by the name Bojoko Sports Betting and will use a double-layer approach to provide punters with a better understanding of sports wagering before placing a bet. The site’s goal is to help its users make informed decisions and bet cleverly.</p>
<p>Bojoko’s site employs gambling and sports specialists who will provide valuable analysis of the latest sports and betting developments and create customer-oriented content. The site has also prepared a team of independent sportsbook testers who will evaluate the quality of the various sportsbooks available in Britain.</p>
<p>One of Bojoko’s key criteria is an operator’s withdrawal time. The affiliate website will encourage sportsbooks with fast withdrawal times by awarding them with a badge. All operators who believe they qualify can apply for such a badge.</p>
<p>Bojoko has vowed to only promote sites that correspond to its standards and help customers find the perfect sportsbook for themselves. Bettors can make use of the site’s various tools to filter online sports betting operators based on their preferences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bojoko allows customers to write their own reviews, sharing their good and bad experiences with their fellow sports bettors.</p>
<p>Bojoko’s Experience Will Be Key to the Site’s Success</p>
<p>Bojoko isn’t new to the British market and already has experience in the field through its casino offering, which works similarly to Bojoko Sports Betting but for land-based locations. The casino affiliate has been available to British customers for almost five years, and Bojoko hopes that the sports betting site will replicate this success.</p>
<p>Jussi Viljanen, the head of sports for Bojoko, spoke on the launch. He explained that expanding into the sports wagering vertical seemed like a logical next step. Viljanen hopes that the sportsbook affiliate will help users pick the best sports betting brands among all the recommended bookmakers.</p>
<p>“Our innovative double-layer approach helps to highlight the sportsbooks that go above and beyond to deliver a top player experience while at the same time allowing our visitors and members to identify those brands quickly and easily.” Bojoko head of sports Jussi Viljanen</p>
<p>Viljanen concluded by saying that Bojoko Spots Betting will use the tested methods of the brand’s casino affiliate. This is why he is convinced that the new site will quickly become the leading destination for UK sports bettors who wish to find the best sportsbook news.</p>
