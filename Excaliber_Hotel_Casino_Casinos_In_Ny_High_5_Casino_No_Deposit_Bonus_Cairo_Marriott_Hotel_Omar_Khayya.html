    <h1>Excaliber Hotel Casino Casinos In Ny High 5 Casino No Deposit Bonus Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayya</h1>

<p>Betsoft Gaming has become the latest supplier for DBosses, a newly-launched mobile-first casino by iGG. The casino is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) giving it immediate reach in European and international markets, and allowing it to benefit from suppliers such as Betsoft that are bringing an array of trusted and enjoyable experiences, including Gold Tiger Ascent, Triple Juicy Drops and many more.</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming Powers DBosses’ Gaming Offer</p>
<p>Betsoft has been rapidly expanding its footprint and has won numerous distinctions for its unique content of games and products which have become part of the company’s long-term strategy, making it easier to integrate with new brands. Betsoft also comes with a set of proprietary assets that make the integration and gamification of the products it offers much simpler.</p>
<p>The supplier comes with a Take the Prize feature that is designed to boost the experience for Betsoft players at DBosses. Meanwhile, the casino has several promotional tools to boost the experience as well, including the dedicated VIP Club and the opportunity to enjoy personal VIP Managers as a casino feature.</p>
<p>Betsoft Gaming head of account management Anna Mackney had this to say commenting on the opportunity:</p>
<p>“Betsoft is delighted to be one of the first content providers on board with DBosses. 2022 is clearly going to be the year of innovation across the industry and we are looking forward to contributing to the success of this new venture.” Betsoft Gaming head of account management Anna Mackney</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iGaming Group WhiteLabels game aggregation manager John Foster welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with proven content suppliers who are prepared to contribute their full scale of experience to new and upcoming casino brands.</p>
<p>Betsoft offers a great caliber of games, Foster added. In December, Betsoft became a part of Holland Casino’s digital portfolio adding its distinct titles to the casino regulated in the Dutch iGaming market.</p>
