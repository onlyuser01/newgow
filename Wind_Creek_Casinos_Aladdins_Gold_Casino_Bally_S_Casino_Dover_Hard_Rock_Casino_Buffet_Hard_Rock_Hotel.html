    <h1>Wind Creek Casinos Aladdins Gold Casino Bally S Casino Dover Hard Rock Casino Buffet Hard Rock Hotel</h1>

<p>Hello Branislav,</p>
<p>I can understand that it seems I made the mistake. But that's not the case. I'm happy to explain the points.</p>
<p>At the time I started verification, all address data was correct. I then moved at the end of October. The street has remained the same, only the house number has changed (50b instead of 51). I have also proven this.</p>
<p>I don't have a car and didn't know where my driver's license was as I don't drive. I didn't know where my driver's license was. I've also never had to show a driver's license at a casino. But then I found him. My birth name is on my driver's license. I got married and took my wife's name. My passport has the old surname AND the new surname, the first name has stayed the same. In this respect, it is clearly recognizable here that it is my driver's license. In Germany, the driver's license does not have to be changed if you get a new surname, as the new surname and the old surname are written on the ID card.</p>
<p>Again: At the time of verification, the address I provided during registration was on all documents. If I then move and the house number changes, it's not as if I gave wrong data.</p>
<p>All the documents I sent to the casino in the first email contained all the required data. All the data was correct, and several weeks later the house number changed.</p>
<p>The casino did NOT prove that they emailed me in September. The email you and I received was the first email I received from the casino. I didn't get anything before. I only got all the information I had for verification via chat.</p>
<p>You act like I can't prove my data. But I already did this SEVERAL TIMES at the beginning. I sent you the screenshot of the email. Here all data was BEFORE MOVING and all data was correct (name, date of birth, address, payment). This is enough for verification in any casino. But then new and new documents are repeatedly requested. It's not my fault if verification takes MONTHS. I've never experienced anything like that. I have never had any problems getting verified at a casino. When verifying at betsofa, the verification process is apparently lengthened so that you forego your profit. I have never seen a casino ask for documents such as a birth certificate when the name, address and payment are clearly documented at the time.</p>
