    <h1>Slotgard Casino Casinos In Vicksburg Ms Pachanga Casino Avalon Casino The Aquarium At Silverton Casi</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'd like to raise delayed payment issue with Jackbit casino.</p>
<p>Up until this week, my experience with them has been very good and it's such a shame I have to resort to filing a complaint on CasinoGuru when this could be resolved via chat with their customer rep. Unfortunately, I feel that no action has been taken and I'm just being asked to wait by the customer service rep so I'm taking this up with you guys and also to give other future players insight on how Jackbit conduct withdrawals with their players.</p>
<p>As you can see in attached file "1.jpg", I have had previous successful withdrawals, no problem. But when I placed a withdrawal request for 0.0335 BTC on March 6 9:28PM (my time), this got rejected so I went to chat with their customer rep and customer rep said it's because I need to get myself verified, although when I check my profile to see if there are still some info I may have missed to submit, it already says I'm mail verified (see attachment 2.jpg). There are no other requirements posted in that verification page what else I need to submit. Just the email verification which I already verified.</p>
<p>In any case, their customer service rep contacted their relevant department and I got an email from their verification team asking me to upload my ID and I sent my driver's license ID picture (front and back) to their verification team via email. I also asked their customer service rep via chat to confirm if their verification team received the ID I sent them via email and customer service rep replied that they did receive my ID (see 3.jpg).</p>
<p>I got no reply from their verification team what else I needed to submit to get verified. Since no other document was asked from me, I placed another withdrawal on March 6 10:16PM (my time) for 0.067 BTC (valued at $1,600 at the time of withdrawal), which until Mar 9 11PM (my time) is still in process (see 1.jpg). That's more than 72 hours already.</p>
<p>At that point (72 hours after I placed withdrawal request) I went to chat again with their customer service rep explaining I've been waiting for my withdrawal for over 72 hours already but it is still not credited (see 4.jpg).</p>
<p>I explained that I've already sent my driver's license documents 3 days ago and that their customer service rep confirmed that they received it.</p>
<p>I even asked customer rep kindly if they can just call the verification department and ask them what else I need to submit but customer service rep just asks me to wait another 24 hours.</p>
<p>It's now March 11 9AM (my local time) which is more than the 24 additional hours I waited that the customer service rep asked me to wait, and this is more than 100 hours I already waited since I requested withdrawal for 0.067 BTC.</p>
<p>If you were a customer, and you put yourself in my shoes, you've been waiting more than 100 hours for withdrawal and no action how would you feel?</p>
<p>No email communications were ever sent to me for updates on my withdrawal.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Mike</p>
