<p>Kalamba Games and Bragg Gaming Group announced an expansion of their partnership which will enable the former to distribute a number of its player-favorite and high-performing slots through Bragg’s dedicated Remote Game Server. The partnership targets regulated gambling markets in the United States and Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Bragg Determined to Bring More Suppliers in NA</p>
<p>Through this new agreement, both companies seek to increase their clout in the North American market, which is set to explode with more iGaming legislation underway. The focus of the companies will be on key jurisdictions but further expansion moves should follow next. Bragg Gaming Group president of Americas Kent Young welcomed this partnership opportunity:</p>
<p>We’ve enjoyed a successful partnership with Kalamba over the last five years as their iGaming content has proven to be in demand with players. We are pleased to now be able to leverage our data-driven insights into player preferences to strategically introduce Kalamba titles to expand the scope of content we offer across North America. Bragg Gaming Group president of Americas Kent Young</p>
<p>Young said that the company’s own data-driven insights have indicated that Kalamba would be a viable partner and one that will dominate North America as it is. Kalamba Games already has years of observing the developer’s work first-hand.</p>
<p>The pair has been working for a while now, as the companies first teamed up in 2017 and Kalamba launched its first round of games on the global iGaming market. Since 2018, there has been a sustained push in the United States to introduce more iGaming options, which has led to the present-day partnership when even New York is toying with the idea of regulating interactive casinos.</p>
<p>Kalamba is also one of Bragg Gaming’s trusted partners with whom the partnership was extended to cover the US market. Kalamba will be able to offer a number of games that are an important addition to the existing portfolio. Babylon and Griffin’s Quest, Firedrake’s Fortune, and Gates of Babylon are all excellent games that will appeal to US customers. Then, there are Monkey God and Huang Jin Shu who are equally riveting to players.</p>
<p>Kalamba Games Is Determined to Sustain Growth</p>
<p>Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby said that Kalamba Games remains focused on expanding across the United States, and this partnership with Bragg Gaming is a step in this direction. The executive added:</p>
<p>The U.S. iGaming market as a whole has been on our radar for some time, as it offers great potential for both ourselves and the industry as a whole. Thanks to our long-standing and successful partnership with Bragg’s ORYX Gaming, we can now bring our premium entertainment and engaging titles to these new audiences for the very first time. Kalamba Games CCO Andrew Crosby</p>
<p>Kalamba has been working hard to ensure that its products are out there and visible, using its in-house Bullseye RGS technology, which has made it possible to arrive in the shopping windows of more than 400 operators. The growth of regulated markets in the United States, though, has made more suppliers inclined to pursue expansion in the region.</p>
