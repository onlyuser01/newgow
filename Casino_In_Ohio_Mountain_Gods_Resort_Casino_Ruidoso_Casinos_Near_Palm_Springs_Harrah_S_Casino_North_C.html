    <h1>Casino In Ohio Mountain Gods Resort Casino Ruidoso Casinos Near Palm Springs Harrah S Casino North C</h1>

<p>Aggregator and content supplier Pariplay and leading provider of sports betting platforms for tier 1 operators Amelco signed an integration deal that will see operations of both parties across multiple US states beefed up, the operator of Pariplay Aspire Global announced in a press release.</p>
<p>Amelco Expands into iGaming</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal which marks an expansion into the iGaming space for the provider of trading, software and sports betting platforms, Amelco will integrate Pariplay’s premium Fusion platform into its full products and services offering.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy to partner with Pariplay, who brings a wealth of experience and a highly impressive platform to expand our offering. This deal is testament to our continued plans to expand across the US, as we aim to offer one of the most comprehensive sportsbook, casino and PAM platforms available stateside.” Brandon Walker, Head, Amelco US</p>
<p>The Fusion platform enables Pariplay to aggregate over 12,000 games from leading global content suppliers to boost its own proprietary titles such as high performers Stallion Fortunes, Mystery Fox and Dragons of the North, which Amelco will also gain access to via the new integration.</p>
<p>“This is yet another significant step in our strategy to establish a presence and build our brands in the US market. The US iGaming market is growing at an impressive rate and our objective is to be at forefront of the developments.” Tsachi Maimon, CEO, Aspire Global</p>
<p>Growth at Pariplay Continues</p>
<p>Over the course of last year, Aspire’s Pariplay saw several high-profile deals to bring content from several global suppliers into the aggregator platform and this trend continued in 2021. In the US, Pariplay is currently live in New Jersey with Rush Street Interactive, while launches in Pennsylvania and Michigan are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s parent Aspire Global posted record revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2020 and continued on the same note posting impressive financial performance in the first quarter of 2021, a quarter that also saw an Interim iGaming Supplier License granted to the company in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Last week, Aspire Global’s presence in the Latin American region expanded after Pariplay launched operations in Colombia in partnership with Codere, to add to the deals signed by Aspire’s subsidiary BtoBet for its sports and player account management (PAM) platform Neuron 3 to Betfair and William Hill.</p>
<p>Besides its gaming content, the licensed in 16 regulated markets across the world Pariplay platform offers operators a range of conversion and retention tools to improve engagement levels and boost customer acquisition.</p>
