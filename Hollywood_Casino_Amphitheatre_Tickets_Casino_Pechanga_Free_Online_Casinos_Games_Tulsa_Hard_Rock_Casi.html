<p>Better Collective has acquired two dominant sports betting brands in the United States, namely the Florida-based Vegas Insider and Scores and Odds. The agreed upon acquisition amounts to the price of 20 million USD for both websites and has been completed through Better Collective’s wholly-owned US subsidiary.</p>
<p>Each of the brands has established itself as a leader in the sports betting information niche. For more than 20 years now they’ve been operating on a business model based on selling American citizens betting tips in the states which allow online sports betting.</p>
<p>A Change in Tactics for Providing Sports Betting Information</p>
<p>Perspectives are promising, taking in mind that Vegas Insider and Scores and Odds generated a total of more than 15 million unique visits per month during the 2018/19 NFL season.</p>
<p>Vegas Insider has functioned with a clear purpose for more than 20 years, employing the tactics of providing thorough statistics and quality content to their readers. This has earned them a large amount of tried and true followers who, up until now, have purchased their picks on a daily basis or have been using a subscription model to acquire their information.</p>
<p>Scores and Odds, on the other hand, is a website which dates back to 1997 and provides its audience with statistics for sports games and odds comparisons.</p>
<p>With this acquisition complete and following another 21 million acquisition of the Rotogrinder Network back in May, Better Collective is aiming to provide US based sports betting enthusiasts with quality sports betting information using a different business model. The one employed in Europe so far – lead generation. The new model aims towards affiliate marketing within the sports betting industry.</p>
<p>Given that this new approach would require a complete overhaul in a technical and commercial aspect, Better Collective representatives have pointed out that they expect a decrease in revenue and earnings from the websites. This will be only temporary, though, as the refurbished subsidiaries are expected to contribute substantially from H2 2020.</p>
<p>Additionally, Better Collective is one among the few affiliate marketing companies licensed by the state of New Jersey to enter into revenue share relationships via the Ancillary Casino Service Industry Enterprise License.</p>
<p>A Better Future for Sports Betting in the US</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the necessary changes in the business models and refurbish the newly acquired potential, Better Collective has recruited 10 employees in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who will operate closely with the leading sports betting affiliate’s other active entities in Nashville, Tennessee and in New York.</p>
<p>“With the acquisition of the two mega-brands, VegasInsider.com and ScoresAndOdds.com, Better Collective is paving the way to expand the position as the market leading sports betting information company to include the US. These two webportals have the potential to become the largest revenue generating assets within Better Collective within the coming years.” – said Jesper Søgaard, CEO and co-founder of Better Collective.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CEO expressed his confidence in the decision to acquire Vegas Insider and Scores and Odds, as well as for the brighter future of both Better Collective and their new subsidiaries.</p>
