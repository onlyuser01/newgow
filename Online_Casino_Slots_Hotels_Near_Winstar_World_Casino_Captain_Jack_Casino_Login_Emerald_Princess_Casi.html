<p>LL Lucky Games AB’s co-founder and chief executive officer Mads Jørgensen spoke about the company being extremely proud to “introduce the world to Valholl Wild Hammers, a game that’s been high on our list of priorities for some time” after the success recorded by the hit hame Valholl Hall of the Slain. Jørgensen also discussed the way the original game includes a series of beloved game mechanics and features. He added the studio tool things “even further” on the new release. The game’s features are now “bigger, better, and more lucrative” for players ready to explore them.</p>
<p>Wild Hammers Free Spins, Loki’s Mischief &amp; Wild Lighting</p>
<p>The wilds within the game replace the rest of the symbols, allowing payers to finish up the winning combos. Wild symbols cannot replace coins and Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>At the head of each new round, players notice two hammers on random locations above the reels. Their position determines which of the following three features can be triggered:</p>
<p>The Wild Hammers Freespins Feature</p>
<p>If the two hammers land on reels from one to six, they activate 10 Free Spins. During the Free Spins rounds, the same hammers start shooting lightning on the reels, replacing one or two symbols with sticky wilds. The sticky wild symbols remain in their positions for the remainder of the round. When the same Wilds are hit by lightning, they are given a multiplier that is added to random payline wins related to the wild. Players get five more free spins provided they get a Wild symbol on all six reels.</p>
<p>Loki’s Mischiefs Feature</p>
<p>This is the second feature than can be enabled by the top hammers landing on adjacent reels. It causes two symbols to be marked on the reels. All identical symbols are replaced by Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Wild Lightning Feature</p>
<p>To trigger this feature, players must see the two hammers land over the same reel. In exchange, the entire reel is filled with Wild symbols.</p>
<p>The developer has also introduced the Gamble Feature. Players can use it to try to increase their wins by betting on red or black or choosing a card suit bet that could boost their win four times. The fresh game also comes with a new Buy Bonus feature that lets players instantly reach the bonus round.</p>
<p>At the end of May, Lady Luck Gaming’s parent company LL Lucky Games acquired ReelNRG, a gaming studio in London.</p>
