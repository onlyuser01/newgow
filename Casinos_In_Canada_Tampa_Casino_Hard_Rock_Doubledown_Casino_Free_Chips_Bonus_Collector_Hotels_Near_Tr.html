<p>Nevada Casino Revenue Tops $1B for 18th Consecutive Month, August Win Totals $1.2B</p>

<p>Nevada casino revenue has topped $1 billion in each of the previous 18 months, an unprecedented streak that seemingly has no end in sight despite a host of economic headwinds.</p>

<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) says August’s gross gaming revenue totaled more than $1.2 billion. August was 3.5% better than a year ago and more impressive was that last month represented a 27% premium on August 2019.</p>
<p>“Nevada continued to record gaming win amounts in excess of pre-pandemic levels in August with $1.2 billion in win,” said Michael Lawton, senior economic analyst for the NGCB.</p>
<p>August was powered by another strong showing on the Las Vegas Strip. Clark County casinos won a little more than $1 billion, with the Strip accounting for $659.7 million of the gaming haul.</p>
<p>Statewide, slots won $847.1 million off of gamblers — up 2.5% year-over-year. The house also fared well on tables, revenue from felt coming in north of $361.3 million, 6% better than August 2021.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers kept $16.1 million of the sports bets wagered on a 4% hold rate. Handle, or the total amount risked, was $408.7 million.</p>
<p>August Rebound</p>
<p>There were some concerns following July’s NGCB report that showed gaming declined from 2021. Though the state’s casinos still won more than $1.3 billion, July 2022 was off more than 3% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Lawton says the alarms that were sounded last month — that record inflation might be beginning to slow the post-pandemic demand for Las Vegas and Nevada — were without merit.</p>
<p>I think people forget that July 2021 was an all-time record for any month, so it was not a surprise that this July might miss the mark,” Lawton said. “However, August came in about where I had anticipated, down 8.2% sequentially compared to July.</p>
<p>“Historically, August has averaged close to a 9% decrease compared to July, which I figured, if that held true, we would see an increase year-over-year more than August 2021,” Lawton detailed.</p>
<p>Nevada casinos, which set an all-time revenue record last year, with GGR totaling more than $13.4 billion, are on pace to set yet another new mark with just four reporting months to go in 2022.</p>
<p>Visitor Volume Strong</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index, the federal government’s inflation benchmark, showed that prices for goods and services increased 8.3% year-over-year in August 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average contracted 4% — or almost 1,300 points.</p>
<p>Despite the economic unease, Las Vegas continued to see gamblers and visitors return to Southern Nevada in August 2022.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority today said approximately 3.19 million people traveled to the casino hub last month — 6.4% better than August 2021 but still considerably below August 2019.</p>
<p>Las Vegas casinos are winning more money off of gamblers. Despite welcoming 3.19 million people last month — about 380,000 fewer people than came to Las Vegas in August 2019 — Clark County’s gaming income was 29% higher last month.</p>
<p>Air traffic to Southern Nevada also continues to rebound and inch closer to 2019 levels. Harry Reid International is fresh off its best three-month period, and passenger traffic through eight months in 2022 is within 2% of 2019.</p>
