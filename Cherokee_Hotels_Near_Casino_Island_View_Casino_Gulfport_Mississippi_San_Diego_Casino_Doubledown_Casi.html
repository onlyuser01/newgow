<p>The independent body focused on ensuring the integrity of tennis, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced a new sanction against a professional player after uncovering a record number of breaches. On Thursday, the ITIA said that it imposed a sanction against Moroccan former tennis player Younes Rachidi.</p>
<p>The sanction comes after the Agency found the player guilty of a record number of 135 match-fixing offenses. This staggering number is a new record not only for the ITIA but for its predecessor, the Tennis Integrity Unit, as well.</p>
<p>Rachidi received a lifetime ban in light of the record number of breaches. Moreover, the ex-tennis pro player, who had the highest ATP doubles ranking of 473 also received a $34,000 fine. According to a statement released by the ITIA, the latest case was ruled by Janie Soubli√®re, an independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Agency uncovered that the Moroccan player was involved in match-fixing along with two other players from Algeria. The two players were also banned by the ITIA after an investigation conducted along with law enforcement in Belgium.</p>
<p>The tennis integrity watchdog explained that the 135 offenses of the Moroccan players related to breaches of the 2017 and 2018 Tennis Anti-Corruption Programs (TACP). The ex-tennis player breached rule D.1.d, which forbids any individual involved in professional tennis, also referred to as a covered person, to "directly or indirectly, contrive or attempt to contrive the outcome or any other aspect of any Event."</p>
<p>The Moroccan player breached rule D.1.e, which forbids covered individuals from asking or engaging in actions that impact their best efforts or the efforts of other players within any event. The ITIA said that Rachidi also breached rule D.1.f, which prohibits individuals from accepting any money or other benefits with the intention of impacting the best efforts of any player within any event.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tennis player was found guilty of breaching rule D.1.g, which forbids any covered person from offering money or other benefits to other covered people with the intention of impacting their performance negatively within any event. Finally, Rachidi breached D.2.a.i, a rule that mandates players to contact the ITIA if they are approached by any individual offering money or trying to influence negatively the result of any tennis event.</p>
<p>Rachidi's lifetime ban means that he can no longer play or coach at any tennis event sanctioned by the governing bodies of tennis. Moreover, the permanent sanction restricts him from even attending any tennis event sanctioned or authorized by the tennis governing bodies.</p>
<p>The latest enforcement action comes after only recently, the ITIA issued another ban. Last week, the tennis integrity watchdog banned 33-year-old French tennis player, Sherazad Reix, after he was found guilty of match-fixing. Overall, the ITIA uncovered six breaches which resulted in a four-year ban for Reix.</p>
