<p>Licensed gambling operators in Nevada enjoyed strong results in October, judging by details released by the gambling regulator in the state.</p>
<p>Nevada Regulator Reveals October Report</p>
<p>The gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), released its latest report Tuesday outlining the performance of licensed operators during the last month. In total, the gaming win reported by nonrestricted gaming operators last month hit $1.28 billion. This result, when compared to the $1.22 billion result from October 2021, marked an increase of 4.83%.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bigger picture, last month marked another successful month for the operators, considering that it is the twentieth month in a row with revenues surpassing $1 billion. Additional details released by the NGCB reveal that the gaming win increased by 3.02% for the fiscal year which is the period between July 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022, when compared to the corresponding period last year.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the increase in gaming win resulted in an increase in taxes as well. Overall, the taxes for October this year hit $76.4 million, marking a 6.42% increase when compared to the $71.8 million reported for the same period in 2021.</p>
<p>Different Counties Report an Increase in Gaming Win</p>

The gaming win for Clark County in October hit $1.10 billion, marking an increase of 4.52% when compared to October 2021. The Las Vegas Strip reported the majority of the gaming win hitting $705.8 million, up by less than 1%.</p>
