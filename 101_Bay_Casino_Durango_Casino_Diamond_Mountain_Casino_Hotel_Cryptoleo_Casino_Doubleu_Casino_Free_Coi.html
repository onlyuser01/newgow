    <h1>101 Bay Casino Durango Casino Diamond Mountain Casino Hotel Cryptoleo Casino Doubleu Casino Free Coi</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>on September 30th I made a deposit of 51€ on Duxcasino. After playing for a few hours I wanted to withdraw my winnings of 1130.06€.</p>
<p>My withdrawal was declined because I had to verify my account first. So I uploaded my documents and they were all accepted except my ID. They wanted a photo instead of a scan. Then they declined the photo aswell and wanted another one on a different background. I tried to upload the new photo and was kicked out of my account. Couldn't log in anymore. Asked the chat what's going on, apparently I closed an account in one of the casinos in their group.</p>
<p>However I didn't breach any terms, in another case the casino group made this statement in july 2020 (on askgamblers):</p>
<p>"According to the information provided to N1 Casino, you have independently installed in your account self-exclusion at Spinia Casino on June 2. In this case, the limit does not apply to other projects licensed by N1 Interactive. As soon as you have notified the casino of gamblings problems(June 30), your account was blocked.</p>
<p>We would like to mention when a player puts a self-exclusion without any signs of gambling problems, a self-exclusion period sets up just for one project where it was initiated, not for all casinos under the same license."</p>
<p>I also never mentioned having gambling problems, so my other accounts shouldn't be limited.</p>
<p>Under MGA licenses, self exclusion is per brand, not licence. So I was allowed to sign up and play on this casino.</p>
<p>I've sent them all the required documents and bank details but haven't received my withdrawal yet.</p>
