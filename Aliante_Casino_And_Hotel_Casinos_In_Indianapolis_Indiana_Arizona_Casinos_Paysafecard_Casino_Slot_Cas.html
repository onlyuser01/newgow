<p>The integration of fresh iGaming titles will help HappyCasino and LuckyCasino maintain their leading positions</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming, a supplier of premium iGaming content, has struck a new deal to supply the Malta-based Glitnor Group with content. As agreed, two of the latter company’s gaming brands will integrate Hacksaw games into their offerings.</p>
<p>The partnership will see the supplier power its new partner’s HappyCasino and LuckyCasino brands with its full portfolio of games. As a result, their players will be able to play some of the best titles Hacksaw Gaming has to offer, including Wanted Dead or a Wild, Dork Unit, Chaos Crew and the award-winning R.I.P. City.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has been supplying operators with premium slots ever since its foundation in 2018. The studio strives to disrupt the online gambling sector through its innovative, user-driven tech and games.</p>
<p>The company is headquartered in Malta and is available in more than 20 regulated jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Malta, Italy, Germany, Ontario, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Romania and West Virginia, among others. Glitnor Group will therefore join an international list of operators using Hacksaw’s Games.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Help Glitnor Maintain Its Momentum</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming’s chief commercial officer, Gabrielle Star, commented on the deal, saying that partnering with Glitnor Group will expand her company’s reach in many regulated markets. This notably includes Sweden where the operator is very popular.</p>
<p>Star added that the gambling company has the same values as Hacksaw Gaming.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group shares our vision for a mobile-first world driven by next-gen technology. We’re excited to showcase some real showstoppers like Wanted Dead or a Wild, R.I.P. City and Chaos Crew to a brand-new audience. Gabrielle Star, CCO, Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Glitnor Group’s head of games, Sven da Waard, also released a statement on the deal. He said that he is excited to bring Hacksaw Gaming titles to LuckyCasino and HappyCasino players, further boosting engagement.</p>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity for us to deliver innovative and entertaining gaming experiences to our customers that they won’t find anywhere else. Sven da Waard, head of games, Glitnor Group</p>
<p>Glitnor Group holds Sweden and MGA licenses and is one of the powerhouses in the European online gambling market. The company is known for its focus on Sweden and its dedication to innovation and excellent gaming content.</p>
<p>Speaking of innovation, Glitnor Group’s LuckyCasino, which launched in 2018, was one of the first companies to adopt Trustly’s Pay N Play method, which makes registering and depositing money a seamless and intuitive process. Glitnor believes that the addition of this revolutionary tech helped LuckyCasino cement itself as the fastest-growing gambling brand in Sweden.</p>
