<p>The leading iGaming technology provider delivering products, services and solutions for online gambling operators, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), confirmed Thursday it extended its existing partnership with the global gaming and entertainment brand, bet365. The latest partnership extension involves GiG Comply, GiG's leading automated affiliate marketing compliance tool.</p>
<p>The unique tool enables companies operating within different jurisdictions around the globe to stay compliant with the varying regulations. Undoubtedly, the solution will bring further benefits for bet365, which is a company that has a strong presence within the global iGaming sector, catering to more than 90 million customers around the world.</p>
<p>GiG Comply takes a proactive automated approach by scanning operators' websites for iGaming code red words and links. This analysis enables the operators to restrict or allow certain specific items in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>By leveraging GiG Comply, operators can ensure that they remain compliant with the regulations within different jurisdictions. This, in turn, can help prevent licensing issues such as penalties, extra license conditions or even revocation.</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for bet365 commented on the topic saying: "We look forward to continuing our partnership with GiG Comply. Their automated compliance solution is a valuable tool in helping to maintain a compliant affiliate program globally."</p>
<p>Currently, GiG Media, GiG's leading iGaming affiliate business, is famous within the iGaming vertical as a company that offers its services to operators around the world, helping them "generate qualified traffic through multiple channels, including SEM/PPC and social media." Recently, GiG Media has seen exponential growth by signing a major partnership with News Corp in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>GiG Media's Chief Marketing Officer, Jonas Warrer, was similarly excited about the expanded deal with bet365. "Extending our partnership with bet365, one of the leading names in the industry, is a worthwhile indication of the confidence it provides our partners in the affiliate market and the strength of the team we have in GiG Media," he explained.</p>
<p>The extended collaboration with GiG comes after recently, bet365 inked a deal with Pragmatic Play for the market in Ontario, Canada. Thanks to the partnership inked earlier this month, the leading provider of games agreed to deliver its titles for bet365 customers in the province.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, a spokesperson for bet365 welcomed the unique games provided by Pragmatic Play. Additionally, the spokesperson predicted that the customers in Ontario are going to like the engaging and thrilling new titles.</p>
