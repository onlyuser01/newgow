    <h1>Morongo Casino Resort Spa Kansas Star Casino Casinos Near Chicago Mt Airy Lodge Casino Casino Norfol</h1>

<p>One of the world’s leading content aggregator providers will offer its vast network of games to access Spribe’s outstanding crash games, among others</p>
<p>Innovative and focused on creating fresh and out-of-the-box experiences, Spribe will benefit from Groove’s partner network which includes hundreds of operators that are looking for worthwhile additions to their gaming libraries.</p>
<p>Aviator’s Spribe to Take Off with More Casinos Now</p>
<p>Spribe is hailed as one of the most successful developers in the crash-style genre, with its game, Aviator, becoming the world’s leading and most popular title in this vertical. The tie-up will allow Spribe to quickly take off with both its crash games and instant games and introduce them to Groove’s network.</p>
<p>From there, players will have access to the acclaimed Aviator game which presently attracts more than 5 million monthly active users, making it indeed the most-played game in this particular genre. Aviator is based on a very simple premise where players make a bet, fly off in a plane and have to eject before the plane crashes.</p>
<p>The higher the plane soars, the better the potential payout becomes. Apart from Aviator, Spribe will also be deploying its Turbo Games, which include popular choices such as Dice, Plinko, Goal, HiLo, Hotline, Mines, and Keno. The integration proves an important milestone for both companies.</p>
<p>Groove COO Yahale Meltzer has said that it was great to see another fantastic supplier of games added to the platform. Meltzer assured that the company’s job was to bring and equip its partners with the most relevant and fun games.</p>
<p>Spribe and Groove Welcome Opportunity to Deliver the Best Content</p>
<p>The CCO wrapped up by saying that the Turbo Games genre adds variety, quality and more to the offer, saying:</p>
<p>Aviator has taken the market by storm and is one of the most popular games in the world right now. Groove COO Yahale Meltzer</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by Spribe managing partner &amp; co-founder David Natroshvili who said that Groove was an important partner as it already offered its content and services to some of the world’s leading iGaming brands.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Spribe will also be able to inject its content and its leading game, Aviator, with many prominent brands.</p>
<p>“This makes it an important partnership for us, boosting the distribution of all our titles with power player iGaming brands in markets worldwide,” Natroshvili said. Spribe also recently launched in the Ontario iGaming market with its crash-style games.</p>
