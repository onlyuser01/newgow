    <h1>St Joseph Frontier Casino Robert De Niro Movie Casino Hollywood Casino Near Me Casino Hours Ellis Is</h1>

<p>this is the screen shot showing I won 3000 comin 3rd in the tournament</p>
<p>this is the screenshot showing the pay table for placing in the tournament and the actual amount you win kind of thing</p>
<p>i also have a letter from them stating I did place and the monies would be put in the game account so when I log o to the game I would be able to collect and then from my player account I would be able to withdraw it once I am verified</p>
<p>they tried to tell me I was banned because I used a card that was not in my name. But there terms and Deb conditions quite clearly state that the person whose account this is should be responsible and legally allowed to use rhe card from which I am as this is actually my account and I only used this card a few times and it’s not the card which I won any monies on. It has my daughters name on it because she is to young to ope. Up a bank account so the bank allowed me to put her name on one of my accounts which I am legally responsible for so that she can learn the value of saving money. So based on there terms and conditions I have not broken any of there rules or laws. And besides I used another card which is in my name for a couple of months after this and they took the money amd ili won with a newer card in my name then all of a sudden I hit the withdraw button and they send me a letter stating that once I with draw the money in the player account. I will be permanently banned. With no mention to the tournament money or 3000, or the other 2600 which was originally pending withdraw . However at this stage I’m only chasing the 3000 of my winnings from a the tournament .</p>
