<p>The European iGaming affiliate company, Oddspedia, has signed an advertising deal with Real Madrid to grow its brand awareness and reach the right audience by stepping off the digital platform.</p>
<p>Real Madrid to Feature Oddspedia to Gain More Brand Awareness</p>
<p>Oddspedia, the all-in-one iGaming platform that delivers live scores and real-time odds updates, has signed a deal with Real Madrid to raise its brand awareness. The company aims to provide user-friendly service to sports betting players worldwide. Oddspedia is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian. Currently, it is more focused on the Spanish-speaking markets.</p>
<p>During the remainder of the season 2020/2021, Oddspedia will be advertised at Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano stadium in Madrid, Spain. It will be advertised at the El Clasico vs. Barcelona match on April 11 and during Real Madrid’s home games. The stadium is usually used for training by the legendary team, but now it is hosting matches due to the reconstruction of Santiago Bernabéu.</p>
<p>According to Oddspedia, partnering up with teams like Real Madrid would prove ‘very effective in creating a higher level of recognition.’ This deal comes when Oddspedia is looking for new means to engage with fans and gain more awareness, using more traditional media platforms.</p>
<p>Real Madrid recently signed a multi-year partnership with the Russian bookmaker, Fonbet. Under the deal, the latter will become the legendary football club’s official betting partner in Russia.</p>
<p>Oddspedia Is Taking a Step Towards More Traditional Advertising</p>
<p>Oddspedia aims to reach the right audience. Its focus is brand exposure and engaging with its top fans. The advertising methods will include pitch-side boards and advanced digital overlay technology that would allow geo-targeted broadcasts.</p>
<p>Jan Möller, the co-founder of Oddspedia, said that he is thrilled to work with one of the most successful football clubs in history. He said that he is excited to see Oddspedia featured on Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano. Möller also stated that this is the company’s first attempt to go beyond digital advertising, and it is a great way to start the year off. To expand its fanbase, even more, Oddspedia will also use TV advertising.</p>
<p>Oddspedia Compares Information from More Than 80 Bookmakers</p>
<p>Oddspedia’s goal is to provide sports fans, bettors, and publishers all of the information they need, in a user-friendly way, worldwide. Last September, the company launched its Sport Data Widgets for publishers, adding more sports coverage and giving the platform a complete makeover.</p>
<p>It also added more sports coverage. That includes statistics, real-time updates, faster live scores, and betting odds information. The platform compares information from more than 80 bookmakers worldwide, providing its fans with the tools to compare and check the odds both before and during the match.</p>
