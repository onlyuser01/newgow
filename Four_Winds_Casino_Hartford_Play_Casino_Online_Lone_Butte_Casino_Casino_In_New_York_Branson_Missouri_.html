<p>Addabbo continues to fight for the legalization of iGaming, arguing that it would benefit the entire state</p>
<p>True to his word, Senator Joseph Addabbo introduced a new iGaming bill in New York. The measure, dubbed Senate Bill 8185 was referred to the Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee yesterday and seeks to authorize interactive gaming and interactive lottery gaming in The Empire State.</p>
<p>Addabbo, who’s a staunch supporter of the launch of online casino gaming in the state, also tried to get the vertical legalized in 2023. His previous bill, S4856, also sought to get digital gambling legalized. However, a major difference is that the previous bill did not include online lottery.</p>
<p>In any case, S4856 failed to gain traction and never yielded results. However, this did not stop Addabbo from promoting the launch of online gambling in New York.</p>
<p>Under S8185, New York’s seven land-based casinos, racetracks and tribes will be eligible to apply for online gambling licenses. The potential bidding process will also handle three additional licenses to parties that submit a program that gets the commission’s approval.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the main difference from last year’s bill is that S8185 also includes the legalization of online lottery. Per the proposal, New York would allow players to access joint, multi-jurisdiction and out-of-state lotteries online. Ticket sales would be overseen by the New York State Division of Lottery.</p>
<p>Addabbo Says New York Would Benefit from the Legalization</p>
<p>Applicants will have to pay a one-time license fee to secure their license. Existing operators, for example, will be required to pay $2 million for a license. Independent contractors, however, will need to pay $10 million.</p>
<p>In addition, potential applicants should prepare to face significant taxes as S8185 envisions a 30.5% gross gaming revenue tax. Mirroring New York betting’s controversial (and according to some operators unsustainable) tax, Addabbo plans to set high taxation rates for operators. As per the bill, $11 million of this money will be distributed by the Commission and the Office of Addiction Services and Supports for problem gambling-related services.</p>
<p>Under the current version of the bill, only players above the age of 21 will be allowed to play online.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Senator commented on the matter, saying that the legislation would greatly benefit New York, significantly alleviating its rising financial pressures. He said:</p>
<p>Other states are doing it and taking our money. And if I hear my analysts in the industry correctly, we lose about a billion dollars a year. How long can we sit on the sidelines? Senator Addabbo</p>
<p>New York is currently America’s largest betting market, constantly posting record-breaking figures. Addabbo and other online gambling supporters hope to replicate this success and generate more tax revenue for the state.</p>
