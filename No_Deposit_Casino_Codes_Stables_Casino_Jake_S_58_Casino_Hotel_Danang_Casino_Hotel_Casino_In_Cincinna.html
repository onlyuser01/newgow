<p>Jelly is happy to partner up with EQL Games, as it allows the former to strengthen its presence in the lottery segment, and also benefit from EQL’s RGS technology, a Remote Gaming Server solution that makes it possible to deliver games in a lightsome and tight fashion to end consumers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jelly will be able to integrate its new products developed with EQL directly with lotteries from around the globe and vendor systems. EQL Games for its part is committed to bringing more innovative content to the segment and industry.</p>
<p>This will now be facilitated through the addition of Jelly Entertainment. EQL Games CEO Brad Cummings has hailed the partnership as fundamental and said that the new alliance played an important part in his company’s further efforts to establish itself as a leader in the lottery vertical.
