<p>NFL players Baker and Dunbar have accused of armed robbery at a party on Wednesday night, earlier this week.</p>
<p>NFL Baker and Dunbar Suspects in Armed Robbery</p>
<p>Deandre Baker and Quinton Dunbar who play for the NFL were temporarily on Florida police’s wanted list. The two players are accused of an alleged armed robbery which took place on Wednesday. Arrest warrants were issued by the Miramar police on Thursday. Yesterday, May 16, the two cornerbacks surrendered to the Broward Sheriff Office’s (BSO) Main Jail in Florida.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Deandre Baker playing for the New York Giants was wanted on four counts of aggravated assault and four counts of armed robbery with a firearm. Meanwhile, the 27-year-old Quinton Dunbar who is playing for the Seattle Seahawks, is wanted on four counts of armed robbery with a firearm.</p>
<p>The Miramar Police Report on Wednesday’s Robbery</p>
<p>The police report placed Dunbar and Quinton at a party this Wednesday. According to the report and the four witnesses described as victims, the two men were involved in an argument at a card table. Quinton and Dunbar then allegedly turned over the card table and flashed guns in the faces of the victims. Following this, the two men took a $25,000 Hublot watch, a $17,500 Audemars Piguet watch, a $18,000 Rolex watch and more than $12,000 in cash, the report says.</p>

<p>Following the robbery, the men allegedly fled the scene with three different vehicles, which according to witnesses were parked in a convenient way for a quick escape. According to the authorities, one of the victims met Dunbar and Baker at a party in Miami few days prior to the incident. According to the victim, the two NFL players have lost around $70,000 gambling at that party.</p>
<p>The NFL and Baker’s Lawyer Respond on The Accusations</p>
<p>Deandre Baker’s lawyer Bradford Cohen shared on Instagram a good word for the Miramar Police Department saying they: “were accommodating and went out of their way to assure Mr Bakers privacy during this hard time.” Cohen continued that in his long practice of 23 years he was defending those who are wrongly treated or wrongly charged. He concluded by saying: “Don’t rush to judgement.”</p>
<p>The response from New York Giants was rather brief and the league noted: “We are aware of the situation. We have been in contact with DeAndre. We have no further comment at this time.” Similar to the Giants, Seattle Seahawks said: “We are aware of the situation involving Quinton Dunbar and still gathering information.” Given the investigation that is pending they refrained from commenting any further.</p>
<p>The pair have been granted bail just a few hours before publishing.</p>
