<p>Information about Mexico casinos</p>
<p>One of the most important things for any online casino player is having a safe and enjoyable gaming experience. It's no different for players in Mexico, who have a number of places to choose from when looking for a reliable site.</p>
<p>This page is dedicated to helping you find the best Mexico-friendly casinos out there. Here, you can read about how Casino Guru reviews and rates each site, and how you can use our filters to find the best option for you. There's also information about land-based and online gambling regulations in Mexico.</p>

<p>Land-based gambling in Mexico</p>
<p>Mexico is a country with a history of gambling culture that stretches back to the time of the Aztecs, however, many forms of betting were declared illegal by President Cardenas in 1935. This didn't stop 'black market' gambling from happening, though, so the Federal Games and Raffles Law was introduced in 1947 to permit betting in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The country still follows the law to this day, but its draconian nature has led to many attempts to bring it up to modern standards. In 2004, the Ministry of the Interior (SEGOB) relaxed the rules, allowing the operation of number-based casino games, such as roulette and slots, along with sports betting. Any betting entity wishing to offer these had to gain a government-approved license, with strict punishments for those who operated without one.</p>
<p>While the industry remains unregulated, there are around 300 licensed bricks-and-mortar casinos in the country today, which all add to the country's tax revenue. Cancun is a gambling hotspot with its superb tourist facilities, while capital Mexico City also has many betting establishments for visitors to choose from.</p>
<p>Note: Players in Mexico can enjoy safe gambling in these licensed venues but venturing to unlicensed places is not a good idea: they are not held to any official standards so may not pay out on winnings or treat their clients well.</p>
<p>Mexico online gambling</p>
<p>Mexican law doesn't hold a specific legal definition of online gambling as the country still follows the 1947 Act. However, there have been several moves since to recognize the activity.</p>
<p>The Draft Gambling Bill of 2014 defines it as gambling activity conducted on an electrical device connected to the internet. Like with land-based operators, online casinos in Mexico must hold a license granted by SEGOB. As well as this, they must demonstrate that they have adequate operating conditions, such as a reliable remote betting system. There's one catch, however. Mexican citizens aren't allowed to play on them, so they can only provide games to overseas players.</p>
<p>However, this national restriction on citizens doesn't apply to sites outside of Mexico, so players in Mexico can make use of many offshore sites. To emphasise this point, it's perfectly legal for players in Mexico to visit foreign online casinos, as there is nothing that forbids them from doing so. However, finding a reliable casino is still important and the next section will explore how to do this in more detail.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Mexico-friendly online casino</p>
<p>The rise in online casinos means there are many iGaming options for players in Mexico to consider. Variety is the spice of life, but it also means that players have to be vigilant against below-par gambling sites that might not pay out on winnings or have poor customer support.</p>
<p>This page will help you focus on the very best Mexico-friendly casinos out there. You'll be able to find these by using our in-depth rating and review system, in which our team of experts strictly assess each site's quality, and you can find the best of these by using the page's filters.</p>
<p>Starting with the 'Recommended' tab: when you highlight this, you'll get the highest scoring online casinos, according to our team. Stick with these for the best bet of a great online experience. The 'Newly opened' tab, meanwhile, gives you the latest sites added to our system, but these may not score as highly for now. The 'All' tab will then draw up all the available options for you.</p>
<p>You can also use other filters to narrow your options down further. In the filters list, you can find your preferred payment provider by ticking the relevant option in the 'Payment Method' section. Casinos that accept Visa and Paypal, two popular providers in Mexico, can be found by doing this.</p>
<p>Note: To get a comprehensive look at finding a great online casino, Casino Guru's How to choose an online casino article covers everything on the topic. Check it out to get the full lowdown on this.</p>
<p>How to find online casino bonuses available to Mexican players</p>
<p>Many online casinos offer welcome bonuses as a kind of promotion to tempt players to sign up, and these are paid after the player's first — and sometimes second or third — deposit. Sometimes a player doesn't even need to make a deposit to receive one, and these are known as no deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>The good news is that a good number of Mexico-friendly casinos offer these bonuses, and Casino Guru can help you to find them. To get a list of these, head to go to our list of casino bonuses and select 'Mexico' in the 'For players from' filter.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to sort them by type: if so, go to 'Bonus Type' and choose a particular variety, so for no deposit bonuses, just click the 'No Deposit Bonus' box. You can also go to our list of no deposit bonuses and choose 'Mexico' there, or see a dedicated list of no deposit bonuses for Mexican players if you wish.</p>
<p>Our team works hard to keep all the above options up to date so that you will never find expired or useless bonuses.</p>
