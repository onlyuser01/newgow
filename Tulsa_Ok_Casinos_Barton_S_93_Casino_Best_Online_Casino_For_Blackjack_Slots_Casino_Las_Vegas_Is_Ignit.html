    <h1>Tulsa Ok Casinos Barton S 93 Casino Best Online Casino For Blackjack Slots Casino Las Vegas Is Ignit</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has expanded its presence in the Latin American market as the company teamed up with Joy Enterprise’s Playr.bet</p>
<p>The partnership is established for a period of five years, subject to extension, and GiG will be the go-to platform account management or PAM provider for Playr.bet during this period. This will allow the brand to pivot towards new opportunities in the regional online gaming market.</p>
<p>Another Big Stride in the Latin American Market</p>
<p>GiG’s PAM system is a powerful tool that is an agile instrument, allowing companies to leverage it online as well as to support their retail operations. This creates the opportunity to create an omnichannel experience that further elevates a partner company’s profile.</p>
<p>Joy Entertainment director Luis Mussi welcomed this opportunity and hailed it as an important development for his company. He spoke about GiG’s own contributions:</p>
<p>This is a new venture into an unknown vertical for us and it was clear from the start that GiG’s technology would enable us to access the opportunities inherent within our existing customer base. Joy Entertainment director Luis Mussi</p>
<p>Mussi was particularly pleased with the new partner’s offer as he saw it as a partner that is hoping to help address the challenges that lie ahead as well as bolster the current operations.</p>
<p>GiG’s process is thorough and carefully through-through to provide partners with everything they need to remain competitive, the executive noted. He was joined by GiG’s own chief executive, Richard Brown, who was similarly pleased with the opportunity:</p>
<p>Delivering new revenue streams for organizations with established online customers is at the core of what we can offer. GiG CEO Richard Brown</p>
<p>Brown said that his company took pride in bringing the technology necessary to strengthen prominent operators’ businesses and help them move forward. It’s also an opportunity to build relationships with new partners. GiG has more than 25 years of experience in the delivery of in-demand solutions for brands and operators in the iGaming and betting sectors.</p>
<p>GiG Continues to Build Up European Momentum</p>
<p>GiG has been working to actively expand its footprint in global markets and has been successful. The company recently signed an agreement to provide cloud-based products and platform services &amp; performance marketing for an unnamed entity in the iGaming industry earlier this week.</p>
<p>GiG also entered into a similar partnership with an unnamed company in Switzerland, “an established land-based and digital casino operator” in the country.</p>
