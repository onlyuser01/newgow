    <h1>Eagle Pass Casino Charles Town Casino Goldfish Casino Free Coins Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino</h1>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in response, I did not see this until now. I only saw the discussion post about it and this was my reply to it.</p>
<p>The reason his account was reopened was not because we wanted to do so but because he asked multiple times to reopen it.</p>
<p>He was betting happily, depositing happily, and chatting with our live support happily. We have screenshots of every single message and image sent, post your request for account closure.</p>
<p>We will not attach the screenshots to preserve privacy of his part but after seeing the screenshots you would agree that it was not our decision to open the account and he wanted to reopen it.</p>
<p>In addition to reopening, he requested multiple bonuses, free spins, cashback, and the use of other forms of payment methods.</p>
<p>We understand that gambling addiction can be a problem but if he would have won money, this discussion would never happen. It is unfair to us that 15 days after the request to reopen the account was made, he then request money back.</p>
<p>This would be equivalent if he won and we blocked his withdrawal because of the request he decided to overturn 15 days previously. We would never do this.</p>
<p>While we are human and do care about protecting our players, it is not only the casinoâ€™s responsibility to practice responsible gaming but it is also on the player themselves which we offer resources to speak to and get the help that one might need if it becomes uncontrollable.</p>
<p>We know our live support had a really nice time getting to know him and really enjoyed speaking with him. We hope everything goes well with him and his future and hope that these losses are not causing a severe impact to you.</p>
<p>If he would like to discuss further offline where we can share screenshots of our chat with him he can do so at support@delorocasino.com. We do not wish to publicize these images online.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Del Oro Casino and Sportsbook Team</p>
