<p>Morgana Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is ruled by the seductive sorceress Morgana.</p>
<p>Loosely themed on Arthurian legend, this world is packed with dragons, magic, and cryptic symbols. The game is set in a firelit hall straight out of a rollicking medieval fantasy.</p>
<p>Morgana stares down players with the force of a confident dominatrix. Her body-sculpting armour bodice and black cape do not detract from this effect. There is no doubt she’s the one in charge and players will want to stay on her good side.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is fun, though the style is more reminiscent of a children’s movie than high-budget fantasy. Morgana’s sex appeal, however, makes it clear this is a world for adults.</p>
<p>Win in the Morgana Megaways slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music brings to mind the Game of Thrones with its mystical tone. It substantially adds to the feeling of being in a magical place.</p>
<p>The animation style definitely seems like something from a Saturday morning cartoon special. It’s lively, but does not ask to be taken too seriously.</p>
<p>The bright colour palette is eye-catching, and dragon banners softly fluttering beside the reels are gorgeous. Morgana herself is the highlight with her flame-hued hair and intense gaze.</p>
<p>Players may find the many flickering torches around the reels distracting, and annoyingly there is no way to moderate them. For players in the right mood, this may create a cosy environment to play.</p>
<p>Big win in the Morgana Megaways slot machine</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Morgana Megaways is a six reel, five row slot. This slot uses the Megaways System, an any way wins system, meaning that matching symbols in anywhere adjacent reels result in wins.</p>
<p>The Megaways System also randomises the number of symbols on each reel (between 2 and 7). As a result, there are up to 117,649 ways to win each spin.</p>
<p>Max Megaways can be triggered on any paid spin, forcing every reel to have the maximum symbols.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. The Wild only appears on reels 2,3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>When three Scatter symbols appear, this triggers Free Spins.</p>
<p>Players can collect symbols to award a multiplier prize, additional Free Spins, and boost the minimum Megaways.</p>
<p>Free spins feature can be improved several times</p>
<p>Players can obtain the Morgana bet for x80 their total bet. This guarantees a Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.98%, nearly exactly our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for standard symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this medieval fantasy-themed slot with its average RTP and high volatility.</p>
<p>The graphics and animation set an entertaining mood and Morgana herself proves to be a charismatic host.</p>
<p>The sense of story is strong and players will enjoy a journey into this magical realm, perhaps especially because it is a throwback to more childlike tales.</p>
<p>The popular Megaways system of gameplay keeps players engaged and provides ample fun.</p>
