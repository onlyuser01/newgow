<p>PointsBet has taken another swing in the sports world as the sportsbook teamed up with golf club leisure and hospitality services firm Troon. The partnership is a first for PointsBet and will turn the operator into the official and exclusive sports betting partner for the management company.</p>
<p>As a result, PointsBet’s signage will feature across Troon’s social media, and the operator will establish print and web presence across Troon’s assets, including the company’s dedicated app. Troon, which manages various golf facilities, will now feature the PointsBet brand in visible places allowing PointsBet to reach new audiences and reinforce its presence with existing fans.</p>
<p>Troon will use PointsBet’s expertise in betting to offer odds integrations and numerous golf-centric collaborations at locations throughout the country. Meanwhile, VIP customers at PointsBet will have another hospitality experience to enjoy as part of the operator’s loyalty program.</p>
<p>PointsBet is also planning to host a golf tournament by the name of PointsBet Cup, deepening the partnership and pivoting it towards an esports angle. Commenting on this partnership, PointsBet CCO Eric Foote pointed out the numerous synergies the company has already achieved in the realm of golf experiences:</p>
<p>“Between our partnership with NBC Sports, The Golf Channel, and PGA TOUR, PointsBet has shown a commitment to the sport of golf through investment of our brand in the space.” PointsBet CCO Eric Foote</p>
<p>Connecting and Building on New Experiences</p>
<p>PointsBet has long been ambitious about expanding its presence in golf, and the opportunity to team up with Troon is a step in this direction, Foote explained. Through the collaboration, PointsBet will be able to connect with golfers and elevate their experience, as well as guarantee more visibility among fans.</p>
<p>The partnership was met with similar enthusiasm on Troon’s end. Chief development officer Scott Van Newkirk said that PointsBet helps drive innovative consumer experiences, and that is something that Troon fans will appreciate. He added:</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see our partnership with PointsBet grow as gaming opportunities increase across the country.” Chief development officer Scott Van Newkirk</p>
<p>PointsBet has been building up its portfolio in the United States steadily. The company has products up and running in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, and New Jersey and is happy to offer a flexible betting experience for fans. The company also managed to pull off a zero suspension rate of live markets, and it now hopes to integrate the feature on time for the next NFL season.</p>
<p>According to Notah Begay III, the company’s global golf ambassador and a prominent member of the PGA Tour, PointsBet’s forays into golf already have had a positive impact on the sport and have allowed it to grow to reach golfers in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>PointsBet was also granted a casino and sports betting license in Pennsylvania last week, expanding the company’s reach with yet another state. PointsBet has also entered into a college sports partnership with the University of Maryland.</p>
