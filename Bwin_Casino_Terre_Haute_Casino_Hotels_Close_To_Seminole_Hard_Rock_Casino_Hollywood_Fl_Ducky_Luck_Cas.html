<p>The Super Group-owned and leading global gaming and betting brand, Betway, announced it expanded its list of ambassadors. The company revealed it joined forces with the South African cricket legend, Graeme Smith. Under the terms of the new collaboration, announced last week, the former cricket international was designated as Betway's new Global Cricket Ambassador.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration isn't the first time Smith has teamed up with Betway. Between December 2019 and March 2022, he was Director of Cricket for Cricket South Africa, playing an important role in the creation of the Betway SA20, an exciting new tournament. Currently, Smith holds the role of League Commissioner for the tournament.</p>
<p>Despite retiring from cricket in 2014, the former cricket international continues to keep an eye on the sport. In fact, Smith often participates in interviews for the on-demand streaming service, Jio Cinema, where he appears as a pundit and commentator.</p>
<p>"I’m hugely excited to become Betway’s Global Cricket Ambassador," commented the new brand ambassador in a statement. Finally, Smith explained: "Betway are one of the biggest brands in global cricket and I’m really looking forward to be working with them to bring great content and insight to fans of the sport worldwide."</p>
<p>As one of the most recognizable faces in cricket, Smith became the youngest-ever captain for South Africa when he was only 22. Throughout his professional career, he accumulated 53 wins, designating him as the most successful Test captain.</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, Betway Group's CEO, shared his excitement about the latest appointment. "We’re immensely proud to have South African cricket legend Graeme Smith join the Betway Family," he explained. Werkman spoke about Smith's track record in sport, outlining that it is exciting to see him join Betway's growing roster of ambassadors.</p>
<p>Finally, Werkman pointed out: "Betway remains committed to being the number one betting brand within cricket as we continue to enhance the experience of the sport for fans around the world."</p>
<p>Currently, the leading global betting and gaming brand has many partnerships with leading sports leagues across the globe. Within soccer, Betway has active sponsorships in place with the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League. Additionally, the company has established deals with the NHL and NBA across the US and clinched sponsorships with tennis in eight countries across the globe.</p>
