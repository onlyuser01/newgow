<p>Hi David</p>
<p>From 1.4.2021 Casino Marriott has changed owners</p>
<p>And working today under a new owner.</p>
<p>you have a 1000 euro withdrawal request</p>
<p>And according to the terms and conditions, you are entitled to 150 euro</p>
<p>Your last deposit was 9/2/2021 of 15 euro</p>
<p>And under the terms, you are only entitled to 150 euros</p>
<p>Sent me your bank datils and I will transfer you the money</p>
<p>A very badly written email of which i certainly was not going to swallow. Here's my reply.. (minus my bank details)</p>

<p>Dear Casino Marriott.</p>
<p>On the 25th January of this year i made a deposit of €100 and a bonus was added. Between the day of making the deposit and up until Friday 29th January i had successfully wagered the necessary requirements of €13,500 (Although i had no idea of how you came about your wagering) If you actually add up the play through it was actually over €50k. Whilst speaking to two of your support staff between these dates they were informing me of the necessary wagering requirements to be played. I was informed that as soon as you have played through the requirements you will automatically be able to transfer over for a withdrawal. This took place on Friday 29th January. Because my initial deposit was €100 euro the limit that i could actually withdraw was €1000 (10 x the deposit) My balance actually increased to over €5,500 euros, but this was effectively dead money.</p>
<p>I made my withdrawal on the 29th January as i said earlier and this was locked into your system. All wagering had been completed and this was a 100% legitimate withdrawal. It's simple the €1000 euros was won with the €100 euro deposited on 25th January. I have screen grabs from your support staff confirming all of this. I have also attached the payment that left my bank. It was deposited to Marriott on Monday 25th March, and came through on my statement 3 days later.</p>
<p>In fact i was urged by your support staff to carry on depositing a couple of weeks later of which would speed up the processing and payment of my €1000 withdrawal?? Bizarre. Hence two further payments of €15 euros. These payments have NOTHING to do with my previous withdrawal.</p>
<p>You can also clearly see that one of your support staff has clearly told me that it has been accepted and paid! Incredible! I have many other screen grabs and emails from a former employee at the casino Mr Andrew Miller.</p>
<p>I've attached my bank details for which i expect you to make the right and honourable payment of €1000 euros.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is an oversight from the casino, and being new owners i'm sure you would want to keep the existing customers onboard and put things right after the incompetence of the last management, who actually breached everyone of your terms and conditions and also were acting with utter and Gross Negligence!</p>
<p>I look forward to the €1000 euro payment and this will ensure all legal action is cancelled.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely.</p>
