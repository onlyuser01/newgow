<p>John Hunter returns cracking a whip and braving ancient civilizations in pursuit of riches, fame and the satisfaction of completing another perilous adventure. Explore Pragmatic Play’s latest installment in the popular iGaming series with John Hunter and the Mayan Gods</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Inspires Fear in John Hunter with Mayan Gods</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play continues with its content push as 2020 draws closer to an end with another chapter in the John Hunter slot series. In the latest iteration, Pragmatic brings John Hunter face-to-face with the blood-thirsty Mayan gods of old in John Hunter and the Mayan Gods.</p>
<p>The franchise already offers an impressive variety of chapters in the series, including The Book of Tut, The Tomb of the Scarab Queen, Aztec Treasure and Da Vinci’s Treasure, to form a sizeable portfolio of adventure-inspired treasure hunt games.</p>
<p>In John Hunter and the Mayan Gods players experience a traditional 3-row and 5-payline slot, featuring the studio’s iconic explorer who has got himself in another pickle, making his way through the Latin American jungle in search of buried riches.</p>
<p>This Indiana Jones-inspired slot will offer consumers a shot at facing off fearsome gods and turning the Temple Scatter and Wild Symbols in their favor, lining the juicy payouts on Reels 2, 3 or 4.</p>
<p>A Well-Received Gaming Series with a New Twist</p>
<p>A winning combination with Wilds on these reels would lead to an Expanding Reel, for some additional benefits, it seems, and three or more Scatter Symbols will trigger the Free Spins mode. Better yet, you can enhance your winnings in the bonus spin level as you continue to add more Wild Symbols to the reels.</p>
<p>In fact, you stand to win the whopping 2,500 times their original stake, making for a worthwhile slot experience.</p>
<p>So, why the Mayans? Pragmatic’s Chief Business Development Officer, Yossi Barzely, believes that this is the next logical step for the character who has taken on many foes and unearthed legendary riches.</p>
<p>According to Barzely, the entire series has been well-received, and John Hunter and the Mayan Gods should be no different. The company’s currently committed to producing five high-quality slots on top of other operations across its Live Casino and Bingo verticals.</p>
<p>Bringing a Latin American spin to the series does make sense, after Pragmatic has signed so many successful partnerships in the region. The company struck a deal with Colombia’s Zamba for the company’s slot titles.</p>
<p>Recently, Pragmatic Play struck a live content partnership with Kindred followed by another one with Casumo for the company’s casino product portfolio.</p>
