<p>You are in safe hands We guarantee that all sites listed on GamblingNews.com are safe, legitimate, and secure operators that will help bring out the best possible iGaming experience. We will never knowingly promote unlicensed or blacklisted websites that operate against jurisdictional laws. Each brand we review is always manually co-verified by an online gambling expert. Legal and regulated</p>
<p>SSL-encrypted</p>
<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Betsafe is an international online sports betting operator with exposure in several multi-million markets. In today’s Betsafe Sports review, we will focus on everything you need to know about the brand. We will talk about available bonuses, cover the available betting options, sportsbook user interface, mobile compatibility, banking methods, and more.</p>
<p>With our help, you will be able to pinpoint everything there is to know about Betsafe whether this is to do with a specific sporting event, market variety, customer service, or any significant part of the experience.</p>
<p>As sports fans, you are very welcome to place your bet on the sports you like, but before you do, you may want to get yourself better acquainted with one of the best betting sites available to you. Read on to find out all you need to know about this sportsbook.</p>
<p>Betsafe Market Variety and Sports to Bet On</p>
<p>Betsafe has secured a rich variety of betting markets allowing fans to find a fitting pick to their taste. The website covers all big events and competitions, including but not limited to American football, tennis, basketball, ice hockey, baseball, tennis, motorsports, golf, virtual sports, and more. There are over 28 viable sports to bet on, with thousands of possible markets you can pick from.</p>
<p>In fact, every sport has a busy interface that is easily customizable when you click on the event that interests you the most. Players are able to select both the specific sport and market they want to place on and adjust the amount they are willing to bet through the intuitive Bet Slip.</p>
<p>The only shortcoming here is that the sportsbook doesn’t offer horse racing or dog racing, which could disappoint some sports bettors, but it’s perfectly fine. In fact, the betting site has come up with numerous ways to keep you entertained.</p>
<p>What Markets Can You Bet On?</p>
<p>The Bet Slip offers neat and quick functionality allowing you to adjust your bet size while displaying the odds and potential return. In terms of bet types, the sportsbook covers popular choices such as Moneyline, Point Spread and Totals, and leaves a lot of room for Accumulators and Parlays.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have a number of Proposition bets you can place and a single event can often have as many as +135 Prop bets running. This means 135 potential betting markets you can bet on a single NFL, NBA, La Liga, or Champions League game.</p>
<p>However, the number of betting options will vary depending on the sport and popularity, so keep this in mind. You can bet on the games Outright or wait for the In-play to start, with Betsafe usually covering the majority of popular events.</p>
<p>If you want to bet on future events, just click on Live &amp; Upcoming for a detailed list of what competitions are queued up for next week. The sportsbook will usually have a good variety of markets displayed, but some may take a little longer to adjust the odds for.</p>
<p>This happens when the sportsbook is still factoring in injuries, unpredicted events, or cancellations. Once the odds are available, though, they go up on the market without delay.</p>
<p>Live Betting Markets with Betsafe</p>
<p>Betsafe runs an extensive market coverage and the in-play sports betting section is one of its biggest pulls. Sports fans will have quite a few live betting events to pick from, adding to the excitement of sports betting. However, our job is to determine if the in-play markets are actually worth a shot, and they sure are. The betting site delivers a comprehensive selection of live markets and the underpinning technology to power the consumer experience.</p>
<p>‘In-play Betting’ is a separate dedicated section at the website and it is sufficiently busy. You can filter and sort through based on sports. Yet, the filter will allow you to quickly focus on the betting market you cherish the most, choosing from:</p>
<p>Match Winner</p>
<p>Match Goals</p>
<p>Both Teams to Score</p>
<p>Double Chance</p>
<p>3-way Handicap</p>
<p>This filter applies to soccer alone, but the filters evolve as you flick back and forth between different sports. All sports on Betsafe are available as an in-play market, but they usually won’t be available at the same time.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that Proposition markets tend to be fewer for live games, although we still saw some noteworthy live options, such as Italy’s Serie A football and NFL where the Props reached +115 and +90 respectively.</p>
<p>Placing an in-play bet is quick and easy, thanks to the platform, which makes each live bet a straightforward process. If you run into trouble, make sure to ping the support team.</p>
<p>Online Betting Limits: How High Can You Go?</p>
<p>Every sports betting site is free to determine what its betting limits should be. In the case of Betsafe, you can expect a high threshold per event, and benefit from some flexible betting ranges for others. Sports fans can bet as little as $0.10 per individual event and push this to $50,000 or more for an entire day. In some jurisdictions, you may be able to bet over $100,000* each week. In the meantime, events such as the Premier League and the Super Bowl will naturally come with more flexible betting limits.</p>
<p>For some of the higher bets you wish to place, you will most likely have to contact customer support and be subject to additional KYC and AML screening from the sportsbook. This is not bad news, as it adds to the level of protection and will help your peace of mind that should you win, your payout will be honored.</p>
<p>Mind the Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>*Sports fans should keep in mind that they may only withdraw $50,000 per week as per the current Terms and Conditions (T&amp;C’s). Betting limits will often change and vary across different jurisdictions. However, customer support will always be available to help you out with figuring out the specific limits in each country.</p>
<p>Betsafe Betting Features and User Interface</p>
<p>Betsafe packs a great user interface with even better sports betting features, designed to facilitate your experience with the website. The sportsbook has even taken the experience one step further by adding numerous features that aren’t as readily available at other betting sites. For example, you will have access to:</p>
<p>In-Play Betting</p>
<p>Starting Soon</p>
<p>Bet Builder</p>
<p>Statistics &amp; Live Score</p>
<p>Bet History</p>
<p>Settings</p>
<p>Navigation is then facilitated by other smart decisions for the user interface, such as Most Popular and Popular Competitions. Everything is intuitive enough and you can tap on sports and use the drop-down menu for additional screen space, whether you are using the desktop Betsafe sportsbook or have decided to go mobile. The ‘Bet Slip’ is located on the right-hand side keeping it safe from the rest of the options.</p>
<p>Betsafe Bonuses and Promotions</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on bonuses and promotions, Betsafe Sports makes sure that there are sufficient options to benefit from. We enjoy this sportsbook for the level of detail and care that has gone in crafting an actionable bonus section. Some promos will be limited, but upon a closer examination, we established that Betsafe extends a welcome bonus in every jurisdiction it operates in.</p>
<p>The website will mostly offer a 100% signup bonus to newcomers making for a cozy welcome. Still, the actual sports betting bonus terms may vary based on where you are accessing the website. Thankfully, all details are explained in each localization.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Betsafe will feature free spins to allow you to explore the casino as you register, but more importantly, there will be free bets to benefit from as well. Bonuses are very common and they are offered either through the promo section or extended to you as part of a marketing campaign via email.</p>
<p>Other interesting promotions include Early Payout and Your Safe Multipliers to have something to fall back on when choosing to bet Accumulators/Parlays.</p>
<p>Register and Verify Your Account</p>
<p>A true globe-trotter, Betsafe has quite some reach around the world. It has already been translated into nine languages and is subject to licensing laws in Malta, the United Kingdom, Norway, Poland, Kenya, and multiple other jurisdictions. Betsafe operates with considerable certainty in some of the most competitive markets, making the site accessible to players and sports fans from all over the place.</p>
<p>Registration is simple, quick, and easy. However, you still need to comply with each jurisdiction’s laws, which means that you will have to undergo quick KYC and AML checks. Once you do, you will be able to access the website’s banking options in full, making for swift cashouts. Different countries have their specificities which Betsafe will describe in detail.</p>
<p>Expect to be asked to submit your email, address, and date of birth as part of the information requested to verify players’ identity.</p>
<p>Betsafe Mobile App: Download and Play on the Go</p>
<p>If you choose to download the Betsafe mobile app, you will have access to powerful software that allows you to tap through online betting markets even quicker and places bets with ease. The app is available to both Android and iOS users but may be subject to local restrictions.</p>
<p>Places such as Kenya and the United Kingdom will mostly enjoy the app without any restrictions, though. You can still utilize promotions, bank, and contact customer service via the app, and it’s very easy to get started with the software. Just download it from Google or Apple Stores.</p>
<p>Betsafe Banking Methods: Deposit and Cashout Options</p>
<p>Banking methods are subject to individual jurisdictions, but you can generally expect the same banking conditions in each country you join Betsafe from. Deposits will usually command 0% fees and allow you to deposit at least $10. For withdrawals, you usually don’t have to pay any fees. There is a 24-hour pending period and the minimum withdrawable amount will vary between $10 and $20.</p>
<p>Overall, you will have payment options such as Visa, Interac, EcoPayz, Wire Transfers, Paysafecard, and others to complete deposits and withdrawals. All real money transfers must comply with AML checks, so prepare yourself. Banking will change slightly across different countries.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; Security with Betsafe Sports</p>
<p>Joining Betsafe you want to know that your money and financial information is safe. This is precisely what the sportsbook does. The company is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission, Spelinspektionen, and Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) to ensure the highest standard of consumer protection. Independently of its licensing, the website uses SSL encryption and remains committed to online and brick-and-mortar responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>If you need to get in touch with Betsafe, you have several ways of doing this. You can email, call on a landline or check live chat. Out of these, live chat tends to be the quickest ways to contact the customer care team, which is always there to help you</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Regardless of what jurisdiction you access Betsafe from, you will get started with a website that has a lot to offer. Live betting and sports market variety will be readily available. You will find yourself betting on hundreds of possible markets and choosing from the most competitive odds and betting opportunities. Our Betsafe Sports review couldn’t find any faults with the sportsbook, which enjoys the community’s own stamp of approval. Perhaps it will win you over, too.</p>
