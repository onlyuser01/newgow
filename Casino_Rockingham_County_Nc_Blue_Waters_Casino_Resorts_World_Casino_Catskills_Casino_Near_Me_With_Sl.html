<p>NetGaming, the up-and-coming online casino developer and supplier, has made another groundbreaking move in the world of digital assets and iGaming. The company has announced that it has joined the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, a first foray into the non-fungible or NFT world. NetGaming’s approach in the sector is two-pronged with the company also working on a dedicated NFT slot game that will be focused on the Mutant Ape theme.</p>
<p>NFT Games to Arrive in NetGaming’s Arsenal</p>
<p>Commenting on the company’s future plans, NetGaming.com CEO Pallavi Deshmukh explained in detail what the world can expect from her company’s entry into the sector. With the purchase of four rare MAYC NFTs which will now serve as the basis of the development of a unique game, NetGaming is happy to push innovation a step further. The four Mutant Ape Yacht Club tokens include #14988, #9054, #8978, and #2810 which are available to see on OpenSea.io, under the/NetGaming portfolio.</p>
<p>The slot game mentioned by Deshmukh has been in the pipeline for a while now. NetGaming has been working on an NFT-inspired slot game since August 2021, the chief executive confirmed in a statement. There have been revisions to the product to better tailor it to the expectations and needs of audiences and B2B clients.</p>
<p>Dubbed as the first “Mutant Ape-themed AAA standard slot game,” the forthcoming title is set to deliver on a new and electrifying experience that is powered through the non-fungible token technology. The slot release is scheduled for Q2 this year as the company is now in the process of recruiting the appropriate talent to ensure the longevity of the brand and boost its development capabilities.</p>
<p>The upcoming NFT slot is just the latest move undertaken by NetGaming to bring groundbreaking change to the iGaming industry and create fresh opportunities for players. NetGaming’s products are already available across the Pariplay and Relax Gaming distribution channels, making the company’s products available to hundreds of thousands of players.</p>
<p>Pushing the Boundaries of IGaming in the Past Two Years</p>
<p>NetGaming’s titles are also found across hundreds of iGaming brands and are available for consumers to explore in real-time. NetGaming was established in 2019 with the ambitious goal of expanding the limits of traditional iGaming. Since then, the company has been delivering 30 high-quality slot and table games and continues to embark on new projects.</p>
<p>The next big chapter in the company’s development will be focused on the NFT and crypto technology which will be baked into their upcoming release for the opportunity to introduce players to new experiences. Other prominent aggregators that have added the NetGaming portfolio include Slotegrator.</p>
