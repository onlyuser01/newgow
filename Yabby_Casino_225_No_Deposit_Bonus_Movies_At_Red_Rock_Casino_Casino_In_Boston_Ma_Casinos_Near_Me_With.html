<p>“It’s been an honor getting to know and work with her. We are excited to see Theresa continue succeeding in this new role,” Baldi explained. Birtalan attended Syracuse University and studied International Business. She has more than 25 years of experience working in and around the gaming industry and providing financial services and insurance.</p>
