    <h1>Embassy Suites By Hilton San Juan Hotel Casino Longhorn Casino Hotel Beste Online Casino The Casino</h1>

<p>WORST CASINO. MY ACCOUNT WAS FULLY VERIFIED AND MY WITHDRAW REQUESTS WERE REJECTED AFTER SUCCESSFUL APPROVAL. THEY ARE BIG SCAM CASINO. ALL AGENTS ARE JUST FOOLING YOU AND MAKE YOU DEPOSIT AND PLAY BY HOLDING YOUR PAYOUTS. Initially they told me verification isn't required to withdraw money. But, I had a doubt that to fool me they are false promising me. Then, I just forced to verify my account so that in future there should not be any problem to withdraw. I had uploaded all the required documents and they said my account was fully verified. I had deposited more than 20000 inr, one day I could win 18600 inr, I had placed 6600 and 12000 inr two different cashout requests. They approved them both and kept on hold almost for 5 days. I was also promised that they transfered to my account and my bank kept it on hold and asked my verify with my bank. When I checked with my bank they told me there is no any amount is on hold. After all that drama I could see my amount has reversed to my casino account..</p>
<p>All cheating happening everywhere when it comes to online casinos. They need your deposits but they never want to pay you.</p>
<p>All I want to request many players please don't look into these ratings and license about any casino. All that fake reviews and fake ratings.</p>
<p>Please deposit a little amount. Try withdrawing even if its a small amount. Test them if they pay it. If not please move away from that caino. I would suggest many players never trust any online casino. If you get your withdraw in your account then you are lucky enough to get your winnings. I have experienced with more than 20 casinos. Most of the casinos had looted my money. When it comes to payout they never paid me except one or two casinos.</p>
<p>Very big scam this online casino industry everyone is involved to fool players across the globe. All these ratings and reviews are just fake. Don't believe them.</p>
