    <h1>Eagle Pass Tx Casino Free Online Casinos Casino Carnival Downtown Grand Hotel And Casino Four Bears</h1>

<p>Kambi Group is proud to launch the first sportsbook in Nebraska and to power another market-first for one of its partners, CEO Nylén said</p>
<p>Kambi Group, a company describing itself as “the world’s most trusted sports betting partner,” has expanded its US footprint with a new Nebraska-oriented partnership. As announced by the supplier, it signed an on-property sportsbook partnership with Ho-Chunk’s WarHorse Gaming.</p>
<p>WarHorse Gaming, which is also a commercial entity under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska Racing Gaming Commission, will open the first sportsbook in Nebraska thanks to the deal with Kambi. In addition, the company will also launch WarHorse Casino in Lincoln in the following weeks. To top it off, the company plans to open another casino in Omaha next year.</p>
<p>As agreed, Kambi will establish a sportsbook at the WarHorse Lincoln Casino. The sports betting specialist will provide products that will complement the operator’s slot machines and thoroughbred racing offerings.</p>
<p>Kambi will power both WarHorse properties with its cutting-edge retail sports betting technology. The casinos will adopt the Kambi kiosks, Bring Your Own Device solution and the supplier’s famous Bet Builder product.</p>
<p>The new launch and the fact that Kambi will pioneer retail sports betting in the state attest to its leadership position in sports betting technology. The supplier is experienced in market-first launches and has robust regulatory experience in the USA and beyond. Because of that, many experts believe that Kambi is next in line for a potential M&amp;A deal.</p>
<p>Kambi Is Proud to Be First in Nebraska</p>
<p>The launch of the sportsbook at WarHorse’s Lincoln casino is a major development for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Lance Morgan, the chief executive officer of Ho-Chunk, commented on the matter, saying that WarHorse is thrilled to welcome Kambi as a partner. He noted that Kambi’s tech will nicely complement WarHorse’s casino offerings.</p>
<p>WarHorse is excited to partner with Kambi to launch Nebraska’s first sportsbook. Kambi’s industry-leading platform will enhance the gaming experience WarHorse offers for our guests. Lance Morgan, CEO, Ho-Chunk</p>
<p>Kristian Nylén, co-founder &amp; CEO of Kambi Group, also released a statement, saying that his team is delighted by the opportunity to power WarHorse Gaming with on-property sports betting solutions. Nylén noted that he is proud that his company will be launching the first sportsbook in the state.</p>
<p>As sports betting continues to expand across the US, we are proud to launch the first sportsbook in Nebraska and to power another market-first for one of our partners. Kristian Nylén, co-founder &amp; CEO, Kambi</p>
<p>In other news, Kambi recently deepened its sportsbook partnership with Paf – a company it has been working with for over a decade.</p>
