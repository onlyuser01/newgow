    <h1>Salt Creek Casino Lucky Club Casino Casino Arizona Hotel New Mexico Casino Resorts Best Online Casin</h1>

<p>I was informed that I bought bonus games with a value of 46 CHF zbspl. Nolimit / Mental. Whereby I mean less than € 5 per round as a maximum bet. Now I ask you to review the terms and conditions. What makes me puzzled is that messages appear via pop-up when the stakes are increased. Zbspl. Bonus games over 50 €, a popup window opens with the content "Maximum bet cannot be exceeded" This message is clear and sensible, but no message is made below this amount, I see this as unfair to consumers. Well, I could Resign myself to it if this is correct. I continued to play with my remaining balance that had no bonus attached and won again. Now another payout of € 800 is in the queue and again the Lucky Dream Casino is causing problems. My account has been verified ! I have proven this, 1x com Live Chat confirms this and another time from Finance Support. Now the casino says what my payout looks like when asked again: Unfortunately you are missing a document for the verification! This is a harassment towards customers The process of paying out / paying in always has to do with money, here you should trade professionally, unfortunately this is not at all here ht the case.</p>
<p>I hereby ask for official help</p>
<p>1 x value in dispute € 1900 (basis for negotiation)</p>
<p>The main prize does not apply to the game in which the limit was exceeded!</p>
<p>1 x acceleration of payment and rectification</p>
<p>Thank you very much !</p>
<p>I would be happy to send you the existing documents as evidence.</p>
<p>best regards</p>
