<p>The New York Giants (#6) vs Minnesota Vikings (#3) Wild Card game is taking place at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday afternoon</p>
<p>The New York Giants vs Minnesota Vikings game on Christmas Eve was one of the wildest duels of the regular season. It was 24-24 until the very final play of the game when Minnesotaâ€™s placekicker scored a 61-yard field goal, causing an eruption among fans at U.S. Bank Stadium.</p>
<p>The same venue is the location of the Giants vs Vikings Wild Card game this Sunday. Are we going to see another thriller? Oddsmakers suspect so as evident from the fact that theyâ€™ve set the spread to just three points.</p>

<p>Big Blue Putting Their Hopes in Danny Jones &amp; Saquon Barkley</p>
<p>Despite losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 18, the New York Giants got themselves a place in the playoffs. They finished the regular season with a 9-7 record, which was enough to get them the no. 6 seed in the NFC.</p>
<p>As a result, theyâ€™re now taking on the no. 3 team, the Minnesota Vikings on Wild Card Sunday. They might not have a great record against the Vikes â€“ four losses in the last four duels â€“ but their recent performances are giving them hope they could break the disappointing streak.</p>
<p>Daniel Jones is currently QB7 overall. He has done this with one of the most limited set of pass catchers in the league. 22 combined TDs, 4100 combined yards, and a 15-5 TD-INT ratio.</p>
<p>The Giants are 9-6-1 and playoff bound. Danny Dimes earned the ðŸ’°. pic.twitter.com/NgVE7y1BMc â€” TheOGfantasyfootball (@TheOGfantasy) January 4, 2023</p>
<p>New Yorkâ€™s offense has been fantastic lately, boosted by the top performances of their quarterback Daniel Jones. The 25-year-old completed over 70% of his passes in his previous two starts, throwing for three TDs along the way.</p>
<p>Running back Saquon Barkley was equally impressive and we expect him to do great on Sunday against a defense thatâ€™s allowed 138.7 yards on average in the last six weeks. He was the one who scored a TD late in the game in the Giants vs Vikings duel on Christmas Eve and we think he could do the same again.</p>
<p>The Vikes are Back Home</p>
<p>This is going to be the first Vikingsâ€™ playoff game at U.S. Bank Stadium since the Minneapolis Miracle in 2018. The game was bonkers, and we feel as if this one could prove crazy as well. After all, the Vikingsâ€™ games in the 2022-23 season were all super-interesting to watch.</p>

<p>These guys tend to score a lot, but also concede a lot of points. In their first game against the Giants, they had no turnovers, but we canâ€™t say weâ€™re 100% confident Kirk Cousins &amp; Co. wonâ€™t mess things up, at least in a couple of plays.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Vikes definitely do have the manpower to fight back. They have the experience and the motivation to do well in this game. We expect them to give their utmost both offensively and defensively, but will it be enough to advance to Divisional Playoffs?</p>
<p>New York Giants vs Minnesota Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings have been very unpredictable this season. One thing is certain when it comes to the Vikes, though â€“ these guys never give up.</p>
<p>That said, we do expect to see a very exciting game that wonâ€™t be decided until the very last moment. In fact, we think we could even see the game go to overtime.</p>
<p>Picks: Minnesota Vikings to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
