<p>VBet, a well-known global sport betting brand, has become the latest member to join the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). IBIA is a collation of sports betting companies and officials who are committed to eradicating corruption in sports. VBet is present in some of the most important betting markets in the world and Europe, including Great Britain, Malta, Sweden, and France, and it has been applying to expand its betting product elsewhere.</p>
<p>VBet Becomes Latest IBIA Partner</p>
<p>The company is a particularly important addition to IBIA’s lineup of trusted partners who will come together and try and eradicate sports fraud and related underhand activities. For starters, VBet was founded in 2003 and is known as a trusted and established international brand. The company is also in partnership with prominent figures from the world of sports, including Portsmouth and AS Monaco FC.</p>
<p>VBet will not just help deliver important insights into a betting activity that could be potentially tied to fraud, but also benefit from IBIA’s own integrity and monitoring tools that can let the bookmaker know when something untoward is taking place. VBet head of trading and sports Tigran Harutyunyan welcomed the opportunity and noted that the company was delighted to become a member of the integrity association.</p>
<p>“We offer markets on over 120 sports globally, so helping to maintain the integrity of the sporting events we offer to our customers is vital. The IBIA’s global reputation for dealing with sport integrity issues is unparalleled and this partnership underlines our commitment to providing our customers with the fairest offering possible.” VBet head of trading and sports Tigran Harutyunyan</p>
<p>IBIA is relying on operators’ input to establish deviation in betting patterns and alert partners as well as prompt investigation. The association has been actively looking to analyze suspicious betting patterns and use big data to ensure that corruption can be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Representation on High Level</p>
<p>IBIA is present at high-level discussions that aim to eliminate fraudulent practices and has representations and close ties with the International Olympic Committee, the European Commission, and the Council of Europe, among others.</p>
<p>IBIA has been actively reporting on fraudulent activities and alerting stakeholders as well as authorities. The company brought in Jean-François Reymond to bolster its efforts in ensuring the safety of the sport. IBIA previously partnered with ComeOn Group to reach even more audiences and have better tracking across thousands of sporting events.</p>
