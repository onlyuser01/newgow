<p>DraftKings, a US-based sports betting giant with a global reach, has become the latest industry company to respond by condemning the decision of the US Supreme Court to overturn the Roe vs Wade decision which effectively prohibited individual states from banning abortions en masse. With the decision overturned, though, many conservative states across the United States are expected to begin passing quick laws that make abortions illegal and people who facilitate or try to have abortions subject to serious criminal penalties.</p>
<p>Overturning Abortion Decision Endangers Employees</p>
<p>These laws are often being planned in a hurry and without consideration for womenâ€™s well-being. This is why DraftKings announced an expanded package of health benefits to the tune of $10,000. The company is willing to reimburse travel expenses to its employees and their dependents up to the stated sum. DraftKings is joining many big businesses, including Meta and Disney, to have done so. The company delivered a LinkedIn statement that outlined the decision:</p>
<p>At DraftKings, the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. DraftKings LinkedIn statement</p>
<p>Reverting the constitutional right of abortion is not something DraftKings is going to sit idly by and watch, the company stated. This is why the package is passed in order to help employees who are in states where abortions are banned or may be banned in the future, putting lives at risk.</p>
<p>Politicians Express Their Opinions about the Decision</p>
<p>A number of conservative justices at the Supreme Court showed no deliberation, with Brett Kavanaugh, the controversial former US President Donald Trump appointee, being accused of lying by leftwing politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
<p>Ocasio-Cortez said that Kavanaugh signaled that he would not move ahead and back a ban on abortions during the hearings that led to his position at SCOTUS. To Ocasio-Cortez, this is easily an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom said that the state would not change anything about its abortion rules and that the right to abort will remain legal in the state.</p>
<p>The polarizing issue will cost both sides, as sports fans and gamblers are as much coming from liberal backgrounds as they do from more conservative ones. DraftKings, though, has chosen to be on the right side of history.</p>
