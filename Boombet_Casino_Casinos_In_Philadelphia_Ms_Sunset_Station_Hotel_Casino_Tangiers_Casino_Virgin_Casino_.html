    <h1>Boombet Casino Casinos In Philadelphia Ms Sunset Station Hotel Casino Tangiers Casino Virgin Casino</h1>

<p>BGaming, an acclaimed supplier and developer of innovative content for the online casino sector, has teamed up with Maxbet, a Serbian operator, expanding the reach of its portfolio of games in the market and the region.</p>
<p>Maxbet is a carefully picked partner which has more than 30 years of experience running iGaming and sports betting divisions. As to BGaming, the company is bringing more than 100 intuitive and modern games that will resonate with players in not just Serbia, but also Maxbet’s audiences in North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia.</p>
<p>Maxbet is an important regional player as reflected by Flutter Entertainment’s recent acquisition of a majority stake in the operator in September, with the company agreeing to pay £123m for the transaction. Moving forward, Maxbet players will have access to such popular BGaming options as Bone Bonanza, Elvis Frog, Gemhalla, and more.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Maxbet Head of Online Casino Vukašin Marelj said that the operator was very happy to see BGaming joining in. Marelj noted that BGaming was a supplier that brought many different games, mechanics, and genres, including Bonus Buy, Megaways and crash games.</p>
<p>As to BGaming, the company’s CCO, Olga Levshina, was similarly pleased with the opportunity to expand its reach in Eastern Europe and with what is clearly a prominent local operator. "Our new content deal with Maxbet could not have come at a better time, as the top operator continues to follow an impressive growth trajectory," Levshina assured.</p>
<p>She also said that BGaming is bound to resonate with Maxbet’s players and provide them with some exciting gamification options moving forward. BGaming has been rapidly expanding, as noted by Levshina in an interview during SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>The company has been able to move its product across borders and continents with ease, negotiating important localized partnerships that focus on promising and fast-developing markets. Among the recent tie-ups the supplier has inked are partnerships with NetBet in Italy and Betara in Peru.</p>
