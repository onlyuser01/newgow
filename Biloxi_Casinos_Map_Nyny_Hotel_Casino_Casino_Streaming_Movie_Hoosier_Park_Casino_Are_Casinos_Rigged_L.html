    <h1>Biloxi Casinos Map Nyny Hotel Casino Casino Streaming Movie Hoosier Park Casino Are Casinos Rigged L</h1>

<p>I received a welcome invitation, offering $100 free bonus. I reached the play, threw them out at which time the casino automatically remove the remaining balance and put the next withdraw amount into my account which total $50.</p>
<p>That point I attempted to make a withdrawal but I was blocked by the website program and informed that I must fill out a player verification form and submit it. The page that the prompt from the cashiers page, navigate me to was only designed in capable of accepting my identification documents, which I uploaded and submitted 9 days ago now. Casino informed me this will be a 3 to 5 day process and I would be able to withdraw that $50. There was never any clarification on this form that I’ve asked about multiple times, and the question has never been addressed another question I asked was about depositing in the Casino would I be able to play with that money but not the bonus winnings any further, this portrait chat representative, informed me, I could indeed deposit money and play but if I played that $50 down beyond $50 that I wouldn’t be able to withdraw that $50!so I waited a few days, three to be exact and checked back in see where exactly the casino was with the KYC process, the cashier at that point responded quite quickly, and informed me that I needed to resend a selfie holding my identification. I promptly obliged and submitted the selfie. Three more days went by and I can return to the casino to check and see where they were out on the KYC process. It appeared that no progress had been made at that point, so I inquired as to what the holdup might be. I was informed by the cashier that they would not process my KYC application UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT I HAD MADE A WITHDRAWAL REQUEST IN MY ACCOUNT. It turns out that processing request for withdraw is a Prequisite for initiating the KYC process. However, it is also a pre-requisite that prior to processing a withdrawal request KYC must be completed. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD. I’VE SOUGHT CLARIFICATION ON THIS. AND TO NO AVAIL I HAVE REQUESTED CLARIFICATION FROM BOTH THE SUPPORT ONLINE CHAT PORTAL AS WELL AS THE CASHIER PORTAL. MY QUESTION CONTINUES TO GO ON, ANSWERED. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD THE ANSWER, WELL, PERHAPS NOT THE ANSWER BUT A SOLUTION, SO I DID what I thought would work. WHAT I DID WAS MADE A $30 LIGHT COIN DEPOSIT INTO MY ACCOUNT. INITIALLY THE DEPOSIT APPEARED IN MY ACCOUNT AS A PENDING DEPOSIT. THEN 15 MINUTES LATER THAT PENDING DEPOSIT DISAPPEARED. I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF IT CENTS. I SUPPLIED LIMITLESS CASINO, THE LITECOIN TRANSACTION NUMBER THE TRANSACTION DATA FROM THE BLOCK CHAIR HAVE INQUIRED ABOUT THIS DEPOSIT MULTIPLE TIMES, THE QUESTION JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER QUESTION I HAVE CONTINUES TO LINGER AND GO ON ANSWERED. WHEN I MAKE INQUIRIES WITH THE ONLINE CHAT SUPPORT PORTAL, I AM INFORMED THAT I NEED TO CONTACT THE CASHIER EVERYTHING ON THE CASHIERS PAGE POINTS TO ALL QUESTIONS BE DIRECTED TO THE ONLINE SUPPORT CHAT PORTAL , SO HERE I AM INTO THIS NINE DAYS. I WAS INFORMED YESTERDAY THAT THE KEYC PROCESS HAS NOT EVEN BEGAN. I COMMENTED THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO PROCESS A REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL, AND AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT THE CASHIER. ABOUT FIVE HOURS AGO I once again contacted support through the online chat portal, inquired about my deposit, inquired about the KYC PROCESS, INQUIRED ABOUT THIS MYSTERIOUS FORM THAT I’M SUPPOSED TO FILL OUT AND SUBMIT, AND ONCE AGAIN, I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT THE CASHIER AND ALL SIGNS FROM THE CASHIER LEAD ME RIGHT BACK TO THE ONLINE SUPPORT PORTAL. It’s a very vicious cycle with no end in sight. This is absolutely the worst online casino experience I have ever had. They make commitments, time commitments they do not keep, and I have every reason to believe that they know all too well, going into it that the times that they "will not be met. They avoid answering simple questions questions that deserve answers. One department direction to the other department and that department directions back to that same department, it is my opinion and I have every reason to believe this is true. Their only concern is to get you off of there screen and move you to someone else’s and when you arrive there, they want to do the same thing. The last message I received from them in the online chat portal was in response to a copy of an email, which is an automated email response from the cashier that I sent to them and it states clearly that the KYC PROCESS WILL NOT COMMENCE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A WITHDRAWAL, REQUEST IS MADE FROM THE PLAYERS ACCOUNT PAGE. I SENT THEM THAT EMAIL AND A COPY OF THE ACCOUNT PAGE THAT IS BLOCKING ME FROM PROCESSING THAT WITHDRAWAL REQUEST. THEIR RESPONSE ONCE AGAIN, WE DO NOT HANDLE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE KYC PROCESS, ANYTHING TO DO WITH DEPOSITS, OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH WITHDRAWALS. That begs the question then just what the hell do they do? I would like help getting my money as it currently stands I don’t see that ever happening.</p>
