<p>Dear tantturai,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the Responsible Gaming section, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Self-Exclusion</p>
<p>You may choose to exclude yourself from our site for a longer period of time, including an unlimited exclusion.</p>
<p>Once the Self-Exclusion period ends, your account will automatically be reactivated and you will then be able to access your account. You may request for a Self-Exclusion to be removed prior to it’s expiry, however the 7 day cooling-off period will apply. The account will be re-activated on the original expiry date or after the 7 day cooling off period, whichever is the earliest.</p>
<p>If you do exclude yourself from our site, you will be removed from all marketing communications for the period that you are excluded. (Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for all our marketing databases to be updated.) To exclude yourself from our site, please click here.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you informed this specific casino about your gambling problem? Please understand that if you self-exclude yourself from one casino it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are protected on all the other associated websites.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
