    <h1>Best Online Casino Bonuses Prairie Knights Casino And Resort Riverside Resort And Casino Sandia Reso</h1>

<p>I emailed them to have my account blocked in march as I had a problem gambling as a result of my addiction I tried to log in a few weeks later I was logged in straight away and able to deposit over €1000 i contacted them via chat to ask why my account was not blocked they said at first I created another account and that they didn't know which one to block and this is why my account wasn't blocked, then they said it was because I didn't state I had a problem gambling in the email as I said I stated in live chat I had a problem gambling yet they were willing to keep my account open and kept mentioning I would loose all bonuses as I had cashback, I believe they breach there responsibility gambling terms and conditions which resulted in me loosing money that i could not afford to spend i do acknowledge i have to take some responsibility as I deposited but as stated in there terms and conditions they have measures to keep players safe which they did not do for me, also I have been with this casino since December 2021 and my biggest win has been €100 in live casino and €80 on slots, there are many better casinos out there with a lot more to offer but I had self excluded from and never been able to access again unfortunately this one I could and due to my addiction I could not help play there as I could not access any others because there self exclusion actually works, just to add they do not have limit options only self exclusion which as I stated previously did not even stop access to my account STAY AWAY</p>
