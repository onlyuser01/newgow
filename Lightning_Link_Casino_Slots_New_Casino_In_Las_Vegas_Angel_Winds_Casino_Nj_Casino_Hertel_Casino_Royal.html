    <h1>Lightning Link Casino Slots New Casino In Las Vegas Angel Winds Casino Nj Casino Hertel Casino Royal</h1>

<p>Please read my massage:</p>
<p>I played in Royal Panda as absolutely legitimate player with all verified documents.</p>
<p>I deposited total amount of $3,000 to Royal Panda and after playing slots I won $8,500. Please note that you kindly accepted all my deposits. After that I uploaded all my documents including:</p>
<p>1) My Passport</p>
<p>2) My bank statement</p>
<p>3) впиши</p>
<p>And you successfully verified ALL of them.</p>
<p>After that I requested withdrawal of $8,500 and PROBLEMS START TO APPEAR. First of all I was patiently waiting for one week for my withdrawal. After multiple chats with you and discussions by email you were able to give me some answer.</p>
<p>Please note that all this time all required documents are VERIFIED.</p>
<p>After all these time me waiting you had good imagination to ask from me... (Please listen carefully) the explanation of internal transaction from my bank statement which is ABSOLUTELY NOT RELATED to Royal Panda!This is absurd. I explained you via chat, email and also</p>
<p>I called to Royal Panda many time to explain that this my internal transaction, which is actually made to me from my ex-husband with whom we are in the divorce process... and you don’t care.</p>
<p>For me it was incredibly hard to explain my ex-husband to give me his bank statement. I was asking for weeks. After weeks of asking he finally gave me his bank statement showing wire transfer to my account which you for some reason was interested in. I gave it you and you AGAIN successfully verified this statement. Finally I was hoping to receive my money but no.. now my account is blocked for some reason you can’t explain...</p>
