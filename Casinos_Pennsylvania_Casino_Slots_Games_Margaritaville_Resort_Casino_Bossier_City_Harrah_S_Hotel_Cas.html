<p>Super Group, one of the most prominent gaming companies in the industry, has revealed plans to sell some of its non-core B2B assets to Games Global. The news was published on Games Global’s website, outlining the company’s determination to acquire Digital Gaming Corporation's B2B arm, a surprise sale in light of Super Group’s recent accusation of the asset in January.</p>
<p>Games Global, though, has been very happy with the developments, hailing the opportunity as one that will significantly strengthen its presence in the regulated market in the United States. Games Global recently bought a number of assets from Microgaming, including the company’s distribution arm and online games portfolio.</p>
<p>The latest acquisition will further strengthen Games Global’s presence in the United States as noted, as the company will gain access to a number of markets – or strengthen its presence at the very least. Digital Gaming Corporation is considered a leading supplier of content for the online casino market, and also the operator of Betway, a betting and gaming brand that is now well-established in the North American market, and the United States.</p>
<p>Regulatory approvals are still to be awarded, but should all go according to plan, Games Global is expecting to finalize the purchase in the second half of 2023. Meanwhile, Digital Gaming Corporation is licensed to provide products for the vibrant online gaming sector in states such as Michigan, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As a company based in the United States, and with offices in Florida and New Jersey, Digital Gaming Corporation is perfectly positioned to continue driving strong forays in the local market. Games Global CEO Walter Bugno was among the first to welcome this new opportunity.</p>
<p>"The acquisition of DGC B2B is an extremely exciting opportunity, accelerating Games Global’s entry into the rapidly growing US iGaming market," the executive said. He described the partnership as a positive move that will enable Games Global to gain access to a robust platform and leverage its own portfolio of more than 50 partner studios along with 3,000 proprietary games.</p>
<p>Super Group CEO Neal Menashe was similarly pleased with the development and said that it made strategic sense for the group to push on with this decision. It was part of Super Group’s broader strategy to focus solely on the B2C segment and growth in the United States while transferring its non-core B2B division to the capable hands of Games Global instead.</p>
