<p>Vikings Fortune review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Viking’s Fortune takes you across the North Sea to a Viking settlement on the Danish coast. The setting is the wild North and the characters that populate the slot range from Odin’s raven to Loki’s wolf with a few blonde haired and blue eyed Scandies inbetween.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are as well drawn as you would expect from Playson, but with the added bonus of feeling alive and part of a unique world.</p>
<p>The music is a reasonably innocuous track with a pleasant early-medieval tone that sets the scene beautifully and does not get on the players nerves too quickly.</p>
<p>The animations are simple but work well. On the whole this is a well designed slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Viking’s Fortune is a five reel slot, with three rows, and twenty-five win lines.</p>
<p>There are also two bonuses: Free Spins and the Bonus Game (details below). There are also three progressive jackpots which can be triggered through the Bonus Game.</p>
<p>This is plenty of features to keep a distractible player engaged.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter and Bonus symbols, and pays out the same as the highest value symbol for three or more on a win line.</p>
<p>The Scatter appears only on reels one, three, and five. If you hit one symbol on each of these reels, you win five times your bet and trigger the Free Spins game.</p>
<p>The Free Spins bonus starts with eight free spins. During the Free Spins, the high value and Bonus symbols can appear as large 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 "Colossal" symbols.</p>
<p>Hitting at least 5 bonus symbols award the Bonus Game</p>
<p>Not only can the Free Spins bonus be retriggered if you hit three or more Scatters during the Free Spins, but you can also trigger the Bonus Game bonus. If this happens, you play out the retriggered free spins or Bonus Game and then return to the initial Free Spins bonus.</p>
<p>Bonus symbols have a value on them of between x1 and x24 your bet per spin. If you hit five or more Bonus symbols anywhere on the reels during one spin, then the Bonus Game will be triggered. The Bonus symbols from the triggering spin will log in place and a spin counter will be set at three spins.</p>
<p>Last respin in the Bonus Game feature</p>
<p>During the Bonus Game all Bonus symbols are locked in place from spin to spin. Hitting a new Bonus symbol on a spin resets the spin counter to three. When the counter reaches zero, the value on all the Bonus symbols are added up and the player wins that amount.</p>
<p>The Bonus Game can also trigger one of the three progressive jackpots: the Mini, Major or Grand jackpots.</p>
<p>The Mini and Major jackpots are triggered if the Mini or Major Bonus symbol lands during the Bonus Game. The Grand Jackpot is triggered if during a Bonus Game the player fills all fifteen cells on the reels.</p>
<p>Paytable for standard symbols</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.20%. We tend to use 96% as a rough yardstick, and this slot falls well below that.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a terrible match for our preferred slot machine strategies which tend to rely on the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for special symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>From a promising start of theme, character and gameplay, Viking’s Fortune falls at a few key landing grounds.</p>
<p>The first is the low return to player, that might ensure the Viking’s Fortune but means the game will raid players' wallets far faster than we like. In addition to this, the low volatility secures this game’s place on the "do not recommend" list.</p>
