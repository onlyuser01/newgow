<p>This Year’s Races Were Full of Excitement</p>
<p>Flutter Entertainment, the parent company of renowned brands such as Paddy Power, Betfair, and Sky Bet, has cause for celebration as it reported an impressive 22 million bets during the highly anticipated Royal Ascot event.

Surprise after surprise kept the audience at their seats, and bettors engaged throughout. The event’s unique blend of glamor, sporting excellence, and the chance to witness legendary horses competing for glory captured the imagination of horse-racing enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
