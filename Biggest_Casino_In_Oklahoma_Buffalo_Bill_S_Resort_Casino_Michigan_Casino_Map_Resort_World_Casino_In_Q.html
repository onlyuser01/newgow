<p>PandaScore has signed a partnership with FortuneJack, an established crypto-focused gaming operator which offers both iGaming and betting products. PandaScore is now going to bolster the operator’s esports betting offering, across ten titles, including Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Valorant, League of Legends, and Call of Duty to name a few.</p>
<p>FortuneJack Breaks into Esports Space</p>
<p>These esports games constitute some of the most bet-on titles there are, and FortuneJack is readily expanding into the competitive gaming betting segment. As a result of the tie-up, the operator will have access to a wide range of pre-match and in-play markets, which are delivered by an industry specialist.</p>
<p>PandaScore has established a strong foothold in the esports betting space through the delivery of state-of-the-art products. FortuneJack represents one of the oldest crypto casinos in the industry along with other trusted options such as Cloudbet and Sportsbet.io.</p>
<p>PandaScore CEO Flavien Guillocheau welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with FortuneJack. He praised the casino as one of the most innovative gambling operators out there and said that he and the team were thrilled to be working alongside them.</p>
<p>“Our partnership will allow FortuneJack to expand its presence in the esports market, offering more lines and varied odds than ever before, in both pre-match and in-play markets for all the major esports titles.”</p>
<p>As Guillocheau noted earlier this year, esports is experiencing real growth. FortuneJack’s boss, Boris Kiknadze, responded in kind and welcomed PandaScore’s expertise. He commended PandaScore as a frontrunner in esports betting markets and welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with it.</p>
<p>Esports Growth Steady</p>
<p>“This is definitely an amazing partnership for both parties and we look forward to utilizing the company’s unrivaled range of markets,” Kiknadze said. The future of esports in betting looks promising, not least in the words of Oliver Niner, heads of sales at PandaScore with whom we conversed previously on the GamblingNews podcast.</p>
<p>This is not PandaScore first successful collaboration with a gambling operator either. In July, the company teamed up with Loot.Bet to boost its offering of esports odds and fixtures. More good news for esports betting is coming from New Jersey, US, where esports has been recognized as an acceptable vertical in the gambling market.</p>
