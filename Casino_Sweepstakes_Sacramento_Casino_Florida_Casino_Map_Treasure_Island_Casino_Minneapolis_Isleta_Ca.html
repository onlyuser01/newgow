<p>The Brussels-based trade association representing online gambling operators, the European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), released its latest sustainability report. Announced on Thursday, the new report highlights achievements within strategic objectives, including the promotion of safer gambling, as well as progress in areas like employment, diversity, energy and environment.</p>
<p>EGBA's latest report reveals a 20% year-over-year increase in the promotion of safer gambling. Last year, EGBA members helped distribute 45.5m messages that promoted safer gambling. From that total, 21.7m messages were personalized, marking a 42% year-over-year increase in personalized messages. The recent report reveals that while in 2021, the share of personalized messages was 40%, last year, it increased to 48%, outlining the importance of such communications.</p>
<p>Judging by the recent report, contributions to problem gambling research, education and treatment (RET) for the European region soared in 2022. Such contributions hit €49m, representing growth of 109% year-over-year. Additionally, the donations to different community programs and charities in Europe increased by 5% year-over-year to €127m.</p>
<p>Highlighting the importance of responsible gambling tools, EGBA's new report revealed data regarding the use of such tools. It said that 18.4m customers used at least one safer gambling tool. This otherwise means that some 60% of the customers are using safer gambling tools, while 30% started using safer gambling tools voluntarily. The most popular responsible gambling tool proved to be the deposit limit, given that 67% of the customers used it.</p>
<p>When it comes to employment and diversity, EGBA's latest report reveals that the number of employees of its members within online and land-based gambling increased by 11% year-over-year, hitting 63,386 employees. A breakdown shows that the majority of the employees were male, or some 57%, while the remaining 43% were female.</p>
<p>Maarten Haijer, EGBA's Secretary General, shared his excitement about the latest report in a statement received via email. "We’re delighted that our members continue to make positive progress in their efforts to promote safer gambling. This is all part of their commitment to put a sustainable approach to gambling at the heart of what they do," he explained.</p>
<p>Additionally, Haijer pointed out: "The contribution of our CEOs in this report demonstrates their personal and crucial commitment to the collective sustainability drive of the association." Speaking about the latest report, he said that EGBA is pleased with the latest results, outlining progress in strategic areas, including employment and diversity, as well as energy and environmental performance.</p>
