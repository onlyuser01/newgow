<p>Dear msysak89,</p>
<p>I'm Michal, and I have taken over your complaint. I have reviewed your case, and just so you know, every bonus can have its own specific conditions, so we always encourage players to read and understand the bonus T&amp;Cs before they activate or claim any bonus. Do I understand correctly that you lost your deposit and the bonus funds while wagering the bonus? You mentioned that you had no cash left, so am I right in assuming that you accumulated your winnings solely from the free spins? The winnings from bonus free spins are usually limited as well. The casino has this mentioned in the bonus T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>1.3. The maximum allowed amount for withdrawal that has been won from casino bonus free spins is €100. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the allowed amount, the player will receive €100 and the rest will be charged to players in accordance with the bonus policy.</p>
<p>I will still contact the casino to shed more light on this matter.</p>
<p>We would like to invite Snatch Casino to join the conversation.</p>
<p>Dear Snatch Casino,</p>
<p>Can you please information on why were the player's winnings capped? Once the player has met the wagering requirements for the free spins and has received "real money" in their balance, subsequent gameplay and winnings should no longer be subject to bonus terms and conditions.</p>
