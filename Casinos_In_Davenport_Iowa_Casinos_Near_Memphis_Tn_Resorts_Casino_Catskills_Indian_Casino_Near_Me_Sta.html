<p>LeoVegas has invested €1.1 million for a 25% stake into SharedPlay, a new startup that allows players to share their gaming experiences online.</p>
<p>Potential Future Ownership Expansion</p>
<p>LeoVegas has acquired a 25% equity in SharedPlay, a gambling startup that enables users to share their online gaming experiences with each other. LeoVegas has invested €1.1 million in SharedPlay through LeoVentures, its investment branch, with a potential expansion of its stake in the future if certain requirements are fulfilled.</p>
<p>SharedPlay’s offerings include the gambling market’s first online multiplayer casino game solution. Other types of entertainment, such as video games, music, and movie, have long inspired people to share and follow one another’s experiences digitally, and this phenomenon is now catching on in the gaming and casino industries as well.</p>
<p>SharedPlay aims to turn lone play sessions into fun multiplayer experiences, as being a member of a virtual network while gaming helps players to share their gaming sessions online.</p>
<p>Perfect Match for LeoVegas and SharedPlay</p>
<p>There is a new behavior in the gaming industry, and many other digital customer segments, which is about sharing the thrill of gaming with friends, including with those who share similar interests, Gustaf Hagman, Group CEO of LeoVegas, noted. The SharedPlay team is “world-class“, he added, and the business is in a great place to lead the next evolution of the social gambling experience.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2020, SharedPlay is led by Karolina Pelc, one of the most well-known figures in the field of casino innovation and product development. The business was established to expand on the possibilities that occur in emerging trends in an increasingly growing industry, SharedPlay’s founder and CEO declared. “I have closely followed the development of social platforms, how we consume moving pictures, and how it has become part of the gaming industry,” Pelc said.</p>
<p>SharedPlay’s mission is to build the best and most compelling product to get casino games to become more social. The deep loyalty that exists among the new generation of gambling players combined with a healthy and comfortable online experience, has enormous potential, Pelc stated. LeoVegas is a “dream partner” because they are “passionate about the gaming experience and innovation in product development“, and they have proven their ability to drive growth and generate value through their other investments.</p>
