<p>William Hill outlined its plans for further development by focusing on growing revenue through improving its operational efficiency and utilizing economies of scale, supported by a highly competitive customer service complemented by the introduction of an agile team.</p>
<p>Technology Innovation</p>
<p>After revealing its 2019 financial results yesterday, William Hill explained its strategy built around continuous innovation as the means of providing the competitive customer offering, and raising up the bar in the standard of customer support through a personalized approach.</p>
<p>Client Satisfaction</p>
<p>Customer service will be at the core of the matter as the company stresses on providing the very basics of the gambling operations such as deposits and withdrawals, registration and login, bet settlement and others, in an impeccable manner and with faster response times to customer queries and complaints.</p>
<p>Safer Gambling</p>
<p>Focus on safer gambling is also being highlighted, with a number of 2019 developments in this direction already taking place, among which increasing the number of clients who set their own deposit limit by 50%, across different jurisdictions and in a period of regulatory changes.</p>
<p>William Hill, along with other tier 1 gambling companies, agreed to an increase to 1% of its gross gaming revenue to go towards funding in safer gambling research, education and treatment, to be achieved by 2023, on top of the already voluntarily implemented whistle-to-whistle advertising ban during live sports events, that has led to a 97% reduction of adverts for betting being seen by children.</p>
<p>Structural Changes</p>
<p>To complement the commitment to customers, William Hill is introducing a number of executive changes, too, with a new chief product and technology officer role, Satty Bhens being appointed last year, and a new chief operating officer role, fulfilled on an interim basis by Philip Le Feuvre, looking for consolidation of business support operations into a single client-centric function.</p>
<p>Platform Utilization</p>
<p>Using its core platform components and processes such as the Global Trading Platform and Smart Data Platform across its different divisions and international jurisdictions, William Hill is counting on utilizing economies of scale and improving its efficiency operations-wise.</p>
<p>UK Market</p>
<p>Across different jurisdictions, the global gambling operator is facing different types of challenges and perspectives, as expectations for profits in the UK continue to deteriorate due to the tightening regulation, imposed stake limit and uncertainty due to possible future revisions of the Gambling Act 2005.</p>
<p>European Perspectives</p>
<p>In the other European markets, William Hill is focusing on growth acceleration in the Nordic region, specifically Sweden and Denmark, by developing its own offering in the former and improving it in the latter, as well as expanding the presence of the company in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Focus On US Expansion</p>
<p>In the U.S., where the company is taking one in every four bets, William Hill will continue to rely upon its ongoing technology revamp to present innovative ideas around in-play sports betting, on top of greater returns from investment in marketing, to gain a competitive edge, and partnership deals to expand into newly regulated states.</p>
