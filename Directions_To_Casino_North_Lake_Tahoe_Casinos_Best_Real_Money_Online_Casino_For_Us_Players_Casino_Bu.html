<p>The global gaming company, International Gaming Technology (IGT), announced a 10-year contract extension with the Kansas Lottery earlier this week. The company said Wednesday that its subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, extended its collaboration with the lottery in Kansas.</p>
<p>As a result, the deal between the duo will run through December 14, 2032. Under the extended contract, the Kansas Lottery will gain access to an IGT's enhanced version of INTELLIGEN, an electronic gaming central system.</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT's chief operating officer of global lottery, said in a statement released on June 1, 2022: "IGT's upgraded INTELLIGEN system will provide the Kansas Lottery with a suite of comprehensive tools designed to drive revenues and offer its players world-class gaming experiences."</p>
<p>He explained that thanks to the enhanced INTELLIGEN system, the Kansas Lottery will better manage its network. Moreover, Gendron acknowledged that the system will increase the Lottery's efficiency, enhance its functionalities and help it grow further.</p>
<p>The Kansas Lottery will benefit from the extended contract by gaining access to the solution which will also improve the gaming experience for the players. Additionally, the lottery will leverage advanced business intelligence tools. Those tools will boost productivity by easing the lottery's day-to-day operations. Last but not least, the recent deal will see Kansas Lottery access IGT's instant ticket games as well as printing services.</p>
<p>IGT's INTELLIGEN product has already proved its reliability around the world. Currently, the product helps connect different gaming environments with a variety of gaming machines. The innovative solution continues to improve, considering IGT's nearly three decades of experience within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Late last month, IGT announced a key collaboration with Harrington Raceway and Casino. The company revealed that it inked a multi-product systems technology agreement with the Delaware casino. The collaboration would allow the venue to benefit from gaming floor optimization and exciting experiences for its players thanks to IGT's leading solutions.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, the company announced the launch of its highly-popular Money Mania Wide Area Progressive (WAP) video slots game for commercial gaming jurisdictions. The launch follows a successful launch of the video slots game for tribal gaming operators. This resulted in IGT's latest game entering New Jersey and Nevada, which are among the key gaming markets in the US.</p>
<p>As a global leader within the gaming industry, IGT continues to expand its presence by joining forces with leading operators. At the same time, the company supports responsible gambling and seeks to offer the players innovative experiences. By now, IGT has a presence in more than 100 jurisdictions globally and its portfolio of customers is continuously growing.</p>
