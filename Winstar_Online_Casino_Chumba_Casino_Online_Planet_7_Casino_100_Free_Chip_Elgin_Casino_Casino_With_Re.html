<p>Scientific Games and BetSwap Limited, the first fully integrated online secondary marketplace for sportsbooks, have agreed to collaborate. The BetSwap platform allows bettors to buy and sell active betslips with other bettors on their preferred sportsbook before or after a match, as long as a result hasn’t been decided.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Partners with BetSwap Limited</p>
<p>Online sportsbook businesses may use the BetSwap plug-in platform to build a fully integrated online secondary marketplace. Sportsbooks will engage their bettors in new ways by incorporating the BetSwap app, which includes marketplace and social elements for buying and selling betslips.</p>
<p>The incorporation into OpenArena allows sportsbooks to use the BetSwap platform to complements the standard cash-out functionality. The addition of this peer-to-peer marketplace to the OpenArena platform enhances the platform’s offering, giving sportsbooks the ability to increase bettors’ involvement and generate new revenue opportunities that were previously unavailable.</p>
<p>Co-Founder and CEO of BetSwap Limited, Brent Winston, said: “We are very excited to be partnering with Scientific Games in order to bring our innovative solution with industry-first functionality to the sports betting industry.”</p>
<p>Winston continued by expressing confidence in the partnership. In his words, this deal will offer bettors a fun and competitive new way to engage with their sportsbook – and other bettors – while also improving their betting experiences.</p>
<p>SVP Sportsbook, Digital at Scientific Games, Keith O’Loughlin stated that BetSwap’s forward-thinking product is a perfect addition to the OpenArena solution, which will provide users with innovative betting experiences, which is something the business is always focused on.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Increases Its Market Share in the US</p>
<p>Exacta Systems also decided to partner with Science Games (SG) to incorporate industry-leading content from SG’s award-winning game cabinets into the Exact Historical Horse Racing (HHR) system.</p>
<p>Residents of Virginia who enjoy visiting historical racing machines and are open to trying out new gamification options can now take advantage of the deal. When it comes to gaming legalization, especially skill-based games, Virginia has a few obstacles, but historical horse racing seems to be in the clear.</p>
<p>Exacta Systems will continue to broaden its product and scope, and Scientific Games will reach new audiences that may not have been aware of the company’s titles previously, thanks to Virginia’s welcoming regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Scientific Games previously struck a deal for its OpenArena platform with OtherLevels in January.</p>
