<p>Alexa Grasso vs Viviane Araujo is the headliner bout of UFC Fight Night 212. The reason why the UFC management booked this fight to headline Saturday’s event is that these two fighters are very similar quality-wise What this means is that the fight can go either way.</p>
<p>Although this is primarily a striker vs grappler clash, both Grasso and Araujo do have plenty of weapons in their arsenals. That said, it’s only logical to assume their duel is going to be a real spectacle. But who’s going to triumph in the end? To see what we think, just keep on reading this Grasso vs Araujo preview.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Alexa Grasso is Favored by the Bookies</p>
<p>Alexa Grasso is 14-3 in her professional career, with a 6-3 record since moving to the UFC in 2016. She was booked for UFC Fight Night 212 due to her fine performances in the flyweight division. It was 2020 when she moved to this weight class, beating Ji Yeon Kim in the divisional debut.</p>
<p>Next came the win over Maycee Barber, once again by decision. Then, in her most recent fight, Grasso defeated Joanne Wood by submission. It was her first submission win ever; she also has four wins by knockout and nine by decision.</p>
<p>All these facts show that she’s a well-rounded fighter with great stamina. She hasn’t fought a five-round fight before, but we don’t expect her to have any problems. What should worry her is that she’s never fought such a fantastic grappler as Araujo.</p>
<p>Can Araujo Choke Her Opponent Out?</p>
<p>Alexa Grasso is a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with not much wrestling experience. This explains why she’s won by submission only once. She did it against another BJJ purple belt, whose #1 focus is kickboxing.</p>
<p>Seven months after beating Wood, she’s taking on a submission expert. Viviane Araujo is the girl in question, who has an overall record of 11-3 with three wins by KO/TKO, four by submission, and four by decision.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that each of her previous six bouts was decided by the UFC judges. Another interesting fact is that since inking the deal with the UFC in 2019, she’s got no submission wins. However, Araujo is excellent on the floor, the evidence being that she’s a black belt not only in BJJ but also Luta Livre (Brazilian submission wrestling).</p>
<p>Alexa Grasso vs Viviane Araujo Prediction</p>
<p>Grasso’s strategy will be to try and outbox her opponent on Saturday. Meanwhile, Araujo’s best chance is if she manages to take her opponent down. So, which fighting style will prevail in the UFC Fight Night 212 headliner?</p>
<p>We think Grasso will dominate the first couple of rounds. However, near the end, we expect Araujo to take the fight to the mat, which is where she feels most comfortable.</p>
<p>Picks: Viviane Araujo to win by submission</p>
