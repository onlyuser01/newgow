<p>Thanks for your email. We are currently experiencing a very high number of emails and we are working hard to answer everything as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Submitting ID? This needs to be done on the website via the 'My Account' page and heading to the 'Account Details' section. If you have issues uploading your documents via the website, please send us a NEW email with your ID documents attached. However we must see that you have attempted the online service first.</p>
<p>If you have not done so already, for security reasons and to assist us with your query, please provide your username, DOB and postcode by replying to THIS email. We can only assist you if this information has been provided.</p>
<p>We kindly request that you do not create new email chains relating to the same issue, as this may push your request to the bottom of the queue and can cause delays.</p>
<p>Your request (1247801) has been received by our staff.</p>
<p>We aim to get back to customers within 3 business days. Please rest assured we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>................................................................</p>
<p>WHY IS MY WITHDRAWAL PENDING? (SUBMITTING ID DOCUMENTS) - Please note, ID documents must be submitted securely via the website.</p>
<p>Photo ID - driving license or passport</p>
<p>Proof of address - utility bill or bank statement dated in the last 3 months</p>
<p>Proof of payment method - e.g. a photo of your registered card(s) showing the name and last 4 digits.</p>
<p>If you haven't successfully submitted any of the above, this could be why your funds are still pending.</p>
<p>Head over to the ‘My Account’ page, click on ‘Account Details’. On this page you will be able to see a "Verification Status" section which lists the verification documents required for your account and the status of each document.</p>
<p>Proof of ID - this is your Photo ID such as driving license or passport. The ‘Provide’ link will redirect you, so you can upload your document securely. You will need to take a clear photo and ‘selfie’ image. Once done, you will be redirected back to your account. You can check the status of your uploaded document back on the ‘Account Details’ page. Note, if you are on desktop, you will initially be provided a QR code to scan with your mobile, then follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>Proof of Address - Go to the ‘Provide’ link located next to your proof of address. You will then be redirected to a website where you can connect automatically with your utility provider. This means no need to send photos! However, if your provider is not shown, do not worry - just click the ‘I can’t see my providers’ link and you will be able to upload a photo or PDF document via our "Document Upload" service - please allow 3 working days for this to be reviewed by our team.</p>
<p>Proof of Payment methods - Go to the ‘Provide’ link located next to your proof of payments. You will then be taken to the uploader page where you can choose which document you wish to upload and send to us. If you are providing a card, please ensure the middle 8 digits are covered for security reasons.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<p>All documents uploaded on the website must be JPG, PNG, or PDF files.</p>
<p>Ensure all documents are clear, so we can verify your details.</p>
<p>Please allow 3 working days for us to review any documents uploaded on the website. We kindly request you only email us once this time has passed.</p>
<p>You can always apply our safer gambling tools to your account (e.g., take a break) – this will not impact your balance or ability to be verified.</p>
<p>............................................................................................</p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING TOOLS - please note you can visit our responsible gambling page 24/7 (see the footer on every page of the website) to immediately apply gambling management tools, without waiting for support assistance - this includes deposit limits, take a break and self-exclusion.</p>
<p>APPLYING THESE TOOLS WILL NOT IMPACT THE VALIDITY OF ANY WINNINGS OR BALANCE ON YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>Check out our FAQ section too - your answer may also be found there.</p>
