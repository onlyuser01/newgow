<p>Leading global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment group Entain announced on Thursday that it created exclusive content for Formula 1 fans. The unique experiences and media content can be accessed by fans via its PartyCasino and Partypoker brands.</p>
<p>F1 Fans Can Now Enjoy Exclusive McLaren Content from Entain</p>
<p>The new experiences mark a new stage in the collaboration between McLaren F1 and Entain’s Party brands that kicked in at the start of this year’s F1 season. As a part of the collaboration, F1 fans will be able to access new offers by visiting the McLaren F1 access page on the PartyCasino and Partypoker websites.</p>
<p>This is the first year in a multi-year partnership between Entain and McLaren F1, with both companies promising further exclusive content and experiences for fans in 2022,” Statement released by Entain</p>
<p>Such exclusive offers include Super Fan competitions. F1 fans are invited to participate and test their knowledge. By joining, fans are asked to match F1 race cars with the date they raced. Each fan’s score will be visible via a leaderboard, and everyone will be competing for the grand prize, which is a McLaren F1 helmet.</p>
<p>F1 fans can also enjoy a brand new video released earlier this week that features McLaren Racing’s CEO, Zak Brown. In fact, this is the second exclusive video of a series led by Daniel Riccardo, the famous McLaren F1 driver. Entain revealed that a new “See the Unseen” video is expected to be released and will feature McLaren F1’s engineering team, as well as pit crew. Additionally, Entain said that a second episode featuring Riccardo can be expected in December.</p>

<p>Entain to Launch a F2P McLaren Game Next Month</p>

The exciting game will come just in time for the Grand Prix in Brazil and Mexico.

<p>Entain’s commercial director and managing director of Party brands, Paris Anatolitis, said that the company wants Party to be a destination for sports fans who can share experiences regarding the sports they love. He added that Entain’s collaboration with McLaren is “about creating recreational content which encourages people to take a look and explore new ways of enjoying themselves with our brands.”</p>
