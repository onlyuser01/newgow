    <h1>Top Online Casino Station Casinos Bingo Saganing Eagle Casino New Online Casino Usa Casinos With Buf</h1>

<p>I want all of my deposits to be returned. How can it be that I deposit every time and the promised mechanics never work?</p>
<p>How many spins do I have to do with moonprincess or rise of olympus until decisions are finally made that are good for the player, and not just for the casino.</p>
<p>Somewhere it's over - I already know what I'll hear - yes, that's all fair play - that's game mechanics, and so on and immediately.</p>
<p>The first princess or hadres has the ability to convert characters into pictures. No matter where we have 4 characters and 3 pictures. So after he decides, it is already certain that he will choose a character.</p>
<p>Now he has the opportunity to choose between the remaining 3 characters or from the 3 different images (gods, princes). That means from this point in time when he decides there is a 50-50 chance. But that does not come to the wearing here. most of them only signs, and if he or she chooses a picture, then it won't do any good. And if I get a picture out of 10 attempts - is that the 50-50 chance?</p>
<p>If that's the random number generator, then I wonder why I've been getting shit for so long since April? This is not just a blessing but also elsewhere. I would like to know what Playngo did with these games?</p>
<p>You used to get 5 pictures in a row after a spin - haven't I got it for months?</p>
<p>I'm not about high winnings - of course everyone wants to hit the jackpot at some point - I just want to have the feeling again that I have a fair cahnce in my games - just the feeling that something could work - no more</p>
