<p>Crystal Palace vs. Arsenal is the final game of the second round of the 2023-24 Premier League</p>
<p>Arsenal is the No. 2 favorite to win the 2023-24 Premier League, but the Gunners did not impress much in the opening round. Sure, they did win against Nottingham, but the score was just 2-1, which is kind of embarrassing as the game was played on their turf.</p>
<p>A week later, they’re locking horns with Crystal Palace, their rival from South London, and a team with which they’ve got a pretty decent record. The Eagles started their EPL campaign with a 1-0 win over Sheffield United on the road, but even their hardest fans don’t think they stand a good chance of doing the same to Arsenal this coming Monday. But maybe they can grab themselves a draw?</p>

<p>Crystal Palace Praying for Another Good Result</p>
<p>Despite a win in the first round, Crystal Palace isn’t expected to have a good season. The thing is that the Eagles’ roster just doesn’t look as good as last season when they finished 11th. It’s because during the summer transfer window, a number of important players left them – Wilfred Zaha (to Galatasaray), Luka Milivojevic (Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai), and Jack Butland (Rangers).</p>
<p>Crystal Palace fans, what would you rate your transfer window this season? 🤔</p>
<p>✍🏻Matheus Franca</p>
<p>✍🏻Jefferson Lerma</p>
<p>❌Wilfred Zaha</p>
<p>❌Luka Milivojevic</p>

<p>Plus, James McArthur decided to retire at the end of the last season, while Albert Sambi Lokonga’s loan deal expired, so he moved back to Arsenal. So, how did they get a win on the road in the first round of the new EPL season?</p>
<p>Well, it’s because they played against Sheffield United, a team that played in the Championship last season. They were much better against the Blades, but the fact is that they’re nowhere near the Gunners in terms of player quality.</p>
<p>Arsenal Planning to Challenge for the EPL Title (Again)</p>
<p>It’s been 20 years since Arsenal won the Premier League the last time. Getting ahold of the trophy won’t be easy as Manchester City has no intention of giving it away, but if there’s a team that can end the dominance of the Citizens, it’s Arsenal.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Mikel Arteta’s team looks really good. Sure, there are a couple of players on the injury list, but overall, the Gunners look capable of challenging for the trophy. They’re strong in every single area of the game, although their offense isn’t that sharp at the moment. But that’s bound to change once Gabriel Jesus returns from an injury.</p>
<p>This is probably the reason why they didn’t score more than two goals against Nottingham in the first round. Another possible reason is that that their players were a bit frustrated because of the 30-minute delay of the game caused by the failure of the electronic ticketing system at Emirates.</p>
<p>But that’s all in the past, and they’re ready for the South London duel with Crystal Palace. They’re coming to Selhurst Park to grab all three points as no other option is on the table if they want to win the title this year.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace vs. Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>Arsenal has title ambitions this year, which is why winning games against opponents like Crystal Palace is a must. That said, we’re almost 100% certain they’ll win all three points on Monday.</p>
<p>Pick: Arsenal to win</p>
