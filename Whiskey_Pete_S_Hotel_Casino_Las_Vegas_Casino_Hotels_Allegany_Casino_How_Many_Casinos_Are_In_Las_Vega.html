    <h1>Whiskey Pete S Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotels Allegany Casino How Many Casinos Are In Las Vega</h1>

<p>The operator, part of the Gauselmann Group, has appointed Irina Ruf as its new managing director, the first woman to hold the role</p>
<p>Ruf, who brings an extensive experience with her, will be responsible for helping the company expand in existing markets as well as strategize about expansion in new jurisdictions where and when possible. She was naturally pleased with the development:</p>
<p>I am looking forward to developing new geographical markets and implementing exciting projects together with my team. One particular focus will be on developing the online markets. Merkur Casino managing director Irina Ruf</p>
<p>She is taking the reins over from Stefan Bruns, the outgoing incumbent, who will be now part of Gauselmann Group’s Management Board. The rotation of the new positions was welcomed by Gauselmann Group Management Board member Dieter Kuhlmann who said that Ruf would make an excellent addition to the group and specifically in her new position.</p>
<p>A Long-Standing Veteran of Merkur Casino</p>
<p>The entire board is delighted to see her take up her new responsibilities and bring what is an extensive experience and expertise in the gambling industry under Gauselmann’s roof. Kuhlmann added:</p>
<p>Based on her wide-ranging career path to date, Ms Ruf brings to the job all the prerequisites to successfully continue and expand Merkur Casino’s international business activities. Gauselmann Group Management Board member Dieter Kuhlmann</p>
<p>Ruf is not an old face in Merkur Casino, however. She has been with the company for the past close to nine years. Ruf started as head of business development back in October and she has climbed the pecking order, honing her industry knowledge and learning more about the company’s internal structures and goals.</p>
<p>She has worked across operations and provided her knowledge to advance the company’s overall objectives. Ruf entered her latest position of executive operations director in June 2020, and will now transition to the role of managing director at Ruf.</p>
