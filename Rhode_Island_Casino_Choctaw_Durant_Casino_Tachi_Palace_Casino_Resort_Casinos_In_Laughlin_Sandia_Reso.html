    <h1>Rhode Island Casino Choctaw Durant Casino Tachi Palace Casino Resort Casinos In Laughlin Sandia Reso</h1>

<p>Low6, an award-winning sports gamification platform and company that recently rebranded, has struck a new partnership with SCCG Management, which will allow the company to drive its push in the North American market. Through this partnership, Low6 technology will be deployed with sports betting operators across the region to help with the acquisition of new customers, the company reported in a press release.</p>
<p>Low6 is not relying just on this partnership to establish its footprint in the region, however. The company has already successfully teamed up with a number of US-based teams and leagues. Some of its partners today include, the UFC and PGA Tour, along with sports teams such as the Cincinnati Bengals and the Detroit Pistons.</p>
<p>Low6 is confident that its new tie-up with SCCG is a step forward and an opportunity to, as the company puts it, “turbo-charge” its ability to extend trusted betting solutions. The true strength of Low6’s solutions lies in the free-to-play range which is a powerful gamification solution that has been successfully leveraged with sports fans, leading to better engagement and interest in the sports. Retention has also notched up.</p>
<p>Low6 has achieved that by observing industry trends and delivering tailored turnkey B2B solutions to help it achieve this and more. Then again, SCCG Management is not a random partner either. It’s one of the most prominent strategic consultation companies in the North American sports market and is likely to remain so. It already has agreements with a number of sports teams, including the Bengals, the Colorado Rockies, the Iowa Cubs, the Denver Broncos, and so many more.</p>
<p>So far as its ties to actual sports leagues and organizations go, SCCG Management is associated with the American Cornhole League, Major Arena Soccer League, and American Ultimate Disc League. The nature of these deals ranges from data distribution and strategic co-development to leveraging the available data to drive better content and engagement.</p>
<p>Welcomed Chance for Low6 and Company’s Further Expansion</p>
<p>There is perhaps hardly a better partner than Low6 to deliver on the latter. Low6 CEO Jamie Mitchell welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with SCCG:</p>
<p>With a number of operators already onboard, our development partnership with SCCG will enable even more sports betting brands in North America to access the engaging content that we offer via the Low6 Gamification Platform to convert, retain and monetize their users. Low6 CEO Jamie Mitchell</p>
<p>Low6 has reported strong and consistent results over the past 12 months. The company also launched a white label acquisition platform, Mitchell noted and is still focused on working closely with US sports leagues and clubs.</p>
