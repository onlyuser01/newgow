<p>Jackpocket and ESPN NY sports app are now official partners, the companies confirmed on Friday. The new partnership will see the independent third-party app that enables consumers to purchase state-run lottery tickets step in as the exclusive partner for the ESPN New York sports app.</p>
<p>This new partnership, believes Jackpocket founder and CEO Peter Sullivan, will empower both companies’ products and propositions, leading to better visibility for their respective brands and names. Sullivan spoke about the build-up to the new sports season and the auspicious moment of the partnership and said that ESPN was an iconic brand with established popularity in the tri-state area.</p>
<p>Jackpocket has described this partnership as its largest sports broadcasting promotion to date, after previously striking similar partnerships with the New York Jets and the New York Mets, two other prominent sports franchises in the Empire State.</p>
<p>The question remains what specific synergies will be achieved beyond brandability? According to Jackpocket, the company will have special access to ESPN events and experiences. Jackpocket will have eight invites to the Q&amp;A event hosted by the New York Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone which is taking place at the New York Athletic Club.</p>
<p>ESPN will help Jackpocket promote its own VIP experiences and giveaways. Jackpocket’s name will be mentioned by ESPN New York presenters and personalities and the company’s logo will be visible on the ESPN New York app’s front page. ESPN will also offer downloadable links to the Jackpocket app, which should lead to conversions for the lottery company.</p>
<p>ESPN New York Market Manager Vinny DiMarco welcomed this opportunity and said his company was pleased to be welcoming Jackpocket into the fold. DiMarco argued that ESPN makes it possible for gaming and sports to meet and provide a unique and convenient product to fans.</p>
<p>"We look forward to the future of the partnership as it continues to evolve with event activation and content integration," the executive concluded. Jackpocket has been particularly interested in securing partnerships with various sports franchises and leagues. Today, Jackpocket has existing ties with the NFL, NBA, and the NHL.</p>
<p>In July, Jackpocket expanded in Montana as the company seeks to become a country-wide and recognizable platform for various gaming and sports experiences. Jackpocket offers tickets to some of the most significant Jackpocket games such as Mega Millions.</p>
