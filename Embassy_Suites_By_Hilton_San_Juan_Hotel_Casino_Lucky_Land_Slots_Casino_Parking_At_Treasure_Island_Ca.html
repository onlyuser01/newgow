    <h1>Embassy Suites By Hilton San Juan Hotel Casino Lucky Land Slots Casino Parking At Treasure Island Ca</h1>

<p>Scout Gaming Group, the leading provider of B2B fantasy sports and sports betting products, joined forces with Nuvei Corporation, the global electronic payment processing company.</p>
<p>FanTeam to Offer New Payment Options under a New Deal</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, announced on Thursday, Nuvei will boost Scout Gaming’s expansion into the US by offering a variety of payment options. The collaboration will see Scout Gaming’s US-facing daily fantasy sports app, FanTeam, gain access to an array of online payment options from Nuvei. The new deal is expected to bring FanTeam more than 500 contemporary payment methods within more than 200 markets globally after only a single integration.</p>
<p>Moreover, the daily fantasy sportsbook will be able to leverage Nuvei’s leading payment processing services in the US. These services include account-to-account transfers, card processing, as well as instant payments for payouts and deposits. For FanTeam, offering innovative payments will help increase customer retention. The sportsbook is also seeking to broaden market awareness and increase its acceptance rates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thanks to the recent deal, Nuvei will solidify its presence as a leading payments partner within the sports betting and fantasy sports industries. It comes as no surprise that both industries are expected to continue growing and to attract more operators. This will undoubtedly help Nuvei expand its customer portfolio by adding more US sportsbooks and introducing its innovative technology which will help them maximize their revenues.</p>
<p>The New Deal Will Bring Benefits for the Two Companies</p>
<p>Scout Gaming’s CEO, Andreas Ternström, revealed that the company is always on the lookout to offer diverse payment solutions for its players. Moreover, he added that thanks to the new deal with Nuvei, Scout Gaming will be able to continue offering unrivaled fantasy sports experiences for its customers.</p>
<p>“As one of the leading daily fantasy sports providers, we are constantly looking for diverse payment solutions for our players.” Andreas Ternström, CEO at Scout Gaming Group</p>
<p>Nuvei’s CEO and chair, Philip Fayer, added that offering the best payment experiences has been a key priority for the company. He outlined that the company is “excited to support Scout Gaming to grow their player-base as they expand into the US through a best-in-class user experience.”</p>
<p>“Providing the best payment experience is at the heart of what Nuvei does.” Philip Fayer, CEO and chair at Nuvei</p>
<p>The recent deal comes a time when Nuvei completed changes to its senior leadership team back in February. By now, the company’s proprietary platform offers seamless pay-in and payout capabilities, which helps customers and merchants in more than 200 markets globally. Besides supporting nearly 150 currencies, Nuvei’s platform also operates with 40 cryptocurrencies.</p>
