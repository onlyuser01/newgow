<p>Wind Creek Hospitality is the commercial gaming unit of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally recognized tribe based in Alabama. In late 2021, the Illinois Gaming Board awarded Wind Creek the state’s lone gaming concession allocated for Chicago’s South Suburbs.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Chicago Southland began constructing the $300 million casino resort in East Hazel Crest in June 2022.</p>
<p>The development includes a 70,000-square-foot casino with 1,350 slot machines, 56 table games, and a sportsbook. The resort will feature a 16-story, 252-room hotel with an indoor pool, a fitness center, a spa, an entertainment and events center, and an array of dining options.</p>
<p>Chicago Casinos in Development</p>
<p>Speaking recently with the Chicago Tribune, Wind Creek Chicago Southland Executive Vice President and General Manager Roger Kuehn said construction is progressing on schedule. Kuehn said a topping out of the hotel is expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“It is still kind of a dart throw, but I would expect sometime in the third quarter of 2024. I think that is a fair timeline,” Kuehn said in reference to the July through September period.</p>
<p>Wind Creek Chicago Southland will soon begin a hiring spree, as the forthcoming casino and resort will be expected to employ about 800 workers.</p>
<p>Illinois lawmakers in 2019 passed a Chicago-area gaming bill. Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signed the measure designed to generate new tax revenue for infrastructure.</p>
<p>The gaming package included five suburban casino licenses, with one each earmarked for Danville, Rockford, South Suburbs, Waukegan, and Williamson County. A sixth casino was authorized for the downtown Chicago area, with Bally’s now building a $1.7 billion integrated resort at the Freedom Center.</p>
<p>The $100 million Golden Nugget Danville opened in May with 500 slot machines and 15 table games. Hard Rock International is investing $358 million to construct the permanent Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Rockford. A temporary casino opened in November 2021.</p>
<p>In Waukegan, Full House Resorts is spending $400 million to build its American Place Casino Resort. It opened a provisional gaming space in February of this year. And in Williamson County, the Walker’s Bluff Casino Resort from Boyd Gaming opened this past August for $147 million.</p>
<p>Community Partner</p>
<p>Wind Creek has pledged the South Suburbs to be a strong community partner, something the company has demonstrated in other markets where it operates.</p>
<p>In its native Alabama, Wind Creek operates three Class I and II tribal casinos: Wind Creek Atmore, Wind Creek Montgomery, and Wind Creek Wetumpka. In 2019, the company covered the funeral expenses for all 23 victims of a deadly tornado. The casino company also made a $25K donation to a church damaged by the tornado, though the congregation returned the money on moral grounds.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, where Wind Creek owns and operates Wind Creek Bethlehem, a commercial casino acquired from Las Vegas Sands in 2019 for $1.3 billion, the company provided thousands of its workers with stimulus checks to offset inflation last year.</p>
