<p>Billionaire former casino mogul Steve Wynn has listed his New York City penthouse overlooking Central Park for $90 million.</p>
<p>Located on the 30th and 31st floors of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and accessible only by a private elevator, the duplex spans 10,875 square feet. It includes three bedrooms, four bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, 15-foot ceilings, and views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline.</p>

<p>Wynn paid $70 million for the place in 2012 to Millennium Partners founding partner Christopher Jeffries, according to The Real Deal. (Millennium was the firm that renovated the 36-story hotel at 50 Central Park South – originally opened as the Hotel St. Moritz in 1930 – to add 11 condo units, including Wynn’s.)</p>
<p>The penthouse’s 44-foot long living room – which features 10 arched windows and the largest terrace in the building – once served as the Hotel St. Moritz’s ballroom.</p>
<p>Downstairs is the private quarters, accessed via a marble staircase. The primary suite here features a spa-like bathroom, a dressing room, a gym, and a massage room.</p>
<p>The other two bedrooms include ensuite baths.</p>
<p>“Residents also benefit from the world-class luxury services and amenities of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which include the La Prairie spa and health club, the business center, the Contour Bar and Lounge, in-room dining services, and housekeeping,” the Sotheby’s International Realty listing notes. (Common charges for the amenities are $19,107 per month, not including the $15,506 in taxes.)</p>
<p>Flipping Out</p>
<p>Wynn, 80, is also trying to sell his Benedict Canyon Drive mansion in Beverly Hills, according to the Real Deal. He listed it in March 2020 for $135 million, later cutting the price to $115 million. In April, still without a taker, he reduced his ask to $100 million. It is still for sale. He purchased it in 2015 from Guess cofounder Maurice Marciano for $47.85 million.</p>
<p>Wynn also recently listed a lakefront Palm Beach, Fla. mansion he paid $49 million for last year. He’s asking $78.5 million. And in April, he sold another Palm Beach Fla. mansion he purchased for $24 million last year for $32 million.</p>
<p>Wynn, founder and former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts, resigned from the company he founded in 2018 after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed by the Wall Street Journal. Wynn has repeatedly asserted that he never harassed or sexually assaulted anyone.</p>
<p>Since quitting the casino business, he has reinvented himself as a Florida-based art dealer.</p>
<p>It sounds like he’s a house-flipper now, too.</p>
