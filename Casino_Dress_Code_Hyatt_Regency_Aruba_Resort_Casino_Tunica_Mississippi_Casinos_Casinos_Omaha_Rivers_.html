    <h1>Casino Dress Code Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort Casino Tunica Mississippi Casinos Casinos Omaha Rivers</h1>

<p>After securing its license to launch in Ontario at the start of April, releasing the sequel to its popular Raging Rex game in mid-March, and launching Rise of Gods: Reckoning at the beginning of May, Play’n GO has made a new announcement. The prestigious iGaming provider with a clear goal to become the “best gaming entertainment supplier” has added yet another exciting slot to its portfolio: Idol of Fortune.</p>
<p>The game has found its inspiration in the Indian subcontinent, choosing its focus on Ganesha, one of the 300+ million gods part of the culture here.</p>

<p>Swedish Game Wizards Want to See If Fortune Is by Your Side</p>
<p>Play’n GO has previously launched Riche Wilde and Pearls of India, two games that were also inspired by the mesmerizing Asian culture. The new release portrays Ganesha, the god with an elephant head. The developer chose Ganesha as a means of symbolizing the intellectual power and wisdom a person must have in order to achieve perfection in life.</p>
<p>Ganesha is also regarded as Shiva’s child, the God of Destruction in the Hindi culture, as well as the remover of all obstacles. The god is portrayed relaxing behind the game grid and occasionally popping up in front of it in order to signal a win within the game. The Indian culture is fairly visible in the rest of the design, with vividly colored elements, swirling lines, and wild animals coming to life. The game has a nicely executed theme that helps it stick its head above the crowd.</p>
<p>Players are invited to let serenity take them over inside Ganesha’s temple while watching all obstacles disappear one by one, leading the way to the riches within the game.</p>
<p>Idol of Fortune: Game Features</p>
<p>The developer added a few exciting features including free spins, mystery symbols, and the Wild Prize extra feature. A player who manages to land between 3 and 5 scatters will collect 5x, 10x, or 50x the original bet, in addition to unlocking a number of free spins. Players will get to take their pick from six different bonus round options with free spins ranging between 8 and 20 and mystery symbols ranging from 8 to 48. A player can also choose the lucky dip alternative that will randomly mix and match free spins together with mystery spins.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols will only show up in free spins on any of the reels, sticking to them and spreading a single position between the spins, either upwards or downwards. Players who choose the Mystery Pick can win up to 88 Mystery Symbols with 20 Free Spins. Free spins cannot be retriggered during the game.</p>
<p>The Wild Prize feature can be triggered on any of the paid spins, turning either of the 5 reels into a Gold Reel.</p>
<p>When the Wild Prize lands on a Gold Reel, the player is allowed to choose his coins until he reveals three identical types of coins, winning a Wild Prize. The Wild Prize ranges from 10x to 5,000x the stake.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s head of games Charlotte Miliziano expressed the company’s excitement about being able to create such a vast variety of characters, game styles, and different themes, making its portfolio “unmatched in the industry”.</p>
