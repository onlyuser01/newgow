<p>The next destination for Monday Night Football is Lumen Field in Seattle. That’s where the Seattle Seahawks will welcome the New Orleans Saints. This is going to be their eighth meeting in Washington State in the 21st century. Five of the previous seven were won by the hosts.</p>
<p>This time, however, oddsmakers think it’s going to be the other way around, the main reason being that Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is out with an injury.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the Seahawks are in dreadful form. Their 2021 record is 2-4. The Saints have been better, with a 3-2 record so far. They also had a bye in Week 6, meaning that they’ve had more time to prepare for the MNF clash.</p>

<p>Franchise Legend Russell Wilson to Miss the Week 7 Game</p>
<p>Even with their best player in the team, the Seahawks weren’t great. However, without Wilson as their play-caller, they look desperate.</p>
<p>The quarterback injured his finger in the Week 5 game against the LA Rams. Geno Smith entered as his replacement, but did not impress.</p>
<p>Smith was their starting QB in Week 6 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He did okay, with 209 passing yards for one touchdown, but that wasn’t enough for his team to win.</p>
<p>They did take the game to overtime after 20-20 in regulation. However, they failed to take their chances in the remainder of the game, for which the Steelers punished them with a field goal.</p>
<p>In order to get anything from the Monday Night Football game, they will need to up their offensive game. Unfortunately for the Seahawks, they’ll be playing against one of the league’s best defenses.</p>
<p>The Saints’ Defense Looks Unbeatable</p>
<p>With just 91 points conceded, the Saints have a truly elite defensive team. They did play one game fewer than most other teams, but, with 18.2 points conceded per game on average, they are among the elite.</p>
<p>This team ranks second on rushing yards, having allowed the opponents to cover only 79 yards so far. On top of that, their secondary has nine interceptions in total, with three of their players currently at two interceptions each.</p>
<p>With no Wilson to cause them headaches, the Saints defense should have a field day in Seattle. The question is whether their offense can deliver?</p>
<p>This is the first season without Drew Brees as their starting quarterback, which explains why the Saints haven’t been scoring a lot. Still, in the previous game they played – against the WFT – we saw the Saints QB Jameis Wilson throwing for 279 yards and four touchdowns, which was his best performance this season.</p>
<p>He just needs to keep on playing like this and the Saints should have no problems beating the Seahawks. Still, even if he doesn’t do it, New Orleans has another ace up the sleeve. This team’s running backs have been pretty good so far.</p>
<p>Alvin Kamara is their rushing leader with 368 yards and one touchdown, followed by Wilson, who currently has 77 rushing yards and one touchdown.</p>
<p>Pick: New Orleans Saints to win and cover the spread; the under should hit.</p>
