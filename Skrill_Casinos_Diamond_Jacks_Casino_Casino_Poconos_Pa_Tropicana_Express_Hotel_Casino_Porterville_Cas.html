<p>Genius Sports, a B2B data management, video streaming, and integrity services provider, has signed an expansion of its pre-existing deal with the betting operator Betway.</p>
<p>Genius Sports to Enhance Betway’s Offerings</p>
<p>The expanded deal will see Genius Sports power Betway with its proprietary LiveData and LiveTrading solutions. Thanks to this, Betway will be able to implement real-time data and prices to its sports betting offerings. The deal covers some of the major sports events, such as the National Football League, the English Premier League, Euroleague Basketball, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.</p>
<p>Speaking of the NFL, Genius Sports will provide Betway with its other NFL solutions as well. The operator will benefit from Next Gen Stats and will be able to add real-time statistics and official sports betting data feed.</p>
<p>The partnership doesn’t end there as the B2B company will take a part in Betway’s marketing efforts by providing it with its digital marketing tools. This way, the operator will be able to better promote its offerings across the digital space and improve customer engagement.</p>
<p>The Parties Are Glad to Continue Their Relations</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ chief executive officer, Mark Locke, spoke on the deal. He is happy to extend the partnership between the two companies as he is aware that Betway is a reliable operator and admires its commitment to excellence. Locke is also glad to be able to continue supporting Betway as the betting brand conquers new markers.</p>
<p>“The Betway brand is growing rapidly across the U.S. and we’re thrilled to be helping accelerate this expansion with our premium official sports betting feeds, live streaming, and fan engagement solutions.” Genius Sports CEO Mark Locke</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, the chief executive officer of Betway, shared his enthusiasm to have Genius Sport by the operator’s side. Werkman is delighted by the opportunity to expand the partnership and, by extension, add the LiveData and LiveTrading solutions to Betway’s NFL betting offerings.</p>
<p>“As our brand continues to grow globally, we are constantly seeking new ways to enhance the Betway customer experience, and this data and technology achieve that. We look forward to continuing our great working relationship with Genius Sports through this latest agreement.” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman</p>
<p>Genius Sports is looking to secure extensions of its partnership ahead of the new seasons of the world’s most popular sporting events. The B2B provider recently expanded its deal with another betting operator, the British company bet365. Through that deal, bet365 secured Genius Sports’ real-time statistics solution, Next Gen Stats.</p>
