<p>Dortmund vs Chelsea is a clash of the Round of 16 of the 2022-23 Champions League. The game is taking place at Westfalenstadion on Wednesday, February 15, 2023</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund players have been nothing short of brilliant since the start of 2023. Truth be told, they haven’t played against real heavyweights such as Chelsea, their opponent in the first round of the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>The good news for Dortmund is that the Blues aren’t in great form. The bad news for them is that the English team is packed with talent, especially considering that the new owner Todd Boehly has spent more than $600 million on transfers.</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund are Without a Loss at Westfalenstadion Since August</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of Borussia Dortmund in Wednesday’s game is that it’s played on their turf. Westfalenstadion a.k.a. Signal Iduna Park is famous for the atmosphere when Dortmund plays, which explains why this team is undefeated at home since August 20, 2022. In the two home games played in 2023, they defeated Augsburg 4-3 and Freiburg 5-1.</p>
<p>BVB have been in good form on the road as well, and the main reason for this is that they have a clear bill when it comes to injuries. Thomas Meunier is the only player who’s struggling with fitness, but we could see the Belgian right-back make his comeback on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The thing is that the RB position has been Dortmund’s Achilles’ heel this season. With Meunier sidelined, coach Edin Terzic has been switching between Julian Ryerson and Marius Wolf on the right side of the defense line.</p>
<p>Is It Time for Chelsea to Up Their Form?</p>
<p>Chelsea players can’t be proud of their form, but everyone seems to think good things are on the horizon for the Blues. The thing is that the club has spent huge sums of money on signings, and it’s only a matter of time before new Chelsea players start showing their worth.</p>
<p>This goes especially for the Chelsea attackers – Joao Felix, Mykhailo Murdyk, and David Datro Fofana. These guys have the talent to be world-beaters, they just need to start showing it.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a big question mark over whether they’re going to play on Wednesday, knowing that the competition in Chelsea’s offense is fierce, especially now that Raheem Sterling has returned from an injury.</p>
<p>Dortmund vs Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams have great attackers on the roster, the only difference is that Dortmund’s attackers have been scoring much more than those playing for Chelsea. Still, we do have faith in the Blues’ offense, and we can definitely see them score a goal or two on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But can they stop Dortmund from scoring? Highly unlikely. Instead, this is going to be a high-scoring affair, in which the hosts will probably score more.</p>
<p>Pick: Dortmund to win and over 2.5 goals</p>
