<p>Los Angeles Chargers Favored Over Oakland Raiders Thursday Night, Philip Rivers Makes Coliseum Swan Song</p>

<p>Tonight marks Rivers’ 14th trip to the Coliseum – aka the “The Black Hole.” The eight-time Pro Bowler has spent his entire career with the Chargers, and has been the team’s starter since 2006.</p>
<p>The Raiders will move to Las Vegas for the 2020 NFL season, meaning this will presumably be Rivers’ last hurrah at the Coliseum.</p>
<p>The over/under is at 48.5 points. The moneyline has -126 on the favored Chargers, and +110 on the underdog Raiders in what’s expected to be a close AFC West battle.</p>
<p>“Think of the team you played in high school that was kind of that crosstown team that you always look forward to,” Philip Rivers said. “It’s that kind of old-school rivalry.”</p>
<p>River Card</p>
<p>Many NFL coaches aren’t exactly fond of playing on Thursday night. It gives teams just three days to prepare, assuming they played the previous Sunday.</p>
<p>“I hate this. I don’t believe in this Thursday football,” Raiders coach Jon Gruden stated. “I’m not going to be on my soap box any more than that. It hurts both teams, obviously the preparation.”</p>
<p>“We take a lot of pride in getting our guys ready to play. We need a little time to do that. But a lot of people disagree with me, obviously, so it’ll be a challenge,” Gruden added.</p>
<p>Rivers will most certainly be prepared and ready for the Coliseum nighttime atmosphere. Only nine players on the Raiders roster have played in more games at the venue than Rivers.</p>
<p>I love playing there,” Rivers explained. “The fact that it’s a night game, too. Division game, both teams right there in the mix. It’ll be cranked up pretty good.”</p>
<p>The Chargers (4-5) and Raiders (4-4) are both chasing after the AFC West leading Kansas City Chiefs (6-3).</p>
<p>FanDuel has LA and Oakland respectively at +7500 and +10000 to win Super Bowl 54. A $100 bet would net $7,500 and $10,000.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame?</p>
<p>ESPN this week named Rivers the best QB in NFL history to never reach a Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“There’s no quarterback in modern league history … who has delivered more above-average seasons without sneaking into a Super Bowl than the man who will make his 229th career start for the Chargers on Thursday night,” ESPN staffer Bill Barwell opined.</p>
<p>Rivers is No. 6 in all-time passing yards. That’s ahead of such names as John Elway, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Bledsoe, and Joe Montana. He’s also No. 6 in passing touchdowns, and No. 7 in passing completions.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty darn good resume, but again – he’s never played in the big game every NFLer seeks. The odds aren’t good Rivers will be there this year, either.</p>
<p>The Chargers are at +4500 to win the AFC Championship. That’s implied odds of just 2.17 percent.</p>
