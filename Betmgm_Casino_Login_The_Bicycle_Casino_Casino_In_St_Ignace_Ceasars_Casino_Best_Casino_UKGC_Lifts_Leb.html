<p>UK Gambling regulator the Gambling Commission has lifted the license suspension it imposed on sports betting and soccer prediction operator Lebom Limited on November 3 in connection with the company’s failure to integrate the self-exclusion service GAMSTOP into its mobile application and product offerings.</p>
<p>Lebom Limited Integrated GAMSTOP Into Its Services in Just a Few Days</p>
<p>Lebom Limited was quick to react to the Gambling Commission suspending its license. Lebom Limited’s license was suspended on November 3 and the suspension was lifted on November 8 after the sports wagering operator remedied its lack of compliance.</p>
<p>Only a few days after the UK gambling regulator stopped it from offering any gambling services to customers the soccer prediction platform took action and integrated GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission made GAMSTOP integration mandatory for all licensees offering gambling products on the UK market back in 2020.</p>
<p>Lebom Limited was started in 2019 but it took a suspension from the regulator for the company to finally implement GAMSTOP, two years after the integration was made mandatory by the Commission.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP is a self-exclusion scheme that helps gamblers in the UK control their gambling habits and promotes safer gambling practices. It also provides support to people suffering from gambling harm and their families.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission Has Proven It Takes Strict Measures Against Violations</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission has already shown it does not make any compromises when it comes to enforcing the relevant regulations and major stakeholders in the UK gambling market such as Entain, Betway, and Smarkets, have already suffered under its iron fist.</p>
<p>In September, the Commission imposed a major fine of $3.07 million on Petfre Limited, which operates the Betfred brand, for shortcomings related to anti-money laundering and safe gambling. One example the Commission cited was a player whom Betfred allowed to gamble away $75,000 in just 10 hours after he registered his account.</p>
<p>In August, Entain Group was slapped with a whopping fine of $20.60 million because of similar social responsibility and anti-money laundering deficiencies. The fine was divided between Entain’s retail and online businesses, which were fined $3.68 million and $16.92 million respectively.</p>
<p>Another company fined for violations and failings related to the same issues in August was Smarkets. After it was revealed that the company allowed its customers to deposit significant amounts without doing any checks on where the funds come from, Smarkets had to pay a fine of $770,000. Back in September 2021, another sports betting operator also came under the regulator’s radar. Betway received a fine of $464,000 after the Commission found out that the company had added its logo with a hyperlink to its website to the web pages targeted at children on the West Ham United FC website.</p>
