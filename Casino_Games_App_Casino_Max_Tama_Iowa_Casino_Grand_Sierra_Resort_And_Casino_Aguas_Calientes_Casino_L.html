<p>After losing three games in a row, Steve Cherundolo’s boys will try to beat Atlanta United this Wednesday. Oddsmakers see LAFC as the favorite, but the Georgia-based franchise mustn’t be underestimated. After all, Atlanta Utd is the most valuable team in the MLS.</p>

<p>LAFC Aiming for the No. 1 Spot in the West</p>
<p>Los Angeles FC lost the last three games, but none of those were MLS matches. Instead, the reigning MLS Cup champions lost a game in the US Open Cup, along with two games in the CONCACAF Champions League.</p>
<p>In the domestic league, however, Cherundolo’s men have been brilliant this season. They’re 7-4-1, which accounts for 25 points. That’s three fewer than the current table leader St. Louis City, which is a team that’s played two games more. Further, LAFC has two points fewer than the Seattle Sounders, but this team has played five games more.</p>
<p>What this basically means is that we could see LAFC get to the top of the MLS Western Conference with a win over Atlanta United on Wednesday evening. For that to happen, however, they need a big win because the table leader currently has a better goal difference.</p>
<p>Atlanta United Is One of the Richest Teams in America</p>
<p>Even though Atlanta United isn’t having a vintage season, this team is doing relatively well. The boys from Georgia are sitting in the No. 6 position in the Eastern Conference, which isn’t impressive but is far from bad.</p>
<p>Still, they probably feel as if they could’ve done better. After all, they’ve got one of the most valuable rosters on the continent. Their most valuable player is Argentine midfielder Thiago Almada who’s one of the dark horses for winning the MLS MVP award at the end of the season.</p>
<p>His teammates, however, aren’t at his level. Sure, there are some Atlanta United players who’ve been decent in 2023 (e.g., Georgios Giakoumakis), but if they upped their form, this team would end up much higher in the standings.</p>
<p>LAFC vs Atlanta United Prediction</p>
<p>The home team has better players, but Atlanta mustn’t be underestimated. With Thiago Almada leading the charge, this team seems capable of scoring against any opponent. The trouble is that the Georgians aren’t as good when it comes to defense. In fact, with 28 goals conceded in 16 games, Atlanta has the second-worst defense in the entire league.</p>
<p>This is why we think LAFC will win this game. Cherundolo’s players should be able to score at least one goal more than the opposition.</p>
<p>Pick: LAFC to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
