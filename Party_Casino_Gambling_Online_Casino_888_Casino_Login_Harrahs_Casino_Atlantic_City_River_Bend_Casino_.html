<p>Affinity Gaming, the owner of the Silver Sevens Casino in Las Vegas, is merging with a newly formed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). It plans to pursue addition consolidation opportunities following that marriage.</p>

<p>In a Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released Friday, Gaming &amp; Hospitality Acquisition Corp. revealed plans for an initial public offering (IPO) raising $150 million to $172.5 million. The new SPAC said in the S-1 its initial business combination will be with Affinity. But the activity won’t end there.</p>
<p>We seek to acquire one or more businesses with assets that are fundamentally sound, yet are underperforming their potential,” according to the S-1. “We will look for opportunities where we can leverage our significant experience and expertise to help one or more businesses achieve long-term strategic and operational excellence.”</p>
<p>As is par for the course with SPAC IPO filings, the Gaming &amp; Hospitality document indicates the blank-check firm hasn’t yet identified a merger partner beyond Affinity. The company says its search for targets won’t be confined by geography, and that it’s focusing on gaming and hospitality assets.</p>
<p>Regional Focus Likely</p>
<p>With regional gaming venues proving sturdy relative to destination market counterparts against the coronavirus backdrop, Gaming &amp; Hospitality could make that a focus of its merger search.</p>
<p>“In particular, we believe there is a robust addressable market in regional and distributed gaming. Regional gaming is a logical market, given the potential synergies with the Affinity Gaming platform,” according to the SEC filing.</p>
<p>In addition to Silver Sevens, Affinity owns Buffalo Bill’s, Rail City Casino, and Primm Valley Resort &amp; Casino in Nevada. It also owns the Lakeside Hotel Casino in Iowa and the Mark Twain Casino and St. Jo Frontier Casino in Missouri.</p>
<p>The blank-check outfit also notes deals in the distributed gaming, gaming equipment, online casinos, and sports betting industries are possible. Gaming &amp; Hospitality sees a favorable environment for consolidation, owing to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“The market dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, together with a fragmented market with few consolidators, will provide a broad range of acquisition opportunities,” the SPAC said in the S-1.</p>
<p>No Stopping SPAC Fever</p>
<p>After taking the investment community by storm last year, blank-check companies are extending that momentum in 2021. The gaming industry remains hospitable territory for confirmed deals and SPAC speculation.</p>
<p>To this point in the new year, four SPAC mergers closed across various industries, according to SPAC Track data. As of Jan. 9, there were 27 blank-check IPOs that raised a combined $6.6 billion. That offering number is likely approaching 40 or more today.</p>
<p>In addition to its Nevada, Iowa, and Missouri permits, Affinity has a license to operate in Florida, and previously held licenses in eight states, including Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Mississippi, Indiana, Louisiana, and Arizona.</p>
<p>“Potential target companies who are licensed will likely view our existing and previous licensure favorably when seeking to transact, as it likely reduces transaction execution risk,” according to the S-1.</p>
