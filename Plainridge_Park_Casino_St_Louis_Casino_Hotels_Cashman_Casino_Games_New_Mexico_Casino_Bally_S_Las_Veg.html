<p>BetMGM Sportsbook is making another move on golf and is now offering future markets on the FedExCup. It’s an important step forward for sports betting in the United States, as future markets on the FedExCup have been missing so far, prompting some golf fans to seek alternatives in unregulated markets. No more. BetMGM is happy to list Rory McIlroy as the favorite to win the new season, which will make him the first player to have won the event back-to-back.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy Listed as Favorite for Upcoming Season</p>
<p>The markets at BetMGM will be available between tournaments and McIlroy is presently topping the market at +700 to win his fourth title, and also become a repeat champion. BetMGM’s first-mover initiative is interesting, and it may galvanize other sportsbooks to follow the example and list FedExCup futures.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there is plenty of action going down on golf. While the vertical is not the biggest money-maker for sportsbooks, it definitely can be, as more companies are exploring the option of expanding their golf coverage, first among them BetMGM.</p>
<p>Company head of partnerships Kyle Wachtel welcomed the tie-up and said that the partnership with PGA was focused on innovation. He added that the company was tremendously happy to be working on and offering future markets and overall good coverage of golf events. Wachtel added:</p>
<p>Through BetMGM, golf fans can now add even more excitement to the race for the Tour Championship, where our favorite golfers will compete for the event’s largest prize purse ever. Company head of partnerships Kyle Wachtel</p>
<p>Golf Becomes More Important Vertical for Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by Tour Championship VP of gaming, Scott Warfield, who said that it was exciting to see BetMGM join in and seek to boost fan engagement and provide sports bettors with new opportunities. All of this leads to a unique betting experience, Warfield added.</p>
<p>FanDuel has already got in on the golf betting action with a dedicated golf ad that features Jordan Spieth, a famed golfer. FanDuel does not offer future markets on the FedExCup though.</p>
