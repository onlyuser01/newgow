    <h1>Cherokee Casino Wind Creek Casino Bethlehem Ballys Casino Nj Katsubet Casino The Casinos Tyson Fury</h1>

<p>Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte lock horns in what might be the greatest boxing fight of the year. The two heavyweights meet at London’s Wembley Stadium on Saturday, April 23, when Tyson Fury will try to defend his WBC and The Ring titles against fellow Brit, Dillian Whyte.</p>
<p>About 100,000 people will come to the UK’s biggest stadium this Saturday to witness the boxing Battle of Britain. Whyte challenges the world title for the first time ever, but oddsmakers don’t think he’s going to succeed. Instead, they believe Fury is likely to win his 31st bout.</p>
<p>Tyson Fury vs Dillian Whyte Odds</p>
<p>All odds are as of April 22.</p>
<p>Moneyline</p>
<p>Tyson Fury -500 Dillian Whyte +350</p>
<p>Where and When to Watch</p>

<p>Tyson Fury’s Final Fight?</p>
<p>There are rumors that the Gypsy King might decide to retire after this fight. Of course, only if he wins. If that does happen, he’d have the luxury to retire as an undefeated champion of the world.</p>
<p>That said, winning on Saturday is a must for the 33-year-old. Everyone knows what he’s capable of, the only worry is that he might have become overconfident after knocking out Deontay Wilder twice in the previous two fights.</p>
<p>In the first press conference ahead of the Fury-Whyte fight, Tyson promised this is going to be an easy win, saying that the fight “is going to be a Ferrari racing a Vauxhall Corsa”.</p>
<p>Can Dillian Whyte Cause a Sensation?</p>
<p>If Whyte gets a win on Saturday, it’s going to be one of the greatest upsets in the history of the sport. He does have an impressive record, but he’s nowhere near Fury. So far, he’s won 28 bouts, while losing two.</p>
<p>The only two fighters that have defeated Whyte are Anthony Joshua and Alexander Povetkin. It was August 2020 when Povetkin beat him by technical knockout, taking the WBC interim title away from him. Whyte got it back in March 2021 with a TKO win over Povetkin.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for Whyte’s biggest challenge of his career. So, can the underdog become the world champion?</p>
<p>Tyson Fury vs Dillian Whyte Prediction</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise that sportsbooks are giving just -500 on Tyson Fury winning this Saturday. After all, he’s one of the greatest heavyweight boxers in history, if not the greatest. The Gypsy King has already defeated many high-profile pugilists, so beating Whyte shouldn’t be a major problem for the guy.</p>
<p>Still, surprises do happen in boxing, especially when two knockout artists are pitted together. As Whyte’s knockout-to-win ratio is 68%, we could see him dropping Fury to the floor. But then again, the Bronze Bomber did it to no avail – Fury got back in the fight.</p>
<p>That said, it’s possible this is going to be a very exciting fight, but we should see Fury triumph in the end.</p>
<p>Pick: Tyson Fury to win by decision</p>
