<p>Marketa Vondrousova and Ons Jabeur go toe to toe in a battle for the 2023 Wimbledon trophy. The Women’s Singles final is on the program on Saturday, July 15</p>
<p>Marketa Vondrousova is the first-ever unseeded player to get to the Wimbledon final, which is one of the reasons why she’s expected to lose to Ons Jabeur on Saturday. However, this tournament has already seen a number of upsets, so another one happening in the final wouldn’t seem too crazy. This goes especially considering that Vondrousova has already defeated Jabeur twice this year.</p>
<p>Marketa Vondrousova vs. Ons Jabeur Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Marketa Vondrousova +188 Ons Jabeur -227</p>
<p>*Odds taken from bet365 on Friday, July 14, 2023.</p>

<p>Marketa Vondrousova Playing the Best Tennis of Her Career</p>
<p>In 2023, the Czech player has already played 40 matches, winning 30 of those. In comparison, Vondrousova played just 28 matches last year, none of which were on grass. This year, however, she’s already played nine matches on the grass court, winning eight of them.</p>
<p>Six of those wins happened at the 2023 Wimbledon, in which she’s had a difficult job right from the start. Excluding her first opponent – Peyton Stearns who’s 59th in the WTA Rankings – all of her 2023 Wimbledon rivals so far were players from the top 40.</p>
<p>The highest-ranked player she’s defeated so far is Jessica Pegula, who was fourth in the rankings ahead of the British Grand Slam.</p>
<p>Ons Jabeur’s Confidence is Sky-High</p>
<p>Jabeur was a +138 underdog in the semifinal match against Aryna Sabalenka. Her odds moved against her even more after she lost the first set to the WTA No. 2. However, the Tunisian then staged a huge upset, winning the next two sets.</p>
<p>Something similar happened in the quarterfinal of the 2023 WTA Wimbledon against Elena Rybakina. In that match too, Jabeur lost the first set but then went on to dominate the next two. And we saw the same thing happen in round 3 against Bianca Andreescu.</p>
<p>All these facts show that Jabeur is a player who never gives up, but the question is whether playing three sets in three matches of the 2023 Wimbledon has affected her fitness.</p>
<p>Marketa Vondrousova vs. Ons Jabeur Prediction</p>
<p>Marketa Vondrousova probably has more energy than Ons Jabeur who spent more than an hour longer on the field than her in the semifinal. However, the stakes are high, so the Tunisian player won’t care about tiredness on Saturday.</p>
<p>Instead, she’s gonna give everything she’s got to win the Wimbledon trophy, which she came very close to winning last year – she reached the 2022 final but lost to Elena Rybakina. In 2023, she won’t let Marketa Vondrousova do the same to her.</p>
<p>Pick: Ons Jabeur to win</p>
