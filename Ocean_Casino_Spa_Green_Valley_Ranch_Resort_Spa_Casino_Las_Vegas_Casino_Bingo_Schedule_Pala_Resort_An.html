Players are drawn in by the vibrant slot machine with neon colors and eye-grabbing symbols representing good luck. The symbols range from clovers, cherries, bells, fruits that twinkle, and bells. When forming a winning combination, players see it buried in flames, just about to burst into a shower of coins on the screen.</p>
<p>The new slot also features wild symbols that only make an appearance on the second, third, and fourth reels. Wilds replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of scatters. When a winning combo includes wilds, it expands to cover all positions on the respective reel.</p>
<p>Scatters can form winning combos no matter what their position on the reels might be. The</p>
<p>Diamond Scatter can show up anywhere on the reels, while the Star Scatter symbol can pop up on the first, third, and fifth reels.</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots to Make Your Jaws Drop</p>
<p>Burning Aces. Jackpot uses the studio’s Spinential engine that can trigger 10 times faster loading speeds while offering an improved user interface, a mobile bar for tracking players’ gaming history, and an auto spin feature.</p>
<p>The game also encompasses progressive jackpot games. The progressive jackpots are accumulating extra prizes nonstop while fueled by a percentage of players’ wagers. The game counts four different types of progressive jackpots: mini, minor, major, and epic.</p>
<p>Every jackpot game level is presented in the form of a card suit, ranging from diamonds for the first level, clubs for the second level, hearts for the third level, and spades for the fourth level. Once a game is completed and the player has finished gathering the winnings, the jackpot game can be triggered randomly. The greater players’ qualifying bets during the base game, the higher the odds of landing a Jackpot game and collecting one of the fourth available jackpots.</p>
<p>Evoplay’s chief executive officer Ivan Kravchuk spoke about the new game, expressing the studio’s excitement to “offer another fantastic slot” to their loyal player base. In mid-July,</p>
<p>Evoplay sealed a deal with Gaming Innovation Group. The previous month, the company announced a similar partnership with Fortuna Entertainment Group.</p>
