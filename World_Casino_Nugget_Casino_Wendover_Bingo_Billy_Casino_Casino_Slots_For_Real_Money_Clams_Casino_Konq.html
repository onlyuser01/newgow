    <h1>World Casino Nugget Casino Wendover Bingo Billy Casino Casino Slots For Real Money Clams Casino Konq</h1>

<p>This strategic partnership aims to bring a slew of exhilarating titles to the North American iGaming market</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming Inc., a prominent developer and distributor of casino table games and technology, has entered into a licensing agreement with Konquer, a relatively new player in the industry.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming CEO Todd Cravens Excited as Konquer Takes Galaxy Titles Online</p>
<p>Under this agreement, Konquer, founded by former DraftKings employees Ashford Kneitel and Aditya Singh, will take the reins in developing and delivering Galaxy Gaming’s popular titles, including Daredevil Poker, Emperor’s Challenge Exposed, High Card Flush, and High Hand Blackjack, to eager online gamers across North America.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming’s President and CEO, Todd Cravens, expressed his enthusiasm for this venture, stating:</p>
<p>We’re delighted to see some of our most exciting titles and progressives be developed for the North American iGaming market by the Konquer team. This is the first time Daredevil, Emperor’s Challenge Exposed, and High Card Flush will be live online, and we can’t wait to engage and delight players with this proven content. Todd Cravens, president &amp; CEO, Galaxy Gaming</p>
<p>Konquer, though a newcomer to the scene, has already made an impression with its experienced team of founders, both of whom previously played key roles in the creation of popular casino games at DraftKings. Ashford Kneitel, Konquer’s CEO, and Aditya Singh, the company’s CTO, are committed to delivering innovative and immersive gaming experiences.</p>
<p>Konquer Makes Big Moves with Oddsworks Partnership and Galaxy Gaming Success</p>
<p>This collaboration is not Konquer‘s first major deal, as the company recently signed another significant agreement with Oddsworks shortly after its official launch. Under this arrangement, Konquer will provide Oddsworks with a continuous stream of casino games, with plans to release several games annually throughout the multi-year partnership.</p>
<p>For Galaxy Gaming, this venture with Konquer comes on the heels of an impressive Q2 revenue report, which saw their revenue climb to $7.5 million, marking their highest figure since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In May, Galaxy Gaming also extended its partnership with Evolution by ten years, allowing it to expand its presence and offer Evolution’s collection of online table games to a broader audience. Galaxy Gaming benefits from Evolution’s diverse game selection, and both companies expressed excitement about the continued collaboration’s success.</p>
<p>May also saw Galaxy Gaming launch its Galaxy Operating System (GOS), a next-generation game management system that introduces innovative progressive jackpot options, LED sensors, and digital tracking. GOS provides a dynamic and scalable operating system for the casino industry, offering operators the ability to run multiple jackpots on various table games and supporting multi-game, tier, and denomination progressive options.</p>
