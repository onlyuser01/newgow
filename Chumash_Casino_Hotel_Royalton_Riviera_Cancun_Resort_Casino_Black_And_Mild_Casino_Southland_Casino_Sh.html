<p>Undead Fortune review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Undead Fortune is no ordinary ancient Egyptian slot, swapping golden artifacts and desert sun for an eerie occult world.</p>
<p>In this ghoulish realm, mummies come back to life as a supernatural snake snarls. The gods and goddesses of Undead Fortune are more spooky than glamorous, though their powers should never be doubted.</p>
<p>This slot is ideal for players looking for a horror-twist on an Egyptian mythology theme.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Ominous string notes add tension and a Middle Eastern feel to the soundtrack. Ambient sounds of a snake hissing amp up the drama further, making it clear that peril is close at hand.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from stone carved with hieroglyphics, suggesting an ancient temple. The symbols tumble into the reels on heavily cracked stone blocks, emphasizing the age of the setting.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will see skeletal pharaohs with glowing eyes, half-unwrapped mummies, and the cat-headed goddess, Bastet. Her feline eyes gleam with macabre intentions and players would do well to watch their step around her.</p>
<p>The star of Undead Fortune is arguably the enormous snake winding himself around the reels. Fangs bared, this formidable cobra looks ready to strike at any moment. The chamber beyond the snake gleams sickly yellow, creating the sense of an underworld.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack combine to create a unique atmosphere of ancient Egyptian horror.</p>
<p>Epic win in the bonus feature</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Undead Fortune is a five-reel, four-row slot with 10 winlines.</p>
<p>The maximum win for Undead Fortune is 10,000x players’ total bet.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Bonus.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols.</p>
<p>The Walking Duels feature is triggered when players land the VS Walk symbol. Players will be shown a monster that they must fight and if the duel is won, a multiplier is applied to all win lines connected to the duel. The potential multipliers range from 2x to 200x the player’s bet.</p>
<p>VS Walk symbol stays in the game whenever monster lost its duel against the player</p>
<p>Winning a duel also awards a respin to the player, and the duel will move across the reels to the left until reaching the edge of the reels or another duel. If the duel is not won, the duel is removed from the reels.</p>
<p>If players land the green VS Expand symbol on reels 2, 3, 4 or 5, the Expanding Duel feature begins. The Expanding Duels are Wild and show a multiplier that is saved if the monster is defeated. Next, the Expanding Duel begins to expand to the left and a new monster duel is triggered. The process then starts again.</p>
<p>Epic VS symbol can boost player's winnings significantly</p>
<p>As with the Walking Duels feature, the Expanding Duels offer possible multipliers between 2x and 200x. The feature concludes if the monster wins or if the Expanding Duel cannot grow any farther.</p>
<p>Both Curse symbols and Tomb symbols can transform into Wilds if they are included in a winning combination, or when they are part of triggering a bonus feature.</p>
<p>The Curse bonus begins when players land 3 Curse Scatter symbols. This feature begins with 10 free spins and increased odds of VS Expand symbols and VS Walk symbols appearing.</p>
<p>The Tomb Bonus begins when players land 3 Tomb Scatter symbols and features locking reels. During this feature, Tomb VS symbols, Epic VS symbols, Unlock symbols, and Golden Unlock symbols appear along with non-paying symbols. Each of the special symbols has unique features, including the ability to unlock locked reels.</p>
<p>The Tomb Bonus is one of the main bonus features of the game</p>
<p>The Tomb Bonus is played on special reels with a multiplier above each reel. The feature continues until all of the reels have been locked simultaneously.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.29%, just above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Undead Fortune slot</p>
<p>The volatility of Undead Fortune is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Egyptian horror-themed slot.</p>
<p>Players in a spooky mood will love Undead Fortune’s dark front end, while players with a mathematical mindset will appreciate the combination of solid RTP and robust volatility.</p>
<p>The various bonus features ensure that the gameplay stays fun and engaging.</p>
