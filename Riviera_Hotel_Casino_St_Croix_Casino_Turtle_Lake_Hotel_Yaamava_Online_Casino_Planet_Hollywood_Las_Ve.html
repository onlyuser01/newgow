    <h1>Riviera Hotel Casino St Croix Casino Turtle Lake Hotel Yaamava Online Casino Planet Hollywood Las Ve</h1>

<p>One of the world’s largest integrated gaming conglomerates NOVOMATIC Americas has signed a multi-year distribution agreement with one of Canada’s most prestigious distributors, R2 Gaming Inc. According to the deal, the famous supplier will provide Novomatic Americas’ complete plethora of casino options to Canadian players. The portfolio features slots, sports betting, player redemption kiosks, and electronic table games.</p>
<p>NOVOMATIC Americas Pleased to Work With the Reputable Canadian Distributor</p>
<p>Fully dedicated to supporting its customer base worldwide since its launch in 2012, Austria-based NOVOMATIC Americas is busy running subsidiaries in around 50 countries and over 2,000 gaming facilities worldwide with help from 24,000 employees. The company offers state-of-the-art gaming gear and product support fully focused on customers and their success.</p>
<p>Some of their most important products are their Money Party Link slots, electronic table games like Novo Unity II, their player redemption kiosks, and the ActionBook sports betting products.</p>
<p>Now, all of them and more will be distributed all across Canada. Novomatic Americas’ president and chief executive officer Rick Meitzler expressed his delight in joining one of the best gaming distributors in the country in a multi-year partnership. He added that working together with R2 Gaming will trigger “tremendous potential” in all of the supplier’s markets, thus aligning with its growth plans in the Canadian retail sector.</p>
<p>Meitzler expressed the company’s eagerness to start exploring all the upcoming opportunities while offering the Canadian base of players “exceptional entertainment experiences” that have made them world-famous. Last March, NOVOMATIC America’s and Playtech sealed a similarly important partnership deal.</p>
<p>R2 Gaming’s co-founders Rocco DiPaola and Ravi Sharma expressed similar views of excitement regarding the new partnership which they called a strategic one. They both expect the mix between NOVOMATIC Americas’ premier products recognized globally and R2 Gaming’s own top customer services and support models to have a positive impact on Canadian operators. At the same time, the deal will boost NOVOMATIC Americas’ presence in the regulated Canadian market, especially thanks to the shared customer-focused policy that the two companies have in common. R2 Gaming is anticipating a long-term partnership that will equally benefit the two parties.</p>
<p>Where Will NOVOMATIC America’s Content Become Available?</p>
<p>According to the deal, NOVOMATIC Americas’ top gaming content will be mainly available on a number of hardware platforms belonging to R2 Gaming, including the V.I.P. Lounge Curve 1.43, the Panthera Curve 1.43, and the Novostar V.I.P. Royal 2.65.</p>
<p>The list of products will include 80+ slots like Dancing Lantern or Dancing Tiger, along with NOVOMATIC Electronic Poker featuring games like Caribbean Poker, 3-Card Poker, or Texas Hold‘em Poker in a variety of electronic variants: Novo TouchBet 3-Card Poker, Novo TouchBet Caribbean Poker, Novo Flying 3-Card Poker, and others. NOVOMATIC will also make its Electronic Roulette products available, including Novo TouchBet Live-Roulette and Novo Multi-Roulette. Baccarat, Sic Bo, Blacjack and NOVOMATIC Actionbook sports betting will also be distributed to Canadians.</p>
