<p>The leading gaming, sports betting and interactive entertainment company, Entain, released its 2022-23 ESG report, outlining the progress on strategic ESG-related objectives and issues. The company reminded that its two prime ongoing goals include growth and sustainability.</p>
<p>Within its recent report, Entain confirmed the significant progress it made within different ESG objectives including safer betting and gaming and focusing on regulated markets. Additionally, the company focused on investing in people and communities, while at the same time pursuing the highest standards of corporate governance.</p>
<p>The release of the latest ESG report comes after in 2022, the company became the biggest operator in the world to secure Advanced Level 3 accreditation for its online activities, as well as Advanced Level 2 accreditation for its land-based operations from GamCare’s Safer Gambling Standard. Further recognizing the company’s efforts, SBC named Entain as the 2022 Socially Responsible Operator of the Year.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, we have continued to make great progress in setting the standards for our industry in all areas of ESG, across all of our operations.“ Jette Nygaard-Andersen, CEO at Entain</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, Entain’s CEO, commented on the topic explaining that in the last year, the company made significant progress within different ESG segments. She pointed out: “We are proud to lead the industry in providing the safest possible betting and gaming platform, taking a leading role in supporting the communities in which we operate, reducing or environmental impact and in doing so, making Entain the best place to work for all of our people.” Finally, Nygaard-Andersen spoke about the benefits those processes delivered for the company’s stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Company Highlights Multiple ESG Achievements</p>
<p>Highlighting the achievements within the ESG vertical, Entain said that 33% of its Board is female. Additionally, recently the company introduced its first-ever Board Diversity Policy. Entain added that it gained further progress on closing the gender gap pay, while at the same time delivering support and wellbeing programs for its employees, especially the ones impacted by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Within its new ESG report, the company reminded that it introduced its ARC player protection program to 22 international markets outside of the UK. Moreover, in the last year, the gaming and entertainment leader increased its contributions dedicated to Research Education and Treatment in 2023 to 1% of GGY.</p>
<p>Other highlights described by Entain reveal that 100% of the company’s revenue was derived from regulated or domestically regulated markets. To ensure sustainable growth, the company exited a number of markets that weren’t likely to be regulated. Last but not least, Entain confirmed that it has licenses for 26 North American markets and 30 countries around the globe.</p>
