<p>Aristocrat Leisure Limited’s recent announcement revealed details regarding the $1.2 billion deal and the company’s plans to implement the new technology within its existing offerings. NeoGames’ real money gaming (RMG) solutions showed significant potential to bolster Aristocrat’s market appeal across multiple jurisdictions. The global supplier’s stellar 2022 financials place it in the perfect position to seek additional strategic acquisitions.</p>
<p>The Deal Is a Natural Progression of Aristocrat’s Strategy</p>
<p>The $1.2 billion acquisition comes as no surprise to industry insiders. In January, Fitch Ratings evaluated the creditworthiness of Aristocrat Leisure, concluding that the company was primed for new M&amp;A Deals within the following 12 months. The supplier’s outstanding financials and continued investments in technology, products, and innovations make the NeoGames acquisition a natural next step.</p>
<p>While details regarding the deal are unknown, Aristocrat shared it would complete the acquisition via an ASX filing. The company will obtain 100% of NeoGames at a cash price of $29.50 per share, totaling $1.2 billion. Aristocrat managing director and CEO Trevor Croker noted the deal perfectly aligned with the company’s strategy and commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>We remain focused on executing our proven growth strategy and creating long-term value for Aristocrat shareholders. Trevor Croker, Aristocrat managing director and CEO</p>
<p>Thanks to the deal, Aristocrat will significantly bolster its global footprint. Acquiring NeoGames will be instrumental in cementing the supplier’s position in the US market and expanding its reach in Europe and other key markets. Naturally, Aristocrat will also gain access to cutting-edge proprietary technology, facilitating the supplier’s shift to the digital space.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Specifically Seeks RMG Integration</p>
<p>NeoGames is a thriving company with a proven track record, excelling in the iGaming iLottery, and Online Sports Betting space. Aristocrat specifically expressed interest in the developer’s industry-leading RMG solutions, hoping to integrate them with existing offerings. The existing inter-company synergies should help reduce long-term expenses and aid overall scalability.</p>
<p>Such a landmark acquisition will be instrumental in maintaining Aristocrat’s dominant position as a leading supplier. The company’s continued focus on RMG solutions, including the recent takeover of B2B RMG supplier Roxor, indicates its ongoing efforts to bolster its existing digital capabilities and provide a complete solution for its partners in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>This transaction will deliver on our strategy by providing a portfolio of end-to-end solutions for iGaming, iLottery, and Online Sports Betting operators globally. Trevor Croker, Aristocrat managing director and CEO</p>
<p>The NeoGames acquisition is another significant accomplishment for Aristocrat as it consolidates its market presence and leverages its excellent financials to obtain vital new technology. After its two high-profile acquisitions in H1, the leading supplier will likely seek more takeover opportunities. Despite their high costs, such deals will be instrumental in maintaining an edge in the current highly competitive market.</p>
