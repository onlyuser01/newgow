<p>Kronos Review</p>
<p>Kronos is a video slot coming from WMS. If you’re a fan of the video slots coming from this provider you will surely notice that Kronos is in fact a sequel of the mega popular Zeus slot.</p>
<p>The slot comes with a medium to high variance and can produce big payouts, but you will need to be persistent and a bit lucky to see them coming your way. If you’re in it for the long haul and aiming to win big, Kronos might just be the game for you.</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>As its predecessor Kronos has a Greek mythology theme. Kronos was the youngest of the titans and father to some of the most powerful Greek gods including Zeus, Poseidon, Hera and Hades.</p>
<p>The visual details in the game are decent and the slot has a vintage appearance. This flows perfectly with the game theme giving the slot an attractive look.</p>
<p>You can pick between 1 and 20 paylines</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay in Kronos is quite exciting as you wait for those three Scatters to land and take you to the bonus round. But players can also score great payouts during base play thanks to the stacked symbols. This makes Kronos an exciting slot and a game worth playing.</p>
<p>Bet size and payouts</p>
<p>If you decide to play the game you will need to bet anywhere from $0.20 up to $60 per spin. The Wild and Scatter symbols don’t offer any payouts, so the biggest wins in the game can come from the Kronos symbol. If you land 5 of them on a winning payline you will be awarded with a payout of 37,5 times the total stake.</p>
<p>You also have a chance to land a full screen of Kronos symbols and walk away with a payout of 750 times the total stake. This is a high variance game with an RTP value of 95.94%.</p>

<p>Bonus features</p>
<p>All of the game symbols in Kronos, except for the Scatter, can land stacked across the reels. This is why players can score big payouts even during base play.</p>
<p>The biggest excitement in the slot comes from the Kronos symbol. It can award payouts by creating winning combinations starting from both right to left and left to right. This makes the gameplay more exciting and lucrative at the same time.</p>
<p>Special Symbol of Kronos slot - only symbol in the game that pays from both left-to-right and right-to-left</p>
<p>The Wild symbol in the game can land only on reels 2, 3 and 4, contributing to bigger payouts.</p>
<p>The game comes with a free spins bonus which is triggered by landing 3, 4 or 5 Scatters anywhere on the reels. In return the player will get 10, 25 or whopping 100 free spins accordingly.</p>
<p>The free spins can be re-triggered indefinitely by landing 3 or more Scatters during the feature. The same rules apply in the free spins bonus as in base play. Still the Stacked Wilds and the Stacked Kronos symbols tend to land more often in the free spins bonus, so players can easily get wins of up to 750 times the total stake in one or more spins.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Kronos is a powerful WMS slot which is not for the faint hearted player. The game has a simple bonus round with no extra features than in base play, but players can win up to 100 free spins and re-trigger the bonus an unlimited number of times.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to get a big number of free spins all you need to do is pray that Kronos appears in full length on all of the reels.</p>
