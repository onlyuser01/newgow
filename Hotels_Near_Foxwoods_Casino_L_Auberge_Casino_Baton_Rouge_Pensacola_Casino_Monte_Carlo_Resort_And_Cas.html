<p>The prominent operator of casino products is sallying forth with bespoke content with the latest opportunity realized with the help of Hacksaw Gaming</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming and William Hill have created a branded version of the popular Mines games that will be available exclusively at the operator and bear the signage, IP, and “unmistakable bold branding” of the prominent casino operator.</p>
<p>Players in Control for an Even Better Experience</p>
<p>William Hill has also taken this opportunity to give players more control over their gameplay and help them adjust the size of the grid along with the bet for a truly upgraded arcade feel. Just like in the classic game, players would need to uncover Diamond symbols while trying to not come across a Bomb symbol.</p>
<p>Every Diamond symbol that is successfully revealed will significantly increase the payout potential. This is the latest of a three-part game series that already features the Boxes and Coins games, which have proved true blockbusters over the past year.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming introduced this bespoke experience as part of its Dare2Win portfolio which seeks to revamp traditional gaming experiences and make them suitable for modern gaming audiences. William Hill will benefit from this opportunity as it seeks to strengthen its presence in the online casino vertical and deliver the best experience for modern players.</p>
<p>Showcasing Hacksaw’s True Potential</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming CCO Gabrielle Star was confident that this opportunity would allow the company to showcase its development nous and prowess once again. Star was happy to celebrate another milestone achievement with the release of Mines as well. She added:</p>
<p>Our designers did a brilliant job incorporating William Hill’s iconic branding into the game, offering a more straightforward vintage style of gameplay which has entertained casino fans for decades. Hacksaw Gaming CCO Gabrielle Star</p>
<p>All of this comes as part of the company’s ambition to expand its Dare2Win range and reach bigger audiences. William Hill global gaming content delivery manager Keiron Downs was of a similar mind. Downs welcomed the new product and said that it was a fantastic opportunity to offer alternative gaming experiences to players. “Really looking forward to what the future holds,” Downs concluded.</p>
