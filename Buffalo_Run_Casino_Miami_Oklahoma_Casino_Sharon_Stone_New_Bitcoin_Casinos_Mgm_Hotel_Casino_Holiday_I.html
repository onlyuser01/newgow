<p>Inter Miami welcomes Austin FC on Saturday, July 1 at DRV PNK Stadium, which is the place where 80% of their wins in the 2023 MLS happened</p>
<p>Inter Miami lost each of its last seven games in the MLS, but there’s still hope for the team that will have Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets on the roster in about a month. But until then, “The Herons” are left to their own devices, meaning that they’re going to have a hard time against Austin FC on Saturday, July 1.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Austin FC Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Inter Miami +138 Draw +250 Austin FC +175</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 3.5 +175 Under 3.5 -250</p>
<p>*Odds taken from bet365 on Thursday, June 29, 2023.</p>
<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Place : DRV PNK Stadium in Miami, Florida</p>
<p>: DRV PNK Stadium in Miami, Florida Date : Saturday, July 1, 2023</p>
<p>: Saturday, July 1, 2023 Time : 7:30 PM ET</p>

<p>Inter Miami Can’t Wait for Messi &amp; Co.</p>
<p>“The Herons” have played 18 games in the 2023 MLS season, meaning that they’ve got another 16 games left. They’re trailing by nine points behind the two closest teams from the playoff zone, but the good news is that those two have played at least one game more than them.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Inter Miami’s recent run doesn’t suggest they’re going to be able to catch up with those teams. At least not before Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets arrive in Florida, who are expected to make their MLS debut in August. David Beckham-owned team is 5-0-13 right now with seven straight losses.</p>

<p>They’re probably very motivated to end their losing run, but winning points against Austin FC won’t be easy. It’s not just because “The Herons” are completely out of shape; it’s also because they will miss a couple of key men this Saturday.</p>
<p>Captain Gregore remains injured, and the same goes for his fellow Brazilian, Jean Mota. Corentin Jean is also injured, while DeAndre Yedlin will miss the Austin FC game because of international duties (he’s out with the USMNT at the 2023 Gold Cup).</p>
<p>Austin FC Looking Great Offensively</p>
<p>Austin FC is sitting in the No. 8 position in the Western Conference of the 2023 MLS with 25 points in 19 games (7-4-8 record). The reason why the boys from Texas aren’t even higher is that their defense has been very leaky this season. With 27 goals conceded so far, they’re among the worst in the league.</p>
<p>However, their offense is among the best. So far, they’ve scored 24 goals in total, or 1.29 goals per game. Their average, however, is even better if you take a look at their recent couple of games. In the last five MLS rounds, it’s 2.0 goals per game.</p>
<p>“Los Verdes” attackers have been playing as a team, the evidence being that eight of the nine players from their attacking department have scored at least a goal. Gyasi Zardes and Jon Gallagher lead the way with five goals each, closely followed by Sebastian Driussi with four goals to his name.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Austin FC Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are horrible at the back, but Austin FC compensates for poor defending with amazing attacking output. That said, we think the Texans will have no trouble scoring once again. But what about Inter Miami?</p>
<p>It’s high time for Beckham’s team to do better in the attack and this might be the game when they do it. We think they’re going to score, although not necessarily enough to win. Still, we think there’s a very good chance they’re gonna be able to snatch a point in this game, thus (finally) ending their losing run.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami and Austin FC to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
