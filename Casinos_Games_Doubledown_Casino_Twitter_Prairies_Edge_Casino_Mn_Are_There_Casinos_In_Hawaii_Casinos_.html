<p>Loto-Québec, а Canadian lottery operator, has posted a new report, detailing the benefits of online casino and lottery. The digital vertical significantly contributed to the company’s revenues during the first half of the 2022-23 financial year, the company announced.</p>
<p>Loto-Québec Posted Its FT 2022-23 Results</p>
<p>As reported by the Canadian lottery giant, the company’s total revenue for the April-September period had a remarkable increase of 35.4%. In just six months, Loto-Québec reported record-breaking revenue of $1.07 billion (in USD, current conversion rates). The lottery company also announced that its consolidated net income reached $589.3 million for the period, representing an impressive 37.9% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Loto-Québec pointed out that the dramatic year-on-year difference is in part because the previous financial year saw the company halt its activities a few times because of COVID-19. When comparing the lottery corporation’s revenue and net income to the pre-pandemic levels, we see that these metrics increased by 3.5% and 9.4% respectively. In short, Loto-Québec not only recovered from the pandemic but surpassed the pre-pandemic results.</p>
<p>Despite everything, the overall lottery revenue actually declined by 5.8% over the same period during FY 2021-22 because of of lower Lotto 6/49 and Lotto Max sales.</p>
<p>Finally, Loto-Québec reported that the cost-to-revenue ratio improved from 31% to 27.9% which shows that the crown corporation is now better at managing its resources. The company attributed this improvement to its robust efforts to control its costs.</p>
<p>Online Sales Skyrocketed</p>
<p>While Loto-Québec’s post-COVID recovery is nothing short of impressive, the aforementioned metrics would not have been possible without the company’s online vertical. Online lottery sales accounted for 12.7% of the total lottery revenue, the corporation reported. While this may seem rather low compared to other more online-oriented brands, it represents a whopping 273% increase from the pre-pandemic period when only 3.4% of the lottery revenue came from the digital segment.</p>
<p>Likewise, online casino sales now accounted for 23.8% of the total casino revenue, representing a huge increase from the 8.9% recorded before COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>Loto-Québec – Enthusiastic yet Cautious</p>
<p>Loto-Québec’s chief executive officer, Jean-François Bergeron, applauded the results, praising the company for meeting and exceeding its budget target. He praised everyone at the company for their efforts, saying that the record-breaking results would not have been possible without the Loto-Québec team’s excellent work. Bergeron emphasized that personally, he is very satisfied with the company’s performance.</p>
<p>Despite the favorable metrics, the CEO noted that Loto-Québec remains wary of the economic headwinds. The company acknowledges that many of its peers are struggling because of the macroeconomic situation and the rising costs of energy. While Loto-Québec is very enthusiastic about its success, the company will remain cautious moving forward.</p>
<p>Bergeron concluded that the crown corporation will continue to reposition its brand in order to maintain its success.</p>
