    <h1>Chanced Social Casino Login Florida Casino Map Four Winds Casino South Bend Photos Casino En Oklahom</h1>

<p>Hello, it’s been over 1 year now since 1xbet blocked my account with 27,000,000 F (about USD 45,000). Account ID: 370930595</p>
<p>I’ve checked online and seen lots of users with this problem. Noticed 1xbet responds claiming their rule 2.26 on multi-accounting has been violated by the user and refunds their deposit. I don’t have multiple accounts and wonder why after following all their KYC instructions and sending all required documentation for over 1 year now, they haven’t unblocked my account and refunded my deposit. Are they trying to defraud me?</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of all the verification process they’ve done so far:</p>
<p>06/01/22: I tried to make a withdrawal from my account and noticed it’s blocked. They ask me to send basic verification documents (photo of ID, photo of me holding ID and phone with mail from their security team, screenshots of cryptocurrency account used to make deposit, history of account and account details, etc)</p>
<p>11/01/22: My account is blocked and i’m asked to submit an appeal claim</p>
<p>07/03/22: They ask me to send by postal service: notarized copy of my national ID, screenshots of my cryptocurrency account and a copy of my bank statement to their address at P.O Box 856, Lviv, Ukraine, 79008. Note that the war in Ukraine had just started making it very difficult and expensive to send documents by post. I however sent the documents and notified them.</p>
<p>19/09/22: 1xbet says the are looking at the documents</p>
<p>30/10/22: They ask me to complete a questionnaire with questions on if I modified documents that were sent to them (I didn’t) and also which device I used to get screenshots of what I sent.</p>
<p>06/12/22: They ask me to take a picture holding a code they shared with me and upload.</p>
<p>11/12/22: I’m asked to do a skype video call with them. It’s done and I received a mail saying I passed the skype verification.</p>
<p>16/12/22: I’m asked to fill a very long questionnaire with questions like what’s my favorite sport, my gender, nationality, if someone influenced my betting strategy, etc.</p>
<p>19/12/22: I’m asked to download a questionnaire with the same questions asked above, fill it out by hand and send to their address P.O Box 856, Lviv, Ukraine 79008</p>
<p>24/12/22: I’m asked to do another skype video call with them. It’s done and I receive another mail saying I passed the skype verification.</p>
<p>27/12/22: I’m asked to upload a copy of my birth certificate, driver’s license or utility bill. I uploaded my birth certificate.</p>
<p>02/01/23: I’m asked to send a notarized copy of my birth certificate to their address P.O Box 856, Lviv, Ukraine 79008. This is the third time I'm being asked to send documents by postal service to Ukraine. Which is very expensive.</p>
<p>05/01/22: I’m asked to send a copy of a mental capacity certificate. I go to a specialist center on this, get the tests and submit the certificate to them.</p>
<p>08/12/22: I’m asked to send a notarized copy of the mental capacity certificate to their address in Ukraine. Fourth time i’m asked to send documents by land mail. I however send the documents. Got a notification from the postal service that the document has arrived. I’ve notified 1xbet and not heard from them.</p>
<p>I don’t know when this endless verification process will end and I think they are trying to defraud me of my funds. I Would like them to unblock my account and give me access to my funds.</p>
