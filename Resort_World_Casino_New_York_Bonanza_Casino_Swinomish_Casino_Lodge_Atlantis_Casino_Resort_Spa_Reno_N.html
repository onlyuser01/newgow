    <h1>Resort World Casino New York Bonanza Casino Swinomish Casino Lodge Atlantis Casino Resort Spa Reno N</h1>

<p>I registered at the casino bet it all, made a deposit with Litecoin, won, put 1054 euros on withdrawal.</p>
<p>I asked what documents are needed for verification besides the passport. They answered that they still need a registration. Well, OK. I sent a passport and residence permit</p>
<p>Next comes a letter:</p>
<p>Good afternoon Valery,</p>
<p>Thank you for the documents provided.</p>
<p>Your identity has been successfully verified.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your place of residence. In the documents sent by you, and in your profile, the addresses are different.</p>
<p>Due to the inability to verify your account, your account is blocked, your winnings are confiscated. Your last deposit will be returned to your specified payment system address.</p>
<p>I'm shocked, I think what kind of nonsense, nothing should be different, everything should be right. Asked them they answered-</p>
<p>Good afternoon Valery,</p>
<p>You did not indicate the full address in your profile, that is, you did not indicate the street, house number and apartment, therefore it is not possible to verify your address.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>3.4 If you provide incorrect personal data, we will not be able to fully verify your account. If you notice that during the registration process you provided incorrect personal data, please contact us immediately without replenishing your account.</p>
<p>3.4.2. If our security department is unable to fully verify a client's account and has reasonable suspicions that a fraudulent activity is involved in the game, the client's winnings may be canceled and the account blocked.</p>
<p>That is, imagine, for the fact that the street and house number are not indicated (there is no apartment number according to registration), they simply confiscate money !!!!!!!! It is difficult to come up with a more impudent way to steal the winnings. That is, I am ready to provide them with any documents, talk by phone, video communication, but they do not want to listen. In addition, I'm not sure that I even forgot to add the street and house numbers, it is quite possible that they came up with it all themselves.</p>
<p>Sheer chaos, not a casino, but scammers, moreover, arrogant</p>
