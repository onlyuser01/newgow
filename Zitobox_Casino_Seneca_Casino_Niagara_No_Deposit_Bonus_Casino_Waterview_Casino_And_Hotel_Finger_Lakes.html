<p>Global betting technology business with exclusive licenses in Connecticut Sportech has strengthened its board with a new independent non-executive director. Effective September 2022, Paul Justin Humphreys will be joining the company’s other three board members. Who will Humphreys be joining and what recommends him for the position? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>30+ Years of Main Board Experience</p>
<p>For starters, it is important to know that Humphreys will join three other prestigious names in the industry as part of Sportech’s board: chief financial officer Nicola Rowland, executive chairman Richard McGuire, and non-executive director Clive Whiley. The board lost two of its previous members, chief executive officer Andrew Lindley and non-executive director Ben Warn in May, now counting a total of only four members. In April, non-executive chairman Giles Vardey decided to part ways with Sportech as well. While the company has won a new board member through Humphreys, it will also soon bid farewell to Rowlands on September 30.</p>
<p>Humphreys has an impressive resume with several decades of relevant experience in the industry and its freshly appointed position within Sportech. This includes 30 years of experience in main board positions within organizations part of a wide plethora of industries. Some of his most prestigious roles were in the senior finance sector. For example, he was the group finance director for Care UK for 12 years until 2014, prior to becoming JLA Group’s chief financial officer for five years. At the moment, he is also the non-executive director for Lapp Associates.</p>
<p>Sportech, Delighted With the New Appointment</p>
<p>Through the voice of executive chairman Richard McGuire, the company expressed its delight regarding the new appointment. McGuire mentioned Humphreys’ “successful track record focused on shareholder value creation” that Sportech will harness to continue to strengthen the board’s “financial expertise and independence.”</p>
<p>Sportech provides state-of-the-art lottery technology solutions and holds exclusive licenses that allow it to conduct pari-mutuel betting via its Winners-branded venues as well as via mobile and web betting channels in the Constitution State. The company also has a license from the Connecticut Lottery Corporation to provide sports betting solutions at its venues using the Playsugarhouse brand.</p>
<p>Sportech also offers award-winning games of lottery along with dedicated iLottery software and has signed partnerships with reputable regulated gaming companies worldwide. Sportech is also the owner of 123Bet.com, which is a pan-USA pari-mutuel retail website for online users. The company aims to hold on to its global perspective and commitment to highly sustainable and responsible business practices.</p>
