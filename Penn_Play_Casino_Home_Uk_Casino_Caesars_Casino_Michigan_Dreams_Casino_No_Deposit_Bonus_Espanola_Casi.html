    <h1>Penn Play Casino Home Uk Casino Caesars Casino Michigan Dreams Casino No Deposit Bonus Espanola Casi</h1>

<p>I bought in with 25 through neosurf and had 50 free spins as well. When I was done my total free spins were only $2.50 I played "yak yeti and roll" the betting options for the game are as follows and I’ll provide a pic of this as well. .20, $1.20, $4.00, $10.00, and $16.00 I played with $1.20 all the way through I won quite a bit then I played "once upon a time" until my wagering requirements were met. My withdrawal got declined because they said I bet $5.04 once on "yak yeti and roll" this is physically impossible for me to do. In their records it shows spins you made as "buy-in" and then winnings as "winnings" I’m assuming the $5.04 should’ve said "winnings" not "buy-in" this is their error and not mine has nothing to do with me I played with in their terms and conditions even after wagering was met just in case so I don’t breach any of their terms. Provided pics will be the allowed betting for the game "yak yeti and roll" as well as the transaction number and pic of the spin that says "buy-in" $5.04 but like I said it’s impossible to bet that amount. The casino emailed me that withdrawal declined I spoke to the support staff which checked into this and said email the accounting department I’ll provide a pic of that as well. I’ve sent multiple emails and have heard nothing from them within the two days. Mind you I requested the withdrawal on sept.29 and waited five business days this Thursday they emailed saying declined. Here are the pics of the bets allowed in the game yak yeti and roll and the transaction error on their end and the support staff chat saying to wait until the accounting fixes this but have heard nothing from the actual account ring department. Also thank you very much for providing a safe and trusted space that makes it possible for people to still enjoy some online slots without having to worry about being stolen from. Thank you casino guru for making that possible. As you can see in the second picture it says "buy-in" $5.04 which is actually impossible in this game and I remember I kept it at $1.20 the whole way through but my word isn’t enough so I provided the allowed bets as well. There’s no $5.04 available to even bet? Also the email saying I bet over $5 and declined my withdrawal is also attached. Thank you very much casino guru you guys are continuously providing one of the most important and useful services in the online gambling industry in my humble opinion.</p>
