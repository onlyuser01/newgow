    <h1>Monticello Casino Online Casino Real Money Casino San Clemente Casino Tables Riverside Casino Rivers</h1>

<p>Good day Casino guru, i have this concern about GG.BET where they asked me to undergo KYC verification,which i did. It all started out when i tried to withdraw 350 USD, they sent me a notification that says i need to submit pictures of my ID, and a selfie with the ID and GG.BET ID number written in a sheet of paper close to my face, i did what they asked me to do, i follow the exact instructions, as much as possible i made the documents and pictures visible and legible but they keep on sending me notification that i need to Redo and send again documents, i don't know where the problem is and i tried to contact the support/customer service but they're unresponsive. I know that this is not a direct casino related problem because although i played casino in GG.Bet, i also spend or play my money on Match betting both Sports and eSports.</p>
<p>Almost all GG.BET user experience this kind of problem when doing some withdrawal, that KYC verification is very absurd and kind of waste of time, it's essential but not helpful. I hope you can help me out with this, Thank you</p>
