<p>Besides changing the name of the National Gambling Treatment Service to National Gambling Support Network, the charity confirmed it doubled the funding for the next year</p>
<p>The leading independent charity in the UK, GambleAware, announced changes to its National Gambling Treatment Service (NGTS) Monday. The charity confirmed that the NGTS was renamed to National Gambling Support Network (NGSN). Additionally, GambleAware confirmed that it doubled the funding for the next year for the newly renamed network that will help by providing vital support and treatment for people affected by gambling harm in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the NGSN is expected to “deliver a regional-first approach, improving referral routes and ensuring individuals receive the right support at the right time,” explained the charity. The network consists of third-sector treatment providers that deliver confidential support, without judgment for people affected by problem gambling.</p>
<p>The services and support is free and can also be accessed by people affected by someone else’s gambling. One of the goals of the NGSN is to reduce the negative impact of gambling harm and provide support for people who need it. This, in turn, is expected to reduce the problem gambling rate and prevent the escalation of such cases. The services provided via the network also help reduce the pressure on the NHS, explained GambleAware.</p>
<p>“The National Gambling Support Network (NGSN) will deliver a regional-first approach, improving referral routes and ensuring individuals receive the right support at the right time,“ explains a statement released by GambleAware</p>
<p>The Network Provides Vital Support and Treatment</p>
<p>Early intervention when it comes to problem gambling is vitally important. Such treatment and support services are expected to have different long-term positive effects for the people affected. Additionally, the NGSN will leverage a regional-first approach, which according to GambleAware will result in “improved referral routes for anyone experiencing harms from gambling.”</p>
<p>“As the country’s leading commissioner in this sector, we’re delighted to announce the new National Gambling Support Network and our increase in investment for those experiencing gambling harm.“ Anna Hargrave, chief commissioning officer at GambleAware</p>
<p>Anna Hargrave, GambleAware’s chief commissioning officer, explained that the charity remains committed to investing in the NGSN which will help by providing treatment and support for people affected by problem gambling. She explained that the network helps connect regional providers that make a difference for people that need support. Finally, Hargrave spoke about the importance of involving people with lived experience of gambling harm and confirmed that the network will continue to deliver vital support.</p>
