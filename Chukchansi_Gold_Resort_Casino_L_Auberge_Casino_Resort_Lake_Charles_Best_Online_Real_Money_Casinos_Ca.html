    <h1>Chukchansi Gold Resort Casino L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Best Online Real Money Casinos Ca</h1>

<p>We received a response from Extra Vegas Casino.</p>
<p>What they found out:</p>
<p>When you made a deposit of €25 you still had €0.06 bonus money left on your account. Because bonus money is used first by their system all your next bets had a bonus money component from which you can withdraw maximum €100 (free bonus)</p>
<p>Our opinion: If you have a small amount of bonus money left on your account and made a new deposit, the casino should automatically void that bonus and in case of higher amount ask the player what he wants to do with a bonus.</p>
<p>The truth is that you were able to see that bonus is still active and you could cancel the bonus anytime/ask support to do that but despite that doesn't make a sense not to make it simpler.</p>
<p>We have one more similar case which is now evaluating by MGA, I would suggest waiting on their ruling.</p>
<p>Extra Vegas Casino is licensed in Curacao, but I believe that common sense will win in this case.</p>
<p>Extra Vegas Casino representatives:</p>
<p>The gambling should be easy and fair, and €0.06 is a value which cannot be used for a single spin. I don't see a reason why this bonus was not cancelled automatically. Pushing a player into situations like this only lead to the bad player experience.</p>
<p>Our suggestion for the casino is to pay out the winnings.</p>
