<p>Manchester City Football Club has signed a regional partnership agreement with Sportium Apuestas Deportivas SA, a 50% joint venture between Cirsa and Ladbrokes. Deportivas, which is busy developing retail and online sports betting business in Spain, will turn into the official betting partner of Manchester City in the LatAm region.</p>
<p>The Collaboration, “A New Step Forward” for Sportium’s Plans to Go Global</p>
<p>According to Sportium Deportivas’ chief executive officer Alberto Ejkarrat, the new partnership is expected to help the company strengthen its foothold in the global market that the brand has been trying to expand into. At the same time, the deal will represent the brand’s first Premier League club partnership.</p>
<p>Ejkarrat further explained that Sportium has always been connected to the “best competitions and the main sports clubs,” which would make the fresh Man City deal a natural choice. The two share the same core values, with special emphasis on including integrity, effort, and teamwork. The same values are expected to be introduced to those Latin regions where Sportium has already established a good reputation with the help of its one-of-a-kind omnichannel entertainment options.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi-backed club welcomed Sportium to its family of official betting partners. The prestigious list includes popular names with a good reputation in their fields, ranging from LeoVegas for Canada and Europe and Highlight Games. The latter was given access to the club’s archived footage from league cup and domestic matches. The historic footage will be used to manufacture fresh games. Special attention will be given to scratchcard games and instant win games that will be available for online and retail players.</p>
<p>Manchester City, “Pleased” to Welcome Sportium As Regional Partner</p>
<p>City Football group’s vice president of global sales Dina Ahmad explained the club was “pleased to welcome Sportium” as its brand new regional partner in Latin America. Ahmad also called the fresh agreement one that is expected to enable the club to build on its growth and get in touch with new audiences in the area. At the same time, the club is expected to attract its fans even more with the help of “unique content and experiences.”</p>
<p>Sportium took control of Marca Apuestas, Unidad Editorial’s gambling division in April 2021. The Latin American market also received the news of a fresh partnership between Betcris and Vibra Gaming in February. The two parties signed a distribution agreement deal with the purpose of strengthening their positions in the markets in the area.</p>
