<p>The partnership will see US Integrity become the official integrity service provider for UFC, with the aim of identifying and analyzing unusual wagering activity that may indicate potential integrity concerns. The collaboration has an immediate effect.</p>
<p>UFC Made Serious Advances Towards Better Integrity Controls</p>
<p>The partnership with US Integrity will help UFC strengthen its existing best practices by applying the company’s expertise in data intelligence to proactively identify irregular bout-level wagering patterns. This information can be used to inform UFC and can be shared with sports books in advance, allowing them to make informed decisions on whether to halt betting on a particular event.</p>
<p>Riché T. McKnight, Executive Vice President &amp; General Counsel of UFC, said that the company has had productive discussions with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) to address concerns expressed by operators. The UFC has made enhancements to its Athlete Conduct Policy to more clearly prohibit any UFC athlete from placing any wagers directly or through a third party on any UFC match, including placing wagers on themselves. The company has also expanded its policy to the so-called ‘UFC Insiders’ to make it clear that the same prohibitions against wagering apply to an athlete’s coaches, managers, handlers, athletic trainers, and other individuals affiliated with the athletes or UFC.</p>
<p>Matthew Holt, US Integrity’s CEO &amp; co-founder, said that the company is proud to partner with UFC and assist as wagering on their events continues to rapidly grow across the regulated sports betting market. He added that US Integrity’s mission is to provide best-in-class insights and compliance solutions to its clients and that they are looking forward to working with the exceptional team at UFC to improve its integrity policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Partnership with US Integrity Triggered by Betting Scandal</p>
<p>Recent allegations of suspicious betting involving MMA coach James Krause have caused a stir in the fighting community. Krause, a 36-year-old veteran of the sport, was accused of profiting from an unexpected first-round technical knockout in a match between Darrick Minner and Shayilan Nuerdanbieke.</p>
<p>The scandal prompted an investigation from US Integrity and other authorities and the UFC has threatened to revoke the licenses of any fighters associated with Krause.</p>
<p>Following the fight, gambling authorities in New Jersey suspended wagering on any events related to James Krause, while two Canadian jurisdictions temporarily halted betting on the UFC. Alberta lifted its ban last month, and now, AGCO has also lifted its ban on UFC betting that was imposed on December 1 after the Nuerdanbieke vs. Minner fight.</p>
<p>AGCO has pointed out that it lifts the ban as UFC has made changes to its athlete code of conduct also adding “UFC Insiders” in its prohibitions and because it hired US Integrity to provide enhanced monitoring and action against insider betting through the strengthening of their internal processes.</p>
