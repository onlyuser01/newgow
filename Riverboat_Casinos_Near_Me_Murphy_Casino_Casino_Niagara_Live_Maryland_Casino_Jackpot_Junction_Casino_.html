    <h1>Riverboat Casinos Near Me Murphy Casino Casino Niagara Live Maryland Casino Jackpot Junction Casino</h1>

<p>I made a deposit with MuchBetter because of the bonus here at Casino.Guru (100% up to 500 euros). After making the deposit, I wanted to play various slots. This includes the game providers Pragmatic, Play'n Go, Thunderkick and Gamomat. All games, no matter which, were blocked with an active bonus. There was absolutely nothing about that in the terms and conditions. I am a meticulous observer of the bonus rules so that I do not commit any violations. And in the terms and conditions of this casino there is nothing that these slots / slot providers are blocked.</p>
<p>I didn't do a single spin as a result. I revoked the bonus so that my real money matched my deposit, i.e. 500 euros. I wrote to the customer chat and asked for a quick, unbureaucratic chargeback of my deposit to my MuchBetter account. The chat said that this would probably go very quickly and easily, since I didn't play with the money.</p>
<p>Contrary to this statement, they wanted to verify my account after waiting 2 days. I have sent all the necessary documents. Suddenly they wanted a selfie of me and my identity card. I also did that and sent it.</p>
<p>After a day, customer service contacted me and informed me that the finance department had declined a refund. I should therefore consider making a normal withdrawal. I did this afterwards. That was on November 12th, 2020.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions state that a payout via e-wallt takes up to 48 hours. When I asked why this already takes 5 days, customer service told me that a payout would take between 10-14 working days.</p>
<p>In the meantime I don't see the "Casino" section on the casino so that you can play slots. It is possible that it has withdrawn from the casino market entirely. But it can also be a display error. Or, the casino has banned me from this section.</p>
<p>I am hereby filing a complaint against the casino. This is for the reasons mentioned above. I hereby expressly warn everyone against depositing money at this casino.</p>
