    <h1>Harrahs Casino Atlantic City Seven Clans Casino Thief River Falls Online Casino Indiana Illinois Cas</h1>

<p>Dear koheipon11,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. Could you please advise if your account has been fully verified? Have you been advised why you can’t withdraw your winnings? Is it an internal casino system issue, or it’s related to your account only?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"4.9. A player who has never made a deposit and wishes to withdraw a free chip win, is required to first make one successful minimum deposit of 25.00 ($,,£,AUD, or 250 ZAR). This first deposit amount is not allowed to be withdrawn or added to an existing pending withdrawal. If added to an existing withdrawal, the amount will be deducted from the total withdrawal amount. A players who has previously made a successful deposit and is now wishing to withdraw a free chip win, is required to have deposited within the last 30 days in order for the withdrawal to be approved and the deposit cannot be added to an existing pending withdrawal. If added to an existing withdrawal, the amount will be deducted from the total withdrawal amount. Free Bonuses (Free Chips) have a wagering requirement of 20X to 60X unless otherwise specified."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have deposited any funds into your account for the verification purposes? Please specify which exact bonus you have redeemed and played. Have you profited from any other promotional offers in this casino in the past?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue and receive your winnings as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
