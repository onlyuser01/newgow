<p>Dazzletag has secured a high-profile content partnership with Red Tiger for the launch of the developer’s portfolio of HTML5 titles, featuring megaways and jackpot games.</p>
<p>Dazzletag Rolls Red Tiger Content Across Five Brands</p>
<p>Red Tiger continues to build up its portfolio of partners by entering a new content agreement with Dazzletag, an operator of several established iGaming brands.</p>
<p>The new content boost will allow Dazzletag to roll out Red Tiger’s products across its FruitKings, Casushi, Myjackpotcasino Playsunny, and PeachyGames brands empowering an already rich portfolio of top-shelf gaming choices.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Dazzletag casino manager Jordan Rosamond said he was pleased to see Red Tiger roll out its content across Dazzle’s fleet of websites.</p>
<p>Rosamond confirmed that the company has spent considerable effort and time to create a portfolio of products that meets player expectations. Therefore, strengthening the library of games was a key priority for the company.</p>
<p>Red Tiger adds a mix of engaging jackpots, player-favorite slots, and a number of player management capabilities and promotional software, making it perfect for Dazzletag’s brands, Rosamond continued.</p>
<p>So far in 2020, Red Tiger’s games have paid €34 million at press time. Chris Looney, commercial director at Red Tiger, has confirmed the company’s commitment to bringing an advanced product to the table.</p>
<p>He noted that Red Tiger was an accomplished developer among both the casino and bingo audiences. Red Tiger has had a strong year so far. The company tied up an important partnership with Kindred Group’s 32Red brand back in August.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, Red Tiger was able to debut its products on one of the leading British iGaming websites. In both deals, Red Tiger provided partners with a growing catalog of HTML5 games, including award-winning and exciting titles, such as Piggy Riches Megaways, Dynamite Riches, and Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, which is one of the latest additions to the company’s library.</p>
<p>Red Tiger was acquired by NetEnt in September 2020 for £220 million. The brand has secured several high-profile partnerships so far this year, going live with Premier Gaming brands and launching its products on the Patrouche’s Casino du Lac Meyrin. In June, Red Tiger rolled out its iGaming content on 888 in Spain.</p>
