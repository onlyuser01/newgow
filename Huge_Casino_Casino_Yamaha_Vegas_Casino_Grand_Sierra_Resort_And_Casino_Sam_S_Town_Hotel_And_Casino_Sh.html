<p>The leading iGaming company delivering solutions and software for the growing online gambling industry, SOFTSWISS, announced that its department responsible for creating frontend designs for online casinos, WebStudio, utilizes and benefits from using Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>The company acknowledged that AI helps take iGaming project designs to a new level by delivering efficiencies and innovations. The innovative technology plays a strategic role in iGaming project designs by adding unique elements and providing flexible options for the designers. Moreover, SOFTSWISS confirmed it combines AI with the use of innovative tools that bring engaging and unique visuals to its partners' online casinos.</p>
<p>While many fear AI will replace them, this is not the case for the talented creators at WebStudio. In a statement released by SOFTSWISS, WebStudio's Head, Olga Ivanchik, acknowledged that AI can serve as an extra advantage when creating a unique product. She explained: "Designers suggest the initial idea and generate queries for the program. This requires creativity, inspiration, and imagination."</p>
<p>Ivanchik said that a person or a machine that doesn't have sufficient knowledge or experience cannot create a project that is unique and also practical to use. "This requires human imagination and the unique experience that comes with practice," she said. Finally, Ivanchik pointed out: "And the synergy of a talented designer and a multifunctional tool gives maximum results in minimal time."</p>
<p>There are many advantages to using AI, SOFTSWISS explains. According to the company, designers that leverage AI can quickly create visuals that are high-quality. The leading technology enables them to incorporate unique visuals that underline the brand and style of the casino. At the same time, the designers can focus on developing a user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>Ultimately, leveraging AI and innovative tools enables the designers to create a product that is easy to use and stands out with quality graphics. This, in turn, helps boost player engagement and acquisition. "Before implementing AI in design work, creating the first design layouts took several weeks, and the client options were less abundant," explained SOFTSWISS. Thanks to the use of AI, the company's clients can now access different design options quickly while the designers can implement changes to the projects faster.</p>
<p>Recently, SOFTSWISS and CoinsPaid joined forces by donating $50,000 to people that were affected by the devastating earthquakes in Turkey. In light of the devastating natural disasters, the donation sought to deliver aid, enable affected people to access basic necessities and help survivors rebuild their lives.</p>
