<p>Nazionale Elettronica srl or NE Games, an Italian slot provider, has signed a partnership with Flows, a company that is centred on the idea of “no-coding” and that seeks to drive innovation in the iGaming sector and gambling industry. This tie-up is a second partnership for the company in the Italian market, as it seeks to expand its regional reach and pull with prominent local players.</p>
<p>Flows Makes Another Move in Italian Gaming Market</p>
<p>Nazionale Elettronica will benefit from this new collaboration by “supercharging” its CRM. This will happen through the slot provider now being able to develop new features and options without ever having to use code to bring these new innovative solutions to bear.

<p>Flows’ solutions allow businesses to reduce operational and development costs and time. The company is expanding its reach across the entire iGaming industry, and it presently works with a number of companies, including operators, affiliate networks, and not least – suppliers. Commenting on this partnership, Nazionale Elettronica CEO Danilo Festa said:</p>
<p>We immediately recognized how Flows can supercharge our CRM capabilities via their innovation platform by enabling us to build additional promotional tools, which will instantly improving our offering for our partners and their players with hyper personalized promotional campaigns – all without the need to write a single line of code. Nazionale Elettronica CEO Danilo Festa</p>

<p>Flows Director of Sales Domenico Mazzola was equally stoked with the new opportunity. He said that joining forces with Nazionale Elettronica was an important enhancement to the company’s own portfolio. He welcomed Nazionale Elettronica’s decision to turn to Flow to ignite its business growth.</p>
