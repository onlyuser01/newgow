<p>The Sportsbet.io Bitcoin Hunt celebrating the partnership with Southampton FC has come to an end with a lucky winner announced. The contest took three rounds to complete and participants were urged to discover QR codes hidden – often in plain sight – across the city of Southampton.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io and Southampton Wrap up Bitcoin Hunt</p>
<p>Fans had to sort out various puzzles in the form of blockchain games and participate in various social media activations for even more bitcoin. The winner was announced during the home game against Crystal Palace with one Clare Way winning the Bitcoin Hunt and scooping up a bitcoin token worth $33,000 at current market crash levels. The way was happy with the outcome and said it was the first competition he had the chance to enter.</p>
<p>Southampton FC head of partnership marketing Charles Read said that it has been a blast working with various partners to see the competition come to fruition. Southampton collaborated with Formidable, a creative agency, and Unit 9, a tech partner, to ensure that Southampton FC fans feel involved and that the contests are accessible.</p>
<p>Sportsbet.io head of sportsbook Joe McCallum was similarly happy with the successful completion of the project. McCallum added that Sportsbet.io was on a mission to bust the myths about cryptocurrencies and help audiences to connect with the segment in the most accessible way possible.</p>

<p>“We feel the competition has helped everyone understand the world of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology in a safe environment,” he added. Sportsbet.io has been actively looking to expand its presence with the world’s top-flight soccer and athletic contests. Sportsbet.io has been closing in on deals with individual teams such as Arsenal FC and São Paulo FC.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has sponsored a number of other soccer clubs from across the world, serving as an ambassador for positive change in attitude toward cryptocurrencies.</p>
