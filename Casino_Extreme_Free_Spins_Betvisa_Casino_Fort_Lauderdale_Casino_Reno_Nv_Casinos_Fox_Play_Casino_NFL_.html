<p>Jameson Williams, Detroit Lions' receiver, spoke about his suspension saying that he is a football player and not a gambler</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently a hot topic across the United States. Five years after the repeal of PASPA, betting is available online and retail and more than 30 states offer legal options for the activity. But the statewide spread resulted in fears of integrity for professional sports leagues such as the NFL. Last month, the League suspended five players and started an investigation into gambling violations.</p>
<p>Now, one of the players that was suspended recently, Jameson Williams of the Detroit Lions, spoke about his six-game suspension. As announced by ESPN, Williams said that he wasn’t aware of the NFL’s gambling policy. “Just make the right decisions, it was something I wasn’t aware of and it caught me,” he said. Additionally, the suspended player explained that he isn’t a gambler but a football player.</p>
<p>“I’m not a gambler. I’m a football player.“ Jameson Williams</p>
<p>Williams also explained that the suspension for him and some of his fellow teammates came “out of the blue.” Clearly, Williams was unhappy with the situation. He admitted he “felt it alone” but acknowledged that he is looking forward to returning and playing with the team.</p>
<p>The Young NFL Player Has a Lot of Potential</p>
<p>Dan Campbell, the team’s head coach, spoke about the work with Williams. The coach said that he sees the young player get better. “We’re already miles ahead with him,” pointed out Campbell. Additionally, he explained that Williams has a lot of potential to continue to develop and grow further.</p>
<p>Overall, there were four Detroit Lions suspended last month and the list included Williams, Quintez Cephus, and Stanley Berryhill, all of which are receivers, and safety C.J. Moore. The NFL also suspended Shaka Toney, Washington Commanders’ defensive end.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the American Gaming Association (AGA) revealed that in 2019, only 63% of American adults supported the US Supreme Court’s decision to strike down PASPA, which paved the way for the expansion of betting. However, judging by the latest data, the AGA said, 85% of American adults favored the US Supreme Court’s decision, while 77% of the adults supported the legalization of betting within the state they live.</p>
