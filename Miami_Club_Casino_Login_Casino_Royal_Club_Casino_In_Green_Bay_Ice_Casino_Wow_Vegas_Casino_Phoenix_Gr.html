<p>Phoenix Graveyard review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Phoenix Graveyard has a gothic horror theme.</p>
<p>Players will wander into a mysterious village, seeking shelter from the misty darkness. There, they’ll meet a host of characters as well as mythical phoenixes, and the grim reaper himself.</p>
<p>Players with an interest in the supernatural will particularly appreciate this slot’s theme.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack establishes a dramatic atmosphere with its moody beat and just a hint of rock influence. Players will feel as if they have reached the climax of an action-packed film.</p>
<p>The most striking symbols are the dark phoenix and the fiery phoenix. These magical creatures are drawn in a vivid fantasy style that contrasts the death and rebirth that defines phoenixes.</p>
<p>Several human characters appear among the symbols as well, including elegantly dressed aristocrats and a mournful minstrel.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, skull-shaped lanterns glow softly. In the background, a gothic village can be seen, shrouded with mist.</p>
<p>Together, the animation and soundtrack create an engaging gothic fantasy.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Phoenix Graveyard is a five-reel, three-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Phoenix Wild symbol has the ability to jump to new positions during respins and free spins. Meanwhile, the Phoenix Multiplier Wild doubles its multiplier.</p>
<p>The Grim Reaper Walking Wild triggers the respins feature and slices high value symbols. It also has the ability to battle the Phoenix Wilds.</p>
<p>When the Phoenix and Grim Reaper battle, the outcome may be that the Phoenix doubles its multiplier, or that the Grim Reaper doubles its multiplier. Alternatively, the Phoenix may jump away, leaving a Feather Wild behind. The Feather Wild then transforms into a Phoenix Wild.</p>
<p>The Sudden Death feature means that symbols can be randomly sliced, increasing the potential for wins.</p>
<p>When players land 3-5 Bonus symbols, the Free Spins feature begins with 1-3 Phoenix Wilds awarded. The Phoenix Wilds come with a multiplier equal to the position’s win ways. Throughout the Free Spins feature, expanded win ways and Phoenix Wilds remain.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature can be retriggered.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Phoenix Graveyard is 95.0%, well below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Phoenix Graveyard is high, which would have made this slot a good fit for our preferred strategies if it offered a more favorable RTP. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, alongside higher RTPs.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility gothic fantasy slot.</p>
<p>Though the theme and animation are entertaining, Phoenix Graveyard’s RTP is simply too low to merit a recommendation.</p>
<p>Some players may stop by to explore the bonus features and enjoy the aesthetic, but they should move on to pursue slots that offer a higher RTP.</p>
