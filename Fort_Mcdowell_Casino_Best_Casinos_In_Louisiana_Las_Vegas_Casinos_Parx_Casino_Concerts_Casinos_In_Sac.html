<p>The market-leading sports betting and gaming company, BetMGM, announced an important partnership extension with the National Hockey League (NHL). The company confirmed Tuesday it entered into a multi-year extension with the League. As a result, BetMGM will continue to serve as the NHL's Official Sports Betting and Gaming Partner.</p>
<p>The collaboration will enable the leading iGaming and sports betting operator to leverage NHL imagery to create League and team-branded casino games. Moreover, BetMGM will be able to create unique VIP fan experiences, catering to NHL fans across the United States.</p>
<p>Per the new multi-year North American partnership extension, the company will also benefit from significant branding within nationally televised broadcasts across the US. Besides during the regular NHL season, BetMGM visible signage will be available during the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Additionally, the leading betting and iGaming operator will benefit from Digitally Enhanced Dasherboards.</p>
<p>Jason Jazayeri, NHL's Vice President, Business Development, revealed in a statement that the League is excited to sign the new partnership extension with BetMGM. "The evolution of our partnership with BetMGM will focus on building unique and compelling fan experiences, as well as event activation and media programming all with an eye towards delivering exciting new ways for our fans to interact and engage with the sport they love," he added.</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM's CEO, was similarly thrilled regarding the extended North American partnership with the NHL. "Our partnership extension with the NHL enables us to enhance the BetMGM product and offer fans unforgettable entertainment built around the game they love," he added. Finally, Greenblatt said: "The NHL is more thrilling than ever â€“ a symphony of athleticism, teamwork, and skill on skates. We look forward to bringing our customers exceptional live experiences and new content."</p>
<p>While BetMGM continues to expand across the US and engage with new sports fans and bettors, the company remains committed to responsible gambling. Currently, the leading betting operator offers a wide range of responsible gambling tools and resources, including its industry-leading program, GameSense. This unique program is an addition to BetMGM's responsible gambling tools and seeks to ensure customers have a safe and entertaining experience.</p>
<p>Besides responsible gambling resources, the operator also supports the American Gaming Association's Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly campaign. This initiative, which is also backed by the NHL, advocates for responsible gambling among sports bettors.</p>
