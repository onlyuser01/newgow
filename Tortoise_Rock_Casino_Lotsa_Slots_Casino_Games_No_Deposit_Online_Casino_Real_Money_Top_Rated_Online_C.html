    <h1>Tortoise Rock Casino Lotsa Slots Casino Games No Deposit Online Casino Real Money Top Rated Online C</h1>

<p>I paid 600 euros on Saturday evening, not having received any bonus, I ask in chat why, also because it was written on their site 100% first deposit bonus</p>
<p>They told me I had to write to suppor@betmartini.com</p>
<p>So I did, no response but on Sunday when I entered the betmartini site I saw that there was a bonus of â‚¬50 which to make it become real money I had to play for up to 1200 euros, I played in slots and I won while always keeping the bonus under control until I managed to reach the goal, having reached a win of around 1700 I exit the game and see that it has become real money, I continue playing until I reach a win of 4500 I make withdrawals with my infinity which I didn't know what it was, I ask in chat if the withdrawal was successful and they tell me that I had to wait for an email from kyc that arrived the next day asking me for all the documents, I sent everything and I explained to them via email that I didn't have mu infinity if there was the possibility of withdrawing via Iban, no response from them, on the site I see that there was also the possibility of doing so via IBAN, I cancel the previous withdrawals and make a withdrawal of 2000 and one of 2500</p>
<p>After two days they ask me to confirm my IBAN by sending other documents, after half a day they write to me your account and it has been verified you can only withdraw 500 euros and the 4000 will be cancelled, from there I asked for various info but with no response, only in chat someone who He calls himself responsible and said that I could only withdraw 50 euros for the bonus and they would do 500 as a favor.</p>
<p>My account was blocked, I sent other emails but no response, I sent you via email to the address you gave me all the various screens in my possession.</p>
