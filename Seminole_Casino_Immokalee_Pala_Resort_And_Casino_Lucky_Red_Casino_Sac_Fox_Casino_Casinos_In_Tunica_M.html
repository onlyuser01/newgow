<p>Future Anthem, a company that specializes in building solutions tailored to the needs of the gambling industry, and specifically focus on AI-driven solutions that boost consumer safety and loyalty, has appointed John Atkinson as its new VP of Business Development – Americas.</p>
<p>This appointment comes at a crucial time for the company, as Future Anthem is looking to expand its reach in the fast-growing iGaming market and secure a pole position in the United States, which is embracing online casino gaming at a steady if still somewhat hesitant pace.</p>
<p>Future Anthem will benefit from Atkinson’s expertise who himself has worked in numerous roles across companies such as FanDuel, 888 and GeniusSports, and is well aware of how to operate in challenging markets and North America specifically, owing to his past experience.</p>
<p>He also brings media experience having worked with ESPN and Fox Sports. Commenting on his appointment, Atkinson said that he was very happy to join Future Anthem, a company he described as a leader in AI technology. He further clarified that he will be working to ensure that the company continues to meet its goals and grow in the region by bringing first-class products to its partners.</p>
<p>"It’s a fantastic time to join the team and I’m ready to help drive the business towards its goals," Atkinson said. Future Anthem CEO Leigh Nissim was similarly pleased with this opportunity and welcomed the chance to see his company appointment and industry veteran whose experience will play a crucial role in furthering Future Anthem’s prospects among US operators.</p>
<p>"We look forward to further embedding real-time AI across the US and creating long-term working relationships throughout the region," Nissim said. There is a huge demand for real-time personalization, as it allows companies to fine-tune their product offer in a way that makes it possible to strengthen business revenue, protect consumers, and drive solid bottom lines.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Future Anthem’s product has been sought after by several companies in the industry, including Betsson Group which cited the former firm’s ability to deliver personalized experience as the main reason why. Future Anthem previously turned to another responsible gambling specialist, Svend Aage Kirk, who also focuses on big data, and brought him in as an Expert Advisor.</p>
