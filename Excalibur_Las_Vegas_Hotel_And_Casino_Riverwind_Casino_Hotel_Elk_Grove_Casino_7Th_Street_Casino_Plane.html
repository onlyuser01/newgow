<p>Gaming Corps, the leading Swedish games developer, forged a new deal that enabled it to significantly expand the reach of its engaging content by teaming up with St8, the leading casino games aggregation platform. Announced earlier this week, the new collaboration sees the Swedish games developer deliver its full portfolio of games for St8.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, the aggregation platform will now offer Gaming Corps' complete suite of Mine, Table, Crash, as well as Slot games. The deal also encompasses the iGaming developer's famous Plinko titles. As a result, St8's aggregation platform will expand the reach of popular games like Penalty Champion, Coin Miner 2, Raging Zeus, as well as Jet Lucky 2, among others.</p>
<p>Alex Zvezdochkin, St8's Head of Operations, shared his excitement about the new collaboration in a statement. "We are delighted to announce the integration of Gaming Corps as our newest games supplier. This partnership marks an important milestone for us as we continue to enhance our casino aggregator platform," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Zvezdochkin acknowledged that Gaming Corps offers an engaging portfolio from famous iGaming studios. This, according to him, makes the company a perfect partner for St8. Finally, Zvezdochkin said: "Their games are known for their innovation, captivating gameplay and immersive graphics, all of which align perfectly with our mission to provide the ultimate entertainment for our customers."</p>
<p>Currently, St8 serves the iGaming sector by allowing operators to integrate games from leading providers. This, according to the company, can be completed via a seamless API in just a few days. Ultimately, St8's aggregation platform enables iGaming and betting operators to gain access to a wide range of games and benefit from fast deployment. The company currently has a strong presence within the online gambling sector in Asia but it continues to expand.</p>
<p>Danielle Calafato, Gaming Corps' CCO, was similarly delighted about the new agreement with St8. "St8 has decades of experience in B2B igaming operations, and they will be the perfect partner for us as we continue to produce first-class casino games content," she said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Calafato noted: "We are deeply committed to providing our players with various avenues to access our game portfolio, and we firmly believe that our partnership with St8 will undoubtedly achieve tremendous success."</p>
<p>Recently, Gaming Corps announced a new deal with SuprNation. Through that deal, the content provider expanded significantly the reach of its engaging and unique games.</p>
