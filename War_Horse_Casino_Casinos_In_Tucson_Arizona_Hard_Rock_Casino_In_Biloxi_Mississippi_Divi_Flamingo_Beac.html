    <h1>War Horse Casino Casinos In Tucson Arizona Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Mississippi Divi Flamingo Beac</h1>

<p>The aim of the article in your "terms of use" that you are mentionning is pretty clear. It is aimed that the person concerned have to verify if he is allowed to use your service.</p>
<p>After verification, an official german resident as I am, has to follow the german gambling laws to allow me therefore to play online. This is perfectly know to MGA licenced casino such as Frankcasino or Casimba since I played there.</p>
<p>This follows the law of european union, MGA terms as well as Maltese, Geman and french laws. The only condition concerning the french law would be that the users is not a resident of France.</p>
<p>I perfectly understand that you are cautionnous with documents coming from France since this country is a restricted country for people wanting to play from there. However, as you are a company located in european union, you can not decide which documents you are accepting or not as a proof of identity. This is ruled by the european law and especially the " DIRECTIVE 2006/123/CE " (article 20/2). Not following this article makes your terms illegal in the european juridiction. As I already mentionned, a precision of the law by the european commission was made here:</p>
<p>The question to the european parliament here (where the question is pretty clear): https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2014-004933_EN.html</p>
<p>with the clear response here:</p>
<p>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2014-004933-ASW_EN.html?redirect</p>
<p>In this case, an english company (was still in european union) refused a german ID as a proof of identity and it was considered as a discrimination.</p>
<p>Therefore, no company or administration in Europa can refuse an official ID or passport as a proof of identity without being guilty of discrimination.</p>
<p>Finally, you precise that: "In your case, in order to confirm your full residence status in Germany, we have to get a certain set of documents from you to complete the verification which should be a German identity document (passp足ort足/ID足/re足sidence permit/driver's license) + bank statement (already received from you)."</p>
<p>"Full residence status"! This is not true. I would like to remind you that an ID or a passport is not a proof of residency but only a proof of identity. I already gave you different proof of residency such as bank statement, salary slip and of course the "Meldescheinigung". Highest german documents to prove the residency.</p>
<p>Please get in touched with other support agents under MGA casino like "Casimba" ones that have german or european competences which will confirm what I am writing.</p>
<p>I am not staying in Germany under "certain circumstances" as you said. I am an official german resident since more than three years and I am working and living here.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Boris</p>
