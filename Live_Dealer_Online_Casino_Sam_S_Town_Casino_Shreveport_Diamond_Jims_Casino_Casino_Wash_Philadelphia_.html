    <h1>Live Dealer Online Casino Sam S Town Casino Shreveport Diamond Jims Casino Casino Wash Philadelphia</h1>

<p>In live chat you make false promises, i.e. you say report back in chat after deposit and loss of money because you get free spins. But without depositing a bonus code you would get more. About 90% of the time you never get free spins later, if at all 10 free spins in games where you can't win anything. Deposited 38 times never won, wins in games are over 90% lower than stake. Bonus spins in the games very rare and yet win extremely low. Example Big Bamboo 0.20 cents Use a total of 19 free spins, win 6 free spins ×5. My total profit is 0.27 cents. Games do not run smoothly if there is a chance of winning, the game jumps so that you do not win. Processes in the games 80% always the same. First a win 0.20 bet about 3.50- at most 8 € then rarely win 2-5 times more than the bet then win lower than the bet. A short time later problems in the game no matter which game loads for a very long time after that no more wins no matter where. It's always the same. Tried several games, always the same. I pointed out the problems several times without ever asking for anything, never responded.</p>
<p>You are lied to and cheated on. Requested my gameplays with bet and wins and my RTP worth and if there were any problems in the games etc. No response have been waiting for 7 days to be notified multiple times. A deposit made with Sofort banking ( online)</p>
<p>I waited 3 days until it was credited why ever. All in all warning about this casino. Have screensHots , video recordings of my game processes, chat histories, etc. I'm normally satisfied with the casinos in Curacao, but not this one. The amount in dispute I have written as deposits. I'm not asking for a refund or anything like that just want to warn others. Few examples</p>
