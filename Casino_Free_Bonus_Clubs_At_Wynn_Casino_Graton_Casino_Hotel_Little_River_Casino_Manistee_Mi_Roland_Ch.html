    <h1>Casino Free Bonus Clubs At Wynn Casino Graton Casino Hotel Little River Casino Manistee Mi Roland Ch</h1>

<p>Well, that's the problem. Yesterday I was still waiting for the casino to respond to my email. So in a nutshell. My account has an approved first withdrawal made 3 weeks ago. And on Friday I won about 1000euro. I entered a selection of 600euro. Followed by contact support. I opened a chat that required a Screenshot skrill account. (It was in my approved documents all the time) so I uploaded it again. Afterwards, the support told me that nothing stood in the way of the selection. But unfortunately things were different. Subsequent selection again suspended by the casino. Well, in short, there was a two-hour debate with the chat staff. They still required documents to verify the address. (These were also uploaded to my account a few weeks ago. When I asked if a verified account and a selection had been made in the past, I needed to verify again. I didn't get the answers throughout the conversation. I am announcing that I have been assigned a VIP Manager, so I immediately wrote an email to the VIP manager, in which I just asked him to answer the question I asked the chat staff. I received the email today, of course without any answer. I can only write that the casino's policy tries at all costs to delay the selections and prolong the process as long as possible.Of course (as a few players certainly have in mind as well) I gradually dropped to 0euro in my account. my question (the fact that I gradually lost money is just my stupidity and mistake) I never wrote in any conversation with the casino, so I would just like to say to everyone who plays here that even having everything approved does not mean that you will see your choice. Hands off from BIZZO Casino.</p>
