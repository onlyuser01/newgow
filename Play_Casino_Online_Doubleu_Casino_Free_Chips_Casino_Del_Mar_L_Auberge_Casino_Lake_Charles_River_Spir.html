<p>Lousiana Casinos to Let Go Another 1,150 Workers in August</p>
<p>Another 1,150 casino workers will lose their jobs, the Associated Press reported, citing data by the Louisiana Workforce Commission.</p>
<p>Louisiana to See 1,150 Workers Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>Louisiana casinos may have to lay off as many as 1,150 workers in several locations in August and what would be the next step in trying to cushion the financial impact from the spreading infection rates, the Associated Press has reported. That comes as the latest negative impact from the novel coronavirus leading to new job losses. The casino results for March in the state crashed by 60%.</p>
<p>According to the media, some 161 workers will part ways with L’Auberge Hotel and Casino in Baton Rouge. Another 441 workers will have to leave the company’s other venue, the L’Auberge Lake Charles casino.</p>
<p>The data has been quoted from the Louisiana Workforce Commission, which processed notices filed by Penn National Gaming. Another venue affected by the measure will be Boomtown Casino in Harvey with another 200 employees leaving the casino on August 15.</p>
<p>Additional 350 workers will be let go in Margaritaville Resort Casino, another Penn National Gaming property located in Bossier City.</p>
<p>Layoffs Now Replace Furloughs</p>
<p>While everybody expected layoffs to follow, so far, most workers have been only furloughed, which means that they are still considered a part of the company.</p>
<p>However, with the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the Untied States climbing, and people failing to comply with health and safety standards, layoffs are the next move that makes financial sense.</p>
<p>Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards originally shuttered the state’s casinos in March in a bid to slow down the spread of the virus. The measures did help put a dent in the rate of infections, but a hurried-up reopening in May sent cases up.</p>
<p>Other than safety measures and reduced capacity hurting business, demand hasn’t been the same, although most venues have been able to fill up their floors to the designated limit.</p>
<p>According to Eric Schippers, Penn National Gaming SVP of Public Affairs, who spoke to The Advocate, cautioned that while the company was reopening, most venues will operate at limited capacity in the “foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>“While we have been able to reopen most of our properties on a limited basis, the continued social distancing requirements and uncertain business volumes means our properties will not be able to resume normal operations for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, citing The Advocate and data from the Louisiana Workforce Commission, some 4,000 casino jobs will have been lost when the August layoffs come into effect.</p>
<p>The state has used the hiatus in casino gaming to try and decide on sports betting in the state and specifically the future of sports gambling.</p>
