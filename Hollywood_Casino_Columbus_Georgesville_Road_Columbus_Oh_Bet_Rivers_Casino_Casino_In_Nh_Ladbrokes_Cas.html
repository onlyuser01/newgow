<p>Provider of digital lottery and gaming solutions NeoGames announced that its subsidiary Pariplay has moved to significantly expand its reach in Sweden via a distribution agreement with ATG.</p>
<p>Delivering on Promises</p>
<p>The major distribution deal between Pariplay and ATG will see the Swedish sports betting and horse racing operator gain access via Pariplay’s Fusion aggregation platform to Wizard Games titles and other selected third-party game content.</p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement with Pariplay, Maria Allmér, head of Casino at ATG, focused on the operator’s promise “to offer exciting gaming experiences in a responsible and smooth way” to its customers.</p>
<p>“By partnering with Pariplay we will be able to further reinforce our product portfolio and enhance our offer in line with our promise,” she outlined.</p>
<p>The distribution deal will see players at ATG gain access to top-performing game titles, including Dragons of the North, Spirit of Mustang, 12 Super Hot Diamonds Extreme, and Jade King, among others, to further strengthen ATG’s first position on the Swedish market where the operator already holds more than 30% of the licensed market.</p>
<p>Besides the integration of Pariplay’s aggregation platform which boasts over 14,000 game titles provided by more than 80 game developer studios, the deal will enhance player value for the Swedish operator by giving it access to a suite of back-office conversion and retention tools.</p>
<p>Wide Player Demographic</p>
<p>For the Nasdaq-listed provider of iLottery and online casino solutions, NeoGames chief executive officer Moti Malul highlighted ATG’s credentials as a leading operator in Sweden where the brand is “well established and much loved…with a long history.”</p>
<p>“Since launching their online casino, it has gone from strength to strength,” Malul continued, expressing how excited everyone at NeoGames feels at the opportunity to help the operator engage with its fans by delivering “premium content that resonates well with a wide player demographic.”</p>
<p>The deal with ATG marks a significant expansion of Pariplay’s aggregation platform as at the end of 2021, the betting and horse racing operator had a customer base of 1.3 million.</p>
<p>ATG was recently fined SEK2 million ($188,000) by the Swedish gaming regulator for breaching regulatory provisions related to player self-exclusion options. ATG informed Spelinspektionen about the technical issue that prevented players from self-excluding for 15 days but the regulator considered it a serious failure and imposed the hefty financial sanction.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s expansion in Sweden followed shortly after another step the content aggregator made in Latin America last month where it obtained a license in Panama to be able to legally offer its content to local operators.</p>
