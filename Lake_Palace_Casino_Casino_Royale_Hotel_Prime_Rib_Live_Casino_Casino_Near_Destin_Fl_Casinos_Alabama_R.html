    <h1>Lake Palace Casino Casino Royale Hotel Prime Rib Live Casino Casino Near Destin Fl Casinos Alabama R</h1>

<p>Dear Jan,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://regalscasino.com/en/terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>"TERMINATION OF THE TERMS OF USE CLOSURE AND TERMINATION BY YOU</p>
<p>If there is no debt to us or any other Third side, you can close Your Account and terminate the Terms of Use on not less than twenty four hours’ notice to us at any time. You can contact our Customer Services Department - support@Regalscasino.com for noticing us about your decision.</p>
<p>In request for closure of the account you may mention:</p>
<p>● the objective of your request (closure of the account);</p>
<p>● the reason of your decision (in particular if you are going to close your account because of concerns over the level of Your use of the Services. We will reply to your request after getting it. There will be a confirmation of closure of the account and the date, when this closure will be effective. Account Holder, for his part, commits to continue to assume responsibility for all activity on Your Account until such closure has been carried out by us (at which point the Terms of Use shall terminate).</p>
<p>Any outstanding balance in your Account will be returned to you after your requesting of account closure. You will get back your funds from account, if there is no debt to us or any other Third side (debt, related to your account)."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to the email address above. In this way you’ll have a proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
