<p>Natalia,</p>
<p>The bank account number may very well exist, correct but not when it corresponds directly with a BSB number, the BSB Number for my Bank &amp; Branch is correct as 923-100 so I’m sorry but the info. you have relayed above is erroneous &amp; I have now had it confirmed in concrete twice over by my bank that this account number beginning with a 5 not a 6 as it should be, does NOT exist. As far as the flash communications go, I can forward you the email that I sent them, the other was performed via their online web chat platform &amp; nothing was sent onto me from it, as I had it opening just left waiting for hrs on end after they informed me they would go &amp; investigate further after I told them what I have said to you in the above, they NEVER came back to me &amp; it was disconnected, again, I am left just sitting, waiting &amp; wasting what little time I have remaining trying to get these damn funds I am so overdue lay owed and then some now after going on now 9wks. I will forward you what I now also know Zoome has had in their possession since day one &amp; would NOT forward onto me in the transactional details of the one causing me nothing but further stress, duress &amp; illness to be totally &amp; brutally frank with you all on the subject. As far as the communications between my bank &amp; myself, that has, as I have already disclosed to you in the above, been via Verbal / Phone communications so if you are wanting that confirmation then I shall have to await their business hours call times here in Australia &amp; be on what I foresee to be yet another day of mine totally wasted in just waiting to get hold of whom I need to speak to after relaying all info. to each phone service rep. in the first instance so that they may place my call appropriately, ING do NOT have physical branches, all is totally remote via web &amp; phone platforms ONLY. But I will do this &amp; get the recording I said I can &amp; will have on record in the above text I sent earlier on for legal prosecutions should this not be resolved by COB 5:00pm AEST on Friday, 14th July 2023.</p>
<p>Please see what I have accessible right now in what you have requested in the above &amp; formal proof from my Bank I shall obtain in full later today just to prove even further that I have been &amp; am still being totally &amp; utterly lied to &amp; my too too long awaited, overdue &amp; OWED WINNINGS of $1,500.00 are being withheld from me, their RIGHTFUL RECIPIENT!!!</p>
<p>Zoome DO NOT EVEN HAVE A DAMN CLUE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OR WHAT TUEY ARE EVEN DOING, is that not evident enough in their woeful forms of communications &amp; the total lack their of just in the above alone???!!! I’m sorry Natalia &amp; please, I mean zero disrespect to you or in what you are trying to assist me in achieving here but pls understand my standpoint, especially given that I have been nothing but forthcoming in full with evidence etc. etc. all @ the absolute ready for you &amp; your disposal here, ZOOME, well, I know that I sure as hell can definitely NOT say the same for in any way, shape or form &amp; im sure you can also agree whether you are permitted to say so or not out of integrity for your professionalism &amp; also, most importantly, for your job security.</p>
<p>Please see the attached.</p>
<p>I HAVE HAD &amp; WAITED MORE THAN WHAT SJOULD EVER EVER HAVE TO BE LONG ENOUGH NOW!!! I NEED RESULTS &amp; I WILL, WITH GOD AS MY WITNESS, PROSECUTE TO THE FULL EXTENTS OF THE LAW IF THIS IS NOT REMEDIED BY THE ABOVE DATE, TIME BY ZOOME CASINO!!!</p>
