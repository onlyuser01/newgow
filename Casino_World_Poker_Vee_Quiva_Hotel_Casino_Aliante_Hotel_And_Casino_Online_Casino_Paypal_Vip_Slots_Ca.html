<p>Real Luck Group and its prominent award-winning subsidiary Luckbox have announced the appointment of David Conde as the betting platform’s new head of data. Luckbox is a top-notch online provider of licensed real money esports and sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>Conde’s past employers include several reputable world-class companies such as Ericsson, iGaming, MoPlay, and Gaming 1. His new position, however, will involve optimizing customer acquisition and retention campaigns.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, advanced data marketing will become an essential aspect of customer acquisition efforts at Luckbox, which is on track to commence by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Work Smart, Not Hard: Use Data and AI</p>
<p>Real Luck Group CEO Thomas Rosander revealed that the company is trying to leverage the latest technologies to make Luckbox more competitive and attractive to customers:</p>
<p>“With sophisticated use of data and AI, we are able to offer each player a highly customized experience, so that everyone feels like a VIP. As we strive to build a scalable business to become a dominant player in the space.”</p>
<p>He also commented on the new hire arguing that Conde’s skills would drive revenues through increased conversion on the acquisition and lead to higher customer retention levels.</p>
<p>Using artificial intelligence and smart data analytics is de facto the new gold standard in the financial and betting industry. Currently, esports is estimated to reach up to 500 million customers worldwide and generate $1 billion in global revenues.</p>
<p>In September, the French startup company PandaScore raised $6 million to apply AI to esports. The recent popularity of esports puts massive pressure on young betting companies like Luckbox to perform well. PandaScore also teamed up with Loot.Bet in July to offer the operator esports betting odds.</p>
<p>Luckbox debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange in December 2020 and has been trading under the $LUCK ticker ever since. The company was followed by main competitor Rivalry, which was listed on the TSX just last week.</p>
<p>Both companies started as esports-first betting platforms but have gradually branched out to other verticals, such as casino and sports betting for a more comprehensive betting experience.</p>
<p>Luckbox’s Operations So Far</p>
<p>The company is an award-winning B2C betting operator and offers legal and real-time betting on established esports such as LoL, CS, Dota 2, StarCraft, StarCraft2, Valorant, Rainbow Six, Overwatch, and others. It also provides live streams, statistics on desktop and mobile devices and combines technology and data to offer a wide range of betting options to clients.</p>
<p>The company is registered in the Isle of Man, and holds a full license under the Online Gambling Regulation Act by the Isle of Man Gaming Supervision Commission. In July, Luckbox moved away from EveryMatrix’s betting platform and replaced it with Aspire Global’s instead.</p>
