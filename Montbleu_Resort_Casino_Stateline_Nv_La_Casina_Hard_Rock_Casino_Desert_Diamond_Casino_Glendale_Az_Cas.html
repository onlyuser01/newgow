<p>Wazdan, a leading provider of innovative casino content, has teamed up with Netwin, a leading iGaming operator in Italy. Under the agreement between the two parties, the supplier will inject content into the gambling company’s platform.</p>
<p>As per the deal, Wazdan will roll out cutting-edge gaming content on Netwin, providing it with many exciting titles that would engage Italian audiences. By enhancing its product offering with new games, Netwin will be able to channel more players toward its platform and retain existing customers.</p>
<p>By diversifying Netwin’s portfolio, Wazdan will not only help the operator appeal to local gamblers, but will also expand its own presence in Italy. The supplier noted that Italy is a key market for its business and that Italian players have demonstrated a strong appreciation of its gaming solutions.</p>
<p>Wazdan concluded that it expects the new partnership to “resonate strongly” with Italian audiences, reflecting the company’s commitment to deliver exciting content.</p>
