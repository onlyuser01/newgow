<p>BGaming, a leading studio and creator of iGaming content, has expanded its regional footprint in Latin America and Mexico in particular through a new link-up with Betmexico, a prominent online casino operator in the country.</p>
<p>The partnership will significantly bolster both companies’ product offerings, with BGaming welcoming the opportunity to grow locally in the Latin American region, and Betmexico hailing the arrival of a new set of games that offers players value-added products and engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>BGaming is the author of more than 100 games that have become global hits and are now going to be available to Mexican players as well. Among the games that BGaming has to offer are titles such as Fruit Million, Joker Queen, Wild Cash and other classic and brand-new releases, all the while the supplier continues to create more games and add them to its portfolio.</p>
<p>BGaming has hailed this opportunity, arguing that it would significantly expand its local presence in the market and continue to create solutions that are tailored to the needs of local players. Speaking about this opportunity, BGaming Latin America Business Development Specialist Paulina Hovar said that this new tie-up provides Mexican players with access to top-performing BGaming titles.</p>
<p>"As a result, we’ll deepen our understanding of LatAm players and tailor our games to regional preferences by integrating features and mechanics favored in the market," Hovar explained in a press statement. Betmexico was similarly pleased with the opportunity to strengthen its library of titles with top-performing games of an established track record, and added that together with BGaming, the operator was looking to offer brand-new opportunities to players.</p>
<p>The games have already been well-received in Mexico, said the operator, and added that the two companies would work on growing the supplier’s footprint in the country moving forward. Speaking of growth, BGaming has been doing pretty well for itself. The company teamed up with Geogrator, a Georgia-compliant content aggregation platform, allowing the supplier to break ground into even more markets and with new operators, and their audiences.</p>
<p>BGaming’s successes do not stop there either. The company was recently shortlisted in three categories for the upcoming EGR B2B Awards 2023, demonstrating the company’s unwavering commitment to building and producing top-performing products.</p>
