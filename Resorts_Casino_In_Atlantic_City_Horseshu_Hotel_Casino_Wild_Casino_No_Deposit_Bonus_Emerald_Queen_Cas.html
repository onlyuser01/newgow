<p>International sports betting operator Parimatch continues to expand its presence in top-flight soccer competitions in Europe and the UK after signing a three-club agreement with clubs from the English Premier League (EPL).</p>
<p>Parimatch Signs Three-Club Partnership</p>
<p>Parimatch announced it signed a three-club agreement on August 21 to add Aston Villa, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Southampton to its portfolio of EPL partnerships and expand its brand’s presence in the top-flight soccer league in the UK to 30%.</p>
<p>Similar to the deal Parimatch signed with 2020-2021 UEFA Champions League Winners Chelsea early in August, the agreement with Villa, the Seagulls and the Saints allows the sports betting operator to utilize multiple offline and digital rights, ticketing, club merchandise and hospitality initiatives, as well as access to club assets for joint projects, promotions and giveaways.</p>
<p>We are delighted to welcome Parimatch as a new commercial partner. Parimatch shares our club values of being ambitious and forward-thinking, and we look forward to working with them for the season ahead.” Sarah Batters, Director, Marketing and Partnerships, Southampton FC</p>
<p>The new partnership, which brings the total number of EPL clubs linked with Parimatch to six after previous agreements with Everton and Leicester, also expands the sponsorship portfolio of Aston Villa, adding the European sports betting brand to the likes of eToro, Monster Energy and OB Sports as the new season in the EPL is underway.</p>
<p>This is an exciting announcement for the club, bringing onboard an international brand like Parimatch who match our growth ambitions. This partnership will enable us to bring even more opportunities to our fans, and we look forward to what we can achieve together.” Nicola Ibbetson, Chief Commercial Officer, AstonVilla FC</p>
<p>Shared Values and Spirit</p>
<p>Speaking about the deal, Parimatch CEO Roman Syrotian outlined the pride everyone at the company derives from its “determined expansion into global sports propositions,” highlighting the fact that the new club additions to the company’s portfolio of partnerships signify that “30% of the English Premier League shares our values and our spirit.”</p>
<p>Being in awe of these club’s histories and hoping to contribute to their future success, Parimatch is looking forward to utilizing the opportunities presented by these mutual agreements, Parimatch Tech CEO Syrotian concluded.</p>
<p>The Cyprus-headquartered sports betting brand, which rebranded to Parimatch Tech in July 2021, has a strong presence in other European top-flight soccer leagues, including Italian Serie A, where it has a partnership deal with Juventus. Parimatch has also been an official betting partner of Spanish La Liga since October 2020.</p>
