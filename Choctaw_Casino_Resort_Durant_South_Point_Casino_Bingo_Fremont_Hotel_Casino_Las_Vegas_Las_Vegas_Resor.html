    <h1>Choctaw Casino Resort Durant South Point Casino Bingo Fremont Hotel Casino Las Vegas Las Vegas Resor</h1>

<p>There are complete scumbags.</p>
<p>First they didn't credit my deposit at all it took forever and they actually had the nerve to force me to search the blockchain instead of them looking up the wallet address and transaction supplied by them to me which I don't even know how to do.</p>
<p>The scam goes like this they let you register if you live in the United States (I don't use a VPN my IP address clearly shows I'm from the United States)(they don't even ask you for your name or where you live when you register before sending you to the deposit page)</p>
<p>My deposit went into my account and they kept it. When I went to play a game there is a drop-down list for what country you live in and the United States is not an option so I went to chat and said I live in the United States why was I allowed to register and deposit?</p>
<p>I never even got to play a game. While in with chat they literally closed my account. And they stole my money.</p>
<p>So what happens is when you go to cash out if you do get by and manage to play they will ask you for verification documents and when you send them something back saying you live in the United States they will keep all of your deposits and all of your winnings if you have any.</p>
<p>It's a no lose situation for them.</p>
<p>If you lose they win. And if you win they win because they just tell you they're not going to pay you because you're in the United States anyway and shouldn't have been playing (every legitimate online casino that does not serve us players immediately notifies you when you enter the site that they did not accept customers from your jurisdiction).</p>
<p>They intentionally do not do this so they can steal your money.</p>
<p>I promise you any good reviews you see about this casino or paid they are from affiliates or from casino employees themselves.</p>
<p>Dig deeper and you will see they do this to everyone steal their money.</p>
