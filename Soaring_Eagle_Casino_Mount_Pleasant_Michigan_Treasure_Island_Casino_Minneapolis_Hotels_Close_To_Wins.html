    <h1>Soaring Eagle Casino Mount Pleasant Michigan Treasure Island Casino Minneapolis Hotels Close To Wins</h1>

<p>I have previously encountered issues with Betinia. Their verification process never seems to end. Eventually, I gambled away all my money. After a month, they contacted me stating my account had been verified. So, I cautiously deposited 100, won a few hundred, and withdrew it. It went through, showing up in my account within minutes. That was the last time.</p>
<p>On January 11, I made a withdrawal of 5625 krona. Given that my account is fully verified and they claim to have fast withdrawals, I was surprised when the money was not in my account the next day. I contacted the chat support the next morning (a Saturday), and they said it was pending. No issues, sometimes it can take a bit longer.</p>
<p>Sunday: Still, no money in my account. I contacted the chat support again. The chat team seemed indifferent; they kept pasting the same information over and over, stating they sent it to the finance department, and that "it's coming".</p>
<p>Monday: Same situation, same indifferent chat. At this point, I was beginning to get frustrated. Getting a response to a question could take up to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But Tuesday was the real shocker. It was straight out of a mafia film; I could scarcely believe that this could occur in a Swedish licensed company. I reached out to the chat support and they initiated the verification process once again!!! I was fuming.</p>
<p>I told the chat support that I wanted my money now and that I was not going to gamble away another penny if they thought delaying the process would lead to that. I asked them to clarify what needs to be verified this time around. Suddenly, the chat agent started asking about my mental health (in a snide way), suggesting I speak with a family member, and began sending links to suicide prevention websites. I asked them to maintain professionalism and answer my question, to which they replied "now we are escalating this...", followed by deleting my account and blocking my IP so that I couldn't reach chat support again.</p>
<p>I changed my IP and asked why they had done that, at which point they exited the chat and blocked my "new" IP.</p>
<p>Now, here I am, unable to contact them with my account closed. I am determined to take this all the way but I'm starting here. I have attached the chat logs and all documentation from our last chat.</p>
<p>Just because I insisted on getting my money, the chat agent started to ridicule my mental health (totally unwarranted excuse to delete the account), then proceeded to delete my account. Now I am also blocked from the chat support, left with no way to contact them.</p>
<p>I couldn't attach all the screenshots, there are many, nor the videos I recorded. Is there some other way I can submit them?</p>
