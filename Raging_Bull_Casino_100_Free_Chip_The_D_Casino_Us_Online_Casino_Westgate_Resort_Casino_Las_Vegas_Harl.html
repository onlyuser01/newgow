<p>Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. We appreciate your patience and understand the importance of resolving this matter promptly. We would like to address the inquiry regarding the blocking of the player's account without the obligation to pay the winnings.</p>
<p>Verification procedures at BETSSEN Casino are integral to our Risk Management protocols, aiming to ensure a secure and fair gaming environment for all players. Each player is subject to a comprehensive verification process, where specific documents, and sometimes additional information, are requested. Our KYC Policy, outlined in detail on our website [https://www.betssen.com/en/promotions/live-casino?helpPageContent=109739], provides transparency to all our players regarding these procedures.</p>
<p>Upon conducting a thorough verification/investigation of the player in question, our Risk Management team identified patterns consistent with Arbitrage betting. This activity is explicitly prohibited under section 13 "Late bets and arbitrage betting" of our General Terms and Conditions, which is accessible to all players on our website.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this violation, the player's bets were returned, the deposit was refunded, and the account was closed. We strive to uphold the integrity of our gaming platform and enforce policies that ensure fair play for all users.</p>
<p>To provide evidence supporting our decision, we kindly request that you respond to this message with a private email address. Unfortunately, we cannot disclose sensitive information publicly, but we are committed to addressing your concerns and providing the necessary evidence in a secure manner.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to resolving this matter with you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>BETSSEN.</p>
