<p>The Brazilian Football Confederation has appointed Eduardo Gussem as the integrity officer of the newly created Integrity Unit aimed at fighting against sports betting manipulation</p>
<p>Brazil’s soccer governing body founded in 1914, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), has announced the creation of a new Integrity Unit that will be led by former attorney general of Rio, Eduardo Gussem.</p>
<p>The Need for “Fast, Sustainable and Effective” Cooperation</p>
<p>From his new position as integrity officer, Gussem will carry on the important fight against manipulation in sports betting, in accordance with CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues’ commitment to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and member body Conmebol responsible for organizing and governing South American soccer’s major international tournaments.</p>
<p>Rodrigues was also the one who recommended Gussem for the important position. The appointment will go into effect starting November 27, 2023. As explained by Rodrigues, in order for the battle against the manipulation of sports competitions to be successful, a mix of “agile, fast, sustainable and effective” cooperation, open dialogue, and strong cooperation between sports and competition organizations, and operators is mandatory.</p>
<p>This needs to take place at both a domestic and a global level, added the president of the soccer league which expressed its desire to receive 4% of sportsbooks’ revenue in April as a means of revolutionizing the gaming system and further supporting different clubs and teams.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in May, Brazil’s Justice Minister, Flávio Dino, launched a national investigation probing the soccer scene for match-fixing with results carrying potential “international repercussions.”</p>
<p>Finally, Rodrigues strongly believes in the ongoing ability of the newly formed integrity unit to find “common effective responses to the challenges posed by the problem.”</p>
<p>The New Unit Is “a Pioneering Structure”</p>
<p>The former head of the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro who was involved in the notorious case of the “rachadinha” that involved Senator Flávio Bolsonaro spoke about the new unit, calling it “a great honor to be able to serve Brazilian football by bringing security and rigidity to competitions.”</p>
<p>Gussem also spoke about their “aim to bring rigidity and security” to soccer by answering current questions tied to the problem of betting and the manipulation of sports results while building fast solutions helpful for fans, the public, and the entire world of soccer.</p>
<p>The new integrity officer called the challenge “enormous” while explaining that he was entirely aware of the responsibility that he was given.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that FIFA has already shown signs that the Integrity Unit, which he called “a new and pioneering structure,” was a true pilot at a global level.</p>
<p>In April, Brazil’s government announced a 15% tax on online betting along with a $5.9 million license fee.</p>
