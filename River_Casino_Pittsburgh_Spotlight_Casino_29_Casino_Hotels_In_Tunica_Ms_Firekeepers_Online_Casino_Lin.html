<p>According to a new report from the Danish Gambling Authority (Spillemyndigheden), Danish citizens above the age of 18 spent an average of DKK2,350 ($345) on gambling in 2022.</p>
<p>Iceland Leads Nordic Region in Gambling Spending</p>
<p>With an average gambling expenditure of DKK 2,350 ($345), Denmark ranked 12th in terms of gambling spending in Europe for 2022. When compared to other Nordic countries, Denmark had the lowest average spending per adult. Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland all had higher average gambling expenditures per adult. Iceland had the highest gambling consumption in the Nordic region with DKK 3,300 ($484) per capita. Looking at Europe as a whole, Ireland tops the list with an average gambling spend of just under DKK 4,000 ($587) per capita in 2022.</p>
<p>In 2022, 60% of all gambling activities in Denmark took place through online channels such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. This places Denmark fourth among European countries in terms of online gambling. However, the Danish Gambling Authority emphasized that they still oversee physical gambling markets, including casinos and gaming halls, in addition to online gambling.</p>
<p>Anders Dorph, director of the Danish Gambling Authority, stated, “Despite the majority of Danish gambling taking place online, it is essential for us to continue regulating the physical gambling market, including casinos and gaming halls, to ensure compliance with the law.”</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of online gambling can be attributed to the general technological advancements in society in recent years.</p>
<p>Despite the strict regulations on gambling that Denmark enforces, in May the Danish Gambling Authority shared data on its StopSpillet helpline, revealing that the majority of individuals seeking help for gambling problems had started gambling at a young age, with 50% having started before the legal age of 18.</p>
<p>Regulator’s Report Provides Comprehensive Overview of Danish Market</p>
<p>The figures mentioned in the report, titled “Gambling Market in Figures 2022,” provide a comprehensive overview of the Danish gambling market, including the most popular games, the number of individuals registered in the self-exclusion registry (ROFUS), and the amount of money spent by Danish gamblers.</p>
<p>Anders Dorph expressed his satisfaction with the annual publication, stating that it offered the regulator and gambling industry stakeholders valuable insights into various aspects of the gambling market in Denmark, providing a comprehensive overview of the current trends.</p>
<p>The Danish Gambling Authority has been actively enhancing its understanding of regulated gambling and has recently become a member of the United Lotteries for Integrity in Sports, indicating its commitment to ensuring the integrity of sports within its regulatory jurisdiction.In other news, the regulator announced just days ago that it is no longer subject to enhanced confidentiality rules after a decision by the Danish National Tax Tribunal. However, the authority still needs to adhere to the general duty of confidentiality, which restricts the disclosure of information related to natural persons, trade secrets, and other sensitive details protected under data protection legislation.</p>
