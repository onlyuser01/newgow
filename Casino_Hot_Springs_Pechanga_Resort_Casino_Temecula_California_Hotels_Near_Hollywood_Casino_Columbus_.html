<p>The leading gaming and technology company, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, announced a senior-level nomination on Wednesday. The company revealed that it nominated Bill G. Lance Jnr as a Non-Executive Director.</p>
<p>Although the nomination is valid as of October 19, 2022, it remains subject to relevant customary regulatory pre-approvals. After the nomination, Aristocrat's shareholders will be asked to elect Lance as a Non-Executive Director of the company. The election is expected to be completed during the company's Annual General Meeting planned for February next year.</p>
<p>Neil Chatfield, Aristocrat's Chairman, said in a statement released on October 19, 2022: "I am delighted to welcome a Director of Bill's caliber to the Board." Moreover, he added: "His decades of experience as a major gaming operator and a Tribal leader of national standing in the US will bring valuable new perspectives to the Board's deliberations." According to Chatfield, having Lance as a Non-Executive Director will boost the company's customer focus. Last but not least, Aristocrat's Chairman congratulated Lance for his nomination.</p>
<p>Lance is a prominent Native American Tribal Leader in the US with decades of experience within the gaming and entertainment industry. What's more, he was the longest-serving Secretary of Commerce for the Chickasaw Nation. While a part of the leading Tribal nation, Lance was in charge of 7,000 employees, as well as more than 60 hospitality, gaming and entertainment locations.</p>
<p>Aristocrat explained that with Lance stepping down from the position of Secretary of Commerce he was "given the honorary title of the Chickasaw Nation's Secretary of State as part of a planned succession."</p>
<p>Besides the Chickasaw Nation, Lance serves on the Board of Directors of BancFirst, a NASDAQ-listed company. He is also a part of the Chickasaw Foundation where he serves as a member of the Board. His professional experience includes member of the Board positions with the Oklahoma Department of Commerce Advisory Council, as well as Trustees for the University of Oklahoma Foundation.</p>
<p>The recent nomination comes after only recently, Aristocrat collected multiple awards at the Global Gaming Expo. Last week, the company was named Land-based Industry Supplier of the Year, marking the fourth such award for Aristocrat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company's Wild Wild Buffalo slot was selected as Slot of the Year. This award marked the fifth such achievement for Aristocrat. Additionally, Trevor Crocker, the company's CEO and Managing Director, was awarded the newly created ESG Award "Excellence in Sustainable Gaming."</p>
