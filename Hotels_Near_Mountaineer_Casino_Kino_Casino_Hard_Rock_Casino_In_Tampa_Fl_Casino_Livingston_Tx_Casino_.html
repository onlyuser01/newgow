<p>Cash Box review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Cash Box is a banking-themed online slot game from Pragmatic Play. The game puts a twist on traditional slot play, with the reels being fully populated with vaults instead of symbols.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has kept the design of the Cash Box slot extremely simple. From the slot design, it is not clear whether it is supposed to be based around a bank vault or some sort of TV show. The reels are full of bank vaults that open to reveal prizes, but the backdrop features stage lightning and looks as though it could be from some sort of TV show.</p>
<p>Either way, the slot’s design is not likely to live long in the memory, with the whole thing feeling a little bit generic.</p>
<p>Nice win in the Cash Box slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cash Box’s base game is different from your standard online slot. The game has five reels and three rows, but there are no traditional paylines. Instead, vaults will open up on each spin and reveal either a Cash Prize, a Jackpot, or a Free Spins symbol.</p>
<p>To win a prize, players will need to land three on one spin. The prizes are multipliers of x0.05, x0.1, x0.25, x0.5, x1, x2.5, x5, x25, and x50.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Cash Box does not have a huge deal to offer in terms of bonuses. As well as Cash Prizes, players can win jackpots in the game. These are won by matching three Jackpot symbols. The Mini, Major, and Grand Jackpots are worth 40x, 500x, and 5,000x your stake, respectively.</p>
<p>The other bonus is the Free Spins round. This is triggered when you land three or more Scatter symbols. Three, four, or five Scatters rewards 10, 15, or 20 spins, respectively.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you will be able to buy your way into the Free Spins round for 100x your stake.</p>
<p>3 Scatters award 10 Free Spins in the Cash Box slot machine</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The maximum amount that can be won in the Cash Box slot game is 5,000x your stake. The RTP is 96.02%, which is around average according to our slot strategy guide. The volatility has been rated 4.5/5 by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The stake is adjusted by clicking on the +/- buttons on either side of the spin button. The minimum wager is $0.20, and the maximum is $100.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has tried to do something different with the Cash Box slot game, but for the most part, it falls flat. The different gameplay style is not hugely captivating, and the slot fails to do anything majorly interesting with the concept. That said, a solid RTP and a 5,000x maximum win do make up for this a little bit.</p>
