<p>Kings of Cash review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Kings of Cash is another Microgaming clone of a series with highly idiosyncratic naming conventions revolving around royalty and hard currency.</p>
<p>This one is as good as any other with the Kings of the title being the card from the deck brought to life and given thrones, crowns, and swag bags in the light-hearted cartoon imagery of the reels.</p>
<p>The theme is a bit thin as they go, the background is just a velvet hanging and the symbols are very limited in variety. That said, the overall tone of the game is not unappealing, but it is not going to entice everybody.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are in that Microgaming sweet spot of being relatively flawless, but also completely lacking any excellence. There is little to criticise in the choice and design of images on the reels, but there’s also nothing about them to grab the attention of the player.</p>
<p>The animations are similarly basic, doing their job well, but with very little élan.</p>
<p>The spin and win sounds are perfectly fine as are the limited background tracks, but here too Kings of Cash has mustered just enough effort to not actively annoy its players.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Kings of Cash is played on your bog-standard five reel layout, with three rows and fifteen winlines.</p>
<p>It comes with two types of bonus – a picking game and a free spin bonus (full details below) – which is a solid showing for a slot that isn’t pushing to be anything more than good at doing what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the two types of Scatter symbols. There are no multipliers in this game for Wild symbol wins.</p>
<p>5 of a kind win in the base game</p>
<p>The two Scatter symbols are the Dollar symbol and Crown symbol. These symbols do not need to be on a winline for the player to win.</p>
<p>Three or more Dollar symbols anywhere on the reels trigger a cash payout and a free spin bonus. The more Dollar symbols over three the player hits, the bigger the cash payout and the more free spins the player is awarded.</p>
<p>Three Dollar symbols win one time the player’s bet plus ten free spins, while five Dollar symbols net ten times the bet and 25 free spins.</p>
<p>Three or more Crown symbols anywhere on the reels trigger a picking game in which twelve cards are dealt face down. Each card has a multiplier amount on it. The player is awarded a payout equal to their bet per spin multiplied by the number on the first three matching cards they turn over.</p>
<p>The more Crown symbols the player hits, the bigger the range of multipliers on the cards. With a max payout for five Crown symbols of 1000 times the bet.</p>
<p>Hit 3 or more Crown symbols and play a bonus game</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.60%, a nice 0.6 percentage points over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€75.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Visually, Kings of Cash is the very definition of not bad. It avoids making any big mistakes and is competently put together. It lacks any kind of spark or pizzazz, but that isn’t necessarily the worst thing.</p>
<p>The gameplay provides everything you’d expect and not a jot more.</p>
<p>Its main appeal is not in its gameplay or visuals, but in its volatility and RTP. The high volatility and RTP of 96.60% makes this a good match for our slot machine strategy, and wins this slot our recommendation.</p>
