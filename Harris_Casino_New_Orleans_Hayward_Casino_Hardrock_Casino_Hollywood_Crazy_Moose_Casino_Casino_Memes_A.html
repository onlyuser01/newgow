    <h1>Harris Casino New Orleans Hayward Casino Hardrock Casino Hollywood Crazy Moose Casino Casino Memes A</h1>

<p>Atlanta United vs. DC United is played on Saturday, June 10, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, where the hosts are 5-0-2 against the boys from the capital</p>
<p>Atlanta United is the team with the highest roster value in the MLS at the moment (until Lionel Messi comes to Inter Milan). This is a rich team, but the boys from Georgia aren’t doing as you’d expect from them. They’re without a win in their last four MLS games and are facing a very tricky opponent this Saturday. Managed by Wayne Rooney, DC United looks like a real giant slayer in 2023.</p>

<p>Atlanta United in Need of a Win</p>
<p>Coached by Steve Cherundolo, Atlanta United’s done okay since the start of the 2023 MLS season. This team is sitting in the No. 5 position in the Eastern Conference with 25 points after 17 matches. Atlanta’s record is 6-7-4 with a score differential of 33-24. This makes Cherundolo’s team one of the highest-scoring teams in the MLS, but also one of the teams with the worst defense in the league.</p>
<p>The poor defending of “The Five Stripes” has caused them to drop points numerous times this season, but especially over the last couple of weeks. In fact, Atlanta Utd drew each of its last four MLS, two of which finished with the score 3-3.</p>
<p>Brad Guzan. RIDICULOUS.</p>

<p>In their most recent MLS game, Cherundolo’s men did do great at the back. They drew 0-0 with the MLS Cup holder LAFC in Los Angeles last Wednesday. Los Angeles FC players had 22 goal attempts, while Atlanta’s made just four, none of which were directed toward the net.</p>
<p>Atlanta’s goalie Brad Guzan was brilliant in that game, saving nine shots. He even saved a penalty by Carlos Vela but stepped out of the goal line too soon, so it was repeated. And Vela sent the ball into row Z on the second attempt.</p>
<p>DC United Is the Kind of Team Atlanta Hates Playing Against</p>
<p>Atlanta United is playing home on Saturday, so “parking the bus” in front of the goal wouldn’t get much support from the stands. Plus, considering that Cherundolo’s boys are 2-5-3 in their last 10 MLS games, the pressure is on them to show up and win three points on Saturday.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s very likely that we’ll see “The Five Stripes” on the front foot in the game with DC United. However, this doesn’t mean Wayne Rooney’s boys will actually suffer. On the contrary, they love it when the opposition has the ball. At least, that’s the case when they’re faced with tough opponents such as Atlanta United.</p>

<p>The “Black-and-Reds” have the luxury to play defensively and look for their chances on the break. It’s because they have the big guy Christian Benteke as the lone striker. The former Liverpool and Crystal Palace target man is 6’3, weighing almost 190 pounds.</p>
<p>On Benteke’s flanks are pacey wingers like Taxiarchis Fountas and Cristian Dajome, who can outrun almost any defender. Coach Wayne Rooney also has some amazing midfielders at his disposal who can slice Atlanta’s defense apart with their passes. The men in question are Lewis O’Brian, Mateusz Klitch, Theodore Ku-DiPietro, and others.</p>
<p>Atlanta United vs. DC United Prediction</p>
<p>We expect Atlanta United to attack throughout the game, but it will only take one good counterattack (or a set-piece) for DC United to score. That’s why we think the visitors won’t lose on Saturday. But can they beat Atlanta in Georgia? We’re not so sure about that. Instead, we think that the most plausible outcome is a draw.</p>
<p>Pick: Atlanta United and DC United to draw; both teams to score</p>
