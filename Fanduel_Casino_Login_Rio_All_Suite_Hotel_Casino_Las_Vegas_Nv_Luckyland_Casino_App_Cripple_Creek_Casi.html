<p>Rush Street Interactive has launched its second online casino on top of its existing sportsbook in Pennsylvania as a BetRivers-branded platform.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Welcomes BetRivers Online Casino</p>
<p>After the successful launch of SugarHouse, Rush Street Interactive Pennsylvania, the Keystone State subsidiary of Rush Street Gaming, is pushing ahead with a second quality online casino platform in PA – BetRivers.</p>
<p>BetRivers will focus on bringing forth the same quality of games, flexible banking options and accessible overall interface as SugarHouse. Furthermore, Rush Street now operates both a sportsbook and an iGaming portal under the same website to guarantee better synergies for players.</p>
<p>Sports fans and casino players can use a single wallet to switch between both skins of the website and guarantee themselves a versatile experience.</p>
<p>A Look at BetRivers Online Casino Content</p>
<p>BetRivers offers players a 100% match bonus up to $250 that comes with a 1X wagering requirement, the lowest in the market to date.</p>
<p>The low rollover requirement was what won SugarHouse, Rush Street’s other brand in the state, its popularity, and the company is pushing with a second identical offer. In terms of games, the casino has covered several categories, including:</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Progressive Jackpots</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Table &amp; Card Games</p>
<p>The portfolio numbers over 60 viable titles, including popular online slot machines, such as Gonzo’s Quest, Jimi Hendrix Online Slot, and Motorhead Online Slot. BetRivers online casino PA also fully displays each betting limit and paylines in a small preview caption underneath each title.</p>
<p>BetRivers will also become part of iRush Rewards, SugarHouse’s existing loyalty program that allows players to climb through numerous tiers and claim various rewards, including expedited payments, a personal manager, and more.</p>
<p>Bet on the Main Sports Events</p>
<p>BetRivers is up and running on time for several big sporting events this year, including the Super Bowl and March Madness, after the bookmaker officially opened for business in October 2019.</p>
<p>According to RSI President Richard Schwartz, the launch of the sportsbook is not by chance and the company has been looking to add another brand to help it capture the bulk of sports handle going in the way of Super Bowl LIV this year.</p>
<p>He further had to add:</p>
<p>“Our experience in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with PlaySugarHouse.com, has validated that online sportsbook players also enjoy the full-services of our casinos, especially the table games.”</p>
<p>As a more liberal market, New Jersey was the first venue for Rush Street Interactive where it launched both a casino and sportsbook before officially launching PlaySugarHouse.com in Pennsylvania in July 2019, a year after PASPA was cancelled.</p>
<p>Commenting on the most recent developments, Schwartz said that the brands under the company have kept on growing thanks to the quality of the user experience. Fast payment options and responsive customer support were also key to the company’s success, he noted.</p>
<p>Edited: A previous version of the article implied that BetRivers launched both a sportsbook and an online casino last week. That was incorrect. BetRivers had already launched its sportbooks in PA in October, 2019 as we previously reported. This has been amended.</p>
