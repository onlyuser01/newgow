<p>Jackpocket, an innovative lottery ticket selling app, announced its expansion into New Mexico in partnership with one of the largest convenience store chains in the US and New Mexico lottery retailers, Circle K.</p>
<p>Looking for First Big Winner in the Land of Enchantment</p>
<p>Following the launch of the Jackpocket app, New Mexicans can securely order official state lottery tickets for lottery games such as Mega Millions, Powerball, Lotto America, Pick3, Pick 4, and Roadrunner Cash from the comfort of their mobile phones.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Jackpocket’s chief executive officer and founder Peter Sullivan outlined the “long-standing history” Circle K has “as one of the top lottery retailers in New Mexico,” and was eager to bring the Jackpocket app to both “long-time lottery fans and brand new players.”</p>
<p>“Lottery players have won over $130 million in prizes so far on Jackpocket, and we can’t wait to meet our first big winner in the Land of Enchantment. Jackpocket is committed to continuously innovating the digital gaming space in a safe and meaningful way.” Peter Sullivan, CEO and Founder, Jackpocket</p>
<p>The launch in New Mexico made the state the 11th to feature the third-party lottery service app that seeks to broaden access to lottery products in a convenient, digital way. The Jackpocket app has granted over $130 million in lottery prizes to date as 11 individuals have registered prizes of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>The app which is not directly affiliated with the New Mexico Lottery has in-built capabilities to allow players to view an image of the ticket they have bought, check lottery results, organize and join lottery pools with friends and families, and win up to $600.</p>
<p>‘Fun, Exclusive and Convenient’ Lottery Experience</p>
<p>For Jackpocket’s partner Circle K, Melissa Lessard, head of North American marketing, spoke about the high hopes the convenience store brand places on the partnership with Jackpocket to bring “this fun, exclusive and convenient experience” to the lottery players across New Mexico.</p>
<p>“Providing the opportunity for customers to order official state lottery tickets with just the tap of a button through the Jackpocket app is yet another example of our commitment to making their lives a little easier every day.” Melissa Lessard, Head, North American Marketing, Circle K</p>
<p>As a third-party provider of lottery services, Jackpocket is not shying away from its responsibilities in terms of consumer protection, offering daily deposit and spend limits, self-exclusion, and access to responsible gaming resources via the app.</p>
<p>Member of the National Council on Problem Gambling, Jackpocket is also the first third-party lottery service to get certified by the council’s Internet Responsible Gambling Compliance Assessment Program.</p>
