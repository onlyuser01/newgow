<p>New South Wales has had its unpleasant business with gambling. There were Crown Resorts and The Star, and the recent turbulence in the gambling industry has galvanized lawmakers to act more decisively in tackling gambling-related crime and not least – harm. The latest attempt to curb problem gambling, though, has not struck home with everyone, as NSW plans to expand the use of facial recognition technology in order to scan the faces of gamblers and establish whether they have self-excluded, ABC News reported.</p>
<p>Some have called this dystopian, but the NSW is confident that the rollout of cameras throughout the state in 2023 will help address a crucial public health issue. The state wants to ensure that its Multi-Venue Self-Exclusion scheme is adhered to and that gamblers are not left to hang without any failsafe to help them extricate themselves from problem gambling.</p>
<p>There is not necessarily any regulatory or legal objection here as people who sign up for the Multi-Venue Self-Exclusion scheme will have provided their images voluntarily and consented to the image being used for the purposes of identifying whether a person is trying to access gambling products despite the prohibition. The cameras will be rolled out with pubs and clubs where many gamblers go outside of casinos.</p>
<p>Head of Liquor and Policing for Australian Hotels Association NSW John Green is confident that the use of such technology will actually be a positive thing in the end, as it will help problem gamblers to keep their habit at bay and for the owners of such establishments to ensure that their clientele is playing in a safe and responsible environment.</p>
<p>Green was pretty happy with the technology that is being deployed now. He noted that the cameras and facial recognition software were good enough to spot people out even if they were wearing masks or glasses in order to avoid detection. The tech, though, has become advanced enough to see through such ploys.</p>
<p>ClubsNSW CEO Josh Landis was another figurehead to get behind the suggestion. He ensured that the technology is going to be used to only target problem gamblers and people who have self-excluded specifically. It’s a solution that will help protect and aid those who are experiencing gambling-related distress.</p>
<p>This news is particularly auspicious and comes at the time when the United Kingdom is conducting its Safer Gambling Week dedicated to addressing and tackling problem gambling. Earlier this month, NSW announced the mass testing of cashless gaming technology designed to improve overall integrity and player protection.</p>
