<p>AffPapa, one of the world’s leading repositories of affiliates and operators, has negotiated a fresh partnership with Coinplay, an iGaming operator licensed by Curacao eGaming. The partnership sees Coinplay, an innovative brand and operator that provides sports betting and online casino games on top of crypto exchange services worldwide, strengthen its presence in the iGaming vertical and have access to one of the biggest vaults of potential partners.</p>
<p>Coinplay presently accepts more than 40 different types of cryptocurrencies and has a range of gaming options that will cater to any taste. Apart from live casino games and slots, Coinplay is also happy to offer sports as well as esports betting solutions, and the company is currently accessible in over 100 different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership, AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan welcomed the new partner and said that it would make a great fit for her company’s continuously growing depository of partners and operators. Avagyan said that Coinplay offers a lot of lucrative opportunities for other members of the AffPapa depository and especially those that are focusing on cryptocurrencies presently.</p>
<p>Coinplay was similarly excited to receive the news and commented that through AffPapa, the company would get tremendous exposure to broader markets and strike home with more trusted partners that can help it continue building up its international footprint.</p>
<p>AffPapa has been growing its footprint and directory at a robust pace. The company has had a number of successful onboardings over the past weeks and months, with AffPapa also teaming up with OlyBet, an operator, back in June, and having secured several prominent partnerships since.</p>
<p>Similarly, the AffPapa iGaming Club has proven a success with the next big-ticket event on the calendar now set for Barcelona, Spain on September 19 when the iGaming Club Barcelona 2023 will take place. AffPapa iGaming Club is a fairly new format but it is also one that has been an immediate success with global audiences.</p>
<p>The format has made it possible for affiliates to come together and network, exchange know-how, and also learn how to benefit from each other’s expertise by collaborating on specific projects.</p>
