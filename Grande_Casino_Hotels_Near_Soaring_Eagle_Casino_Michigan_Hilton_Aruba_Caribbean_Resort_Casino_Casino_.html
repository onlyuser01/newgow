    <h1>Grande Casino Hotels Near Soaring Eagle Casino Michigan Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort Casino Casino</h1>

<p>I just want them to return my R$0.54. It's minimal but as they unilaterally blocked my account after so much loss when they could just give me a cashback of solace I don't accept a penny from me in possession of this casino. No one will be able to counter the fact that they stole R$0.54 from me. Yes, they are thieves. They have my money, they blocked my account. Turn around. I only ask for help in this regard as a matter of morals and conscience. As long as they retain what is mine, I can only call them thieves. And new players need to know that. I've dealt with other casinos and the consideration is completely different. Anyone viewing this complaint please do not deposit at this casino. You will have headaches for sure.</p>
<p>Think: Why use a company in Brazil to quickly receive and process Pix deposits and create a very complicated withdrawal method in international transfer mode? Worse, how dare they respond that they only make withdrawals by the same deposit method to deceptively complicate? If the deposit was via pix, simply make a pix. People should know that this casino is not honest. It makes deposits easier and purposefully makes withdrawals difficult, programming the slots so that players lose their winnings. I understand my responsibility but everything is very well designed.</p>
<p>Fraudulent casino indeed. They can say what they want but they made it difficult for me to withdraw and they withheld my money. I have already emailed them with no response that I will communicate to domestic and international authorities by these methods. Who audits these software? It was all very bizarre.</p>
<p>I'll repeat: I didn't do anything with them and they are stealing from me. I demand a retraction and my money withheld back, even if it is litigious.</p>
<p>If you can help me on this moral issue I would be very grateful.</p>
