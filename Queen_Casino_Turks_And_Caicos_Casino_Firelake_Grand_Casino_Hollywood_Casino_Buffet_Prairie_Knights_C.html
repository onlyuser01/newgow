<p>UK Race Track Bookies Conspire to Rip Off Bettors, Says Whistle Blower</p>

<p>On-track bookies in the UK regularly collude to increase the vigorish at events they expect to be largely attended by inexperienced gamblers. That’s according to one on-track bookmaker, who admits he has taken part in such activity in the past but now “deplores” the practise.</p>

<p>Andy Smith, who takes bets as ‘Festival Racing,’ told The Guardian newspaper that bookmakers often agree before the racing begins to price up their books in a way that will leave more naive customers short-changed.</p>
<p>His comments came in the wake of a report by the Horseracing Bettors Forum that found particularly bad odds had been offered at the Welsh racetrack Ffos Las at an event marketed as “Ladies Day.”</p>
<p>Cooking the Books</p>
<p>While it’s generally accepted by bettors that all bookmakers give themselves a mathematical edge when they price up their books, some edges are greater than others.</p>
<p>In fixed-odds bookmaking, the sum of the probabilities quoted for any given race will always exceed 100 percent. Everything over the 100 percent mark equates to the bookmaker’s theoretical profit.</p>
<p>Normally, they can’t get too greedy because experienced gamblers will do the math, realize they’re getting a raw deal and move on. In a competitive betting market, the margin should be under 2 percent for each runner, but it appears the bookies at Ffos Las felt that the Ladies Day attendees might be not be so perceptive.</p>
<p>Practise Widespread</p>
<p>“Because there’s not many bookies,” Smith said, “it was easy to arrange, let’s think of a word for it … a cartel. A bookie would come and ask you, one of the other bookies. They might say, we’ll do 3 percent the first couple of races, then we’re betting 4 percent.</p>
<p>You might not believe this, but this is not a thing that happens only at Ffos Las. It’s happening more and more.”</p>
<p>Smith says that collusion is more likely to be found in “satellite” betting spots, away from the main betting area.</p>
<p>Mark Kershaw, director at Ffos Las, told The Guardian he was “disappointed” in the bookmakers at his racetrack.</p>
<p>“We try hard to get the racegoers there and it needs everybody at the racecourse to pull together to make sure they want to come back again and have a good experience,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think it was a day when there was a holiday crowd and they thought: ‘We can take advantage,’ but that’s completely wrong. What we want is that holiday crowd to want to come back again. It shouldn’t be an opportunity to short-change them.”</p>
