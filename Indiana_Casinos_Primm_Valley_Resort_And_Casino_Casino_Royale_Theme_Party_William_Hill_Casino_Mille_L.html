<p>Even though the Las Vegas Raiders are 0-3 in the 2022 season, oddsmakers see them as favorites in Week 4’s duel with the Denver Broncos. It seems as if they’re overdue getting their first win of the season but getting it against the Broncos on Sunday is not going to be easy.</p>
<p>The good news for the Raiders is that they’re 4-0 against the Broncos in this decade. The bad news is that the Broncos now have Russell Wilson as their quarterback, who’s expected to explode at any given moment.</p>

<p>Russell Wilson Needs to Step Up</p>
<p>In the offseason, Russell Wilson signed a contract with the Denver Broncos worth $325 million. Three weeks into the 2022 season, the quarterback still hasn’t shown he’s actually worth the salary.</p>
<p>So far, he’s thrown for 743 yards and just two touchdowns, along with one interception. Rushing-wise, he hasn’t done much better either – gaining just 22 yards in total for no TDs.</p>
<p>Knowing how unimpressive the QB has been, the fact that the Broncos are 2-1 in 2022 is actually an achievement worth praise. Still, their success doesn’t have to do much with their offense. Instead, their defensive team is their strongest weapon in the 2022 season. With just 336 points conceded, the Broncos have the best defense in the AFC.</p>
<p>Is it Time for the Raiders Offense to Get on Track?</p>
<p>We believe that the Raiders have one of the best offensive teams in the conference, even though they’ve been very disappointing so far. With players like Derek Carr (quarterback), Davante Adams (wide receiver), and Darren Waller (tight end), the Raiders are expected to produce a lot of points in every game.</p>
<p>In 2022, their average is 21.33, which isn’t too bad, but they need to do better. Their defense too needs to do a better job than in the first three games when they conceded a total of 77 points. To be fair to them, they did play against three teams famous for being good in the offense – the Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, and Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs Las Vegas Raiders Prediction</p>
<p>With the help of their fans at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders should be able to put on a decent performance on Sunday. Beating the Broncos isn’t going to be easy, but we think they’re going to manage. Whether they’re going to cover the spread in Week 4 comes with a big question mark.</p>
