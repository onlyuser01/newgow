<p>Rhino Entertainment Group is the pioneer operator to scoop up a direct license from the Curacao Gaming Control Board via White Star BV for the CasinoDays brand</p>
<p>The Malta-based, fast-growing online gaming operator employing a multi-brand strategy and managing four brands in reputable markets, Rhino Entertainment Group, has become the first operator to obtain a direct license from the Curacao Gaming Control Board (CGCB).</p>
<p>According to IGB and EGR Global, the operator that won the Employer of the Year title at the iGaming Idol Awards in Malta on November 30, 2023, has attained the license via White Star BV for its CasinoDays brand, marking a historical moment for the new regulatory regime in the Caribbean island.</p>
<p>The License Is a “Thrilling Endorsement” of Rhino’s Excellence</p>
<p>Rhino Entertainment has become the first operator to score a license following the grand opening of the CGCB application portal in September. Operators were allowed to register starting in November.</p>
<p>The certification also comes at a time when Curacao is busy bringing forward its new National Ordinance for Games of Chance (LOK) framework signaling a departure from the Master/Sub-License structure.</p>
<p>Rhino Entertainment Group’s chief executive officer, Ross Parkhill, spoke about the “privilege” of being the first gaming operator to obtain the direct license, calling it “a thrilling endorsement” of their commitment to responsible gambling and excellence.</p>
<p>He also expressed their full support for Curacao’s boosted regulatory processes while recognizing the “added value and prestige” it would bring to their license.</p>
<p>Finally, Parkhill said they were looking forward to “fostering an open and communicative relationship” with the CGCB while creating a bright and compliant future for the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>2024, a “Transformative” Period for Curacao</p>
<p>CGCB’s managing director, Cedric Pietersz, spoke about 2024 as a “transformative” time for Curacao while mentioning operators’ strong desire to secure new licenses, as noticed in the past three months since Curacao’s gaming industry supervisor started receiving applications.</p>
<p>Pietersz explained that White Star’s licensure “holds a special place” in both their hearts and history marking a crucial moment for the island’s growth into a premium gambling jurisdiction with many upcoming licenses on the horizon.</p>
<p>The CGCB also announced it had issued three digital seals for Geeka Corporation NV, Games &amp; More BV, and Small House BV. This would enable the recipients to showcase seals of approval from the regulator on their platforms once they would agree with the regulator’s terms.</p>
<p>In January, Curacao’s Independent Advisory Body raised a series of concerns regarding the text of the LOK and its compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s anti-money laundering requirements.</p>
