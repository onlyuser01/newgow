    <h1>Sweep Coin Casinos Windcreek Casino Atmore Casino World Login How Tall Is The Stratosphere Casino In</h1>

<p>My I.D. was verified sometime around 3 am on Feb. 10th and my withdraw request was denied shortly after. 2hrs later there was a "manager withdraw request" followed by an approval at which point my balance was erased. I cannot recall the exact tournament. It was a no cost entry tournament and I won $108.33 which was credited to my account. I played several hundred on various games then decided to withdraw as it was listed as "withdrawable" on my balance. I submitted the withdraw request for $175.00 along with my i.d.verification form. They sent verification of receiving the request and said it could take up to 5 days to verify. I checked back 2 days later and that's when I saw the manager withdraw in my transactions. Thats when i talked to a live support person, Kirsten. After holding for quite a while she finally said that I had played too many free spins/free chip games in a row which wasn't allowed so my winnings were forfeit. I explained i won money from a tournament and it was proceeds from those winnings i wanted to withdraw. I guess she didnt understand and replied saying if i won money in a tournament then if I was qualified the winnings would be credited to my account. I explained thats exactly what has happened and now I wanted to withdraw those winnings. She replied back once again that i had played too many free spin/ free chip games in a row which disqualifes my winnings therefore voided. Apparently I was qualified when they credited the winnings as she said, but not qualified if i want to cash out those winnings for some non-related non- believable reason. She then ended the chat. I opened another chat and Kirsten once again took the call. I asked if i could speak to a manager and she put me on hold for some time. Getting back to me she said a manager wasnt available so i asked for a managers email address. She just sent the link for support email and again ended the call.</p>
