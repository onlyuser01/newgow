<p>Harnessing Brazil’s impressive Formula 1 history and Brazilians’ burning passion for sports, Playmaker Capital Inc. will promote its brands at one of the highest-profile sporting events in the country, the São Paulo Grand Prix. The leading digital sports media company plans to get massive exposure for its soccer-based platform Bolavip and build momentum prior to the World Cup.</p>
<p>A Critical Market for Playmaker and its Soccer-Based Sites</p>
<p>The company will attend the three-day Formula 1 Heineken Grand Prix de São Paulo event at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace between November 11 and November 13. The Grand Prix is expected to repeat last year’s performance of bringing together a massive public of more than 180,000 people, following 2020’s canceled event due to social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>Playmaker plans to use the event to promote all of its brands, with special emphasis on the Bolavip website which has been ranked the leading sports platform in the county in February by Comscore Inc. Bolavip is a soccer-focused product available through several channels. Playmaker will also promote the rest of the brands it owns and operates at the Grand Prix, including SuperPoker, Antenados No Futebol, and Somos Fanáticos.</p>
<p>In the past few months, the company has kept a very close eye on the Latin American market in general and Brazil in particular, making the Brazilian market its primary focus of growth strategy. One of the main reasons is the upcoming legalization and regulation of the sports betting market in Brazil expected to occur by the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Brazil is the largest country in South America with a population of more than 210 million. The company that provides unique content via sports media portfolios and advanced technology brands is looking to gain its fair share of what is expected to grow into a highly profitable market in the region.</p>
<p>Starting with the summer of 2021, the company started making significant acquisitions in the LatAm region to help it solidify its presence here. The list includes the acquisition of Futmarketing in January 2022. Futmarketing is a leading Brazilian digital media and marketing company that helped Playmaker strengthen and diversify its portfolio in the country.</p>
<p>Playmaker Plans to Build Long-Term Relations with Formula 1 GP de São Paulo</p>
<p>As one of the leaders in the LatAm market, Playmaker plans on continuously growing the visibility and success of its brands in the region.</p>
<p>To do this, the company wishes to develop more long-lasting relationships with powerful partners recognized worldwide including the upcoming and much-anticipated Formula 1 Grand Prix de São Paulo. The event takes place over 71 laps measuring 4.309 kilometers (2.677 miles) at the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace and it will feature practice and qualifications on the first day, practice and sprint on the second day, and the big race on the third day.</p>
<p>Playmaker is responsible for creating a top-tier selection of sports media brands that provide sports fans with access to reputable sports betting platforms, major sports leagues, popular teams, and top advertising companies.</p>
