<p>The company is confident in its capability to create balanced value in the medium term while remaining socially responsible</p>
<p>La Française des Jeux, one of the biggest gambling and lottery companies in France, has published its results for FY 2022. The company’s metrics continued to improve across the board, leading to an enhanced FY 2023 guidance.</p>
<p>FDJ reported that its revenue rose by 9% in 2022 to $2.64 billion. The company successfully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and capitalized on major sporting events, such as the World Cup.</p>
<p>The operator experienced a growth of 11% in its lottery segment and a modest 1% growth across its sports betting and online gaming verticals. It now has around 5 million lottery players, which is twice as many as it did in 2019. Many of them also enjoy the company’s retail products, FDJ noted.</p>
<p>The company also reported a recurring EBITDA of $632 million, representing a 13% year-on-year increase and a margin of 24%. FDJ’s net profits for the period sat at $330 million.</p>
<p>In 2022, the French operator managed to sustain or create a total of 55,300 new jobs. It paid over a billion dollars to distributors and recorded $733 million of purchases in France. Its total economic and social contribution was estimated to be almost $7 billion to GDP.</p>
<p>In the wake of these thrilling results, the company updated its 2023 targets. FDJ now expects revenue growth of between 4 and 5 percent for the year.</p>
<p>2022 Was a Year of Great Significance for the Company</p>
<p>Stéphane Pallez, FDJ Group’s chair and chief executive officer addressed the strong results, praising the company’s business successes. She noted that the growth was felt across the company’s 30,000 points of sale in France, as well as across its digital segments.</p>
<p>Pallez said that the impressive performance will benefit both the company’s staff and its stakeholders. Furthermore, it will allow FDJ to strengthen its social commitments and continue its war on problem and underage gambling.</p>
<p>Pallez concluded that FDJ is confident in its strategy and ability to create balanced value in the medium term.</p>
<p>2022 was a year of important strategic significance for FDJ. In November, the company reached an agreement for the acquisition of ZEturf Group, a key racing business. A few months earlier, the company unveiled Nirio, a novel payments brand that will provide its clients with more flexibility. The company also managed to secure a notable three-year deal with the elite soccer team Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>2022 was also the year FDJ secured an A1+ rating from Moody’s ESG Solutions for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
