<p>The club is set to take “center stage” during the highly anticipated race</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International has teased more details about the experience Bellagio Fountain Club will offer during the F1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix. The club is set to take “center stage” during the highly anticipated race and will host a Winner’s Stage event.</p>
<p>Set to take place from November 16 to 18, the Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the most exciting events in this year’s motorsports calendar. As announced by MGM, the Bellagio Fountain Club will host a variety of events prior to, during and after the race.</p>
<p>Bellagio Fountain Club Will Bring Fans Closer to the Action</p>
<p>At the club, fans will be able to watch the race live. MGM will leverage “an unprecedented Dolby Vision viewing experience powered by LG OLED evo TVs” to “bring fans even closer to the track.” MGM said that action will come to life on screen with bright and vivid colors, cutting-edge detail and dazzling contrast. A total of eight screens will ensure that no guest misses a beat.</p>
<p>The Bellagio Fountain Club will also offer proximity to the track itself from an elevated location on the property’s signature lake. The club’s rooftop hospitality deck will allow guests to see the cars on the Las Vegas Boulevard live.</p>
<p>The club will also welcome entertainers from MGM Resorts’ entertainment portfolio and will also welcome some of the race’s best drivers for post-race commentary on Saturday night. This will notably include the top three drivers in the race who will share their reflections on the event with the community.</p>
<p>Leading Chefs and Will Cook Up Amazing Experiences</p>
<p>In addition, the venue will welcome renowned chefs such as the chef and humanitarian José Andrés, the famous award-winning chef Christina Tosi, the Michelin-decorated Alain Ducasse and Rainer Becker, founder of the famous izakaya-style Japanese restaurant ZUMA in London.</p>
<p>The aforementioned chefs will join a chef roster that also includes Mario Carbone, David Chang, Michael Mina, Masaharu Morimoto, Bryan &amp; Michael Voltaggio and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</p>
<p>This impressive chef lineup will provide motorsports fans unparaleled dining options. According to MGM, chefs will rotate throughout the three days of the F1 race, introducing new menus each day. In the meantime, a team of decorated mixologists and sommeliers will curate an open bar.</p>
<p>MGM Is Proud to Host the Winner’s Stage</p>
<p>Andrew Lanzino, MGM Resorts’ vice president of citywide events strategy, commented on the experiences awaiting motorsports fans at the club.</p>
<p>We’re curating an experience at the Bellagio Fountain Club that offers guests the absolute best of F1 – from incredible views of the race and exceptional cuisine and beverages, to an astonishing live Dolby Vision experience on LG OLED TVs, to getting up close with the winners post-race. Andrew Lanzino, VP of citywide events strategy, MGM Resorts International</p>
<p>Lanzino concluded that MGM is “incredibly honored” to host the Winner’s Stage of the F1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
