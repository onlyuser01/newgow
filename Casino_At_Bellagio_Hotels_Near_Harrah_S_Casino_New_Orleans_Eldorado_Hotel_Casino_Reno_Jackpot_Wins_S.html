    <h1>Casino At Bellagio Hotels Near Harrah S Casino New Orleans Eldorado Hotel Casino Reno Jackpot Wins S</h1>

<p>I specifically chose this casino because it was advertised as anonymous/no kyc. This was intentional on my part because I have had my identity stolen by casinos in the past. I am not willing to send sensitive personal information via email to gambling sites so I use crypto and patronize casinos that respect that.</p>
<p>well I played at mega dice - deposited about $200 in BTC. My first issue is that a bonus was automatically issued with the deposit even though I didn’t request one. So I had a very big play through requirement to get through of something like 40x.</p>
<p>I met the play through requirements and won a few times and requested withdrawals totaling about 4k.</p>
<p>i entered my bitcoin wallet and shortly after received an emails asking me for photos of my id, a bank statement or utility bill, photos of myself with these items, etc.</p>
<p>customer service pointed out to me that their terms say they can basically ask for this info if they feel like it. However, elsewhere all over review sites and the internet, this is advertised as an anonymous casino. What they are asking me for is not at all anonymous.</p>
<p>they are refusing to pay me unless I provide this info. I responded to their email letting them know I was not willing to share my private information and want a refund. As a result, they locked my account t and when I go to log in, it says it’s locked for "self exclusion" which is not accurate - I never told them to lock my account. This is also why I’m unable to share the exact dollar amounts above - I have no record of the transactions because they locked me out.</p>
<p>it’s a real shame to spend hours working through a huge play though requirement, winning a sizesab le amount, and then being denied the winnings and locked out.</p>
