    <h1>Instant Withdrawal Casino No Verification Deadwood South Dakota Casinos Aliante Casino Movies Casino</h1>

<p>BETER Live is giving a boost to FAVBET, a prominent sports betting and online casino brand, which will benefit from the supplier’s advanced online casino products. BETER Live will bring an array of excellent games developed by the studio to give a competitive edge to the partner brand.</p>
<p>Among the titles available are such choices as Gravity Blackjack, Gravity Roulette, Ukrainian Roulette, Blackjack, and Roulette. All of them have been created to cater to various audiences, with a strong focus on Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Previously, BETER Live and FAVBET worked on a dedicated Ukrainian Roulette table, which has already led to 40% higher conversion and a 4x gain in organic traffic, compared to regular roulette products.</p>
<p>BETER Live Director Anna Vikmane has welcomed the opportunity to see the company’s games rolled out with the operator and present audiences with innovative options to expand and play their favorite titles. Vikmane spoke about the importance of localization and the inherent benefits therein.</p>
<p>"Shortly after we launched our first games and FAVBET could see they were a big hit with its customers, we rolled out Ukrainian Roulette - the operator’s first step towards a dedicated offering for the market," she added.</p>
<p>BETER Live has been committed to building and developing outstanding live casino products, which started with a particular focus on regional and local markets at first. Yet, the company’s product variety has expanded well beyond that with the supplier now featuring more than 20 worthwhile games.</p>
<p>FAVBET in the meantime makes a perfect partner, as the operator was originally launched in Ukraine in 1999, and it has since expanded beyond that in Croatia, Romania, and Malta. It has more than 3 million registered users as well.</p>
<p>Apart from teaming up with individual companies, BETER Live has been working with aggregators, such as REEVO, to ensure that its products are available to various operators and accessible to all.</p>
<p>The studio has been committed to building a product portfolio that stands out by virtue of its advanced and innovative game mechanics. Now, FAVBET players get to benefit from these advanced titles as well.</p>
