<p>UFC Apex will host UFC Vegas 39 this Saturday, October 9 with the title fight between Mackenzie Dern and Marina Rodriguez bound to drive interest in the bout. Both fighters are looking to establish their name further in the strawweight division but only one will be able to walk away with a win to her name.</p>
<p>Dern is posted as a heavy favorite at (-155) but we should not rule out Rodriguez who is coming as the underdog in the bout with her (+135). The fight will be aired live on ESPN+ as per usual at 4 pm EST. You can look up the latest UFC Vegas 39 odds below.</p>

<p>Can Rodriguez Upset the Favorite?</p>
<p>The odds have Dern as the favorite for this bout and this is not exactly surprising. In the past three years, she has been on a tear. Her last recorded defeat was against Amanda Ribas back in 2019 but since then, Dern has been able to outlast every opponent or outright submit them.</p>
<p>Dern defeated Nina Nunes, Randa Markos, and Hannah Cifers, winning by submission, and went the distance against Virna Jandiroba in a three-round bout. Posting stellar results so far, her strength lies in her overall stamina and the ability to play fast and loose with her opponents.</p>
<p>She is a dangerous grappler who can bring down an opponent and force a submission out of them and she is flexible and quick enough to avoid injury by heavier hitters, which is precisely what she would need against Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Rodriguez has been more of a glass cannon fighter. She has the qualities to win but her overall record is not as good. She lost a fight by decision against Carla Esparza and posted a draw against Cynthia Calvillo before that.</p>
<p>Admittedly, she has bounced back since with a powerful TKO win against Amanda Ribas and a win by decision Michelle Waterson. Here is where it gets interesting. Rodriguez managed to beat Ribas who defeated Dern three years back.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot can change in the three years between these fights but it still goes to show that dismissing Rodriguez altogether, even if she’s posted as the longer odds, is not exactly in the best interest of betting fans.</p>
<p>Another issue with Dern’s fighting style and the overall shape is that even though she has gone the distance against some fighters, she has never had to fight in a five-round bout which will be the case on Saturday. Rodriguez certainly could.</p>
<p>We see Rodriguez as a worthwhile pick here at (+135)</p>
