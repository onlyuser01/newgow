<p>The Steelers Offense Isn’t Great in the Post-Big Ben Era</p>
<p>With 17.0 points scored per game on average, the Steelers are the 28th team in the league. Before the 37-30 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in the previous game week, their scoring average was even worse. In fact, they scored no more than 20 points in each of the other nine games they’ve played so far in 2022.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be so bad if their defense was playing as well as in previous years. However, in 2022, their defense ranks 26th, with 24.4 points conceded on average.</p>
<p>The Colts Tend to Do Well Against Teams Like Pittsburgh</p>
<p>Indianapolis is 4-6 on the season, with wins against the Chiefs, Broncos, Jaguars, and Raiders. As you can see, they tend to do well against those teams that are good in the offense, but whose defense isn’t too strong.</p>
<p>The Colts defense is 11th in the league with 20.0 points conceded on average. This is actually a great number considering how difficult their schedule has been so far in 2022. Their offense, however, hasn’t been that great. They are second worst with 15.7 PPG.</p>
<p>The reason behind this is that their quarterback Matt Ryan hasn’t been great passing-wise, which is why they’ve been relying on their running game. The trouble is that their best runner – running back Jonathan Taylor – has only recently started to shine.</p>
<p>He’s scored a rushing TD (as well as a receiving TD) in each of his previous two games. We expect him to continue his scoring spree, even though the Steelers are good in rushing defense.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs Indianapolis Colts Prediction</p>
<p>We think the Colts will win this. Taylor is going to shine once again, scoring a TD or two for the hosts. Their defense should have a good day as well, keeping the Steelers to just one or two TDs.</p>
<p>Picks: Indianapolis Colts to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
