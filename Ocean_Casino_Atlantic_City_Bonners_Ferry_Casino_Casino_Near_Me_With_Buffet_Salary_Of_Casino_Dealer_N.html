<p>The support for the global initiative complements the company's plans for responsible and sustainable growth on a global scale</p>
<p>The popular online sports betting and gaming group, MeridianBet Group, reaffirmed its commitment to sustainable growth and responsible business practices by joining a global initiative. The company confirmed Monday it joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative. The unique initiative, which thousands of companies have joined already, supports the voluntary development of a platform that seeks to ensure responsible business practices.</p>
<p>Meridian Gaming Group’s CEO, Zoran Milosevic, was excited about the new announcement saying that the company is thrilled to support the UN Global Compact. He stressed that this vital support reaffirms the company’s dedication to sustainable growth and responsible business practices.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join the UN Global Compact, as it reinforces Meridian Gaming Group’s dedication to responsible business practices and sustainable growth.“ Zoran Milosevic, CEO of Meridian Gaming Group</p>
<p>Milosevic acknowledged that this collaboration complements essential goals set by the company. Finally, he predicted that supporting the UN Global Compact will have a positive impact on the environment, as well as communities.</p>
<p>“This commitment is an essential step in our ongoing journey towards positively impacting our industry and creating added value to the communities and the environment,“ added Milosevic</p>
<p>Thousands of Companies Already Joined the Global Compact</p>
<p>The UN Global Compact was launched more than two decades ago, back in 2000. Since then, it has proven to be the largest global corporate sustainability initiative in the world after receiving support from more than 15,000 businesses from 160 countries. Additionally, the initiative is supported by more than 69 Local Networks and 3,800 non-business signatories.</p>
<p>Supporting the UN Global Compact initiative, MeridianBet joins thousands of companies from different sectors that vowed commitment to responsible business practices. Initiative supporters commit to ten universally accepted principles that involve labor, human rights, as well as environmental and anti-corruption efforts. The initiative itself provides broader support for global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, MeridianBet entered into an acquisition agreement with Golden Matrix. In a deal with a price tag of $300 million, payable in a combination of stock and cash, Golden Matrix agreed to acquire the company.</p>
<p>Thanks to the acquisition of MeridianBet and its related companies, Golden Matrix is expected to tap into new strategic gambling markets in Latin America, Africa, as well as Europe. The multi-million-dollar acquisition is expected to be closed at some point during the first half of this year, but a solid date hasn’t been confirmed at this point.</p>
