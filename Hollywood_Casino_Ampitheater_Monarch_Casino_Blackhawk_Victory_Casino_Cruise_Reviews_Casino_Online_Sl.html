    <h1>Hollywood Casino Ampitheater Monarch Casino Blackhawk Victory Casino Cruise Reviews Casino Online Sl</h1>

<p>First and last name, residential address, e-mail address, date of birth</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I can absolutely confirm that. At Queen Vegas, Swift and Slingo. Everywhere there one and the same data mentioned above. I signed up with Queen Vegas first, late March/possibly early April 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the summer, the operating company switched from Titanium Brace to Skill on Net. From then on everything became less attractive there, the bonuses, playing in general. I then closed the account at Queen Vegas sometime in the summer of 2021. When looking at the list, I notice that there is even one casino where I had an account and then had it closed. It's bacanaplay. The same login data there as well. Here you get another mail, Petronela.</p>
<p>ps. The Queen Vegas account appears to be completely and permanently closed. That's actually what I wanted for all accounts in this group. The bacanaplay account seems to be only temporarily blocked.</p>
<p>That's not what I want. What annoys me the most is that I can't even exclude myself from Slingo because the link doesn't work there. At the same time, my wish for a permanent account closure is not being fulfilled and it is being made as complicated as possible. The fact that I was able to register, deposit and play at several casinos in this group after closing the Queen Vegas account does not speak for a functioning player protection system in this group. An Aspire Group, for example, can do this better and their system automatically recognizes if you have been self-excluded from a casino in the group and prevents further accounts in casinos in their group.</p>
