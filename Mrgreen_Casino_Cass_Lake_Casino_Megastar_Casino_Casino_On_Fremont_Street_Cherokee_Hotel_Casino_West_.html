<p>Koi Gate review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a Japanese koi pond.</p>
<p>Players collect delicate waterlilies and ferocious dragons as wise-looking koi fish watch.</p>
<p>Set against rippling turquoise water, this game has a peaceful mood.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The gentle soundtrack has a traditional Japanese vibe filled with melodic flutes. It remains unobtrusive and players will likely be happy to leave it on for their gameplay.</p>
<p>The reels are framed by ornate Japanese lattices. This helps create the feeling that players are in an exquisitely kept garden.</p>
<p>Two hosting koi swim majestically on either side of the reels. Their bright orange colour contrasts with the azure water making the splash of their bodies more impressive.</p>
<p>Most symbols represent an aspect of nature, for example leaves, waves, waterlilies and bamboo. The dragon and koi symbols stand out as regal and especially well-designed.</p>
<p>Wild wins prompt the duel animation of a swimming koi and a flying dragon. This gives a mythical vibe to the reels.</p>
<p>When players begin the Re-Spins feature, the backdrop goes through a trippy transformation to become a dragon-filled sky. This furthers the feeling that there are some magical mysteries to the idyllic setting.</p>
<p>Koi Wild symbol expands before wins are calculated</p>
<p>Koi Gate Gameplay</p>
<p>Koi Gate is a five reel, three row slot, with 18 win lines.</p>
<p>Win lines pay in both directions starting from either reel 1 or 5. Players winning with five symbols on one winline are paid for the line both from right to left and left to right (effectively doubling their win).</p>
<p>Players have the option to hit stop on the spinning reel to speed up gameplay.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins in Koi Gate</p>
<p>This slot has two Wild symbols (the Koi symbol and the dragon symbol). Each one substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>The Koi symbol appears only on reels 2, 3, and 4. When any Koi symbol is part of a winning combination, it expands into the dragon symbol to cover all positions before the winnings are awarded.</p>
<p>Players are awarded Re-Spins when one or more Koi symbols appear. Players win additional Re-Spins when one or more Koi symbols appear on screen while in the Re-Spins round.</p>
<p>There is no cap on Re-Spins and they continue to be awarded until a spin occurs in which no Koi symbol lands.</p>
<p>Players’ prizes are doubled while in the Re-Spins feature, and Re-Spins will be played according to the lines and bet of the game that triggered the feature.</p>
<p>The Progressive Jackpot Feature means that players may win the Progressive Jackpot at the end of any game round. This win is added to the players’ other wins.</p>
<p>Koi Gate Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.6%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.18 up to a maximum of $/£/€900 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility Koi-themed slot.</p>
<p>This game makes up for its less desirable volatility by being a really pleasant place to hang out.</p>
<p>The animation and music work together to make the atmosphere feel mesmeric and fun.</p>
<p>Players looking for a lot of rough-and-tumble action may wish to look elsewhere, but for those looking for a dreamy escape, this game is just the ticket.</p>
