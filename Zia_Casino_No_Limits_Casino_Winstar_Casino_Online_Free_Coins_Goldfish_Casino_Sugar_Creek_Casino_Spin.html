<p>Our Audit team found bet/s of EUR 3 while the bonus was active which clearly breach our Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions.I placed withdrawal order for an amount in total 9 500 EUR. Today I received a message:</p>
<p>Please be advised that during the verification of your withdrawal, they have noticed that our Bonus Terms and Conditions were breached.</p>
<p>Please be reminded that:</p>
<p>"12. Players are allowed to place single bets lower than 20% of the total value of the Active Bonus credited and should not exceed 8 EUR, 8 USD, 8 AUD, 8 CAD, 80 SEK, 80 NOK (as applicable). Therefore, placing a bet of 8 EUR while there's an Active Bonus of 100 EUR in effect is considered acceptable practice.

<p>Upon checking, on the 11th of July, while having EUR 2,320.04 in cash balance, you have claimed a free bonus of EUR 1.56, therefore the maximum bet allowed should be less than EUR 0.31., while having EUR 2,320.04. in cash balance, you have claimed a free bonus of EUR 1.56, therefore the maximum bet allowed should be less than EUR 0.31.</p>
<p>Our Audit team found bet/s of EUR 3 while the bonus was active which clearly breach our Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
<p>All your winnings from the breach have been voided accordingly and EUR 2,500 has been returned to your balance which you can withdraw anytime."</p>
<p>I deposited my own funds in amount of 5000 EUR and wanted to return it by winnings. And when I try to withdraw 9500 EUR, they are referring to insignificant breach in order to decline refund and offer me only 2500 EUR which is not enough. In my opinion the breach was in-proportionate to the amount which I was going to withdraw and return my deposited money. It seems the casino is looking for every opportunity to decline any withdrawal.</p>
<p>Considering that they have placed 2500 EUR in my account instead of 9500 EUR which I honestly in good faith won, I claim for the residing 7000 EUR to be refunded.</p>
<p>If this is not possible, I claim for refund of all my deposited money amounting to 5000 EUR.</p>
