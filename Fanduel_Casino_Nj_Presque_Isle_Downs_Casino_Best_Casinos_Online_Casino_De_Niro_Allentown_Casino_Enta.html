<p>New data released by the company shows an increase in the interest in bets on Women's World Cup and an uptick in the bets placed by women</p>
<p>Ahead of the wrap-up of the biggest women’s sporting event in the world this weekend, the global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment group, Entain, released new data, highlighting growth in the number of bets by women for the Women’s World Cup. In its recent report, the company revealed key details regarding the performance and interest in the event from different markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Starting with Entain’s UK sportsbook, the company reported an uptick in the number of women betting on women’s professional sports games. Data by Ladbrokes and Coral reveals that England’s first three games attracted significant interest in women, considering they placed 21% of the bets. This result, marked an uptick when compared to the 17% of bets placed by women from the Women’s Euro in 2022 and the 13% of wagers from the World Cup in 2019.</p>
<p>Notably, an increase was observed in the United States as well. The strong performance of the US women’s team undoubtedly helped propel the popularity of betting, resulting in an increase in the wagers for women’s soccer. Judging by Entain’s recent report, the game between the US women’s team against Vietnam resulted in an uptick in BetMGM’s wagers three times when compared to Lionel Messi’s debut with Inter Miami CF.</p>
<p>Similarly strong engagement and retention were observed in New Zealand as well. Entain’s partner in the country, TAB New Zealand, posted a 365% increase in the number of bets placed on the Women’s World Cup. In neighboring Australia, the number of wagers increased by nearly 200% as well. According to TAB New Zealand, some 15% of the wagers on this year’s Women’s World Cup were placed by women. This result marked another increase, compared to the 9% figure recorded in 2019.</p>
<p>The Popularity of Women’s Sports Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Dominic Grounsell, Entain’s chief commercial officer, was excited about the new results. He said that the figures reveal a significant increase in interest in the Women’s World Cup, confirming that there is a growing audience for women’s sports. “More of our customers are finding new ways to support their favorite teams – and that’s with a bet,” added Grounsell.</p>
<p>“As this Women’s World Cup is proving, the interest from fans is there, which paves the way for women’s sport to gain bigger audiences, more media attention, and more avenues for aspiring female athletes around the world to take up sports professionally.“ Dominic Grounsell, chief commercial officer at Entain</p>
<p>Besides the latest results, a recent study, co-funded by Entain and conducted by IBIA, revealed that soccer continues to attract more bettors and this applies to women’s sports as well. Judging by the study, the number of bets on women’s football has grown by approximately 20% since 2020.</p>
