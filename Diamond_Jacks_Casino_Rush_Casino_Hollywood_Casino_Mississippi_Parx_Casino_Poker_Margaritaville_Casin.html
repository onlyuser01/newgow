<p>Leading iGaming software provider EveryMatrix announced that its sports betting solution, OddsMatrix, has just surpassed €1 billion in turnover. The milestone was reached on September 9 this year.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Had a Turnover of More than €1B in September</p>
<p>EveryMatrix pointed out that last year, OddsMatrix’s annual turnover sat at a little bit under €1 billion. The company noted that surpassing a billion in just three quarters of 2022 is a huge achievement that attests to the company’s growth. The supplier added that August and September’s turnover was 100% higher year-on-year.</p>
<p>The achievement is in line with OddsMatrix’s previous record. At the beginning of 2022, the sports betting brand announced that it had recorded a monthly turnover of over €100 million in the last quarter of 2021. The company is optimistic that it might hit a monthly turnover of over €200 million in Q4 2022.</p>
<p>The OddsMatrix solution is an all-encompassing tool that provides operators with everything they need to enhance their sports betting businesses and grow their revenues. The solution is fully customizable and comes equipped with supreme quality monitoring tools that sportsbooks can use to boost their customers’ engagement and enhance their offerings.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s CEO Praised the Results</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix’s group chief executive officer, said that he was very excited to see OddsMatrix surpass €1 billion in September. He called the milestone “another stunning accomplishment” for the company as a whole and said that he is very optimistic about EveryMatrix’s growth.</p>
<p>Groes expects OddsMatrix to reach a turnover of €200 million a month in Q4 2022. He added that this growth can easily translate into more investments.</p>
<p>We’ll likely be hitting EUR 200m turnover per month in Q4 2022. And the fast growth of volumes can be turned into even more feature investment, positively reinforcing the volume growth! Ebbe Groes, CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>This year has been a great one for OddsMatrix so far. Not only did EveryMatrix’s brand surpass a major milestone, but it also managed to score some impressive partnership agreements with numerous sports betting brands across the world. For example, EveryMatrix inked a key deal with Intralot in Morocco, agreeing to leverage OddsMatrix to power La Marocaine des Jeux &amp; des Sports en Ligne’s offering with a new iGaming and betting site.</p>
<p>Earlier EveryMatrix agreed to supply the German brand bet-at-home with its comprehensive turnkey solution, thus replacing the operator’s existing platform.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, EveryMatrix posted its Q2 2022 financial results, highlighting the company’s tremendous growth.</p>
