<p>We are down to the last race in the NASCAR Cup Series this July, with the Foxwoods Resorts Casino reuniting the motorsports’ best racers looking to secure a win. Here are the odds.</p>
<p>2021 Foxwoods Resort Casino 301 – Odds and Race Overview</p>
<p>The NASCAR Cup Series is back with another installment, and the New Hampshire Speedway is hosting the 2021 Foxwoods Resorts Casino 301. This is the last race to be held in the month of July, with only four more events left on the circuit, which will be taking place throughout August.</p>
<p>This means that there is fairly little time for drivers looking to secure the title in the NASCAR Cup Series to improve on their results. The current leaders seem to be Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson with 836 and 826 points, respectively.</p>
<p>A win at the New Hampshire Speedway this Sunday would mean another 40 points for the victor. This begs the question – has Larson any chance of closing in on Hamlin, and should we be looking for someone from the fringes making a claim on the title?</p>
<p>Odds to Win 2021 Foxwoods Resorts Casino 301</p>
<p>Drivers Odds Kyle Larson +500 Martin Truex Jr. +500 Denny Hamlin +550 Kyle Busch +600 Brad Keselowski +750 Chase Elliott +800 Joey Logano +1200 Kevin Harvick +1200 Alex Bowman +1400 William Byron +1600 *Odds at BetOnline</p>
<p>So, what story are the odds telling right now? With Hamlin and Larson in the lead of the overall standing, they are given a very strong chance of succeeding in the upcoming race. Yet, the odds can’t really help us immediately pick a winner.</p>
<p>The Foxwoods Resorts Casino 301 is very much going to be a neck-and-neck race between Truex Jr., Hamlin, Busch, and, naturally, Larson. Larson will want to secure a win to displace Hamlin in the temporary standings before heading out for the next month’s series of competitions.</p>
<p>Yet, Truex Jr. and Busch are not going to give up without putting up a fight. Betting on Hamlin to win will be a bit of a stretch since the driver is winless this entire season, but this hasn’t stopped him from accumulating the most points on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>However, Hamlin has won three times before at New Hampshire, and this does give him at least a slight edge. While we don’t expect to see Hamlin cross the finishing line first, he will certainly gun for the first place.</p>

<p>Drivers to Look Out For in Upcoming Foxwoods Resorts Casino 301</p>
<p>We have witnessed a lot of driving these past few weeks. Truex Jr. managed to secure the third spot at Atlanta just a week ago, and he has been finishing seventh or better in six consecutive races, making him a fair contender. The odds at BetOnline actually put him neck-and-neck with Hamlin for the first spot, but sportsbooks are still hesitant, and most side with Truex Jr. as the runner-up.</p>
<p>Then you have Brad Keselowski, who emerged victorious during last August’s New Hampshire. He has only won once in the past ten races, though, so it’s not like Keselowski is in his best form just yet.</p>
<p>As to Kevin Harvick, the driver has managed to win four times at New Hampshire, which naturally gives him the best historic chance of winning again. He has only done worse than the fifth spot in the past five years as well, so he is definitely a fair contender.</p>
