<p>Dear fairy98tole,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. I checked the casino's Bonus Terms and Conditions and found the following rules:</p>
<p>Article 2.3</p>
<p>"Irregular play" includes, but is not limited to, any one of the following types of play:</p>
<p>● Placing single bets in excess of 10% of the value of the bonus credited to your account until such time as the wagering requirements for that bonus have been met unless otherwise stated. For example, if you received a bonus of 20.000uBTC, then the maximum bet that can be placed is 2000 uBTC The 10% rule does not apply if the bet size is less than 200uBTC</p>
<p>Article 2.4</p>
<p>"Promotional abuse includes, but is not limited to, any one of the following types of play:</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>● Playing with a bet of more than 5$ or equivalent amount is considered opportunistic betting with an active deposit bonus and we reserve the right to cancel any such winnings.</p>
<p>Our position is closely explained in Fair Gambling Codex. The max bet rule is, in fact, an industry standard, just as the fact that a casino has the right to seize the player's winnings from bonus play after breaking this rule. We prefer not to go against industry standards by penalizing casinos that use the maximum bet rule against players from time to time.</p>
<p>However, if you feel like you have been accused mistakenly, feel free to forward me your game history together with a link to the specific bonus that you redeemed and played. My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>If there is any other relevant communication between you and the casino, please send it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
