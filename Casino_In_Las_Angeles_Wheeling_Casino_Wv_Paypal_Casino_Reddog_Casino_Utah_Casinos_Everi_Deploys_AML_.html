<p>The company agreed to supply its fourth-generation anti-money laundering solution, Entegrity, powering the operations of the casino and entertainment venue in Minnesota</p>
<p>The global provider of products, content, financial technology and player loyalty solutions, powering digital and land-based gambling operators, Everi, announced a new partnership, allowing it to further expand its footprint in the United States. On Monday, the company revealed that it joined forces with Prairie’s Edge Casino Resort in Granite Falls, Minnesota. Under the terms of the new collaboration, the company agreed to power the venue with its fourth-generation anti-money laundering (AML) solution, Entegrity.</p>
<p>Renowned as a leading AML solution, Entegrity strengthens the compliance of operators within the gambling sector. It offers new web-based advanced capabilities that cater to operators in the sector, delivering efficiencies and improving user experience. Operators that use Everi’s solutions benefit from a wide range of modules that boost their compliance with AML regulations.</p>
<p>The automated solution helps collect transactional and patron data, granting gambling operators easy access to such insights. Entegrity offers modules such as Subject Manager that features a comprehensive view of a patron’s activities, including a source of funds, due diligence and enhanced due diligence, among others. Moreover, operators that use Everi’s fourth-generation AML solution can benefit from Incident Manager, a module that provides efficiency for the management of suspicious activities and incident reporting.</p>
<p>Recently, Everi confirmed that its financial technology subsidiary, Everi Payments, won in a lawsuit in the United States. The legal triumph dating to September comes after a patent lawsuit was filed by Sightline Payments LLC against Everi Payments.</p>
