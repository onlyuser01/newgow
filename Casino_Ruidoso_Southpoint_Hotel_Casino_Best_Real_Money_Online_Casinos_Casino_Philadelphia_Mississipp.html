<p>A 44-year-old man is behind bars in Las Vegas, accusing of sexually assaulting a juvenile female 25 years ago at a hotel-casino in Laughlin, Nevada.</p>

<p>Enoch Jeremy Spina was booked Sunday into the Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas. He is scheduled for a court date Tuesday on one count of sexual assault, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Police said a juvenile female in late May 1995 reported being sexually assaulted at Harrah’s Laughlin Hotel and Casino. Laughlin is about an hour and a half south of Las Vegas on the Arizona border.</p>
<p>At the time, the female juvenile reported drinking at a high school graduation party in a room at the resort, police said. She passed out in the room. She later was moved to a different room where Spina was staying at the resort, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Hours later she awoke and determined, based on evidence in the room, that she had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Facebook Friend Request</p>
<p>According to a DNA analysis in 1995, Spina could not eliminated. However he was not arrested, the Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>Another analysis in 2019 indicated the DNA from the incident was a match to Spina’s, according to the newspaper. A cold case detective with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department got in touch with the woman who had been assaulted in 1995 to see if she wanted to pursue a case against this suspect. She said she wanted him prosecuted, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>During the investigation, police learned Spina had sent the woman a Facebook friend request on Christmas Day in 2010. The woman’s mother sent a response, police said.</p>
<p>Why would you contact my daughter after what you did to her?” the mother asked.</p>
<p>According to authorities, Spina replied, “First of all I don’t know her side, obviously, and second, I just wanted to apologize for what she felt was wrong that happened. I’m sure we both made mistakes that night and I honestly wanted to offer my sincirest (sic) apologies to her and hope that she can possibly forgive me one day as well.”</p>
<p>Laughlin Murder</p>
<p>Laughlin recently was in the news when the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty for an Arizona man found guilty of murdering a friend over a gambling debt. The 1994 incident began when the now-convicted killer traveled to Laughlin to gamble with his girlfriend and another man.</p>
<p>In another killing over a gambling debt, a 70-year-old man was sentenced in Wisconsin to life in prison this month for stabbing an 88-year-old man to death over a $100 gambling debt.</p>
