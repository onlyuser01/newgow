<p>Nikola Jokic‚Äôs Teammates Need to Step Up ASAP</p>
<p>The Denver Nuggets lost to the Miami Heat in the second game of the 2023 NBA Finals. The final score was 111-108 for the visitors, even though the hosts had a 15-point advantage in the first half.</p>

<p>Denver‚Äôs best player Nikola Jokic had a great game, scoring 41 points that day. However, his teammates weren‚Äôt as great. In fact, all of them scored under 20 points. Jamal Murray had an okay game though. He scored just 18 points, but we saw him make 10 assists.</p>
<p>All the others, however, were very disappointing, both offensively and defensively. If they want to take the lead in the series once again, they will have to do much, much better on Wednesday. The bad news is that the Miami Heat are fired up ahead of Game 3.</p>
<p>The Heat Looking for Their First Home Win Over the Nuggets Since 2018</p>
<p>The Miami Heat have a relatively bad record in home games against the Denver Nuggets, having lost each of their last four NBA games at Kaseya Center. The last time they beat the Nuggets at home was in March 2018, and they did it after overtime.</p>
<p>Another thing that needs to worry them is that they lost their last two home games (vs. Boston Celtics). However, the atmosphere in the Heat locker room is great right now, which could play an important role in Game 3.</p>
<p>These guys did great in the previous game, playing like a true collective. Pretty much all of the Heat players did great on Sunday, with Gabe Vincent leading the way scoring-wise with 23 points. Still, it was Bam Adebayo who absolutely destroyed the Nuggets. He scored 21 points, while also making nine defensive rebounds.</p>
<p>Speaking of rebounds, Kevin Love was the one who recorded 10 rebounds (3 offensive and 7 defensive rebounds). Jimmy Butler too had a fine game, recording 21 points, along with nine assists.</p>
<p>Denver Nuggets vs Miami Heat Game 3 Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction for Game 3 of the 2023 NBA Finals is that this is going to be one very close battle. The Denver Nuggets are favored for a reason, but we don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to have an easy job. We think there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre going to cover the spread. At least not in the regular time ‚Äì we think there‚Äôs a very good chance this game will go to overtime.</p>
<p>Pick: Miami Heat +2.5</p>
