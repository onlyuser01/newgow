<p>The global digital sports platform, Fanatics Holdings, announced that its subsidiary, Fanatics Betting and Gaming, rolled out its sportsbook for the regulated gambling market in West Virginia. Announced Thursday, the launch promises the most rewarding online sportsbook in the state, offering supreme entertainment and experiences. Thanks to the launch, Fanatics Sportsbook is now available for visitors and residents in West Virginia with Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>The launch of the new sportsbook comes after earlier this year, Fanatics Betting and Gaming confirmed the acquisition of the US assets of PointsBet. Announced back in August, the acquisition helped strengthen the operator’s footprint in the country. At the time, Fanatics confirmed its plans to migrate PointsBet’s customers to its new Fanatics Sportsbook mobile app.</p>
<p>As a result of the new launch, West Virginia customers who previously had an account with PointsBet can now use the same credentials to access the Fanatics Sportsbook. Such customers can use their username, password and account balance, as well as settings related to responsible gambling and rewards points when accessing Fanatics’ betting app.</p>
<p>The launch of Fanatics Sportsbook comes after recently, the company inked a partnership with Paysafe, the leading payments specialist. Announced earlier this week, the collaboration saw Fanatics tap into the company’s traditional card payments and alternative payment methods.</p>
<p>The New Sportsbook Offers a Plethora of Features</p>
<p>As the newest sportsbook in West Virginia, Fanatics’ mobile betting app offers exciting new features. Sports fans and bettors alike can benefit from the sportsbook’s technology that was built natively on Android and iOS, ensuring supreme experiences thanks to quality services, high speed and intuitive design.</p>
<p>Fanatics Sportsbook also claims it is the most rewarding mobile app in the state with its FanCash – The Currency of Sport, an engaging loyalty program that allows dollar-for-dollar conversions as well as access to sports merchandise. Additionally, the mobile app grants customers a chance to earn 5% FanCash on same game parlay bets, 3% on parlay bets, as well as 1% on straight bets and odds boosts.</p>
<p>Sports bettors that use Fanatics Sportsbook can also access an industry-leading search that offers search history, searching via alias/synonyms for events, markets and leagues. Powered by Genius Sports Limited, the sportsbook is one of the first that offers live streaming with BetVision. Thanks to the live streaming functionality, the sportsbook enables customers to access live streaming and place wagers via the same app.</p>
<p>Another feature that underlines the quality of Fanatics’ sports betting app is its personalization. The sportsbook features trending bets, special promotions and rewards that fit the profile of each individual bettor.</p>
