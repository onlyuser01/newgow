    <h1>Joe Pesci Casino Wind Creek Casino Rv Park Seminole Casino Immokalee Florida Casinos In Montreal Que</h1>

<p>Dan Broda, Checkd Group’s Senior Product Manager, describes how app-based solutions have the</p>
<p>potential to play a major role in driving traffic to operators.</p>
<p>The opportunity for affiliates in the United States as sports betting continues to roll out is huge.</p>
<p>Two years ago, with sports betting in its infancy, DraftKings reported that the lifetime value of US</p>
<p>sports bettors was around $2,500 per customer. Since then, we have seen enormous sign-up</p>
<p>bonuses of thousands of dollars offered to players and talk of the large customer acquisition cost in</p>
<p>certain states as the biggest operators scramble for market share, against an evolving background</p>
<p>where a focus on responsible gambling is rightly starting to take hold.</p>
<p>Even as the waters calm, the potential size of the overall sports betting market remains substantial</p>
<p>and as an affiliate, we can play a major role in directing high-quality traffic to major operators in the</p>
<p>the shape of engaged would-be bettors.</p>
<p>We have seen in the UK how technology has helped to guide and smooth the user journey of</p>
<p>bettors. In providing native applications for sports bettors, affiliates can create tools and solutions</p>
<p>that empower the bettor to make evidence-based betting decisions that are based on key</p>
<p>statistics, while also incorporating a social element of being able to view popular selections that are</p>
<p>being made within the app.</p>
<p>This approach is geared toward providing users with helpful stats and tips that they can use to inform</p>
<p>betting decisions, enabling them to then place their bets – often completed within the app – and to</p>
<p>track their progress.</p>
<p>We believe this proven approach can also bear fruit in the US. At Checkd Group, we have an</p>
<p>the equivalent of our SmartAcca tool – an in-app solution that provides users with parlay selections</p>
<p>based on historical statistics – in development already, having placed a foothold in the market</p>
<p>through the establishment of our tipping site FlashPicks. If you can put eye-catching statistics in front</p>
<p>of people and, more importantly, link them to betting opportunities, this can act as a key to</p>
<p>unlocking the power of the casual bettor.</p>
<p>Differences</p>
<p>While we believe that technological solutions that have proven successful in the UK can be</p>
<p>transferred successfully to the US, it is also vital to understand the major differences that exist</p>
<p>between these markets. Having conducted extensive research prior to the launch of FlashPicks, we</p>
<p>found that micro-influencers have big audiences that they have established through social channels.</p>
<p>In the US, the power of personality exerts a strong influence and there is an added element of</p>
<p>authenticity involved whereby every bet is tracked along with the overall ROI. This focus on the</p>
<p>views and insights provided by individual tipsters is a major consideration when creating a Betting</p>
<p>Hub-style app for the US market.</p>
<p>The technology of deep linking from an affiliate to a specific selection for an operator does exist but</p>
<p>only with certain bookmakers. Also, with the focus very much being acquisition rather than loyalty at</p>
<p>this stage, the end-to-end user journey of choosing selections and placing a bet via an affiliate is still</p>
<p>in its infancy and will definitely evolve as the market matures.</p>
<p>These are still early days and affiliates entering the market are getting to grips with how to engage</p>
<p>with US audiences. In order for the affiliate-operator partnership to truly flourish there needs to be a</p>
<p>drive towards educating users. To that end, FlashPicks currently carries over a dozen betting guides, along with state-specific pages so the user is aware of the legality of that region and which operators</p>
<p>are licensed.</p>
<p>Loyal</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a loyal audience, just as we have achieved in the UK, and to build products that</p>
<p>are useful and compelling. FlashPicks has been in a stage of continual development since launching</p>
<p>earlier this year and the next stage is to release a native app onto the market that is fully tailored to</p>
<p>the US.</p>
<p>In the longer term, we see our growth journey following similar lines to the UK by creating products</p>
<p>for media partners of the kind that we delivered for Checkd Media and talkSPORT. We will also look</p>
<p>to again provide tech solutions to operators, as we did with SmartAcca and William Hill and Sky Bet.</p>
<p>US operators have spent huge amounts on top-line marketing efforts to stimulate sign-ups, but by</p>
<p>harnessing tech solutions to provide insight and smooth the user journey, as an affiliate we can</p>
<p>help deliver bettors who want to back their favourite tipsters or their own judgement. In cultivating</p>
<p>a loyal audience that is receptive to evidence-based betting selections, we believe we can have a big</p>
<p>say in shaping the future of high-margin, revenue-driving casual betting.</p>
