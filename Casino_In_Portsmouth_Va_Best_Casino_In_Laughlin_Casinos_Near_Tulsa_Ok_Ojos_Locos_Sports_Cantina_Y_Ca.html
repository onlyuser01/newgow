<p>The Lone Star State has folded its cards on sports betting for the 2023 legislative session, but the state governor is upbeat about the industry’s long-term prospects</p>
<p>Despite the setback, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is confident that the State Senate can be swayed to see reason and support a sports betting legalization. Perry, who is also a spokesperson for the Texas Sports Betting Alliance, is a passionate advocate for the issue and has echoed the calls of other prominent figures in the state to push forward with the legalization of sports gambling.</p>
<p>Better Times Coming for Texas Sports Betting, Nevermind Defeat</p>
<p>There are various reasons why this should be the case, including making sure that Texas becomes a casino resort destination where travelers plan to go instead of having locals save up for trips to other places instead. Sports betting legislation was going strong this year with the Texas State House voting in favor of it with a 101-42 super majority.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Senate proved too hard a nut to crack. However, Gov. Perry is confident that this is a temporary setback as the will of the people is what matters and he is confident that Texans do want to bet in a safe and legal environment, which is precisely what Perry will be working on next.</p>
<p>“We listened to the people and put forth legislation that would combat the $6 billion illegal market with commonsense regulation and protect Texans without growing the size and scope of government,” he added.</p>
<p>Of course, not all arguments Gov. Perry makes are actually tenable. For one, there has been a bit of fear-mongering as to how much Texans spend on black market operations.</p>
<p>The main hurdle for the state now remains the fact that Texas would need to call a referendum and amend the constitution to allow for the expansion of gambling which requires two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House.</p>
<p>Gov. Perry seems fairly confident that the matter can be put up for a vote in the upcoming 2025 ballot. There are no guarantees that this would happen, though, but there is a growing momentum for sports gambling that is seeing people interested in betting with Texans now forced to drive out of state or turn to black markets.</p>
