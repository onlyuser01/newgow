    <h1>Saint Joseph Frontier Casino Greektown Casino Ocean Casino Nj Tuscany Suites And Casino Treasure Isl</h1>

<p>Design Works Gaming (DWG), a fast-expanding supplier and developer of iGaming content in the United States, has made another important stride towards consolidating its presence in the regulated online casino market across the country.</p>
<p>This time around, the company has launched its cutting-edge technology and casino products with DraftKings in Connecticut, adding to the prominent gaming operator’s library of impressive games. This marks the fourth state in which DWG has introduced its offer, delivering a range of experiences that resonate with iGaming crowds.</p>
<p>DWG has been a leader in bringing innovative and trend-bucking content that has allowed it to differentiate its offer and sign partnerships with some of the biggest operators in the regulated market so far. The company is similarly committed to continue providing players and operators with a strong gaming portfolio everywhere it goes.</p>
<p>In Connecticut specifically, DraftKings players will have access to some of DWG’s most signature games and features, including the LuckyTap series, 10X Fortune, Break the Bounty Lucy Tap, and more. The games have been already introduced with the help of the OpenGaming platform, owned by Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity for his company, DWG CEO and Founder Troy Zurawski said that he was excited to have this opportunity to expand the company’s reach in the United States, and remained upbeat about what DWG brought to the table:</p>
<p>"Our team knows how to navigate the regulatory landscape, understands local preferences, and tailors our games to meet the specific needs of Connecticut players."</p>
<p>This new collaboration with DraftKings will be as impactful as the company can hope it to be, Zurawski assured, arguing that DWG has already launched successfully in a number of other prominent jurisdictions, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.</p>
<p>DWG is in a prime position in the United States as well. The company has repeatedly appeared on the Eilers-Fantini Online Game Performance Report, a survey of the most successful slot games across five regulated online casino states, which has seen the LuckyTap and other DWG titles frequently top the list or appear in the first 10 spots.</p>
