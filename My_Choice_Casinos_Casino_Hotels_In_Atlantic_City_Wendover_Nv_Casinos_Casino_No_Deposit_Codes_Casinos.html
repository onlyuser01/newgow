    <h1>My Choice Casinos Casino Hotels In Atlantic City Wendover Nv Casinos Casino No Deposit Codes Casinos</h1>

<p>BGaming has partnered with IZZI Casino to create Izzi Art, a branded slot with random multipliers up to x100, a max multiplier of x10,200, and Bonanza mechanics mixed with Free Spins</p>
<p>The creative, fast-growing 2012-launched iGaming content provider with a portfolio of over 100 games, BGaming, has teamed up with Izzi Casino, an online gambling platform launched by Games Entertainment Limited in 2021, for the launch of Izzi Art, a unique branded slot.</p>
<p>Together with the online casino that has already managed to create some noise in the industry, BGaming gave the world’s most celebrated works of art a mouth-dropping makeover by cleverly mixing classic elegance with boldness and the unique charm of contemporary internet culture.</p>

<p>High Release date: September 7, 2023</p>
<p>When the Line Between Artistry and Gaming Blurs</p>
<p>BGaming, which is currently getting ready to attend the iGaming G2E Las Vegas 2023 between October 9-12, warmly invites players to explore the lovely fresh release where the most celebrated works of art on the planet received a rebellious makeover.</p>
<p>After entering the unique modern art museum with its bold visuals, players will notice the 6×5 grid that mixes Bonanza mechanics with Free Spins rounds packed with humorous animations, including imagery of a sneezing face mask-clad Mona Lisa or Michelangelo’s David wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p>According to BGaming’s product manager brand exclusives, Nikita Zavadsky, the new daring slot features an unforgettable soundtrack and artwork, being an “eclectic, thought-provoking” release that has been made possible with the help of their highly creative and customizable offerings. Zavadsky further added that the new game is “unlike anything” that they produced in the past thanks to the collaboration with their valued partner.</p>
<p>Izzi Casino used the voice of a spokesperson to praise BGaming’s ability to “execute a game concept” by making continuous changes to the slot to make it perfectly match their requirements while also bringing their own creativity to the table for a perfect result. The same representative expressed their thrill for the collaboration while expressing their eagerness to expand their “list of joint exclusives in the future.”</p>
<p>Special Slot Features</p>
<p>The game also has special features like Chance x2, Buy Bonus, and Refilling features. For example, during the Refilling feature, a player may come across numerous consecutive wins on each new spin by paying out all matching combinations and eliminating all winning symbols after a spin. The empty cells are then filled with endless symbols dropping from above until no additional winning combinations show up.</p>
<p>Hitting anywhere between four and six golden-haired Medusa scatters on any location on the grid will trigger the Free Spins feature that will pay 10, 20, or 30 free spins. Players who are lucky enough to hit more than three scatters while the Free Spins feature is engaged receive five extra free spins.</p>
<p>During the same Free Spins round, hitting a random Multiplier symbol from x2 to x100 will considerably boost the game’s winning potential. The multipliers will remain in their positions until the end of the refilling sequence. Finally, their values will be summarized in order to multiply the total win.</p>
<p>Players eager to jump straight into the action are given the option of purchasing the Chance x2 feature during the main game. By doing so, gamers slightly grow their bets while enjoying more chances of hitting free spins.</p>
<p>It is also possible to engage the Free Spins round via the available Buy Bonus feature for a price that is automatically adjusted whenever the player changes the bet. This feature is not active when the Chance x2 feature is triggered.</p>
<p>Last month, BGaming announced a new partnership agreement with NetBet that would help the latter expand its selection of games. Previously, the provider announced the launch of Luck&amp;Magic, a fresh slot with bonus games.</p>
