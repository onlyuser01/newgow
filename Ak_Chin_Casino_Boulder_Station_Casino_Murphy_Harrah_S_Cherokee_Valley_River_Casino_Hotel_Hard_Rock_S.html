    <h1>Ak Chin Casino Boulder Station Casino Murphy Harrah S Cherokee Valley River Casino Hotel Hard Rock S</h1>

<p>PGA West’s Stadium Course is where Round 4 of The American Express will take place starting Friday, January 28. After three rounds, Paul Barjon and Lee Hodges co-lead the tournament at 18-under-par. The two are followed by Tom Hoge with a single stroke behind.</p>
<p>None of the top three have won on the PGA Tour, but there are several champs still in the trophy race. World #1 Jon Rahm is still in the game, the same as legendary golfers Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler. Patrick Cantlay who finished second in the 2021 tournament is also in the competition.</p>

<p>Hodges and Barjon to Keep the Lead?</p>
<p>In the previous three rounds, we saw Lee Hodges and Paul Barjon make eight birdies each, getting to 18-under par. The good news for the two is that they’ve already completed some pretty tough holes.</p>
<p>Just behind the two leaders is veteran Tom Hoge who’s currently at 17-under par. This is his seventh appearance at PGA West in his career that started back in 2011. Hoge has featured in more than 200 events but is still without a single win.</p>
<p>What About Pre-Tournament Favorites?</p>
<p>Things have changed a lot since the start of the event. Jon Rahm, the highest-ranked golfer in the world, was the pre-tournament favorite. However, after three rounds, he’s -14 with the odds of winning currently standing at +1800.</p>
<p>Patrick Cantlay is in a similar situation with just four shots away from the leaders. He’s in a pretty decent run, while he also has a great history on this course. Last season, Cantlay nearly won the title, coming really close to Si Woo Kim on the final day when he shot 11-under, 61. The odds on Cantlay are currently +1200.</p>
<p>2022 PGA Tour American Express Prediction</p>
<p>Jon Rahm is sitting at the top of the world rankings for a reason. In 2022, he’s the best golfer in the world, meaning that he mustn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>Another reason why backing Rahm wouldn’t be dumb is that he’s famous for doing great on the final day. Proof of this is that in four of his six PGA Tour wins, Rahm shot 67 or lower on the last day.</p>
<p>Apart from having the ability to do well, Rahm also has the necessary motivation. The thing is that he could be overthrown from the #1 position in the world rankings by Collin Morikawa if he ends up winning at the DP World Tour in Dubai.</p>
<p>Ahead of Round 4, Rahm’s chances of winning the tournament don’t look that great, but he surely has what it takes to get to the Top 5.</p>
<p>Pick: Jon Rahm Top 5</p>
