<p>The new agreement with BetSkybox will increase the number of venues in Ohio offering IGT PlaySports self-servicing kiosks</p>
<p>Global supplier of gaming and lottery solutions, International Game Technology (IGT) announced it has signed an agreement with BetSkybox to expand the footprint of its PlaySports technology in Ohio.</p>
<p>Sports Betting at Bars and Restaurants</p>
<p>The agreement between IGT and BetSkybox, a division of Skybox Sports Network, will see the gambling technology supplier deploy its PlaySports QuickBet Kiosks at restaurants and bars across the state to provide them with retail sports betting.</p>
<p>Ron Frederickson, president of Skybox Sports Network/BetSkybox, commented on the development, “thrilled to deliver IGT’s award-winning sports betting technology” to BetSkybox small business partners and empower them to offer sports fans in Ohio “the convenience of PlaySports’ self-service betting solution.”</p>
<p>“IGT’s high-performing betting solutions will add another layer of excitement as patrons gather at these social establishments to watch their favorite sports and teams,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Based in Las Vegas, BetSkybox was recently approved by the Ohio Lottery and Ohio Casino Control Commission for a conditional Type C Proprietor Sports Gaming License and plans to deploy sports betting kiosks across pre-approved partner locations statewide.</p>
<p>“Expanding IGT PlaySports’ footprint in Ohio through our partnership with BetSkybox increases the opportunity for sports fans throughout the state to enjoy premium betting experiences while they are watching games at restaurants and bars,” commented Joe Asher, IGT President of Sports Betting.</p>
<p>Asher continued in his comments by highlighting the loyal and engaged fan bases of Ohio’s “high-profile professional and collegiate sports teams,” pointing to the “simplicity and intuitive nature of IGT’s PlaySports kiosks” as the key features that will “make it easy for any fan to responsibly place bets on their favorite sports teams.”</p>
<p>Sports Tickers and Odds Boards</p>
<p>In addition to the PlaySports QuickBet Kiosks, BetSkybox will provide the host locations with its core product line of sports tickers and odds boards to elevate the sports betting experience in the restaurants and bars by creating a sportsbook look and feel, utilizing light, color and motion.</p>
<p>The launch with BetSkybox is set to expand IGT PlaySports’ footprint in Ohio, a state in which the betting technology supplier has already deployed its solutions with both class A and C licensee partners, and add to the more than 80 gaming venues in the US and Canada IGT is powering with sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>The BetSkybox arrangement followed hot on the heels of an agreement reached with another type C Proprietor license holder, UBetOhio, last month under which IGT deployed its PlaySports QuickBet Kiosks at restaurants and bars across Ohio.</p>
