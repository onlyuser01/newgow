<p>American global casino and hospitality giant MGM Resorts announced a new deal with Davante Adams, a professional NFL wide receiver for the Las Vegas Raiders. According to the agreement, Adams will promote MGM Resorts’ brand as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>Adams Joins MGM as a Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Adams is notably the first active NFL player MGM Resorts has ever teamed up with. As a brand ambassador, he will be responsible for promoting the casino company. In addition, he will participate in various digital content activations and will be featured in MGM Resorts’ marketing campaigns. Adams will furthermore make appearances during MGM Rewards events at the company’s Las Vegas property.</p>
<p>Adams is best known for his time with the Green Bay Packers, a Wisconsin-based NFL team. As a part of the team, the pro athlete helped it beat its franchise record for receiving yards in a single season. To top it off, Adams is the only member of the Packers to ever score more than 100 receiving yards within two games of a single post-season. He is also famous for scoring the most touchdowns during the 2020 season and has been among the top 100 players for the last four years.</p>
<p>After eight seasons with the Packers, the football pro parted ways with the team this summer and opted to join the Las Vegas Raiders where he currently remains.</p>
<p>Lance Evans, MGM Resorts’ international senior vice president of sports and sponsorships, spoke about the agreement. He noted that his team is thrilled to welcome Adams to the MGM family and lauded the player as one of the most esteemed NFL professionals. Evans noted that Adams is a “class act both on and off the field” and praised him for his strong fan base. The SVP concluded that he is looking forward to future MGM Rewards activations, featuring Adams.</p>
<p>We are excited to welcome one of the NFL’s elite players to the family and look forward to his future engagements with our MGM Rewards members. Lance Evans, international SVP sports and sponsorships, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>Adams also commented on his agreement with the casino and hospitality giant. He noted that MGM Resorts has been exceptionally welcoming to him and his family. Because of that, Adams feels honored to become the first active athlete to ink a brand ambassador partnership with the company.</p>
<p>The football pro praised MGM Resorts as a world-class company and vowed to “continue building a legacy” in this new city [Las Vegas] he now calls home.</p>
