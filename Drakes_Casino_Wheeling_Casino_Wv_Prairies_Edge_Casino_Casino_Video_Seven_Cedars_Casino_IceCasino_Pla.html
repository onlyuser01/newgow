    <h1>Drakes Casino Wheeling Casino Wv Prairies Edge Casino Casino Video Seven Cedars Casino IceCasino Pla</h1>

<p>Thank you very much, IceCasino team, for all the provided details and data. Thanks to them, we were able to investigate the case sufficiently and made a final decision.</p>
<p>Dear Camila29,</p>
<p>After gathering and reviewing all the necessary information, and having an internal discussion with my team, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's Terms and Conditions - reasonable grounds to believe we are talking about multiple account use and the main reason - bonus abuse.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to use more than 1 account per person in the casino. If there were no bonuses used in these accounts, and there was not a breach of another rule, as the casino representative mentioned above, it would be a different situation. However, according to the provided data, it would be likely impossible to prove that you did not play with both connected accounts, although it would be the case. And, only 1 bonus is allowed per player, which means that the casino's Bonus Terms and Conditions were also violated.</p>
<p>There are several indisputable facts that indicate you played with both accounts and several inconsistencies regarding your claims:</p>
<p>Your version explaining finding and claiming the coupons/bonuses changed.</p>
<p>Both accounts used the same device/IPs for playing in the casino.</p>
<p>Email addresses contain the name of a person from another connected account.</p>
<p>Personal details in both accounts were changed, and the phone number you stated in this thread is not in any of these accounts. Also, one phone used by 2 people with 2 different numbers does not make sense.</p>
<p>The same bonuses were used on both accounts - after meeting the wagering requirements of the bonus used on the first account, the bonus money was converted to real money and played for a while, then exactly the same bonus was claimed, used, and lost on the second account later on the same day. After the bonus was lost on the second account, you logged into your account (only 2 minutes after) and continued playing with the real funds obtained from the bonus.</p>
<p>You did not play with your real money. This money was obtained from the bonus used.</p>
<p>The casino does not know about multiple account use unless full verification and account(s) checks are done, especially if we are talking about accounts registered with different personal details, which means bypassing the casino's system restrictions.</p>
<p>Basically, the casino's Ts&amp;Cs were breached at the time the same bonus was claimed and used on the second account in combination with all the circumstances stated above. Every player is obliged to read the Terms and Conditions, and you accepted them when you registered. You can find the breached rules about multiple accounts HERE (section 5) and about bonus abuse HERE (rule 16.). The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its rules, and we accept it.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that regulates the casino. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
