<p>Inter Milan Hoping to Continue Its Brilliant Run</p>
<p>Inter Milan is 3-0-0 in the 2023-24 Serie A with a score difference of 8-0. What this means is that the new goalkeeper of “Nerazzurri” hasn’t allowed a single goal since coming to Milano. The man in question is Yann Sommer, the former goalie to Borussia Monchengladbach and Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>A few more of Inter’s newcomers have been brilliant so far as well. Marcus Thuram is the one who stands out. The former Borussia Monchengladbach teammate of Sommer has really made an impact since joining his new club.</p>
<p>Still, the players who have really upped their game since the start of the 2023 season are those who have been on Inter’s roster for a while. Lautaro Martinez has been nothing short of brilliant in the 2023-24 Serie A, scoring five goals so far. It’s a similar case when it comes to left winger Federico Dimarco who, despite not scoring any goals, has been Inter’s key man so far.</p>
<p>AC Milan Want to Show the World They’re a Force to Be Reckoned With</p>
<p>Same as its city rival, AC Milan too is 3-0-0 since the start of the 2023-24 Serie A. This team’s standout performance was in its most recent game, in which they defeated AS Roma in the Italian capital. The final score was 2-1 even though AC Milan was without Fikayo Tomori for half an hour after he picked his second yellow.</p>
<p>Stefano Pioli’s team looks strong in all aspects of the game, with forward Rafael Leao being AC Milan’s standout player. This team has a few other elite forwards, but it’s the defense they should be worried about. Not only will AC Milan be without Tomori in the Derby Della Madonnina on Saturday, but the rest of its defensive department doesn’t look that great.</p>
<p>Inter Milan vs. AC Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Milan is a well-rounded team with big ambitions for the 2023-24 season. AC Milan is also a fine team, but this team’s defense looks very leaky, especially now that Tomori is suspended. That said, we just can’t see AC Milan keeping its sheet clean on Saturday. They might score a goal or two, but the hosts look more than capable of outscoring them.</p>
<p>Picks: Inter Milan to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
