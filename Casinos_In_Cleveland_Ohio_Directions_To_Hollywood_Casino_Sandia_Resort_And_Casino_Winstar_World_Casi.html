<p>One of the greatest horse racing tipsters of all times, Jody Demling, hasn’t quite stated his opinion about the upcoming 2020 Virtual Kentucky Derby taking place on Saturday, May 2. Yet, this hasn’t stopped us from taking a look ourselves.</p>
<p>2020 Virtual Kentucky Derby Overview</p>
<p>The Kentucky Derby is one of the most famous horse races in the world. The event usually takes place on the first Saturday of May and it is organized annually in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. This year it’s going to be the 146th derby, which is unfortunately postponed from May 2 to September 5 due to the coronavirus spread.</p>
<p>Join us May 2nd for a Virtual #KyDerbyAtHome Party featuring the Triple Crown Showdown where the 13 Triple Crown winners will race one another in a computer simulation under the historic Twin Spires of Churchill Downs.</p>

<p>Fans, however, will not be left disappointed. A Virtual Kentucky Derby is planned to air tomorrow, May 2. It will include a race between 13 historic Triple Crown winners. The race will take place at a virtual analog of Churchill Downs, the track length will be 1 1/4-mile as in the real derby.</p>
<p>Given the current virus outbreak, there won’t be any real betting allowed as the virtual derby will be a charity event above all else. Up to $2 million in donations to COVID-19 relief efforts will be allocated by Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>The donations will be based on punters choosing a favorite horse they wish to back. To enter the race, each punter will have to make a donation and help Churchill Downs in their effort to raise the money.</p>

<p>The Virtual Kentucky Derby Horses to Bet on Tomorrow</p>
<p>Looking at the odds for Virtual Kentucky Derby, Secretariat looks like the top pick. The horse is historically about 2 seconds quicker than any of the other contenders.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that this will be a virtual simulation, one simply cannot predict what the computer will make out of as the winner. With that being said, some help from Jody Demling would be great, even though no prediction is shared so far by the top horse racing tipster.</p>
<p>Secretariat and Citation should come as handy picks for your Trifecta, though.</p>
