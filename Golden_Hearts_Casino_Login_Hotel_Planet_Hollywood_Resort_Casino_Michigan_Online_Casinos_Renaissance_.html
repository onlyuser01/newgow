<p>Swirly Spin and Avalanche Signature Mechanics</p>
<p>The game introduces two revolutionary NetEnt signature mechanics, Swirly Spin and Avalanche, for an even more thrilling gaming experience. The Swirly Spin mechanic was first used in the Finn and the Swirly Spin slot, and it works by filling five reels and five rows with candy symbols that are seen sliding onto the grid in a spiral-shaped pattern.</p>
<p>To score a win, players must land a minimum of three matching symbols. Next, the candy symbols will vanish and trigger the Avalanche mechanic for even more potential wins.</p>
<p>Matching symbols without any wilds will trigger one wild upon payout. A win that features a wild symbol causes the special symbols to explode and destroy any symbols next to them for more empty spaces filled by the Avalanche.</p>
<p>Four Random Features and Free Spins</p>
<p>During random spins in the main game, players can activate one of four random features: Sugar Rush, Yeti Destroy, Candy Luck, and Pop Transform.</p>
<p>During the Sugar Rush feature, between two and five wild symbols can randomly land anywhere on the grid. Provided they cannot form a winning combination, fresh wilds will randomly land on the grid until they trigger a winning combination.</p>
<p>During the Yeti Destroy feature, a random number of symbols will vanish from the reels, triggering the Avalanche mechanic which, in turn, will bring players at least one winning combination. While engaged in the base game, this feature will only activate provided there are no wins on the reels.</p>
<p>During the Candy Luck feature, all symbols parts of a random row or a reel that are missing a Free Spin Key (the scatter symbol) will change into the same random low-paying or high-paying symbol, activating a winning combination along with the Avalanche mechanic.</p>
<p>The Pop Transform feature causes all low-paying symbols to turn into high-paying symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spin Key scatters can also bring players free spins whenever they pop up in the bottom left corner during random spins in the base game. While the Avalanche mechanic proceeds to destroy the winning symbols and deliver fresh ones, the scatter will move around the reels in a spiral manner via the Swirly Spin mechanic.</p>
<p>Once the scatter makes it to the middle of the grid, it will engage the Free Spins feature while setting a key meter to one. New keys will increase the key meter up to 999.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the Free Spins, players can select one of the four available Free Spins Worlds in exchange for a certain number of keys accumulated via the key meter: Wild Sugar Hub, Ice Cream Palace, Cotton Candy Lab, and Gumball Factory.</p>
<p>Evolution’s chief business development officer for Europe, Nicholas Peters, explained the new slot “exemplifies the artistry and innovation” of their team while inviting players to enjoy an enchanting journey through a universe packed with delights alongside NetEnt’s signature mechanics, features, and fresh atmospheric gameplay.</p>
<p>In July 2022, NetEnt announced inking a partnership with Holland Casino Online, a Dutch iGaming operator that would benefit from the studio’s highly-praised content.</p>
