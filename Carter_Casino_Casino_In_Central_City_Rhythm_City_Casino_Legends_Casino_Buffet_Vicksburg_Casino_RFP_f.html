    <h1>Carter Casino Casino In Central City Rhythm City Casino Legends Casino Buffet Vicksburg Casino RFP f</h1>

<p>A request for a proposal for an integrated resort will launch on January 7, 2021, revealed the Prefecture in Nagasaki, Japan. With the RFP launch, Nagasaki would become the third Prefecture to initiate the process, following Osaka and Wakayama.</p>
<p>RFP for an IR in Nagasaki Starts on January 7 Next Year</p>
<p>The Prefecture in Nagasaki, Japan, revealed that on January 7, 2021, it will launch a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an integrated resort (IR). Governor Hōdō Nakamura held a press conference on Christmas Day, revealing that the Prefecture decided to initiate the launch of an RFP in January.</p>
<p>He said that the Nagasaki Prefecture will “continue to devote efforts” toward the realization of a “Kyushu-Nagasaki IR”. According to the Governor, such resort can contribute positively toward the local economy of Kyushu and Nagasaki, but also help the “revitalization of tourism”.</p>
<p>There are a total of four Prefectures in Japan that are looking to establish an IR. These are Osaka, Wakayama, Nagasaki, and Yokohama city. Earlier this year, in March, Osaka launched its RPF and the only company that applied was MGM Resorts. The RFP in Wakayama was again launched in March and two companies showed interest – Suncity Group and Clairvest.</p>
<p>Now, considering the recent announcement, Nagasaki would become the third Prefecture to launch an RFP for an IR in Japan. It is expected that four companies would have an interest in the bid in Nagasaki. Those are: Pixel Companyz in partnership with Groupe Partouche, Get Nice Holdings collaborating with Current Corp, Oshidori International Holdings as well as Casinos Austria.</p>
<p>Japan Pushes Forward for IRs</p>
<p>Although Japan’s IR projects have seen a few hiccups, including the resignation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August, it seems that the Japanese government is eager to complete the projects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, last week, the government has finalized its Basic Policy for IRs. The initial plan was that the first IR in Japan opens by 2025, however in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that significantly restricted tourism and traveling, the application period for local governments was extended from October 1, 2021, through April 28, 2022.</p>
<p>The finalized Basic Policy for integrated resorts included new measures for public health and safety as well as additional requirements for the properties, ensuring enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols. Those changes were implemented to ensure that the casino resorts do not contribute to the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the finalized Basic Policy calls for enhancing the efforts towards gambling addiction and establishing methods for reducing gambling-related harms. With that in mind, given the newly adopted timetables and the substantial drop in the number of tourists to the country since the start of the pandemic, Japan may not have a casino resort that is ready to operate by 2025.</p>
