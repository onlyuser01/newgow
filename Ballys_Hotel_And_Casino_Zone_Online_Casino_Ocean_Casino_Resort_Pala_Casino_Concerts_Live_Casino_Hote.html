<p>Bragg Gaming Group has confirmed a new global distribution partnership with 888 Holdings, one of the world’s biggest names in online gaming and sports betting. As a result, 888 Holdings will benefit from Bragg Gaming Group’s range of outstanding games delivered directly to a number of its brands, including Mr Green, William Hill, SI Sportsbook, and not least, the eponymous 888casino gaming portal.</p>
<p>This partnership also builds on the existing strong rapport between the companies, with the two partners having previously collaborated in similar content alliances. Bragg will be also rolling out exclusive games across William Hill in the United Kingdom, and Mr Green in Italy, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
<p>888casino will also receive a fair share of games in Italy. 888casino and Bragg Gaming Group have already deployed content together in the UnitedKingdom, Spain and Ontario in 2022, the supplier said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Bragg will deliver both proprietary and exclusive content that is regulation-ready and approved in all of the companies’ targeted markets, and featuring products from Bragg Studios, including IndigoMagic and Atomic Slot Lab. Third-party partners such as the companies in the Powered by Bragg library will also be providing content to 888 Holdings’ brands.</p>
<p>In welcoming this partnership, 888 Holdings Head of Content Ofir Gal-Mor said that the company was confident in Bragg Gaming’s ability to deliver titles of the highest quality.</p>
<p>Gal-Mor added that the two companies have been working together on content deployment since early 2022, and that Bragg has already gone ahead and had successful launches with the company and will now add the William Hill and Mr Green brands to the mix.</p>
<p>The news was naturally also welcomed by Bragg Gaming Group President and COO Lara Falzon who was similarly thrilled to see this new distribution opportunity with 888 Holdings and the company’s premier brands, William Hill, and Mr Green.</p>
<p>"Our extensive portfolio of exclusive iGaming titles includes games tailored for a diverse range of tastes, enabling us to provide exceptional entertainment experiences to 888’s vast global player base," Falzon said.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming has been in the meantime developing its footprint all over Europe with the company launching its content with PlatinCasino in Spain and Microgame in in Italy.</p>
