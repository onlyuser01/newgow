<p>Information about Habanero casinos</p>
<p>Habanero Systems is a prominent casino software provider that supplies gaming content to a wide range of licensed operators. Its product selection includes video slots, online poker and interactive table games, as well as back office and API services.</p>
<p>Many casinos on the Casino Guru database offer Habanero games as part of their selection, and you can use this page to find the best ones. Read on to find out how our rating and review system will help you do this, along with information about Habanero as a company, the games it offers and how you can find bonuses from Habanero casinos.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>Habanero - a Malta-based start-up with a global iGaming network</p>
<p>Habanero was formed in 2012 in iGaming hotspot Malta. Following a significant investment from a group of entrepreneurs, the company started to build its games portfolio and to look at expanding its operations into various countries.</p>
<p>By 2016, Habanero had opened offices in South Africa, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Asia and had backed up this global presence with a series of shrewd business deals with several leading platforms. Its team included skilled developers, engineers and sales staff who knew how to produce popular high-quality content and market it well.</p>
<p>Note: The company switched all of its content — over 100 games — to HTML5 technology in the same year, replacing Adobe Flash and ensuring that it worked on mobile devices as well as desktops. The first of successive appearances at the ICE and EiG conferences followed, along with nominations for several prizes at the Asia Gaming Awards.</p>
<p>Since then, further agreements with other game providers – also featured in casinos on our database, such as Nektan and Playtech – have helped to cement Habanero's status as a leader in its field.</p>
<p>All Habanero content follows extremely strict standards with its games and Random Number Generator (RNG) licensed and certified for 16 markets. It is also translated into many languages to cater to all players within its scope.</p>
<p>Habanero Games and Software</p>
<p>Its early adoption of HTML5 software has helped Habanero produce some high-quality video slots that can be played just as easily in mobile-friendly casinos as on desktop sites. Players can also run multiple games simultaneously and switch between portrait and landscape mode whenever they want.</p>
<p>A browse through their slot collection reveals an emphasis on bright graphics and catchy titles that grab your attention. Monster Mash Cash is one such slot, with an Addams Family-style theme and creepy music to boot. The game's fun to play, too, with several bonus features to go along with fifty possible paylines. One of these is a gamble feature where you have to beat the dealer to increase your winnings. Also, look out for the Jekyll and Hyde wild symbol and a fun bonus game where you must land Dracula symbols to earn free spins.</p>
<p>For something a little easier on the eye, check out Rolling Roger – a slot based on a cute hedgehog who rolls and spins Sonic-style around the grid, collecting prizes every time you hit a combo. Don't be fooled by its childish appearance – this game has some big prizes on offer, although, like with many slots games, actually winning them is a rare event.</p>
<p>From its other titles, one of Habanero's most popular slots is Gold Rush, a game with a treasure hunt theme. Backed by energetic background music, the game consists of five reels of Wild West-style symbols. If you're lucky, you can trigger a bonus feature through special dynamite symbols that will deliver free spins – including some impressive shaking screen graphics.</p>
<p>Note: You can also try out a selection of casino table games under the Habanero name. Blackjack, roulette and video poker are all included, and each title has the Habanero feel to it, with pleasant graphics and easy, smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>All the above titles are available for you to try out for free on our list of Habanero games – giving them a spin and getting a feel for how they work is a sensible thing to do before putting down a real-money deposit.</p>
<p>How to find the best Habanero online casino for you</p>
<p>To have the safest online casino experience possible, it's important to look for certain signs when searching for a new site to play. Instead of you having to go from casino to casino, though, we've done the hard work for you and reviewed each Habanero casino on our database. On this page, you'll be able to see a concise review of each site along with a rating based on its performance.</p>
<p>There are also a series of filters that you can use to arrange the casinos according to your liking. The 'All' tab will give you the full list of Habanero sites on here, but you can also select the 'Recommended' tab to see those that pass our review with flying colors – these sites will give you the best chance of a great casino experience. The 'Newly opened' tab, meanwhile, will display the most recently added Habanero sites for you to look at.</p>
<p>Note: If you'd like to read more into the casino selection process, then our How to choose an online casino article will give you the complete account of what to consider when finding the ideal site to play on.</p>
<p>Habanero online casino bonuses</p>
<p>Landing a casino bonus is a great perk for players. No deposit bonuses are a useful way to try out a new casino without putting money down, although obtaining winnings from them do normally require you to meet wagering requirements. You can read more about these in our How casino bonuses work article. Deposit bonuses, the ones you get after making a deposit, can also be useful if used correctly.</p>
<p>Casino Guru can help you find the bonuses offered by Habanero casinos. Our list of casino bonuses is a great place to start. When there, just select the 'Habanero' name in the game provider filter. If you'd like a specific type, then just go to the 'Bonus Type' section and choose the one you need for – for no deposit bonuses, for example, choose the relevant box in that section. You can also see the same options by going to our list of no deposit bonuses and choosing 'Habanero' in the game provider filter there.</p>
<p>All these bonuses will be up to date thanks to our team's hard work in keeping the list refreshed each day.</p>
