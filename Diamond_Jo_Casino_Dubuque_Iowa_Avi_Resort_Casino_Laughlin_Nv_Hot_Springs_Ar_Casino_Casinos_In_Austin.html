<p>Caesars Windsor has opened Ontario’s pioneer sportsbook via Caesars Sportsbook at the front of the Legends Sports Bar</p>
<p>Last November, Caesars Windsor announced it would open several sports betting kiosks inside the Poker Room on the main Skybridge entrance floor. The kiosks were announced ahead of the upcoming grand opening of the much-anticipated Sportsbook Lounge of the casino in the Detroit–Windsor area.</p>
<p>Now, Ontario has finally announced that it has opened the gates to its very first full-service sportsbook thanks to Caesars Sportsbook’s launching at the venue.</p>
<p>What Can Ontario’s Sports Aficionados Expect?</p>
<p>The brand-new sportsbook features a total of seven sports betting kiosks and three betting windows spread across 1,618 square feet. The kiosks are located at the base of Skybridge, right outside the poker room and inside the new sportsbook location.</p>
<p>The new sportsbook also incorporates 22 large-screen High Definition LED TVs along with comfortable seating and state-of-the-art sound. Sports bettors will have the chance to take their pick 24/7 from a rich variety of betting options, including bets on soccer, professional football, baseball, basketball, car races, and hokey, among others.</p>
<p>All sports betting kiosks will offer detailed information and instructions on how to place bets while providing clear definitions of all sports betting terms.</p>
<p>Caesars Windsor’s president Kevin Laforet expressed their excitement to be able to provide sports bettors with the opportunity to jump on the wagon and be introduced to the action happening in their favorite sports while enjoying “the thrill of single-event betting as part of our world-class resort experience”.</p>
<p>Big Names at the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Windsor-West New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Brian Masse, Windsor’s mayor Drew Dilkens, and six-time All-Star Grant Fuhr included in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003 all attended the opening ceremony for the new sportsbook.</p>
<p>Fuhr also helped cut the symbolic ribbon and had the honor of placing the first bet. Winnings were directed to The Grant Fuhr Foundation.</p>
<p>The sportsbook project was designed with the help of Tandem Engineering Group together with Artisan Construction which was the general contractor.</p>
<p>The grand opening also introduced attendees to a number of fresh menu items from Legends Sports Bar. Wishing to give back to the community, the Caesars for a Cause charity event was also held during the grand opening of the new sportsbook. As part of the event, Caesars Windsor Cares announced it would donate $1 for every specialty menu item that Caesar would order from the Drinks &amp; Bites menu to The Hospice of Windsor and Essex County.</p>
