<p>Boyd Gaming has announced that the $50 million overhaul of the downtown Las Vegas casino was completed</p>
<p>The leading hospitality and gaming company, operating properties across Las Vegas, Boyd Gaming, has announced it completed the overhaul of the Fremont Hotel and Casino. The revamp of the downtown Las Vegas casino started last year. Only recently, Boyd confirmed that the renovation, which has a price tag of $50 million, was completed.</p>
<p>Thanks to the overhaul, visitors to Fremont Hotel and Casino can now enjoy additional gaming space. The company confirmed that 10,000 square feet were added to the gaming area, allowing 120 more games to be positioned.</p>
<p>What’s more, Boyd Gaming confirmed that the venue now offers a “more open floor plan,” looking more spacious thanks to higher ceilings. Further improvements to Fremont include a refurbished casino bar, along with a hotel lobby. Additionally, the downtown casino offers a new sportsbook and a new food hall.</p>
<p>Although the $50 million refurbishment was recently completed, Boyd confirmed that different amenities were added in a phased approach since 2022. Besides the addition of more gaming space, higher ceilings and a sports bar, the venue updated its carpeting along with other cosmetic improvements. While Fremont feels familiar it now offers more room for entertainment options.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, when Fremont opened its food hall, Boyd Gaming’s executive VP of operations, Steve Thompson, predicted that Fremont would offer a new look once the refurbishment is completed. Finally, he predicted that the venue would offer a modern look and design.</p>
<p>“Once we’re done, the entire Fremont casino will have the look and feel of this expanded casino space that you see – a modern, exciting new design for one of downtown’s most legendary properties.“ Steve Thompson, executive VP of operations at Boyd Gaming</p>
<p>The Revamped Venue Offers Dining and Entertainment Options</p>
<p>Visitors to Fremont can benefit from its food hall which is close to 14,000 square feet and offers six different dining options. Such include Tomo Noodles, Roli Roti, CRAFTkitchen, Dunkin, Huey Magoo’s and Steak ‘n Shake, a recent report released by Play USA suggests.</p>
<p>Fans of sports can engage in wagering via Fremont’s sportsbook which is FanDuel branded. However, despite the brand name, currently Boyd operates the location which means that the odds may be different than the odds offered by FanDuel.</p>
<p>Recently, several jackpots dropped at Fremont Hotel and Casino, making the visit unforgettable for lucky gamblers. On Friday, a visitor identified as Eva secured a $10.096 jackpot from the Wolf Run Eclipse slot machine.</p>
<p>Before that, on Thursday, one lucky visitor hit the jackpot by playing Pai Gow. The Fremont visitor won the game’s poker progressive jackpot, pocketing some $464,148.</p>
