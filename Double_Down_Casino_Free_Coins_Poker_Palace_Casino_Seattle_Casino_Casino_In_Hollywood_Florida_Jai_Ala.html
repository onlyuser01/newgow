<p>The Betting and Gaming Council has urged the British government to “honor its commitments” on frictionless financial risk checks. This follows a recent announcement that the Petitions Committee will discuss the issue.</p>
<p>In 2023, Nevin Truesdale, CEO of the Jockey Club, launched a petition against the affordability checks, arguing that they are discriminatory and harmful. According to him, the measure would make betting unsustainable for many people, forcing them to go to the black market.</p>
<p>Truesdale’s petition eventually surpassed its target goal of 100,000 signatures. As a result, the Petitions Committee confirmed that a debate will be held on February 26.</p>
<p>In the wake of this announcement, the BGC praised Truesdale’s petition. The council reiterated its support for “frictionless, enhanced spending checks online.” According to the body, such measures must target people who exhibit signs of harm, allowing swift intervention.</p>
<p>However, the council also agrees that this measure must be truly frictionless and must not interfere with the vast majority of gamblers who play safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>Dugher Praised Truesdale’s Initiative</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chief executive officer, weighed in on the matter, saying that the Parliament must honor its commitment to make the checks truly frictionless.</p>
<p>At the BGC we supported enhanced checks for online gambling, but have been clear throughout that checks should be carefully targeted on those showing signs of problem gambling, or those who are at risk of harm, so operators can use technology to take swift action. Michael Dugher, CEO, BGC</p>
<p>Dugher pointed out that a vast majority of punters in the UK have made it clear that they will not submit to intrusive checks. Since many players play safely and responsibly, the government must be careful not to drive them to the unregulated black market, the BGC CEO said. Dugher added that his team is closely working with the UK Gambling Commission to make sure that there would be a proper pilot before a permanent change is introduced.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dugher congratulated Nevin Truesdale for helping to secure an “important parliamentary debate.”</p>
<p>Nevin Truesdale and his team have injected a much-needed dose of common sense. Too often, the debate around gambling has been dominated by a handful of out-of-touch anti-gambling prohibitionists whose enthusiasm for draconian changes would wreck great British sports like racing. Michael Dugher, CEO, BGC</p>
<p>The BGC CEO added that blanket measures would endanger the British gambling sector. This sector, he reminded, contributes £7.1 billion (roughly $9 million) to the economy a year, generates £4.2 billion ($5.3 billion) in tax and supports some 110,000 jobs.</p>
