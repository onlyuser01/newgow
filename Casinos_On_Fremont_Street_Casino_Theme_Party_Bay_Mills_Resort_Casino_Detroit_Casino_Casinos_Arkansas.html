    <h1>Casinos On Fremont Street Casino Theme Party Bay Mills Resort Casino Detroit Casino Casinos Arkansas</h1>

<p>I have had an absolute NIGHTMARE with this awful casino. I have been lied to and messed about beyond belief.</p>
<p>I am fully verified and have managed one withdrawal to my skrill for 300 euros. Then all the problems started.</p>
<p>I attempted to withdraw 400 euros. The withdrawal was pending for 2 weeks! I kept being told to be patient, the money will be sent. Then it was cancelled. I chased on email and after being ignored for almost a week they came back asking me to detail my question in more detail! I sent another email with the issue and screengrabs. I got a response saying 'The withdrawal was processed fine', referring to my 300 withdrawal. AT THIS POINT I LOST PATIENCE. I did another withdrawal of 500 and this one was cancelled (three weeks into this at this point). I was then told it was a system error and would be fixed. I said I was appalled and wouldn't play here and wanted my full balance sent to me by any means, bank transfer, crypto etc as I believe the casino is short on money or is going bust and they are trying delaying tactics.</p>
<p>The casino responded to the above by now saying they needed EXTRA verification (despite me being verified) me holding my passport and a piece of paper, then me taking a selfie of ever page of my passport and another ID document if I have one. ABSOLUTE NONESCENE and done because I requested my full balance due to terrible treatment. Im verified, have had one withdrawal, only have one ID and not sending them copious amounts of selfies when they have done this to withhold winnings further.</p>
<p>Please help, this is clearly against your fair gaming code.</p>
