<p>Slots fans are in for a treat after Red Tiger, one of Evolution’s brands, has announced the launch of a new slot inspired by TV series.</p>
<p>Red Tiger Announces the Launch of a New TV-Inspired Slot</p>
<p>Red Tiger’s new title dubbed Narcos Mexico Slot is inspired by the famous TV series Narcos: Mexico. The famous TV series continues the story of the highly-popular Netflix series Narcos, telling the story about the drug trade in Mexico during the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>“This is our second Narcos game, with the first one being done by the team at NetEnt.” Todd Haushalter, chief product officer at Evolution Gaming</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming’s chief product officer, Todd Haushalter, said that this isn’t the first Narcos-inspired game. Moreover, he explained that the company has seen significant success by sharing intellectual property between Red Tiger and NetEnt. As an example, Haushalter pointed out are the popular games Piggy Riches and Gonzo’s Quest.</p>
<p>“It’s always exciting working with branded games, and we’ve been part of some brilliant partnerships. This new Narcos Mexico Slot is a great example of this and it’s going to attract new and casual players in a big way.” Todd Haushalter, chief product officer at Evolution Gaming</p>
<p>Haushalter predicted that the new Nacros Mexico slot game will undoubtedly attract new as well as casual slot players. In conclusion, he explained that the new game places the players in a fast money world where they will face unexpected challenges.</p>
<p>Narcos Mexico Slot Brings Exciting Experiences for Players</p>
<p>According to Red Tiger, the game places the players in a “world of fast money and dangerous vices.” There, they will meet and fight with notorious gangsters and even rival bosses. Additionally, Narcos Mexico slot players can experience high volatility thanks to a new functionality called Cartel Wars.</p>
<p>By matching mystery symbols, players can fight against rivals and win territory. What is more, the new title features a special Cartel Spins with Exchange function. That functionality allows players that have won 100x of their stake or more to exchange it for three special spins.</p>
