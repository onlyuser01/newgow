<p>Las Vegas Police Arrest ‘Reckless Rider’ Who Rode Dirt Bike Through Casinos</p>

<p>Las Vegas police said Thursday they arrested a man on suspicion of riding a dirt bike through the gaming floors of “multiple casinos,” and up and down stairs and escalators. He is also accused of “doing wheelies” along Las Vegas Boulevard.</p>

<p>Police didn’t name the casinos or reveal the reckless daredevil’s identity. But in a social media post announcing the arrest, they published a photograph of the detainee in handcuffs. A large emoticon is superimposed over his face and he wears a T-shirt bearing the legend: “Till the Fuckin’ Wheels Fall Off.”</p>
<p>The suspect, described as a “known reckless rider,” has been charged with numerous offenses. These include felony counts of a driver disobeying a police officer and of endangering a person or property, four gross counts of reckless driving, and one felony count of assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>R.A.I.D.</p>
<p>“The rider thought he would never get caught. Our R.A.I.D. Team was able to conduct surveillance along with marked units, and the air unit was able to take this #RecklessRider into custody without incident. His truck and dirt bike were towed,” read the tweet Thursday by LVMPD Traffic Bureau.</p>
<p>The arrest is mysterious not simply because the name of the suspect has been withheld. Casino.org has been unable to find any recent video footage of a biker riding through Las Vegas casinos or any social media chatter about an incident that would have likely attracted significant attention.</p>
<p>Established in March 2022, “R.A.I.D.” is LVMPD’S Racing Apprehension and Intervention Detail unit, which focuses on the rising trend of illegal street racing and street takeovers in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Street Takeovers</p>
<p>Street takeovers involve a crowd of people gathering to block traffic while drivers perform often dangerous stunts.</p>
<p>Over and over and over again, we see them losing control, hitting people, going into the crowd, causing multiple injuries,” R.A.I.D.’s Lt. Daryl Rhoads told local media in April. “We knew we couldn’t allow this activity to happen on our Strip when we have a million tourists that are in town. If this infected our Strip and our tourist corridor, it could really hurt Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>Rhoads added that without the intervention of the R.A.I.D team, the problem in Las Vegas would be much worse. “We’ve brought this RAID team into Las Vegas before Las Vegas became like an L.A. We had the foresight to see this problem emerging,” he said.</p>
<p>In the first year of its existence, R.A.I.D. made 185 arrests, cited 238 people, and towed 215 cars, according to Rhoads.</p>
