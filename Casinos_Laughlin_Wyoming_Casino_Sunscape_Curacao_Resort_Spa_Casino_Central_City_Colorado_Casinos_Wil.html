<p>Thank you very much, Henmah, for the forwarded live chat transcript. I understood that you have requested a permanent account closure since you were not happy with promotional offers, is that correct?</p>
<p>Let me explain to you what is the difference between closing the account and self-exclusion:</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling and I would not mention them here. What players can do if they’re unhappy in the casino: Close the account or self-exclude themselves, that are the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost no impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agree not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (after cooling off period and this cannot be done for players who’s are addicted/with gambling problem)</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that you have requested later for the reopening of your casino account?</p>
