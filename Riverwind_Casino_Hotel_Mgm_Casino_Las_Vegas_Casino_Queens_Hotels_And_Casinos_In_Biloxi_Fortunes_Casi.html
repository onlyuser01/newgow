<p>Malta-based online casino operator PressEnter Group continued to bolster its management team with the appointment of Therese Thagaard as the company’s Chief Legal Officer.</p>
<p>Highly Accomplished Legal Professional</p>
<p>The appointment of the former group head of Regulatory Strategy and Implementation at LeoVegas Thagaard brings to PressEnter Group a highly accomplished lawyer with sufficient gaming industry experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on Thagaard’s appointment, PressEnter Group chief executive officer Lahcene Merzoug outlined that the new addition is expected to play a significant role in the company’s “next phase of growth,” seeking to build on its reputation as an “employer of choice.”</p>
<p>“Her vast knowledge and expertise will help us to recruit, develop and train the next legal stars within our quick-paced industry and make sure PressEnter has the best legal representation in-house whilst also creating opportunities for young lawyers as they join our team,” added Merzoug, feeling privileged to have Thagaard join the business and excited to welcome her to the team.</p>
<p>In her new role, Thagaard will be responsible for the further development of the legal team at PressEnter Group, alongside the team’s expansion to ensure enough legal capacity in support of the operator’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>‘Exciting Stage’ of Business Development</p>
<p>Recognizing the “exciting stage” of PressEnter Group’s development and excited to become part of this development, Thagaard was eager to start “building a team to help the business navigate the ever-changing legal and regulatory landscape in the worldwide iGaming industry.”</p>
<p>Thagaard’s gaming industry experience included three-and-a-half years serving as legal counsel for the Nordics at Kindred Group before joining LeoVegas in September 2021 as senior legal and compliance counsel. LeoVegas promoted her to group head of Regulatory and Strategy in April this year.</p>
<p>Her career, which began in 2004 as a paralegal for the Department for Work and Pensions in London, also includes almost ten years working as a solicitor with Davis &amp; Co law firm prior to joining Kindred Group in April 2018.</p>
<p>Holder of Bachelor of Honors degree from Brunel University in London, Thagaard attended legal practice course on commercial law, advanced civil litigation and advanced commercial property at Kaplan Law School.</p>
<p>Thagaard is the latest in a series of high-profile appointments at PressEnter Group as the business is preparing for its next stage of growth with the most recent one the appointment of Daniela Speranza as Director of Compliance in July.</p>
<p>A month earlier, the Malta-based group added another former Kindred Group executive – former head of Delivery and Portfolio Management Nicolas Renaux – as its Head of Strategy and Business Development.</p>
