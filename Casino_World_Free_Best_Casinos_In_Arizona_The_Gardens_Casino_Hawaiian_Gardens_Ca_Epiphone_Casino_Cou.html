    <h1>Casino World Free Best Casinos In Arizona The Gardens Casino Hawaiian Gardens Ca Epiphone Casino Cou</h1>

<p>I"ve had a withdrawal the past 6 times and on every withdrawal i had to verify details and i play a number of casinos 12 to be precise and slots hall is the only 1 which delays withdrawal requests by using verification process. Also in their terms it states withdrawals will be done in up to 48hrs but it can take up to 2 weeks sometimes and longer if the player does not intervene.</p>
<p>So on my last 1 i had even told them they could even close my account down as long as my 5k was processed and 5 minutes later it was processed and the account was closed.</p>
<p>This goes to show of what narrow business minded staff slots hall has and how they treat their players and yes i really am a big player at slots hall or should i say was.</p>
<p>Are they really fit to be pary of the casinos offered to play or should be a blacklisted casino as if you look at the way they treat their customers.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
