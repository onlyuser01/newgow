<p>theScore Bet believes that the time to “Get into Bet Mode” is right now. The company’s new marketing campaign comes in lockstep with the National Football League season which is expected to be one of the busiest this year, with legalization expansion happening across both sides of the border. The new advertisement spots feature a number of Canadian personalities, including Patrick J. Adams, Jon Lovitz, and Russell Peters.</p>
<p>Get into Bet Mode with theScore</p>
<p>They will all be part of theScore Bet’s promotional push in Canada and beyond, hoping to bring more people interested in sports betting to the platform. Commenting on this release, theScore SVP of content and marketing Aubrey Levy said:</p>
<p>We’re bringing back our GET INTO BET MODE campaign with new themes and new talent as we enter the action-packed fall sports season. theScore SVP of content and marketing Aubrey Levy</p>
<p>theScore Bet wants to place the emphasis of its new campaign on educating sports bettors who are eyeing the prospect of placing a wager on the 2022 NFL season. theScore is hoping that fans will re-engage with its offer this fall and that the campaign will help contribute to and grow theScore’s audiences during the 2022/2023 betting season.</p>
<p>“Specifically, we’ve significantly upgraded our product with increased sports betting options and have expanded our iCasino catalog, Levy explained. All three people that are now featured as part of the advertisement efforts are distinct and provide the company with the perfect opportunity to reach out to and engage with sports fans.</p>
<p>The campaign’s name is not just a play of words, it’s also a reference to the BET MODE function that is part of theScore app experience. BET MODE essentially seeks to elevate the sports betting experience by integrating theScore’s products into a single-access point for all things that the company can offer – from media experience to sports betting options.</p>
