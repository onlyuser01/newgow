    <h1>Sandia Casino In Albuquerque Circus Circus Casino Boat Casino Near Me Hotels Close To Firekeepers Ca</h1>

<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is close to re-opening the casino application process but an interesting development seems to be overshadowing those plans for now. This new development is a newly proposed gaming facility in southeastern Massachusetts. Now, the state gaming regulator is seeking public input from the residents located in Region C on whether they should allow the establishment of a new casino in the region which includes Plymouth, Bristol, Nantucket, Barnstable, and Dukes counties.</p>
<p>The gaming commission has also filed an official request that asks a number of market research firms in the state to avail more details on the proposed casino. According to one of the members of the commission, they are looking for a reputable and experienced research firm that will be able to provide enough specific questions. These questions will be geared towards getting responses related to the gambling market and the expected economic impacts should a new casino be opened in southeastern Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The goal of this process is pretty simple. That is, it will be a great way for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to better understand the viability of the market. By comparing the information, they receive with those from previous studies and results, they can have a deeper insight into what might become of the proposed casino. Naturally, there is going to be a lot of emphasis on the potential benefits of the project.</p>
<p>Both the residents and the research firms in question now have up to March 16 to submit their inputs before the gambling watchdog proceeds to make a decision.</p>
<p>Previous Efforts</p>
<p>As it turns out, Region C has been a prime candidate for a casino gaming license. About four years ago, the state gaming regulator declined the proposal by a gaming company to build a casino in Plymouth County. The casino which was to be located at the Brockton Fairgrounds did not get enough backing since it was believed that it would directly compete against the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe’s First Light Resort and Casino that is located in Taunton. Needless to say, this was not something that the state was willing to deal with at the time.</p>
<p>“The prospect of the tribe eventually getting a casino in Taunton was going to have an end result in which we would have not one, but two casinos from that region, with the tribe paying zero percent in taxes to the state.” Massachusetts Gaming Commission’s Commissioner Enrique Zuniga.</p>
<p>However, things have since changed especially with regards to the revenue that the state receives from the gambling sector. This upswing in revenue makes the prospects of yet another gambling destination very enticing but it all has to be in-line with the laws and acceptable by the residents of the proposed casino locations.</p>
