<p>Here’s one MLS game that we think might cause a shock for the bookmakers. The thing is that practically all online sportsbooks see New England Revolution as the odds-on favorite in Saturday’s game against Toronto FC. Judging by their current standings in the Eastern Conference, one would think that the bookies are right to favor the team from Foxborough.</p>
<p>However, the Canadian franchise signed a couple of extraordinary players earlier this month. Those players have already made a huge impact on Toronto’s performance. The evidence of this is that the Reds demolished Charlotte FC 4-0 last weekend in what was Toronto’s biggest win in the MLS since 2019.</p>

<p>No Wins for New England Revolution in Five MLS Rounds</p>
<p>New England Revolution is sitting three spots higher than Toronto FC in the Eastern Conference standings with four points more, as well as one game fewer. However, the guys from Massachusetts haven’t been too impressive lately.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s far from it – they’re without a win in their previous five MLS games, losing two of those and tying three.</p>
<p>To be fair to them, they did face some really tough opponents, namely, the Vancouver Whitecaps, FC Cincinnati, New York City FC, Philadelphia Union, and Columbus Crew. Unfortunately for New England Revolution, their next opponent too is a real heavyweight since recently.</p>
<p>Toronto’s Italians Ready to Challenge the Playoffs</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago, it seemed impossible that Toronto FC would be able to compete for a spot in the playoffs. However, earlier in July, this team’s management did a fantastic job on the transfer market, signing a couple of amazing players.</p>
<p>Three of those look like real game-changers. The guys in question are Italian players who are coming off a pretty impressive season in Serie A – Lorenzo Insigne, Fernando Bernardeschi, and Domenico Criscito.</p>
<p>Insigne (forward) played for Napoli last season, scoring 11 goals and making eight assists in the Italian top-flight. Bernardeschi (attacking midfielder) played for Juventus, scoring a goal and making three assists last season. Criscito (center back) scored six goals for Genoa last season, while also dominating the air in front of their goal.</p>
<p>New England Revolution vs Toronto FC Prediction</p>
<p>This is not going to be an easy game for Toronto FC, but we believe Bob Bradly and his boys will get a win. They have the player quality, as well as the motivation to do so.</p>
<p>Pick: Toronto FC</p>
