<p>Iowa is the latest state to give sports betting a serious consideration. Despite a rather fraught legal context, the state seems determined to introduce the activity in its fulness, including online wagers.</p>
<p>Iowa Joins the States to Be Pushing for Legal Sports Betting</p>
<p>With the Department of Justice (DOJ) playing chicken with individual states across the United States, Iowa is bringing in a fresh élan in the fight against attempts to repress sports betting.</p>
<p>Despite the re-interpreted Wire Act Opinion, Iowa seems concerned with only one thing – making sure that a sports betting bill can clear all legal hurdles ahead.</p>
<p>One such bill is Senate Study Bill 1168, which has given sports betting supporters high hopes that change is imminent in Iowa.</p>
<p>Introduced by Senator Roby Smith, Chair of the Committee on State Government, the bill is a carefully considered move and not a rushed-up fear of missing-out.</p>
<p>Besides, there are new challenges to consider as well, one of which is the aforementioned validity of any betting or gambling should the DOJ get its way – chances are it won’t, not by a long stretch.</p>
<p>Why Stop at Land-Based Sportsbooks? Iowa Goes Mobile</p>
<p>Bill 1168 plans to see all licensed properties across the state offer sports betting offers, with estimated 19 racetracks, casinos and parlours now operating in Iowa. Sports betting has been lacking a certain fizzle in the United States, but states are waking up to the importance of offering remote betting options.</p>
<p>As such, Iowa’s new bill includes a mobile wagering proviso as long as people are willing to go to a land-based venue to register.</p>
<p>In its own right, Bill 1168 is exciting news for betting fans and enthusiasts. Still, there are a few details missing out of the text, but these might be intentional omissions left there to try and involve mildly opposed parties to reconsider.</p>
<p>For example, the bill makes no mention of the specific amounts of taxation that such venues will be subject to, although it lets it be known that licenses will have to be renewed every year by paying a yet undetermined fee. Here’re more insights from the bill:</p>
<p>No royalty fees will be featured in the new sports betting bill. The idea has been widely ruled out in almost all states that are pondering the introduction of the activity.</p>

<p>The chances ahead of Bill 1168 look very solid. What’s needed moving forth is a broader legal coalition. Even if Iowa’s bill makes the cut though, local lawmakers will have to face up against DOJ’s newly-introduced restrictions.</p>
