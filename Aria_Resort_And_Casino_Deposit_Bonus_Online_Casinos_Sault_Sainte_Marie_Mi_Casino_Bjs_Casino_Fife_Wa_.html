<p>Another boxing bout is booked for this Saturday, October 23 at 10:30 pm EST when Jamel Herring will take on Shakur Stevenson in what appears to be a heavily one-sided bout.</p>
<p>While Stevenson is posted at (-700) his opponent will be competing for the WBO super featherweight title and will do his best to overcome the slim (+500) odds he is given.</p>
<p>The fight between the two will take place at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, and be broadcasted on ESPN and ESPN+. DraftKings gives Stevenson a sure fight, but we are not entirely convinced this is the case.</p>
<p>Odds to Win Jamel Herring vs Shakur Stevenson</p>
<p>Fighter Odds Shakur Stevenson -700 Jamer Herring +500 Odds as of October 22 at DraftKings</p>
<p>Both of these fighters are fairly evenly matched in terms of physical attributes. They have both been distinguished as Olympians and they bring a lot of prowess to the boxing ring. Herring is posted as a heavy underdog and we find out why.</p>
<p>Where and When to Watch Herring vs Stevenson</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, October 23</p>
<p>: Saturday, October 23 Time : 10:30 pm EST</p>

<p>Prediction for Jamel Herring vs Stevenson</p>
<p>The odds pricing, in our opinion, is not entirely fair. Herring is much older than his opponent. In fact, he is 11 years his senior and bookmakers are definitely looking into this, but we do think that this may be a bit misleading.</p>
<p>Stevenson is definitely a favorite and there is no denying that, but is (-700) against just (+500) for Herring fair? We don’t think so. In fact, we are convinced that it creates a value-betting opportunity whereby the underdog has a great ace up his sleeve to play.</p>
<p>His overall career record is 23-2-0 and his last loss was back in 2017 to Ladarius Miller. He has fought numerous opponents since and defeated Carl Frampton earlier this year. His last four victories have been brought in by decision and KO.</p>
<p>Tale of the Tape: Stevenson vs Herring</p>
<p>Stevenson Vs. Herring 16-0 Record 23-2 8 KOs 11 5’7″ Height 5’10” 68″ Reach 68″ Southpaw Stance Southpaw</p>
<p>Stevenson Is the Underdog, That’s Alright</p>
<p>What about Shakur Stevenson then? Look, the man is an excellent boxer. He had the WBO featherweight champion title between 2019 and 2020. So, can Stevenson really deliver on the performance that is asked of him?</p>
<p>We believe there is a significant chance of this happening but probably not at the convincing rate predicted by the bookmakers. However, Stevenson’s expertise is truly what matters here.</p>
<p>He has incredible footwork, he is very mobile, and knows how to land punches without getting hit. Stevenson is also perfectly capable of conserving energy to make sure that he makes the distance.</p>
<p>However, here is the rub. Herring is perfectly capable to deliver a great performance, but the bookies question not his technique, but his ability to stay in the fight. We will recommend picking the favorite here, but just in case, you can have a few bucks on the underdog however slim the chances.</p>
