<p>The tech and e-commerce giant’s media arm continues to invest in sports-related content and will likely use the newly added channel to gauge interest in a standalone sports app. Amazon has maintained ties with several operators and may attempt further forays in that direction, relying on partnerships for additional gambling content.</p>
<p>SportsGrid Complements Amazon’s Existing Content</p>
<p>As the newest addition to Amazon Prime Video’s FreeVee platform, SportsGrid offers a lot of exciting content covering all major US leagues. The network launched in 2018 and quickly branched out into wagering and fantasy sports content thanks to partnerships with high-profile operators like FanDuel, BetMGM, and WynnBet. SportsGrid president and co-founder Louis Maione was excited to join Amazon Prime, sharing his hopes for a successful and long-lasting partnership.</p>
<p>We look forward to the Amazon partnership to innovate and develop new tools to engage and redefine the sports viewers’ betting experience. Louis Maione, President and Co-Founder of SportsGrid</p>
<p>The new Prime and FreeVee channel will be joining more than 200 free and features over thirty engaging shows, with expert analysts and live odds supplementing the hottest sports action. With an active presence on social media and streaming services like Roku, YouTube TV, and Fubo, SportsGrid should be a valuable addition to Amazon’s roster, drawing a substantial dedicated audience.</p>
<p>A New Amazon Sports App May Be Underway</p>
<p>SportsGrid’s addition marks another significant milestone in Amazon Prime’s plans to become the leading sports content provider. The network has been doubling down on its ambitions, investing billions in exclusive content covering “Thursday Night Football,” New York Yankees games, and the English Premier League. With several new high-budget sports talk shows, Amazon can provide a complete roster of sports-related content.</p>
<p>The next step in Amazon’s plans likely revolves around the rumored upcoming sports app, which would give the network tighter control over its content and allow for more extensive monetization options. Such a move would be characteristic of the tech and e-commerce giant and could pave the way for additional forays into sports betting.</p>
<p>Amazon is no stranger to partnering with gambling operators. In September 2022, the company joined forces with DraftKings, picking them as a sponsor for Thursday Night Football on Amazon’s Prime Video in a multi-year agreement. A shift towards more third-party betting content would significantly bolster the rumored app’s profitability with minimum effort required on Amazon’s part.</p>
