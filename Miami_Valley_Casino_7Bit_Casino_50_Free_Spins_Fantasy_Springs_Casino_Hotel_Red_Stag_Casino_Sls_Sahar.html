<p>ComeOn Group has announced a new head of customer engagement to help the iGaming operator expand its reach and bolster its team across the board</p>
<p>Owen Parry, who will be stepping into the new position, will transition to this new office to ensure that he works on driving stronger customer engagement across ComeOn’s entire portfolio.</p>
<p>ComeOn Continues to Promote from Within</p>
<p>In his role, he will seek to help with building a strong rapport with the target audience and create small decisions and strategies that allow ComeOn to expand. ComeOn is similarly determined to continue promoting from within as the company wants to give existing team members a further field for self-expression and the chance to prove themselves in a more demanding business environment.</p>
<p>Parry will play a crucial role in the company’s further expansion and help deliver a personalized service through the sportsbook. All of this will be done to ensure that players enjoy a safer experience across the board.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, ComeOn Group chief data officer Sherwin Jarvand said that the entire company was very proud to see another trusted company member progress to this new position. Jarvand was recently appointed under the same program.</p>
<p>“Offering a best-in-class player engagement across all our customer’s touch points is always at the front of our minds and with Owen leading this area now, we are in safe hands to take this strategic goal to the next level,” Jarvand explained.</p>
<p>Driving Success Through Customer Engagement and Personalization</p>
<p>ComeOn Group has been amping up its commitment under the People Strategy imitative which has seen a number of established team members progress further the corporate ladder. Among them are Matthew Cawston who became director of marketing and operations and Robert Rothman who recently stepped in as director of performance marketing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, ComeOn Group has been strengthening its local partnerships, including with Pragmatic Play in the Netherlands and by expanding its own operational capacities in the Nordics. The company launched the Nordic Ruby Lounge to bring even more fresh experiences to players.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group is one of the best-established industry players. The company was founded in 2008 and it helps dozens of brands in some of the world’s most competitive markets to deliver an immaculate product to their clients.</p>
<p>ComeOn delivers solutions for the casino and sports betting sectors in equal measure and nurturing internal talent has been a key ingredient for this success.</p>
