    <h1>Tres Reyes Casino Deadwood Casinos Circus Circus Hotel Casino Casino Castles Harrogate Graton Resort</h1>

<p>Hello Andrei,</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say I am very disappointed, especially since my net profit is always mentioned. But the fact that I have paid in over €25,000 at a wide variety of casino providers over the past 3 years and have not won anything needs to be said.</p>
<p>The amount was won because there is nothing to shake. It doesn't matter which device I played on or which password I made afterwards. Yes, I changed my password afterwards and used the same one as my friend. I'm sure I've also played a game or two, or tell me who is paying out a number such as €3,468.51.</p>
<p>A success if the terms and conditions are formulated more precisely. There is nothing to read that I am not allowed to use the same password as an acquaintance, only that I have to keep it secret and that is a fact. No one has to tell me exactly what to write down in my password.</p>
<p>Sometimes you win sometimes you lose, that's also the reason why I deposited over €8,000 in another casino in December until last week. And don't have a good balance. I was even written to by support, who credited me with €200 due to the high level of activity.</p>
<p>After consulting Patrick, we are of the same opinion as probably many others:</p>
<p>why is it reprehensible to have the same password as your mother or parents?</p>
<p>If you have a very strong and good bond, live in the same household and one of them may be ill or slightly forgetful, isn't it an advantage?</p>
<p>Personally, I have to say that even if my bond with my parents is not that strong, I still have a similar password.</p>
<p>We are adults who have been working shifts in an oil factory for years and are earning a handsome salary, why should we or he need to put money into Mom's credit card?</p>
<p>Bonus was not used here, as it is known that it is not recommended to play or buy games with feature buy with bonus money.</p>
<p>To the next point. You just meant "nowadays when online payments are quick and easy, money can easily be swapped back and forth between bank accounts"</p>
<p>Are you kidding me here? With such wishy-washy statements? So the same goes for the other thousands of players on Tsars too! Anyone can deposit and withdraw money. Only I need a TAN for every transaction, whether with a current account, via a separate app with a password or via the Mastercard via a TAN procedure via SMS.</p>
<p>So it is impossible for another person to make a deposit on my behalf!</p>
<p>You have your opinion, we have ours, in the end you have the upper hand. That's why I ended up here and shared my impressions with an intermediary like Casino Guru. Since I have no happy or nice game results here with you because of exactly these statements.</p>
<p>Since I won this amount, I've already told my friends, booked a vacation, got into debt and got into so many arguments with close people, because the situation really bothered me! Sleepless nights, high blood pressure and headaches. Of course, I'm now being accused of having everything made up or conjured up out of a hat, but you're welcome to tell my partner that I almost lost it because of it.</p>
<p>And that's exactly why I changed the password. I wanted to stop playing. Finding an end again with a win. Thanks to you I can't.</p>
