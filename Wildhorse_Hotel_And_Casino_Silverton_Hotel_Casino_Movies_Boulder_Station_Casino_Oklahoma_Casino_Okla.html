<p>Online gaming and betting giant BetMGM has enhanced its iGaming lineup with the addition of games from NetGaming. The creative casino games developer will supply the operator’s Michigan-facing business with games.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, launches in other states are also planned.</p>
<p>The BetMGM Casino in Michigan is notably the first online operator in the United States to offer NetGaming’s exciting iGaming content. The brand’s players in the state will now be able to access many engaging online casino games, such as 3 Wild Jokers, Skulls Gone Wild and the Shelby Online Video Slot.</p>
<p>The latter game is a branded title released in collaboration between NetGaming and Carrol Shelby, a legendary car manufacturer. The unique title attests to NetGaming’s drive for innovation, which is also reflected in its other games.</p>
<p>The studio’s content is rich in nature, covering distinctive themes and offering exciting gaming experiences. It will be a great addition to BetMGM’s extensive online casino portfolio, which currently encompasses more than 1,500 games.</p>
<p>BetMGM boasts the largest state-by-state in-house progressive jackpot network and awarded $100 million in progressive jackpots in 2022 alone. In the first half of 2023, meanwhile, the casino giant provided an additional $75 million in jackpots to its fans. One of its latest winners, for example, won a life-changing $2.4 million jackpot.</p>
<p>BetMGM Wants to Provide Players with a Choice</p>
<p>BetMGM’s director of gaming, Oliver Bartlett, said that his team is driven by the desire to provide players with a choice. To that end, BetMGM is always on the lookout for the most entertaining, fresh and exclusive content available on the market, Bartlett noted.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be working with NetGaming, as they have an exciting portfolio of games that will appeal to our customers in Michigan and beyond. Oliver Bartlett, director of gaming, BetMGM</p>
<p>Pallavi Deshmukh, NetGaming’s chief executive officer, also expressed her delight in teaming up with BetMGM. She lauded the launch in Michigan as a testament to NetGaming’s hard work over the years.</p>
<p>Securing a long-term deal with the top iGaming operator in the U.S. is extremely exciting and we look forward to working with BetMGM to deliver entertaining games. Pallavi Deshmukh, CEO, NetGaming</p>
<p>Deshmukh added that this is but the beginning of what she hopes to be a long and fruitful partnership with the American gambling juggernaut.</p>
<p>In other news, BetMGM recently posted its H1 results, demonstrating strong financial performance. NetGaming, on the other hand, recently supplied content to Novibet in Greece.</p>
