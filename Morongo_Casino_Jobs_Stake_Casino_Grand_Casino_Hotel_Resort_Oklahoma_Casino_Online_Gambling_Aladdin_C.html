<p>Information about roulette</p>
<p>Roulette is one of the most popular games, in both online and brick-and-mortar casinos. If you want to enjoy roulette without risking your money, pick one of the games on this list and start playing.</p>
<p>All of the games are identical to those you can find in online casinos when playing for real money. They have the same design, features and payout ratios, with the only difference being the fact that you are playing just for fun in a demo mode.</p>

<p>Learn roulette rules before playing</p>
<p>Online roulette games you can play for free are a great way to get to know the game of roulette and its rules. However, it doesn’t hurt to learn more about the game, which you can do by reading our article about roulette rules. It will teach you everything you need to know to play roulette.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that’s not necessarily needed. Roulette is a very simple game. You basically just need to place a bet on any number or other sections on the roulette table layout and wait for the result of the spin. You can’t influence the result of the game and almost all bets have the same return to player, so the only thing you can influence is the volatility (by changing the types of bets you place).</p>
<p>Note: We mentioned that almost all bets have the same RTP. There is a bet on American roulette on five numbers (0, 00, 1, 2 and 3), which has the worst payout ratio you can get on a roulette table. If you ever play roulette for real money, you should definitely stay away from this bet, and ideally from American roulette in general, as well. Check out our full list of roulette odds to learn more about the differences between various types of roulette bets.</p>
<p>Free European, American and French roulette games</p>
<p>That brings us to the types of roulette you can play. There are two main types of roulette:</p>
<p>European roulette – This type of roulette has 37 sections on the roulette wheel (0 and numbers from 1 to 36).</p>
<p>– This type of roulette has 37 sections on the roulette wheel (0 and numbers from 1 to 36). American roulette – This type of roulette has 38 sections on the roulette wheel (0, 00 and number s from 1 to 36).</p>
<p>The number of possible outcomes is different, but the multiples of your bet you get when you win are the same. That means American roulette has a worse RTP (94.74%) than European roulette (97.3%). You should therefore play European roulette whenever it’s available, because your chances of winning are quite a lot higher. Of course, this doesn’t really matter when playing just for fun, but it doesn’t hurt to pick the better version nevertheless.</p>
<p>Besides European and American roulette, there is also French roulette. It is very similar to European roulette but has some additional rules in favor of the player, which make this type of Roulette player even better for players in terms of minimizing the casino’s advantage. Feel free to read our article about differences between various types of roulette if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>Note: It’s easy to find an American or European roulette to play for free, while free French roulette games are scarcer. French roulette is mostly available in live dealer versions, which are generally not available in a demo mode. You should be able to find a French roulette game in many of casinos with live games we have in our database though.</p>
<p>Can you play free roulette on mobile devices?</p>
<p>Not all versions of free roulette in our database are playable from mobile devices, but many of them are. If you want to see only games which can be played using mobile phones and tablets, you can use the filter "Mobile Devices Supported".</p>
<p>Note: Unfortunately, some of the games still need a Flash player to run, which is the reason why they can be played only on computers. However, popular older games often get reworked using newer technologies, so some games you can’t play from mobile devices at the moment might be accessible to you in the future.</p>
<p>Try out our roulette strategies</p>
<p>If you want to try doing something else than just randomly placing bets and spinning, you can take a look at our roulette strategies. We came up with interesting ways of playing roulette which yield good results in the long run. Of course, they will not make you be a long-term winner on roulette (that’s impossible), but they can be used to gain a good chance to reach a predetermined result.</p>
<p>We also wrote an article about so-called scam roulette strategies like Martingale that are often presented as a surefire way to make money and "beat" the casino. Of course, that’s not true, as you’ll sooner or later lose your entire bankroll if you follow these strategies. Feel free to try them out when playing roulette for fun but stay away from when playing for real money. Read the article linked above to find out why.</p>
