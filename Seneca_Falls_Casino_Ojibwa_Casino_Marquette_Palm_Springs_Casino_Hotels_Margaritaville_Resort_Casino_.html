<p>Chalkline Sports to Rebrand as It Expands into New Verticals</p>
<p>The latest Chalkline Sports rebrand to just “Chalkline” will see the company focus on exploring new opportunities and continue to grow its impressive portfolio of games in the North American market.</p>
<p>Chalkline Sheds “Sports” from Name in Rebranding Move</p>
<p>Chalkline Sports is shedding the “sports” out of its name to reflect the company’s broader focus on gaming products in North America and the United States in particular. As one of the leading providers of freeplay and real money sports betting games through partnerships with prominent US brands, Chalkline is now exploring further growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Chalkline has already redesigned its corporate website to reflect the new, more inclusive direction the company is taking. Chalkline will aim at boosting awareness and engagement among gambling operators as well as media companies, an official press release stated.</p>
<p>Through this rebranding, Chalkline is going to start delivering new products to interested parties, including lotto-style sports games along with fixed odds lottery, jackpot games, more social casino sports offers, virtual currency games, and more.</p>
<p>The company’s flagship product, BettorGames, a platform bringing together 8,000 unique freeplay titles and real money games, is already appealing to at least 5 million people around the world.</p>
<p>Delivering New Products with Same Distinct Quality</p>
<p>Chalkline CEO Daniel Kustelski welcomed the opportunity arguing that personalized and localized freeplay sports games are a key part of the company’s offer but that, similarly, the platform has a lot more to offer.</p>
<p>“The rebrand to Chalkline represents our streamlined focus on becoming the number one B2B provider of freeplay and real money games to operators and media companies in the US market.”</p>
<p>Kustelski reassured that while Chalkline will look into new visual identity opportunities, the company remained the same experienced purveyor of gaming and sports products that millions of people worldwide have come to know.</p>
<p>“This realignment enables Chalkline to better engage potential partners and work with them to deliver games their players love across products that will help them acquire and retain customers,” Kustelski explained.</p>
