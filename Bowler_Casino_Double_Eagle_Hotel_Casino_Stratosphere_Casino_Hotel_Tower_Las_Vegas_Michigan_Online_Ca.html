    <h1>Bowler Casino Double Eagle Hotel Casino Stratosphere Casino Hotel Tower Las Vegas Michigan Online Ca</h1>

<p>BetVictor, one of the longest-standing iGaming and gambling companies in the world, with licenses to operate in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, Germany, Malta, Ontario, and Ireland, has revealed a rebranding move that will see the privately-owned company be known as BVGroup moving forward.</p>
<p>BVGroup will remain to be headquartered in Gibraltar and operate a 650-strong workforce across the globe. At the core of its rebranding, the company has touted its commitment to protecting consumers from gambling-related harm, and further push towards developing innovative technology and products.</p>
<p>The arrival of the new name and identity comes with a new corporate website, BV Group dot com, and the rebranding is aligned with the companyâ€™s commitment to offering advanced B2B technology solutions across the world. The company, though, originally started in the B2C sector, more than 75 years ago, and it has been one of the largest independently held companies and tech innovators in the segment.</p>
<p>BetVictor will still be a recognizable B2C brand on the radar, with the company also focusing on developing fresh technology and services for its partners. Among those are names such as BildBet, talkSPORTBET, Heart Bingo, and many others.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Andreas Meinrad, BVGroup Chief Executive Officer, said that the new identity would help define the group and its efforts more effectively, and highlight the long way that the company has come since it started as a bookmaker some 75 years before.</p>
<p>"While we remain intensely proud of our heritage, our focus is always on the future and how we can continue to innovate and grow to best serve our customers and partners. BVGroup is an exciting development in the progress of the company," Meinrad said.</p>
<p>BVGroup will remain committed to forging meaningful alliances and long-lasting partnerships moving forward, leaning in heavily on its expertise in offering partners cutting-edge and advanced software across the board.</p>
