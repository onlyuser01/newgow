    <h1>Brango Casino Review Fourwinds Casino Casino Slots Free Poker Star Casino Casinos Sacramento Wazdan</h1>

<p>Avento, an iGaming operator in Romania which owns three prominent brands, including Frank, Mr Bit, and its leading website, SlotV, has confirmed that it has teamed up with Wazdan to expand its library of games and the available titles that local players can try.</p>
<p>As a result, the operator and its brands will now host 60 of the supplier’s games, including excellent choices such as Power of Gods: Egypt, Sizzling 777 Deluxeand 9 Coins: 1000 Edition. Other games will include 9 Burning Dragons as well as Wazdan’s signature mechanics and features, Cash Infinity, and Hold the Jackpot.</p>
<p>These features are designed to boost engagement, improve retention, and overall elevate the level of fun and excitement players get from playing. Anastasia Kolmakova, who works as Head of Marketing and PR at Avento, confirmed that the company was very happy to see these new games arrive.</p>
<p>She further added that the Wazdan games have been directly implemented in the operator’s Google Play applications to guarantee them a bigger reach and also drive stronger engagement with local audiences.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Wazdan’s own Head of Account Management, Magdalena Wojdyla, who said that the supplier’s portfolio of games stood out by virtue of its "engagement-boosting mechanics." The titles offered by Wazdan will be a perpetual source of value to Avento and its websites in Romania and beyond.</p>
<p>Wojdyla didn’t miss to mention that her company is focusing on growing its footprint in the Balkans and it plans on adding more games to online casinos in the region as well.</p>
<p>Wazdan has had a string of successes all over the world, not just in the Balkans. The company did grow its footprint significantly in Bulgaria, but it did not stop there. In April, Wazdan became one of the first companies to hurry up and obtain a license from Spelinspektionen in Sweden.</p>
<p>The firm doubled down on its commitment to big regulated markets by signing up a content alliance with 32Red in the United Kingdom and also embarking on a similar content journey with Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino in Ontario in April. Overall, Wazdan has been a true globe-trotter of a supplier, with its games present in dozens of jurisdictions and resonating with players locally all over the world.</p>
