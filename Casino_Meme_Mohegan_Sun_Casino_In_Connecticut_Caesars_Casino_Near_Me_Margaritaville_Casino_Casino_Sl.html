<p>Incubeta will bolster Golden Nugget’s advertising efforts in Michigan by focusing on key aspects of the offer and creating tailored products to drive growth and performance.</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Gets Help from Incubeta to Boost Marketing in MI</p>
<p>Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) has tapped Incubeta to spearhead the iGaming operator’s digital growth in the United States and create a recognizable brand footprint across multiple channels, including YouTube, UAC, Play Store, and Paid Search.</p>
<p>Incubeta will help the brand build up its reputational footprint in Michigan, where both companies have access through licensing from the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB). Golden Nugget offers a comprehensive portfolio of products, including iCasino and sports gambling options accessible through the brand’s dedicated mobile app. Golden Nugget is similarly represented in New Jersey, where it has been scaling up its operations.</p>
<p>Incubeta is a trusted and verified Google Marketing Platform Partner, giving it a strong foothold in the highly competitive advertising space for iGaming businesses. The company has the benefit of working closely with Google’s real money gaming team to create and execute campaigns that achieve their stated goals and drive awareness as well as possible traffic for brands.</p>
<p>Driving Growth and Performance in iCasino and Online Betting Is Priority</p>
<p>Ultimately, GNOG is hoping to boost its performance and achieve better overall growth. The news about Incubeta joining GNOG’s marketing efforts was welcomed by Golden Nugget director digital marketing Samir Banerjee who said that the company’s vast experience in the sports gambling and iCasino ecosystem allows it to understand the operator’s unique requirements.</p>
<p>“As the pandemic continues to restrict people’s movements, our online strategy will be vital to our growth, which is why we’re working with the best in the business,” Banerjee added.</p>
<p>Incubeta head of business development Charlie said that the company was thrilled to explore this opportunity with Golden Nugget, citing the company’s staying power in the global iGaming and betting scene.</p>
<p>He continued by adding that Incubeta’s own understanding of the industry would help enhance GNOG’s existing strategy and drive revenue as well as growth. Golden Nugget has been doing well so far as its online business has been concerned. The company similarly secured market access in the New York market through a partnership with Tioga Downs, although there is still a lot of uncertainty as to which way the mobile betting market in the Empire State is going</p>
