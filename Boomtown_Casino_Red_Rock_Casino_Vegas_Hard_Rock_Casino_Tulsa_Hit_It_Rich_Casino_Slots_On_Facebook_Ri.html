    <h1>Boomtown Casino Red Rock Casino Vegas Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Hit It Rich Casino Slots On Facebook Ri</h1>

<p>Hello to the gentleman from the Guru CASINO and the gentleman from the Vulkan Casino. From what I remember, it was a code for 200% of the deposit. I received the code from a Facebook group. It was written that the CODE was valid. I tried to redeem the BONUS but it didn't work. I was very angry. because I lost a big deposit. I was thinking for a long time whether I should play again because I had no luck. I made a deposit for real money because I didn't know any other bonus code. I REMEMBER THAT WITH A BIT OF LUCK I MANAGED TO WIN A COUPLE OF BETS BECAUSE THE FATE WAS REVERSED FOR A MOMENT. In the game with a bonus and with the real balance I lost all the money, I can't show the betting history because I don't have access to the account, I'M NOT A GAMBLER AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF THE MAN FROM VULKLAN CASINO: SET OFF BONUS ROUNDS IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY ::;is such a thing possible? Never in my life I haven't heard of such a thing, In my faceebok group, everyone brags about the bonus wagering, I really have no idea how a game like this is related'</p>
<p>At the beginning, the lady from the Vulkan support pointed out in the chat that I had broken the regulations by playing with bets above 5 euros and doubling them with bonus funds, the lady from the support emphasized the words that "this is why my accounts with a balance are taken away" AND HERE THE MAN FROM VULKAN STILL SAYS THAT FOR GAMES. BONUS.</p>
<p>Please look at the screenshot. When I asked for proof, the lady wrote that I would not show proof of breaking the regulations AND SHE WROTE THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS, VULKAN MAY CLOSE THE PLAYER'S ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME. TAKE THE BALANCE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PROVIDING PROOF, PLEASE SEE THE SCREEN SHOT.</p>
<p>AND NOW THE MAN FROM VULKAN CASINO CHANGES THE OBJECTION BY DESCRIBING SOME DEPOSITION OF BONUS ROUNDS? I don't know much about the bonus regulations, but I'd like to take this opportunity to ask: Is there any other way to break the bonus rules? So far, I've learned two ways... playing with bonus funds. j 5 euros and putting aside some rounds of the game,,,AND THE MAN FROM THE CASINO WANTS ME TO GIVE BACK 3,000 EURO???WHAT IS THIS PENALTY?I lost a deposit of about 900 euros... Vulkan casino took my balance with withdrawal of about 2,000 euros and they still want the next 3,000 euros????I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK READING ALL THIS..If I had known that I would have such problems at the Vulkan CASINO because of the winnings.I would never have made a deposit.When I saw the Vulkan range.I thought to myself, what a nice casino? ??And now it turns out that it's not so cool. My Facebook group has about 20,000 people. Half of them are very surprised by this attitude of the Vulkan casino. I can't even explain to them exactly how I broke the rules because it didn't occur to me. So many of my words and translations, I am asking for help because I still do not believe that all this happened.</p>
