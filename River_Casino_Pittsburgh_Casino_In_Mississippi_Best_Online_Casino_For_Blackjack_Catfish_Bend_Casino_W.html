<p>The New Hampshire Lottery, the entity responsible for managing the state’s sports betting industry, released its July financial report. The NH sportsbooks experienced steady year-to-year growth, but the industry entered its seasonal summer slump, slowing down compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>The State Recorded Double-Digit Yearly Growth</p>
<p>According to July’s financial results, the New Hampshire sports betting industry recorded a handle of $42.65 million, a 16.4% increase compared to the same period in 2021. These results continue the state’s stable yearly growth since it opened its regulated market in December 2019.</p>
<p>Despite positive year-to-year growth, July’s sports betting handle dropped considerably compared to the previous month. In June this year, New Hampshire sportsbooks made $53.57 million, marking a stark 20.3% monthly drop. However, the summer months usually experience a cooldown in betting activity due to the slow seasonal sportsbook calendar.</p>
<p>Revenue Stayed Strong despite the Lower Handle</p>
<p>The state’s online sector was responsible for most of the betting handle. Land-based sportsbooks made $9.55 million, while the remaining $33.11 million were spent at online operator DraftKings. The sports betting giant made a groundbreaking deal with the New Hampshire Lottery in November 2019, securing exclusive rights to the state’s online betting market. As a result, the operator contributed $1.77 million in taxes, while retail sportsbooks paid a combined $345,695.</p>
<p>Monthly revenue mostly stayed in line with the betting handle, rising 45.2% ahead of July 2021 at $4.48 million. While profits still failed to match June’s results, the drop was only 6.3% lower despite the more substantial difference in handle.</p>
<p>The Monthly Decline Mirrors Other States</p>
<p>Despite the short-term slowdown, the double-digit yearly growth indicates that New Hampshire’s sports betting market is still strong regardless of the negative global financial factors.</p>
<p>Other US states appear to be following a similar trajectory. Michigan also recently released financial results for its gambling market. Like New Hampshire, the Great Lake State recorded a seasonal dip in sports betting handle, which dropped by 23% to its lowest since last summer. However, Michigan’s sportsbooks similarly enjoyed a stable year-to-year increase.</p>
<p>Tennessee and Indiana’s July reports support the trend, but Mississippi marks an exception. The Magnolia State’s sports betting handle went down 40.4% compared to last July and 27.1% compared to June. Maryland also recorded a monthly decline, but since the state’s legal sports betting market launched last December, it is impossible to measure yearly results.</p>
<p>Despite the summer slowdown, sportsbook operators across the USA can look forward to a substantial boost in the last quarter as the 2022 FIFA World Cup will kick off in November, heralding many new opportunities.</p>
