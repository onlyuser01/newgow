    <h1>Best Casino In Atlantic City Foxwoods Online Casino Casino Locations Hotels Near Pechanga Resort Cas</h1>

<p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>Thank you for your swift reply and for the acceptance of the complaint.</p>
<p>To answer your questions, here are the following:</p>
<p>Could you please advise since when exactly is the verification process ongoing?</p>
<p>I submitted my application of withdrawal on Monday, 10/04/23. (In comparison to the ones i've read on the thread, this does not compare to the weeks that many had to go through).</p>
<p>Which documents have been already approved and which ones not?</p>
<p>They asked for the following on Tuesday, 11/04/23 @ 14:08 -</p>
<p>Color picture of front/back ID. Color picture of a utility bill. Bank statements containing bank details, customer details, acc details and date of issue. (Here they are asking for the 2 cards I used to deposit money, a physical Revolut card and a Virtual card. Color pictures of the front/back of the 2 cards that I used with the first 6 and last 4 digits visible (rest can be covered).</p>
<p>I replied on the same day Tuesday, 11/04/23 @ 20:19 with the following -</p>
<p>Picture of my drivers license (front/back). Proof of address. Picture of my first card which is a physical Revolut card (front/back - this becomes an issue later on because I submitted a picture with only the last 4 digits shown and I covered the first 6 digits of the card). Picture of my second card but this was a virtual card so I sent screenshots of it with the card number (this again becomes an issue as I did the same thing with the first card regarding the card number and when I took a screenshot of this, I cropped out the transaction list below the card - I hope you're familiar with Revolut). A Revolut bank statement for the month of March.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 12/04/23 @ 10:36 I followed up with an email expressing my concerns regarding their withdrawal system as I have read certain reviews that made me feel unsafe about their website. I also asked if there was a phone number I can reach, another email address or a way in which I can track the process to make me feel at ease.</p>
<p>The same day @10:57 , they replied about my virtual card. They asked for a card statement or a similar document issued by the bank, showing your name and the last four digits of the card as well as the expiry date.</p>
<p>The same day @11:33 , I replied and sent an April Revolut statement which fully shows the deposits I have made to the casino on BOTH cards.</p>
<p>The same day @12:45 I followed up again with an email to say that I have submitted the necessary information, and I followed up on my question of - is there a number I can reach, etc etc. and again I expressed my concern as to how it is difficult for me to understand why they can't reply an update.</p>
<p>The same day @17:07 I followed up again on the withdrawal with an email.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 13/04/2023 @ 14:14 I resent my April Revolut statement along with the picture of my virtual card just to ask for a follow up.</p>
<p>The same day @20:13 , they finally replied and mentioned that the pictures I forwarded wasn't good enough. It must not be 'cropped'. So they asked again for the screenshot with the virtual card and only replied to my concerns with the words - 'Also, note that your filed will be forwarded for revision only after we receive all the above-mentioned items'. This is where I start to get REALLY worried, and I do hope you understand why. But from what i've seen, I should be happy that i'm even getting a reply right?</p>
<p>The same day @20:32, I sent a full screenshot of my virtual card as it appears on my revolut card (along with the transaction list).</p>
<p>On Friday, 14/04/2023, @11:35 they replied with 'Unfortunately your documents cannot be forwarded as they JUST saw that the first six digits on the back side of my physical Revolut card was covered and are asking for a picture of it not being covered. They also requested a selfie of my Driver's license.</p>
<p>The same day @12:13 I sent a picture of my physical Revolut card with the requested digits shown, along with a selfie of my driver's license AND I also sent a screenshot of my virtual card showing the first six numbers of the number as per instruction (so that they don't ask for it in the future knowing now that I have made a mistake on it).</p>
<p>When was the last time you spoke to the casino and what was it about?</p>
<p>Friday, 14/04/2023 @12:13.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, due to my mistake which I fully understand, the process has prolonged. But from these timestamps, you can see there is a pattern. (Again, I understand, KYC, lack of employee, etc etc) they only reply once a day no matter how fast you reply back after receiving their email. So far they haven't replied since and I kind of felt that they wouldn't since it was the weekend, but as of writing this, they still haven't replied so I am genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>Just reinforcing on everyone, take it from someone who is going through it, please don't register .</p>
<p>It just makes me wonder, if I sent the info correctly, would it be the same?</p>
<p>But from what i've read, I doubt it.</p>
