<p>Bet365 Poker is one of the namesake betting company’s newest ventures. As the poker vertical continues to gather momentum, bet365 has quickly been established as one of the market leaders in the UK. Today, you can experience a variety of excellent games, benefiting from state-of-the-art software, hand racking, and various versions of the games. Find out more in our dedicated Bet365 Poker review below.</p>
<p>Bet365 Overview and Facts</p>
<p>Even though bet365 poker may be advertised as a bit of a novelty, it’s actually been around for a good while now. The poker vertical launched in 2004, making it one of the most important assets for the company, and upgrading the existing casino, sports, and horse racing betting verticals.</p>
<p>From thereon in, the brand has been building upon its success. Bet365 started on the Microgaming Network but switched to the iPoker network owned by Playtech in 2007. The website has been known for quite a few innovative twists. They were among the first to succeed in reviving the Rush Poker format that was available on the Full Tilt website, with bet365’s Sprint Poker.</p>
<p>Later on, PokerStars, a well-known poker rival, would go on to launch their own version of the game, known as Zoom Poker. Overall, bet365 is making ripples in the poker world, but more work remains to be done to catch up to the rest of the poker card rooms available in the United Kingdom and the world.</p>

<p>Bet365 poker provides you with an excellent and clear-cut variety of bonuses. The starting bonus is set at £365 and is distributed as a £360 cash bonus and a £5 no deposit bonus for simply registering and picking up your nickname to participate.</p>
