<p>Thank you for your reply xMonarch. I am sorry, but we are not able to help you with this case. I checked the casino's T&amp;Cs, which clearly says that creating more than one account per person is prohibited:</p>
<p>"You warrant not to create any additional accounts from the same electronic device, household, IP address, natural person, or legal identity without informing the Roobet support team immediately. Multiple accounts made in order to trick, manipulate or trick the companyâ€™s system in any way are not allowed and will be terminated without warning. All Roobidos in a terminated account will be lost. All accounts made to circumvent the companies KYC and AML checks and verifications will be reported to the authorities. Further information regarding the KYC and AML checks and verification can be found in our KYC-AML Policy. You warrant to report any additional account created by yourself or a close relative sharing an electronic device, household, IP address, or identity card without delay to the Roobet Support and fully verify it according to the KYC-AML policy."</p>
<p>I apologize, but for us, T&amp;Cs clearly prevail in situations like this and we cannot go against them. Players should never create more than one account per casino. Not to mention that live chat support can make a mistake too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are rejecting this complaint as unjustified. Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
