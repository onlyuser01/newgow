    <h1>Divi Carina Bay Resort Casino Casino Italy Montreal Casino Route 66 Hotel And Casino Red Dog Casino</h1>

<p>Century Casinos, a casino entertainment company operating casino resorts and racetracks in the US and Canada announced today a new partnership with BetMakers Technology Group that will see racing content distribution and fixed odds wagering.</p>
<p>Racing Content and Fixed Odds Wagering</p>
<p>Century Casinos’ Canadian subsidiaries Century Downs Racetrack and Casino (CDR) and Century Mile Racetrack and Casino (CMR) operating racetracks in Canada signed a racing content distribution agreement with BetMakers’ Global Racing Network that will also see two of the racetracks’ thoroughbred and standardbred horse races facilitate fixed odds wagering.</p>
<p>The agreement that commences February 26, 2022 at CDR’s 2022 Meet will allow licensed sports betting operators worldwide, including on markets in which Century Casinos has no access yet like Australia and Asia, to offer racing content from both Century Casinos’ Canadian racetracks for betting purposes.</p>
<p>The Global Racing Network partnership will expand the global reach of Century Casinos’ racetracks that have already positioned as premier destinations for horse racing in Canada, and will bring closer Century Casinos’ racing product to new markets and racing enthusiasts all over the world.</p>
<p>Busy First Months of the Year</p>
<p>The new partnership with Century Casinos is the second major Canadian development for Australian-based BetMakers Technology Group following an agreement with CrossBet which granted the tech provider access to markets in Ontario.</p>
<p>BetMakers agreed to supply its proprietary sports betting platform and power operations of the gaming brand across Canada’s most densely populated province ahead of the province’s official launch in April.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, Century Casinos has been active in the M&amp;A space, signing definitive agreements to sell one property in Canada and acquire another in the US.</p>
<p>In January, the casino entertainment company announced its Canadian subsidiary in Alberta, Century Resorts Alberta, agreed to sell its property in Calgary – the building and the land of the property – to Rowanwood Financial Properties Ltd for $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The deal for the casino known as Silver Dollar Casino before Century Casinos acquired it in 2010 is expected to close within 30 days of the announcement.</p>
<p>Just days ago, Century Casinos moved to enter into the gaming market in Reno, Nevada, by signing a definitive agreement to purchase the Nugget Casino Resort from Marnell Gaming by acquiring the operating company Nugget Sparks LLC in full, as well as 50% of the company owning the land of the property, Smooth Bourbon LLC, for $195 million.</p>
<p>Century Casinos will also have an option executable within the next five years to acquire the remaining half of the land of the casino property for $105 million plus 2% interest per annum.</p>
