    <h1>Casinos In Ct Thunder Valley Casino Resort Hard Rock Casinos Winner Casino Myrtle Beach Casinos UFC</h1>

<p>This is notably the first time Betclic has had the opportunity to work with a global organization</p>
<p>Betclic, a French iGaming and sports betting company, has been selected as the official betting partner of the UFC in France, Portugal and Poland. As a result, the operator will play an important role in supporting the upcoming Fight Night Paris event.</p>
<p>Fight Night Paris will be one of the biggest combat sports events in the country since the UFC was not legal in France until very recently. With Roxana Maracineanu, France’s Minister of Sport, finally lifting the ban, the UFC is once again able to engage French fans with exciting events.</p>
<p>The UFC Fight Night Paris is scheduled for September 2 and will feature a heavyweight fight between the Parisian Ciryl Gane and the Moldovan athlete Serghei “Polar Bear” Spivac.</p>
<p>Under the agreement between the league and Betclic, the operator will serve as the presenting partner of the event. As a result, the gaming company will have a presence inside the Accor Arena and across UFC’s social media accounts.</p>
<p>This is notably the first time Betclic has had the opportunity to work with a global organization, making the current partnership a very important milestone for the company.</p>
<p>Betclic Is Honored to Be the First UFC Partner In Its Target Markets</p>
<p>Nicholas Smith, vice president of global partnerships at the UFC, noted that France is a very important market to his team. He explained that his company had to put in a lot of hard work to get mixed martial arts recognized in France. Now that it has finally succeeded, the league seeks to create more meaningful and impactful partnerships with local companies.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to working alongside Betclic to enhance our fans’ online gambling experience and bring some exciting activations to our upcoming event in Paris. Nicholas Smith, VP of global partnerships, UFC</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nicolas Béraud, Betclic’s managing director, said that his team is excited to be the first UFC partner in France, Portugal and Poland. Béraud praised the UFC for developing mixed martial arts and said that his team is excited about promoting emerging sports.</p>
<p>With this partnership, we will offer them a new experience with increased interactivity during UFC events and some surprises for UFC Fight Night Paris on September 2! Nicolas Béraud, MD, Betclic</p>
<p>The first UFC event since the legalization of the UFC in France was a match between Ciryl Gane and Tai Tuivasa. Ontario, meanwhile, is a region that legalized UFC betting earlier this year.</p>
