<p>Rocket Fellas Inc. review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Rocket Fellas Inc. is one of those slots that seems to have been designed by a committee. The title is a pun on the Rockefeller family name – the Rockefellers being one of the richest families in America – while the characters are mining dwarves out of Tolkein but working in a California Gold Rush mine to a soundtrack of 1970s funk. Make of all this, what you can, dear player.</p>
<p>All this mishmash of thematic parts is centred around the rocket mechanic, which does not seem to be best suited to the tight undergrounds spaces of an old fashioned mineshaft. But somehow Rocket Fellas Inc. just about holds together as a slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A large part of what makes this slot work is the design elements. The style is deliberately cartoonish with brightly coloured precious stones and still more brightly coloured beards on the various dwarves.</p>
<p>The animations are bombastic and, in the case of the rockets, explosive. They match well with the sound effects and reel noises.</p>
<p>Even the strange funk track doesn’t feel completely out of place in this brightly coloured world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game of Rocket Fellas Inc. is played on a five reel, four row slot. Although the bonus game is just a free spin feature, the base game remains interesting thanks to the variety provided by several game features. These are triggered by the various special symbols described in detail below.</p>
<p>The spicey gameplay combines with the light hearted tone to keep the player interested.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol, the Barrel symbol, or the Rocket Symbol.</p>
<p>In the base game, the Rocket symbol can appear on the left hand reel and turns into a Wild symbol. If there is a barrel on the same row as the Rocket symbol, the Rocket will also transform the barrel into a Wild along with any other barrel symbols that are directly connected to it by other barrels both vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>If a Barrel symbol appears without a Rocket, it can pay out like any other symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels will trigger the Bonus game. The player receives ten free spins for three Scatters and five additional free spins for each additional Scatter.</p>
<p>During the Bonus game, the Scatter can add spins to your total. Hitting two Scatters in one spin will add three spins to the player’s total, while hitting more than two will add the same number of spins as in the base game.</p>
<p>An additional twist during the Bonus game is that any Barrel on the same row as a rocket will be turned into a Sticky Wild and will remain in place until the end of the Bonus game.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Rocket Fellas Inc. has a return to player of 96.10%. This is close to our yardstick for average of roughly 96% and so gives the game a pass mark.</p>
<p>One of the Rocket Fellas Inc.’s major sources of appeal is its high volatility, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no system for reducing the number of win lines played from the standard setting of thirty. This limits the player’s control over how volatile the game is.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Rocket Fellas Inc. is a bizarre slot in many ways, but under its odd surface lies a solid slot machine with all the fundamentals in place and a few additional twists.</p>
<p>The Rocket symbol adds a fun mechanic that is both visually stimulating and excellent for keeping the game interesting in the slow patches created by the high volatility.</p>
<p>The decent return to player is coupled with a high volatility which should appeal to the strategists in our readership.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this slot heartily.</p>
