<p>FlightScope Services, a data collection, audio-visual production, and tracking technology specialist in golf and tennis, has been acquired by IMG ARENA, a leading sports betting service and content hub. IMG ARENA will use FlightScope Services’ software to provide federations and rights holders with additional goods and services.</p>
<p>FlightScope Integration into IMG ARENA Offering</p>
<p>FlightScope Services, based in Gliwice, Poland, will be completely integrated into the IMG ARENA offering under the continued supervision of Jacek Gronek and Wojtek Szumilas. They will join IMG ARENA along with roughly 160 employees.</p>
<p>Gronek joins the IMG ARENA team as VP Rightsholder Services. Szumilas is now the head of technology.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA will devote considerable resources and funds to bring FlightScope Services’ cutting-edge technology to other sports in the company’s portfolio, including football, basketball, and volleyball, as well as major US sports.</p>
<p>Under the latest IMG ARENA Rightsholder Solutions pillar, the company will also use FlightScope Services’ technology to offer additional products and services to federations and rightsholders.</p>
<p>Managing director Freddie Longe, IMG ARENA, said: “This is a very exciting acquisition for IMG ARENA. The integration of FlightScope Services technology is a fundamental part of our growth strategy and provides the foundation for the launch of our new Rightsholder Solutions.”</p>
<p>Building and Improving on Existing Tech</p>
<p>He further added that this new pillar would strengthen its services to rightsholders, including content development, automated and manual, content management, and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA will be able to expand its fan interaction creativity through the advancement of data and audio-visual assets and include additional content and business possibilities for federations and rights holders across the company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Gronek added that FlightScope Services and IMG ARENA merger is a natural fit, based on product, customer base, and, most importantly, culture and vision. It will allow IMG ARENA to extend its portfolio of best-in-class services and technology across multiple sports by leveraging the company’s expertise, strengths, and resources.</p>
<p>Since 2013, IMG ARENA has partnered extensively with FlightScope Services.</p>
<p>IMG ARENA uses a ground-breaking data collection method built by the two companies to monitor and mark the ball within millimeters of its location on the course to record data from every shot played on the European Tour</p>
<p>The cutting-edge live scoring capture system has provided a wealth of previously unavailable data and powering a variety of new live betting markets.</p>
<p>BetMGM Integrated Golf Event Centre</p>
<p>Another IMG ARENA endeavor came in March when the company signed an agreement with BetMGM. The deal will see the unprecedented for customers sports betting solution Golf Event Centre be used by BetMGM.</p>
<p>Golf Event Centre, a front-end solution developed in partnership with the world’s leading golf tours, aims to enhance the golf betting experience by enabling in-play wagering, offering access to quick and detailed data and markets, live streaming, and immersive course visualizations, and is accessible to sportsbook operators worldwide.</p>
