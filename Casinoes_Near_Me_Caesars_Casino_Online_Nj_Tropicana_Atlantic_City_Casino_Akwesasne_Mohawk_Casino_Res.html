    <h1>Casinoes Near Me Caesars Casino Online Nj Tropicana Atlantic City Casino Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Res</h1>

<p>Dear Heiko1234,</p>
<p>We would like to shed light on your case.</p>
<p>On 25th November 2021 your created an account in our casino using your email wue<strong>*</strong>*yahoo.de</p>
<p>After using our services, you many times requested account closure and account opening (with taking all responsibilities for opening).</p>
<p>On 20th January, we received from you letter:</p>
<p>"It is enough account to close permanently without the right to return moreover my 0.07 cents would have been back my money if it wasn't a fault of fraud and I will contact the competent authority and casino guru I wish you go broke"</p>
<p>Our support team closed your account according to your request.</p>
<p>On 30th March, you created another account, using different email address: luca24022013@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Your actions are a straight violation of our rules:</p>
<p>2.8. When creating an account, your personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, such as name, email address, etc. You're not allowed to create multiple accounts: only 1 account per person. You're not allowed to create an account for any other person, family member, address (mail or IP), email, or device. Any other accounts besides your main RollingSlots account are considered duplicates. The Casino reserves the right to block multiple accounts without notice.</p>
<p>If we decide to delete a duplicate account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all bonuses, free spins, and winnings that you received by using this account will be canceled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Company has the right to confiscate deposits that were made with a duplicate account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We truly understand your frustration, regarding this situation, but we are not responsibly for your actions.</p>
<p>Summarize all this:</p>
<p>You consciously violated our established rules by creating a duplicate account. Thus, refund of deposit, made by duplicate account cannot be refunded.</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rolling Slots Casino Representative.</p>
