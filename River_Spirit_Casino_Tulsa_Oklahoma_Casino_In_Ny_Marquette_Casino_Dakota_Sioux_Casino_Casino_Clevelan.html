<p>RushBet, the sports betting and IGaming brand for Rush Street Interactive,is getting a powerful content boost from Light &amp; Wonder, which will be deploying its OpenGaming platform to ensure that players in the regulated Mexican market have to access to award-winning and innovative titles.</p>
<p>RushBet, which launched in Mexico in June, has been increasing its footprint in the iGaming market and looking elsewhere towards broader expansion in Latin America. This ambition coincides with Light &amp; Wonder’s stated goals to position itself firmly with iGaming entities in South America, among others.</p>
<p>The new partnership between RushBet and Light &amp; Wonder will see the latter deploy games by several studios, including Lightning Box (Dragon Palace), Big Time Gaming (Bonanza Megaways) and ReelPlay (Hypernova Megaways). The company will also have its own Marvellous Mouse and 88 Fortunes made available to local players in Mexico.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Commercial Director for the Latin American market, Tatiana García Barrenechea, welcomed this opportunity and said that the company was very keen on expanding its footprint in the region. She did not miss to mention what some of the key strengths of Light &amp; Wonder’s product offering are and why they are important to regional partners.</p>
<p>"We believe that our localized offering, including games heavily influenced by trends in the land-based market, will prove popular with players and significantly further the goals of both parties," Barrenechea said.</p>
<p>The news about this opportunity was similarly welcomed by Rush Street Interactive’s chief executive, Richard Schwartz, who has been one of the masterminds behind the company’s expansion in the Latin American markets. He noted that RushBet and the iGaming products and platforms launched by the company in the United States, Mexico, and Colombia, have all enjoyed success and interest on the part of consumers.</p>
<p>With that said, RushBet is very interested to continue and build up on its offer and what it brings to consumers. Light &amp; Wonder is a unique partner to achieve this goal, Schwartz said, as he touted the company’s global reach and noted that its own focus on Latin America makes for a great partner in the region.</p>
<p>The Mexican entry for RushBet was negotiated as part of a deal with Grupo Multimedios as previously reported. RSI has naturally managed to push its footprint elsewhere in North America, breaking ground in Ontario as well.</p>
