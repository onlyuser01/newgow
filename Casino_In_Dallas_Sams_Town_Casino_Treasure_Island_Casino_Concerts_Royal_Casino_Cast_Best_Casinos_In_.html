<p>Push Gaming, an established B2B gaming supplier, continues to expand quickly in the exciting Dutch iGaming market with the company forging a new alliance with respected local operator 711. The pair will now seek to provide local players with an extensive variety lifted directly from Push Gaming’s library and incorporated into 711’s platform, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>711 will now provide local players with Dino P.D. and Giga Jar, among many other excellent games by Push Gaming, which has been making its local presence felt.</p>
<p>The supplier is entering this new partnership with a lot of excitement and trepidation as it allows it to build upon its already established content agreement with BetCity, and further strengthen its presence in one of Europe’s most important iGaming markets.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Push Gaming Director of New Business and Markets Fiona Hickey said that she was pleased to see the company grow and expand in the Netherlands. She added:</p>
<p>This latest partnership is with another key player in the Dutch market and in 711 we have an operator that is well established, offering another significant segment of players that can begin to enjoy our titles.</p>
<p>711 Chief Operating Officer Gilles De Backer was similarly pleased to see Push Gaming introduce its titles to the platform. De Backer spoke highly of the high-quality content Push Gaming was able to bring and the significant impact the company would have on engagement.</p>
<p>The CCO hailed Push Gaming and its hit titles among which Jammin Jars, Razor Shark and Big Bamboo which have already been established as enjoyable and worthwhile titles to try. Recently, Push Gaming announced a similar content alliance with Kindred Group which was again focused on expanding the supplier’s content footprint in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Push Gaming also signed deals to work and provide content to casino operators in Belgium, including Circus and 777.be. The supplier also made an entry into the Italian market.</p>
