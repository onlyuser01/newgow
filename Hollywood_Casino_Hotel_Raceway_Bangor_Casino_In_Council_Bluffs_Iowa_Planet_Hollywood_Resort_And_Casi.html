    <h1>Hollywood Casino Hotel Raceway Bangor Casino In Council Bluffs Iowa Planet Hollywood Resort And Casi</h1>

<p>The 31-year-old athlete revealed that he initially committed to broadcasting assignments, only to be later excluded by Bet365 due to the betting company's concerns about his outspoken position on gambling addiction</p>
<p>Betting giant Bet365 has decided to part ways with former footballer Steven Caulker as a pundit for an online video series it sponsors. The decision came in light of Caulker’s public statements about gambling, raising concerns within the company.</p>
<p>Former QPR Defender Caulker Excluded by Bet365 for Gambling Addiction Advocacy</p>
<p>Caulker, a seasoned centre-back with a history at QPR and Tottenham, recently found himself without a club after leaving Wigan Athletic following a stint in Turkey, The Guardian reported. The 31-year-old athlete disclosed that he had initially signed up for broadcasting work but was subsequently dropped by Bet365 due to the betting company’s apprehension about his outspoken stance on gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The revelation surfaced through The Big Step, an organization advocating for the end of gambling sponsorship and advertising in football. Caulker had previously shared his personal struggles with gambling, alcohol, and depression in a candid interview with The Guardian back in 2017.</p>
<p>The Big Step and other anti-gambling campaigners in the UK have criticized the Premier League’s attempt to compromise with the government by voluntarily giving up front-of-shirt gambling sponsorships, stating that the proposed move does not address more visible hoarding sponsorships, which are considered more problematic.</p>
<p>Bet365 Explains Decision to Drop Caulker from Video Series</p>
<p>Bet365 addressed the situation in a statement, clarifying that Caulker had applied to be a guest on a video series exclusively sponsored by the company. The series is published on an online video platform, not traditional television, through one of Bet365’s sports publishing partners. During the approval process, the company became aware of Caulker’s candid discussions about his negative experiences with gambling.</p>
<p>Bet365 conveyed in their official response that they appreciated Mr. Caulker’s commendable efforts in raising awareness about problem gambling. However, as a betting company, they considered it inappropriate for him to appear on a Bet365-sponsored series of that nature. The company expressed regret over any miscommunication and emphasized that their position had been inaccurately conveyed to Caulker by their media partner. The specific online video platform for which Caulker was commissioned remains undisclosed.</p>
<p>Caulker, who made headlines by scoring on his England debut in a friendly against Sweden in 2012, underwent a notable career shift in 2021 when he transferred to Sierra Leone, where he currently serves as the captain. Despite his athletic achievements, Caulker’s off-field challenges have brought him into the spotlight, sparking discussions not only about the struggles athletes face but also the delicate relationship between sports and the gambling industry.</p>
