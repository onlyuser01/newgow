<p>Red Rake Gaming has just signed a deal with Rivalo, boosting its exposure on the Colombian market.</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming Wants to Boost LatAm Online Gaming Community</p>
<p>Spanish and Maltese-based provider of casino games Red Rake Gaming has teamed with Colombian operator Rivalo as part of a fresh content deal designed to enhance the developer’s exposure on the Latin America market.</p>
<p>The partnership will allow Rivalo to grow its offer with a string of player-favorite games by Red Rake, including Million 777, The Asp of Cleopatra, Secrets of the Temple, and others.</p>
<p>Commenting on the link-up between the companies, Red Rake Malta’s managing director, Nick Barr, said that the company was excited to team up with Rivalo and thanked the operator for the trust it placed in Red Rake Gaming.</p>
<p>Owing to the partnership, Barr expects both companies to continue growing in Colombia, a market that has already secured entries from the likes of Evolution Gaming and Pragmatic Play to name a few.</p>
<p>Barr added that Red Rake remained dedicated to the development of bespoke games that have already been well-received in Latin America, including slots and video bingos.</p>
<p>In light of this past success, Red Rake is confident that the fresh alliance will serve as another stepping stone for the company in the market, Barr concluded.</p>
<p>Colombia Sees Strong Bidders Join iGaming Market</p>
<p>Rivalo’s country manager, Alvaro Mosquera, shared the company’s enthusiasm to be strengthening its own portfolio with an accomplished developer as Red Rake. Thanks to the company’s games, Mosquera explained, Rivalo will be able to deliver a product that offers users “great value, performance and entertainment.”</p>
<p>Mosquera confirmed that Rivalo will continue to seek and expand its offering for the Colombian market and treating users to quality products.</p>
<p>Red Rake’s Global Push Continues</p>
<p>Recently, Red Rake Gaming also enhanced its global presence by teaming up with the independent operator Moosh.pt. Since September 8, Portuguese consumers have been able to enjoy top-performing games by the provider. This agreement precedes the November agreement signed with BetVictor.</p>
<p>In a similar move, Red Rake has expanded its clout by signing a partnership with Betway, a leading provider of sports betting and gaming products, again in Portugal.</p>
<p>Another essential partnership was struck with 888, with Red Rake products now rolling out across the operator’s casino brand in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>An even more important partnership for the company proved the alliance between Red Rake and GVC, which recently rebranded as Entain. As a result, Entain now has full access to the entire Red Rake’s iGaming portfolio.</p>
<p>As demand for online casino content continues to grow, Red Rake Gaming is positioning itself quickly and finding its place in various markets, and reaching out to new global audiences in Latin America and beyond.</p>
