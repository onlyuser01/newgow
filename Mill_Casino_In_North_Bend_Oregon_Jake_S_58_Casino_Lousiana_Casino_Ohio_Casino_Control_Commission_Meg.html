<p>Oklahoma-based premier gaming entertainment venue Choctaw Casinos &amp; Resorts has recently sealed the deal for a four-year partnership with Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) Tour Champions. As part of the deal, the Indian casino operator will become the presenting sponsor of the ClubCorp Classic event that will reunite the most prestigious PGA Tour Champions with celebrities in the world of entertainment and sports. The event will also host the first-ever amateur match between the Club’s members, professional sportsmen, and stars.</p>
<p>Choctaw, the Ideal Growth Partner for the PGA Tour Champions Event</p>
<p>Choctaw Casinos &amp; Resorts has been appointed the presenting sponsor of the yearly PGA Tour Champions event that will take place between April 19 and April 24 in Texas thanks to a plethora of reasons. Primarily, the Indian casino operator that is owned by the Choctaw Nation has been granted the privilege of sponsoring the ClubCorp Classic event thanks to its status as a top-tier entertainment venue. Counting over 200,000 tribal members and 10,000 employees, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is the third biggest Indian Nation in the US. Last August, Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort in Durant expanded its gambling and resort venues facilities, opening a $600-million property.</p>
<p>The operator that is currently responsible for managing eight tribal casinos, resort, and hotel properties spread across Oklahoma has also been selected to bring a number of on-site and off-site advertising activities to the event, along with plenty of fan enhancements. Choctaw will also dedicate its efforts to doing charity work that would support local organizations.</p>
<p>ClubCorp’ CEO David Pillsbury highlighted the fact that Choctaw’s crucial role in the regional entertainment scene makes them the best partner for launching and growing the event that promises to be a spectacular one in 2022. Thanks to the operator’s top-tier hospitality, dedication, and local charity and community work aimed at creating new roads and jobs, promoting education, and offering emergency services, the Club has chosen to sponsor the tournament. The event will primarily benefit the non-profit Momentous Institute in Texas. The institute offers support in building and repairing the emotional as well as the social health of the people who require its services.</p>
<p>78 Veteran Pro Golfers &amp; 50 Celebs at the ClubCorp Classic Event</p>
<p>The Las Colinas Country Club will be hosting the 2022 inaugural event that will reunite 78 veteran professional golf players and 50 celebrities from the entertainment and sports industries. Confirmed participant names include stand-up comedian Daniel “Larry the Cable Guy” Lawrence Whitney, MLB All-Star pitcher Roger Clemens, Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, 12-year MLB standout Kevin Millar, and musician and former gold pro player Colt Ford. The PGA Tour Champions pros will play 54 stroke play holes for a whopping $2 million, while the celebs will compete in a separate $500,000 event using an altered Stableford format for keeping score.</p>
<p>Choctaw Nation’s Senior Executive Officer Janie Dillard expressed his excitement regarding the partnership with PGA Tour Champions and the ClubCorp Classic, acknowledging the shared interest, respect, entertainment, and innovation in both organizations.</p>
