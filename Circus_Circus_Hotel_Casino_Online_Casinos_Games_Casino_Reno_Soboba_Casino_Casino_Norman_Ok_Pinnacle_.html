<p>The Pinnacle Cup is back once again with yet a new installment in the acclaimed series due to get underway on August 1, 2023</p>
<p>The fifth edition of the event is going to reunite a number of prominent teams from the world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, including Heroic, Astralis, and Fnatic. Those are some of the top-performing teams according to HLTV.org, a media specializing in the coverage of the video game’s competitive scene.</p>
<p>Bringing Quality CS:GO Events to Esports Fans</p>
<p>Pinnacle Cup V will see Pinnacle, the sports betting company hosting the iconic series, continue its data partnership with GRID, and expand its collaboration with Eden Esports on production. Pinnacle Cup will in the meantime remain a format where teams of different skill levels can still come forward and showcase their skills and abilities. Commenting on these developments, both companies expressed their excitement to be a part of the new format.</p>
<p>GRID Esports head of sponsorships Harry Wiggett said that by choosing to stick with his company, Pinnacle was securing access to top-class entertainment for CS:GO fans with data at the core. Wiggett added:</p>
<p>Pinnacle’s commitment to contribute to the esports scene’s sustainability is unparalleled, and the fact that we are working together on the Pinnacle Cup project for the third consecutive year is the best testimony to our shared values and aligned vision.

<p>The format features a Play-In stage which will see participating teams play in a Swiss Stage format and then make it into the Playoffs.</p>
<p>Teams of Varying Levels Headed into the Pinnacle Crucible</p>
<p>The Swiss Stage will have teams such as Spirit, ECSTATIC, Aurora, and EYEBALLERS compete for a chance to progress further. The winning team of the event will secure the bulk of the $50,000 prize pool as they go along. Last year, Heroic emerged victorious in Lund, Sweden.</p>
<p>Pinnacle has made a commitment to bring the event to global audiences and the event will be streamed in both English and Russian via the company’s Twitch channels. There will also be a stream available on the company’s YouTube channel. Pinnacle is also one of the earliest adopters of esports betting solutions.</p>
<p>The company started offering esports bets way ahead of other sportsbooks and bookmakers in the markets. In the early days, Pinnacle was one of the very few companies to make this vertical profitable. This was owing to the company’s innate understanding of the segment.</p>
