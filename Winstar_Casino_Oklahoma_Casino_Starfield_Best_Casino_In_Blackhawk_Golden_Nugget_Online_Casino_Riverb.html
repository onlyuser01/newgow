<p>Macau has finally lifted its mask mandates, authorities said on Sunday, February 26 confirming that citizens and visitors would no longer be required to wear a mask in the majority of locations in the Special Administrative Region apart from public transportation and hospitals, along with a few other locations where wearing a mask remains compulsory.</p>
<p>The government confirmed that the pandemic has been under control in the past two months, demonstrating confidence in the recovery plan charted by the mainland which abruptly lifted COVID-19 restrictions. The Novel Coronavirus Response and Coordination Centre has made changes to the mask-wearing requirements, citing global experience with the virus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong has confirmed that it is extending its mask mandate until at least March 8, but authorities seem confident that they will be ready to drop the mask mandates as well. Both SARs are keen to follow on the mainland’s example which pronounced a defeat against COVID-19 after public discontent forced the government to rethink its strategy and do away with restrictions altogether.</p>
<p>Macau’s Outlook Remains Stable Despite Setbacks</p>
<p>In Macau, individuals who show flu-like symptoms are still encouraged to wear their masks in public and open spaces, although there seems to be no official rule seeking to impose this. Meanwhile, the SAR has enjoyed a slight uptake in its casino and gambling stocks with the return of travelers from the mainland.</p>
<p>On Friday, most of the Hong Kong-listed shares of companies such as Sands China, Melco International Development and MGM China increased. The SAR is still not close to recovering to the pre-pandemic level but a recovery is underway nevertheless.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Macau’s gross domestic product (GDP) was heavily dependent on gambling – with around 50% of GDP coming from this sector. Macau’s government has used the pandemic as an opportunity to make the SAR more resilient to mass disruptions and shocks in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>A newly regulated market now expects gambling concessionaires to also invest heavily in boosting tourism and specifically try to target non-Chinese nationals when offering their gambling products. Meanwhile, not all has been pretty for former workers involved in Macau’s VIP gambling industry who are presently left with fewer job options.</p>
