    <h1>Ny Casinos Casino Hotel Biloxi Ms No Limit Coins Casino Walker Mn Casino Riverside Hotel And Casino</h1>

<p>Hi Tomas,</p>
<p>I have put this to compliance as well after reading the t&amp;c's on their site</p>
<p>Hello I also have a few questions to ask about your t&amp;c's</p>
<p>It states to contact this email about accessing funds in locked accounts so this can be done I take it ?</p>
<p>. Account Holders who wish to recover funds held in a closed, locked or excluded account, are advised to contact by email: compliance@trustdice.win.</p>
<p>All transactions are checked to prevent money laundering so how could I make so many unchecked or were they checked ? if so why not block account from the start.</p>
<p>5.4 All transactions shall be checked in order to prevent money laundering. If the Member becomes aware of any suspicious activity relating to any of the Games of the Website, s/he must report this to the Company immediately. https://trustdice.win/ may suspend, block or close a Member Account and withhold funds if requested to do so in accordance with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act or on any other legal basis requested by any state authority. Enhanced due diligence may be done in respect of withdrawals of funds not used for wagering.</p>
<p>It also states below. I requested the account to be closed due to games lagging so everything was wiped regarding t&amp;c's according to this:</p>
<p>6.1 If you wish to close your member account, you may do so at any time in the settings or by sending an email to compliance@trustdice.win.The effective closure of the Account will correspond to the termination of the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>I also noted below to them:</p>
<p>also noticed your banned countries but you have a very large amount of these countries as players so do you bend the rules to suit youselves with the t&amp;c's it certainly looks like it ! Im not sure these t&amp;c's have much weight to them !</p>
<p>do not permit accounts to be opened or used by customers resident in certain jurisdictions, including Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Australia, Spain, Singapore, China (including SARs), the United States of America (and her dependencies, military bases and territories), the Dutch Caribbean Islands (Curaao, Aruba, Bonaire, St. Maarten, St Eustatia and Saba), or other restricted jurisdictions ("Restricted Jurisdiction") as informed by us from time to time. By using the Website you confirm you are not a resident in a Restricted Jurisdiction.</p>
<p>I also enclose details from last account closure I found doing a search I was not aware of any rule breaking and it was not mentioned to me from them when it was terminated they just asked why I wanted to do it and I explained this to them I hope this is enough info for now I can dig up more if required I contacted them and they said its fine to play and use a VPN I have chat</p>
