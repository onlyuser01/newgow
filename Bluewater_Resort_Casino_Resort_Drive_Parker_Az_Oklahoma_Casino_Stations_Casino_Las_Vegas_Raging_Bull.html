    <h1>Bluewater Resort Casino Resort Drive Parker Az Oklahoma Casino Stations Casino Las Vegas Raging Bull</h1>

<p>I have only ever made deposits in this Casino.</p>
<p>A total of 3 deposits in the account.</p>
<p>With my last deposit I was relatively lucky and was able to win around 300-400 Euros. Instead of withdrawing the money I got engaged in one of the weekly tournament (Weekly Cash Race).</p>
<p>I won the third prize in the Weekly Cash Race from 18 Oct 2023, 11:00, which was 400 Euros.</p>
<p>Instead of withdrawing this prize, which is wager free and I could have withdrawn instantly, I opted in for the next Weekly Cash Race, (it is mandatory to manually opt in) and started betting 0.5 Euro bets to qualify and hopefully win another prize.</p>
<p>I checked my ranking in the tournament a few hours before the end of the tournament, and I was 3rd place, meaning I was meant to receive by the end of the tournament a prize of 400 Euros again.</p>
<p>The tournament ended at 09:00 AM UTC today, and I did not receive the 400 Euros to my account.</p>
<p>I thought its perhaps a bug in the system, so I refreshed the website multiple times and cleared history/cache etc... but the bonus was still not credited to my account.</p>
<p>I contacted the live support.</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Hey Agnes,</p>
<p>I was third place in the Weekly Cash Race tournament which ended 5 minutes ago. Last time I was also third and received the 400 Euro prize at 09:00 AM when the tournament ended.</p>
<p>I have not received any prize to my account yet, could you please check this, and credit me the 400 Euros?</p>
<p>I was rank 3 in the tournament, and played with my funds to qualify for this, funds which I was able to withdraw. "</p>
<p>Their response:</p>
<p>"Receiving bonuses are not available for you per administration's decision as the ratio of your bonuses to your deposits is high. You can play only for your real money (deposited money), make real money bets and withdraw your winnings.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about this"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"kay, but I had qualified for the tournament with money that I could have withdrawn, but rather played in the casino! And I reached rank 3, which was 400 Euro prize, by betting 0.50 cent bets with money I could withdraw. I understand if you want to exclude me from future tournaments or bonus promotions, but I spent all my money to qualify for the tournament, and its not fair to take the prize now away! Also I never received an email about this decision! This is outrageous!"</p>
<p>She replied:</p>
<p>"Carlos, I understand your feelings. This decision about your account was made yesterday, that is, after your tournament. In case you contacted us yesterday, your prize could be added, but now, unfortunately, it's impossible."</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I only made bets that qualified for the tournament with real money, which I could withdraw.</p>
<p>Keep also in mind that I have made three deposits in this casino and never ever once withdrawn any money back.</p>
<p>I opted in the tournament manually, and had no restriction to opt in the tournament. Further more I was able to see my progress in the tournament all week, until the very end, and never received any information that I am no longer able to play in tournaments.</p>
<p>I lost the 500 Euro real money balance which I could have withdrawn by playing for the tournament. I think its outrageous that they "decided" a few hours before winning the prize which I won fairly that I am no longer eligible, specially when I have not once made a withdrawal, and only deposits. This looks very much like a scam to me, and I want the 400 Euro wager free bonus which I am entitled to.</p>
