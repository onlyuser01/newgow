    <h1>Poker Casino Aliante Casino Hotel Spa Quick Hit Casino Wild Casino 100 Free Spins No Deposit Chumbo</h1>

<p>Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort on Tuesday announced a new partnership with Kambi Group and GAN to expand its reach into the online gaming and sports betting industries, launching an online platform “Eagle Casino and Sports” in early 2022. This will allow users to play online games and access sports betting. The games available online will include both slot machines and table games.</p>
<p>Michigan to Get New iGaming Option</p>
<p>Kambi will be the multi-channel sports partner of the project, while GAN will provide a platform to integrate online gaming and sports betting. “Together, they will provide a great experience for players,” Soaring Eagle said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a press release, Kambi Corporation discussed the terms of the deal and explained that Saginaw Chippewa Gaming Enterprises will integrate its on-property sports platform at Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort and Saganing. Eagles Landing Casino and Hotel, in addition to launching an online sportsbook.</p>
<p>GAN adds that it will be working on the design and development and web application of sports betting and gaming user interfaces with Soaring Eagle for Apple iOS and Android systems.</p>
<p>Sports betting and online gambling have been legal in Michigan since January 2021 after Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed bipartisan legislation allowing it in 2019 in a single law incorporating both commercial and tribal casinos within its framework.</p>
<p>Michigan’s iGaming Market Continues to Grow</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the state’s iGaming market is growing. Michigan has seen good results with its gaming industry, and more operators are likely to enter over the next couple of years. In September, the state reported more than $100 million in gross gaming receipts for the online segment, according to data released recently by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. This was primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a board spokesperson.</p>
<p>“Commercial casino revenue (adjusted gross receipts) declined in 2020, but has started to climb back in 2021. When combined with the online numbers, commercial casino revenue is well ahead of what it was in 2019,” a spokesperson for the MGCB said. With this in mind, and despite the high costs of launching in the market, there is plenty of untapped potential waiting to be exploited. This could increase even more as states with legal iGaming markets continue to explore player pooling agreements to create even larger events with bigger payouts, which would attract more participation.</p>
