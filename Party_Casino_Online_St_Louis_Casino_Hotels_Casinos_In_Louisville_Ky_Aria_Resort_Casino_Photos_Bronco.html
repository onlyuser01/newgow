<p>US Integrity has announced a new partnership with Silver Reef Casino, which is preparing to go ahead with an official rollout of its sportsbook in the state of Washington. The casino, which is owned by Lummi Nation, is located in the northwest corner of the state, and it’s accessible both from Seattle, which is some 90 miles away, and Vancouver, BC, which is some 40 miles.</p>
<p>Silver Reef to Build on Its Sportsbook Proposition</p>
<p>Following an extensive renovation in 2013, the casino sports more than 1000 slot machines today along with 17 table games, a golf course, and now a dedicated sportsbook that will supplement the gaming experience. US Integrity works with multiple commercial and tribal casinos and sportsbooks already.</p>
<p>The addition of US Integrity aims to ensure that the sportsbook will meet regulatory standards and remain a benchmark for best practices in the gambling industry. Commenting on this partnership, Lummi Tribal Gaming Commission chairman Sean Lawrence said:</p>
<p>We are extremely excited to be working with US Integrity as we roll out regulated sports betting at Silver Reef Casino. Tribal Gaming Commission chairman Sean Lawrence</p>
<p>The partnership is essential for the company as it seeks to ensure that its sportsbook will be able to operate clearly and transparently. The tie-up with US Integrity will help the casino and sportsbook staff detect any betting abnormalities in real-time alerting relative parties to potentially suspicious wagering activity, which can be examined.</p>
<p>US Integrity will deploy its dedicated monitoring services that will be available to both Silver Reef Casino and the Lummi Tribal Gaming Agency. Thanks to these developments, players will be protected and the organizations will be carefully observing all levels of an athletic contest. Commenting on the partnership opportunity, US Integrity CEO &amp; co-founder Matthew Holt said:</p>

<p>Ensuring the Integrity of Sports Events</p>
<p>He also outlined the company’s mission statement which is to ensure that sporting contests happen in a conflict-free environment and that best-in-class insights and compliance solutions are provided to business partners as guardrails against the fraudulent betting activity.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to working with the exceptional team at Silver Reef Casino. Their commitment to instilling the highest integrity standards align with U.S. Integrity’s initiative to ensure that sports wagering remains fair and safe,” Holt concluded. The company has previously teamed up with MaximBet to ensure the integrity of the company’s betting markets.</p>
