    <h1>Casino Near Memphis Tn Best Real Money Casino Online Borgata Casino Nj Online Harrahs Casino Ca Nj C</h1>

<p>For the future, I recommend you to choose the casinos with at least a very good reputation on our website (the resolution in case of any problem would be much easier).</p>
<p>Usually, I would recommend contacting the gambling authority but since the casino has this rule clearly in their T&amp;Cs, I am afraid they are not able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I am afraid that until somebody from the platform start thinking why their casinos are so poorly rated and decide to change their terms, we can't do much to get your winnings. Of course, we publish your complaint and give Mr. James Casino more black points but the rating is already close to zero.</p>
<p>I am sorry that we could not help you more.</p>
<p>For example, if I deposit only €20 and bet them to a single number on roulette, my winnings should be 35x20=700, but instead, I can get only 10x20 = 200. Much worse is this rule in some slots where the winnings could be 500 - 2000 x bet. This rule affects the RTP, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>This rule should never apply for real money play. It significantly changes the RTP and put new players who don't deposit €500+ at first deposit into very unfair position.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we consider this case as against our fair gambling codex: https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos.</p>
