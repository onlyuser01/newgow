<p>Navarro has become part of an impressive ambassador team with members Ian Simpson, Vivian Saliba, Kara Scott, and Alexandre Mantovani</p>
<p>Navarro Started Her Poker Career in 2007-2008</p>
<p>Lucia Navarro is a professional poker player who has achieved notable success in both live and online poker tournaments. She was born in Novelda, Alicante, Spain, and started playing poker in 2007-2008.</p>
<p>According to her reports, Lucia Navarro had a keen interest in playing card games since childhood. She would often pester her family members to play all kinds of card games with her. As time passed, Navarro’s interest in card games became more focused on poker, and she began playing professionally in 2013.</p>
<p>Navarro was particularly skilled at online cash games but would occasionally visit her local casino to play more cash games and the occasional tournament. Her first significant win came in the form of a $22,000 payout after winning a CNP Valencia Main Event. In 2015, Navarro moved to London and began frequenting the Victoria Casino, where she kept winning.</p>
<p>Her success continued, and in 2019 she won the CNP Alicante Main Event and took home the grand prize of $35,000. Navarro is the first female player to win two CNP titles.</p>
<p>Navarro also recorded two cash prizes at the 2022 World Series of Poker, earning $2,638 after finishing 66th in the Ladies Championship and $46,800 for finishing in 241st place in the WSOP Main Event.</p>
<p>Lucia Navarro Excited to Prioritize Player Experience and Skill Development</p>
<p>In a video announcing her appointment as 888poker ambassador, Lucia Navarro expressed her excitement about the new partnership:</p>
<p>For me, it is a privilege to be an ambassador for 888poker. I am super happy. It’s been a pleasant surprise because it is a company that cares a lot about the good experience of the player in the room. It is like they look out for the player a lot and I like that. I also take it as a recognition of my career and the hard work I have done. Lucia Navarro, ambassador, 888poker</p>
<p>Navarro brings to 888poker a vibrant YouTube channel. She also has an avid fan base on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Navarro’s YouTube channel has been steadily gaining popularity, as she offers a unique glimpse into the life of a professional poker player through her lifestyle vlogs. Her videos offer an engaging and informative look into the daily routines and experiences of a successful poker player.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future, Lucia Navarro is determined to enhance her skills in the area of online cash games, which is her area of expertise. Rather than focusing solely on results, Navarro wants to prioritize the process of improving her game. In addition, she aims to broaden her horizons by honing her tournament skills.</p>
