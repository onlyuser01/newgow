<p>Pragmatic Play, an established B2B supplier and developer of online casino content, has signed a new partnership with Grand Casino Luzern and the company’s online brand, mycasino. The agreement will provide mycasino with a range of player-favorite titles which are some of Pragmatic’s signature games, including seasonal and festive choices such as Sweet Powernudge and Santa’s Secret Gifts, ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s festivities.</p>
<p>Other popular choices here include The Dog House, Sugar Rush, and Gates of Olympus, to name a few. Pragmatic Play is pleased with the opportunity to join what the company has described as one of the top performers on the Swiss iGaming market, which has focused on domestic brands but relied heavily on suppliers from abroad.</p>
<p>Pragmatic is similarly pleased with the opportunity to position itself in one of the most important iGaming jurisdictions in Europe, providing the company with reach to engaged and loyal audiences. Commenting on this alliance, Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides said:</p>
<p>"We are delighted to expand our footprint in Switzerland and take our distinguished slot vertical live with a leading brand in mycasino."</p>
<p>Cornides hailed the string of commercial successes the company had in Switzerland over the past 12 months and said that the supplier was happy to launch its offer with a number of leading operators, among which – mycasino. All of this is part of the company’s efforts to increase its player base.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem was similarly pleased with what he described as a "momentous win." Both businesses, Bliem said, shared a passion for providing excellent content to passionate players, and the entire team at Grand Casino Luzern and mycasino were excited to have the opportunity to work with another brand that is similarly aligned in values and commitment to customers.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been stepping up its production pace bringing numerous titles to market. The company is present in several verticals and delivers live casino, virtual sports, bingo, and especially slot content.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play recently unveiled a new pizza-themed slot where peckish players get to enjoy weirdly delectable gameplay. As to the company’s overall growth plans internationally, Pragmatic has been maintaining a robust pace of expansion. Pragmatic teamed up with Liderendeportes.bet to grow in Venezuela and strengthen its position in the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Earlier in December, the supplier also teamed up with Azerion to boost its European presence and double down on growth with the Whow Games social iGaming operator.</p>
