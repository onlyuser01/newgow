<p>Gaming Innovation Group has achieved another milestone with the company securing a license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to offer its services on the territory of the state. As a result, the company has been granted an “interim authorization” by the regulator and will now be able to provide its products in the Keystone State.</p>
<p>GiG Secures Important iGaming Market Entry in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>These products include the company’s player account management system and sportsbook software and grant further access to the company to the fast-developing US iGaming and sports betting market. GiG is committed to securing an ever-bigger market share and accessing leading states is the way to achieve this.</p>
<p>The company is particularly keen to continue growing in the Keystone State as Pennsylvania’s iGaming revenue has been growing on an annual basis, making the state one of the most desirable markets in the United States. This comes against the backdrop of the United States attempting to undertake mass legalization of its gambling market insofar as iGaming is concerned, with more than 34 states now running sports betting.</p>
<p>GiG general counsel Claudio Caruana said that the Pennsylvanian entry will have an important implication for the company’s further expansion plans in North America.</p>
<p>Two Quick Milestones Achieved Back-to-Back</p>
<p>This comes a day after the company confirmed that it has launched with PlayStar in New Jersey, helping the casino brand break ground into the Garden State and also launch with one of the leading platforms in the industry. Caruana remained focused on the Pennsylvania market, though, adding:</p>
<p>The addition of a Pennsylvania authorization to our ever-expanding list of supported markets is testament of the focus that GiG has placed on regulated markets which we strongly believe underpins sustainable and prosperous growth within the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Thanks to this entry, GiG will be able to continue and pivot towards new iGaming markets in the United States. GiG is already present in 26 regulated markets, and it plans to continue growing its presence in the world’s most important gambling markets. GiG has been building up its offer in Canada, the United States, and across Latin America, and Europe.</p>
