    <h1>Best Western Plus Casino Royale Center Strip Online Casino Bonuses Casino Machines For Sale North St</h1>

<p>The same situation as the Rolletto Casino and Fresh-bet Casino complaints I already submitted. I'm not sure if you will treat it as one or you will keep 3 different complaints to review.</p>
<p>I registered on their site on the 8th of May. Deposited probably around 100-200 euro. When I wanted to withdraw the money on 17th of May, I send documents for verification, which were accepted today morning. After I noticed that my account on fresh-bet is blocked, I checked this casino, because both have the same soft, and 20bets account got blocked as well without sending any email (20bets2). When I contacted the support, they said that my account is under verification and it might take up to six months (20bets).</p>
<p>I obviously used my personal details, didn't use VPN, didn't use forbidden betting strategies, made a deposit from my krypto wallet</p>
