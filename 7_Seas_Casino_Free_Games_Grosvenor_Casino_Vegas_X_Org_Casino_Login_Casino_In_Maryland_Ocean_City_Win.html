<p>BF Games, a developer of premium dynamic iGaming titles, has expanded its reach in Europe with a new deal. The studio inked an agreement with Stanleybet.ro, a leading online operator in Romania. Under the deal, BF Games will supply its new client with a vast range of exciting gaming titles.</p>
<p>BF Games Expands in Romania with Stanleybet</p>
<p>As per the deal, BF Games will power Stanleybet’s content offering with its critically acclaimed games. Some of the titles that will become available to Romanian audiences include hits such as Book of Gates, Buffalo Trail Ultra, Cave of Fortune, Energy Fruits, Hot Sunrise, Stunning Hot Remastered and Wild Jack Remastered, among others.</p>
<p>The current deal continues BF Games’ expansion in Romania, which is a market that the studio has been actively targeting. In September, BF Games agreed to supply games to Superbet, another Romanian operator. Shortly after, the studio minted another deal, this time with Favbet. Both agreements were welcomed by BF Games, which has a profound understanding of what players in the region want and is thrilled to expand its local footprint.</p>
<p>BF Games currently boasts a rich library of thrilling slot titles that is continuously expanding with new additions. The company is ambitious on creating a vast portfolio of games, allowing it to appeal to the needs of gamers all over the world.</p>
<p>Stanleybet, on the other hand, is a seasoned operator with years of experience in Romania’s land-based and iGaming market. The company opened a retail business in the country in 2004 and, more than a decade later, secured a license to operate online gambling as well. In 2018, the company finally launched its Kambi-powered online gambling site, foraying into the digital sector.</p>
<p>Melcaru Praised the New Deal</p>
<p>Claudia Melcaru, BF Games’ head of business development, spoke about the new agreement. She said that her company is very happy with the deal and is looking forward to powering Stanleybet with games.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to have signed this deal with Stanleybet.ro and are excited about beginning the next stage of our partnership as we both continue to grow in the Romanian market. Claudia Melcaru, head of business development, BF Games</p>
<p>She added that her team is always looking to extend the reach of its titles and expand its presence in regulated jurisdictions. Melcaru concluded that she hopes for an exciting future with Stanleybet.</p>
<p>Easter Europe has been a very important market for BF Games. Three weeks ago, the studio went south of Romania, launching its games in Bulgaria through Winbet, one of the biggest operators in the country.</p>
