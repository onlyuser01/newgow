    <h1>Northfield Casino Hollywood Casino Resort Gulf Coast Casinos En Las Vegas Double U Casino L Auberge</h1>

<p>Dear Juliap1987 and Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time and posting a review about LevelUp Casino.</p>
<p>Every comment we receive is highly appreciated as it helps us better understand the problems players face so that we may take action and prevent those problematic issues from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Let us begin by congratulating you on your winnings. Furthermore, we are delighted to inform you that our Team successfully processed your cashout request.</p>
<p>However, we would like to shed light on the situation that occurred. To start with, we want to inform that we have contacted the payment provider, and they have confirmed that transaction processing time may differ, and sometimes there is a delay.</p>
<p>Please be informed that our finance department approved the cashout on May 24. This information can be found in your playing account’s WALLET tab – TRANSACTION HISTORY.</p>
<p>Moreover, the payment provider, Interac, confirmed that the transaction was processed longer than expected and was divided into three payments. It may have been a delayed auto-deposit and late completion reporting through Interac, in which case the transaction may have appeared on their banking records as far back as May 2nd/3rd (relative to their timezone).</p>
<p>Therefore, dear Juliap1987, we ask you to contact Gigadat support to receive information about the withdrawal and provide them with the reference numbers we sent you. After that, the support team of the payment provider can check whether your payment was successful since it was processed in three separate transactions. You should have received three e-Transfer deposits of 500.00 CAD each since May 2.</p>
<p>Your patience and understanding are much appreciated.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>LevelUp Casino Team</p>
