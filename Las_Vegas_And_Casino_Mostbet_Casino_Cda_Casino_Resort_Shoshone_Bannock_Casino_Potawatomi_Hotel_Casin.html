<p>Global sports entertainment platform DAZN has signed a deal for the acquisition of ELEVEN Group’s global sports media division. The move is set to cement DAZN as a global leader in live sports streaming.</p>
<p>DAZN to Acquire ELEVEN Group’s Sports Media Businesses</p>
<p>Following the upcoming completion of the deal, DAZN will become the official broadcaster of Belgium and Portugal’s top soccer leagues. In addition, ELEVEN Group’s businesses will reinforce the company’s offer in Italy, Spain and Germany, three markets where DAZN holds top tier domestic soccer rights. The new agreement will furthermore expand the media company’s reach to several Southeast Asian markets, including Taiwan.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the integration of ELEVENsports.com will power DAZN’s offer with 40,000 match streams each year. ELEVEN, which has an existing relationship with FIFA, supports the creation and delivery of live games from as many as 90 FIFA Member Associations. When DAZN adopts this content, it will also boast the biggest portfolio of women’s soccer content.</p>
<p>Another brand DAZN will be acquiring is Team Whistle, a media business that will allow DAZN to connect with younger audiences. The brand currently ranks among the top 10 US media sports properties and boasts over 700 million followers.</p>
<p>The monumental deal will provide DAZN with access to many new audiences as the company continues to reinforce its foothold in sports media. Currently, DAZN offers the world’s most expansive library of on-demand sports content, including analysis and betting advice.</p>
<p>An Exciting Deal for Both Companies</p>
<p>Shay Segev, DAZN Group’s chief executive officer, commented on the partnership. He noted that the acquisition will help with the company’s ambition of becoming the leading sports platform. Segev said that he respects ELEVEN and everything it has achieved and is looking forward to working together with some of its workers.</p>
<p>DAZN has invested in building a revolutionary digital sports platform, where fans can enjoy the full range of interactive sport entertainment. We are looking forward to expanding these capabilities to new markets as well as leveraging ELEVEN’s capabilities in DAZN. Shay Segev, CEO, DAZN Group</p>
<p>ELEVEN Group’s chief executive, Marc Watson, said he sees DAZN as the future of digital sports broadcasting. He believes that the sports media giant will be the perfect home for ELEVEN’s brands.</p>
<p>Sport is global entertainment and joining with DAZN will be transformative, allowing us to access greater economies of scale and a global platform for our talented team. We couldn’t be more excited about this deal, and I’m really looking forward to working with Shay and the team at DAZN. Marc Watson, CEO, ELEVEN Group</p>
<p>When the deal is completed, Andrea Radrizzani, ELEVEN’s founder and chair, will join DAZN’s board as an executive director.</p>
