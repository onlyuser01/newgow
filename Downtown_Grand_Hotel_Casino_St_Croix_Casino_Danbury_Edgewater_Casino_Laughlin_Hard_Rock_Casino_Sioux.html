<p>Wazdan plans to certify and launch 46 games in the Czech market initially starting with 16</p>
<p>Provider of gaming content to the online casino industry Wazdan announced it has entered into a partnership with Apollo Games, an online casino operator in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>‘Dedication to Innovation and Development’</p>
<p>The partnership with Apollo Games will provide the online casino operator with Wazdan’s portfolio of games to make it the first operator in the country to feature gaming content from the licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) provider.</p>
<p>Andrzej Hyla, chief commercial officer at Wazdan, hailed the new partnership with Apollo Games, highlighting what the games developer and the online casino have in common.</p>
<p>“Apollo Games shares our dedication to innovation and development in entertainment, so we’re delighted to have formed this partnership together,” Hyla said in his comments on the first agreement for Wazdan in its latest market.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic to see our games live in as promising a market as [the] Czech Republic with an operator that has such in-depth knowledge of their customers’ preferences as Apollo Games,” he continued, eager to commence the partnership and see how the deal would help both companies to continue to grow.</p>
<p>Wazdan entered the Czech gaming market just before Christmas to mark its 7th market entry in 2022, following its launches in Bulgaria, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands in Europe, Michigan in the US and the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Following the partnership, Wazdan will make its portfolio of 16 certified for the local market games, including classic hits like Magic Fruits Deluxe, Magic Stars 3, and Sizzling 777 Deluxe available to Apollo Games online casino players in the country.</p>
<p>In-Depth Knowledge of Customer Preferences</p>
<p>Thrilled that Apollo Games became the first online casino in the country to introduce Wazdan games, iGaming head of Development at the operator, outlined that Wazdan games “are of the highest quality along with several unique features” that will help Apollo Games enhance the gaming experience for its players.</p>
<p>The game portfolio made available with Apollo Games includes titles with innovative features such as Volatility LevelsTM, which allow players a higher level of control over their gaming experience.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Wazdan is planning to certify for the local market a total of 46 game titles among which some of the developer’s all-time hits such as Power of Gods, 777 Crown, 9 Lions, Fortune Reels, and others.</p>
<p>Most recently, Wazdan expanded its footprint in Switzerland via a deal with Grand Casino Luzern and its digital brand, Mycasino.ch to begin releasing in batches its portfolio of games starting in the early months of 2023.</p>
