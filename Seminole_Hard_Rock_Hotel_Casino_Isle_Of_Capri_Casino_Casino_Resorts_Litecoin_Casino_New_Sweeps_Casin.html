<p>Kindred: The First Operator to Offer Gamban Software in the US</p>
<p>Under a new agreement, Unibet, which is a part of Kindred Group, is now able to provide its customers access to Gamban’s self-exclusion software. The partnership complements an existing agreement between Gamban and Kindred which dates back to 2017.</p>
<p>Kindred Inks Agreement with Gamban for the US Market</p>
<p>Leading online gambling operator, Kindred Group, announced today that it teamed up with Gamban to offer Unibet customers the ability to block gambling sites in the United States. Kindred Group, which is Unibet’s parent company, became the first operator in the US to enter into an agreement with the UK-based gambling software provider, Gamban.</p>
<p>As a result of the partnership, the software which became available for Unibet customers offers an online gambling self-exclusion tool. With the help of this tool, users can voluntarily exclude themselves from accessing any online gambling website on individual devices.</p>
<p>Besides on US soil, Kindred already has a long-standing business relationship with Gamban in other regions. The two companies are collaborating since 2017 for the European and Australian online market.</p>
<p>Gamban Is Excited to Team up with Unibet</p>
<p>Jack Symons, the co-founder of Gamban, said in a statement that the company is incredibly excited to partner with Unibet. Furthermore, he deemed the partnership as a huge step for the US industry.</p>
<p>“We’re incredibly excited to partner with Unibet and offer our blocking software in the US – it’s a huge step forward for the industry.” Jack Symons, co-founder, Gamban</p>
<p>Symons acknowledged that currently, there is no regulatory pressure for gambling operators to offer blocking software. Furthermore, according to him, this makes Unibet’s move a fantastic one, considering that the company decided to increase protection for US players.</p>
<p>Unibet – Responsible Gambling Pioneer in the US</p>
<p>Maris Catania, Head of Responsible Gambling and Research at Kindred Group, shared her excitement about the recent partnership. She revealed that Unibet currently offers exciting gambling experiences in New Jersey, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the company has also applied for licenses in Iowa and Illinois.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Catania said that bringing European know-how and expertise in Responsible Gambling to the US has been one of the goals which Kindred was looking to achieve. She acknowledged that now, the most recent partnership “aligns with this ambition“.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Catania stressed that the partnership complements the company’s goal for “zero revenue from harmful gambling by 2023”. In that line of thoughts, Kindred was the first gambling operator to report what share of its revenue is derived from harmful gambling, and issues a report each quarter. Furthermore, the company already offers Gamban software solutions for its customers in Australia and Europe.</p>
