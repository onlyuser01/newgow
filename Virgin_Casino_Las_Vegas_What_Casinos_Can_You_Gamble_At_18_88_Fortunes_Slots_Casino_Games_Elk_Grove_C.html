<p>After a one-week break, the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series is back. The next event on the program is the 2023 Ally 400, which will take place at Nashville Superspeedway on Sunday, June 25</p>
<p>The first of the 10 remaining races of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series regular season is on the program on June 25 at Nashville Superspeedway. This is going to be only the third edition of the Ally 400 race, with the first two being won by Hendrick Motorsports drivers, Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott.</p>
<p>These two are among only seven drivers with the Ally 400 odds shorter than +1000, suggesting that each of them stands a good chance of winning on Sunday. But what do we think? Keep reading to find out!</p>

<p>Analyzing the Odds of Top 2023 Ally 400 Favorite Kyle Larson</p>
<p>Kyle Larson is the man who won the inaugural Ally 400 two years ago, which is one of the reasons why he‚Äôs the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 Nashville Superspeedway race.</p>
<p>Another reason why he‚Äôs got the shortest Ally 400 betting odds is that he‚Äôs motivated to do better. Even though he‚Äôs sitting in 10th place, with the Noco 400 in April being the last time he won the race (or finished on the podium).</p>

<p>Still, there‚Äôs something you should know about Kyle Larson ‚Äì he‚Äôs loved by bookies, but this love is often unjustified. The thing is that he was the betting favorite in last year‚Äôs Ally 400 race as well but ended up finishing in 4th place.</p>
<p>Further, he was the favorite to win the previous NASCAR race ‚Äì the Toyota Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway ‚Äì but he finished 8th. He was the top favorite to win the first race of June as well, but he finished in 30th place in the Illinois 300 race.</p>
<p>Other Contenders to Pay Attention to at Ally 400</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr. is sitting top of the NASCAR Drivers‚Äô Championship right now with 525 points. He‚Äôs coming off a win at Sonoma, which was his second win of the season, as well as the fourth time he ended up on the podium.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it‚Äôs no surprise he‚Äôs one of the drivers with 2023 Ally 400 odds coming in the form of a three-figure number. In addition to him and the No. 1 favorite Larson, there are another five drivers with odds of under +1000. Those are, namely, William Byron, Kyle Busch, Christopher Bell, Ryan Blaney, and Chase Elliott.</p>
<p>Of these five, Busch looks like the best bet, mainly because his form has improved a lot lately ‚Äì he finished on the podium in both of the races run this month.</p>
<p>Which Ally 400 Underdog Can Shine at Nashville Superspeedway?</p>
<p>So far, there have been 16 races of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series, with 10 different drivers winning at least one race. There are a couple of elite drivers who are still without a triumph in the 2023 season. Among those are Ross Chastain and Kevin Harvick, who are currently occupying 3rd and 4th place in the Drivers‚Äô Championship, respectively.</p>
<p>Each of them has 2023 Ally 400 odds of under +2000, suggesting that bookies think of them as dark horses for the June 25 race. These two are in decent form in 2023, with a huge motivation to win at least one race before the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>Plus, they both have some nice memories from the Nashville Superspeedway. Ross Chastain finished 5th last season, while in the inaugural Ally 400 race, he was second. Kevin Harvick wasn‚Äôt as great, but he did finish in the top 10 each time.</p>
<p>2023 Ally 400 Predictions</p>
<p>Even though odds favor Kyle Larson, we think that Martin Truex Jr. should be the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 Ally 400. It‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs probably the best driver (with the best car) right now. And if a surprise is going to happen, we think Ross Chastain might be the one behind it. He‚Äôs got everything necessary to get a respectable finish on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: Martin Truex Jr. to win; Ross Chastain to finish in the top 3</p>
