    <h1>Jokers Wild Casino Doubledown Casino Promo Codes Free Chips Indian Casinos Near Me Casino Card Game</h1>

<p>Play’n GO has become the latest supplier to obtain a B2B supplier license in Sweden, as the country is in the process of renewing the licenses of existing operators and suppliers, and also accepting new applicants.</p>
<p>In this case, Play’n GO is enjoying a license renewal done ahead of the deadline set by the government, and in a quick manner that demonstrates the company’s strong local presence and commitment to regulatory standards. Play’n GO has been growing significantly over the past months, but it has remained faithful to core markets in Europe and specifically, Sweden.</p>
<p>The license extension allows the company to continue deploying many of its excellent games, including Book of Dead, Legion Gold, and Reactoonz. The company also features north of 300 quality titles that can be deployed with various regulated operators in Sweden.</p>
<p>Company Chief Commercial Officer Magnus Olsson had nothing but praise to offer for the development. He said that Play’n GO felt that Sweden is the company’s own stomping ground, and confirmed that the supplier was interested in maintaining its "firm roots" in the market, despite the significant expansion it has achieved over the past years.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been steadily pivoting towards the North American market, obtaining a license in Ontario, Canada, and then securing entries in New Jersey, Michigan, Connecticut, and West Virginia to name a few. Despite this global growth, Olsson confirmed that his company would continue to supply its titles to Swedish players.</p>
<p>"Our content today is used by operators in the Swedish market to excite and retain their players. with innovative cross-sell slots like Gerard’s Gambit on the horizon, I don't think the Swedish market has truly seen the full might of Play’n GO yet," the executive added.</p>
<p>He thanked Spelinspektionen, the national gaming regulator, for completing the reviewing process swiftly and allowing Play’n GO to continue focusing on the delivery of outstanding products.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has been scaling its European presence at the same time, with the company launching content with Casino.777.nl in the Netherlands and Sky Betting and Gaming in the United Kingdom.</p>
