<p>Complementing the freshly minted 10-year contract with the National Lottery in Malta, IGT also signed an instant ticket printing services partnership with the lottery</p>
<p>The globally-recognized gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced it signed a new major contract for the lottery in Malta. IGT released details regarding the new deal on Wednesday, revealing that its subsidiary, IGT Global Services Limited entered into a new 10-year contract with the new operator of the National Lottery in Malta and IZI Group subsidiary, National Lottery plc.</p>
<p>An initial agreement saw IGT’s technology replace a solution by a competitor. As a result, the company’s world-class central system has gone live with the National Lottery in the country back in July 2022.</p>
<p>In addition to the 10-year deal with National Lottery, IGT confirmed that it signed a contract for the printing of instant tickets. That collaboration is expected to run through June 2032, helping the National Lottery to reintroduce instant tickets for customers within the market.</p>
<p>After collaborating with IGT, the National Lottery delivered an extra draw day for the most traditional and successful game in Malta, LOTTO. Moreover, the duo launched two new draw games, Super 5 4-3-2-1, as well as Pick 3. Those were the first such games launched in the last decade. Now, thanks to the recent deals, IGT is expected to play a pivotal role in the National Lottery’s retail growth.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited to Power Up the Lottery in Malta</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT’s chief operating officer, global lottery, explained that together with the National Lottery, the company has implemented its comprehensive lottery system. At the same time, he outlined that the process also involved the delivery of retail equipment.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Gendron said that IGT was able to deliver its technology and bring new draw-based games for a record time. “We are now focused on working with the Lottery to inspire continued sales growth responsibly through innovative technology and compelling instant ticket content that engage players,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>“National Lottery plc and IGT had an ambitious, seven-month timeline to complete a comprehensive lottery system implementation and deploy new equipment throughout Maltese retailers.“ Jay Gendron, chief operating officer, global lottery at IGT</p>
<p>As a globally recognized leader within the lottery vertical, IGT currently provides technology for eight out of 10 of the largest lotteries around the world. Moreover, the company’s solutions cater to 16 of the top 25 lotteries around the globe.</p>
<p>Johann Schembri, IZI Group’s CEO and founder, shared his excitement about the collaboration with IGT. He acknowledged the company’s unquestionable leadership when it comes to lottery technology. Additionally, Schembri deemed IGT the perfect partner for the National Lottery in Malta. Finally, the CEO and founder said that the company is looking forward to taking the user experience to a new level thanks to the solutions and services provided by IGT.</p>
