    <h1>Casino Redding Ca Poker Casino Near Me Wittenberg Casino Lucky Red Casino Casinos In Illinois With H</h1>

<p>The company’s crash-style game is now going to be available for users in the South African market thanks to 10bet</p>
<p>This marks an important achievement for the company as well, which has been growing its presence across the African region in general and bringing new content opportunities for local operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>10Bet will now have access to Spaceman which will introduce players to Pragmatic Play’s crash game for the very first time in South Africa and help both brands considerably expand their local presence and appeal to local audiences.</p>
<p>The game is simple enough, as it will see players bet on a Spaceman who takes to the stars in a rocket. At some point, the rocket will end up crashing, but the question is – when. As long as the Spaceman travels, a multiplier continues to increase – a player who ejects prior to the crash scoops up the entire payout.</p>
<p>The multiplier can reach 5,000x, but you must try to balance between the potential payout and the risk to crash. The game offers excellent graphics, fun gameplay, and intuitive UI that makes it easy to get involved right away and figure out the rest as you go.</p>
<p>Spaceman Makes His Debut in South Africa</p>
<p>Pragmatic and 10bet are happy to see this partnership form as it allows the supplier to bring more cutting-edge content to the market and offer inspiring solutions to local players. 10bet on the other hand is happy to get its hands on innovative content that will dramatically set its offer apart from other companies in the region.</p>
<p>Besides, 10bet and Pragmatic Play have already been collaborating in other regions, including Europe and Latin America. Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s COO, hailed this fresh opportunity to deepen the ongoing collaboration between the companies and said that Spaceman was expected to truly take off with 10bet players.</p>
<p>“Spaceman is a beautiful game with uniquely engaging mechanics and hugely appealing social features,” Cornides explained. The partnership was similarly welcomed by 10bet South Africa CRO Michelle Colborne who was similarly happy with the opportunity to see the exciting game in the market.</p>
<p>“At 10bet South Africa, we’re trendsetters and committed to providing our players with the best gaming experience possible. Spaceman is a perfect example of the high-quality games that we have to offer,” Cornides said.</p>
