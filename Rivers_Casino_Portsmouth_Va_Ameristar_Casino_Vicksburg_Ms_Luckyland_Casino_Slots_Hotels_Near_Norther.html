<p>The leading online gambling industry solutions provider, Evolution, expanded its US reach earlier this week. The company announced Thursday it launched its second live casino studio in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Second Live Casino Studio from Evolution Launches in New Jersey</p>
<p>The Garden State is a key US gambling market. Back in August 2018, Evolution opened its first studio in New Jersey. This also marked the company’s first studio in the US as well. Now, the company expanded its presence further in the state.</p>
<p>Although the official announcement came this Thursday, Evolution said that the new studio launched on November 10, 2022. It’s no surprise that to launch a second live casino studio location in New Jersey, the company secured approval from the gambling regulator in the state, the Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>

<p>With the recent launch, Evolution further expands its range of live casino games for operators in the market. In fact, the company revealed that its Football Studio, the first-of-its-kind live dealer version of a top card game in North America will also be available.</p>
<p>The recent launch of Evolution’s second studio in New Jersey complements the company’s ongoing growth. This marks the fifth studio that meets the high demand of the growing iGaming market in the US. Besides New Jersey, Evolution has the first operator to launch Live Casino for players in Connecticut, West Virginia and Michigan.</p>
<p>The Company Continues US-Facing Expansion</p>
<p>Jacob Claesson, Evolution’s CEO for North America, said that the recent launch marks a landmark moment for the company. He added that a key goal for the company in North America is to provide unrivaled entertainment for the players by offering operators the needed tools and games.</p>
<p>“This is another exciting landmark for our operations in North America.“ Jacob Claesson, CEO for North America at Evolution</p>
<p>Claesson added: “The studio was built thanks to the strong demand that we see in the state and will cater for our expansion in the years to come. It will give us the space needed to continue bringing new games to players in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>He vowed that Evolution will be hiring more employees in the coming weeks and months while seeking to expand and introduce more tables and games. Finally, he said that the company continues to develop an “incredible team in North America and offer exciting new opportunities to both operators and players.”</p>
