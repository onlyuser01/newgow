<p>10bet signs biggest soccer partnership in its history</p>
<p>Juventus to promote its brand outside Italy</p>
<p>Blanket ban on gambling ads in the country rule out Italy as a market</p>
<p>Juventus has signed a marketing partnership with 10bet to boost awareness and improve engagement outside of Italy.</p>
<p>10bet Boosts Marketing Campaign with Juventus Partnership</p>
<p>Betting agency 10bet has struck up a new partnership with Italy’s Serie A soccer club Juventus, marking the largest official gaming and betting partnership the sportsbook has signed to date. 10bet and Juventus will collaborate on promoting brand awareness over the next three years.</p>
<p>The company has picked an important soccer club and one where Cristiano Ronaldo currently plays. However, 10bet and Juventus won’t be able to advertise in the team’s native country, following a blanket ban on all public gambling ads in the country that was enforced in January 2019.</p>
<p>Instead, the pair will be focusing on promoting outside Italy. 10bet is going to replace Betfair, another popular betting brand, as the main soccer club’s sponsor. As a result, the brand will focus on developing promotional content and looking into marketing activities for supporters. There will be various contests as well as prize giveaways to boost engagement.</p>
<p>While 10bet seems to be getting most out of the partnership, Juventus believes that a partnership with a betting agency would help Juventus increase its footprint outside Italy. With the English Premier League (EPL) being the most watched soccer league on television, other high-profile teams are also attempting to boost their viewership numbers.</p>
<p>Juventus chief revenue officer, Giorgio Ricci, had this to say commenting on the occasion:</p>
<p>The particular attention paid to the global markets and audiences, a key theme for 10bet and the club, attests to the perfect synergy between our companies. In fact, this agreement fits ideally into the ongoing international growth project that has been in development by Juventus for years now.</p>
<p>The club is now focusing on developing entertainment and engagement activities outside Italy, Ricci explained.</p>
<p>Italy Still Off the Map Because of Gambling Ads Ban</p>
<p>Despite the partnership with a Serie A soccer club, 10bet is aware of the current legal situation in the country. Advertising and pushing gambling in Italy would be impossible due to the Dignity Decree which has banned all forms of gambling advertisement.</p>
<p>As a result, sports teams are not allowed to display gambling or betting companies’ logos nor should their official marketing campaign refer or allude to gambling in any form. Incentives to gamble such as giveaways are also banned.</p>
<p>10bet spokesperson said that the brand was thrilled to be teaming up with a prestigious team such as Juventus: ‘We are passionate about presenting our audiences with the most unique and entertaining products and we’re confident this will be a mutually beneficial long-term partnership.’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company hasn’t had many partnerships to speak of. Rather, 10bet is sponsoring a Tier 2 Championship team in England – the Blackburn Rovers. Nevertheless, the betting agency is already present in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, and Malta already.</p>
