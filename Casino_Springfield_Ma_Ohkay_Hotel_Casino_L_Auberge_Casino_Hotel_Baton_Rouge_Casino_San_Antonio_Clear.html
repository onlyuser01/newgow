    <h1>Casino Springfield Ma Ohkay Hotel Casino L Auberge Casino Hotel Baton Rouge Casino San Antonio Clear</h1>

<p>I learned the hard way to not bet over the maximum allowed bets and always ask support to confirm maximum cashouts when taking a bonus... Most of us do.</p>
<p>I've attached two separate transcripts. One from before the win and one after.</p>
<p>At Comic Play, I had recently broken the rules on a Welcome Bonus. I got four 3s with the kicker (4 in this case) on Triple Double Bonus Poker with an allowed bet of $25 ($10,000 win). Admittedly, I broke the rules betting $60 - $80 - even $100 a spin after i won the card hand, so I lost everything except for my deposit.</p>
<p>Now, I see another bonus opportunity. I tried the Wonder Box promo and won a 450% bonus. On Comic Play the T&amp;C of these Wonder Boxes states "maximum cash out varies depending on the bonus so be sure to check..."</p>
<p>Well, to my knowledge there is no listed T&amp;C for the 450% bonus, so i went to support and asked them BEFORE i deposited what are the max bets and max cashout. (transcript attached).</p>
<p>I was told, and I even verified with the guy twice in the attached transcript there is NO MAX CASH OUT with a max slot bet of $10 and a max poker bet of $25.</p>
<p>I hit a grand jackpot with an $8.40 bet. I immediately contacted support and asked them if my bonus was good (transcript attached). i was told i could only cash out $3,500 (@ $2,500 a week). I was transferred to a manager who apologized for what the person told me but it wasnt true.</p>
<p>And the will not honor it. It's just a bummer... like come on. I don't even know if they are going to pay out the first $2,500. I'm very doubtful. They did confirm i didn't violate the bet restrictions. They just are only going to give me half my winnings. It is a real bummer to FINALLY win a grand and then have this nonsense ruin it.</p>
<p>Thank you Casino Guru. If nothing else it was nice to share.</p>
