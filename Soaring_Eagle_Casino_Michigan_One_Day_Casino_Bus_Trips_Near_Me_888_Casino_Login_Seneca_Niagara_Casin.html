<p>No. I did not insert any wrong bitcoin address, they are generated by the coinbase wallet, I only press a button under the bitcoin wallet I hit the "Receive" button, and a bitcoin address is generated by the App, I had nothing whatsoever to do with choosing the receive to bitcoin wallet, because ir generates a new bitcoin address with each withdrawal requested, so how could I possibly make up a wrong bitcoin address, because I have bought, sold, and spent bitcoin for over the past three years and have received many bitcoin payments to several different bitcoin wallets, and have never, not even once, had a problem in receiving a bitcoin payment except this one time, and told it is my fault that I gave a wrong bitcoin address, and that there is nothing that can be done because of this error, and the casino says, therefore, it is forever lost!</p>
<p>I do not believe it is lost, I have the bitcoin wallet address to where the $1900.84 USD payment was sent, it waa given to me by Raging Bull Slots Casino and they have to be able to track this transaction for the IRS, and it is clearly seen thar any attempts by anyone to spend rhe bitcoin from that sent address can be traced to the person tryimg to manipulate the progression of the blockchain nodes, its all visible and makes it almost impossible to manipulate to one's doing, because it makes it known on the blockchain any and all transactions and so can you imagine at tax time, to just tell the Dept of Revenue that ww dont know about that payment or this payment, because we sent it to the wrong bitcoin address, so its forever lost, so lets just cross it off as it does not exist so we cannot be taxed for it because its lost forever! I doubt the IRS would see that as legit so there would be much more info to satisfy that Dept of Revenue, the above answer to them would be absurd, and you and I both know, that IRS would immediately launch a thorough investigation, so someone needs to find better answers, because its that time of year again, its tax season, updates will be very much needed!</p>
<p>Its now June 03/2023, and Im still waiting to be paid my 1900.84 which just sits in limbo updated daily and its up to approx $2305 now, bur somebody knows how to get this money to my proper addesss that should have been done on day one,</p>
<p>Thank you, Doyle Frady</p>
