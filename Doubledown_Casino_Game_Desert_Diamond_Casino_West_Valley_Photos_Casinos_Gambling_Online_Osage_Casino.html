<p>Australian-based sports betting operator PointsBet announced today the appointment of Paige Spiranac as its new global lead on-air. Spiranac also became a brand ambassador to follow in the footsteps of Shaquille O’Neal who recently became PointsBet’s ambassador in Australia.</p>
<p>Engagement with Audiences</p>
<p>The addition of the most influential media personality in the world of golf will contribute to the ongoing efforts of the company to expand into new markets and engage with sports audiences.</p>
<p>“Today is a very exciting day for the company as we welcome Paige, the No. 1 most followed and interacted with golf personality on social media in the world, into the PointsBet family.” Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet US</p>
<p>With proven abilities to cultivate engaged audiences in sports, Paige Spiranac and PointsBet are very much alike regarding their desire to stand out in the crowd, as the sportsbook provider is popular with the most differentiated way to offer wagering in sports, Aitken continued.</p>
<p>“We will look to deeply integrate Paige across our portfolio of brand channels, including linear and digital content, whilst unlocking unique ways to weave PointsBet into her social media universe as she strives to conquer sports betting and introduce it to her audience.” Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet US</p>
<p>Brand Ambassador</p>
<p>Besides making Spiranac a brand ambassador, PointsBet is offering her a chance to engage with the company long-term by taking a stake to become a significant shareholder.</p>
<p>“I believe that sports betting is central to how fans will engage and consume live sports moving forward.” Paige Spiranac, Brand Ambassador, PointsBet</p>
<p>Paige Spiranac would also be heavily involved in the creation of original content, will educate audiences in sports wagering on a weekly basis, host and comment on events, and be the leader for watch parties, marketing and promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>“I love connecting with my community on social media and I know this category will be a fun, new way to get my audience more involved with not only golf, but all sports. I truly believe in what we’re building at PointsBet and I’m thrilled to be a part of this team.” Paige Spiranac, Brand Ambassador, PointsBet</p>
<p>Paige became an influencer in social media following a trick shot she recorded and shared during the time when she was a member of the Women’s Golf Team at San Diego State University.</p>
<p>Since then, her authentic and fun approach to audiences allowed her to amass the largest amount of followers on any golf platform in the world as her Instagram profile is nearing the 3-million mark, while her total audience across all social channels is beyond 8 million.</p>
<p>Starting February 13, 2021, PointsBet will launch a $3 million Free Bets campaign, featuring the Selection Sunday for the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament. Over 30 days and 30 games, participants will receive $3 in free bets for every 3-pointer their selected team makes, while Paige will lead PointsBet’s Make It Rain promotion and will select the target college game for the night.</p>
