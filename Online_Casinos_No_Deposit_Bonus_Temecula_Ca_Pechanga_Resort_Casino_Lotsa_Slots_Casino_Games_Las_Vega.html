    <h1>Online Casinos No Deposit Bonus Temecula Ca Pechanga Resort Casino Lotsa Slots Casino Games Las Vega</h1>

<p>I built my balance rather quickly to about $220,000 on wildcasino.ag, a company owned by BetOnline, Sportsbetting, SuperSlots, and Tigergaming, which is referenced here https://www.commissionkings.ag. But I never collected that money. I was cheated, twice!</p>
<p>So I signed up, lost, lost, lost, lost, etc, then WON and kept moving my winnings up considerably over a short period of time. In the end I hovered at $220,000. I go straight to the withdrawal section, I’m done, I’m cashing out and I’m happy! When I enter $100,000 via bitcoin and hit submit, an error message pops up in so many words saying since you used a card for deposit, you have to wait 7 business days from the last date of deposit to make a withdrawal. Huh?! Why?! That’s not what I read...This was news to me as Wildcasino.ag specifically has a section on their FAQ page defining the payouts https://www.wildcasino.ag/faq that says it’s Mon-Fri</p>
<p>To me, that language seems like you can make a withdrawal any day but weekends. No mention of this sneaky error stating I needed to wait 7 business days to attempt a withdrawal. If that were the case, I wouldn’t have joined, as the quick and large payouts are the reason I chose them. Also, It even say on the payouts page https://www.wildcasino.ag/banking payouts would be same day. Again, why I joined. "QUICK &amp; EASY CASHOUTS</p>
<p>The next best thing to winning money is receiving the cash and spending it. We understand that speedy withdrawals are a priority for our players, which is why we offer same-day payouts. We offer a number of payout methods, so you can choose the option that works best for you. One thing you can count on is that we'll get you your money faster than anyone else."</p>
<p>So what gives? I look over all the links and find on their rules page https://www.wildcasino.ag/rulesthe very first two sentences under Payouts are " PAYOUT RULES</p>
<p>Payouts may be requested at any time online via the cashier.</p>
<p>Please allow 24 hours for your payout request to be reviewed before the processing time begins."</p>
<p>So, again this further confirms what I read in other sections that I can submit a payout request any time and it’ll be reviewed within 24 hours. But here’s the kicker. After those initial 2 lines it says ﻿ "Please note that players depositing via credit card, debit card or prepaid card are required to wait a minimum of seven business days from their last deposit prior to requesting a withdrawal." How on earth would I have seen this or known this existing. As a consumer when you go to the FAQ page and it clearly says you’re going to get paid same day, up to $100,000 at a time, and the same page all the deposit information but doesn’t say anything about this random waiting period, what normal person would think the FAQ’s aren’t adequate to validate the basic and important questions that would likely get asked? ﻿</p>
<p>So, Wildcasino.ag clearly misrepresented the true intent in all but one section of their site, perhaps the one section most don’t read. This is a massive difference to an online gambler waiting to leave the casino for 7 business days. Knowing 7 business days is an eternity when your access to the casino is instant, I decided to do the rational and smart thing and freeze my account to effectively ban me from gambling away my winnings, until 5/25, (the first available day for me to withdraw $100,000.) However, when looking for the settings to self exclude myself from play, I couldn’t locate it. It simply wasn’t on there.</p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿﻿I wasn’t made aware of the 7 business day waiting period for card and frankly it makes absolutely no sense. When I deposited this waiting period wasn’t mentioned. When I looked at the FAQ this wasn’t mentioned. Looking at the Withdrawals, absolutely no mention. Everything states submit the request and evaluated in 24 hours. With the exception of the singular page Wildcasino.ag knows their visitors aren’t going to first, there’s no mention of this. I believe my entire balance should be adjusted to the $220,000 as I wouldn’t have gambled it if I could have withdrawn it like I was lead to believe. ﻿﻿﻿﻿</p>
<p>﻿This is unacceptable, and for a company who limits their communication to email or chat only, if chat is not there, you’re at the mercy of when they decide to act on your request. It’s always unfair to state on the FAQ and Payouts, and when depositing pages, same day payouts and not disclose such a vital piece of info that if card is used 7 business days are added on to your waiting period in hopes you burn all your winnings and make it impossible to cash. ﻿</p>
<p>I am requesting my balance be restored and to afford me the ability to remove this waiting period to make my first withdrawal.</p>
<p>P.S. When you’re logged in to Wild, if you hit Contact Us and then click the email, it populates an email that gets bounced. Do you think they know this?? I’ll upload the video if requested.</p>
<p>-Respectfully</p>
