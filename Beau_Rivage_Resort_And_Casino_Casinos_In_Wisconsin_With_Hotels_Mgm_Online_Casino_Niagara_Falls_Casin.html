<p>Casino content house Stakelogic has unveiled Cash Express, its latest slot game. The new title will take players on a train journey to the heart of the Wild West.</p>
<p>Cash Express Takes Players to the Wild West</p>
<p>Cash Express is a 5×3 reel game with 25 paylines. The Wild West-themed slot allows players to collect various symbols such as cowboy characters, sheriff badges and letters. In addition, there is a train symbol that helps players unlock the Bonus Enhancer feature. At the beginning of a game, all Bonus Enhancers are locked. As players collect more train symbols, their progress toward unlocking a Bonus Enhancer is tracked.</p>
<p>When a player earns six or more train symbols, they can unlock a Cash Bonus that works as a bonus game. Players are also provided with the “Buy Bonus” option that allows them to directly activate the bonus game. During the Cash Bonus, players will be taken to a nighttime version of the Wild Western town where they will need to complete rows with symbols. Each time players fill an entire row, their base three free spins will reset, providing lucky players with the opportunity to greatly boost their multiplier. During the Cash Bonus stage, train symbols enhance the player’s multiplier, while cowboy symbols boost other tiles.</p>
<p>The cowboy symbols represent Bonus Enhancers and each of the four characters activates a different bonus. The first character reveals a multiplier of between x2 and x30. The second one will reveal another multiplier of between x2 and x50. The third one will reveal a multiplier of between x2 and x80. Lastly, the fourth character, which is also the rarest one, will reveal a multiplier of between x2 and x100.</p>
<p>The Games Is Packed with Great Features</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional slot action, Cash Express comes packed with a minigame where players can double their bet. After each of their winning during the base game, players can either collect their earnings or “gamble” them. If a player chooses to collect their sum, it will be instantly added to their balance. If they choose to gamble, however, they will activate the minigame.</p>
<p>During the gambling part of the game, the player is asked to pick either a card color or a card suit. Then, a random card is drawn from a deck. If a player guesses the color right, their bet will be doubled. Lucky players who successfully divine a card’s suit will have their bet quadrupled. Cash Express players can draw a card multiple times and can multiply their bet to up to x100.</p>
<p>The last feature that should be talked about is the Super Stake button. Players who activate the Super Stake will have their bets increased by 40% but will also increase their chances of landing on Scatter Symbols.</p>
<p>Olga Bajela, Stakelogic’s chief commercial officer, said that Cash Express is Stakelogic’s take on the popular Western runaway train theme. She described the gameplay as “electrifying” and said that players will be “gripping their seats with excitement” while playing.</p>
