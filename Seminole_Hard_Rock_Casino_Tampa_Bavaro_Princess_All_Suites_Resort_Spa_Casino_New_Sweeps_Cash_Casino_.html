    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Spa Casino New Sweeps Cash Casino</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>So today i'm writing this complaint regarding my experience with rolling slots casino which it operates with curacao gambling licence (Netherlands Antilles (Antillephone 8048 / JAZ2020-070)) everything was good at the beginning except for the responsible gambling section. So i had won a total of 9687,5 Euro till the 15th of july and in between i contacted many times the customer service to set a limit so i'll be sure i won't be addictive and don't gamble the whole sum away. Even i contacted the kyc team nicely to ask them to accelerate the withdrawal process and they started playing with rules like they have the right to determine the maximum and minimum amount to withdraw per day and to set and schedule the payment as they want without respecting the player. I was begging them many times and a employee just told me on the 14th of july that due to active balance my account couldn't be frozen which is against responsible gambling so what i got from their part was simply ignorance and my requests got rejected. So both wishes got ignored and they told me that such a possibility isn't available although at each online casino provider there's a whole section for reasonable gambling where the player adjusts the limit when in danger and that's what i wanted exactly. I find this really unfair and i'm really sick of such casino's behavior because it's the second time that i experience this matter with the same operating licence (vulkan.bet) where i ask for limits to be sure that i'll get the whole amount withdrawn but indeed i stay with empty pockets and lose everything because they know that with such an amount the player is insecure and will gamble it sooner and later they really don't want to cash out the money. So i'm asking you kindly once for all to intervene and help me out in such a matter to get the unfairly loss because the money is extremely needed and i really would appereciate your help. My id login is rad234 and the email address is samlosbagloss@gmail.com. And yeah just for information from the whole 9687,5 Euro i just got 500 Euro withdrawn which i gambled back after losing the pending amount of 9187,5 Euro.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you in advance for your help and your time dedicated to my case and i'll be looking forward to hear from you back.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
