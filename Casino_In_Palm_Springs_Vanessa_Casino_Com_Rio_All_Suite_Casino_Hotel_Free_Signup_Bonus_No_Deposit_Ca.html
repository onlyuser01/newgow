<p>B2B iGaming software provider Altenar sets foot on the German market for the first time through a brand-new partnership with established sportsbook ChillyBets</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 ChillyBets has been a licensed gambling operator in Germany since 2021 and is the first German operator to partner with Altenar, which already has partnerships with companies in other European countries such as the UK and Belgium. This new collaboration effectively increases Altenar’s presence in the European gambling market.</p>
<p>Altenar Makes a Perfect Partner for ChillyBets</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Malta-based B2B software provider for the igaming and sports betting industries offers a solution that is customizable and flexible to its sportsbook partners. In its work with customers, Altenar has made flexibility its top priority. Its range of experts does not shy away from the challenge of adapting the company’s software solutions to new audiences and markets.</p>
<p>Through the new partnership, ChillyBets is benefiting from the full potential of Altenar’s software and will become more competitive in a very saturated and thriving market.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the licensed German operator will have access to Altenar’s retail-based solutions, which have exploded in Belgium accounting for huge company growth in the Belgian market in the course of 2022. ChillyBets currently operates only online but should it decide to enter the brick-and-mortar market it will be fully equipped to do so.</p>
<p>Both Companies Have Expressed Their Delight Regarding the New Collaboration</p>
<p>Altenar’s Sales Manager Diego Salas expressed his delight that ChillyBets is their first licensed partner in Germany and added “ChillyBets, with its wealth of experience within this industry, is the best start we could have hoped for. There is no doubt this partnership will be a huge achievement and we are very excited to be able to tap into the German market for the first time following recent successes across the region.”</p>
<p>ChillyBets CEO Tal Zamstein also stated his excitement regarding the new deal with Altenar and his vision for a fruitful partnership: “We are sure that Altenar is the right partner in terms of the offer and the support to our efforts in this complicated regulatory environment.”</p>
<p>Providers Have Been Choosing Altenar as Their Partner</p>
<p>Altenar’s latest partnership deal signed in December was with L&amp;L Europe Limited, which chose Altenar as the provider for its new sportsbook project to be launched in the UK.</p>
<p>However, Altenar has also been spreading its presence to South America. It has partnered with Peruvian company Apuesta Total providing the sportsbook with its 360-degree solution.</p>
<p>Altenar’s reputation as a trusted partner does not only show through its multitude of partnerships but is also supported by the numerous awards and recognitions the company has received, including but not limited to the Baltic and Scandinavian Gaming Awards, EGR Nordics and SBC Latin America.</p>
