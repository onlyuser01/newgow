<p>As a result, the NBA is joining AGA’s long-standing “Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” public campaign designed to raise awareness for problem gambling in the United States at a time sports gambling is expanding rapidly.</p>
<p>AGA Welcomes NBA as Part of Bet Responsibly Program</p>
<p>The program seeks to educate basketball fans about the common pitfalls associated with gambling and introduce them to the hobby in a way that is sustainable and responsible. The message is now being picked up by all of the NBA’s 30 sports franchises.</p>
<p>AGA and NBA will work on the content together and use various media to spread the message, including in-venue, digital, and social media activations, broadcasts, and more. NBA’s SVP and head of gaming &amp; business ventures Scott Kaufman-Ross hailed this opportunity and said that responsible gambling was a crucial part of what the association stood for.</p>
<p>He said that responsible gambling is also a guiding principle to the way the NBA approaches sports gambling in the first place, and added:</p>
<p>Working with the AGA on this initiative is an important part of our multifaceted approach to this critical topic and will provide our teams with tools to make a true impact on responsible gaming education in NBA markets across the US and Canada. NBA’s SVP and head of gaming &amp; business ventures Scott Kaufman-Ross</p>
<p>AGA SVP Casey Clark was similarly pleased with the opportunity to welcome a new important partner to the association’s ongoing efforts to address responsible gambling and help safeguard consumers. Clark explained:</p>
<p>It’s critical that the entire sports betting ecosystem is united in our commitment to responsible gaming, and we are grateful for the NBA’s leadership in these efforts. AGA SVP Casey Clark</p>
<p>The program arrived shortly after the legalization of sports gambling in the United States and has been growing ever since. There have been numerous participants to the group over the past months, indicating its strength and an overall readiness by stakeholders to ensure that sports are free of manipulation.</p>
<p>Greenwood and Bally’s, Delaware North, and Penn National Gaming are among the entities that are active participants in the program. The program itself has gathered a lot of momentum, bringing under its room a number of prominent entities and sports leagues. MGM Resorts, MLB, NASCAR, the NHL, Parx Casino, PGA Tour, and many others are just some of the companies, leagues and sports bodies dedicated to making sports safer for their fans.</p>
