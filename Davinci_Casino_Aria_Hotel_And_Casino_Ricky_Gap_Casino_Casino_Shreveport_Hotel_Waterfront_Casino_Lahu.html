    <h1>Davinci Casino Aria Hotel And Casino Ricky Gap Casino Casino Shreveport Hotel Waterfront Casino Lahu</h1>

<p>The leading charity organization that delivers support for victims of problem gambling and focuses on the prevention of gambling harm and education, GamCare, announced a new senior-level appointment. The leading UK charity revealed that it hired the services of the seasoned charity consultant, Dâ€™Arcy Myers. Joining the charity, he was appointed as its new Interim CEO, a statement released by GamCare reveals.</p>
<p>The new senior-level appointment comes after this summer, the charity confirmed that its CEO at the time, Anna Hemmings, has decided to step down from her role. After being at the helm of GamCare for five years and helping it grow and navigate through different obstacles, Hemmings confirmed back in July that she intends to step down.</p>
<p>Becoming a part of the senior-level management at GamCare marked a thrilling moment for Myers. "I am excited to be joining GamCare and supporting our staff and partners in the hugely important work they do," he explained. Finally, Myers pointed out: "I look forward to meeting as many staff, service users and partners as possible in the coming weeks."</p>
<p>Margot Daly, GamCare's Chair of Trustees, welcomed Myers to the charity's growing team of experts. "His wide-ranging experience will be invaluable for the organization at a time of great change for this sector," she pointed out.</p>
<p>To his new role as Interim CEO, Myers brings extensive experience after being a part of different charities. Overall, he was a part of the sector for twelve years and during that time, he held important senior-level roles with The Percy Hedley Foundation, as well as Allergy UK.</p>
<p>Myers' professional background includes positions with the TV and Film charity, The Solicitors Charity and The Percy Hedley Foundation. In addition to the Interim CEO role, he holds a Chair role with The Smallwood Trust and The Association of Charitable Organizations.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the extensive experience Myers brings will help him in his new Interim CEO role with GamCare. In that position, he will oversee strategic processes and play an important part in the future of the charity. Still, as an interim position, it is yet to be confirmed when GamCare will appoint a permanent CEO.</p>
