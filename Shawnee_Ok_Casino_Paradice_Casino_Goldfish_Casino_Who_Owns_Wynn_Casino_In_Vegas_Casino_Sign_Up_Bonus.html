<p>Oscar Isaac will star in The Card Counter , an upcoming film from Paul Schrader</p>
<p>This is Schrader’s first film since First Reformed , and he has written films for Martin Scorsese</p>
<p>Isaac is known for his role as Poe in Star Wars</p>
<p>It has been revaled that Oscar Isaac will take on the starring role in Paul Schrader’s next film, The Card Counter.</p>
<p>Paul Schrader’s The Card Counter Will Star Oscar Isaac</p>
<p>The movie will be about a man named William Tell, a former solider who makes a living player poker. He meets a man named Cirk, who wants to hatch a revenge plan with Tell to make a colonel suffer.</p>
<p>Rather than agreeing to plot with Cirk, Tell brings him along on the poker circuit. La Linda becomes their backer, and the three eventually plan to win the World Series of Poker– however, Cirk is haunted by his past in the army.</p>
<p>“This is essentially an unlikely and surprising three-hander that weaves together the entertaining world of gambling; a potent and personal revenge thriller; unafraid to ask some extremely current and uncomfortable questions.”</p>
<p>The plot of the film sounds intriguing, and it only gets better knowing that Paul Schrader will be directing. If you’re not familiar with the name, his last film was First Reformed, the criticially-acclaimed movie starring Ethan Hawke. He has also written some of Martin Scorsese’s most famous films, including Taxi Driver, The Last Temptation of Christ and Taxi Driver.</p>
<p>If you follow Schrader’s projects closely, you were likely expecting his next project to be a neo-Western film called Nine Men From Now. However, very little has been heard about that movie for a while, so it may either be delayed or has been scrapped.</p>
<p>Fans will also be looking forward to seeing Oscar Isaac in another starring role. His breakthrough role came in 2013, playing the titular character in Inside Llewyn Davis, for which he received a Golden Globe Nomination. You’ll probably know him best as Poe Dameron from the recent Star Wars Trilogy and Apocalypse from X-Men: Apocalypse.</p>
<p>This will be one of many movies where poker plays is an important aspect; however, it doesn’t sound like the film is all about the game. There seems to be many different elements in The Card Counter so, even if you’re not a player, you’re sure to enjoy this film – if you’re a fan of revenge thrillers.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a good poker film to tide you over until The Card Counter hits cinemas, we can suggest a few:</p>
