<p>ESA Gaming has become the latest developer to expand in the Italian iGaming market through Sisal. The company will introduce the EasySwipe feature which will now be available at the highly regarded operator of betting and gaming solutions for the country. EasySwipe includes popular titles and options, such as Goal Mine and Basketball Mine along with a number of classic games that are popular with casino players.</p>
<p>EasySwipe Integrates Seamlessly with Sports Betting</p>
<p>There is more gaming forthcoming by ESA Gaming, though, including the innovative crash-style titles, such as the Rocket Racers one that is still in the pipeline but is expected to hit iGaming shelves before long. ESA Gaming prides itself on providing ultra-lightweight games that offer super-fast performance and sessions.</p>
<p>Players can swipe in and out and not have their sports betting experience disrupted, which is a great way to create iGaming content that complements the existing core focus, which remains sports gambling. EasySwipe’s portfolio is bound to increase its cross-selling capacity and ensure that this does not lead to segment cannibalization, an important focus of the development efforts.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming further focuses on bringing a top-of-the-rage experience that is provably fair and excites iGaming and sports betting crowds. The company is further expanding beyond Italy but reinforcing its foothold in the market is important. ESA Gaming business development manager Maria Luisa Malfasi welcomed the opportunity and said:</p>
<p>It is a great moment to see our EasySwipe offering go live in the Italian market, a concept we believe the local players will really enjoy. ESA Gaming business development manager Maria Luisa Malfasi</p>
<p>Partnering up with Sisal was a good step forward for the company in the market, Malfasi explained. She praised Sisal’s existing offer, which included top-of-the-range products. From this point in, Sisal’s players also get to benefit from ESA Gaming’s distinguished and worthwhile products. Earlier this month, ESA Gaming’s EasySwipe with BetShop in Greece.</p>
