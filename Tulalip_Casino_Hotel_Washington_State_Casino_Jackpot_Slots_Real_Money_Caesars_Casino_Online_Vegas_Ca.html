<p>Casino software developer Nolimit City has struck an important partnership with Coolbet, focused on expanding the operator’s portfolio with the full suite of Nolimit games.</p>
<p>Nolimit City Adds Full Range Casino Games to Coolbet Portfolio</p>
<p>Nolimit City, a supplier of cutting-edge iGaming products, continues to roll out its expansion strategy in 2020, tying up a new partnership with Estonia-based company Coolbet. Moving forward, Coolbet will offer the full portfolio of products by Nolimit City, including popular picks such as Deadwood Xnudge, Gaelic Gold, Barbarian Fury, Pixies vs Pirates, and other.</p>
<p>As of the time of the deal, Nolimit City has over 30 quality slot games to offer Coolbet’s players. Commenting on the developments, Nolimit City head of commerce, Malcom Mizzi, said that Coolbet was a brand that the company had a deep respect for. Mizzi specifically noted the brand’s commitment to player care and providing consumers with the best possible products.</p>
<p>He affirmed that Coolbet has an established track record and Nolimit City was honored to be considered the latest supplier to join the operator’s portfolio. Coolbet presently operates in Latvia and Sweden, as it holds licenses from the national regulators.</p>
<p>They have a well-deserved reputation and we are honored to be selected as their latest addition. Nolimit City Head of Commerce Malcom Mizzi</p>
<p>Recently, the company also added a license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), broadening the operator’s reach. Coolbet said in the past that it was committed to bringing an unrivalled gaming experience and focus on consumer protection.</p>
<p>Coolbet head of casino and games, Patrick Backlund, also shared his view of the partnership having this to add:</p>
<p>We are absolutely thrilled about adding Nolimit City to our fast-growing game portfolio. Coolbet Head of Casino Patrick Backlund</p>
<p>According to Backlund, Nolimit City has created a number of outstanding releases that fit perfectly with the casino’s own direction and gaming products. He further noted that Coolbet remained committed to bringing quality products to both its iGaming players as well as sports bettors.</p>
<p>Nolimit Continues to Expand Number of Partners</p>
<p>Previously, on the occasion of the Deadwood slot release, LeoVegas signed up a deal with Nolimit City to feature the game as part of its own portfolio. The company emphasized the acquisition of the xNudge mechanic which came with a combination of reels split into 3-4-4-4-3 sections. This boosts the maximum payout to 13,950x the size of the bet.</p>
<p>Again, in April, Nolimit City inked another partnership, this time with Betsafe, and in a bid to strengthen its presence in the Baltics. Specifically, the company is looking to consolidate its presence in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>At the time, Mizzi commented that Nolimit City will aim at every regulated market in Europe and that it was only a matter of time until the company’s games are available in every online legal casino’s portfolio.</p>
