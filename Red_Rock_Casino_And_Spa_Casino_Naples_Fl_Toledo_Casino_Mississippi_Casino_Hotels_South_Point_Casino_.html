<p>Better Collective Signed a Partnership With Boston.com</p>
<p>The second quarter of 2022 followed up on the success of Q1 and Better Collective showed that it does not plan on stopping. Most recently, the company partnered with Boston.com.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, the readers at Boston.com will be provided with betting odds and useful tips on upcoming games, as well as a team and player analysis. To make the process of sports betting simpler, Better Collective will also place direct links to sports betting platforms.</p>
<p>VegasInsider, a Better Collective subsidiary, will co-brand the partnership, which is set to be operational before the end of August, just in time for the start of the NFL season.</p>
<p>Kayvan Salmanpour, Boston Globe Media’s CCO, stated that Boston.com is thrilled to partner with Better Collective and provide millions of readers with unique and engaging content. He added that Boston.com’s award-winning sports coverage will now be boosted with extra information from the world of sports betting.</p>
<p>Marc Pedersen, Better Collective US CEO and SVP, also commented on the partnership. He stated that Boston is the home to many sports teams and a huge number of “enthusiastic fans.”</p>
<p>He also added that Better Collective expects Massachusetts to become one of the biggest sports betting markets in the country and Better Collective is happy to provide fans in this region with information that will help them learn more about their favorite sports.</p>
