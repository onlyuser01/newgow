<p>The prominent game developer has become part of the aggregation service by IGT, which will allow both companies to expand their reach and the strength of their portfolios</p>
<p>IGT PlayDigital is a dedicated content library focused on premium online and mobile casino games which will now feature some of 7777 gaming’s most prominent titles. Thanks to this tie-up, 7777 gaming is now featured as part of PlayDigital’s Game Aggregation Platform and will be available across a network of operators.</p>
<p>Reaching Global Audiences with PlayDigital’s Aid</p>
<p>7777 gaming CCO Elena Shaterova welcomed this opportunity and said that her company was excited to be teaming up with IGT PlayDigital and to expand its reach with new generations of players worldwide. “We are looking forward to strengthening and developing this partnership further towards achieving common goals,” Shaterova said.</p>
<p>IGT president of iGaming Gil Rotem was similarly happy to see 7777 gaming become a part of the company’s distribution and aggregation solutions. “Creating an exciting and extraordinary portfolio is key to engaging iGaming players,” he noted, adding that his company is looking forward to working together with 7777 and seeing its products launched across a number of markets and with some of IGT PlayDigital’s leading partners.</p>
<p>7777 presently has a portfolio that features more than 100 games, including all-time favorites such as Jinn, Fortunes of Rome, Knights and Magic, Golden Scarab, and many others. 7777 gaming reported outstanding results in December for the full year, hailing 2023 as an opportunity to maintain this momentum.</p>
<p>Since the year began, 7777 gaming has struck several prominent partnerships. The company teamed up with Sesame, an online casino operator in Bulgaria. 7777 gaming also teamed up with Infingame for content.</p>
