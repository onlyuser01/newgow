    <h1>Hollywood Casino Florida Best Casinos In Reno Limitless Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Casinos Tampa</h1>

<p>Dear Jteemu,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem but I’m afraid, I will need more information and details. Could you please elaborate? Do I understand it correctly that the amount of rewarded bonus has been deducted from your withdrawal? I have checked general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://www.horuscasino.com/en/info/bonus-terms-and-conditions:</p>
<p>„Each bonus in Welcome Package is "sticky" and will be forfeited once you make a withdrawal request. Bonus restrictions (maximum betting limit of 4€, forbidden games, maximum cashout of 5 times the received bonus amount) apply until the withdrawal request has been processed or winnings generated from mentioned bonus are part of players' balance.</p>
<p>Example: You deposit 100€ and get a 200€ bonus. You win an additional 500€ and have a total bonus balance of 800€. Once you request a withdrawal, the initial bonus of 200€ will be deducted from your balance, and you will be able to withdraw 600€ (which is within the maximum 5 times withdrawal limit, see clause 10.2.10)."</p>
<p>Please let us know if this advice was helpful or we need to intervene. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
