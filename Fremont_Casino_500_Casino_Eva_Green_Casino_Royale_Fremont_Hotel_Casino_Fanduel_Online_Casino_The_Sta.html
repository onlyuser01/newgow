<p>The announcement comes during a difficult period for the Star Entertainment after a government probe, fines and threat for its license</p>
<p>A probe into Star Entertainment’s operations last year uncovered deficiencies and alleged ties to criminal activities such as money laundering. The investigation, led by Adam Bell SC, which became popular as the Bell Review, sought to determine the eligibility of The Star to hold a license.</p>
<p>In light of this, the NSW Independent Casino Control Commission (NICC) claimed that the operator isn’t suitable to hold a license. Still, The Star was given a chance to remedy the situation and ensure its compliance with the regulatory framework and license conditions.</p>
<p>Besides that hurdle, The Star was slapped with a hefty fine of AU$100 million. This happened back in December after the Queensland government claimed the operator breached multiple laws. Before that, in NSW, the operator was served with another fine along with the appointment of a special manager.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, now, the operator pleaded guilty to further breaches, this time, related to offering the purchase of gambling chips with credit cards. A statement released by Queensland Government’s Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, Shannon Fentiman, claimed that the operator pleaded guilty to breaching the regulations by allowing the use of credit cards for gambling chip purchases.</p>
<p>Operator Admits to Multiple Breaches</p>
<p>The breaches for which The Star Entertainment pleaded guilty were a total of seven. The Minister for Justice revealed that the charges related to a breach of the Casino Control Act of 1982, Section 66. Under this section of the gambling act, the purchase of gambling chips via a credit card is prohibited.</p>
<p>“Star Entertainment, operators of Brisbane’s Treasury Casino and the Star Gold Coast, has pleaded guilty to seven charges under the Casino Control Act 1982. Attorney-General and Minister for Justice Shannon Fentiman said the charges related to Section 66 of the Act which prohibits the purchase of gambling chips with a credit card,“ reads a statement released by the Queensland government</p>
<p>According to the latest announcement, The Star Entertainment’s operators, the Star Gold Coast and Brisbane’s Treasury casino admitted to the breaches. The breaches of the regulations occurred within two different time periods: between June 2, 2017, and December 29, 2018, as well as between March 23, 2022, and April 2, 2022.</p>
<p>In its statement, the Queensland government noted that it remains committed to ensuring that all gambling companies operate in line with the existing regulations. At the same time, the government authorities noted that casino operators need to adhere to the highest standards of integrity to ensure the trust of the public. Although the guilty plea was announced Monday, the sentencing is set for June 2, 2023.</p>
