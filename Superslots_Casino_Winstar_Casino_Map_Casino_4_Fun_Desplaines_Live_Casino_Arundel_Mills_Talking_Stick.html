<p>5 Lions Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>5 Lions Megaways has an East Asian theme with an animal twist.</p>
<p>The setting is a festive world filled with turtles, fish, dragons, and, of course, lions. The reels are adorned with golden accents and players will have no doubt they’ve entered a fantasy realm.</p>
<p>This slot is a good pick for players looking for an exotic escape. The wild inhabitants of the game add extra appeal.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A classical Chinese tune plays in the background, filled with chimes and mysterious string notes. This ensures that players feel submerged in the foreign setting.</p>
<p>The animation quality is attractive, and each of the featured animals is designed with an East Asian aesthetic. The creatures often appear to be made of gold and accented with jewel tones. This adds to the fantasy nature of the world.</p>
<p>The fish symbol is especially detailed with sapphire scales and golden fins. The fierce dragon has a friendly smile as his ruby-hued beard flows around him.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are framed in gold, while behind them, a blue fantasy sea churns with waves. The effect seems like a mural one might find in a long-forgotten palace.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music create an environment that is both magical and distinctly East Asian.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>5 Lions Me Megaways uses the Megaways system, which means that the number of symbols on the reels is randomised for each spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols starting from the leftmost reel and moving towards the rightmost reel.</p>
<p>The cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations will vanish from the reels, allowing new symbols to fall down from above.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. The Wild symbol only appears on reels 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>The Wild Multiplier feature means that whenever a Wild is part of a winning combination, it will receive a random multiplier. This multiplier is then applied to the winning combination that is using the Wild. The multiplier may be x1, x2, x3, x5, x8, x10, x15, x30, or x40.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. While in the Free Spins feature, the Bonus symbol will not vanish during cascade sequences.</p>
<p>Before the Free Spins feature begins, players will have the opportunity to select one of seven options for the style of the feature. They may choose from a range that pairs higher numbers of free spins with lower multipliers, and lower numbers of free spins with higher multipliers. This allows players to have control of how much risk they would like to play with.</p>
<p>If players prefer, they may also opt for the mystery option which will make the selection of free spins and multipliers for them.</p>
<p>Players can re-trigger the feature by landing 3 or more Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.5%, nicely above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Eastern-themed slot.</p>
<p>With robust RTP and strategy-friendly volatility, there’s a lot for savvy players to love about 5 Lions Megaways. The attractive animation and whimsically exotic theme make this slot a fun place to spend time as well.</p>
