<p>Daily fantasy sports and betting operator DraftKings announced today a new strategic partnership with the National Football League (NFL) franchise Philadelphia Eagles. According to the terms of the multi-year deal, DraftKings will be the Official Daily Fantasy Sports Partner and Official Sports Betting Partner of the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Naming Rights</p>
<p>DraftKings will also be granted exclusive naming rights to a premium lounge at Lincoln Financial Field, which will be called “The DraftKings Field Club” and will offer VIP experience during game days. The premium lounge at the Eagles’ stadium provides an on-field viewing area in the north end zone, hospitality arrangements in the space of the private club, as well as other benefits, and once the audience is allowed back to Lincoln Financial Field, the DraftKings Field Club will start admitting ticketed guests.</p>
<p>“Philadelphia is home to some of the most passionate football fans, and we could not be more excited to join forces with the Eagles. Be it fans at home, on the DraftKings mobile app, or inside Lincoln Financial Field, we look forward to introducing Eagles fans and DraftKings customers alike to an all-encompassing DraftKings experience.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>Digital Branding Presence</p>
<p>Besides the naming rights to the field club, DraftKings’ branding will feature throughout a number of the social media channels and digital assets for the team from the NFL, including livestreams for practice, branding during in-game, video boards and signage at the stadium. Broadcasting from Philadelphia Eagles’ affiliates will also have strong presence for the DraftKings brand and the team’s annual NFL Draft Party will have DraftKings sponsorship activations.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with DraftKings presents many new and exciting opportunities that will help drive the fan experience at Lincoln Financial Field to the next level. DraftKings has established itself as an emerging leader in the sports and entertainment space with an already strong presence in Philadelphia. We look forward to a successful future with DraftKings and showcasing the value of our shared vision in fun and engaging ways for our fans.” Catherine Carlson, Senior Vice President, Revenue and Strategy, Philadelphia Eagles</p>
<p>As part of the partnership deal, DraftKings will deliver a new free-to-play game, Eagles Stat Showdown, which will offer fans of the NFL outfit the chance to win prizes on a weekly basis throughout the season of the professional football league.</p>
<p>Recent Partnership Deals</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles is not the first NFL team DraftKings becomes an Official Betting Partner for, as last month the Boston-based sports book provider signed a similar deal with the New York Giants and became an Official Sports Betting, iGaming and Daily Fantasy Operator for the franchise.</p>
<p>And DraftKings is not the only gaming operator busy signing partnership deals with franchises from the NFL. In September, Australian-based operator PointsBet became an official sports betting partner for Indianapolis Colts, and BetMGM, the sports betting brand of Roar Digital, signed with the Las Vegas Raiders and the Tennessee Titans.</p>
