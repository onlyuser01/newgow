    <h1>Council Bluffs Casino Hotel True Fortune Casino Free Spin Casino 100 No Deposit Bonus Codes Cosmopol</h1>

<p>A company with a strong customer base is bound to have dormant accounts. When this happens, it’s down to retention and reactivation specialists to step in and do their magic. To ensure that it has the best shot at driving the strongest results, Resorts Digital, the digital arm of Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, has turned to Enteractive.</p>
<p>Enteractive for its part is a proven leader in player reactivation and retention across both the iGaming and sports betting verticals, making it an important partner to Resorts Digital as the company seeks to secure a greater foothold in New Jersey. Enteractive uses a number of solutions to make it possible for clients to engage again with their dormant customers, including the (Re)Activation Cloud platform which is purpose-built for the task.</p>
<p>Enteractive will focus on registered non-funded player accounts (RNFs) to ensure that players are engaged, and that lapsed players come back. The company also will be able to utilize Resorts’ own CRM activities to drive engagement while also observing responsible gambling practices and ensuring that players who come back out of their own volition and are aware of how to play safely.</p>
<p>The company also has some serious hard data to back up its commitment to driving excellent opportunities for players. Enteractive engaged with more than 6.5m players in 2022 alone, and it has been able to generate more than €51m for its global partners, demonstrating its value in not just the United States, but well beyond.</p>
<p>Resorts CEO Ed Andrewes welcomed this opportunity and hailed the chance to see his company work with a proven industry leader in this specific sector. He said that Enteractive brought innovative player engagement strategies. "We’re excited to see the positive outcomes of this joint effort.," Andrewes concluded.</p>
<p>The news was naturally well-received by Enteractive Chief Business Development Andrew Foster who said that his company is continuously seeking to make it easier for iGaming companies and players to carry out meaningful and impactful, mutually-beneficial one-on-one interactions.</p>
<p>"With the aid of our highly skilled team of local US call agents, we are certain that Resorts can increase their results in player conversions and reactivations," Foster assured, confident in the successful collaboration between Resorts Digital and Enteractive. He noted that brands that are serious about improving their players’ experience would find Enteractive to indeed be the right choice down the line.</p>
