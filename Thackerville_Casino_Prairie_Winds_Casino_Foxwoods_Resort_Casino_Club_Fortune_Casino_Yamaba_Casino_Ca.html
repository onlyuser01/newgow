    <h1>Thackerville Casino Prairie Winds Casino Foxwoods Resort Casino Club Fortune Casino Yamaba Casino Ca</h1>

<p>Dear lucasyubi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your issue.</p>
<p>Is this the website of the casino you're complaining about? https://casinozeus.vip/</p>
<p>I have thoroughly reviewed your case and watched several videos from the streamers advertising the platform Casino Zeus.</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that you have most likely fallen victim to a fraudulent scheme. Our investigation of Casino Zeus has led us to the conclusion that it is highly likely a scam casino.</p>
<p>In reputable and licensed casinos, players are expected to register their own accounts without third-party assistance. It is imperative to emphasize that you should never share your personal information or send money to anyone claiming to deposit on your behalf in a casino.</p>
<p>To assist you further in avoiding such situations in the future, we have compiled an informative article on how to choose a secure online casino. You can find it here: https://casino.guru/how-to-choose-an-online-casino</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm if you made any successful withdrawals from this casino in the past?</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that in virtually any online gambling establishment, the player is allowed to have only one account. You mention that you have two accounts in this casino. Are both of these accounts verified?</p>
<p>Have you accumulated your winnings with or without an active bonus?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
