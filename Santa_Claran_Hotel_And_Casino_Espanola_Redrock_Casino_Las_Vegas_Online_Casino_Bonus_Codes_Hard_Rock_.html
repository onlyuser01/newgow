<p>IGaming and online cryptocurrency bookmaker Stake.com has unveiled an update of its displayed branding for the game between Watford FC and Chelsea FC.</p>
<p>The move is a way for Stake.com to show support to the LGBT+ movement and support the Premier League Rainbow Laces campaign – a campaign by Stonewall, whose goal is to make sports available to everyone.</p>
<p>The update will see Stake.com, a major sponsor of Watford FC, collaborate with the team and the Proud Hornets LGBT+ fan club. The change will include implementing the movement’s rainbow in advertisement across the whole Vicarage Road stadium, including the LED screens, attesting to the parties’ commitment to inclusivity.</p>
<p>The sponsorships manager of Stake.com, Dominic Rae, spoke about his company’s devotion to representing and supporting marginalized groups. Rae said that Stake.com’s philosophy is that football, as a global phenomenon, should be available to anyone and every person should be able to enjoy being a part of the community.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to support the Premier League and Stonewall’s campaign by updating our sponsorship assets at Vicarage Road for the visit of Chelsea,” Rae said.</p>
<p>Paul O’Brien, the commercial director of Watford FC, revealed that the football club is just as proud to work with Stake.com for the Rainbow Lace activities and to support the LGBT+ community. O’Brien explained that Watford FC takes pride in its equality and diversity activities and is delighted to see that the club’s principal sponsor has taken Stonewall’s campaign to heart.</p>
<p>Richard Masters, the chief executive officer of the Premier League, UK’s top football league, also showed that he isn’t indifferent to the cause by commenting on the cause. For him, football is a sport that has the power of bridging the differences between people and uniting everyone around a common passion. Therefore, Masters is firm that inclusivity and ensuring that every fan and player feels welcomed and supported are on the top of the Premier League’s list of priorities. Masters added:</p>
<p>“We and our clubs play an important role in encouraging people to support the LGBTQ+ community. During the Rainbow Laces campaign, we showcase the wide variety of projects and initiatives being conducted all year round to highlight that equality and inclusion are central to everything we do.”</p>
<p>Stake.com is currently in the first season of its collaboration with Watford FC as the team’s principal sponsor but this isn’t the first conjoined activation the crypto betting platform and the football club have done together. Previously the two parties have collaborated on a deal that saw the Dogecoin logo on the Watford players’ jerseys.</p>
