<p>The Denver Broncos vs. Detroit Lions is the Week 15 Saturday Night Football game. It’s taking place at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, on December 16</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions’ superb run ended a few weeks ago. They lost two of their last three games, even though they were the betting favorites in all of those games. They’re favored to beat the Denver Broncos in Week 15, are they going to fail again?</p>
<p>They have every reason to worry about Sunday’s game, particularly because they’re without a win over the Broncos in more than 12 years.</p>

<p>Denver Broncos Determined to Keep the Good Run Going</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, the Denver Broncos are now playing well. They’re 7-6 overall, with six wins in their last seven games. The only loss they suffered during that period happened in their first game of December when we saw them lose by just five points to the Houston Texans on the road.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, however, they destroyed the Los Angeles Chargers in California. The final score was 24-7 for the visiting team, in a game in which the Chargers were three-point favorites.</p>
<p>Now, they’re seen as four-point underdogs in Week 15. However, their form is good, and they have a very good record against the Lions. To be fair, though, Detroit’s roster has changed a lot since their most recent loss to the Broncos, back in 2021.</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Determined to Get Back to Their Winning Ways ASAP</p>
<p>In their final game of November, the Detroit Lions lost to the Green Bay Packers 29-22 at home. Many people thought of the loss as a glitch, especially after the Lions beat the New Orleans Saints 33-28 on the road in the following game.</p>
<p>However, last weekend, they failed again. They lost 28-13 to the Chicago Bears on Soldier Field last Sunday. Their quarterback Jared Goff had a horrible afternoon in Illinois, getting a passer rating of just 54.6. It was his worst rating since 2020.</p>
<p>It was bad, but this guy definitely has the skill set to do much better this coming weekend. Unfortunately for him and his offensive teammates, they’re playing against a very good defense in Week 16. The Broncos’ defense has been great as of lately, which is bad news for the Lions who tend to do poorly against such teams.</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that the Denver Broncos vs. Detroit Lions Week 15 games is going to be a real thriller. We do believe that the hosts are a better team, which is why they should be able to win.</p>
<p>However, we can’t say for certain that they’re going to cover the spread. In fact, we think the best bet for Sunday’s game is Denver (+4.0).</p>
<p>Pick: Denver Broncos +4.0 (-110)</p>
