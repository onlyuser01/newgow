<p>The Seattle Seahawks vs. Arizona Cardinals Week 18 game is crucial for the visitors who need a win at State Farm Stadium for a chance to book a place in the playoffs</p>
<p>Even with a win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks might not book a ticket to the playoffs. Their playoff future depends on other teams as well. On the bright side for them is that the Cards don’t have much to fight for in the Week 18 game. No matter what happens, they will not get to the postseason.</p>

<p>Seattle Seahawks Going for a Win No Matter What</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks need to win this game, and then hope that their rivals for a spot in the postseason are all going to fail. It seems unlikely that all the pieces will fall into place for them, but you can be 100% certain that they’re going to give their best shot.</p>
<p>In fact, they have no other option but to go all-in on Sunday and try to beat the Cardinals. That shouldn’t be too hard as they’ve already done it once this season. They beat them 20-10 in October.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the Cardinals were without their starting quarterback Kyler Murray in that game, however, he was on the team in the three Seahawks vs. Cardinals games before that, all of which were won by Pete Carroll’s men.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals to Give Their Best Shot in Week 18 Despite Everything</p>
<p>The Cardinals are 4-12 on the season, with one of those four wins happening last weekend against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philly. They beat last season’s NFC champions 35-31, thus basically crushing their dream of winning the No. 1 seed.</p>
<p>This was, by far, the best performance of the Cardinals in the 2023-24 NFL season, as well as their highest-scoring game since October 2022. The win has certainly given them a massive confidence boost for the Week 18 game, which is played on their turf.</p>
<p>They’re probably going to give all they’ve got on Sunday in order to put on a season-ending show for their fans.</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks vs. Arizona Cardinals Prediction</p>
<p>We predict that this is going to be a very interesting game. Even though the Cardinals have no major incentive in this game, we think they’re going to give the Seahawks a real war on Sunday.</p>
<p>We do, however, think Pete Carroll will find a way to outsmart them, which is why our pick is Seattle. However, we can’t say we’re 100% confident the Seahawks are going to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Seattle Seahawks</p>
