<p>Earlier this year, the leading business-to-business (B2B) gaming content supplier, Push Gaming, announced its debut in the regulated gambling market in Italy. The entry marked an important milestone for the company on its path to expanding further in Europe. Now, Push Gaming announced another strategic market entry, this time, in Greece.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the company revealed that it has expanded its global footprint to Greece via a new partnership with Kaizen Gaming, the largest gambling operator within the regulated market in Greece. Currently, Kaizen operates the renowned brand Stoiximan, which will benefit from games supplied by Push Gaming.</p>
<p>Per the terms of the new exclusive deal, Stoiximan’s players will be able to tap into games from the leading iGaming content supplier, including recent hits such as Rat King and Razor Shark. In addition to recent titles, the operator’s clients will be able to experience classic games from Push Gaming, including Jammin’ Jars, among others.</p>
<p>Besides growing its presence in Europe, the entry in Italy complements the company’s global expansion plans. The Greek market entry comes on the heels of multiple high-profile deals signed by Push Gaming recently with operators like bet365 and Betway.</p>
<p>Vangelis Dedoulis, Kaizen Gaming’s director of product, gaming and rewards, spoke about the high-quality games Push Gaming delivers, acknowledging that they bring thrills to players across the globe. Finally, he pointed out: “We are delighted to be the first operator delivering Push Gaming’s titles to our player base in Greece, enhancing our content with their numerous hits and ensuring a rich array of entertainment is available to our customers.”</p>
<p>The iGaming Content Provider Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, Push Gaming’s director of new business and markets, shared the excitement of Dedoulis. She said that the company’s entry in Greece marks an important achievement and follows its debut in Italy. Hickey said that it is thrilling to see Push Gaming team up with one of the largest operators in the country.</p>
<p>Push Gaming’s director of new business and markets added that the company will be delighted to see its games deliver entertaining and engaging experiences for Greek players. Finally, Hickey said that Push Gaming is looking forward to expanding its presence in the region further by delivering its quality games to more operators.</p>
<p>Late last month, the company confirmed the release of Goat Getter, its latest pay-anywhere slot game. The release of the slot game that features a max win of 10,000x and brings rewarding features follows the launch of the retro-themed slot, Rat King.</p>
