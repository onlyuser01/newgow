<p>Dear pipiag680,</p>
<p>Again, I understand your dissatisfaction with the casino team's approach to handling your issue. I can agree with you that the casino team could have handled the whole situation much better, but I'm not quite sure what else, apart from helping you with the casino paying you your funds, you expect us to do? The casino review update was done recently, and according to our review and rating process, JeetCity Casino has received an above-average safety index. If you want to learn about our casino review and rating process, feel free to check it out here: Learn About Our Casino Review and Rating Process | Casino Guru. It is, of course, your right to disagree with our rating, but we take into consideration various factors, not just your negative experience. This complaint will remain public like any other complaint on our webpage so that other players can read about your negative experience if that is what you want. If you believe the casino has breached its own terms and conditions, feel free to submit a complaint to the casino licensing authority, which is the Cura√ßao/Antillephone Gaming Authority (complaints@gaminglicences.com or certria@gaminglicences.com)</p>
<p>The casino team has processed your withdrawal, and you will receive the $600 shortly, so I believe the main issue has been solved. I understand this might be, in your opinion, just partial satisfaction. As you have been dissatisfied with JeetCity Casino, I would suggest that once you receive the funds, you just simply do not play there anymore and find a casino that will suit you better. There are a lot of other online casinos, and I'm sure you will be able to find a better one from our recommended casinos list. Even if not, just make sure to check the reviews of any casino and play in licensed, good-rated casinos to minimize your disappointment like this in the future.</p>
<p>With all this being said, is there anything else I can assist you with, or can we consider your complaint to be resolved once you receive the funds?</p>
