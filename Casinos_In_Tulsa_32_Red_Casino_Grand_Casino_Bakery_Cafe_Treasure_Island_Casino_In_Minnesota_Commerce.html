    <h1>Casinos In Tulsa 32 Red Casino Grand Casino Bakery Cafe Treasure Island Casino In Minnesota Commerce</h1>

<p>If I was able to log in I would be able to see a cancel button next to my withdrawal, since you permanently banned me and I have no access to the account to check it my self and only point of contact are you here, I will put it in simple question, if I was able to log in and look into my withdrawals would the cancel button still be there next to this withdrawal that I am waiting on?</p>
<p>simple question man, all i want is my money you can post whole conversation I did nothing bad, I was a little extra from time to time but I did give you guys 38k i just a bit over a year, so If asking for extra is a sin so be it.</p>
<p>Also they are being extremly rude towards me over email as I am telling them every previous bank international transfer that i done on my online account once they process it I get it within next 24 hours, now being end of the week and having to wait for weekend and monday is public holidays and right now they keep saying to me its been processed and I cant check it my self as i dont have access to the account anymore, so you cant win here with them.</p>
<p>Also I will adress the issue with me using bad language and it was only done and used once you people tried to make me not get my winnings, you can go on and on about postcode as I previously explained I done nothing different to everyother time but input the amount i wanted to take out. Now they are saying how I got someone feeling bad which wasnt my intention but regarding that email, they keep tellling me that my next date available for me to withdraw money was 29th UTC which is 9 days after I gotten paid by them cause i got paid on 21st. So they tried to tell me that i dont even have a right to perform a withdrawal until 9 days later after they have told you on here I was eligable to make the request and it will be done asap, I didnt input any informations different than last week, if rules changed in past 7 days and you decided to do in dept investigation thats not on me I got paid with those same details every other time.</p>
<p>And all the bad emails that you can post about me using bad language is from this withdrawal that you people are trying to scam me of winning. Why not upload to them a full converastion from the start so they can make decision, not post 2 out of 1000 emails where I used bad words towards stuff once they tried so hard to not pay me out my winings.</p>
<p>I will use this space to appologise to Rebecca as I didnt have no bad intentions towards any one personally but I was getting ripped off and with the way they were responding to me I had to take it else wereee, Gurucasino if you guys need the whole conversation between us so you can see what kind of person I am I am more than happy to provide EVERYTHING not just what suits me, thank you.</p>
<p>I just want to know if the payment has been made, not that I will get it within 1-10 bussines days, because I only need to wait 24 hours once cancel button disappears , thats all I want to know, Thank you</p>
