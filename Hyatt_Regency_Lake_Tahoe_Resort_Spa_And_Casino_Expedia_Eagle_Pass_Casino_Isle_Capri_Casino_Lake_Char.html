<p>Dear Dominik,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply. I have checked the T&amp;Cs on the website and this is what I found in "Bonus Policy" section: "If a bet, regardless of the game, violates our system and the rules, it will be considered invalid. We reserve the right to deduct amounts from winnings if the player has placed single bets higher than € 4 or € 0.50 per line, or 15 percent of the bonus amount before the wagering requirements have been met. If a player deposits via Skrill or Neteller and made single bets of € 2.50 or higher with the bonus amount before the wagering requirements for the bonus were met, we reserve the right to withdraw amounts in excess of the player's original deposit, exclude from payment."</p>
<p>I didn’t find any similar rule for a regular play. Please could you confirm for me that your winnings didn’t originate from a bonus play? I will then contact the casino and ask them for a standpoint. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
