<p>12 licenses issued to Indiana future sports betting venues</p>
<p>The permits to be treated as a test to gauge readiness of individual operators</p>
<p>Indiana also renews DFS betting licenses for three companies</p>
<p>Indiana is giving pre-approved casinos and off-track betting properties temporary permits to test their sports betting offers. This may decide whether the properties get a full license for the September 1 launch of the industry in the state.</p>
<p>Indiana Issues Provisional Permits to Casinos and OTBs</p>
<p>Indiana is inching closer to the start of its sports betting industry later on this year, with the state just releasing 12 temporary licenses. The permits will be handed to casinos and off-tracking betting (OTB) venues as a test before the industry’s official launch arrives.</p>
<p>The “licence” or permit that Indiana issued is known as “Temporary Certificate of Authority” and is given to entities that have already applied successfully for a license but have to wait for their licenses to be processed.</p>
<p>However, with the TCA’s, betting companies will be able to start accepting wagers. At the same time, the state may decide not to renege on a license depending on how these venues handle themselves. In a sense, the permits are both an opportunity to start accepting wagers ahead of time as well as a trial of passage.</p>
<p>The properties that will enjoy the temporary benefits of placing a wager include four Caesars Entertainment casinos including the Caesars Riverboat Casino, Harrah’s Hoosier Park, Horseshoe Hammond, Indiana Grand Racing &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Other names on the list of operators who have got the temporary go-ahead include:</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming’s Ameristar Casino East Chicago</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming’s Belterra Casino Resort</p>
<p>Blue Chip Casino</p>
<p>French Lick Resort</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino owned by the Indian Gaming Company</p>
<p>A number of OTB have also been given the go ahead, including Harrah’s Hoosier Park’s Winner’s Circle and New Haven. They will be joining another OTB in Clarksville.</p>
<p>Indiana’s Sports Betting Details</p>
<p>Indiana has beat New Hampshire to the punch with Governor Eric Holcomb signing sports betting into law in May, 2019. The industry is expected to launch as early as September 1 with all betting agencies approved for a license meeting a 9.50% tax on their gross revenue.</p>
<p>Initial fees cost $100,000 which is one of the lowest rates in the United States. Meanwhile, Indiana is working on developing a reliable framework to regulate sports betting in the state. Presently, a special Gambling Commission is accepting proposals from experts, shareholders and members of the public.</p>
<p>All proposals may be submitted by August 1 and will then be put up for a debate on August 28 when the Commission convenes. While mainstream sports betting is shaping up well in the state, Indiana has decided to allow its daily fantasy sports (DFS) operators to have their licenses renewed.</p>
<p>The move will allow DraftKings, FanDuel and FantasyDraft to continue and legally offer their product in the state.</p>
