<p>Mammoth Gold Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Mammoth Gold Megaways transports players back in time to the ice-age.</p>
<p>As players navigate the snowy terrain, they’ll meet a range of prehistoric creatures, most notably the mammoth. Surviving the bitter cold isn’t easy, but precious gems await those who can make it through the day.</p>
<p>This slot is a great find for animal lovers and those with an interest in natural history.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack blends an ethereal melody with drumbeats and the calls of animals. The trumpeting cry of a mammoth and the squawk of birds create an immersive natural atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the reels, a range of prehistoric animals are animated in vivid detail. Bears, wolves, boars, and the ill-fated dodo all make an appearance. A particularly fierce saber-toothed cat glares out from his reel, looking ready to pounce.</p>
<p>The mammoth is the most iconic symbol, with his trunk extended towards the player and his fur catching the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, a snow-covered landscape with intimidating mountains in the distance is visible. The sky is lilac purple, suggesting the last moments of sunset.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create an imaginative ice-age world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Mammoth Gold Megaways uses the Megaways system, varying the size and number of symbols that appear on the reels during each spin. Reels 2, 3, and 4 may have as many as 6 symbols, while reels 1 and 6 may have as many as 7 symbols.</p>
<p>A separate reel above reels 2-5 spins independently from the other reels.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels. Wins are calculated from the leftmost reel towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>In total, there are 117,649 win ways.</p>
<p>The Tumble feature means that winning symbols will disappear to make way for new symbols to fall into their place.</p>
<p>The maximum win for this slot is 10,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol. Wild symbols have an associated multiplier of 2x or 3x whenever they land. This multiplier is applied to any wins of a Tumble sequence and is collected in a meter. If new Wilds land during the sequence, their multiplier values multiply the collected multipliers.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land 3 or more Bonus symbols. The number of free spins awarded is chosen at random from a predetermined set depending on how many Bonus symbols triggered the feature. The lowest number of free spins that can be awarded is 5 and the highest is 14.</p>
<p>If the number of spins awarded is below 14, players can gamble for a chance to win more free spins, or collect the current number of spins and begin the feature.</p>
<p>Wild multipliers are active during the Free Spin feature with their values collected in the meter. For every Tumble that occurs during the Free Spins round, the win multiplier collected in the meter increases by 1x. The total multiplier in the meter is saved and used for every win during the feature.</p>
<p>Players can win additional free spins by landing at least 2 Bonus symbols, with a greater number of Bonus symbols awarding a greater number of free spins.</p>
<p>Players can buy into the Free Spins feature for 100x their current bet.</p>
