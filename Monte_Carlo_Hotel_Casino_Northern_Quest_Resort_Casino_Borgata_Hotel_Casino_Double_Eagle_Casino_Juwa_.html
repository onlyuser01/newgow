    <h1>Monte Carlo Hotel Casino Northern Quest Resort Casino Borgata Hotel Casino Double Eagle Casino Juwa</h1>

<p>Developer of innovative, top-tier casino games that are changing the way gamers play online Stakelogic and its subsidiary and provider of live casino games, Stakelogic Live, have joined forces to create a highly innovative live casino product. Called Spin-to-Win, the new plug&amp;play live progressive jackpot system reunites the world of live casino gambling with Random Number Generator slots. The fresh system allows for a jackpot to be randomly triggered to players every few minutes. At any given moment in time, any player could trigger the jackpot while engaged in one of the two Mega Money wheels part of the system.</p>
<p>Cash Prizes Ranging From €50 to €1,000</p>
<p>The two Mega Money wheels are placed in a state-of-the-art studio with industrial aesthetics. The first of the two wheels consists of different cash prizes starting at €50 and going up to €1,000 spread across 53 segments.</p>
<p>One of the segments is Red. Whenever a player manages to hit any of the 53 segments except for the Red segment, they receive the matching cash prize for the segment. However, when the Red Jackpot segment is hit, they are redirected to the second wheel. The second Mega Money wheel counts 54 segments and it features one Grand Jackpot, eight Major Jackpots, and 45 Mini Jackpots.</p>
<p>Mini Jackpots start at €1,000 with an average value set at €2,500. The Major Jackpot seeds at €5,000 and reaches an average value of €15,000. The mouth-watering Grand Jackpot starts at €100,000 and can reach €500,000 on average.</p>
<p>The Jackpot contribution has been set for 1% and it will be taken from players’ initial bet. Once a jackpot is triggered, the Video Stream instantly switches to the Stakelogic Live Studio scene, allowing players the chance to win cash prizes or reach the second wheel for higher wins.</p>
<p>Integration With Stakelogic Slots</p>
<p>The new plug&amp;play live progressive jackpot system can be integrated into different slots that are already part of Stakelogic’s portfolio. The company’s chief executive officer Stephan van den Oetelaar proudly spoke about the new system and feature calling them a “major breakthrough”. He also added that the Live casino segment was “already huge” and that growth was set to keep going as planned. Spin-to-Win and Live Progressive Jackpot System will enable casino operators to “tap into this growth” while offering “compelling” gaming experiences to players.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, Stakelogic decided to power bet365’s Dutch offering with its top content while securing a content reach partnership with EveryMatrix.</p>
