    <h1>Harrah S Pennsylvania Casinos Morongo Casino Resort And Spa Casinos In Pennsylvania With Hotels Choc</h1>

<p>Racing-oriented B2B content and production services provider Sports Information Services (SIS) has launched a subsidiary in the United States of America by the name SIS Content Services. This move is a part of SIS’ intentions to reinforce a position on the American market and improve its overall global reach and follows on SIS’ recent deal with RACELAB.</p>
<p>SIS Targets a Wider Market, Starting with the United States</p>
<p>Through the new subsidiary in the US, SIS will offer a full package of real-time data and video feeds, trading services and liability management. These will cover SIS’ full portfolio of over 30,000 horse races, 38,000 greyhound races, and over 100,000 esports tournaments.</p>
<p>Richard Ames, the president of SIS Content Services and chief executive of SIS, spoke on the launch of the new subsidiary. According to him, it’s an important step in making SIS’ offerings global. Ames promises customers full access to the world’s best horse racing content and turnkey technology. He emphasized SIS’ thirty years of distribution experience as an important selling point that will increase the revenues of clients.</p>
<p>“Our offering comes with all the products and services required to satisfy stakeholders across the industry and will add significant value to their own proposition,” Ames said.</p>
<p>The president of SIS Content Services pointed out that when it comes to fixed-odds wagering there will be a short adaptation period until the subsidiary adjusts to the local regulatory rules. Still, Ames believes that there is a “genuine opportunity” for both horseracing stakeholders and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Ames concluded by saying that SIS Content Services’ launch is building on SIS’s commitment to racing both as a sport and as something to bet on.</p>
<p>Fischer Wants to Make Racing Betting Just as Popular as Sports Betting</p>
<p>SIS has a highly reputable portfolio that is sure to benefit all of SIS Content Services’ clients. The B2B provider offers fixed odds distribution for racetrack content. SIS boasts of having over 118 partnerships with racecourses across 16 different countries.</p>
<p>To boost the quality of its offerings even further, SIS Content Services will appoint Michele Fischer, a seasoned veteran in the industry, as a digital sales consultant. Fischer has profound knowledge of the horseracing ecosystem in the United States and will guide SIS Content Services in the new region it is trying to tackle.</p>
<p>Fischer believes that since there has been “an explosion in sports betting in regulated states”, it is finally time to apply the same growth process to horseracing.</p>
<p>“As SIS has demonstrated for decades in the UK and Ireland, and currently in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, it is extremely well-positioned to help operators and racetracks make the most of their racing content,” Fischer pointed out.</p>
<p>She is excited to lead SIS Content Services at a time that offers such favorable opportunities for US horseracing’s growth. With more than 15 years of industry experience, Fischer is sure to offer some valuable help in SIS Content Services’ growth.</p>
