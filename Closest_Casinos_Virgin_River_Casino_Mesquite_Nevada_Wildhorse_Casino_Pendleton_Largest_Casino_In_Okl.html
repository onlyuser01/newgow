    <h1>Closest Casinos Virgin River Casino Mesquite Nevada Wildhorse Casino Pendleton Largest Casino In Okl</h1>

<p>After losing thousands of Euros, I managed to convert 1000€ into real money using a "VIP BONUS", eventually raising it to 1600€. Upon requesting a withdrawal, however, my winnings were removed from my account, supposedly due to a violation of the Terms and Service. It seems I had supposedly exceeded the maximum permitted bet. At no point were the stakes on the slots limited.</p>
<p>In normal casinos, such a bet would not be permitted in the first place. I reached out to my "VIP Manager", who reassured me that I had been reinstated, reminding me to keep bonus amounts in mind for the future.</p>
<p>When I attempted to withdraw the money, every method was employed to discourage me, complicating the process. For instance, I could not make a bank transfer, even though I had deployed this method for my deposit. Only Skrill was available, which has a limit of 400€, and every request for withdrawal needs to be manually applied for. As was to be expected, most of the processing takes a week.</p>
<p>After successfully withdrawing 800€, I was informed that my further request had been cancelled. The stated reason was that I had supposedly violated the rules, and that I could only withdraw the remaining balance if I churned the outstanding amount thirty more times. I have never heard of such an arbitrary excuse before (I have all the progress as evidence). As soon as they realized that I would no longer play in their Scam Casino, they came up with these fabricated conditions, even though I had already cashed out half. The remaining 800€ is still present in my account as real money, but I cannot withdraw it.</p>
<p>In total, I lodged and lost roughly 4000€ with deposit bonuses. According to their logic, each of these deposits must have also "violated the T&amp;Cs", which should give me the right to reclaim this money.</p>
