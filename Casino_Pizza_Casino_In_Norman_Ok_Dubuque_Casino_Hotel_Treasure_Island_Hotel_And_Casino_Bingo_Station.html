<p>Super Bowl 54 won’t be played until February 2, 2020. But that isn’t stopping bettors from placing substantial wagers on NFL teams that aren’t supposed to perform well this season.</p>

<p>Week one of the NFL season officially kicked off Thursday night, with the Green Bay Packers defense beating the Chicago Bears 10-3 in what was a yawner of an opening. More exciting action will take place Sunday, when the rest of the league begins their years.</p>
<p>Fans across the country have high hopes for their teams, and some bettors are putting money on their beliefs in the form of Super Bowl futures. Several are coming on teams that pro football analysts say have little to no chance of winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>Notable Super Bowl Bets</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook says it took a $9,500 wager on the Carolina Panthers winning the Super Bowl on 50/1 odds. The line implies a chance of just 1.96 percent, and the bet would net the gambler $475,000 should it come true.</p>
<p>CG Technology – a mobile sportsbook in Nevada that also operates at The Venetian, Palazzo, and Palms – revealed it took a $2,000 bet on the San Francisco 49ers on 40/1 odds. That would net $80,000.</p>
<p>William Hill printed a $2,000 ticket slip on the Detroit Lions at 100/1 to win the Super Bowl. The wager would return $200,000 should the nearly unthinkable happen.</p>
<p>The PointsBet sportsbook in New Jersey accepted a $1,000 wager on the New York Giants at 100/1 that would net $100,000.</p>
<p>More Sound Wagers</p>
<p>While the long underdogs have gained some betting traction, it’s the favorites that are leading the total amount of money wagered. Two of the most popular teams are the Bears and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>The defending champion New England Patriots are also taking plenty of action. The SuperBook received a $40,000 wager on Tom Brady and company at 6/1 that would net $240,000.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association surveyed 11,001 US adults on their NFL sports betting plans for 2019-20. Asked which team they would place a $25 wager on to win the Super Bowl, 23 percent answered the Patriots.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs open the NFL season with the shortest odds at 5/1. CG said it printed $15,000 and $10,000 bets on the team winning the Super Bowl at 6/1 before lowering the line. Those wagers would respectively net $90,000 and $60,000.</p>
<p>The Patriots trail closely at 6/1. The Bears, New Orleans Saints, and Philadelphia Eagles are next at 12/1. Those Chicago futures aren’t looking nearly as enticing following the team’s slow start last night against Green Bay.</p>
<p>Los Angeles’ Rams and Chargers are at 14/1, and AFC North foes Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns 18/1.</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins have the longest odds at 500/1. Bettors who risk just $10 would net $5,000 on that line.</p>
