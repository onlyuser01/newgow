<p>UK Labour Party Slams Government Over Delayed Decision on FOBTs</p>

<p>The UK opposition Labour Party has attacked the government for dragging its heels on the country’s long-awaited review of fix-odds betting terminals, which will be delayed until at least October.</p>
<p>Tracey Crouch MP denies the FOBT review has been “kicked into the long grass” and claims the delay is all about process. But there are whispers of a serious disagreement between the DCMS and the Treasury on what to do about the controversial machines. (Image: Kent Sports News)</p>
<p>Theresa May’s government has blamed the recent general election for the hold-up, but sources close to the Guardian newspaper believe a squabble has broken out in the corridors of power.</p>
<p>Sources claim a rift has developed between the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which is the department charged with conducting the review, and the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>The Treasury is concerned that if the DCMS messes with machines by reducing the maximum stake, as has been suggested, it will lose hundreds of millions in taxes.</p>
<p>DUP Complications</p>
<p>A recent cross-party review recommended slashing the maximum stake from £100 to £2, a proposal that has the bookmaking industry seriously spooked. While it’s unlikely the Conservative government would choose such a drastic option, at least some kind of reduction is expected.</p>
<p>The Association of British Bookmakers has claimed a drop in stakes could cost some 20,000 jobs and force hundreds of betting shops to close. FOBTs now account for around 50 percent profits for land-based bookmakers and stricter regulation could devastate the land-based betting sector, say bookies.</p>
<p>The government’s task has been further complicated by the a fact that, since the election, it has been forced to climb into bed with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in order to form a majority.</p>
<p>The DUP has been a vocal critic of FOBTs and has called for them to be banned. Meanwhile, opposition parties Labour and the Liberal Democrats both support the reducing the maximum stake to £2.</p>
<p>Delay “a Disgrace”</p>
<p>Some 35,000 machines are installed in betting shops throughout the country and currently allow customers to bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on digital fixed-odds games, typically roulette. Critics have labeled them the “crack cocaine of the high street” and claim they cause gambling addiction and increase crime.</p>
<p>DCMS Minister Tracey Crouch MP, who is overseeing the review, insisted late last week that that it had definitely not been “kicked into the long grass” and that the hold-up was down to the need to follow correct procedures in order to avoid a judicial review of the decision.</p>
<p>“It is a disgrace that the human cost of fixed odds betting terminals appears less important than the tax [pocketed] by the Treasury from gamblers who can ill afford their losses,” said Medway Labour chief Vince Maple on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It is not only vital that the DCMS publishes its review without further delay, but that appropriate legislation to tackle this scourge is not far behind.”</p>
