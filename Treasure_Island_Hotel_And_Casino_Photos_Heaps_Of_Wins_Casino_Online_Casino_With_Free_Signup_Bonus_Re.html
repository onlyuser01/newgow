<p>Mindway AI, a fast-growing software company, has unveiled a new agreement with Doura-Schawohl Consulting. The partnership will see the two companies boost player protection in the United States.</p>
<p>Mindway AI and the consultancy will work together to minimize gambling-related harm in America, pairing Doura-Schawohl Consulting’s knowledge with Mindway’s software excellence. The former firm will leverage its profound understanding of US responsible gambling policies, while the latter will combine neuroscience, artificial intelligence and human psychologist’s expert assessment to tackle harm.</p>
<p>Both parties’ services will be provided to online sportsbooks and iGaming operators across North America and beyond.</p>
<p>Doura-Schawohl is a distinguished consultancy dealing with gambling harm in North America. Its primary goal is spreading awareness of the dangers of harm and advocating for responsible gambling. Thanks to its efforts, the company was awarded a spot on The Hill’s annual list of top lobbyists in 2022 and named as one of the top 100 lobbyists in 2022 and 2021 by the NILE.</p>
<p>“A Great Start of Something Awesome”</p>
<p>Brianne Doura-Schawohl, the consultancy’s founder and chief executive officer, said that she is very excited to join forces with Mindway AI. She said that the two companies will be able to “broaden the horizons” of policymakers in America and further afield, helping to shield vulnerable customers from harm.</p>
<p>The gambling world needs to constantly evolve and modernize, especially in the areas of harm reduction and prevention, and this partnership will merge principles of data science and global policy expertise to benefit the entire industry. Brianne Doura-Schawohl, founder &amp; CEO, Doura-Schawohl Consultancy</p>
<p>Mindway AI’s chief executive, Rasmus Kjaergaard, also commented on the matter. He called the current partnership a “great start of something awesome,” saying that he is looking forward to working with Doura-Schawohl Consulting.</p>
<p>By integrating our services with one of the most reputable gambling industry consultants, influencers, and lobbyists, we provide an efficient, one-stop ramp-up for companies in the US looking to establish a solid safer gambling framework. Rasmus Kjaergaard, CEO, Mindway AI</p>
<p>In April, Mindway AI reinforced its team with two new appointments, welcoming Niamh Gallagher and Stephen Aupy to the company. Gallagher will serve the software specialist as its social media and marketing manager, while Aupy was named as the company’s new business development manager.</p>
<p>Mindaway AI was just named Safer Gambling Supplier of the Year at the 2023 EGR North America Awards. Speaking of the awards, EGR provided various prestigious accolades to a number of respectable companies, such as Sportradar, NeoGames, PointsBet and White Hat Studios, among many others.</p>
