<p>Colombia welcomes Evolution‚Äôs full suite of live casino games as part of a partnership with Zamba.co, owned by Vicca Group and GAMING1.</p>
<p>Evolution Boosts the Live Casino Game Landscape in Colombia</p>
<p>The world‚Äôs leading supplier in live casino solutions, Evolution, has broken ground into the Colombian online gaming market, making for an important addition to the company‚Äôs quickly expanding footprint of live casino games segment across the world.</p>
<p>This builds upon the company‚Äôs clout in the country after Evolution signed another deal with Rush Street for the launch of First Person games in June.</p>
<p>Evolution is the world‚Äôs first supplier that has successfully brokered a live casino games deal with Colombia. As a result, the company will launch its full portfolio of casino and show-style games, managed by professional Spanish-speaking croupiers.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that Evolution has entered the Colombian market as the first Live Casino provider!</p>

<p>The games will debut on Zamba.co, a joint venture between Vicca Group and GAMING1 and be the first taste of live dealer games Colombian players can enjoy legally on their domestic market.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Vicca Group CEO Rodrigo Afanador said that regulatory reforms in Colombia have made it possible for the company to expand into the online live casino sector, while still leveraging the company‚Äôs ‚Äúlong-established leading position in the land-based casino market.‚Äù</p>
<p>Evolution and Vicca Welcome the Alliance</p>
<p>Afanador has said that Evolution is an international online casino gaming partner they can trust, and which offers a broad range of world-class solutions helping the company to enhance Vicca Group‚Äôs own portfolio and add to the already existing selection of GAMING1 products.</p>
<p>Thanks to this tie-up, Zamba.co will position itself as the de facto gaming leader in Colombia, Afanador concluded. Commenting on the partnership, Evolution CEO and CCO Johan Nordstrom had this to say:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are delighted to have entered the Colombian market with Zamba at what is an exciting time. We are confident that our world-class games portfolio is the perfect fit to add to Zamba‚Äôs offering.‚Äù -Evolution CEO &amp; CCO Johan Nordstrom</p>
<p>Nordstrom added that the successful launch of First Person games in Colombia earlier this year had enjoyed quite the success and the new tie-up with Vicca should be no different.</p>
<p>The executive and Evolution remain committed to the Colombian gaming market and are looking forward to launching the company‚Äôs live casino products with new operators. In the meantime, the company has been busy.</p>
<p>Evolution inked a partnership with Wynn for the US market and extended its relationship with Rush Street Interactive by teaming up with BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse in Pennsylvania.</p>
