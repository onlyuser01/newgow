<p>Aristocrat’s Anaxi division has unveiled a new agreement with PENN Interactive. As per the deal, Anaxi will supply PENN’s digital businesses with a variety of Aristocrat games.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Anaxi’s content will become available on PENN Interactive’s iGaming brands, including Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino. As a result, New Jersey customers can already log into their accounts and access some of the best titles Aristocrat has to offer.</p>
<p>Hit titles such as Wild Lepre’coins, Wild Wild Nugget, Miss Kitty, as well as Sun &amp; Moon, are now available to PENN Interactive customers. The world-class titles vary in theme and mechanics, allowing the operator to engage a large variety of players.</p>
<p>Anaxi is Aristocrat’s online real money gaming and customer experience solutions business that was officially launched last year. It is described as a destination where players can enjoy real money iGaming with confidence.</p>
<p>PENN Interactive, on the other hand, is a subsidiary of PENN Entertainment, a leading provider of gaming and sports betting in North America. The Interactive division currently operates three online casino platforms, namely Barstool Casino, available in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and West Virginia, Hollywood Casino, available in Pennsylvania and theScore Bet, available in the Canadian province of Ontario.</p>
<p>Anaxi Is Thrilled to Join Forces with PENN Interactive</p>
<p>Anaxi’s chief operating officer, Cath Burns, commented on the new agreement with PENN Interactive, saying that the partnership will generate extra gaming experiences for the operator’s online players.</p>
<p>Burns noted that Anaxi is thrilled to launch with such a big operator and continue providing engaging experiences to US gamblers.</p>

By bringing our portfolio of Aristocrat classic titles to Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino, as well as PI’s other platforms, we continue to provide innovative entertainment solutions to the gaming industry. Cath Burns, COO, Anaxi</p>
<p>Earlier this year, PENN Interactive made history by becoming the first US operator to secure RG Check accreditation from the Responsible Gambling Council. The check is regarded as one of the most comprehensible gambling accreditation programs ever, making this a significant achievement for the iGaming company.</p>
<p>In other news, Anaxi recently became partners with FanDuel, agreeing to supply the American operator with its gaming content, including games such as including Dolphin Treasure and Wild Ameri’coins.</p>
