<p>The NCPG has added a new trusted partner to ensure that its Internet Compliance Assessment Program (iCAP) meets the highest industry standards</p>
<p>Through a collaboration with SG:certified, the National Council on Problem Gambling will ensure that the certification process for online gambling operators is conducted efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>NCPG and SG:certified Embark on New Partnership</p>
<p>The iCAP is an advanced methodology for assessing operators based on their commitment to player protection in online gambling. This initiative is launched at a time when the US sports betting and iGaming industries are enjoying an unprecedented level of interest and growth with both sectors expanding at a rapid clip.</p>
<p>Thanks to iCAP, players can know that they are playing at operators that meet a number of stringent criteria that guarantee best gambling practices, and at platforms that provide their members of staff with sufficient training and education on how to effectively prevent and intervene in cases of gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>The certification process will benefit from SG:certified’s own platform which is also developed to ensure that it provides operators with the means they need to stay compliant and meet changing regulatory prerequisites as they also actively seek to offer the highest standard of care.</p>
<p>The collaboration pivots on three main points, to wit Efficiency and Precision, Technology and Integration and User-Friendly Interface, all of which will ultimately contribute to making gambling safer.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, SG:certified Senior Safer Gambling Consultant Dr Maris Catania shared her excitement to be collaborating with the NCPG and hailed the council’s decision to seek out SG:certified to facilitate the iCAP certification process. Catania said:</p>
<p>This will help operators stay at the forefront of responsible gambling practices, join the league of iCAP-accredited platforms, and continue their journey towards excellence. SG:certified Senior Safer Gambling Consultant Dr Maris Catania</p>
<p>Making Certification Available to US Operators</p>
<p>NCPG Executive Director Keith Whyte was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that the collaboration with SG:certified would need to facilitate the iCAP assessment process which will ultimately have a positive effect on how the NCPG and operators collaborate on ensuring that businesses are compliant, and more importantly – players are safe.</p>
<p>SG:certified is also an important partner as it will create an enhanced technological approach to the certification process, the partners shared in a press release. SG: certified’s platform now offers the iCAP certification which should make it more accessible to operators in the United States who are already licensed by local regulators.</p>
<p>The NCPG has also been working to actively elevate standards for player protection and responsible gambling in the United States. The council has spearheaded numerous campaigns to protect consumers</p>
