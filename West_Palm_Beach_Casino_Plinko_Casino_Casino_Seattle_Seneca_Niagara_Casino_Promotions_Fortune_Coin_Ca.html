    <h1>West Palm Beach Casino Plinko Casino Casino Seattle Seneca Niagara Casino Promotions Fortune Coin Ca</h1>

<p>Jackpots are every gambler’s dream and the leading sports betting and iGaming operator, BetMGM, continues to award its players with life-changing prizes. Since the start of the year, through this month, the company has awarded close to $75 million in progressive jackpots. A comparison to the $104 million in jackpots awarded through 2022 shows that this year, BetMGM is expecting to shatter its previously set record.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $75 million in progressive jackpots shows the strong presence of slots from Entain, developed and made exclusively available for BetMGM’s Online Casino. In total, some $30.4 million of the total were awarded via Entain’s unique titles, that stand out with thrilling and engaging features.</p>
<p>Currently, BetMGM Online Casino offers more than 1,500 games. Additionally, the operator’s online casino is home to the exclusive jackpot network that connects more than 20 games, including fan favorites like Bison Fury, MGM Grand Millions, Loot’En Khamun and Mirage Mega Magma, among others.</p>
<p>Besides the slots from Entain, titles from leading iGaming industry suppliers, including Light &amp; Wonder, NetEnt and IGT helped deliver more life-changing jackpots for BetMGM’s customers. The total sum of such jackpots for the first half of 2023 hit $44.3 million, BetMGM confirms.</p>

<p>Additional details released by BetMGM reveal that some $18.8 million in jackpot prize money were distributed in Pennsylvania, while New Jersey saw some $23.2 million in jackpot prize money. For the first half of 2023, the highest total of jackpot prize money was distributed in Michigan, a total of $27.4 million.
