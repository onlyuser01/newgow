<p>One of the most globally recognized gaming and entertainment companies that has a presence in more than 70 countries across the globe, Hard Rock International (HRI), continues to expand its European presence by celebrating the groundbreaking for a new integrated resort located in Athens, Greece. The company was joined by GEK TERNA Group and the Athens community last week for a groundbreaking celebration of Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Athens, located in the heart of the Athens Riviera.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking event took place at the historical Hellinikon Airport while the celebratory ceremony was organized at the Hellinikon Experience Center. The exciting event saw the participation of GEK TERNA Group executives, representatives of Hard Rock, local community leaders, as well as political figures and government officials.</p>
<p>The recent groundbreaking ceremony represents the start of the development of Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Athens which is expected to welcome its first visitors in 2027. Besides world-class casino gambling, the resort is expected to offer luxury hotel accommodation, a state-of-the-art entertainment space, a premier meeting and convention area, as well as a wide range of food and beverage options.</p>
<p>George Peristeris, GEK TERNA Group's Chairman and CEO, commented on the topic in a statement. "We are delighted that in cooperation with a world leader in this sector, Hard Rock International, we are realizing an investment much higher than its already significant nominal value, offering Greece a development project that will be a reference point for our country's tourism product internationally, will offer employment to thousands of people and yield significant revenues to the national budget," he explained.</p>
<p>Additionally, Peristeris highlighted the importance of its project and its high domestic value. Finally, GEK TERNA Group's Chairman and CEO outlined that the groundbreaking marks a major step toward the development of the project that is expected to boost tourism and bring economic stimulus.</p>
<p>Jim Allen, Hard Rock International's Chairman, was similarly excited. "Today is a very special day as we celebrate this momentous occasion to bring our unique brand of world-class entertainment to Athens," he added. Finally, Allen said: "We are grateful to all the political leaders, our partners at Gek Terna and the people of Athens for supporting us and this project."</p>
<p>The price tag of the new integrated casino resort is a whopping â‚¬1.5 billion. The project represents the first-of-its-kind venue for continental Europe and strengthens Hard Rock's growing presence on the Old Continent. During the construction, the project is expected to generate some 3,000 jobs. Once completed, Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Athens is expected to impact positively the Greek economy. Moreover, the project is expected to bring economic stimulus to Athens and create 3,000 permanent workplaces.</p>
