<p>US Integrity, a company that specializes in monitoring and detecting fraudulent betting activities and instances match-fixing, has become the latest backer of the American Gaming Association’s "Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly." campaign designed to promote awareness for responsible gambling and help consumers play safely.</p>
<p>US Integrity is already a fixture in the US sports betting market, offering its services to a growing list of clients who are interested to ensure the safety and fairness of their product offers. Now, US Integrity will leverage the Have A Game Plan campaign with these clients and help spread the message across the entirety of North America at a time of rapid expansion for the betting and gambling industry in the region.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, US Integrity President and Founder Matthew Holt welcomed the chance to bolster and amplify AGA’s efforts and message in helping raise awareness for responsible gambling. He stressed the importance of helping educate consumers about the core principles of playing in a safe and sustainable manner, and added that stakeholders had a clear interest in promoting this important cause:</p>
<p>"Responsible gaming education goes hand in hand with our mission to protect consumers and competitions. We look forward to teaming up with the AGA and Have A Game Plan partners across the sports and gaming ecosystem to help advance this important cause."</p>
<p>The campaign follows simple yet established tenets that are reinforced by campaign messages such as AGA’s own initiative. The program in its essence encourages consumers to stick to budgets, understand how odds work, and focus on betting for the sake of entertainment rather than as a path to financial independence or stability.</p>
<p>Above all else, AGA has been a vehement advocate for bringing consumers off the black market and into the regulated and legal market instead. "Protecting customers and competition integrity is core to the success of a sustainable legal marketplace," commented AGA SVP Casey Clark who hailed the arrival of US Integrity to Have A Game Plan.</p>
<p>US Integrity is now joining a collective and ever-expanding effort to make sure that consumers are protected, and understand the principles of responsible gambling. Have A Game Plan has grown extensively over the past years, with numerous stakeholders joining in, amongst which sports organizations, sportsbooks, and leagues.</p>
