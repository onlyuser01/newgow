    <h1>Chukchansi Gold Casino Casinos Near Palm Springs Directions To Parx Casino Winstar Casino Restaurant</h1>

<p>Wagering requirements cleared after receiving no-deposit bonus elsewhere</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>The bonus is arbitrarily reduced (it was close to 20000, but you can withdraw up to 6000, so</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>If you think that it has been reduced, it will suddenly be confiscated in full.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>I received an email saying that the bonus will be confiscated because I made up a fraud that I didn't do.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>Random account closure</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>It's obvious, but I'm fascinated by the management that makes up things that I don't want to do.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>A few days later, I got a shitty reply saying there was no fraud and canceled my account.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>I tried to verify my identity in order to withdraw the bonus amount, but for some reason the button did not respond and I had to send it directly by e-mail. When I hid it again and showed it, for some reason it didn't make sense)</p>
<p>The person's photo is also useless, and no matter how many times they respond to the request of the management side, it is useless (about 10 times</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>Again, if you get angry, you will be authenticated</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>It is said that you can withdraw if you deposit the minimum amount of 2400 yen in Vega Wallet, but even if you try to deposit it, it will come out if it is less than the minimum amount and you can not deposit.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>No matter how many times I e-mail, I am told that I will check with the department in charge, and I keep running away (today is the 3rd day</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>Are other users able to deposit with Vega Wallet? If it's possible, the management side is deliberately not letting me deposit, and if it's not, I ask if it's a server problem, but they ignore it.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>When I asked him to answer the question, he answered that he couldn't tell me about other customers (Naudesu)</p>
<p>(I've been exchanging hundreds of letters for several months in the exchange so far.</p>
<p>I don't want to withdraw money</p>
