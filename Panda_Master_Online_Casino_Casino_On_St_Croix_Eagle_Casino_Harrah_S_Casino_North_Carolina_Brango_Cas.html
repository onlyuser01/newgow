<p>Earlier this week GGPoker announced that a new tournament will start on March 20, featuring a $5 million guaranteed prize pool.</p>
<p>GGMasters Overlay Edition Starts March 20</p>
<p>GGPoker, the leading poker website, announced details on Monday regarding a new tournament set to launch this March. The competition, dubbed GGMasters Overlay Edition has a massive $5 million guaranteed prize pool and is set to launch on March 20, 2022.</p>
<p>The tournament celebrates GGPoker’s GGMasters second anniversary. Moreover, it is labeled as the highest value tournament ever. While all of this sounds well, it is important to mention that the tournament will be in a freezeout-only format. In other words, there won’t be re-buys for players that are eliminated.</p>
<p>The freezeout tournament will feature a $150 buy-in. Overall, there will be three different stages for Asia, Europe and America regions. According to GGPoker, the Asia Flight starts on March 20 at 12 PM UTC, while the Europe Flight starts at 5 PM on the same day. The Flight for Americas will start on March 20 at 10 PM UTC. Finally, the players that successfully pass their first flight will enter into day 2 of the tournament. The GGMasters tournament day 2 starts on Monday, March 21, 2022, at 5 PM UTC.</p>
<p>Exclusive Bonuses and Promotions Await New Users</p>
<p>Besides a $150 buy-in, GGPoker revealed that players can win their seat for only $2 from satellite tournaments starting daily from February 16, 2022. Additionally, GGPoker said that new players can benefit from a special welcome bonus and a “Honeymoon” promotion. What is more, the new players will benefit from automatically joining GGPoker’s loyalty program dubbed Fish Buffet which regularly offers cash prizes.</p>
