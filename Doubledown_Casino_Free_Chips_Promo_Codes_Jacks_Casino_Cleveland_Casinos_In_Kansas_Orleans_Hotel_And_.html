<p>Microgaming is also set to once again back Safer Gambling Week, which will run from Nov 13 to 19</p>
<p>Microgaming, a provider of “legendary online gaming platforms, systems and services,” has demonstrated its support for responsible gambling by backing a number of safer gaming charities.</p>
<p>Microgaming is currently working with organizations such as YGAM, Gordon Moody, Beacon Counselling Trust, Betknowmore UK and Motiv8. The supplier continues to provide such organizations with crucial financial support, helping them expand their services and create educational content.</p>
<p>Thanks to Microgaming’s backing, Ygam was recently able to expand its educational programs. Gordon Moody, meanwhile, used the extra money to provide relief to people affected by harm.</p>
<p>Beacon Counselling Trust used Microgaming’s funding to create an educational animated video that promotes better mental health. Betknowmore UK, on the other hand, modernized its digital platform, adding more safer gambling content and interactive educational materials.</p>
<p>Finally, Motiv8 plans to leverage the money provided to it by Microgaming to reinforce its cost-of-living fund.</p>
<p>Microgaming’s director of compliance, Sarah Campbell, highlighted her team’s commitment, saying that safer gaming and responsible gambling are in Microgaming’s DNA. According to her, the Microgaming team is proud to be working beside so many charities that are making a change by helping those in need.</p>
<p>Microgaming Will Support Safer Gambling Week 2023</p>
<p>Microgaming has been supporting responsible gambling organizations for years. During last year’s Safer Gambling Week, the company saluted its charity partners, thanking them for their invaluable service.</p>
<p>Back then, Microgaming reaffirmed its commitment to responsible gambling, calling Safer Gambling Week “the perfect chance to highlight Responsible Gaming charities that do amazing work in the field of problem gambling treatment and research.”</p>
<p>During Safer Gambling Week charities backed by the supplier extended their thanks to the company, thanking it for its invaluable support.</p>
<p>This year, Microgaming is set to once again back Safer Gambling Week, which is set to run from Nov 13 to 19.</p>
