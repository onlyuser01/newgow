    <h1>Empire Casino New York Casino Age Super Slots Casino Casino In Lake Charles La L Auberge Casino Bett</h1>

<p>GVC Holdings announced today the migration of Ladbrokes to its market-leading proprietary technology platform, which, together with Coral, Gala Bingo, Gala Casino and Gala Spins, successfully completed the list of Ladbrokes Coral brands the group acquired back in 2018.</p>
<p>Remote Work to Complete the Task</p>
<p>The integration of Ladbrokes into the GVC platform is setting a landmark in the gambling industry, being accomplished on time, on budget and without disruption to the accounts moved, despite being the most complex integration process to-date. Furthermore, the final part of the process of moving across of all 25 million Ladbrokes Coral customer accounts, the last 12.5 million of them, GVC is proud to have accomplished while its teams have been working remotely.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that this critical and hugely complex stage of the Ladbrokes Coral integration process has been completed so successfully. It is a great testament to the sophistication of our technology and the quality of our teams, and it is particularly impressive that they have managed to finalise it during this period of remote working. It also positions the business even better to emerge from the current crisis from a position of strength.” Shay Segev, Chief Operational Officer, GVC Holdings</p>
<p>Cost Synergies, More Acquisitions</p>
<p>Having completed the platform migrations on time is followed by back office integrations, putting GVC Holdings on track to achieve the full projected annualized synergies of £130 million by the end of next year, as well as freeing up significant resources technology-wise and allowing for their deployment into product innovation and even acquire new brands where opportunities arise.</p>
<p>“The GVC integration model has proved itself time and again to be extremely effective at integrating large-scale operations with minimal disruption to our underlying business. As a result, we are confident in our ability to take advantage of the attractive M&amp;A opportunities which we believe will present themselves to us in the future while further boosting the growth of our existing business.” Shay Segev, Chief Operational Officer, GVC Holdings</p>
<p>GVC’s Technology Platform is the Key</p>
<p>After the integration of Ladbrokes, its customers can now take full advantage of the capabilities of GVC’s technology platform, which the group considers to be its competitive edge and central to recent strong financial performance. Besides delivering greater efficiencies, speed, product development and customer propositions, the robust proprietary platform allows for regulatory change adaptations ahead of competition. Its extensive range of tools and initiatives helps GVS support and promote a safer gambling environment for its customers.</p>
<p>Recently, the company welcomed the additional guidance issued by the UK Gambling Commission regarding concerns that many vulnerable people may slide back into their bad habits due to the ongoing health crisis situation and related lockdown. Despite finding no evidence for increased problem gambling, GVC hailed the additional emphasis of the regulator on customer protection.</p>
