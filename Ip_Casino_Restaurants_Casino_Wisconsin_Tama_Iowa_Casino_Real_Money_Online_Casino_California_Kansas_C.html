    <h1>Ip Casino Restaurants Casino Wisconsin Tama Iowa Casino Real Money Online Casino California Kansas C</h1>

<p>SInce I started gambling online, in 2014, things seemed less stressful, more wins and hardly any withdrawal disputes.</p>
<p>But as the industry has evolved, and more and more platforms pop up everyday, the fun and excitement that used to be here, I feel is gone.</p>
<p>SInce 2018, I have hit 4, $10,000+ wins (I know it aint life changing but it does change some things) and I have had to fight for 3 of the 4 withdrawals. 1 was justified, 1 wasnt, and my current one still isnt resolved.</p>
<p>But what does a player do when the vendor goes out of there way to intentionally give false information to both KGC &amp; Ecogra??</p>
<p>What happens then?</p>
<p>The vendor knows this process inside and out. After going through both regulators more than once, I seems to me that the vendor can simply tell their verison of the story, and it is taken as they spell it out, regardless of what proof or documentaion a player might have in the 100% valid claim.</p>
<p>How fair and concise can this process possibly be when as a player, you must provide every little detail to successfully have a chance at getting your fairly won cash.</p>
<p>But as a vendor, you just have to tell them something totally different, as its taken as the word of God. With no possibility of this or any other vendor intentionally 'steering a player in the wrong direction' or givng them confusiing or unclear instructions, so that the vendor can discredit the player, invent some deflective reason that misleads, distracts and eventually gets the house the result they want, and saves them from paying out a single dime.</p>
<p>Vendors all know this process and also count on the normal or next step that a regulator will take.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, if any withdrawal came across your desk that you considered a good stack, as a vendor, and if you knew you even played a small part in a player NOT getting his money, if the variance of a week (give or take) on whether or not a regultor was still investigating or not, would you not mislead one, knowing that their next course of action would be to immediately dimsmiss that players claim as invalid?</p>
<p>To absolve yourself of any wrong doing AND to avoid payment to the player all together? You damn rights you would.</p>
<p>Lets be realistic, without naming ANY of these vendors who grab the lions share of the Canadian market anyway, i have dealt with their SupportCenter many times and they LOVE being the deciding or majority vote in whether or not they allow a player to enjoy their winnings or absolutely just stomp their hopeful dreams and thoughts of paying off their car or whatever and think nothing of it. Im sure they all sit around, have chuckle and go for lunch.</p>
<p>ALL VENDORS are not the poster children for fair, just, unbiased dispute resolution. Regardles of their 'status' here or any other gaming community platform and forum.</p>
<p>But whats that you say.....You have every withdraw request transaction#, recorded chats and organized email notifcations and verification requests all dated and timelogged, proving without a doubt that this vendor acted maliciously, unethically and unprofessionally?</p>
<p>Yes! Yes I do!! ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Well, thats too bad because they told us their side and that good enough for us. Therefore we must dismiss your claim as invalid.</p>
<p>Now tell me, is that a fair, just, and ethical dispute resolution process?? In my opinion, it not even close.</p>
<p>if it was fair ( or closer to more fair i should say), it would be as close to real court as possoible. Or at least the notion that, "Its not what you can say or what you heard, ITS WHAT YOU CAN PROVE!"</p>
<p>PS..Im not entirely sure if this post will get approved, but i hope it does because this is the X discussion that is nowhere to be found. It needs to be because it is getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>"Those who KNOW, don't care....</p>
<p>And those who CARE, don't know...."</p>
<p>By the way, how many of you know the REAL benefits of attaining a 'Diamond Status' level in CR Rewards?</p>
<p>Would you believe me if I told you that just because you get to that level, and sure get a cpl hundred in VIP points but the real awesome things they list in the FAQS section, that less than 2% of all players who get there, actually receive those benefits....And you'll never guess HOW they decide who gets them and who doesnt.......</p>
