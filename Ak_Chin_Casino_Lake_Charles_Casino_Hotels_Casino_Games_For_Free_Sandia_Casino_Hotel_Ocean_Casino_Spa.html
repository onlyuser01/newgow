<p>Lucky Reels review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Lucky Reels takes the classic visuals and tone of an old one armed fruit machine and puts them in a new, modern context. The style is glossy and 3D and adds new gameplay mechanics to what was once the purview of the most minimalist machines.</p>
<p>Anyone who has played a few slots will know how they feel about the fruit laden reels of a game like this. If it's your sort of thing, you may wish to look a little closer at this twist on a classic.</p>
<p>Big Win in Wazdan's Lucky Reels slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The choice of symbols is perhaps a little basic, seeing as they are some of the oldest and most common symbols in slot machine history. Diamonds, fruit and lucky sevens adorn the reels in a clean and bright style that has a lot of surface shine.</p>
<p>The animations are simple and do the job of flagging up the action well. A speed option in the game can toggle the spin animations between slow, fast and blink-and-you’ll-miss it.</p>
<p>Wazdan’s stable of highly trained synth-pop composers are on hand to provide the upbeat soundtrack and seem to have been involved in the win and spin sounds which have a delightfully musical tone.</p>
<p>There is however a slightly off-putting male voice that comments "nice" when a multiplier falls and may make a player jump the first time they hear it.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lucky Reels is a six reel slot with three rows and twenty winlines.</p>
<p>The main feature of the base game are the multiplier symbols on the reels, which can land at any time. When they do, all subsequent spins enjoy the benefits of that multiplier until a new multiplier symbol lands and changes the multiplier to something else for the remaining spins.</p>
<p>Even low paying symbols give high enough winnings with x8 multiplier</p>
<p>There is a simple double or nothing gamble feature for players who like a little extra risk. In this game, players must predict the colour of the next card off a deck, a 50-50 proposition.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatters anywhere on the reels triggers a Free Spin bonus. Three scatters win 15 free spins for the player, while four win 20, and five and six win 25 and 30 respectively.</p>
<p>Free spins can be retriggered.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.60%, solidly over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Lucky Reels slot</p>
<p>The volatility of this game can be set to low, medium, or high volatility by clicking a button in the base game. Since our preferred slot strategies target the highest possible volatility, we recommend players go with the highest level of variance in this game.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While the theme may be either a classic or tired and old, depending on the player’s perspective, the design of Lucky Reels is all modern and uses music and animation to help the game feel fresh in spite of everything.</p>
<p>The multipliers in the base game reward persistent players with variety and bonus and gamble games add further changes of pace to keep players interested.</p>
<p>The decent RTP and adjustable volatility are both big pluses in our book. The main question you have to ask yourself before playing is whether you’re a fan of fruit.</p>
