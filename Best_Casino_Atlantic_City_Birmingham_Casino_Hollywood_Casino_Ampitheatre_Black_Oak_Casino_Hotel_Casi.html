<p>Wynn Macau, Limited is introducing some changes as Matthew O. Maddox, the company’s chief executive, threw in the towel on December 31, part of a planned resignation of duties announced in November 2021. Maddox however decided to stay with the Board of Directors until last month, as a non-executive member.</p>
<p>The stepping-down of one of the company’s heavyweight, though, is no reason for gloom, as Wynn Macau has appointed Ellen F. Whittemore as a non-executive director of the company, Macau Business reported.</p>
<p>Her appointment began effective on Sunday, which was the first day of the year, and she has been with Wynn Resorts, Limited long enough to understand the company’s needs and its specific regional focus in Macau. She has been working with Wynn as an EVP and General Counsel Secretary since 2018.</p>
<p>As to Maddox, his decision to step down as CEO of Wynn Resorts and Wynn Macau marks the end of a nearly four-year period under which he steered the business to success. Maddox’s decision to step down did not catch the company unawares, as it has already filled his position with Linda Chen stepping in at the helm as President of Wynn Macau, Limited.</p>
<p>Whittemore has an extensive track record holding senior executive positions. She used to be a shareholder at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP, a US-based lobbying and law company. She was also part of the Whittemore Gaming Group, LLC.</p>
<p>Whittemore is assuming her new responsibilities at a crucial time for the company, as Wynn Macau won a ten-year extension of its concession in the Special Administrative Region. Both Whittemore’s appointment and the new contract became effective on January 1, marking a fresh page for the business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wynn Macau will have to navigate the new realities of the SAR, which include a dynamic COVID-19 situation in which the government has lifted all restrictions, but which has nonetheless suppressed visitors due to the rampaging Omicron sub-variant.</p>
<p>Wynn Macau has been doing well despite all. The company just announced a one-time discretionary allowance payment to all of its employees in the SAR as a token of its appreciation for the hard work members of the team had put in making sure that the company could handle what was one of its hardest operational years.</p>
