<p>Big Time Gaming (BTG), a leading innovator in slot development, has joined forces with Future Anthem, a Game Data Science specialist, to acquire a deeper understanding of player behavior and optimize its game portfolio.</p>
<p>BTG and Future Anthem Partner up to Enhance Gaming Experience</p>
<p>BTG will integrate player behavioral modeling and interactive visualizations for its games through Future Anthem’s Game Data Science platform, Anthemetrics, starting with BTG’s partner, Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>The AI solution by Future Anthem will predict performance and identify optimization opportunities that will be beneficial for partners and their players. Anthemetrics will allow BTG to optimize the gaming experience of its games. BTG recently struck a deal with Microgaming for its proprietor technology, Megaways. The feature will become a part of upcoming Microgaming slots this year.</p>
<p>Nik Robinson, the CEO of Big Time Gaming, said that the integration of Future Anthem’s data would allow the company to optimize its innovative slots even further. He also stated that this is the first step towards future growth in a long-term partnership that aims to provide more benefits and opportunities for its customers and its end-users.</p>
<p>Leigh Nissim, CEO, and Founder of Future Anthem stated they are excited to provide player personalization, optimization, and protection to a leader in the industry such as BTG. He expressed confidence while the partnership will focus on Relax Gaming, more opportunities to work with BTG would be available.</p>
<p>How Does Anthemetrics, the First Game Data Science Platform, Work?</p>
<p>Anthemetrics provides operators and game studios with a simple and coherent way to understand players’ behavior. Its structure allows its partners to see the performance, challenges, and opportunities on all levels – games, players, and markets.</p>
<p>According to Future Anthem, working with data is very important to providing a responsible and entertaining gaming experience. The company’s learning models include analyzing the game data to predict in real-time the player’s behavior. With its AI, Future Anthem goes deep into the games to find patterns and transnational data. The platform provides recommendations, opportunities, and prediction mechanisms. All of these can help boost revenue and create an exciting but also responsible gaming experience.</p>
<p>The first of its kind game data science platform is hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud. Its data doesn’t include sensitive information from the customers, only their player IDs and transactions. Microsoft Azure also stores data analysis and algorithms. Each client’s data remains separate from others. GVC Holding recently partnered up with Future Anthem. The company is utilizing its Anthemetrics technology to enhance its players’ protection by monitoring and detecting harmful behavior.</p>
