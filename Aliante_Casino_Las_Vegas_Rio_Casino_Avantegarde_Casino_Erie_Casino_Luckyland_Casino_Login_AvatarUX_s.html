<p>LooneyPop allowed AvatarUX’s team to explore a new universe while featuring the ZapReel mechanic for the first time, CEO Longmuir said</p>
<p>AvatarUX, an award-winning slots studio, has launched a flashy new game called LooneyPop. What makes this title special is that it is the first slot to feature the studio’s proprietary ZapReel mechanic. AvatarUX is certain that fans are going to love having fun with LooneyPop.</p>
<p>Thematically, the studio’s new game features a mad professor who uses his knowledge to bring monsters to life. Players can collect symbols with various characters and numbers to score a win.</p>
<p>When enjoying LooneyPop, players should have an additional three-cell reel in mind. The extra reel is added by the studio’s proprietary ZapReel mechanic and displays various special rewards and multiplier bonuses.</p>
<p>A game of LooneyPop begins as a fairly familiar 5×3 slot experience. However, the PopWin mechanic makes it so that every time the player scores a winning combination, the symbols pop and are replaced by two more. As a result, the game can turn into a 5×6 slot, providing players with an impressive 118,098 ways to win.</p>
<p>LooneyPop Metrics</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 3-9</p>
<p>Paylines: 118,098</p>
<p>RTP: 96.0%</p>
<p>Max Win: 50,000x</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.20/40</p>
<p>Bonus Buy: Yes</p>
<p>The Free Spins Mode Will Increase Players’ Chances to Win</p>
<p>If the players manage to expand the reels to six symbols, they will automatically trigger the Free Spins bonus game. Players can also purchase bonuses in markets where this is allowed for the price of 125 bets.</p>
<p>Before the Free Spins bonus game, players will go through a gambling round where they would be assigned a number of spins. Then, the reels will start at 5×6, greatly increasing the player’s chances to strike a win.</p>
<p>Each consecutive win increases the multiplier. In addition, during the bonus game, the reels can expand further as the game turns into a 5×9 slot. If the players max out the reels during the bonus game, a 2x multiplier is added.</p>
<p>LooneyPop Allowed AvatarUX to Explore a New Universe</p>
<p>LooneyPop is the latest addition to AvatarUX’s critically-acclaimed portfolio of exciting slot games. It will be exclusively available to partners of the studio with direct integrations and will be rolled out globally later in 2023.</p>
<p>AvatarUX’s chief executive, Nicola Longmuir, commented on the new game, saying that it allowed the studio to explore a whimsy cartoon universe filled with colorful characters while inaugurating the ZapReel mechanic.</p>
<p>We strive to combine bold, immersive mechanics and themes in all our titles, and this is evident once again with LooneyPop™. Last year was a banner one for us, and we can’t wait for fans to see what 2023 has in store. Nicola Longmuir, CEO, AvatarUX</p>
<p>In other news, AvatarUX recently penned an aggregation agreement with Soft2Bet.</p>
