<p>After two failed votes to expel congressman George Santos, the US House of Representatives on Friday successfully ousted him last week Friday. The 311-114 voting last week made the congressman the first lawmaker in the last two decades to be expelled. The voting came amid allegations against Santos as well as scandals that loomed during his time in Congress. The last time a congressman in the US was expelled was more than 20 years ago, back in 2002, when James Traficant, an Ohio Rep. was expelled by the House over violations of the House of ethics rules.</p>
<p>Media reports released earlier this year claimed that Santos lied during his campaign last year. He was criticized for allegedly claiming that he was employed by two leading investment companies that enabled him to become an experienced investor and financier on Wall Street. Moreover, allegations against Santos claimed that he had lied about his family having Jewish heritage.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the House Ethics Committee last month released a report, alleging there was “substantial evidence” against Santos for filing incomplete or false reports with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), engaging in fraudulent conduct and using campaign funds for personal expenditures.</p>
<p>At the time the Committee’s report was released, Santos released a statement via X, formerly Twitter, explaining: “The Committee went to extraordinary lengths to smear myself and my legal team about me not being forthcoming (My legal bills suggest otherwise).” He bashed the allegations deeming them a “disgusting politicized smear that shows the depths of how low our federal government has sunk.” Additionally, Santos wrote: “Everyone who participated in this grave miscarriage of Justice should all be ashamed of themselves.”</p>
<p>Allegations against the Congressman Claim He Misused Campaign Money</p>
<p>The House Ethics Committee’s report alleges Santos used campaign money to fund a lavish lifestyle, including personal expenditures for holidays and casino gambling in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. According to the report, the congressman used campaign money to fund a honeymoon for himself and his husband back in December 2021. At the time, the couple allegedly visited Las Vegas. But a Santos’ staffer confirmed that during that time there were no campaigns scheduled for the congressman.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report alleged Santos used nearly $2,300 in campaign money for a visit to Atlantic City. The alleged trip dated back to July 23 and July 24, 2022. The report cited claims of a former employee of Santos who claimed they were told by him that he liked casino gambling such as roulette and engaged in such activities “often with his husband.”</p>
