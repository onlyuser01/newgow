    <h1>Four Winds Casino South Bend Main Street Station Hotel Casino Tuscany Suites Casinos 7 Clans Casino</h1>

<p>Received the 10% deposit rebate after depositing $600, ($60) as I have done in the past. I won over $6000 after the playthrough as stated.</p>
<p>I have been playing there for 20 years and am a VIP Player. I withdrew and was told that it is Free Money and there was a maximun withdrawal of 10 times the bonus. (I receied a payout of $600 and they took the rest) This is not correct, as when in the past I had won with the 10% rebate I won over $12000 and at the time emailed to ask what the playthrough and max cashout was. I was told by email from James at Inetbet that because it was a deposit bonus and not Free Money there was no max cashout. They are so blatently lying and saying it is Free money. The rules mention everything about Free Money, that does not require a deposit. This 10% rebate requires a deposit or you don't get it. This is such cheating on their part. I can;t beleive they would do this to me after all this time. They have really gone bad in the last couple of years. A real scam casino. They also told me by email that the maximun cashout was $2500 a week and had been this way since 1999. This to is a massive lie, as it was $2500 a day. I have Neteller payments from Inetbet over the years showing this in black and white $2500 every 24 hours when I won large amounts. Someone needs to stop the lying and cheating from this sham casino. I have no one to help me I just have to accept the lying and scamming. How terrible when you are on your own and no one believes you. I noiw they will never pay me, but I need to let people know about the terrible tactics of this rogue casino. It used to be a really good casino. Very sad.</p>
