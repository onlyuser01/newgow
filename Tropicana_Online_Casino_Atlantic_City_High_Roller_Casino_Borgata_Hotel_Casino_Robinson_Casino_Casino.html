<p>Microgaming has completed the sale of its distribution business and online games portfolio to Games Global Limited, a supplier of games for the global casino market.</p>
<p>Important Milestone for Both Companies</p>
<p>Thanks to the tie-up, Games Global is coming in possession of an extensive catalog of games developed by Microgaming and will have access to more than 900 global brands from across the world the acclaimed developer is currently working with. Commenting on this, Microgaming CEO Andrew Clucas said:</p>
<p>It is an exciting milestone for both Microgaming and Games Global, and is the culmination of months of hard work and dedication from teams on both sides. The online gaming industry will undoubtedly present a wealth of opportunities for Games Global, and we wish them the very best for their journey ahead. Microgaming CEO Andrew Clucas</p>
<p>Microgaming will remain committed to building platform systems and services for the leading online gambling brands out there, including Games Global and its own portfolio of customers. Microgaming will remain focused on delivering on the infrastructure necessary to operate some of the world’s strongest gambling brands.</p>
<p>Gaming Sees a New Era Begin</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microgaming will continue to license its dedicated sports betting software to Betway and will continue to improve the solution for other brands. Games Global’s acquisition constitutes a significant move for the company.</p>
<p>It’s represented by a number of high-profile figures in gambling, including CEO Walter Bugno who served a stint with IGT and Lottomatica, and CFO Tim Mickley who worked for Playtech and SafeCharge.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by Bugno who said that through this acquisition Games Global welcomes the beginning of a new era in igaming. He acknowledged the contributions Microgaming has had to the industry and wished it luck in its next chapter of development.</p>
<p>Microgaming announced the deal back in November 2021, with the sale of Quickfire which comprises numerous assets under its roof. Games Global will now have proprietary access to more than 3,000 games and 25 studios, with the new igaming giant surely seeking to continue and expand its current footprint and Microgaming focusing on a different part of business altogether.</p>
