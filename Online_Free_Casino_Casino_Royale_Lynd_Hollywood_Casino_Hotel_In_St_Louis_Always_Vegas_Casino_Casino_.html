    <h1>Online Free Casino Casino Royale Lynd Hollywood Casino Hotel In St Louis Always Vegas Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Thank you for the email and evidence, CampoBet Casino Team.</p>
<p>Dear matti95,</p>
<p>As I mentioned above Betinia Casino and CampoBet Casino are in the same group, so the verification process is done by the same security team for both casinos. We have received strong evidence from the Casino security team to back up their claim as they mentioned above. It is not acceptable in any casino when the players provide forged or tampered documents.</p>
<p>As the casino has mentioned in its T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND OTHER CHECKS</p>
<p>9.3 You must promptly provide us with all of the documents and information we might request, and assist us in conducting our Checks, without undue delay and in any event within thirty (30) days of our request. We may close or limit your account until you provide the requested documents, information and assistance. If you fail to do so to our reasonable satisfaction within the deadline indicated above, we may confiscate your winnings, terminate our business relationship with you, and return the remaining balance of your account to you. We may also withhold any payment to/from your account until the Checks are completed to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>9.5 All the documents you provide to us must be valid and with all details clearly visible. We may request you to provide us with a picture or a recording of you holding the document, perform live interviews or request the documents to be provided as certified copies. We reserve the right to refuse acceptance of any document where we have reasonable doubts as to its validity or discover any evidence of tampering.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are forced to reject this complaint. Sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Michal</p>
