<p>Kid Galahad Comes in as Favorite</p>
<p>It’s definitely not surprising that Kid Galahad is looking to win another bout on Saturday, especially when his upcoming fight is a rematch with Dickens. Galahad is priced at (-350), giving him a fairly good chance of succeeding too, and not least because of his impeccable record.</p>
<p>He has suffered a single loss and fought in 27 bouts so far, concluding 16 of them with a KO. This fight is even more important for him as it will focus on winning the IBF world featherweight championship, which is vacant.</p>
<p>Looking at Galahad’s track record, there are definitely fights that reaffirm his skill and prowess as a boxer. Other than his loss to Warrington, Galahad has not known a single loss. In fact, he went on a 25-winning streak making it one of the longest in the sport.</p>
<p>Galahad has taken out Clary, Berry, and Cayetano. He fought some pretty bad opponents, too, and his career is intertwined with stellar and middling fighters, but it’s how it goes in professional boxing – everyone gets a shot.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, though, Galahad took on some of the weaker competitors, although this is the nature of his category, too.</p>
<p>Galahad vs. Dickens Tale of the Tape</p>
<p>Kid Galahad Jazz Dickens 31 Age 33 5′ 6 ½” Height n/a 67″ Reach n/a 27-1-0 Fights 30-3-0</p>
<p>Jazz Dickens Determined to Win Rematch</p>
<p>Jazz Dickens is priced at (+275) definitely not too bad, and he is riding an eight-win streak after losing to both Ward and Rigondeaux in 2016 and 2017. Even though Dickens has taken boxing at a much slower pace, he has fought some notable boxers, too.</p>
<p>His most recent bouts against Walsh, Wood, and May have been a true test to his mettle and proof that when Dickens wants to, he can really get back to the very top of the sport. However, if he really wants to make up for his loss in fight one, he will have to win the rematch, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Is betting on Dickens a good call here? With Galahad set to win at (-350), it may be a bit of a stretch to back Dickens. Then again, you might want to look into the Totals or Prop Bets for the fight.</p>
