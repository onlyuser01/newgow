    <h1>Hard Rock Hollywood Casino High 5 Casino Free Coins Vegas Gems Sweepstakes Casino No Deposit Bonus G</h1>

<p>BETER has been known for its commitment to the esports vertical. When the company introduced its iFrame betting solution, it wanted to give esports operators a distinct advantage by leveraging the power of a Twitch-like experience and creating a product that communicates with esports players on a visceral level.</p>
<p>But why stop there, BETER asks itself, as it’s now delivering a new statisticswidget that is incorporated into the already powerful iFrame to develop an even more compelling end-product that esports operators and aficionados can benefit from.</p>
<p>The statistics widget offers key information about player performances and match indicators. As it focuses on Dota 2 and CS:GO, the solution is capable to analyze current patch fluctuations in specific team, player, and hero’s win rates. Dota 2 has more than a hundred heroes, each of which has unique abilities and performs differently depending on the game patch.</p>
<p>Now, BETER is able to pull historic datafor the past three months and feed this to the statistics widget and iFrame solution to help esports bettors and business partners make informed decisions. Not only that, but the statistics widget also collects and offers information about lineups, picks, and bans, and more.</p>
<p>BETER is confident that its solutions have already played a contributing role in helping boost overall interest in esports betting products. In the company’s own estimates, operators which use its esports solutions have seen a 30% uptick in the number of esports players who actually venture to place a wager.</p>
<p>Esports has been a watchword in the betting industry. While the segment is generally underestimated by the majority of operators, there has been a lot of momentum building up. Bayes Esports recently became a licensed betting supplier in New Jersey and Colorado and is teaming up with bet365.</p>
<p>Rivalry, a company that started as a fully native esports company has been able to branch out, but it maintains its momentum in the vertical. The operator teamed up with Low6, a gamification specialist, for the 2022 Leagues of LegendsWorld Championships and Dota 2 The International 11.</p>
<p>Parimatch, another betting operator, signed a partnership with esports powerhouse Team Secret, becoming the team’s official betting partner. While esports betting is generally associated with a smaller handle per bet, players are keen to continue participating especially now that there are more opportunities to introduce esports aficionados to great esports betting operators that understand them well.</p>
