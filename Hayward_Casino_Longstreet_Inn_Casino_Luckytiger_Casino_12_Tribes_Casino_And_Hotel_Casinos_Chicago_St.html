<p>While employees of Detroit's two other casinos accepted a proposed gaming contract earlier this month, the strike and negotiations for MGM Grand's employees continue</p>
<p>Last month, unionized casino workers at Detroit’s three casinos, MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino and Hollywood Casino at Greektown, launched a strike. The move came at a time when the workers asked for better working conditions, including pay raises, job security and workload reduction. The strike saw 3,700 casino workers, including dealers, housekeepers and other employees protest for more than a month.</p>
<p>On Sunday, November 19, 2023, the strike for Hollywood Casino at Greektown and MotorCity Casino employees ended. At the time, the Detroit Casino Council (DCC), representing the workers, confirmed that the employees of the two casinos had voted and ratified the new contract “with historic wage increases and other gains.”</p>
<p>Despite their decision, MGM Grand Casino employees who voted on the same contract turned it down. As a result, now, more than a week later, the strike for MGM Grand’s casino employees continues. As announced by Click on Detroit, unions confirmed Wednesday that they are “back at the negotiation table” with MGM Grand Casino.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the workers at MGM Grand filed a new proposal to the operator on Wednesday. The union representing them confirmed that the casino is yet to respond to that proposal. Specific details regarding the proposal were not disclosed at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Talks with the Casino Employees on Strike Continue</p>
<p>While negotiations continue, the DCC did not disclose why MGM Grand’s casino employees rejected the initial proposal that was accepted by the workers at the two other Detroit casinos. Instead, the Council explained that there are additional dates scheduled for negotiations and outlined that each casino property voted separately for the proposed five-year gaming contracts.</p>
<p>“Union members at MGM Grand Casino voted to reject the proposed deal and will continue to strike. More bargaining dates will be scheduled. Membership at each casino property voted separately about whether to accept the deal,“ reads a statement released by the Detroit Casino Council</p>
<p>Matt Buckley, MGM Resorts Midwest Group’s president and COO revealed earlier this month that it is disappointing to see MGM Grand’s employees reject the proposal. “This is a very disappointing result, especially considering the historic nature of our offer and the fact that it would immediately and positively benefit our DCC-represented MGM Grand employees and their families,” he explained at the time.</p>
<p>Moreover, Buckley was left baffled by the decision of the employees at MGM Grand, considering that the workers of the two other Detroit casinos voted in favor of the proposal. Speaking about the DCC, he said that even they deemed the gaming contract proposal as “historic” and one that offers good benefits along with an increase in pay for the casino workers.</p>
