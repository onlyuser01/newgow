    <h1>Lake Charles La Casino Golden Moon Hotel Casino Casinos In Tulsa Sweep Coin Casino Lucky Land Casino</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have made several deposits with the casino which were okay. One deposit of £35 was made which I said It had declined. I had an email also saying that it had declined. It still showed coming out of my bank as pending. I asked support and they said as it was pending it wouldnt be claimed so wait for it to go back into my account.</p>
<p>It was claimed and Natwest provided me with the authorisation code. I went back to the casino who continued to deny having the deposit. I had asked for my account to be closed as I did not want to play with a casino which appeared to be untrustworthy. I showed proof that the £35 had come out of my account and provided the authorisation code. I asked for the £35 to be refunded as I did. It want to play there.</p>
<p>i was repeatedly told They had no record of the deposit going into their account and it had been declined. I have proof that it was taken and the banks say they cannot assist as it had been fully authorised. The casino initially said they would refund the money but claimed they only way they could do This was to reverse a payment that they could see and this was for £30. This was allegedly done on 3rd March but never arrived.</p>
<p>i chased this again and again to finally be told that the refund had failed for some reason and the only way they could refund me was to an ecopayz account. this was no good to me as I don’t use ecopayz and cannot withdraw less than €100 from it. They insisted that this was the only way so I reluctantly started an ecopayz account and provided the number.</p>
<p>the money still did not arrive. I emailed again and was told that the £35 had been refunded to my card. They have not provided any details of this, no card number or reference and say it is now up to my bank. There are no refunds pending to wither of the accounts I used. This is also contradictory to the claim that they cannot refund £35 to a card as they don’t have the deposit showing to reverse.</p>
<p>my subsequent emails are now being ignored.</p>
<p>the casino have stolen £35 from me and refuse to refund it</p>
