<p>The globally-recognized gambling operator consisting of nine brands, Kindred Group, announced that it continues to expand the reach of its proprietary platform. Earlier this week, the company expanded its tech platform to another important market in North America by launching in Pennsylvania. The latest rollout complements the growth and expansion of Kindred's proprietary tech platform in the United States. In fact, the launch in Pennsylvania follows the successful introduction of the platform in New Jersey dating back to May this year.</p>
<p>A statement released on Tuesday by Kindred reveals that customers in Pennsylvania now have the option to tap into Unibet Casino and Sportsbook apps via the tech platform. According to the leading online gambling company, access to Unibet Casino and Sportsbook via the platform was initiated on July 10, 2023.</p>
<p>Nils Andén, Kindred Group's Interim CEO, shared his excitement about the latest announcement. "We are delighted to be able to migrate our customers in Pennsylvania onto the Kindred platform," he said. Last but not least, Andén explained: "Since launching in New Jersey, our customers have reported enhanced design, navigation and stability. We look forward to rolling out the Kindred platform to further States."</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent launch, customers in Pennsylvania will benefit from enhanced experiences, as well as personalized products and content. Moreover, expanding the reach of its tech platform enables Kindred to bring improved analytics.</p>
<p>The launch also complements the growth of the gaming company within the market in the state. In fact, Kindred's brand, Unibet, has gone live in Pennsylvania more than three years ago and has been expanding its presence since.</p>
<p>The announcement about Kindred's tech platform expansion in Pennsylvania comes after the company confirmed a new senior-level appointment last month. At the time, Kindred revealed that it hired Patrick Kortman for the role of Interim CFO of the Group. In his new role, he succeeded Johan Wilsby. Kortman assumed his Interim CFO role effective from June 21, 2023, and is expected to help the company's C-suite by delivering extensive experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, multiple senior-level executives confirmed their departure from Kindred. Back in May the Group's CCO Anne-Jaap Snijders, as well as CMO Elen Barber, unveiled plans to resign at some point this autumn. Additionally, Kindred's chief executive, Henrik Tjärnström, also confirmed his departure, which resulted in the appointment of Nils Andén to the role of Interim CEO.</p>
