    <h1>Texoma Casino Vee Quiva Casino Casino Laughlin Terribles Casino Best Casino Bonus Sportingtech Appoi</h1>

<p>Sportingtech has expanded its C-level team with the addition of Tommy Molly as chief sportsbook officer. Molloy will step into the new position at the multi-award-winning company and help guide it through the next growth periods Sportingtech has laid out and planned. Molloy comes bearing three years as sportsbook &amp; trading director at Pronet Gaming which will help him get settled in the new job.</p>
<p>Sportingtech Prepares for the 2022 World Cup</p>
<p>He also served a stint with Tabcorp UK where he worked as head of sports trading. Molloy will be particularly focused on helping Sportingtech and its flagship platform, Quantum, continue to deliver on sports betting offering solutions and drive growth in this particular vertical.</p>
<p>His appointment comes at a very important time for the world of sports as the 2022 World Cup is expected to drive record-setting numbers. Sportingtech already features Popular Bets and Events widgets which should help the company to secure a solid windfall from the upcoming sports betting bonanza later this year.</p>
<p>The appointment of Molloy was naturally welcomed by company managing director Bobby Longhurst, who joined the company recently himself. “Sportingtech’s strategy for growth has product innovation at its heart, and Tommy represents another vital piece of that puzzle,” Longhurst explained.</p>
<p>He welcomed Molly’s experience and superior knowledge of the sports betting place which will prove extremely valuable to the company.</p>
<p>Sportingtech is looking to secure a firmer foothold in a number of jurisdictions, including Latin America. Commenting on his appointment, Molloy was equally excited to be a part of the company and what it has to offer. He explained:</p>
<p>With the proven quality of our widgets and Quantum platform, the Sportingtech product portfolio is second to none, and the upcoming World Cup will be the perfect stage for us to show that. The strength of this offering means we can consistently offer operators the means to excel, and I look forward to helping showcase that in the weeks and months to come. Tommy Molloy</p>
<p>Sportingtech provides a scalable omnichannel platform that is able to process more than 500 million bets monthly and features 3 million unique players. The platform offers more than 65 different sports, supports over 1,000 betting markets, and runs 400,000+ live events every year. Sportingtech similarly has a casino offer that runs more than 9,500 games across numerous categories, such as slots, table, and live games, bingo, and poker.</p>
