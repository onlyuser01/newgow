<p>Just two days in, PokerStars’ inaugural PACOOP has been a huge success by nearly doubling most of its guarantees so far.</p>
<p>PACOOP Crushing Guarantees So Far</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Championship of Online Poker (PACOOP) started this weekend, and is off to a fantastic start. The event is just two days in, and it has attracted a huge number of players who are pleased to finally be able to be playing poker online in PA.</p>
<p>Over the course of the PACOOP, there will be 50 events held, and $1 million will be guaranteed across all of them. No matter what your budget is, you’ll be able to find a tournament that suits your bankroll as buy-ins will range from $30 to $750.</p>
<p>The first event of the PACOOP was the Warm-Up, which features a $100 buy-in and offers a $20,000 guarantee. It has seen an impressive turnout so far, by doubling its guarantee and attracting nearly 550 players. The prize pool is now worth over $50,000 – which is not a bad way to start of an inaugural tournament.</p>
<p>Another event to completely smash its guarantee was Sunday’s $100 Deepstack. Originally, it offered a $15,000 guarantee – but with almost 400 entries, the prize pool has grown to an impressive $35,000.</p>
<p>All-in-all, the PACOOP has seen over 2300 players enter this historic event. Now, the prize pool for the entire tournament is $250,000 – but, there are still 14 days left in the PACOOP, so PokerStars can expect to massively surpass its $1 million guarantee for its entirety.</p>
<p>The main event will take place on December 15th with a $300 buy-in. The prize pool is guaranteed at $100,000 – but, judging by the way things are going, it will be a lot bigger than that.</p>
<p>Players will also have the chance to take part in a Main Event Freeroll, which will take place on December 15th. 25 main event seats will be given away, and the only criteria is that you have to have made a deposit within worth $50 by 1:59pm on that day.</p>
<p>Didn’t Make the Money? You Have a Second Chance</p>
<p>If you entered any PACOOP but have been knocked out before making the money, we know your disappointment – but, that feeling shouldn’t last too long. PokerStars is offering players the chance to take part in Second Chance freerolls every day.</p>
<p>If you’ve bubbled in any PACOOP event, you’ll be able to take part in a daily tournament that is totally free to enter. In each of these events, $1250 will be paid out to its players. They take place at 6pm everyday until December 16th.</p>
