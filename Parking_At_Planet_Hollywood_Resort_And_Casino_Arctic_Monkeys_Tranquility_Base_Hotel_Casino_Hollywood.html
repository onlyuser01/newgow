    <h1>Parking At Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Arctic Monkeys Tranquility Base Hotel Casino Hollywood</h1>

<p>Dear BSA,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about the issue and understand your frustration.</p>
<p>I carefully checked the Bonus Terms on the website, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„Lord Of The Spins Casino reserves the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate all winnings and Bonuses for irregular play. "Irregular play" may include, inter alia:</p>
<p>14.1 Placing single bets equal to or greater than 30% from the value of the Bonus, deposit or Comp Points value credited to the player account.</p>
<p>14.2 Using the double-up feature to increase bet values.</p>
<p>14.3 Placing bets equal, zero, low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all be considered irregular gaming for Bonus play-through requirement purposes."</p>
<p>We would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>If you are aware of placing higher bets than the allowed ones, sadly, there is not much we can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to forward your game and bonus histories along with any relevant communication to petronela.k@casino.guru if you feel that you’ve been accused mistakenly, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
