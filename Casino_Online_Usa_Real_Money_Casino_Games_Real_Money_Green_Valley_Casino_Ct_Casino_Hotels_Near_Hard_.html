<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru .</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>As for the account that remains open - it should be still open and available for further play, and I strongly recommend you contact the casino customer support and ask them about this account.</p>
<p>The casino acted correctly and in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>However, even if there had been no third account (registered as the first one, where the casino's welcome bonus offer was used), the bonus offer was at least abused by the disputed account registered with your Gmail account, because you used the same bonus for the second time on this account. Although the casino allowed you to use the account that remains open, the casino did not refer you to the one registered with Gmail email. In addition, no one informed you that you are allowed to use bonuses on the account that remains open. Basically, they referred you to the casino's rules, where it is clearly stated that only 1 bonus is allowed per player, which is a common and industry-standard rule, valid in all online casinos. Not knowing about it does not mean it was not breached.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information and data, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - there is enough evidence to confirm we are talking about multiple accounts used by 1 person and bonus abuse. I asked you about some details and proofs (which were not provided), because the circumstances were not completely clear, especially the sequence of the events. I would like to explain everything as it is clear from the provided data.</p>
<p>Dear yennygarviso177,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information and data, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions - there is enough evidence to confirm we are talking about multiple accounts used by 1 person and bonus abuse. I asked you about some details and proofs (which were not provided), because the circumstances were not completely clear, especially the sequence of the events. I would like to explain everything as it is clear from the provided data.</p>
<p>At the time your "Hotmail" account was closed, there were already 2 other linked accounts registered in the casino, but the "Gmail" one was not active, or there was simply no reason to perform additional checks on it - the welcome bonus was used only after the "Hotmail" account was closed</p>
<p>Your "Hotmail" account was closed, but you were allowed to continue playing with the account that remains open (without permission to use the same welcome bonus)</p>
<p>Instead of the account that remains open, you started or continued using the "Gmail" account where you used the same welcome deposit bonus (a violation - bonus abuse anyway) allegedly for the second time</p>
<p>For some reason, the "Gmail" account was opened only 3 days before the "Hotmail" one, not active, and the welcome bonus was used later there, on June 30, 2023</p>
<p>The data and matches clearly show that there was another account, registered in the casino as the first one - approximately a month before your "Hotmail" and "Gmail" accounts, where the welcome bonus was used on the same day the registration was made</p>
<p>So, it was the third time you used the casino's welcome bonus offer on your disputed account</p>
<p>There are too many matches and connections between the 3 linked casino accounts to claim that they were not used by 1 person; therefore, it would be very difficult or likely impossible to prove anything else</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, we will not disclose more details about the data matches.</p>
<p>However, even if there had been no third account (registered as the first one, where the casino's welcome bonus offer was used), the bonus offer was at least abused by the disputed account registered with your Gmail account, because you used the same bonus for the second time on this account. Although the casino allowed you to use the account that remains open, the casino did not refer you to the one registered with Gmail email. In addition, no one informed you that you are allowed to use bonuses on the account that remains open. Basically, they referred you to the casino's rules, where it is clearly stated that only 1 bonus is allowed per player, which is a common and industry-standard rule, valid in all online casinos.
