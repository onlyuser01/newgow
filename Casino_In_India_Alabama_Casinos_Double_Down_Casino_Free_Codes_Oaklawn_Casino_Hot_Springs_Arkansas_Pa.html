<p>James Packer’s Las Vegas gamble might end up costing him more than he anticipated after investor interest in his Alon project hit a new low.</p>
<p>Crown Resort’s Alon project is set to cost $1.9 billion and will bring a new casino and hotel complex to the Vegas strip, but things aren’t going as smoothly as Crown or its CEO, Packer, would like.</p>
<p>Although few details have been released, it’s known that the Alon project will be built on the site of the old New Frontier casino and will likely boast a two-tower hotel complex with a total of 1,100 rooms.</p>
<p>Mystery Project Fails to Inspire Interest</p>
<p>However, aside from these details and some simple drawings, the full extent of the project hasn’t been made available for public consumption.</p>
<p>What has been revealed though is that Crown Resorts has a 74 percent stake in the $1.9 billion venture. What’s also known is that Crown wants to reduce this investment by around 45 percent, but so far it’s struggling to attract the necessary support from private investors.</p>
<p>In a recent report by Credit Suisse, it was revealed that Crown hasn’t been able to raise the $425 million it wants to help reduce its risk and help make the project a reality.</p>
<p>This apathy from investors has caused Crown’s bond risk to rise by 42 points in the last three months and could cause the company’s credit rating to take a hit in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In fact, with its debt-to-cash-flow ratio in a precarious position, Crown may soon have to make some tough decisions regarding the future of the Alon project.</p>
<p>Although it’s far from a dire situation, the company can’t afford to continue operating with such a large debt risk. Between the Alon project and its one-third stake in Melco Crown Entertainment’s $3.2 billion Studio City resort, Crown’s risk rating is now the highest it’s been since 2009.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for Crown’s inability to attract potential investors for its Vegas project is the demographic it’s aiming to attract.</p>
<p>According to Packer, the aim was to bring Chinese VIPs over from places like Macau and give them a new place to gamble.</p>
<p>However, with a general downturn in the Asian gambling economy and the further assumption that such a market no longer exists, investors now appear reluctant to gamble on Crown’s venture.</p>
<p>Concerns Over Crown’s Risk</p>
<p>While credit analysts are becoming increasingly concerned about the viability of the project, former Wynn Resorts executive and a member of the team behind the project, Andrew Pascal, maintains that things are progressing as planned.</p>
<p>“We are currently in the cycle of raising our capital, and the project has been well received. While the macro-economic environment, particularly in Asia, is a bit turbulent, we remain confident in our capacity to complete our financing and execute our project,” said Pascal.</p>
