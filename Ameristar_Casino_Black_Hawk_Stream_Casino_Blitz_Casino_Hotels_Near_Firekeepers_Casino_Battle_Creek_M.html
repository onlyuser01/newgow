<p>Vave Casino, the affiliate programâ€™s dedicated casino, also comes with more than 6,000 titles in its library, meaning that players can handpick from some of the best products they want to play in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Vave Partners will be able to access a number of affiliate companies that can help the casino further grow its reach and add new customers.
