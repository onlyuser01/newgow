<p>Rex the Hunt review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Take a step back in time with Rex the Hunt, and prepare to meet a dinosaur or two.</p>
<p>Players will face a humid jungle and begin hunting a formidable predator: Tyrannosaurus. As players stalk their prey, they’ll discover an ancient world filled with prehistoric creatures.</p>
<p>Dinosaur fans will immediately appreciate the theme of this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The animation is high quality, and players will immediately feel drawn into the lush greenery that surrounds the reels. This jungle is filled with strange, exotic flowers and eerie green light. The air shimmers slightly, adding a fantastical nature to this world.</p>
<p>The titular t-rex is animated in bright shades of orange and red, his teeth bared and vicious. Players will be left with no doubt that this creature is capable of defending himself.</p>
<p>Other dinosaurs appear among the symbols, including a blue pterodactyl and a golden parasaurolophus. Each one moves slightly on the reels, making these animals especially lifelike.</p>
<p>A human man is also part of the cast, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a stern expression. He seems to be in charge of the hunt, with his machete in hand.</p>
<p>Rex the Hunt has a tension-inducing soundtrack, blended with ambient bird calls. The strum of electric guitars gives the music an edgy rock-feel.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>With a 3x4x4x4x4x3 reel set, Rex the Hunt uses an Any Way Wins system. This means that wins are awarded when players land matching symbols in adjacent reels. Winning combinations pay out from left to right.</p>
<p>The swift gameplay ensures players will not have any trouble staying engaged.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>On reels 2-5, Stacked Mystery symbols may land. At the end of every spin, Stacked Mystery symbols can change into matching symbols.</p>
<p>If players land a Scatter on reel 1 and reel 6, the Free Spins feature begins, starting with 10 free spins. Throughout the feature, Mystery symbols remain sticky on the reels, and any Mystery symbols from the base game are transitioned into the bonus feature.</p>
<p>Players can retrigger the Free Spins feature with 5 additional free spins if Scatters appear on reel 1 and reel 6 again.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Scatter symbol, Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Rex the Hunt is 96.16%, around our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Rex the Hunt is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We propose a strategy of selecting the highest volatility when choosing slots.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this average RTP, medium volatility prehistoric wildlife-themed slot.</p>
<p>Although the middling volatility may not be the ideal for mathematically-minded players, the vivid animation, entertaining characters, and solid RTP are well-worth checking out.</p>
<p>The bonus features enhance the experience and add further appeal to Rex the Hunt.</p>
