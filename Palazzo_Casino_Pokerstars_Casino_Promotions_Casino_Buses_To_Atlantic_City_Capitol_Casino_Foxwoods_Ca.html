    <h1>Palazzo Casino Pokerstars Casino Promotions Casino Buses To Atlantic City Capitol Casino Foxwoods Ca</h1>

<p>Global sports betting and gaming brand and operator Kindred Group has secured a new partnership with EveryMatrix, and its OddsMatrix Sports Data Services, to boost the arrival of the operator’s new proprietary sportsbook with robust sports data.</p>
<p>As a result, Kindred Group will have access to various data provided by OddsMatrix across a number of sports, such as basketball, football, soccer, hockey, tennis, and much more. Kindred will tap into the robust OddsMatrix data stream to guarantee that the arrival of its bespoke sportsbook comes with access to some of the most reliable data.</p>
<p>Through this deal, Kindred Group will provide its customers with the best possible experience and leverage its own proprietary technology along with OddsMatrix’s exceptional solutions that bring in reliable, quick, and actionable data. Kindred Group Head of Trading Ben Colley has hailed the opportunity and said that in order to build the best and most accurate markets, the company needed the provision of data at the highest possible resolution:</p>
<p>"We’ve been really happy with what we’ve seen from OddsMatrix and our team of Quant Analysts and Data Scientists are now fully armed to take our internal R&amp;D work in the modelling space to the next level."</p>
<p>OddsMatrix is already an established provider of data, and an innovator in the sports betting field, bringing reliable custom datasheets, and helping operators create better and more entertaining markets based on projections for both in-play and pre-game markets. Erik Nyman, President of EveryMatrix Americas, was similarly pleased with this new opportunity.</p>
<p>"We are excited to follow their rollout and continue support their growth initiatives," Nyman concluded.</p>
<p>Nyman spoke about Kindred Group’s impressive track record in expanding its reach across the world and confirmed that EveryMatrix and OddsMatrix were honored to be part of the group’s new journey as it prepares to introduce the new sportsbook and build an even more streamlined experience for sports fans.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Sports Data Services itself delivers betting odds, scores, and real-time settlement, and it covers both traditional sports, as well as electronic sports. The solution has a powerful data feed aggregation that allows it to optimize the experience and it already covers more than 700 betting types across 100 sports and 1.5m events, based on the most recent data from 2022.</p>
