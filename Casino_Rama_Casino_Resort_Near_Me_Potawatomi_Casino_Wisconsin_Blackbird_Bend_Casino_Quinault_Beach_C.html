<p>SofaScore, a sports data company operating out of Croatia, teamed with Croatia soccer national and Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modrić to appoint him as its brand ambassador.</p>
<p>Boost Firm Profile and Exposure</p>
<p>The agreement between prominent Croatia national Modrić and provider of live scores SofaScore was reached on Sunday, when SofaScore founders Zlatko Hrkać and Ivan Bešlić met with Modrić. The focus of the deal will be the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar and SofaScore is seeking to boost its popularity among fans of soccer worldwide.</p>
<p>To commemorate the partnership with Modrić, SofaScore issued a statement, stressing the timing of the agreement just before the Qatar World Cup, a competition which could turn out to be the last one for the Croatia national on an international level.</p>
<p>“Luka joins SofaScore at a significant moment – before the Qatar World Cup, which could be his final major competition. We are eager to see the outcomes of this cooperation as well as the results of the Croatian national team. And, of course, to follow them on SofaScore.” SofaScore</p>
<p>Modrić, a four-time Champions League and Ballon d’Or winner, was a member of the Croatian soccer national team which played at the historic for the country 2018 World Cup and finished second, and SofaScore is looking to boost its exposure by leveraging its shared nationality with the prominent player.</p>
<p>Ahead of the major international competition this year, where Croatia will be looking to repeat its success, SofaScore intends to promote Modrić as a “unique product that connects fans, sport enthusiasts, and athletes” under their partnership.</p>
<p>With a monthly user base of 22 million and high ratings among live score category apps across both Google Play and App Store, SofaScore is firmly establishing itself as the go-to source of sports data for sport fans.</p>
<p>Turning Raw Data into Insights</p>
<p>According to SofaScore Head of Sales Daniel Jurilj, the firm is leveraging its capability to extract valuable insights from raw data and help its users to grasp a more complete picture of what is going on in the game.</p>
<p>Jurilj also outlined the importance for any company involved in sports, such as providers of live scores, betting operators, and others, to be able to provide a “seamless mobile experience,” if they want to be successful in this highly competitive space, stressing on the upcoming World Cup in Qatar.</p>
<p>Besides live scores, SofaScore provides data solutions available to leagues, teams and operators to help improve the sports betting industry and is in the process of developing new solutions that will further drive customer engagement for operators while the company seeks to position itself among the industry frontrunners.</p>
<p>For Modrić, the agreement comes while he and his Real Madrid teammates are preparing to host Manchester City in the second leg of this year’s Champions League semi-finals, looking to overcome a one-goal deficit from the first leg where the final score was 4-3.</p>
