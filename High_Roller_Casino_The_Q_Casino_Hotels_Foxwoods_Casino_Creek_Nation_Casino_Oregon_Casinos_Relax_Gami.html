<p>The iGaming aggregator and leading supplier of unique games for the online gambling industry, Relax Gaming, announced the release of its latest cluster pays slot game. On Tuesday this week, the company revealed it introduced Templar Tumble Dream Drop, a new knights-themed slot game that offers features such as free spins, mystery reveals and the iconic Dream Drop Jackpot.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming's new title incorporates symbols resembling different gems, along with special high-paying symbols that can form winning cluster combinations. The new video slot game displays the reel at the center of the screen and a knight holding a sword and a shield guards it from the left. On the right side of the reel, a creature that resembles a griffin is positioned.</p>
<p>The latest video slot game from Relax Gaming offers 117,649 payways. The high-volatility 6x7 reel slot game awards wins when matching symbols land from left to right starting with the first reel on the left. Similarly to other titles from Relax Gaming, Templar Tumble Dream Drop offers quality sound effects and a soundtrack that perfectly matches its Templar theme.</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming's CPO, was excited about the recently released slot game. "We have an unwavering commitment to developing games that players truly enjoy, and we know for a fact that our Tumble games have been hugely popular amongst our player base for a very long time," she explained in a statement.</p>
<p>Finally, Hannah said: "What better way to honor the original Templar Tumble game than with a highly anticipated Dream Drop release that can see players win incredible rewards thanks to our market-leading jackpot prizes."</p>
<p>Players of the new slot game from Relax Gaming can form wins when matching symbols land from left to right. In case they land a wild symbol, nearby symbols are transformed into blockers that remain on the grid until there are no more wins. Once this happens, those symbols turn into the same normal symbol or a coin that grants a chance for a prize with a multiplier of the player's bet between 1x and 1,000x.</p>
<p>Players who destroy all blocker symbols during the base game can access six free spins. During this special bonus round, there are no blocker symbols. "If a wild lands, normal symbols are turned into mystery symbols which either turn into matching symbols, an additional free spin, or coin symbols which are worth their weight in gold," explains Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>To enter the slot game's Jackpot Spin, players need to land six or more Dream Drop symbols. The spin is granted as an additional spin before a standard spin and customers have a chance to win one out of five jackpots. Such include RAPID, MIDI, MAXI, MAJOR and MEGA jackpots.</p>
