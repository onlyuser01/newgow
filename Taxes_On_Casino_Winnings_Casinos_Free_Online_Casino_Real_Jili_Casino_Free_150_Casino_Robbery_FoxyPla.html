    <h1>Taxes On Casino Winnings Casinos Free Online Casino Real Jili Casino Free 150 Casino Robbery FoxyPla</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>the day 2nd of December I opened the link of the casino and I registered.</p>
<p>i immediately contacted the agents in the chat to ask if it was legal and possible for me that I’m Italian resident to play from Poland as in this moment I’m in Poland as I come here often as the company I work for is based here. They told me it was all fine and I could play and withdrawal because Poland it was valid. Hence I uploaded my proof of residence and ID to validate the account. It was approved and I deposited in total 1.000€. I arrived to 10.000€ but suddenly I was not able to play anymore on first perosn roulette evolution because they blocked me to play. I asked the reasons and they unblocked and I arrived to 16345€ and I decided to stop and withdrawal. At the beginning they started to say in chat that the day week month limits were 1.000/2.500/10.000 but after I told them about terms and conditions they admitted 2.000/5.000/15.000. I started to ask the first 2 withdrawal for 4.000 in total and today I contacted them to have news and they changed totally approach to me starting to ask for a tons of documents: all card used for deposit and failed deposit, all bank statements of last 6 months, flight ticket to proof I will go to Italy and when I told them that I came here in the past by car with a friend they wanted I proof I was in a car. Then I uploaded everything again and then they started to say that it was not enough because suddenly they wanted also passport, bank statement and other documents translated and legalised. I told them that I work in KYC na di know how it works and that I had in the past similar problem fixed thanks casino guru. Moreover bank statement and passport are already official and valid. Now they are saying me they won’t send me money. This is very sad because when someone lose is ok but once someone is lucky they do like this. I will upload all the screenshot of my balance, transactions requested and chat</p>
