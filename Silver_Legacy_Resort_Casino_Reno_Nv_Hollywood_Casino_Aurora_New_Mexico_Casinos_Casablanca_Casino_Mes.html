    <h1>Silver Legacy Resort Casino Reno Nv Hollywood Casino Aurora New Mexico Casinos Casablanca Casino Mes</h1>

<p>this casino does not care what ever games they hire .i had a problem today while playing at this casino .yet i get a replay that the casino cant do anything about it because it is the provider and they also tell me that fair gaming they take it very serious.</p>
<p>i deposited 1800€ today was playing the grand casino from evolution .it is a land based table but very shady.the screen shows nothing only the hand of the dealer .at some moment i got only losing spins 99% only losing every 6,7 or 10 spins i get a win .i was betting u p to 150€ a bet .at one moment i made my bet and out of nothing the wheel was spinning with out the dealer touching the ball.the ball dropped very quickly in few seconds in number 2 in seconds other video came up with ball trying to drop into nuber 21 and it did and then in seconds again a new video showing the bsll trying to drop in number 25 and it did and i saw a different dealer .after winning number was anounced the video changed to the previous dealer who was spinning before .i never seen this before .i think i am scammed today for 1800€ with prerecorde numbers .after 10 more spins number 2 came up and after 11 numbers number 21 came up .so how is it possible the videos showing numbers that will hit .how?this is a huge fraud and deception .only thing casino asking is a video ???i am here to tspe or to gamble .this casino dont show any interest at all to solve the probem.they are taking advantage of the fact that a plsyer cant do anything about this .but in their terms state if the player take advantage of an error in the game they will confiscate all winning but thrmselfs take advantage of this scam .if you win they ask for 30 documents but if you get scsmmed they tell you it is probvder responsibilty.</p>
<p>i want all my deposits refunded because i am 100% they or evolution or along together they are scamming and covering each others.they say they are a lisensed casino but for what you have a license if you do not care about fairness???3 numbers showing in one spin is disgusting and asking for a video as proof is more disgusting .and taking players from restricted countries you know what kind of people they are .cowards .i will try to let my banc charge back the money this is just theft.i am advising all players to stay away from this casino because fair gaming is not guaranteed .they admit it themselfs.it is the provider what ghey tell hou .</p>
