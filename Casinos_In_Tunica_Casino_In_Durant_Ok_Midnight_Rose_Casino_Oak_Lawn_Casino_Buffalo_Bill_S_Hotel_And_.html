    <h1>Casinos In Tunica Casino In Durant Ok Midnight Rose Casino Oak Lawn Casino Buffalo Bill S Hotel And</h1>

<p>14/7/2020</p>
<p>TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN,</p>
<p>MY RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH SLOTS GARDEN AS A VIP LEVEL 3 MEMBER LEFT ME NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO WRITE AND ESCALATE THIS.</p>
<p>I HAVE BEEN PLAYING ON SLOTS GARDEN ONLINE CASINO FOR ABOUT OVER 2 YEARS NOW, AND EVERY TIME I HAVE WINNINGS AND REQUESTED A WITHDRAWAL, THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES WITH MY PAYOUT. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL DETAILS AND BANKWIRE DETAILS NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BEFORE A PAYOUT IS APPROVED, BUT ALSO I NEED TO MENTION THAT THE CASINO'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS STATES IT TAKES 7-10 DAYS FOR WITHDRAWAL TO BE APPROVED, AFTER THAT YOUR MONEY WILL BE PAID WITHIN THE NEXT 7 DAYS. NOW I HAVE RECEIVED MY MONEY EVERY TIME, BUT NOT IN THIS TIME FRAME.</p>
<p>TODAY IS NOW THE 14TH OF JULY 2020, AFTER I HAD WINNINGS AND REQUESTED A WITHDRAWAL ON 30 JUNE 2020 ALREADY, AND STILL WAITING FOR RESPONSE AND MY WINNINGS TO BE PAID OUT. EVERY TIME I FOLLOW UP ON LIVE CHAT, THE AGENT ADVISES THEY WILL ESCALATE THIS AS URGENT AND I NEED TO CHECK BACK AGAIN. I HAVE, OUT OF MY OWN ON 6 JULY 2020, ENQUIRED ABOUT MY WITHDRAWAL AND ASKED WHAT I CAN DO TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS OR PREVENT ANY DELAYS WITH MY PAYOUT. A VERY HELPFUL AGENT ASSISTED ME TO WHAT IS NEEDED AND I HAVE SENT ALL REQUIRED DETAILS AND DOCUMENTS AS PROOF ON THE SAME DAY WHICH WERE 6 JULY 2020. NOW AFTER THAT EVERY TIME I FOLLOW UP, I'M NOT SURE IF STAFF JUST WANTS TO PLAY FOR TIME OR KNOCK YOU OFF BECAUSE EACH AND EVERY TIME I NEED TO EXPLAIN AND ADVISE I HAVE SENT EVERYTHING VIA EMAIL ALREADY. OR THEY REQUEST IT ALL OVER AGAIN. NOW INSTEAD OF ONLY SENDING THIS TO "DOCUMENTS" DEPARTMENT WHICH IS "documents@slotsgarden.co.ca", I HAVE SENT IT TO "info@casinosupportcenter.com" AS WELL, TO PREVENT ANY DELAYS THAT MIGHT POP UP. NOW ON 9 JULY 2020 I FOLLOWED UP AGAIN AS I WERE INFORMED I NEED TO CHECK BACK IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS. THE AGENT I SPOKE TO ADVISED THAT IT WERE WRONG I ONLY NEED TO SEND IT TO "documents@slotsgarden.co.ca". I MEAN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!? I HAVE FORWARDED TO ONLY THIS EMAIL ADDRESS FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE, AND SINCE THEN I HAVE FOLLOWED UP DAILY, AND WITH NO SUCCESS!! I HAVE RECORD AND SCREENSHOTS OF ALL MY CHATS WITH THE AGENTS, AND IT IS RIDICULOUS TO FIND THAT EVERY ONE HAS ANOTHER STORY... I ,KINDLY REQUESTED THEM TO HANDLE THIS AND REVIEW MY PAYOUT URGENTLY AS I AM PATIENT TO GIVE THEM TIME TO DO THIS WITHIN TIME FRAME. BUT SINCE TODAY NOTHING HAS HAPPEND, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN INFORMED SEVERAL TIMES IT HAS BEEN ESCALATED AS URGENT...</p>
<p>NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO NOT CARE TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO REVIEW AND PROCESS MY WITHDRAWAL.. I WISH THAT THEY COULD PROCESS PAYMENTS AS FAST AS A DEPOSIT FROM MY SIDE IS CREDITED TO MY ONLINE ACCOUNT - BECAUSE THAT IS HASSLE FREE WITHIN SECONDS!! I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS CASINO, AND THE LEAST I EXPECTED WERE TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND PAY ME WHAT I DESERVE, WHICH IS MY WINNINGS - WITHIN TIME FRAME!!!</p>
<p>I AM HONESTLY NOT HAPPY WITH THIS!! MY BIRTHDAY WERE ON 12 JULY 2020, AND I COULD NOT EVEN CELEBRATE IT WITH MY WINNINGS. :(</p>
<p>I AM NOT SURE IF THIS REVIEW WILL DRAW ANY ATTENTION, AND I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE TO DO THIS AS I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SATISFACTORY SERVICE. AND I FEEL EVERY ACCOUNT HOLDER DESERVES THIS!</p>
<p>I DO NOT WANT ANY BRIDGES TO BE BURNED AS I DO ENJOY PLAYING ON SLOTS GARDEN, BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE THIS UNRESOLVED, OR RESOLVED AT THE CASINO'S OWN TIME.</p>
<p>WHY HAVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IF YOU CAN NOT ADHERE TO THIS, YOUR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS?????</p>
<p>I DO HAVE PROOF OF COMMUNICATION AND RECORD ON SCREENSHOTS OF ALL THE LIVE CHAT FOLLOW UPS WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT AGENTS.</p>
<p>I AM VERY UNHAPPY AND DISSAPOINTED. I EXPECT THIS MATTER TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN 48 HOURS AND MY WITHDRAWAL TO BE PROCESSED WITHIN 48 HOURS.</p>
<p>REGARDS.</p>
