    <h1>Hollywood Casino Buffet Twin Pine Casino Rosie Casino Okc Casinos Gambling Casino Dragon Gaming Debu</h1>

<p>Dragon Gaming has announced three new releases of popular video slots that will now debut as scratchcards games. The company, which focuses on developing cutting-edge iGaming software and games for the interactive casino sector, is bringing Rise of the Titans, Play with Cleo, and Saiyan Warriors to this new medium which will enable players to experience their favorite franchises in new wrappings.</p>
<p>Known Slots, New Experiences</p>
<p>The games have a 3×3 layout and a 95% return-to-player rate and come with a dedicated multiplier of 650x to elevate the gameplay. There are additional multipliers featured as part of the experience during the bonus round which adds to the entertainment value of each game.</p>
<p>In terms of graphics, all three titles have been developed in-house and have adopted original twists to fit Dragon Gaming’s unique artwork into this new form of gaming. To win, players would need to match three symbols, but there are some twists that will elevate the experience further. For example, players may depend on scatters to unlock free games with 10 free plays.</p>
<p>The Wheel of Fortune function will create larger winning opportunities where you can obtain a multiplier ranging from 3x to 10x. All of these details contribute to the overall satisfaction players would derive from playing either of the three titles. Yet, these gameplay optimizations pale in comparison when you think there is an actual 500x multiplier that can send your winnings through the roof.</p>
<p>Even More Opportunities to Win</p>
<p>And yet, the best of the games is still to be claimed as there is a 650x total payout on a single bet, which players will come to appreciate. The games are designed to fit any desktop and mobile experience across a range of platforms. They offer medium to high volatility and create truly unique experiences for slot and scratchers fans.</p>
<p>The games will be available starting March 31 throughout Dragon Gaming’s partner network and clients.</p>
