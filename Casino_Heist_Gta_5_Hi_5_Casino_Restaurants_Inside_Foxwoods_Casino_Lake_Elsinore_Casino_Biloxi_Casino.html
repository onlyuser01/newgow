<p>Sports betting technology supplier Kambi Group released details with regards to the topics of discussion during its upcoming digital event Festival of Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Global Sports Betting Landscape</p>
<p>Planned to take place from March, 15 to March, 19, the Festival of Sportsbook event will focus on the global sports betting landscape and will deliver content for a broad industry audience alongside exclusive insights on key industry topics.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to announce the public sessions for what is sure to be a fascinating week of discussions during Kambi’s Festival of Sportsbook, for which I’m looking forward to giving the keynote address.” Cecilia Wachtmeister, Executive VP, Business and Group Functions, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Cecilia Wachtmeister, executive vice president Business and Group Functions at Kambi, will open the event with a discussion centered on current market trends, and will then briefly introduce the topics for the week-long event.</p>
<p>US Sports Betting Will Take Central Stage</p>
<p>As expected, central place of the public content will be the gaining speed US sports betting industry, and Kambi will provide a comprehensive analysis of current developments on the market to set the scene for exploration for future growth opportunities.</p>
<p>“With many states in the process of regulating and others still to come, US sports betting is just getting started.” Cecilia Wachtmeister, Executive VP, Business and Group Functions, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Kambi will also deliver a presentation of its annual NFL Season Report, to outline behavioral data defining trends in America’s most popular sport.</p>
<p>Among other topics for discussion, Kambi will explore technology requirements behind high-performance sportsbooks and how its partner network data is being leveraged to benefit all partners.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, technology will of course play a crucial role in how the US market and others around the world evolve, so it was only right we gave these topics such prominence in the agenda.” Cecilia Wachtmeister, Executive VP, Business and Group Functions, Kambi Group</p>
<p>The importance of the US sports betting market for the technology operator was at full display recently, when Kambi announced its 2020 revenues were up by 28% driven by US expansion. Kambi posted a record 2020 revenue of €117.7 million, up from the €92.3 million it generated in 2019.</p>
<p>Consequently, the increased revenue led to a nearly 120% higher operating profit year-over-year, and profit after tax 130% higher than the year prior, as the operator underscored the busy sporting calendar and the exceptional operator margin among other key factors, besides growth in new markets.</p>
