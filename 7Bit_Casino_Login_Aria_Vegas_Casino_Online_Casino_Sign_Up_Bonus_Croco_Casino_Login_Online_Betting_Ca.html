<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I am absolutely disgusted and extremely sadden by the way I was treated by fab spins casino, which now goes under pokie surf as you are redirected to that casino.</p>
<p>I had one two large amounts but I deposited without any deposit bonus which had no restrictions attached to that deposit</p>
<p>first amount $38,753</p>
<p>Second amount $16,033</p>
<p>I have proof of both of these being one I have screenshots of these sitting in my account I have screenshots of pending wire transfers and I have video recordings on the day winning this large amount while playing on a slot</p>
<p>I was credited one payment of $2500 as they only allow you to withdraw in $2500 lot</p>
<p>once I received one payment I had the rest of my pending withdrawals sit there for over a month with the workers refusing to give me a straight answer telling me that they are going to be paid in the next cycle of payouts/wire transfers</p>
<p>I never received any more funds from them after becoming extremely frustrated with them and informing them for over two months but the money that I won I believe was a sign from god because my mother was dying from cancer and needed treatment at that time and I told them that this could not have come at a more important time and how important this money was to go towards helping assist keep my mother alive, They tried to make out like they cared about my personal circumstances and assured me a fast and speedy transaction process for the pending withdrawls to come, after becoming extremely frustrated with them after a month and a half they proceeded to block my usage of live chat so I could not talk to them then they logged me out of my account</p>
<p>Originally I joined spin Oasis I was then redirected one day randomly to gaga slots I was then randomly redirected a week later to fab spins, all the while raising this concern every time I was redirected to a new looking named Casino.</p>
<p>I was told that casino did no longer exist and I was redirected there and thatâ€™s where my account would be from now on I had no choice in the matter, What was extremely alarming every casino I was redirected to from logging into spin oasis still had the same workers with the same names that knew me and had the same conversation with me yet this was a " different casino" ðŸ˜‚ yeah right I didnâ€™t come down in the last shower, I unfortunately was new to online casinos and I had no idea about casino Guru that would be able to help and assist me</p>
<p>to know that these people intentionally and illegally and fraudulently denied my legitimate winnings through illegal and in breach of their rules they knew how important this was for my mother who was dying and weâ€™re this money would be going to, I also informed them that only a year earlier sadly my grandmother passed away on my birthday to the same cancer my mum was losing her life to.</p>
<p>these people did not give any respect or courtesy or any common human decency to pay me my legitimate winnings when I was there every day depositing hundreds of dollars even thousands of dollars a day</p>
