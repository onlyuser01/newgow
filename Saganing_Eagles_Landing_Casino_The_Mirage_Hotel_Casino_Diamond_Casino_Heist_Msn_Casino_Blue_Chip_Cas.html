    <h1>Saganing Eagles Landing Casino The Mirage Hotel Casino Diamond Casino Heist Msn Casino Blue Chip Cas</h1>

<p>MGM Resorts International announced Thursday its MGM Grand Detroit gaming property in Detroit, Michigan, will re-open August 7, albeit with certain limits to some of the venues. The public re-opening will be preceded by an invitation-only event.</p>
<p>The casino property will resume operations after months of closure, as in March Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered casinos, along with gyms, bars and theaters, to shut down operations to supports state and federal effort to curb the spread of the virus by preventing its person-to-person transmission.</p>
<p>“We are excited to reopen our doors and welcome back our guests and team members. These have been difficult and challenging times, but the Detroit community continues to weather these storms and will come back stronger.” David Tsai, President, Midwest Group, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>The gaming property will be capped at 15% capacity to comply with state rules for re-opening, and some of its amenities including the hotel and spa will re-open on a later date. Throughout the whole property, MGM’s Seven-Point Safety Plan will be enforced.</p>
<p>The casino at MGM Grand Detroit will implement strict safety protocols, built around physical distancing and enhanced cleaning and sanitizing. Smoking will not be permitted, with a designated outdoor smoking area created for smokers.</p>
<p>“I’m immensely proud of what our team has accomplished in these last four months to create a safer environment for our guests and employees, while still providing the premier gaming and entertainment experience MGM Grand Detroit is known for.” David Tsai, President, Midwest Group, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>Besides the cap on capacity required by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, physical distance for players will be established by re-configuring slot machines and reducing the number of seats at table games. The Poker Room will not open and Pai-Gow and Craps will not be available either. Sports betting will be accessible through the BetMGM kiosks located throughout the casino floor, or at the BetMGM Sportsbook window.</p>
<p>To ensure social distancing restaurants and bars at the property will have limited hours and reduced seating, the casino operator outlined in the announcement. Besides Tap at MGM Grand Detroit and National Coney Island, as well as Axis Lounge and Casino Video Poker Bar, all other bars and restaurants will remain closed until further notice.</p>
<p>The hotel at the casino resort will remain closed, albeit only temporarily as it is accepting reservations starting August 18. The spa and MGM &amp; Co retail shop will remain also temporarily closed.</p>
<p>Entry into the property may be available only through the self-park garage as valet service will not restart and valet parking will remain closed. Entry may be restricted for safety reasons when the property reached its cap on operating capacity.</p>
