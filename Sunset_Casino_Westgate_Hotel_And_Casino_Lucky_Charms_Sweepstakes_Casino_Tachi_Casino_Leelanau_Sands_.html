<p>Aspire Global aims to strengthen its worldwide presence as it just unveiled its rebranded iGaming PAM platform AspireCore.</p>
<p>AspireCore Signs a New Era</p>
<p>Aspire Global presented Monday its rebranded online gaming platform AspireCore. The Malta-based B2B service provider aims to expand its footprint in regulated iGaming markets around the globe.</p>
<p>AspireCore offers various services to gaming operators, such as player account management (PAM), and already operates in 25 markets in Europe, the US, South America, and Africa. It also features brand development and general operation tools.</p>
<p>Its “flexible and scalable PAM solution” facilitates entering regulated online gaming markets, Aspire said. According to the company’s CEO Taschi Maimon, this launch “heralds a new era for Aspire Global” as the supplier pushes its worldwide expansion.</p>
<p>The new platform is “robust and flexible”, as well as “highly stable” and currently handles more than three billion transactions every month and ran at 99.98% in 2020, Aspire added. It is able to provide operators with all the necessary resources, with the addition of high-quality and entertaining gaming content. Mr. Maimon dubbed AspireCore the “ultimate resource” for businesses.</p>
<p>Aspire Signs Multiple Deals to Enter New Markets</p>
<p>Aspire Global acquired gaming content provider Pariplay and BtoBet over the past two years. Those deals allow the company to bring localized sports coverage, live dealer, and casino gaming to its partners and its own studio via AspireCore.</p>
<p>Recently, the supplier signed major deals with William Hill, in the process of being acquired by Caesars Entertainment, and Betfair to enter the regulated Colombian market.</p>
<p>It also shared its plans to bring its operations into the new German and Dutch regulated markets in 2021, while boosting its footprint in the jurisdictions where Aspire is already licensed.</p>
<p>“2021 promises to be an important year for Aspire Global. With a comprehensive offering, we are in a strong position to capitalize on new opportunities and deliver growth for our new and existing operator customers.” Taschi Maimon, Chief Executive Officer at Aspire Global</p>
