<p>Sports gamification expert Low6 and the franchise of the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals announced a new partnership that will see the launch of two free-to-play games.</p>
<p>Fan Engagement</p>
<p>The deal between the UK-based gamification company and the NFL franchise from Ohio will release the Bengals Picks and Ultimate Bengals free-to-play-games to mark the second acquisition in the US for Low6. It follows fresh on the heels of last week’s partnership the gamification specialist established with the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>We are excited to partner with Low6 on the launch of our two new Free to Play games ‘Ultimate Bengals’ and ‘Bengals Picks.’ These games will provide an additional way for our fans to engage with the team on game day.” Brian Sells, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Cincinnati Bengals</p>
<p>The Bengals Picks free-to-play game is set to mirror games played in the UK across the popular MMA app and UFC Picks, and will allow supporters of the team to engage with the players on game day. The free-to-play game made its debut with this weekend’s game in which the Bengals welcomed the Green Bay Packers at their Paul Brown Stadium in the center of Cincinnati and lost 25-22.</p>
<p>Speaking about the announcement, Low6 co-founder and Group CEO Jamie Mitchell noted the company is still at the early stages of its journey in the US, looking forward to bringing the American audience “closer than ever to their favorite teams.”</p>
<p>Increased Client Database Valuations</p>
<p>Excited to launch its proprietary gaming platform with the Bengals, Low6 anticipates “avid fans sharing their exciting pack openings online, trading with friends and scoring fantasy points” to win incredible experiences for free, Jamie Mitchell continued.</p>
<p>Low6 is well positioned to capture this passionate fandom group through digital community-led mobile gamification that provides Bengals with new opportunities to drive engagement among their young fans and ultimately drive revenue back to the team.” Jamie Mitchell, Co-Founder and Group CEO, Low6</p>
<p>Pointing out the significant gaming experiences Low6 created for its partners like Uber Eats, UFC, European Tour, Glasgow Rangers FC and others, Mitchell concluded that Low6 products impact their partners’ client databases by increasing their valuations.</p>
<p>Participants in the Bengals Picks game make predictions about the outcome of a designated match and accumulate points accordingly, with the likelihood of winning a bigger share of the prize pool increasing with the amount of points a player accumulates. The prize pool each week features tickets to upcoming matches, as well as signed team merchandise.</p>
<p>The second free-to-play game, Ultimate Bengals, is also set to run during the course of the NFL season and will award the winner each week with match tickets, autographed merchandise and experiences money can’t buy.</p>
<p>Josh Turk, chief strategy officer at Low6, commented on the partnership announcement, stressing the activation of the ‘Who Dey’ fanbase by integrating both free-to-play games and their unique gaming experiences into the Bengals official mobile app as part of the company’s commitment to providing first-class free-to-play gaming platform for the fans of the NFL franchise.</p>
