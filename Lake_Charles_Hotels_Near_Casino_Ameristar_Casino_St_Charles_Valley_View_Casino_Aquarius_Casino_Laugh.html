<p>The operator has expanded its presence in the United Kingdom and Ireland with a new partnership with the popular horseracing racecourse</p>
<p>Moving forward, QuinnBet will sponsor three events that will be held at the racecourse and allow the winning horse to claim the prize pool. The three-race format will essentially mean that participating horses will have to score the highest tally of points across all three races.</p>
<p>QuinnBet is excited to have the opportunity to grow its footprint in horseracing in the Irish-regulated market and provide yet more opportunities for the sport to grow, and nurture competitive talent.</p>
<p>The operator will also be awarding special prizes to the grooms of the winning horse in every three races. Commenting on the new opportunity, QuinnBet director Stephen Kelly said:</p>
<p>We are delighted to enter into our first partnership agreement with The Curragh which will provide us with a major platform to raise the profile of our brand. QuinnBet director Stephen Kelly</p>
<p>Kelly argued that the company is proud to further expand its footprint in Ireland and ensure that its sponsorships are designed to support the industry as a whole. The first race will be held on July 23, followed by another meeting on August 12, and a third one on October 7, giving potential participants sufficient time to prepare.</p>
<p>The Curragh racing and sponsorship manager Evan Arkwright was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see the racecourse expand its significance on the racing calendar and said:</p>
<p>Their brand will be associated with a variety of very competitive races which will give them maximum exposure over three individual days. The Curragh racing and sponsorship manager Evan Arkwright</p>
<p>He further added that the team at The Curragh was working to actively explore all opportunities presented by this new round of collaboration. QuinnBet has been in the habit of sponsoring a variety of meetups over the years.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, QuinnBet said that it would be sponsoring the Grand National Trial race, which is held ahead of the actual event, rebranding the event as QuinnBet Grand National Trial. Such partnerships have been a good opportunity to establish the brandâ€™s presence in the market and make it an established household name.</p>
<p>Also this year, QuinnBet established a partnership with Global Media Ink, a prominent Oddschecker. The partnership will continue throughout 2023 and 2024.</p>
