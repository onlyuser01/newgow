<p>After two rounds of the 2022-23 Champions League, Chelsea is still without a win, the result of which is that the Blues are sitting at the bottom of Group E. AC Milan is on the opposite end of the group table, but that can change if they Italians don’t do well on their trip to London. Judging by the betting odds available online, bookies think they won’t do great at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Chelsea Coming Off the #1 Win in the Graham Potter Era</p>
<p>After sacking Thomas Tuchel due to poor performances at the start of the 2022-23 campaign (most notably, the 1-0 loss to Dinamo Zagreb in the UCL), Chelsea appointed Graham Potter as their boss.</p>
<p>The former Brighton manager started his campaign with a 1-1 draw with Salzburg at home, which his team did dominate. Still, Chelsea’s attackers just weren’t good enough to score more than once.</p>
<p>Graham Potter recorded his first victory as the Chelsea boss on Saturday in the Premier League. Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 with the winning goal being scored in the 90th minute by midfielder Conor Gallagher.</p>
<p>Injury Problems Worrying AC Milan Fans</p>
<p>There are at least nine players from AC Milan’s first team who will probably miss the Chelsea game. Among those are long-term absentees like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, for example, who hasn’t played a single game in the 2022-23 season due to a knee injury.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of new additions to the injury list as well. Goalkeeper Mike Maignan got injured during the international break and will probably have to stay off the pitch for a while. As a result, 37-year-old backup Ciprian Tatarusanu will have to go between the posts. Knowing that the Romanian goalie has played just one competitive game since 2021, AC Milan is in trouble.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, they will also miss a couple of crucial defenders, most notably, Theo Hernandez. On top of everything, Simon Kjaer is also reportedly struggling with an injury, but he will probably play against Chelsea even without being 100% fit.</p>
<p>Chelsea vs AC Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Knowing about AC Milan’s injury woes, Chelsea have an opportunity they mustn’t miss. Anything but a dominant win for the home side would be a major disappointment.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
