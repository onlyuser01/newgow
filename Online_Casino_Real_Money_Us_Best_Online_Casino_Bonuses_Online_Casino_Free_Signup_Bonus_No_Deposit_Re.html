<p>The company strengthened its senior level team with the hire of the former Conexus Group executive that brings more than 14 years of experience in iGaming</p>
<p>The leading global betting platform provider, Playbook Engineering, strengthened its C-suite with a new strategic hire. The company confirmed Wednesday that it selected the former Conexus Group executive with extensive online gambling industry experience, Luke Cousins, for the role of commercial director.</p>
<p>The recent appointment comes on the heels of another strategic hire announced by Playbook Engineering. Early last month, the company strengthened its senior management team with the hire of Ivo Doroteia for the role of chief executive officer (CEO). The strategic appointment of the new CEO coincided with the company’s plans for further growth and expansion.</p>
<p>Now, with Cousins aboard, Playbook Engineering anticipates further expansion to existing and emerging markets. Ultimately, the new commercial director is expected to strengthen the company’s executive team and deliver invaluable knowledge, advice and insights. At the same time, with the recent hire, Playbook Engineering helps strengthen the company’s position as a global provider for the growing iGaming casino and sports vertical.</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Cousins pointed out: “I was looking for a quality product to represent as I still see a lot of opportunity in the global market.” He explained that the strength of the company’s platform made his decision to join it even easier.</p>
<p>The Commercial Director Brings Extensive iGaming Experience</p>
<p>Moreover, Cousins said that Playbook Engineering demonstrates high retention rates and KPIs, backed by unique customer experiences. The new commercial director spoke about the emerging growth opportunities the company can seize within new and existing markets. Finally, Cousins said: “Playbook has proven that it has quality technology, along with the people we have in place, so we will be well positioned to take advantage in those markets.”</p>
<p>“I am excited about the regulations currently happening and the opportunities these provide in new markets, whether that be developing markets such as Africa or LatAm where there is mass market potential, but also looking at maturing regulated markets such as in the US or Ontario, which can be difficult markets to penetrate but ultimately very valuable.“ Luke Cousins, commercial director at Playbook Engineering</p>
<p>Overall, Cousins brings 14 years of experience within the online gambling sector. His professional background includes overseeing the launch of Pentasia’s first US office in New York. Moreover, he was also a part of Conexus Group in North America where he spearheaded the development of the business. Throughout his extensive career in iGaming, Cousins was also a part of Moja Group and Hypometer, where he held strategic roles.</p>
