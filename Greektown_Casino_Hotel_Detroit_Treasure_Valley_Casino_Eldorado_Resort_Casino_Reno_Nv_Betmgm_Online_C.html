    <h1>Greektown Casino Hotel Detroit Treasure Valley Casino Eldorado Resort Casino Reno Nv Betmgm Online C</h1>

<p>My complaint is regarding a bonus I received which I had completed the terms on, but then confiscated my winnings. I used to really like playing at yabby, but since this experience I don't play here anymore.</p>
<p>Ok, so this is a pretty long story, but I will try and give you enough detail to see my point, but keep it short enough that you don't fall asleep. So I played a no deposit bonus for free spins and just so happened to do really well. I cashed out, which incidentally, though this is not the issue I'm speaking of, this cash out was an arduous process as well. While I was waiting for my money to hit my account I received an email from Yabby's marketing department. You see, they have a Weekly Newsletter that they publish which I subscribe to, and in this newsletter they have a drawing. Basically they give you a story, you have to deduce information from the story which you used to answer a question. With that they draw a hundred or a couple hundred winners who got the answer right, and offer a reward of 200 spins. I happened to get that reward, and was informed of that through that email I spoke of. So, as soon as my payout was complete, I typed the promo code in and got my 200 spins. Wouldn't you know it, I was successful again! Max payout was $100. So as soon as the playthrough was finished, I decided I wanted to cash that out, and then since I was feeling lucky, deposit some money in afterwards. Much to my chagrin, I received an email saying that I broke the rules of the "offer", because it stated that the last action on my account had to be a deposit in order to use the free spins, which I should mention expired Within 3 days of my receiving them.</p>
<p>I was upset, mainly because when I complained to customer service, they seemed completely unempathetic. Almost felt like they were shaming me. My argument to them was this: if you're telling me that the last action on my account had to be a deposit, but you don't allow deposits on accounts if there is bonus winnings on there, which if you remember I had, then what you're telling me is, you expect me to deposit some money, purposefully lose all that money, in order for me to claim A PRIZE. Note that I said prize, and not bonus, because this was a drawing that their newsletter was running. I was not bonus hunting, or Advantage playing, Etc. I just happened to win their drawing. That does not seem like a fair set of rules. And to make matters worse, instead of explaining things, listening to anything I had to say Etc, the email said they had no other choice but to confiscate all my winnings, which is b<strong><em>*</em></strong>. All of my contacts with support members, supervisors and the like were all exactly the same. It was like talking to a wall made of robots. Same answer, same cookie cutter script. I simply don't see how I can be held at fault for being lucky enough to win in two trips in a row to their Casino, and with the way they had the rules set up, that seems to be exactly what they're saying.</p>
<p>I do have some screenshots of the conversations and emails between the casino and I. They might help to explain things a little better than I did; I know it's a rare and confusing situation. But to whomever reads this, I thank you in advance for your time. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, or need more information from me.</p>
