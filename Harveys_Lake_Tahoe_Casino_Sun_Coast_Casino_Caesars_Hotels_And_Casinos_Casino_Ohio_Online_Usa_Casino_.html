    <h1>Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino Sun Coast Casino Caesars Hotels And Casinos Casino Ohio Online Usa Casino</h1>

<p>Do you know what has changed in the Bigger Bass Bonanza play? The frequency of reaching free spins. I'm one of those people, when a new game comes out, I look at it and if I find it interesting, then I look at what's happening on the reels. Do I have a chance of getting a free spin everywhere or not? It used to be the case that they were included in all reels in the Bigger Bass Bonanza series - for some time now it has been the case that this is no longer the case. Good to see on reels 4 and 5. If you get the scatter 10 times on reels 2 and 3 in one spin, you still have the opportunity to get a scatter on reels 4 and 5. The only problem is that in 8 out of 10 cases no scatters are involved at all - that doesn't mean anything else, no scatters run through so that you have any chance of getting the scatter. It's the same with reels 1 and 4-reel 5, often without a scatter in the run.</p>
<p>This means that the player is now given two opportunities to enter the free game. That's why you have to be happy to get a free spin once in 100 spins - a maximum of 2. But in the past you got the free spins 3 to 4 times.</p>
<p>But for me it's more like trying to get players to buy the free spins. Which is a disgrace for me - because then the whole thing no longer has anything to do with happiness. And the streamers also contribute a large part to this - they always supposedly win so much 100k.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, since the streamers have been playing for crazy amounts of money, things have been going downhill for normal players.</p>
<p>In the past, when I bet 100 euros, for example, I always started with 1 euro - now I don't even dare to play with 50 cents when I see how often you get ripped off in the games. But as I said, I'm going to take a break now - I get annoyed too much, and this circumstance is a bad companion for a casino player</p>
