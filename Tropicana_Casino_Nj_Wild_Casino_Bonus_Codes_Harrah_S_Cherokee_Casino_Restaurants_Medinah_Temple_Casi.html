<p>Islam Makhachev is defending his UFC Lightweight title for the first time. He’s doing it against the No.1 UFC pound-for-pound fighter, Alexander Volkanovski, at UFC 284 in Perth, Australia</p>
<p>Islam Makhachev vs Alexander Volkanovski – whoever wins this fight will be the UFC Lightweight champion, as well as the highest-ranked fighter in the world. There’s so much at stake, which is why we expect to see a real spectacle.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers don’t think Volk will become a double-champ. Instead, they heavily favor Khabib’s protégé to defend his championship belt. Are they right to think so or will the Aussie fighter pull off an upset in front of his own crowd? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Reasons Why Islam Makhachev is a -400 Favorite</p>
<p>Islam Makhachev (23-1) is the reigning UFC Lightweight champion who won the championship belt after beating Charles Oliveira by submission last October. He did it in Round 2 with an arm-triangle choke, which is kind of surprising knowing that his Brazilian opponent is a BJJ expert.</p>
<p>By outwrestling Oliveira, Makhachev showed the world that he might be the very best wrestler/grappler in the world today. In fact, some believe that the only man who could beat him on the floor is his mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>

<p>Actually, there are stories about Makhachev causing serious problems to Khabib during practice in a manner that no one’s ever done to the lightweight GOAT.</p>
<p>But Makhachev isn’t just about making takedowns that his opponent can’t get away from. He’s also a fine striker with unbelievable stamina. Sure, he’s not as proficient a boxer as Volkanovski, but he is four inches taller than him, meaning that the Australian will find it difficult to outbox Makhachev.</p>
<p>Alexander Volkanovski Ready to Upset the Odds in His Homeland</p>
<p>Alexander Volkanovski is 25-1 in his career, but most of those fights happened in the 145-pound division. In fact, the last time he fought as a lightweight was in 2016. Since moving to the UFC, he’s only fought in the featherweight division winning 12 fights and losing none.</p>
<p>Volk got ahold of the championship belt some three years ago and has defended it four times – two times against Max Holloway, once against Brian Ortega, and once against Chan-sung Jung.</p>
<p>Now, he wants to add another title to his collection, but this is going to be the toughest challenge in his professional career. He’s smaller, weaker, and way inferior on the floor than Makhachev. Volk, however, does have some advantages.</p>
<p>For instance, he’s a much better boxer who knows how to fight smart. He also has a decent takedown defense, although it might not be good enough to stay on the feet against Makhachev.</p>
<p>Islam Makhachev vs Alexander Volkanovski Prediction</p>
<p>We think Volkanovski is the GOAT of the UFC Featherweight division. We also think Makhachev has the potential to become the GOAT of the UFC Lightweight division. Sure, he’s got a long road ahead of him, but to achieve his dreams, beating Volkanovski is a must.</p>
<p>Pick: Islam Makhachev to win by submission</p>
