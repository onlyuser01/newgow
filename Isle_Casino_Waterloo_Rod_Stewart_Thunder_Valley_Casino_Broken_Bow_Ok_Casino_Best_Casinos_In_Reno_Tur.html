<p>England vs Senegal is a matchup between two teams that are very strong at the back. So far, the Three Lions have kept a clean sheet on two occasions. The Lions of Teranga conceded in each 2022 World Cup game so far, but with players like Edouard Mendy (goalkeeper) and Kalidou Koulibaly (center-back), they shouldn’t worry about getting blown out.</p>
<p>What they should worry about is whether they can find the net against England. The thing is that Gareth Southgate’s boys will (almost certainly) be the ones to keep the ball in their possession for most of the game. Can Senegal hit them on the break?</p>

<p>England Players Looking Good in Qatar</p>
<p>So far, England have been pretty good. They finished the group stage of the tournament with two wins and a draw. Their score differential is 9-2, which shows how impressive these guys have been so far. They’ve been doing a great job as a collective, which is why it’s no surprise that they were the dominant force in every game thus far.</p>
<p>In Round 1, they had a 78% possession against Iran, creating 13 goal chances. Against the USMNT, they had the ball in their possession for 55% of the time, with eight goal attempts. In the final round of the group phase, they dominated the game against Wales with 65% possession and 17 goal chances.</p>
<p>We expect to see them on the front foot on Sunday as well, but finding the net against Senegal is not going to be easy.</p>
<p>Senegal Ready to Fight Back</p>
<p>The champions of Africa came to Qatar without their best player Sadio Mane. Without the forward on their roster, they were expected to score a modest number of goals. It sure looked like that after Round 1 in which they lost 2-0 to the Netherlands. However, in the second round, Senegal beat Qatar 3-1, followed by a 2-1 win over Ecuador.</p>
<p>What’s kind of surprising is that they conceded in each of those games. The reason why we find that interesting is that Senegal has some really good players at the back. Their goalkeeper is Edouard Mendy, who serves as Chelsea’s first-choice keeper last season. In front of him is another Chelsea player, Kalidou Koulibaly, who’s considered one of the best center-backs on the planet right now.</p>
<p>England vs Senegal Prediction</p>
<p>We expect to see a real battle in the center of the pitch. England will probably be on the front foot, but we reckon Senegal players will be able to keep them at a distance for most of the match. Still, we do have faith in England’s forwards who should be able to find the net at some point (probably late in the game).</p>
<p>Picks: England to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
