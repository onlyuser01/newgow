<p>Swedish-based gambling group Betsson AB announced this week it has managed to successfully place new senior unsecured bonds in the amount of €90 million ($94.23 million).</p>
<p>Institutional Investor Interest</p>
<p>The new bonds issued by Betsson AB are under a framework of up to €250 million ($261.75 million), have a tenor of three years, and bear a floating interest rate of 3 months Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus 650 bps and a final maturity date in June 2025.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Betsson’s chief financial officer Martin Öhman expressed his content that the company’s new bonds attracted “large interest… from a broad range of investors,” among which Nordic and international institutional investors.</p>
<p>“This signals confidence in our business strategy, which continues to generate profitable growth and stable cash flows.” Martin Öhman, CFO, Betsson AB</p>
<p>On June 8, 2022, in preparation for the new bond issue, Betsson offered holders of outstanding senior unsecured floating rate bonds in the amount of SEK1 billion (€93.34 million/$98.06 million) with a maturity date of September 26, 2022, to tender their bonds for purchase by the company at a price of 100.50% of their nominal amount.</p>
<p>Bond Settlement to Take Place on June 23</p>
<p>The gambling group announced the tender offer to bondholders expired on June 15, 2022, and bonds totaling SEK700 million (€65.34 million/$68.64 million) have been validly tendered and accepted for settlement by the issuer.</p>
<p>Betsson expects settlement with the bondholders to occur on June 23, 2022, and it will pay 100.5% of the bond’s nominal value and “accrued and unpaid interest from, but excluding, the previous interest payment date until, and including, the settlement date” of the tender.</p>
<p>For both the new bond issue and the previous tender Nordea bank acted as the dealer manager and sole book runner while Swedish law agency Gernandt &amp; Danielsson acted as Betsson’s legal counsel.</p>
<p>The news about the new bonds was released on Wednesday after the market close when Betsson’s share price was SEK62.95 ($6.17).

<p>In its first quarter 2022 report, Betsson registered an increase in group revenue by 8% driven mainly by sportsbook operations which accounted for 45% growth. Active customers increased by 33% but the positives ended with this as EBITDA fell by 7%, operating income fell by 13%, net income was down by 12%, and operating cash flow decreased by 17%.</p>
