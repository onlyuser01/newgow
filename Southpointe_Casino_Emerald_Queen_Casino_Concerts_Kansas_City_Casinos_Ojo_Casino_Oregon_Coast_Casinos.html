    <h1>Southpointe Casino Emerald Queen Casino Concerts Kansas City Casinos Ojo Casino Oregon Coast Casinos</h1>

<p>I don't know if you guys can help me with this but I'll take my chance.</p>
<p>So, I have an old account with them where I always deposit bitcoin and played from my personal laptop. With time, I think I lost over 5000 EUR or more but that's not the problem. In case of an withdrawal, they always approved it in 1-2 hours, never asked for anything else ( because the total amounts deposited in time were way higher than my withdrawals probably ) , and this is what I want to talk about now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was on a business trip and I created a new account on their website from my work laptop, deposited around 250 EUR without accepting any bonus. I played some slots and won. When I reached 2400 EUR, I decided to withdraw.</p>
<p>After 16 hours they declined my withdrawal and asked me to submit my ID and a proof of address document. No problem, did that also.</p>
<p>After that, they asked me to upload a selfie holding my passport and a QUOTE: "checkered/lined piece of paper saying Hello, casino name and current date / Please note, that the sheet shouldn't be monotone. Use a sheet with additional textures, e.g. checkered one. "</p>
<p>So I searched my house for a CHECKERED " PIECE " of paper, as they asked, and uploaded the selfie.</p>
<p>After that I asked them if everything is ok and they said I need to take another selfie with the same requirements but to use the entire sheet of paper, which is absurd because I don't have this kind of paper in my house, only blank paper.</p>
<p>They said they can't do anything else if I don't send them this picture again so I started an argue with them and asked them to return my initial deposit of 250 EUR and close my account. They closed my account and no money was returned.</p>
<p>Now, my point is as follows. Is it normal to ask this stupid verification and reject it all the time only to those who win ? Because on my other account where I am loosing over 5k EUR, nobody asked for anything and withdrawals were processed always in 1 hour . This is not fair and honestly I don't care too much about the money, as I care about the principle. Their terms say that verification might be required for the first withdrawal, but they should tell people that verification is required for the first withdrawal in case you win, because if you loose and give them your money, nobody cares who you are. This really seems like a scam and I hope somebody does something. I attached to this email all the documents that I sent to them and if you need more proof, I can show you screenshots of the transactions from my old account, where nobody asked for anything, because I am still loosing on that account.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
