    <h1>Yamaba Casino Paris Casino Restaurants Casino San Bernardino Santa Fe Hotel And Casino Betvisa Casin</h1>

<p>don’t play at the jeetcity casino, I registered with them, submitted all the documents for verification and they didn’t check for 3 months, I played, deposited and withdrew money until one day I won a large amount of almost 37,000 Canadian dollars! when I won, I started to withdraw money, but my withdrawal requests were rejected and asked to go through verification, I passed and they checked for a long time, and every time I wrote to them how long to wait, they didn’t give me any deadlines or information (they just told me to come back and enjoy the game) I returned and started playing, time passed and in 2 days I lost almost the entire amount, only 3600 dollars remained and they transferred me only 3000 and left 600 and still don’t give it back! I want to note that when I wrote to them about my displeasure that they were stalling for time and for this I lost, they blocked me with the pretext that I was an addict! How come ? they themselves offered to play! and it’s my right to play! My complaints were as follows (why didn’t they check my data right away?) Why did they allow me to withdraw money and top up my account before the big win? Why didn’t they let me know how long it would take for verification? and why did they block me? and this provoked me! I want justice, they don’t have the right to use people like that! They do everything very thoughtfully, I won this money honestly and wanted to withdraw, and if they had not rejected my transfer and advised me to continue playing, I would not have lost or lost! Is it possible to somehow regulate human rights? In any country, according to the constitution, human rights must be protected, I ask you to help resolve this matter, thank you for your remote time, regards Giorgi</p>
