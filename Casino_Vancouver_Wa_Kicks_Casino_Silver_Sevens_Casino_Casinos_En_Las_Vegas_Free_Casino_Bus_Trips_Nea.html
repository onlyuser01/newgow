    <h1>Casino Vancouver Wa Kicks Casino Silver Sevens Casino Casinos En Las Vegas Free Casino Bus Trips Nea</h1>

<p>Entain’s Italian subsidiary Eurobet announced a new partnership with the independent provider of virtual sports GlobalBet that will see the brand’s retail and online verticals strengthened by virtual football and other products licensed by the country’s gambling regulator ADM.</p>
<p>Bolster Product Offering with Virtual Sports</p>
<p>GlobalBet will supply Eurobet with its flagship Virtual Football PRO and other virtual sports products at multiple retail locations in Italy and online to boost Eurobet’s appeal to sports bettors.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about our partnership with GlobalBet. Our aim is to enhance our virtual sports offering with the advanced visuals on the market, this is the main reason we wanted GlobalBet’s lifelike products in our virtual portfolio.” Eurobet head of sportsbook and trading Federico Spescha</p>
<p>Developed in-house, the suite of GlobalBet’s virtual products utilize algorithms and animation tools, including motion capture and 3D graphics, and create an experience as close to the real-life feeling as possible, recreating events, stadia, and athletes, with added commentary on the action.</p>
<p>“Italian engagement with online virtual sports betting products continues to be on the rise due to COVID-19. We are proud to be a leader in Virtual Sports innovation, and we look forward to introducing our award-winning PRO Series games with its lifelike visuals and enhanced mathematical model to Italian players via Eurobet.” GlobalBet CEO Daniel Grabher</p>
<p>Headquartered in Malta and with offices in Liechtenstein, Barcelona, Vienna, and Kyiv, GlobalBet’s portfolio of virtual sports covers over 15 sports and number games and provides the most realistic, reliable, and comprehensive betting solutions to gaming industry operators.</p>
<p>Specialists in virtual sports since 2004, GlobalBet does not rely on pre-recorded footage of live events to provide the industry, both land-based and online, with true virtual sports products built on the highest visualization standards and with in-built capabilities for customization.</p>
<p>Retail on the Path of Recovery</p>
<p>The new partnership with GlobalBet is the latest effort of global gambling group Entain to boost the appeal of its retail and online business in Italy since last September when Entain announced Eurobet’s retail shops in Italy would be part of the digitization that would see retail shops in key locations being transformed into contemporary, digital spaces to enhance the omnichannel experience for customers.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the global gambling group released its full-year 2021 financial report to reveal double-digit growth across digital and strong recovery in retail where volumes have returned to 90% of pre-pandemic levels due to the removal of restrictions and the return of customers to the group’s betting shops.</p>
