    <h1>Vicksburg Mississippi Casinos Emerald Queen Casino Concerts Black Hawk Casinos Tuscany Suites Casino</h1>

<p>Good night,</p>
<p>I have a problem with 1XBET casino, which has my money that I won legally and I can't withdraw it. I have always deposited with crypto, through the USDT (BSC) network, but 3 or 4 times I did it with a debit card. Doing the KYC, I send the photos of my document and they also ask me for the debit card, which I send them without a problem, but when they ask me for the bank statement and the transactions, I send them the ones that my BRUBANK bank allows me and they write me a message saying that they are not going to communicate with me anymore, I call by phone and they tell me that I have a double account, that they must be joined and then pass the security KYC, but I am predisposed to do everything that they ask me and the department of security does not give me answers and besides everything they say that they are not going to communicate with me anymore. It is more than 800 dollars that I am going to lose if this is not solved</p>
<p>Cordial greetings and to the order of what you need,</p>
<p>Baptist</p>
