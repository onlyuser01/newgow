<p>Betano, one of the stars in the Kaizen Gaming galaxy, signed a sponsorship deal with the Chilean soccer club Deportes La Serena. The club was founded in 1955 and is currently 10th in the Chilean Primera Division. Deportes La Serena is the second South American deal by Betano, following last year’s sponsorship of the Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro.</p>
<p>Deportes La Serena president Cristian Contador welcomed the interest in his club by Betano commenting that “it means we are on the right track.”</p>
<p>Expansion in the Right Direction</p>
<p>Betano chief marketing officer Panos Konstantopoulos expressed his optimism in increasing the betting company’s presence in the region and the benefits for local fans, teams, and organizations:</p>
<p>“This sponsorship highlights our strong commitment to the Chilean market, we are determined to continue demonstrating it through our sustained support of Chilean sports and society.”</p>
<p>According to him, expanding to Chile was “the right option.” Kaizen has been increasing its international presence and is currently one of the fastest-growing European gaming companies. The greek company, known in Greece and Cyprus under the label Stoiximan, operates under the name Betano in Germany, Romania, Portugal, Brazil, and now in Chile. The company has 1000 employees, about 260 of them working in the field of technology. Betano offers a variety of services, including online betting, casino, and iGaming content.</p>
<p>Deep Pockets for Serious Clubs</p>
<p>Sponsorships of significant soccer clubs seem to be the trademark move for Betano and Stoiximan brands when stepping into a new market.</p>
<p>Last month the company became the sponsor of Portugal’s FC Porto and established a partnership with Sporting Lisbon until 2023. Betano also has additional partnerships with the Portuguese club SC Braga and CS Marítimo. Since August, the logo of Betano can also be seen on the sleeves of FC Benfica. Betano was also in talks with Sao Paulo in Brazil in early 2021, but the club’s board decided to sign a deal with Sportsbet instead.</p>
<p>Similarly, the betting platform supports clubs such as Fluminense and, since the beginning of 2021, Atlético Mineiro in Brazil. In Greece, the brand backs Olympiacos and PAOK Salonica supported under the Greek skin Stoiximan. Other supported sports teams include Apoel, Omonia, Apollon Limassol, and Pafos FC in Cyprus. FCSB and Universitatea Craiova in România also have sponsorship deals with the international Kaizen brand.</p>
