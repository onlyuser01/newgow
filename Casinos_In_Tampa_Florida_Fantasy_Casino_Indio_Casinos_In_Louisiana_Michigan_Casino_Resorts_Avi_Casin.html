<p>We would like to address the concerns you have raised regarding the account verification process and the confiscation of €3,000. We take our players’ feedback seriously and would like to provide a detailed explanation and resolution for the issues the player encountered.</p>
<p>Account Verification Process:</p>
<p>To ensure a secure and responsible gaming environment, we require our players to complete a verification process. This process includes the submission of specific documents to confirm the player’s identity and the payment methods they have used for transactions. Here are the steps a player needs to pass to withdraw funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proof of Identity: We request a valid Proof of Identity document, such as a National ID Card, Driver's License, or Passport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of Address: We require a Proof of Address document that is no older than 90 days, which can be a bank statement or utility bill that reflects: the name, address, and issuance date of the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of Payment: Depending on the chosen payment method, additional documentation may be necessary. Proof of Payment usually requires a statement that shows the account holder’s name, account number, and transaction details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the player’s case, we needed a photo of the credit card used for deposits that clearly shows the card holder’s name, expiry date, first 6 and last 4 digits, along with a bank statement or a screenshot that reflects the player’s name and IBAN. Proof of IBAN is essential to verify that withdrawals will be processed to the player’s personal bank account.</p>
<p>Once players upload Proof of Identity and Proof of Address documents, our system automatically marks the accounts as KYC passed, allowing them to initiate withdrawals. However, to complete the full verification process, players need to provide the required Proof of Payment documents.</p>
<p>Verification Process Timeline:</p>
<p>We understand that there was a delay in the verification process, primarily due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>Initially, the Proof of Address document provided was older than 90 days, requiring an updated document. We have declined the withdrawal request and informed the player via email about the missing documents for verification.</p>
<p>After the email was sent, the player submitted four documents, but only two of them were approved as proof of the card used to deposit. The remaining two documents did not meet the required criteria.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Proof of IBAN document provided was a screenshot from the bank application, which lacked the account holder’s name.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that this caused frustration, and we apologize for any inconvenience the player has experienced. Our aim is to make the verification process as smooth as possible while ensuring compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Funds:</p>
<p>Regarding the €3,000 mentioned in the complaint, we have thoroughly reviewed the transaction and game history. We found no evidence to suggest that the player reached or came close to this amount. Furthermore, during the player’s interactions with our customer support agents, the player never mentioned anything related to missing funds but mentioned issues related to missing free spins, which were under investigation by our technical team at the time.</p>
<p>We understand that this situation may have left the player dissatisfied, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration experienced during the verification process. It was not our intention for the player to encounter such difficulties with the verification and we understand the disappointment this may have caused. Please know that we are committed to addressing and resolving issues promptly to enhance the overall player experience.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Zip Casino</p>
