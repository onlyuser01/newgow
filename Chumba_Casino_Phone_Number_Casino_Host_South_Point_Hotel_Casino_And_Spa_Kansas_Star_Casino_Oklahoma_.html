<p>IGT and Sightline Take Their Payments Partnership to a New Level</p>
<p>Gaming supplier IGT will expand its partnership with Sightline Payments in order to add its mobile loyalty platform, Joingo, as part of its customer experience. The addition follows an announcement from October that saw the two include Play+ as a funding option for IGT’s land-based cashless gambling options.</p>
<p>Sightline Continues Expansion</p>
<p>Sightline provides cashless gaming services through the award-winning digital platform Play+. This collaboration is in addition IGT’s entire product line, which includes the Advantage management system and Resort Wallet, IGTPay cashless options and the PlaySports platform.</p>
<p>Joingo, which was acquired by Sightline earlier this year, is already used in over 100 US casinos and will continue to be IGT’s preferred mobile app solution. Joingo allows casino brands to create their own mobile apps. Operators can send targeted messages, set geofences and view advanced analytics through Joingo’s cloud-based platform.</p>
<p>Ryan Reddy, SVP Global PM VLT, Systems, Payments &amp; Poker, stated, “As the adoption of cashless solutions continues to grow in our space, questions around mobile app strategy come up more and more. Working with Sightline to offer their industry-leading mobile loyalty platform allows us to answer those questions while giving us the chance to focus on what we do best, providing our partners the best products to deliver the best experience for their customers.”</p>
<p>Cashless Becoming Increasingly Popular</p>
<p>The Play+ Mastercard system was also made available at Resorts World Las Vegas, a US$4.3 billion project that Genting Bhd in Malaysia developed in Nevada. It opened in June.</p>
<p>Genting Group was one of the investors who raised $100 million in June for Sightline to acquire JOINGO. By acquiring JOINGO, Sightline gained the ability to offer its customers a turnkey cashless gaming solution.</p>
<p>Marcus Prater, the executive director of the Association of Gaming Equipment Manufacturers, believes cashless offers a lot of benefits. He commented in September about its role in land-based casinos to step up transaction security.</p>
<p>Kirk Olson, Senior VP Mobile of Sightline, added about the Joingo partnership, “Sightline is constantly looking at ways to innovate to improve the customer experience. Expanding our relationship with IGT enhances our ability to transform the casino gaming industry.”</p>
<p>Sightline and IGT were both honored at the 2021 Global Gaming Awards. IGT was awarded Product Innovation of Year for Resort Wallet and IGTPay. Sightline’s Play+ was named Payment Solution of Year.</p>
