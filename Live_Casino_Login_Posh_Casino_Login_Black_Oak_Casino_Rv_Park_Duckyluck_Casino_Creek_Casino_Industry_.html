<p>Multinational gambling company International Game Technology (IGT) has hired industry veteran Joe Asher to lead its sports betting brand IGT PlaySports. Taking the role of a president of sports betting, Asher will focus on the brand’s expansion on the North American gambling market.</p>
<p>A Passionate Veteran Becomes President of Sports Betting at IGT PlaySports</p>
<p>Asher isn’t just anyone but, rather, a hardened veteran who has been in the industry for more than a decade. Asher began as a founder of Brandywine Bookmaking in 2008 and, in 2012, Brandywine was purchased by William Hill. There, Asher began as CEO, a position he held for almost nine years. However, William Hill US was recently bought by Caesars Entertainment, freeing Asher from his responsibilities. The new president of sports betting has proven himself one who truly loves the sports betting industry. In 2021 Asher became a member of the Sports Betting Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Other than sports betting, Asher has a real passion for horse racing. He’s been the manager of the Harrington Raceway, the Brandywine Raceway, the Foxboro Raceway and the Dover Downs racetracks. To top it off, Asher became the youngest track announcer in the whole of North America. Last year, he came out of retirement to call a race at the Elko County Fair.</p>
<p>As a president of sports betting, Asher will respond directly to Enrico Drago. Drago was recently appointed as the CEO of IGT’s new digital and betting segment. Asher revealed that he is excited to work with Drago and the whole PlaySports team. Asher is looking forward to giving his all and cooperating with his new colleagues in order to help IGT reach new heights.</p>
<p>Asher Vows to Drive IGT PlaySports Forward</p>
<p>Asher hopes to grab the newly presented opportunities by the rapid growth of sports betting. “I have some background working in partnership with PlaySports and I look forward to working with our team to further enhance our technology and trading capabilities to serve our existing and future customers,” Asher stated.</p>
<p>Drago also spoke on the acquisition of Asher as the company’s new president of sports betting. Drago revealed that PlaySports, now powering 50 sportsbooks and for 20 businesses in 18 different states, is looking to continue its growth. The CEO believes that Asher’s knowledge, experience, network and vision for sports betting will be “key ingredients” in IGT PlaySports’ future success.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IGT continues its expansion. The company recently secured a 10-year lottery management contract with the Connecticut Lottery.</p>
