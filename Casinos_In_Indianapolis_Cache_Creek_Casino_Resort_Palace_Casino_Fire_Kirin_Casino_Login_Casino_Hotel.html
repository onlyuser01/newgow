<p>Duelbits has inked a partnership deal with World Snooker Tour for the Duelbits Series in 2023, becoming the title sponsor of all events</p>
<p>The main professional snooker tour that reunites 128 competitors in up to 28 tournaments has made the big announcement right before the debut of the first event part of the World Series. The 2020-launched crypto casino and sportsbook will sponsor all three events in the series.</p>
<p>Word Snooker Tour, Thrilled to Bring Duelbits on Board</p>
<p>Speaking about the new partnership, World Snooker Your (WST) chairman Steve Dawson expressed their thrill to be bringing Duelbits on board for three of their most important tournaments. Dawson also called the series of events “unique”, explaining that players would qualify based on how well they will perform throughout the season.</p>
<p>Accordingly, their huge global audience can expect to witness “snooker of the highest quality”, with only players in the best shape possible able to qualify. The chairman also spoke about the impressively large viewing figures connected to their free-to-air snooker fanbase in the UK recorded via ITV. The latter is the freshest streaming service in the UK.</p>
<p>The three events part of the 2023 Duelbits Series will also benefit from extended live television coverage from the same streaming service that reunites exclusive TV series, shows, blockbuster movies, boxsets, and live events under the same roof.</p>
<p>Other important broadcasters located in different parts of the planet will also air all three events starting with the Duelbits World Grand Prix in Cheltenham between January 16 and January 22 and continuing with the Duelbits Players Championship in Wolverhampton held between February 20 and February 26. Finally, the Duelbits Tour Championship will be organized in Hull between March 27 and April 2, 2023.</p>
<p>All-Time Best Snooker Players Reunited</p>
<p>During all these events, the field will bring together some of the best snooker players of all time, as well as the best players in form. The first 32 players part of a one-year ranking have all successfully made it into the Duelbits World Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Ronnie O’Sullivan will go against other hot names in the sport, including Neil Robertson, Judd Trump, Shaun Murphy, Mark Selby, Mark Allen, and Mark Williams.</p>
<p>The first 16 players will make it into the Duelbits Players Championship that will be held in February. After that, the top eight players will reach the prestigious Duelbits Tour Championship.</p>
<p>Duelbits’ head of sportsbook, Ross Haffie, also explained that the company was “absolutely thrilled to partner with WST” and introduce the Duelbits Series to their players and punters. The company regards the series as a good opportunity to grow its audience using one of the most beloved brands on the planet.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, WTS proved its commitment to fighting corruption in the sport by having two players suspended after being accused of allegedly manipulating games. Last August, Duelbits became Aston Villa’s new European betting partner.</p>
