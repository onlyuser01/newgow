<p>The Green Knight review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on Arthurian medieval fantasy.</p>
<p>In an eerie forest, players will take on an epic quest, finding runes, knights, sorceresses, and, of course, the legendary Green Knight himself. In this realm, magic is possible and myth becomes real.</p>
<p>Those excited about the modern film interpretation of The Green Knight will especially enjoy getting lost in this supernatural world.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is an epic fantasy melody that brings to mind the climatic moment of an adventure. This helps add tension and place the player in the action.</p>
<p>The animation has a vivid high quality that makes it easy to get lost in the game world. Players will find a mythical horse, an ornately designed ax, and an array of celtic runes. Each of these objects suggests a world teeming with ethereal magic.</p>
<p>The Green Knight himself is iconic with shimmering armour adorned with plants. His antlers are especially striking and make it clear that he is a creature of myth.</p>
<p>The forest backdrop gives the game a spooky atmosphere and creates the feeling that players are in the Arthurian legend with the characters.</p>
<p>Overall, the front end of this game does a superb job of illustrating its ancient subject matter. Lovers of the original myth or the more recent film will not be disappointed.</p>
