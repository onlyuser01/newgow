    <h1>Coushatta Casino Hotel Barton S 93 Casino Jackpot Nevada Caesars Casino Promo Code South Point Hotel</h1>

<p>I had played 2 deposit bonuses on 2 different sites, Freshspins and Luckydino. I won about 1800 euros on Freshspins and 3000 euros on Luckydino. I DID NOT BREAK THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN HOW I PLAYED THE BONUSES. They started stalling with my withdrawal and whenever I contacted them, they would say that their payment team is investigating my withdraw. Then, yesterday, they sent me an email saying that based on their terms and conditions, they have the right to close my account. They also wrote in the email that they will confiscate all of my balances, even though the terms and conditions say that they must pay me my money even if they choose to close my accounts. When I contacted them about this attempted robbery, and asked them how I have broken their terms and conditions in my play, they only answer me with an email saying that I can contact EADR and MGA. I have NOT broken any terms and conditions in how I played the bonuses, and they have not provided me with any reason for why they would have the right to not pay my winnings. I realize they have the right to close my accounts but their terms and conditions still say that they have to pay the winnings that belong to me. I am able to download an excel from their site showing that they have cancelled my 1800 euro withdraw. I am unable to log into Luckydino to get the same screenshot since they just closed my account and didn't pay my money. Here is the copy paste of what they sent me in the email:</p>

<p>After this email I asked what the reason for taking my money is and they only answer me with a generic email that tells me to contact EADR or MGA. This is a robbery.</p>
