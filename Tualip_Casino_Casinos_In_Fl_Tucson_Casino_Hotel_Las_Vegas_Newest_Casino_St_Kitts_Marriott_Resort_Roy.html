<p>The partnership with REEVO will help Turbo Games expand the reach of its engaging instant casino games</p>
<p>REEVO, a B2B supplier and aggregator of gaming content, has added a new provider to its aggregation portfolio. As announced, the company will onboard instant games from Turbo Games to its platform, further expanding its library.</p>
<p>Turbo Games describes itself as a future-oriented provider of new-generation trendy games. A subsidiary of Turbo Stars, the company offers reliable instant casino content that will be integrated into REEVO’s aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The deal will vastly extend the distribution of Turbo Games’ titles. At the same time, it will diversify REEVO’s portfolio, making it even richer. This move is in line with REEVO’s strategy to grow its range of games by incorporating more and more games from best-in-class providers.</p>
<p>The aggregator hopes to become a go-to provider of varied gaming experiences, all available to its partners through a single API integration. Because of that, the company recently signed major content deals with other suppliers, with its latest allies being Red Tiger Games and ELA Games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, REEVO also teamed up with Evolution and Booming Games, securing extra content for its aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO’s head of sales, welcomed the addition of Turbo Games to her company’s lineup of content. She noted that the supplier has interesting games that will sit well among the other titles REEVO distributes.</p>
<p>Turbo Games are a really exciting proposition and their games will make a fantastic addition to our expanding range of best-in-class providers available on the REEVO platform. Petra Maria Poola, head of sales, REEVO</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turbo Games’ head of sales, Vadim Potapenko, praised instant games as a great iGaming offering. He said that his team is proud to team up with REEVO and secure access to its exciting and engaging titles. Potapenko’s company described the deal as a “formidable partnership.”</p>
<p>Instant games are a great way for players to explore the iGaming world. We are proud that, together with such a powerful partner as REEVO, we can provide instant access to high-quality games for the public. Vadim Potapenko, head of sales, Turbo Games</p>
<p>Speaking of Turbo Games, the provider continues to target global expansion. Last year, for example, the operator expanded its presence in Latin America by launching games with Cbet. In September 2022, the company also allowed Livespins to use its crash games for its special social casino experiences.</p>
<p>Some of Turbo Games’ more recent agreements include partnerships with companies such as Betbazar, Bojoko and SixSlots.</p>
