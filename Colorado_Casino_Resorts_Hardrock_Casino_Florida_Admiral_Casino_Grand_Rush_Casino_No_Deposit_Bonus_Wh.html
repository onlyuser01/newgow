<p>White House Cocaine Discovery Prompts Odds at Controversial Offshore Sportsbook</p>

<p>An offshore sportsbook has opened up a market on who will be determined responsible for the cocaine found over the weekend inside the White House.</p>

<p>The White House was briefly placed on lockdown Sunday evening after a white powdery substance was found inside the presidential mansion by the Secret Service. A test later confirmed it was cocaine.</p>
<p>Law enforcement said the illegal drug was discovered in a common area of the West Wing, which along with the president’s Oval Office, includes the Cabinet Room, the Situation Room, and the Roosevelt Room. The four-story West Wing additionally houses offices for the vice president and executive branch staff.</p>
<p>The Secret Service said the cocaine was found in a cubby where staffers and some guests regularly leave their cell phones and other personal materials. President Joe Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden were not at the White House when the cocaine was found, but were instead at Camp David before returning to DC on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hunter Heavy Favorite</p>
<p>The cocaine discovery naturally spurred social media gossip that the drug likely belonged to Hunter Biden, the president’s son who has a lengthy history of drug addiction and crack cocaine use.</p>
<p>The misplaced cocaine came a day after Casino.org reported on photographs supposedly from 2018 that allegedly show Hunter Biden driving 172 mph on his way to Las Vegas for an orgy with prostitutes. The photo dump additionally included an alleged photo of the president’s son smoking a crack cocaine pipe while driving in the residential neighborhood of Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>BetOnline, an offshore iGaming platform and internet sportsbook that rarely shies away from offering controversial odds, is taking bets on the owner of the White House cocaine. The book operates out of Antigua and Barbuda, an island nation in the West Indies that’s friendly to offshore gaming businesses.</p>
<p>Hunter is the betting front-runner at +170, or implied odds of 37%. NFL Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, who was at the White House last month, is next at +800. The Jonas Brothers, who also recently visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, are third at +1000.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers think there’s little chance that the president himself misplaced the cocaine. Biden’s odds of being responsible for the cocaine are at +15000, or implied odds of just 0.66%.</p>
<p>The market stipulates that all action will be refunded if the owner is not publicly identified by Aug. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Hunter Happenings</p>
<p>BetOnline has an array of betting opportunities for those wishing to keep tabs on Hunter Biden. The offshore sportsbook has a series of potential things the president’s son might do this year.</p>
<p>The sportsbook has “to go into a rehab clinic” at +800, to announce he’s fathering another child at +1200, and to confirm he’s dating Kim Kardashian at +8000.</p>
<p>Bets are also being accepted for a Hunter Biden move, with China and Ukraine both at +10000. The smattering of relatively humorous odds has the shortest line at +300 for Hunter to be fined by the US Department of Justice.</p>
