<p>Forge of Gems review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Forge of Gems is a slot that takes the player underground, to a room full of hefty industrial furnaces in which mere stones are forged into gems.</p>
<p>The gloomy reels are lit only by the red glow of the coal fires making the shine of the jewels stand out as highlights in the shadows.</p>
<p>The theme of precious stones is a well-worn one in the world of slots, but the brutalist ironworks of the forge makes Forge of Gems stand out in an otherwise saturated genre.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The slot sports some slick animations and sound design. The design team has clearly focused on small, high-quality details — like light running across the gems and dramatic cascade animations.</p>
<p>The result is that the screen is full of little satisfying movements rather than more flamboyant, but perhaps less well-wrought (dare I say "forged") animations.</p>
<p>The visuals are accompanied by an equally low-key soundscape. The background sound is just the rumble of the furnaces, and the spin and win sounds are simple clicks, clacks, and shattering sounds. Once again, variety and quality take the place of scale and flash, making this a very pleasant and relaxing slot to play.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Forge of Gems slot is a five-reel slot with three basic rows and a fourth Forge Reel row.</p>
<p>The basic rows award wins based on an any-way wins system. This means that winning combinations are formed by runs of symbols at any location in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost of those reels.</p>
<p>The cascade system means that winning symbols are removed from the reels and new symbols drop down from above to replace them.</p>
<p>The Forge Reel is at the top and has a series of special symbols. When a cascade causes a special symbol to fall onto the reels, the special symbol is activated. Activated special symbols have several effects, from adding a multiplier to the counter to transforming all the symbols on that reel into Wilds.</p>
<p>The game also has a cap on players winning more than 20,000x their bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except for the Scatter.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels award a randomized bonus. The random bonuses take the form of either a large multiplier for the next spin or a Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>The more Scatters the player lands, the higher the range of multipliers and the number of free spins in the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>3 Scatters = either 10 free spins, 8 free spins, or a 20x multiplier.</p>
<p>4 Scatters = either 15 free spins, 10 free spins, or a 30x multiplier.</p>
<p>5 Scatters = either 20 free spins, 15 free spins, or 10 free spins with a 40x multiplier.</p>
<p>During the Free Spin bonuses, there is never a blank space on the Forge Reel and one of those symbols will always be a multiplier. Additionally, the multiplier counter does not reset after each spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of the Forge of Gems game is 96.20%. This is a little above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%, but not by much.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Forge of Gems is high, which makes it a solid choice for players who follow our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility and RTP.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Forge of Gems is a well-made game that is pleasant to play and sports enough variety in its pacing and bonuses to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>The RTP is at the high end of average and is coupled with high volatility. These features should appeal to more mathematically-minded players, like those who use our slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this slot to anyone who enjoys a precious stone-themed game.</p>
