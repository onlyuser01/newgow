    <h1>Strat Casino Harrah S Cherokee Hotel And Casino Lousiana Casino Ocean Casino Lucky Star Casino Waton</h1>

<p>It’s time for another Crown Jewel event of the 2023 NASCAR season. What we’re talking about is the 2023 Coca-Cola 600 race, which will take place on Sunday, May 28</p>
<p>William Byron of Hendrick Motorsports won Goodyear 400 race two weeks ago despite being fifth on the list of favorites. This time, he’s the second favorite, just behind Kyle Larson, who won this event two years ago. The winner of last year’s Coca-Cola 600 race – Denny Hamlin – is sitting in the shared third place on the favorites list, along with Ross Chastain, Chase Elliott, and Martin Truex Jr.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola 600 Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Kyle Larson +450 William Byron +700 Ross Chastain +900 Chase Elliott +900 Denny Hamlin +900 Martin Truex Jr +900 Christopher Bell +1200 Kyle Busch +1200</p>

<p>Kyle Larson Building Momentum</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that Kyle Larson is the No. 1 favorite to win Sunday’s race at +450. His racing form keeps improving, with one of his best performances happening last weekend when we saw him win the All-Star Race.</p>

<p>Larson also has some good memories from Charlotte Motor Speedway. It was 2021 when he won his first (and so far, only) Coca-Cola 600 event. A year later, he finished ninth, which came as a sort of disappointment. This time, however, he looks determined to set things straight.</p>
<p>The problem for Larson is that there are some other drivers who are at least equally motivated as him. William Byron is definitely one of those, together with Denny Hamlin, Chase Elliott, and even Joey Logano.</p>
<p>Drivers Who Can Crush Larson’s Dreams on Sunday</p>
<p>William Byron is the second favorite to win the 2023 Coca-Cola 600 race, which is no surprise as he’s the one who won the Goodyear 400 race 14 days ago. Then, there’s Denny Hamlin who was impressive at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 2022.</p>
<p>Further, Ross Chastain, Chase Elliott, and Martin Truex Jr all have plenty of experience, so if one of them ended up winning on Sunday, no one would be surprised.</p>
<p>Finally, we mustn’t forget about last season’s champion Joey Logano. Even though he’s been horrible over the last couple of weeks, this guy definitely has the skillset needed to win this race. Plus, he’s very, very motivated to get back on the podium after four disappointing races.</p>
<p>2023 Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR Prediction</p>
<p>It would be crazy not to think of Kyle Larson as the favorite. Not only is he one of the best drivers in the 2023 NASCAR, but he’s also in top shape right now. He did mess things up at Goodyear 400, but he then went on to win the 2023 All-Star Race. And now, Larson seems the right time for him to get back onto the winning track.</p>
<p>Pick: Kyle Larson</p>
