<p>A Classic Theme With a Spin</p>
<p>As explained by Gaming Corps’ head of games, Connor Blinman, the fresh fruity-themed release packed with plum, orange, cherry (low-paying symbols), watermelon, lemon, and grapes (high-paying symbols) is just one of the most recent outcomes of their talented development team’s work. Blinman added that they were “delighted” that the new slot was ready to reach players while calling it a pleasure to use the classic theme appreciated by gamers and give it their own spin.</p>
<p>The head of games took the opportunity to speak about the “momentous year” that the company has recorded, following its plans to expand as a developer and generate versatile content that will continue to remain “at the forefront” of its strategy.</p>
<p>Multiply Wins with the Super Stack, Free Spins, and Bonus Guarantee Features</p>
<p>To score a regular win, players must land a minimum of three identical symbols on the same payline from left to right, starting with the first reel to the left.</p>
<p>For more exciting wins, players need to keep an eye on the Super Hot Stacks feature that can be engaged on random spins. To do this, players need to land the same type of symbol on all three rows.</p>
<p>This will beef up the win multiplier by 1, giving players a 2X multiplier for landing a stack and a maximum of 6X when landing stacked symbols during the base game.</p>
<p>The maximum multiplier is sticky during the Free Spins feature and can reach 25x. To activate the Free Spins feature, players must land at least three scatters. This will trigger seven Free Spins. The feature can be retriggered with up to 50 Free Spins.</p>
<p>Provided players get less than 10x their total bet during the same feature, they will see the Bonus Guarantee get automatically triggered. In turn, they will receive extra Free Spins to keep the reels spinning.</p>
<p>In August, Gaming Corps announced it would provide its games to Pin-UP Casino. The latter operates in Latin American and CIS regions. During the same month, the company said it would supply Sweden’s SuprNation with iconic games like Jet Lucky 2, Coin Miner, and Paddy’s Payout.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps also announced it was getting ready for additional game releases, so fans can look forward to even more “memorable experiences.”</p>
