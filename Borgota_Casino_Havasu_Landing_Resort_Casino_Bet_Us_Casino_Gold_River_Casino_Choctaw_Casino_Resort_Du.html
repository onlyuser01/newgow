<p>Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris has welcomed the exciting opportunity to extend the existing aggregation platform’s offering and said:</p>
<p>We’re always on the lookout to get interesting, unique content, and TopSpin Games certainly supplies that! With its artfully designed coterie of Indian games, their titles are a point of the real difference in the industry and we’re very happy to add them to our Fusion platform.
