<p>American business-to-business gambling products and services provider Scientific Gamer Corporation has inked a content agreement with White Hat Gaming’s USA-oriented casino content brand, White Hat Studios.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios Benefits from Scientific Games’ OpenGaming Platform</p>
<p>The four-year deal will see Scientific Games use its OpenGaming platform as White Hat Studios’ exclusive content aggregator for the United States. As such, OpenGaming will distribute Whitе Hat Studios’ offerings, including RNG table and instant-win games, slots, and more. The deal between the two parties includes the progressive jackpot system Jackpot Royale, which will become available on the platform.</p>
<p>White Hat Studios’ content will be distributed in several states starting 2022. Some of those include Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Depending on how online betting laws and licensing progress in the United States, White Hat’s offerings might eventually become available on other markets as well.</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming’s chief operating officer, Andy Whitworth, spoke about White Hat Studios and its decision to partner with Scientific Games. Whitworth explained that when his team originally conceptualized the idea of White Hat Studios, all of them knew that the right aggregation platform would work miracles for having the brand leave a lasting impression on American bettors.</p>
<p>Whitworth shared that his team firmly believes that OpenGaming is the perfect aggregator for White Hat Studios. The platform’s “unrivaled distribution network and scalability” are exactly what White Hat Studios were looking for, according to Whitworth.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Scientific Games and OpenGaming,” Whitworth concluded.</p>
<p>Scientific Games – a Powerful Ally in the iGaming Industry</p>
<p>OpenGaming allows betting operators with various cutting-edge gaming offerings. Some of the online slot options include trending titles like the Almighty Buffalo Megaways, the Eye of the Dead, and Ted. OpenGaming also gives operators a range of land-based gambling options from Lucksome, Merkur Gaming, and Reel Time Gaming.</p>
<p>Steve Mayes, Scientific Games’ partnership director, spoke on his company’s relationship with White Hat Studios. He revealed that Scientific Games were interested in the casino brand as soon as they first heard of it.</p>
<p>“This is a landmark deal for both parties and will provide our US operators with access to a fantastic suite of slots, table games, and jackpots. It’s a perfect synergy of content, scale, and innovation,” Mayes noted.</p>
<p>Scientific Games’ services are sought after by many operators. Recently the Netherlands Lottery cooperated with the company in order to propel itself further on the newly-launched Dutch betting market. In order to meet the high demands, Scientific Games launched a new center in Leeds to improve its capacities by 20%.</p>
