<p>Sports Information Services (SIS), a leading multi-channel supplier of 24/7 live betting services, has unveiled a big expansion of its presence in Malta thanks to a new agreement. The supplier struck a deal to provide IZIBET, a retail brand owned by the national lottery operator IZI Group, with racing content.</p>
<p>SIS to Power IZIBET with Racing Content</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SIS will power its long-term partner IZIBET with high-quality nonstop horse racing and greyhound racing content from some of the best tracks in the world. The content will be launched at IZIBET’s 200 retail shops all over the island nation.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this deal will greatly expand SIS’ footprint in Malta, allowing the company to provide more local customers with tons of exciting betting opportunities. The racing specialists will provide betting content from 30,000 horse races and 38,000 greyhound races from five continents each year. The content comes packed with an end-to-end solution, live-streamed pictures, data and commentary. In addition, on-screen graphics broadcast various betting markets, allowing racing enthusiasts to never miss a wagering opportunity.</p>
<p>SIS has been steadily expanding its global presence with a variety of deals with notable sportsbooks. At the beginning of this month, for example, the provider made a foray into Chile thanks to its agreement with Estelarbet. A day later, SIS announced a new agreement with Bet365 that saw it launch its esports betting products in New Jersey.</p>
<p>SIS offers a huge selection of betting markets and content, as well as a line of tested revenue-boosting services.</p>
<p>SIS and IZIBET Are Delighted to Deepen their Relationship</p>
<p>Franco De Gabriele, IZI Group’s chief commercial officer, spoke about the agreement. He said that he is very excited to expand his company’s collaboration with SIS and provide National Lottery customers with more content. De Gabriele noted that SIS and IZIBET have worked together for several years now and that he is happy to expand this agreement.</p>
<p>Through the takeover of the National Lottery of Malta earlier this year, we are glad to have extended the SIS horse racing betting service to a network of over 200 outlets across Malta, creating the largest retail sports betting network in Malta under a single brand. Franco De Gabriele, CCO, IZI Group</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dave Richardson, SIS’s commercial manager for the United Kingdom and Europe, said that his company is always looking to work together with “the right brands.” He lauded IZIBET as one such brand, praising it for its presence in Malta.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to be able to offer even more bettors the best racing products currently available. Dave Richardson, commercial manager UK and Europe, SIS</p>
<p>On a separate note, a few weeks ago, SIS was awarded ESIC’s Gold Standards accreditation thanks to its robust and fraud-free esports betting offerings.</p>
