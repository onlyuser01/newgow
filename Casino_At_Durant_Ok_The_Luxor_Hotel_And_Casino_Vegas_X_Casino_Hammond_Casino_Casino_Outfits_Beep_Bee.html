<p>Dear Lumedia,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Could you please forward all the emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly stated the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the self-exclusion section on the website, and this is what I found https://beepbeepcasino4.com/self-exclusion:</p>
<p>„Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Account blocking. You can set the blocking period for 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 3 years, or forever. After that, your account will be blocked and you will not be able to make deposits to the casino or withdraw any remaining funds during this period. While the limit is active, you will be excluded from all promotional offers. After its expiration, your account will be activated automatically.</p>
<p>To block, you can always contact the support service at support@beepbeepcasino.com and inform about your desire to be excluded from the game on the website. The support team will take all necessary measures to restrict such player's access to the website, as well as to protect him from all advertising offers.</p>
<p>Please note that if you self-exclude permanently, the remaining funds on your balance will be paid out in accordance with the casino limits. If you self-excluded for a certain period of time, the remaining funds on your balance will be paid by making an application for withdrawal of funds, after unblocking from your account, in accordance with the casino limits, only after the expiration of the self-exclusion period."</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
