<p>DraftKings continues its foray into the world of blockchain, cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens with the introduction of a new line of NFTs.</p>
<p>DraftKings Marketplace Will Get New NFTs</p>
<p>The new offering will launch as a collaboration between the betting operator and the digital collectibles store Metabilia. As per the agreement between the two parties, a new set of NFTs will be released on DraftKings Marketplace.</p>
<p>The new NFTs are a part of DraftKings Marketplace’s new Membership collection and will feature some of the best rising stars in the world of baseball. Young players such as Fernando Tatís Jr, Joe Musgrove, Ronald Acuña Jr, Shane Bieber, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Wander Franco will appear in the new NFT set.</p>
<p>The new NFT collection will allow baseball fans to take their engagement further and become a bigger part of the world of baseball. The concept alludes to the vintage baseball cards which used to be popular in the 20th century. DraftKings and Metabilia’s new set will allow baseball fans to re-experience the joy of collecting cards and completing a full card collection.</p>
<p>Sports Fans Have Always Had a Thing for Collectibles</p>
<p>Joseph A. De Perio, Metabilia’s chief executive officer, spoke about his company’s vision, saying that he wants to continue delivering high-quality experiences to fans. According to De Period, the new collection allows fans to show their support for a young baseball player and be a part of their journey.</p>
<p>De Perio reasserted that the strategic partnership between Metabilia and DraftKings will see DraftKings Marketplace as the sole distributor of Metabilia’s NFTs, which, he noted, also “incorporate historical pieces of game-used collectibles, career achievements and more.”</p>
<p>Beth Beiriger, DraftKings Marketplace’s senior vice president of product operations, said that fans of sports are always interested in collectibles – a trend that has now found a new form in the digital space. She explained that DraftKings’ ambition is to make its Marketplace the premier destination for such collectibles and new fan experiences.</p>
<p>Beiriger added that Metabilia is the perfect partner to that end, thanks to its expertise with minting NFTs:</p>
<p>Metabilia brings a wealth of capabilities in sports memorabilia and this collaboration represents our latest efforts to immerse fans and form passionate communities around emerging star players. Beth Beiriger, Senior VP of product operations, DraftKings Marketplace</p>
<p>DraftKings Marketplace is one of DraftKings’ most recent initiatives. It was launched in August 2021 after a deal between the operator and Tom Brady’s Autograph platform. In just a few months, the Marketplace has become one of the best platforms for digital sports collectibles.</p>
