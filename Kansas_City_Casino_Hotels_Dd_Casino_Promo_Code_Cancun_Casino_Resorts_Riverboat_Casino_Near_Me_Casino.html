<p>Email communication reveals that the company wants to show its appreciation in a meaningful way for its loyal members</p>
<p>Last month, MGM Resorts International was the victim of a devastating cyberattack. The unprecedented security issue temporarily impacted the operator’s business. Different reports and gaming industry experts suggested the company has been losing millions due to the cyberattack.</p>
<p>Now, it appears MGM Resorts has started emailing customers whose stay was impacted by the cyberattack from September. An email released on the Vegas Message Board forum reveals that MGM Resorts thanked its Rewards Members who stayed or booked their stay last month. The email communication explains that the company plans to reward its loyal members for their recent booking.</p>
<p>Additionally, the email encourages Rewards Members to keep an eye out for further communication and possibly updates on their account balances. While the email doesn’t confirm a timeframe, it explains that this may happen in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>“Your loyalty has not gone unnoticed, and neither has your recent booking. We are hard at work to ensure your loyalty is rewarded for your recent booking to the fullest and more. Be on the lookout for further communication regarding potential updates to your MGM Rewards account balances in the coming weeks,“ reads an email sent by MGM Resorts</p>
<p>The Operator Wants to Show Its Appreciation in a Meaningful Way</p>
<p>According to the newly released email, MGM Resorts thanked its visitors and members for their patience and loyalty during September. The company added that it wants to demonstrate its appreciation “in a meaningful way.” The leading gaming and entertainment giant wrote that it continues to work on ways it can show its appreciation, suggesting that a return visit is a good start. Finally, the email reads: “This is just the beginning, as we have plans in motion for even more that will soon be unveiled. Your loyalty deserves nothing less, and we are eager to demonstrate our gratitude.”</p>
<p>The cyberattack against MGM Resorts started on September 10, 2023. It disrupted the company’s operations in multiple states, including Nevada, Michigan and New Jersey, among others. Due to the cybersecurity issue, some amenities were offline while MGM also had troubles with hotel reservations.</p>
<p>Reportedly, a hacker group known as “Scattered Spired” was behind the latest attack. Besides MGM, another industry giant, Caesars Entertainment, was also impacted by a cybersecurity issue recently.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, in light of the unprecedented cyberattack, MGM Resorts confirmed it anticipates the issue to impact its third quarter 2023 earnings. At the time, the company estimated that the cyberattack may result in a $100 million reduction of its adjusted EBITDAR for September, severely impacting its Q3 results.</p>
