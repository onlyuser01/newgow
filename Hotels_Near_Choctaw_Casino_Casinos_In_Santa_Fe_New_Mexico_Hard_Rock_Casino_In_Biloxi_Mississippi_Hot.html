    <h1>Hotels Near Choctaw Casino Casinos In Santa Fe New Mexico Hard Rock Casino In Biloxi Mississippi Hot</h1>

<p>Apologies this is the full text sent just now to Vickers. The supporting screenshots are in the previous message in this thread.</p>
<p>Apologies any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt reply. Mutch appreciated.</p>
<p>However your absence of any comments raise further serious concerns, and the term " when you're in a hole stop digging, springs instantly into mind"</p>
<p>Please find attached screenshots that show a clear unequivocal proof that you're contradicting yourselves.</p>
<p>You state at the front of your email " Please note, that at no time</p>
<p>did we state that these</p>
<p>documents were insufficient"</p>
<p>Then in the next paragraph you clearly contradict yourselves by saying "On 02/09/2023, your account</p>
<p>triggered our Enhanced</p>
<p>Verification email. This email</p>
<p>requires you to provide</p>
<p>affordability evidence via</p>
<p>email along with requested</p>
<p>information. Your response tc</p>
<p>this email was deemed to be</p>
<p>insufficient and further</p>
<p>evidence and documentation" as we both know this documentation was never provided by me, but you allowed the account to stay open.</p>
<p>Further contradictory evidence is included in a screenshot from an email from yourselves saying my" account was suspended" this is factual and unequivocal.</p>
<p>If AS you are trying to coerce me into believing that my account was suspended following my non provision of supporting documentation, then you must make your mind up!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you state my account was never suspended then why does an email state the contrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you believe you " unsuspended" my account where is the email notification from yourself informing me that my account was suspended but is no longer. Where is this email?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You also extremely worryingly Took thousands without any reality checks. Time out breaks, warnings etc nothing. Why did you not do what your UK licence requires you to do so?</p>
<p>I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO FULLY COOPERATE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ERRORS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AT YOUR HANDS.</p>
<p>THIS MATTER HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR HUGE FINES FOR YOU AND EXTREMELY NEGATIVE BRAND DAMAGING PUBLICITY AND EXPOSURE.</p>
<p>I AM PREPARED TO ACCEPT £510 IN FULL AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF ANY FURTHER CLAIMS AGAINST YOU AND WILL SIGN AN AGREEMENT TO THIS EFFECT.</p>
<p>THIS OFFER IS TIME LIMITED.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS 6PM MONDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER I WILL WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY TAKE ACTION AGAINST YOU BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.</p>
<p>I TRUST YOU WILL NOT RISK YOUR COMPANY AND POTENTIAL LOSS OF LICENCE FOR A VERY SMALL AMOUNT £512.</p>
<p>PLEASE SEE ATTACHED SUPPORTING SCREENSHOTS.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Marc E***</p>
