<p>Cave of Fortune review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a fantasy cave filled with gems.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves deep in a shadowy cavern with only torches to guide them. They’ll hunt down precious gems among the damp rocks and with a little luck escape the underground world.</p>
<p>The game has a vaguely steampunk mood with a railroad track running through the mine. Players in the mood for an escape will like the immersive setting.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>An uplifting tune plays in the background, combined with the echoes of water droplets falling. Players will definitely get the sense of being deep in the earth for the duration of the gameplay.</p>
<p>The cave setting is beautifully animated with stoney walls arching around the reels. A bright light suggests the mouth of the cave while flame torches illuminate the interior.</p>
<p>The game’s host is a gremlin-like miner with a half-melted candle atop his head. He smiles mischievously at the start of the game, ensuring that players feel welcome.</p>
<p>The reels are packed with well-cut jewels in tempting colours. Rubies, diamonds and amethysts all sparkle and look ready for the taking.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and music work well to create a friendly fantasy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cave of Fortune is a five reel, three row slot, with 30 win lines.</p>
<p>Above each reel sits a counter which accumulates Nitro symbols. Gathering Nitros leads to bonuses (explained below).</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>When players collect 3 Nitro symbols in the counter above the reels, they are awarded a Persistent Wild feature. This means that the reel below the counter will transform into a Persistent Wild reel for the following 3 games.</p>
<p>If players achieve a Persistent Wild in all 5 reels at the same time, they will receive a x200 their total bet.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol may appear on any reel, though only one may appear on each reel. When players land 3 Scatters, they will be awarded 10 free spins. The number of free spins increases to 15 if players land 4 Scatters, and to 20 if players land 5 Scatters.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, players will be granted a Grand Nitro Meter, which accumulates Nitros. If players accumulate 15 Nitros in this meter, the Grand Jackpot is awarded, meaning x500 the players' total bet.</p>
<p>The Explode feature is triggered at random while players are in the Free Spins feature, providing that the Grand Nitro Meter has reached a count of at least 3. This means that Bomb Wild symbols will be positioned on the reels at random.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.04%, roughly our average yardstick for the industry.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 up to a maximum of $/£/€60.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this medium RTP, high volatility fantasy cave-themed slot.</p>
