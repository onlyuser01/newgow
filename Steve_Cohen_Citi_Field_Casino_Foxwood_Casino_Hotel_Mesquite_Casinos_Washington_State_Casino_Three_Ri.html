<p>Genius Sports has teamed up with the National Lacrosse League (NLL) to launch a new F2P pick’em game. The NLL Pick ’Em Challenge will be available during the 2021-2022 season, and it will seek to elicit engagement with fans of the sport, offering new ways to get and feel involved with the outcome of games and the action itself.</p>
<p>Genius to Help Boost Engagement Through F2P Solutions</p>
<p>As many organizations have vowed to stop promoting betting-like activities in sports in places such as Australia, US sports leagues and operators are exploring the F2P model in a bid to offer viewers new experiences. The NLL is finding another way to engage, though, exploring specific consumer preferences that test people’s knowledge of the game and their grasp of it.</p>
<p>The Genius Sports-powered solution will offer lacrosse fans the opportunity to participate in a ten-question quiz every week, leading to the weekend action. That will translate into a chance for fans to win real money prize to the tune of $10,000 if they get all questions right in any of the regular season weeks.</p>
<p>NLL commissioner Nick Sakiewicz sees NLL Pick ’Em as an opportunity to further build upon the relationship between fans of the game and the organization. He believes that such initiatives will help make the game more accessible and popular with audiences in both Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>“NLL Pick ‘Em is another way that fans can stay engaged with the league and its players on a deeper level, encouraging greater knowledge of the game and rewarding our most loyal supporters.” NLL commissioner Nick Sakiewicz</p>
<p>Genius Sports will similarly work on the NLL Summer Polling Challenge, which will seek fans’ opinions on a variety of topics that the organization hopes will help it understand consumer and fan preferences better.</p>
<p>Future Looks Bright for Lacrosse in the US</p>
<p>Lacrosse is actually enjoying fairly strong popularity in the United States. It ranks as the third highest-ranking league in the country when it comes to attendance amongst professional indoor competitions.</p>
<p>The latest Pick ‘Em game is part of a deeper connection between the two companies. Genius Sports has been working with the NLL since October 2019. Back then, Genius Sports focused on studying betting activity placed on NLL games to try and determine if there were any shortcomings insofar as the integrity of the sport was concerned.</p>
