<p>Global gambling group Entain announced that the Entain Foundation has launched an NFT auction aimed at promoting responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Creative and Fun Way to Promote Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>The new NFT series titled “Superheroes of Responsible Gambling” was launched in partnership with the Charles Oakley Foundation, the charity founded by former NBA player Charles Oakley, and the proceeds of the NFT sales will be donated to the foundation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the NFT auction, Martyn Lycka, senior vice president for North American Regulatory Affairs at Entain, outlined the launch as “a creative and fun way” for the gambling group “to promote the very serious message of Responsible Gambling to all audiences.”</p>
<p>“My post-NBA work is focused on preventing problems among underserved groups. This is one way to reach people where they are, using tools that they use, to provide a positive message about responsible gambling,” Lycka added.</p>
<p>Further, the launch is considered the company’s approach to “tech-savvy audiences” actively participating and contributing to the growth of the sports betting industry. According to Lycka, who featured as one of the NFT characters in the series, the NFT range was designed via methods, tools, and programming aligned with the current state of technology and communications industries.</p>
<p>Designed by Enlighting Media, the NFT range also features the founder of Wager Score Bo Grey, international responsible gambling consultant Briann Doura-Schawohl and the partner at Princeton Public Affairs Group Bill Pascrell III.</p>
<p>The online player protection service providing real-time affordability data and contributions to designated charities, Wager Score, also collaborated with Entain Foundation for the new NFT auction.</p>
<p>Building on Previous NFT Launch</p>
<p>The new NFT range is the second digital collectible launched by Entain in 2022, following the launch in June of its first series of nine NFTs representing the markers of gambling disorder.</p>
<p>“These NFTs are a memorable, digestible way to teach people how to recognize the nine markers of a gambling problem,’ said Lycka at the time of the launch.</p>
<p>The nine NFTs that were made available for purchase on OpenSea, with the sales proceeds donated to the Oakley Foundation, featured visuals such as calendar days, to imply multiple player depositing days, and blinking eyes symbolizing late-night play. The NFTs were also correlated with Entain Foundation’s responsible gambling app, Gamble Responsibly America.</p>
<p>The NFT auction is the latest effort undertaken by the global gambling group in the responsible gambling space, following shortly after the announcement of Entain Foundation’s campaign aimed at gaming and esports, MindYourGame.</p>
