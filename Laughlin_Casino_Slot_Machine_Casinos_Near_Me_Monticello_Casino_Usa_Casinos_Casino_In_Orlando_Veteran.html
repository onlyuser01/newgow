<p>Gambling addiction, just like addiction to drugs or alcohol can have a devastating impact. A study that is due to be released soon sheds light on the connection between gambling addiction and suicide attempts among Australian veterans</p>
<p>A new report released by the Guardian reveals details regarding research that probed into gambling addiction among veterans in Australia.</p>
<p>Gambling Addiction Results in Suicide Attempts for One in Five Veterans</p>
<p>The study led by Dr Olivia Metcalf is yet to be published, but what’s known so far is that one in five veterans addicted to gambling has attempted suicide. The new research uncovered that approximately 40% of the veterans in Australia that are suffering from gambling addiction had experienced suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Additionally, the study uncovered that veterans are significantly more vulnerable to developing gambling addictions when compared to the civil population. Dr Metcalf pointed out that within the first five years of ending their military service, some 13% of the veterans showed signs of addiction.</p>
<p>According to Dr Metcalf, the study uncovered a disturbing trend for veterans, especially considering that they may be more vulnerable to suicide when compared to the other population. “That statistic is particularly high and while we don’t have great comparable civilian data, it looks like the rate among veterans is higher,” she explained.</p>
<p>Changes to Gambling Face Rejection, but Concerns about Harm Remain</p>
<p>Details of the upcoming study emerged after only recently, New South Wales RSL and Services Clubs showed disapproval of proposed changes related to cashless gaming cards. Karen Webb, the NSW police commissioner, showed approval for cashless gambling in an effort to fight against crimes such as money laundering. Cashless technology can significantly reduce the possibility of such crimes. At the same time, technology can be beneficial and help curb the rate of problem gambling. However, the proposal caught the attention of RSL Clubs which voiced their disapproval. NSW RSL and Services Clubs’ CEO, Margot Smith, disagreed with the proposed changes to gambling and called for a “balanced view of gambling.”</p>
<p>RSL Clubs have been operating for more than two decades. The locations are established in an effort to provide “current and ex-serve personnel and their families to enjoy a safe and comfortable place to gather.” Yet, many of those locations offer poker machines which not unexpectedly raises eyebrows.</p>
<p>According to Professor Malcolm Battersby, Flinders University’s head of psychiatry, who happened to participate in the aforementioned research, it is worrying to see RSL Clubs offer gambling services. Battersby said that such locations offering gambling are “exploiting vulnerable people who are most likely to contribute to gambling losses and harm to themselves.” Considering that those clubs are after providing care and support for current and ex-servicemen and women, raking profits from gambling is against their prime goal, said the professor in conclusion.</p>
