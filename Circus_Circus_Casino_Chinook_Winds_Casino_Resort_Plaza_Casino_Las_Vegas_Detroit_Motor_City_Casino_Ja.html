    <h1>Circus Circus Casino Chinook Winds Casino Resort Plaza Casino Las Vegas Detroit Motor City Casino Ja</h1>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>The following situation occurred with this player:</p>
<p>The player won a certain amount, after which, in order to withdraw funds, it is required to go through standard account verification.</p>
<p>We asked the player for a standard set of documents for verification. After some time, the player sent this set of documents and successfully passed the verification.</p>
<p>Next, the player (based on the rules of the casino, with which he agreed) had to confirm the phone number, with which the player had problems. The player did not receive the SMS code, which he told us on the same day (please note that we answered almost always on the day the player applied, although now it is holidays and there are also people working in the casino who sometimes need rest). We checked this information and confirmed that he did not receive the SMS code and verified the number manually.</p>
<p>But the whole problem happened later, when we asked the player to provide a card number in order to send him money, since the payment system that automatically withdraws money refused to pay (this happens with some countries), and therefore we have to request a card number in order to manually through an alternative method to withdraw money.</p>
<p>The player refused to provide the card number for a long time (please note that only the card number, without the back 3 digits). After that, late in the evening, he provided the data and we confirmed that we will withdraw to the player tomorrow (since it was already late in the evening, and our casino has a working hours for the financial department and the player must read the rules of the casino, because he agreed with them).</p>
<p>To the message that only tomorrow the player will be paid the funds, the player was very outraged and began to claim that we were scammers and requested his card details in order to deceive him and steal money from him in the future. On the same day, the player asked to block his account and he does not want to have anything to do with us. To which our employee clarified with the player that he has money in his account and in case of blocking he will lose this money. In the future, the player (on the same day) simply lost his money and again demanded blocking, without actually waiting 24 hours for us to withdraw the funds.</p>
<p>I will ask you to note that this whole story lasted about 5 days, which is not a long time on holidays, and given the fact that the player had to go through verification, resolve the issue with the SMS code and provide the card details.</p>
<p>We did not waste time and honestly provided all the information exactly on the same day the player wrote to us. In response, we received only insults and messages that the player had turned to the police and that we were scammers, which is completely wrong.</p>
<p>I hope i was able to summarize this situation as much as possible for all parties.</p>
