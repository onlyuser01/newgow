    <h1>The Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort And Casino Virgin River Hotel And Casino Sycuan Casino Resort Wh</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal of â‚¬1623 on 27th July. After a few days, the withdrawal appeared as "successful" in my player account.</p>
<p>However, I never received the payout. Following days of discussion, I received a copy of the "payout check," but the IBAN was partially obscured.</p>
<p>I took this to my bank, but they confirmed there was no such transaction. Consequently, I was asked to send four weeks' worth of bank statements. I did this, but received no response.</p>
<p>After yet another discussion, they now wanted statements from the last eight weeks.</p>
<p>When I attempted to send these today, I found that my account had been blocked. This was the absolute climax of the situation. However, I was still able to send the statements through the online chat. The blocking of my account is now clear evidence that there will likely be no resolution to this issue.</p>
<p>The casino is now in possession of my bank statements for the last eight weeks.</p>
<p>I am not willing to forfeit my money, hence why I am trying to resolve my issue here.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, my last resort would be to get my lawyer involved, although I'm unsure of the potential outcomes.</p>
<p>I have been playing at this casino for years, usually without any significant issues.</p>
<p>A few months ago, there was a similar issue, but the casino resolved it. However, it involved a smaller sum of money.</p>
<p>The current blocking of my account is an absolute insult to me.</p>
<p>I cannot understand it, as I have been a long-standing customer.</p>
<p>I hope to find help here.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
