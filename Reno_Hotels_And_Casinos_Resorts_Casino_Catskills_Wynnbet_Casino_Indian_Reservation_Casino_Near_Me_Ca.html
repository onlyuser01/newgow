    <h1>Reno Hotels And Casinos Resorts Casino Catskills Wynnbet Casino Indian Reservation Casino Near Me Ca</h1>

<p>So I got a bonus code for 40 free spins the bonus code was BITGATE and the instructions were when you make a deposit enter the bonus code right underneath where you make the deposit and then continue with your deposit and once your deposit goes through you will be credited the free spins there was no deposit amount and so I did that and said applied I made sure I followed the directions to achieve and made my deposit my deposit went through I I was not credited the free that was two days ago I talked to support till I was blue in the face and I emailed Nick who supposedly head of the casino yesterday on the same place where I got the first bonus code from I in the same exact way made another deposit with the bonus code wild Chicago 30 for 30 free spins from wild Chicago the game I followed the directions the same way made the deposit the deposit went through and I was credited 33 spins for wild Chicago I then did a screen recording of the and how that when you enter the bonus code and if it applies it to your account it lights up green meaning it is active and if it doesn't then it lights up red and says not available for your account I never received the 43 spins and Nick and the casino support team are telling me that that's not how you enter bonus codes well then there shouldn't be that option available and the fact is that's false advertisement which is against the law I added in screenshots of where I entered the bonus code and the bonus code word applies it to it and says active where it shows up green and then I also included a screenshot of a bonus code that's not valid and how it lights up red and that if that's not how you enter the bonus codes then the option shouldn't be there and the if that wasn't how you do it where I got the bonus codes from that was their directions on how to do it they wouldn't promote that and the fact that they do and it went through the second time but not the first time and they're not trying to honor it is false advertisement</p>
