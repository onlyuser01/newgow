    <h1>Boston Billiard Club Casino New York New York Hotel And Casino Casino Pier Photos Cache Creek Casino</h1>

<p>I never deposited on this prima play site and the last time I talked to them was yesterday when I sent my documents to verify my identity, right there they ask you to print a term that is in PDF reply to yourself take a picture of it take a picture with a selfie with him take a photo of the ID proof of address and when I signed up I got 50 and also I don't think that even here it specifies what you have to do there I get about 50 that the bonus wasn't entering with a code either I had to talk to one of the attendants, then the term was activated below. I will be showing it if the 50 of the bonus and you have to make 2,500 turn to zero And then the amount that remains becomes real money, but it only shows there 50 and below 2,500 And that's all it wasn't showing any other bonus it's not showing how to make the bonus turn into real money and I was playing and I managed to make the money turn into real there after I made the complaints with the attendant after it turned into real money there The it seemed like a specification for me to be able to withdraw the money because at the beginning it wasn't showing anything it wasn't talking about your team that after having money you weren't asking to do anything real and that's it, then, after nothing, it appeared there in the term that I had to deposit 75 dollars in Bitcoin means I made 65 I made the money become real 65 and the term they want me to be able to withdraw the money that I deposit 75 dollars in Bitcoin that then I can take the money and withdraw the money that I earned but at first it wasn't showing any of that I looked I already looked on their page I didn't find anything that I had to deposit some money then out of nowhere it appeared then I managed to make the money turn real out of nowhere it appeared that I had to deposit R$ 75 dollars even more than I I have to deposit R$ 75, it's more than I managed to make it real. i 25 bonus to be able to play there i played with the bonus they gave me i went to this bonus here o MGN2PP i redeemed the bonus there it gave 25 and then the minimum was r$ 750 that i had to make it real it was 75 the machine took the bonus was not even enough to complete the goal the 60 dollars I won it's like I had withdrawn there, right but they didn't release that they want me to deposit now 100 dollars that we were 75 dollars now they want me to deposit $100 and I took it, I played it, I made the bonus turn into real money, it wasn't specifying that I had to deposit some amount to be able to withdraw it, I just had to make the money turn into real money and that's it, now they're asking for 100 dollars so I managed to do the real thing and there it wasn't I was asking for nothing for a deposit now I just want the amount I won you know because it seems like it's a prank but it seems like a scam for the person not being able to win what she got understood if the money became real and it's withdrawable money there's no problem there Now they are putting up a lot of obstacles for me to not be able to withdraw the money now he was asking for 75 now it turned to in a little while they ask for 200 stone in 300 it is money that I cannot deposit because I don't have it And then I don't win my prize I would like some help, understand why I won the bonus I managed to make the tram become real so I would like to know who can help me on this subject, understand why they are only increasing the deposit amount. high amount that I can't deposit so there's no money if I played with the bonus to become real and I managed to make the bonus become real I would simply like to withdraw the prize that I won and they don't want to let me so I'm asking for your help there because I think this is very unfair, you know, if they give you a chance to earn money and make the money real, when you manage to make the money real, then they put a lot of value for you to have to deposit so you can withdraw the money if I won the money because I can't withdraw the money without having to deposit anything then they're just increasing the value an amount that I can't afford to pay, you know 75$100 soon they increase the amount so I can't get the bonus that turned into a balance that I won because they are just increasing the deposit amount and asking me to get the bonus the prize that is not a bonus is real money that's why I I think it's very strange, a lot of blows, you know And I even did the crazy thing of sending my documents to them to check I'd just like some help from you because that way I wouldn't be getting into this if I didn't need it I think it's fair to me I managed to withdraw the money I managed to make in real life, you always have to deposit some money</p>
