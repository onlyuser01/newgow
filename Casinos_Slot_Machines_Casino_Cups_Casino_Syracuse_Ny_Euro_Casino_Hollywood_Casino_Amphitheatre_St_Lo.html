<p>SIS, Sports Information Services, has extended its partnership with NetBet, which will now include horse racing content provided 24/7 through the company’s Live Betting Channels. This collaboration will be an important step forward for both companies as they seek to consolidate and innovate their existing offering.</p>
<p>Horse Racing Content Now Part of NetBet’s Offer</p>
<p>SIS has already been a partner for NetBet for several years, with the companies working in a number of jurisdictions, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, and North America, and covering greyhound racing. SIS offers NetBet its Watch and Bet model which makes it possible for sports fans to view and bet on racing content as it happens.</p>
<p>Moving forward, NetBet customers will also have access to SIS’ exclusive UK and Irish horse racing live. This includes international horse racing from a number of additional jurisdictions, such as Latin America and the United States, Dubai, Canada, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Mauritius and not least, Hungary. Overall, there will be 65,000 live horse and greyhound racing events each year covered by SIS and shared with NetBet.</p>
<p>SIS provides its 24/7 Live Betting Channels as a fully-fledged end-to-end solution, including on-screen graphics, betting triggers, and more. This makes the integration simple and clear-cut. Commenting on this new opportunity, SIS commercial manager Dave Richardson said that the company has enjoyed its partnership with NetBet so far and was happy to be building up:</p>
<p>With the best in live pictures and data being delivered from the world’s leading racetracks, NetBet will be able to offer their customers a truly engaging betting experience, with an event available to bet on through our 24/7 Live Betting Channels every three minutes. SIS commercial manager Dave Richardson</p>
<p>NetBet head of sportsbook Peter Camden similarly welcomed the partnership. He outlined the beginning of the two companies’ journey together through greyhound content which has now evolved to feature high-quality horse racing coverage as well.</p>
