<p>FanDuel, a leading American gambling company, has announced that it will invest $15 million and more in an Atlanta office and hire +900 people.</p>
<p>FanDuel to Spend $15 Million on Offices in Atlanta</p>
<p>FanDuel, a giant in the gambling industry, has said that it plans to invest at least $15 million in a new Atlanta office and hire more than 900 people, focusing on innovation, production, and technology. FanDuel is a subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc, a UK-based international leader in the industry. It has a platform available in 10 states, excluding Georgia.</p>
<p>Flutter bought most of FanDuel’s shareholders last year, for $4.2 billion, after buying 58% of it in 2018. FanDuel also offers sports betting in land-based casinos in some states. Sports betting is permitted online inside casinos in 11 states and the District of Columbia. The company has more than 12 million US clients, with US headquarters in Los Angeles, New York, and Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>Georgia lawmakers tried to oppose the legalization of sports betting, despite Atlanta’s professional sports teams, who wanted to have more fan engagement.</p>
<p>FanDuel to Recruit Students from Local Campuses</p>
<p>FanDuel would look for ways to create courses and train future employees at Georgia’s universities. It will actively recruit students from local campuses. According to officials, it is not yet clear when FanDuel will set up in Midtown Atlanta, but the state has promised assistance with the job training. The company will create workshops for future employees, residents of the state.</p>
<p>FanDuel Set on Growth Trajectory in US</p>
<p>FanDuel could soon launch its fantasy sports betting products in Louisiana as lawmakers are getting closer to giving it the green light. According to the company’s government affairs director Stacie Stern, FanDuel is negotiating the launch of its products in the state. Sports fans may soon see an exciting football season with FanDuel’s launch.</p>
<p>FanDuel recently signed a partnership deal with The Ringer, intending to provide its audiences with a more engaging gaming experience. The companies will focus on promoting each of their assets. The partnership will last until February 2022.</p>
<p>In April, Scientific Games extended its OpenSports to FanDuel in Illinois and Indiana, making them the third and fourth states. SG will offer its dedicated OpenSports platform to FanDuel Group. Flutter and Scientific Games have been partners for the past 20 years.</p>
