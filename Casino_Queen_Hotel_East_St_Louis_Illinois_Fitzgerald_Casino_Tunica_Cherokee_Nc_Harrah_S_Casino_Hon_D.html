    <h1>Casino Queen Hotel East St Louis Illinois Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Cherokee Nc Harrah S Casino Hon D</h1>

<p>Dear Yanki2000,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://24vipcasino.com/promotions-terms:</p>
<p>"No-Deposit Welcome Bonuses in the amount of $39 or less carry a maximum withdrawal of $50. Bonuses in amounts of $40 and higher have a maximum withdrawal of $75 except where explicitly stated otherwise."</p>
<p>As soon as the wagering requirements have been completed your winnings became withdrawable. They don’t turn into real money, au contraire, they still carry maximum cash out of $50. For future references, my advice would be to withdraw your No Deposit winnings as soon as they become withdrawable and do not accumulate any more winnings with deposited funds. This deposit is only for your payment method to be verified and for you to withdraw your No Deposit winnings.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play, especially when it comes to No Deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help. Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
