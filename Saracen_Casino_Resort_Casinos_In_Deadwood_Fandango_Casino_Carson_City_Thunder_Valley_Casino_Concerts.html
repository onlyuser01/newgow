    <h1>Saracen Casino Resort Casinos In Deadwood Fandango Casino Carson City Thunder Valley Casino Concerts</h1>

<p>I rejoined here recently after constantly losing at the beginning of this year, I took a match bonus and deposit $105. This coupon came with a x20 max cash out. I played it and after completing my play thru I finally won. The casino automatically removed the bonus and I was left with a small win of $1761. I then made a withdrawal for a bank wire for this amount. I then received an email that they need my documents. 90% of casinos allow me to block my ID numbers on my drivers license. I really don't like giving that info out so it kind of made me mad. On the withdrawal page it allows players to reverse their withdrawal and play again. That is what I did. I reversed the $1761 and played it and surprisingly I won an additional $1250. So that brought my total to $3011. I then made a new withdrawal for my new winnings. $3011.</p>
<p>It was in my account as requested. A day later I was able to make a deposit even though I had a pending withdrawal. I even asked chat if that was ok. I made a deposit of $150 and won an additional 500. That brought me up to around $3600. I then reversed the withdrawal again and added up my new total and made a new withdrawal. You can only have one withdrawal at a time. I sent all the documents in that they wanted and I was approved. On Sept 9th I received an email that my request for payout has been sent. The total out of $3600 was only $2205. Apparently they paid my original win of 1761 plus the $444 from my deposit. The numbers really aren't adding up for some reason but I have all the documents. I contacted them immediately and they said that since I reversed my initial withdrawal and played the money then the original bonus gets reactivated to any new monies won with that money. They said it is in their T&amp;C's. I asked Sally to point me in the direction where I can see this in your T&amp;C's. Sally said I will have to find them myself. Well I looked and could not anything that has to do with my situation. They offer you to reverse your winnings. That original win with a bonus match was finished and the casino's bonus was removed already. They should say if you won this money with a bonus and you decide to reverse your withdrawal then the bonus will reactivate to the rules of the bonus. Well it doesn't say anything about this. Today I finally after 8 business days received my $2205. They took the $1250 plus out of my winnings.</p>
<p>This is my complaint.</p>
