<p>Americas Cardroom or ACR takes an important place in the pantheon of online poker sites in the USA. In fact, as far as real money poker options and the poker community go, the Winning Poker Network on which Americas Cardroom is based is the second-largest in the US.</p>
<p>ACR has a very strong focus on the American market and this is by design. Over the years, the website has managed to get a new coat of paint and provide players with solid poker games and tournaments, not least some of the largest US events online, such as The Venom and The Cage.</p>
<p>The card room has a great variety of No-Limit Hold’em games and includes both low and high-stake games. Most games start at $0.25/0.50 and $0.05/0.10 and can quickly progress to $25/$50. ACR continues to offer a variety of tourneys, which is one of its biggest hooks with Venom Fever, Cyclones, and Sunday Special PLO just some of the worthwhile additions.</p>
<p>We take on the full online poker site in our dedicated Americas Cardroom review below. Buckle your seatbelts, because we will talk about game variety, safety, banking, and more.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Review: Pros and Cons</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom is a top destination for US players, not only because of the name but also because of the way the poker site was executed. Before we proceed with the actual review, we will take a look at ACR’s strengths.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>A global operator with a particular focus on the USA</p>
<p>Great $1,000 welcome bonus for poker players</p>
<p>A variety of poker games and variants to try</p>
<p>Over 60 cryptocurrencies and traditional payments</p>
<p>Quick withdrawals and a legitimate offer</p>
<p>Works very well on Android, iOS and mobile devices</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Some concerns about bots</p>
<p>No mobile app available</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Bonuses</p>
<p>The Americas Cardroom welcome bonus is decent. It’s modeled after the majority of similar bonuses you will find on other websites. The bonus offers a 100% matched rate up to $1,000 as soon as you deposit $25. However, if you do decide to dive a little deeper into the website from the get-go, you can deposit with one of the 60+ available cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>That would allow you to claim a 200% bonus up to $1,000 and essentially provide you with a better match rate. The bonus is then released to players like any US card room would. You will release your bonus in increments of $1 for every 27.5 Awards Points Earned (AP).</p>
<p>You have 60 days to release the full bonus amount. Any funds left after that will be forfeited automatically. Americas Cardroom has a very clear-cut structure as to how APE is received. Players can either win them in tournaments or cash games.</p>
<p>You receive 5.5 AP for every $1 paid in fees and 5.5 AP for each $1 in rake generated on ACR. The rest of the promotional offers available on ACR mostly have to do with the upcoming tournaments which often feature sizeable chunks of cash prizes to help boost your profits along.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Promo Codes</p>
<p>ACR is no stranger to the occasional promo code send your way. In fact, you will run across several bonus codes on different occasions. If you don’t necessarily want to play using an Americas Cardroom promo code, you don’t have to, as the site has mostly shed those off and replaced them with an intuitive point-and-click system of acquiring bonuses.</p>
<p>Claim ACR Elite Benefits</p>
<p>ACR offers a chance to scale your experience by reaping benefits from your gameplay at a natural pace. In Elite Benefits, players can get exclusive live entries, cash bonuses, and more. Your rating depends on Rank Points (RP) you accumulate to scale through the six available levels, from Lieutenant to a 5-Star General. There are various rewards available for purchase, including the $50, $300, and $600 cash packages.</p>
<p>Calculate Your Rake</p>
<p>One of the great things about Americas Cardroom is the website’s transparency. You can always have a good idea of what the rake levels are. The rake is a small fee that the card room charges to maintain operations, support prize pools, and offer a quality service.</p>
<p>The rake percentage will vary based on the version of the game, i.e. Pot Limit vs No-Limit Hold’em, and Omaha, and based on how many players are joining. Check the following table to break down the rake levels at ACR:</p>
<p>Stakes 2 Players / CAP 3-4 Players / CAP 5 Players / CAP $0.02/$0.04 4.5% / $0.01 4.5% / $0.01 4.5% / $0.01 $0.04/$0.08 4.5% / $0.04 4.5% / $0.04 4.5% / $0.04 $0.05/$0.10 4.5% / $0.04 4.5% / $0.04 4.5% / $0.04 $0.10/$0.20 4.5% / $0.10 4.5% / $0.10 4.5% / $0.10 $0.25/$0.50 4.5% / $0.16 4.5% / $0.16 4.5% / $0.16 $0.50/$1 4.5% / $0.40 4.5% / $0.40 4.5% / $0.40 $1/$2 2% / $0.50 3% / $0.70 4% / $0.80 $2/$4 2% / $0.50 3% / $0.70 3% / $1.25 $3/$6 to $5/$10 2% / $0.50 3% / $2 3% / $3 $10/$20 2% / $0.50 2.5% / $2 2.5% / $3 $15/$30 2% / $1 2% / $2 2% / $3</p>
<p>Contributing to the rake back isn’t that bad at all. Americas Cardroom has devised a way to keep the community happy by offering a fair contribution to the weekly tournament known as The Beast.</p>
<p>The Beast is fed by the community’s rake and the prize pools often swell to multi-million offerings that are a sure indicator of the community’s strength and ACR’s own vibrance as an online poker provider.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Banking Methods</p>
<p>Banking has been one of the most important aspects of any poker site. Since ACR is located offshore, having a prompt banking service is essential. Presently, the website uses five options to facilitate deposits and withdrawals, including Bitcoin and crypto transfers, Person 2 Person, e-wallets, credit and debit cards, and checks.</p>
<p>Players can deposit using any of those methods and depositing between $10 and $25,000 per single transaction. Here are what each method is worth and how much you can deposit with it at ACR:</p>
<p>Deposit Method Min/Max Deposit Notes Bitcoin &amp; crypto transfers $10/$25,000 Deposits may take up to 8 hours to process Person 2 Person $50/$500 – E-wallet $10/$25,000 – Credit/Debit Cards *Depends on the card Visa deposits are charged 10% Checks Not available –</p>
<p>Checks aren’t available as deposit methods but they do come in handy for withdrawals. Americas Cardroom withdrawals are easy enough.</p>
<p>Unlike other poker sites, you still have very high withdrawal limits, that will make any cashouts pleasant, quick, and meaningful.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Method Min/Max Withdrawal Notes Bitcoin &amp; crypto transfers $50/$10,000 24-72 hours per payout Person 2 Person $100/$500 3-5 days per payout E-wallet $10/$5,000 Cashout reviews up to 72 hours Credit/Debit Cards – Not available for cashouts Checks $100/$3,000 Checks may take up to 15 business days and charge a $65 fee</p>
<p>Clearly, the best payment option you can use is Bitcoin as it allows the quickest and most generous withdrawals. The downside with this payment method is the price fluctuations as well as the fact you need to be slightly more tech-savvy to use it.</p>
<p>Game Variety and Poker Versions</p>
<p>There are many games you can test at Americas Cardroom. Players are free to explore popular cash games, with limits ranging from $0.02/$0.04 to $15/$30 and quite often more. The card room has featured worthwhile options such as No-Limit Hold’em, Pot Limit Omaha, PLO/8, and a whole lot of others.</p>
<p>The quickest way to find your way to the top games is to have a quick browse through the lobby. Some tables might even allow you to participate in $5,000 buy-in games, which are earmarked for all highroller out there. The selection of games is quite wholesome when you think about it. You can pick from:</p>
<p>Hold’em</p>
<p>Omaha &amp; Stud</p>
<p>Blitz Poker</p>
<p>Jackpots</p>
<p>Tourneys</p>
<p>Sit &amp; Go</p>
<p>Most tables are usually 6/6 or 9/9 players each. Another detail we appreciate about Americas Cardroom is you can always see what the average pot in any given game is. There is even an estimated hands-per-hour stats to give you a good estimate of how quickly you can roll through your bonus, for example.</p>
<p>Some games have a very moderate pace of play, such as 59-odd hands per hour, but others can push this number to over 100. Another thing we love about Americas Cardroom is how easy it is to navigate the menus.</p>
<p>You can filter through the main type of game, i.e. No Limit, Fixed Limit, and Pot Limit and then choose from:</p>
<p>High</p>
<p>Medium</p>
<p>Low</p>
<p>Micro</p>
<p>Play Money</p>
<p>Jackpots and Hold’em events tend to be the most frequented games, although players are always keeping an eye out for Sit &amp; Go’s and Tournaments. Blitz Poker is a great option for anyone looking to quicken the pace of their game. The average hands per hour played here can range from 90 to over 230.</p>
<p>Jackpot Poker</p>
<p>Jackpot poker is a great way to build up your Americas Cardroom bankroll, although it will rely chiefly on some luck. This version of the game comes with three cards and buy-ins ranging from $2 to $50 with the potential to vie for a prize pot ranging from $5,000 to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>A regular Jackpot game is in a winner-takes-all, but if a multiplier appears, then you will have to divvy up the loot as follows:</p>
<p>1 st – 75% of the prize pool</p>
<p>– 75% of the prize pool 2 nd – 15% of the prize pool</p>
<p>– 15% of the prize pool 3rd – 10% of the prize pool</p>
<p>Your chances of triggering the $100,000 prize pool with a $40 buy-in per game are 1 in 100,000. Some players argue that the game relies too heavily on luck for the multipliers and they prefer to stick to the Texas Hold’em menu.</p>
<p>Blitz Poker</p>
<p>Some Americas Cardroom players have long been asking for a slightly quicker pace. In Blitz Poker, you will get to go through an average of 120-150 hands per hour without having to worry too much. Players who can analyze a table and a hand quicker will benefit from it.</p>
<p>A downside here is that there are fewer games, but on the other hand, Blitz Poker games are always full. The most popular stake levels are:</p>
<p>$0.05/$0.10</p>
<p>$0.25/$0.50</p>
<p>$1/$2</p>
<p>The Winning Poker Network has always been known for its fast-fold poker products, and Blitz is no exception. When the game debuted in 2019, there used to be some technical issues, because of the scalability of the offer, but this has been since resolved.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom Tournaments</p>
<p>In terms of tournaments, Americas Cardroom has plenty to offer. The more important events are always colored in red and pushed to the very top of the tourney menu. Daily, there are dozens of events, if not hundreds of viable poker tournaments to pick from. Some of the best ones offer anything from $500 GTD to $15,000 GTD. The buy-ins will usually reflect the prize pool of each event.</p>
<p>ACT Mobile Poker</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom does well on mobile devices. The instant play software is compatible with all handheld devices, including those running on iOS and Android. While there isn’t a dedicated Americas Cardroom app, you can still play on the go and enjoy a quality poker experience.</p>
<p>Either way, what you need to do first is set up your dedicated account. Once you have that, just load up ACR’s website on your handheld device, whether that’s a smartphone or a tablet and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Is ACR Legit?</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom is a legit operator as it has operated on the US poker market for close to two decades, since 2001. The card room has established itself as one of the most trusted and secure destinations where you can play online poker from the USA today. While the website doesn’t have a license, this hasn’t stopped players from concluding that ACR is the one-stop-shop for all online poker.</p>
<p>ACR bills itself as the largest poker site in the US, but we still believe that this title stays with Ignition Poker, at least in terms of pure poker traffic. The website is audited by CSR and iTech Labs for additional security and Americas Cardroom has a state-of-the-art SSL encryption technology in place to provide players with the safest poker plays available online.</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom: Customer Support and Live Chat</p>
<p>Should you need customer support, it’s great to know that you will always find it at Americas Cardroom. The website offers live chat support as well as email at [email protected]. There is a FAQ section where you will find additional information about the most frequently asked questions and even troubleshoot an issue or two yourself if you ever feel inclined to</p>
<p>Americas Cardroom: Reddit Review</p>
<p>ACR is clearly one of the most discussed poker sites in the US. There have been somewhat contrasted opinions if the website measures up to the standards of the community. Most players have agreed that the website has a strong tournament offer. That is the one point everyone agrees with.</p>
<p>According to Reddit, though, there are 10% of bots present in most of the website. ACR has recently announced another sweep designed to tackle automated accounts, but players haven’t reported anything yet. In terms of professional and recreational players, the ration is evenly matched with around 40% of each group.</p>
<p>Another thing player have discussed at length are the HUDs, allowing players to collect data on opponents and perhaps even hunt them from one game to the next. Not everyone agrees that HUDs are a downside.</p>
<p>Some Redditors have commented that online poker feels safer when you can put a name and an avatar to a person. ACR definitely holds a small lead against most other online poker sites in the US because of its tournament offer. It’s also ranked #2 in terms of traffic, second behind Ignition Poker.</p>
<p>Try Americas Cardroom Yourself</p>
<p>Overall, Americas Cardroom is a solid online poker site catering to both recreational and competitive poker players. The website has one of the best selection of tournaments and is the second-largest place where poker players go to play in the USA. When you consider this, ACR cuts a very respectable profile.</p>
