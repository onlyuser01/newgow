<p>Sports betting and online gaming affiliate company operating out of Sweden Leadstar Media announced it has been granted a license as a registered vendor by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC).</p>
<p>US Expansion Continues</p>
<p>Following the approval by the state regulator, Leadstar Media will be added to the list of approved vendors in Maryland within a week and will be authorized to operate in the state by promoting operators in the market ahead of the anticipated launch of sports betting in the Free State.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Leadstar Media chief executive officer Eskil Kvarnström outlined that, while the company has been growing in many markets around the world, achieving success in the US is a major goal for the business, and that involves reaching out to “as many users across the country as possible.”</p>
<p>“Being approved to operate in Maryland will help us provide even more Americans with premium iGaming experiences,” added Kvarnström.</p>
<p>As Maryland is expected to go live with online sports betting in the coming months and many operators are preparing to launch and have submitted applications, Leadstar Media will be able to leverage its expertise and provide Marylanders with in-depth reviews and exclusive offers on its SportsbooksOnline.com and UnitedGamblers.com websites.</p>
<p>Kvarnström continued by highlighting Leadstar Media’s efforts to “provide all players with a seamless betting experience” adamant that to achieve that goal, the business needs to expand its coverage to more states, alongside the product’s enhancements made in the past few years.</p>
<p>The decision of the MLGCC to authorize Leadstar Media for operations in Maryland added another US jurisdiction to the business following the recent launch of sports betting in Kansas, meaning that the Swedish-based affiliate company is now active in 17 US states.</p>
<p>The Importance of Early Start</p>
<p>“We’ve seen before that being available to users on Day 1 puts us in a great position to provide users with the best betting experience possible,” continued Kvarnström, pointing to the importance of early starts as it allows state residents to explore the company’s offering for the first time.</p>
<p>“Being approved well ahead of launch will allow us to give users the best answers to their questions,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC) finally approved the application process for mobile and Class B facility sports betting licenses, giving candidates 45 days to submit their applications.</p>
<p>Following the October 21 deadline day for application submissions, SWARC said it would need another 45 days to assess applicants, meaning that Maryland may be in line to officially launch at the beginning of 2023.</p>
