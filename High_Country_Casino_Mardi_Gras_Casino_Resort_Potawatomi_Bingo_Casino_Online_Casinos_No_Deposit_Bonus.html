<p>After four games, the 2022 NBA Finals series between the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors is tied 2-2. Their most recent game – played on Friday evening – saw the Warriors destroy the Celtics 107-97. The reason why “destroyed” is a suitable term is that the game was played at TD Garden in Boston where the hosts were -167 pre-game favorites.</p>
<p>The visitors from California got themselves a victory, tying the series 2-2. Now, in Game 5, they’re expected to take a lead. The reason? The NBA Finals are moving back to West Coast. Chase Center in San Francisco is the place where the Warriors are going to welcome the Celtics on Monday evening.</p>

<p>Winning at Home is a Must for the Warriors</p>
<p>So far, the 2022 NBA Finals have been very hard to predict. In the first game of the series, the Warriors were expected to win but they ended up losing their first home matchup since the start of the payoffs. In their most recent game, the Celtics were favored to win but the Warriors upset the bookies this time.</p>
<p>On Monday, the series moves back to California, and once again the home team is the favorite. Are we going to see the warriors fulfill bookmakers’ expectations this time?</p>
<p>It sure seems so, for several reasons. First of all, it seems that Steph Curry is okay. The injury he suffered in Game 3 obviously wasn’t too serious, even though it did look scary. The evidence that he’s 100% is that in the following game, he put away 43 points – his best offensive performance since the start of the NBA Playoffs.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Warriors are favored to win on Monday is that it’s a great opportunity to get a lead in the Finals. The game is played on their turf, while Game 6 is played in Boston three days later. Losing on Monday would mean big problems for the Warriors. In that case, they’d have to go to roaring TD Garden to try and beat the Celtics once again.</p>
<p>Monday’s Game Might be Crucial for the Celtics</p>
<p>If they beat the Warriors in California, they will take a 3-2 lead in the series, which then returns to TD Garden on Thursday. That said, winning on Monday would take Boston much closer to the NBA title.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s great motivation for the Celtics but the question is whether they have it in them to beat the Warriors in San Fran. Well, they already did it once in the 2022 NBA Finals. In the series opener, the Celtics won 120-108 despite being +140 underdogs before the game.</p>
<p>That was their fifth straight win over the Warriors on the road. The Californians ended Boston’s run in the following game, but the fact is that this team tends to do well at Chase Center.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics vs Golden State Warriors Game 5 Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game, in which the winner will be decided by only a couple of points. So, which of the two will win it? The Warriors are favored for a reason, but we’re sure they’re going to have a much tougher job than what the betting odds are suggesting.</p>
<p>Picks: Warriors to win but not cover the spread; over to hit</p>
