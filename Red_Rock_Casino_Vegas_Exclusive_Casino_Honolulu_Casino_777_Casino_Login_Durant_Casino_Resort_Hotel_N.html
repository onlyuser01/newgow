<p>The integration will be a win-win for all stakeholders, representatives said</p>
<p>A week after publishing impressive Q2 results, NeoGames, a tech-driven provider of end-to-end solutions to the online gambling and online lottery industries, unveiled a new partnership agreement. As announced, NeoGames will work together with Scientific Games to deliver premium content to the Pennsylvania Lottery in the United States.</p>
<p>Under the deal, NeoGames will leverage proprietary games from its NeoGames Studio to power Scientific Games’ platform with content. For the next three years, this content will be supplied to the Pennsylvania Lottery, allowing it to engage customers with a selection of award-winning eInstant games.</p>
<p>NeoGames will gradually add new content to the PA Lottery throughout the coming year, providing Pennsylvanian lottery players with something to look forward to.</p>
<p>The partnership arrangement represents yet another expansion of NeoGames’ extensive footprint in the North American market. For reference, the supplier currently supplies eight North American lotteries with its cutting-edge iLottery offering.</p>
<p>NeoGames Studio is NeoGames’ in-house games studio, which boasts 17 years in the iLottery industry. The provider excels in eInstant games and has created over 250 titles since its inception. NeoGames Studio is also the recipient of multiple prestigious industry awards, including the Best New Game award at the EGR North America Awards 2023, which it won thanks to its new title, Desert Fantasy.</p>
<p>A Win-Win for All Stakeholders</p>
<p>Spokespeople expressed the parties’ excitement about the partnership. Drew Svitko, executive director at the Pennsylvania Lottery said that his team is glad by the opportunity to add innovative content from the prestigious NeoGames Studio to its product offering.</p>
<p>Svitko added that innovative content is something that the lottery values a lot, which is why it is looking forward to working with NeoGames.</p>
<p>We believe that this deal will enhance the Lottery’s appeal to online players, while fulfilling the PA Lottery’s mission of boosting proceeds to programs that benefit older residents. Drew Svitko, executive director, Pennsylvania Lottery</p>
<p>Hili Shakked, NeoGames Studio’s managing director, also commented on the new partnership with Scientific Games and the Pennsylvania Lottery, saying that it will allow his team to vastly expand the reach of its premium eInstants.</p>
<p>The collaboration is a further illustration of our commitment to providing innovative, engaging games that meet the needs of lottery customers. We are confident that this long-term agreement will be a win-win for all stakeholders. Hili Shakked, managing director, NeoGames Studio</p>
<p>In other news, NeoGames recently broadened its European footprint as well, signing a four-year deal with the Lotteries Entertainment Innovation Alliance.</p>
