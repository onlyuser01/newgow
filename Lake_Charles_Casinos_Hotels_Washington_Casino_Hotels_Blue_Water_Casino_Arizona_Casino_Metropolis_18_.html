<p>Wild Toro review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Toro is based around the world of bullfighting. It sidesteps the less savoury aspects of the sport, by rendering the whole thing as a Tom and Jerry style contest between a cartoon bull and a rakish matador.</p>
<p>The other symbols lean into this with old style Spanish coins, ladies fans, and roses.</p>
<p>The tone of the tale (or tail) is charming and upbeat and combines well with the clever gameplay gimmicks that are built in.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>With its cartoon symbols rendered beautifully and its highly mobile animated win, spin, and walking Wild sequences, Wild Toro is a lovely slot to look at. The symbols are rendered with plenty of character and the style stands out against other, similar themed slots.</p>
<p>The music track is limited to wins, and the range of sound effects is a bit generic for a slot that is otherwise rich in character. There are ambient crowd noises which lend the game some atmosphere, but the win and spin sounds could be from any slot of any kind.</p>
<p>Overall, though, this slot is an example of excellent design.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Toro is a five reel slot with four rows.</p>
<p>The game uses an unusual "connecting ways" system to determine winning combinations. This means that combinations must start in reel one and move to adjacent reels. Unlike an "any way" winning system the symbols in a winning combo must be adjacent or touch diagonally. On a five by four slot this makes for 178 win ways.</p>
<p>There is a bonus game, but no gamble feature.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Toro and Matador symbols.</p>
<p>The Toro symbol is a special Wild. On a typical spin it works like any other Wild. However, if there is also a Matador symbol on the reel, the Matador will trigger a free respin. After every respin the Toro will move one space, leaving a Wild Symbol each time.</p>
<p>When the Toro lands on a Matador, the Matador is removed from the reels. When there are no more Matadors, the respins end and the player is paid.</p>
<p>The rules for Toro’s movements are always one space towards any Matador on its reel. If there is no Matador on its reel, it will either move left or right one space. If it has not been to reel five, it will then opt for one space to the right. If it is on reel five or has been to reel five at some point, then it moves one space to the left.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.3%, this is a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>High volatility and a moderately high RTP make this slot appealing as a strategic choice.</p>
<p>The slot also gains points for having a lot of personality and atmosphere. The theme is cleverly executed and works at every stage from the visuals to the bonus games.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this slot.</p>
