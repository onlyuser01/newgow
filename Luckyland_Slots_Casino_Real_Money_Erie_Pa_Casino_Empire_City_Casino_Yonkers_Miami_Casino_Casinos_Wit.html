<p>Information about Indian casinos</p>
<p>When looking for an online casino that accepts players from India, it's important to bear some things in mind. It should have a good selection of games and great customer care, but most importantly, it should be safe and reliable.</p>
<p>This page will help you find the India-friendly casinos that meet these demands. You can also read up on gambling laws in India, as well as information about bonuses for Indian players.</p>
<p>Table of contents:</p>
<p>India's land-based gambling laws</p>
<p>Gambling laws in India are complex and vary from state to state. Despite there being a national Gambling Act (1867) that prohibits running (and visiting) a public gambling house, the Indian Constitution, formed in 1949, gives states the power to create their own gambling laws in its Seventh Schedule (34, List II), which the government cannot interfere in.</p>
<p>To date, only three states allow land-based casinos: Goa, Daman and Sikkim, however, even these are subject to restrictions. The states released a combined Public Gambling Act in 1976 which dictates that only five-star hotels and offshore vessels can house a casino, and only with the regional government's permission. It means there are still relatively few casinos to choose from, with tourist-friendly Goa hosting ten — including a few 'floating casinos' — and Sikkim and Daman only a handful between them.</p>
<p>The law varies across the country's other 25 states. Nagaland and Maharashtra are two states that have passed acts banning gambling, while others discourage the practice but have certain grey areas. These are too numerous to mention in this article, so, like with all law-related issues, it's always a good idea for players to read up on their local state laws before taking part in any gambling activity.</p>
<p>Note: Like in many countries that have strict anti-gambling laws, a betting black market has thrived for many years in sports betting and illegal casinos. Its obvious lack of regulation means that much of the money finds its way in the hands of criminals, which has led to many people calling for the national legalization of gambling in India. Whether this will happen is doubtful, but the argument for a regulated system is a strong one.</p>
<p>Online gambling laws in India</p>
<p>Online gambling is a relatively recent phenomenon in India, so most national and state laws don't mention it as an activity. Even the national Information Technology Act of 2000, designed to regulate cyber activities, does not mention virtual gambling, and therefore is open to interpretation.</p>
<p>That said, many states do actively outlaw the practice, and anyone caught breaking the law may face severe punishment. For that reason, like with land-based betting, it's recommendable to always check the local law regarding online gambling before playing.</p>
<p>Despite this, some states have tried to liberalize their online gambling laws. They have a legal online lottery and tried (but failed) to offer several online gambling licences in 2010. This suggests that there could be an online gambling market for domestic operators in certain places in the future.</p>
<p>While gambling on domestic sites is pretty much forbidden across the country, it's important to stress that visiting offshore, or non-Indian, sites is legal for Indian players. Indian law does not specifically ban those, meaning players won't face punishment, although this could change in the future.</p>
<p>If you're a player based in India looking for an online casino to play in, then the next section will show you how to choose the right one.</p>
<p>How to choose the best India online casino</p>
<p>There are many online casinos on Casino Guru's database that accept players in India, but it's useful to know how to choose one that will give you the best iGaming experience possible, one that you can rely on to pay out winnings and solve issues that you might have.</p>
<p>To help you with this, our team of experts have compiled a review and rating for each casino to help you make your choice. The criteria are strict, but it will help you to find the gems and weed out the sites that you don't want. You can find out how our team do this in our How we review online casinos article.</p>
<p>This page also includes several filters that you can employ to get the options you want. Selecting the 'Recommended' tab will show you the highest-scoring India casinos, according to our team: these will give you the best chance of a great playing experience. The 'Newly opened' tab will show you the newest options on our database, while the 'All' option will simply give you the full list.</p>
<p>You can also use other filters to narrow your options down further. If it's casinos that accept the Indian Rupee (INR) that you're looking for, then you can choose 'INR' in the Currency filter to see sites who do this. Mobile casinos for Indian players might also be useful for you, and you can find those by selecting the filter above or going to our list of mobile-friendly casinos.</p>
<p>Note: There are other filters that can help you decide. Many players seek their preferred payment method in a casino, for example, and you can do this by choosing your preferred one in the 'Payment Method' section. Two popular providers in India are Amex and PayPal, and both can be found in this section.</p>
<p>Casino Guru's How to choose an online casino article gives you a detailed look at everything on the topic of selecting the right site, so feel free to read up on this to make a good, informed decision.</p>
<p>How to find online casino bonuses available to India players</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses can be one of the great perks of the iGaming world, if used in the correct way. They give you the chance to work out whether you like a new casino and to try out its games. Deposit (or welcome) bonuses are probably the most common, but many casinos offer no deposit bonuses, too.</p>
<p>Many India-friendly casinos offer these bonuses, and Casino Guru can help you find the best ones. For the full selection of them, head to our list of casino bonuses and choose 'India' in the 'For players from' filter.</p>
<p>To sort them by type, choose the variety you'd like in the 'Bonus Type' section, so for no deposit bonuses, simply click the 'No Deposit Bonus' option. Alternatively, you can go to our list of no deposit bonuses and select 'India' there.</p>
<p>You'll always get the most relevant options due to our team's hard work in keeping them up to date.</p>
