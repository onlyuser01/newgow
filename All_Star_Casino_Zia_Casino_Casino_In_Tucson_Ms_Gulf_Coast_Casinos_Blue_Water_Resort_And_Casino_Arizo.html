<p>A new bill has been proposed in Connecticut aiming to ban greyhound racing altogether and also prohibit any live broadcast of greyhound races taking place outside of the state</p>
<p>Bill 5042 was proposed by 105th district representative Nicole Klarides-Ditria, 91st district representative Michael D’Agostino, and 18th district senator Heather Somers.</p>
<p>Bill 5042 Is Not the First Attempt to Ban Greyhound Racing in Connecticut</p>
<p>Bill 5042 proposes a full prohibition on the operation of any greyhound racing tracks in the state of Connecticut. Furthermore, it introduces a ban on any simulcasting of greyhound racing events that are taking place outside of the state.</p>
<p>However, this is not the first time such legislative changes have been proposed. A similar bill was approved by the Senate in 2017 but it did not go through the House of Representatives so it was eventually scrapped.</p>
<p>In 2021, there was another attempt to ban greyhound racing in the state but the House of Representatives voted against the bill proposal. Then, in February 2022, Republican State Representative Nicole Klarides-Ditria proposed a very similar bill with number 5174 but it never really go through the whole approval process.</p>
<p>Greyhound Racing Is Deemed Inhumane and Cruel</p>
<p>The difference between the bill from February and the current bill proposal is that the previous one only introduced a ban on the operation of greyhound tracks but did not present any rules around simulcasting. The latest bill wants to eradicate not only greyhound racing tracks in the state but also thwart any live broadcast of such races in connection with sports betting activities. This will probably mean that the legislative changes will have an effect on sports wagering on greyhound races altogether with most operators eventually choosing not to offer such wagers.</p>
<p>Both the bill from February and the current bill, however, point to the fact that 41 other US states have already made greyhound racing illegal. The two bill proposals also highlight that the dogs participating in such races are often treated in inhumane ways and are subject to abuse and injuries. The use of live bait is also underlined as cruel.</p>
<p>Greyhound Racing Has Been Declining for a Long Time</p>
<p>There are no greyhound race tracks left in Connecticut. This form of entertainment was very popular in the past with Connecticut’s first track – Plainfield Greyhound Park – opening in 1976. However, by 2005 all live greyhound races had been discontinued as attendance was very low and its glory days were practically over.</p>
<p>Yet, according to legislation, opening a greyhound race track is still possible in Connecticut. With the latest bill proposal 5042, lawmakers are trying to reflect these historical developments and make it impossible for this cruel form of entertainment to have a comeback in Connecticut.</p>
