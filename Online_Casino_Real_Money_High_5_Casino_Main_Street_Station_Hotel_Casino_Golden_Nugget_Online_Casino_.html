<p>The Giants are a Step Away from the Playoffs</p>
<p>The Giants’ chance of making the playoffs is close to 90%. If things don’t go horribly wrong for them, they’re going to make the postseason for the first time since 2016.</p>
<p>As they’re playing in NFC East – which is one of the toughest divisions in the league – their only chance to get to the playoffs is via Wild Card.</p>
<p>To book a Wild Card berth, they might only need one more win. That certainly sounds good, but the problem is that their schedule in the remainder of the regular season looks very hard. After the game with the in-form Vikings, they’re taking on the Indianapolis Colts, while in the final gameweek, their opponent is the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Confidence is High at U.S. Bank Stadium</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the Minnesota Vikings pulled off the biggest comeback in the history of the NFL. After going 36-0 down to the Indianapolis Colts in the first half, they went on to equalize the game and get themselves a 39-36 win in overtime.</p>

<p>The comeback has certainly given their players a major confidence boost, while also making their fans dream bigger dreams than before. The Vikings are 11-3 and they’re certainly going to make the playoffs this season, but how far can they go? Their fans now think they could go all the way to the end.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, the Vikes are sitting in the no.7 position on the list of Super Bowl favorites, with odds of +2000. Those odds are going to shorten if Minnesota continues to impress. This goes especially if KOC’s boys finish the regular season as the no.1 seed in the East. They’re two wins behind the Philadelphia Eagles, but the race still isn’t over.</p>
<p>Giants vs Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>The team from Minneapolis won each of the previous three Giants vs Vikings duels. Two of those took place at U.S. Bank Stadium, which is where the Vikes have been sensational in 2022. At home, they’re 7-1 and we don’t think the Giants can tarnish their record.</p>
<p>Picks: Minnesota Vikings to win and cover the spread</p>
