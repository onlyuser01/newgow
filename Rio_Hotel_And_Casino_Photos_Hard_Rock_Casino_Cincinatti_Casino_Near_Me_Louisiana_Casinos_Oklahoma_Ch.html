<p>Big Bass Bonanza review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a sunny fishing trip.</p>
<p>Players will head out on crystal blue water to try their luck at snagging the biggest fish in the river. The reels are well stocked with a fishing tackle box, floats, and fish small to huge.</p>
<p>Immersed in the watery world, players will lose themselves in the holiday vibe. The colourfully-hued fish swim tantalisingly within reach, and players will have fun reeling them in.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music is cheerful and matches the bright setting. However, the loop turnaround is quite quick and players who are not in the mood will probably hit mute.</p>
<p>The reels spin to a bubbling sound, and a chirping chime rings in wins. This reinforces the feeling that the reels are spinning through the water.</p>
<p>The Big Bass symbol is the most iconic with his tail flipping through a sunset scene. His mouth is inches away from snapping up a fish hook. He seems well worth the namesake of the game.</p>
<p>The other symbols are all colourful and eye-catching, but the differences in their graphic art styles is notable, as if they were created by different artists. For example, the fish animations have cartoon-ish bodies and friendly anthropomorphic expressions, while the dragonfly symbol is drawn with a realistic level of detail that might be found in a science textbook.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the azure blue water of the backdrop ties the images together and provides a calm engrossing setting for the reels. The surface of the water shimmers in the sunlight, and it’s easy to imagine the cool sensation on a warm summer day.</p>
<p>The Money Collect win in the Big Bass Bonanza slot machine</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Big Bass Bonanza is a five reel, three row slot, with 10 win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is especially smooth, as if the reels are freshly oiled. This makes for a satisfying pace and an engrossing experience.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>The Money symbol is given a randomised value for every spin. Fish symbols also serve as Money symbols when they are part of a winning combination.</p>
<p>Whenever players land 3 or more Scatter symbols, the Free Spins feature begins. Greater numbers of Scatter symbols produce higher numbers of free spins, as follows:</p>
<p>3 Scatters: 10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Scatters: 15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Scatters: 20 free spins</p>
<p>Each Wild symbol gathers all the values of any Money symbols on the screen while in the Free Spins feature. Players collect all the Wild symbols that landed at the end of the feature.</p>
<p>Every fourth Wild symbol that players collect will retrigger the Free Spins feature, up to three times.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.71%, substantially higher than our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€250 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is on the high end of medium, which makes it an okay match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high-medium volatility fishing themed slot.</p>
<p>The colourful animation and playful mood combine with a decent mathematical profile to make a game well worth visiting.</p>
<p>The entertaining bonus options will be a familiar find for most players and the engaging pace of the gameplay will keep the watery adventure going.</p>
