<p>New York Stock Exchange-listed Genius Sports Limited has invited UK’s former ministry for sport Sir Hugh Robertson to join its newly formed business advisory council. The decision will go into effect without further delay. The former Conservative MP’s main responsibility will be to identify fresh strategic development opportunities for the company. He will also be busy reinforcing the company’s mission to turn into the most reputable sports technology and data partner on the planet.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh Robertson Was Knighted for His Work During the 2012 Summer Olympics</p>
<p>Before agreeing to his position in the ministry for sport, he spent a decade in the Household Cavalry and also worked with Schroders prior to becoming the MP for Faversham and Mid Kent in 2001. In 2012, he was appointed as a Privy Counselor. After spending almost three and a half years as David Cameron’s minister for sport from May 2010 to October 2013, Sir Hugh Robertson was named the minister of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Robertson’s remarkable contribution and work during the London Summer Olympics in 2012 brought him a knighthood from the Queen in 2014. His impressive work as a minister of state was also one of the reasons why he received the prestigious knight order from the Queen herself.</p>
<p>The company’s new advisor left UK’s political scene in 2015. Ever since, he has worked for Falcon Associates and he has been running UK’s national lottery operator Camelot since 2018. He is also chair of the British Olympic Association since 2016.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh Robertson is expected to bring his wealth of know-how and experience as a former minister for sports to Genius’ new business advisory team. Sir Robertson expressed his delight regarding his new role at Genius Sports while saying he was eager to begin working with the management team to create a company “at the forefront of sports data and technology.” He also stated that the analysis and commercialization of live sports data is an essential driver for growth in the media, broadcast, and regulated betting markets. Sir Robertson is also confident that his independence, experience on a global scale, and expertise in the commercial field should help Genius Sports fully capitalize on the advantage.</p>
<p>Genius Sports Will Grow Its Global Standing With its Decision</p>
<p>The company’s chief executive office Mark Locke expressed his thrill regarding the new appointment while acknowledging his two-decade-old efforts invested in supporting sports in the UK. He added Sir Robertson will also use his rich stakeholder and commercial expertise in driving the expansion of the company in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Genius Sports’ technology is currently available in more than 150 countries all over the globe. The company also counts more than 400 partnerships with prestigious sports organizations and huge sports federations and leagues including the National Football League, the English Premier League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. The company’s Q1 data for 2022 presented strong revenue growth. At the beginning of May, Genius Sports agreed to offer its services to Brazilian online sportsbook Betsul.</p>
