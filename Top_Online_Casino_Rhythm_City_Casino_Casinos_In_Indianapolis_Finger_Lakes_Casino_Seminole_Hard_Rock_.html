<p>The Multi-Year Partnership between theScore and Twin River</p>
<p>Yesterday, August 27, theScore and Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc signed a multi-year agreement. Under the partnership, theScore has secured market access to operate an online casino in New Jersey. The company plans to launch its casino product in the state in the second half of 2021. The launch is subject to securing the necessary licensing from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Furthermore, the roll-out is also depending on the completion of Twin River’s acquisition of Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The recently inked agreement will see Twin River receive a percentage of the revenue raised from theScore’s online casino in the Garden State. theScore will be subject to annual minimum guaranteed amounts, an upfront fee and, maybe renewal fees but further details are yet to be revealed. The current agreement spans for 10 years but can be extended by a five-year renewal term at theScore’s option. Additional five-year renewal term is valid upon mutual agreement of the involved parties.</p>
