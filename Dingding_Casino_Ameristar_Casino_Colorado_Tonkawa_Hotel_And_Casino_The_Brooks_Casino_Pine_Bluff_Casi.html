<p>Global payments technology company Nuvei Corporation announced a new partnership with the leading casino, poker and online sports betting operator, Lottomatica. The collaboration was announced Thursday this week. Under the terms of the new deal, Nuvei was named an exclusive supplier of payment technology for Lottomatica.</p>
<p>Leveraging Nuvei's payment technology, Lottomatica will now offer its clients market-leading payment methods available for both withdrawals and deposits. The new methods are expected to elevate the customers' experience while at the same time boosting the acceptance rates for cards and minimizing transaction costs.</p>
<p>In a statement released on October 13, 2022, Nuvei explained: "In addition to card payments, Lottomatica players can complete transactions using all the most relevant alternative payment methods players' demand." According to the leading payment operator, a single integration is needed to make the payment methods available.</p>
<p>Philip Fayer, Nuvei's Chair and CEO, acknowledged that Lottomatica is a leading online gambling brand that has a presence in the regulated gambling market in Italy. He added: "We're pleased to be offering a complete payments solution to support the growth of another leading European iGaming operator."</p>
<p>According to Fayer, the company continues to grow its presence and offer payment services for iGaming operators in Europe and around the world. In conclusion, Nuvei's Chair and CEO outlined: "Our fully customizable technology, dedication to superior customer service, and deep knowledge of regulated markets set us apart from the rest of the industry."</p>
<p>As a leading payment services provider, Nuvei currently offers a highly-flexible and scalable technology. Besides payment options, the company's partners can benefit from additional services such as banking, issuing cards and even risk and fraud management. Currently, the company offers services in more than 200 markets around the globe. It supports more than 570 alternative payment methods and 150 currencies.</p>
<p>Only recently, Nuvei announced a new partnership with Kindred. Last month, the company joined forces with the leading gambling operator and agreed to supply its payment services. At the time the deal was announced, Kindred revealed that it plans to leverage Nuvei's payment services to boost its growth across Europe.</p>
<p>Focusing on Nuvei's most recent collaboration, Lottomatica's Managing Director Betting and Digital Italy, Alessandro Fiumara, commented: "We're thrilled to be partnering with Nuvei to provide our players with the payments experience we know they demand." He acknowledged that offering flexible payments in combination with quality products is incredibly important for iGaming operators. Last but not least, Fiumara predicted that the new deal will help increase revenue and onboard new players while retaining existing players.</p>
