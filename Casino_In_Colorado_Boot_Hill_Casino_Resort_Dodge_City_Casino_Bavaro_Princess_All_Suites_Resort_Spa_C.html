    <h1>Casino In Colorado Boot Hill Casino Resort Dodge City Casino Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Spa C</h1>

<p>Skolâ€™s promotional team approached me via email, saying i could quote "double up my deposit" (have both physical and technical evidence to strengthen this claim) and i repeatedly asked online chat support (also can provide transcripts) where employees told me that bonus money will be available for withdrawal after wagering amount was met. Considering this, I think it would be fair to pay out my winnings on your website (2000EUR) since Skol employees made false claims about advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Skol decision about confiscating money without any warnings prior (when I made 1st and 2nd deposits and lost deposited money there was no issue there for some reason) is both unfair and against your own and licensing bodies principles.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if i can receive follow-up email as soon as possible, considering the fact that i really dont want to lose the money i won fairly (2000 EUR) over 50 euro bonus money i recieved.</p>

Considering this, I think it would be fair to pay out my winnings on your website (2000EUR) since your employees made false claims about advertising opportunities, which falls under the "False advertisement" clause and is against guidelines of both MGA and UKGC. If we can settle this disagreement (which is bullshit we both know that, i've had dealings with many casinos before and currently work for 6 of them tbh), i will file both formal and informal case complaints in both licensing bodys of White Hat Gaming LTD (MGA and UKGC).</p>
