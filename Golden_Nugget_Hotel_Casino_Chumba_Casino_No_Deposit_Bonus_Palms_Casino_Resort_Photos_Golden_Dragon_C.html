<p>Stats Perform, the sports technology pioneer in data and AI, announced the launch of PressBox, an all-in-one online platform that delivers data-driven insights, video clip discovery, and unprecedented data research at a rate never seen before.</p>
<p>Stats Perform to Launch PressBox</p>
<p>Producing high-quality analysis, graphics, video, and more in real-time during a live event is a near-impossible task for sports media organizations. PressBox solves these problems by bringing together the most useful resources in one location, all driven by Stats Perform’s best-in-class sports data.</p>
<p>With PressBox, users can supercharge development efforts, reduce time to insight, and improve commentary to create a truly unique fan experience.</p>
<p>Nancy Hensley, chief product and marketing officer at Stats Perform said that “Key narratives which might have taken researchers 10 crucial minutes to uncover are served in mere moments to PressBox users”</p>
<p>Hensley further stated that PressBox is the place to go for the most up-to-date sports research and data-driven perspectives, all in one easy-to-use platform.</p>
<p>In early February Stats Perform provided Leverkusen with Edge Analysis, a sophisticated match preparation tool that utilizes unique AI models powered by tracking and event data to provide predictive insights with regards to pre-and post-match analysis, as well as deliver objective performance evaluation on all opponents.</p>
<p>Stat Performs New Innovative Apps</p>
<p>PressBox Live and PressBox Video are two new Stats Perform applications that have been released alongside the PressBox platform.</p>
<p>PressBox Live, a real-time dashboard for sports media, offers a thorough accounting of players, squad data, feedback, and new AI indicators for more in-depth sport.</p>
<p>The dashboard has many things to offer such as advanced metrics like live win likelihood and predicted goals that change dynamically with the play, a live feed that surfaces information as soon as the action happens, easily unlocking the story of the game, and minimizing manual analysis time.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are graphics and visualizations that share knowledge that is easy to ingest, rather than only displaying conventional data tables, and integrated live chat with Stats Perform’s award-winning Research and Editorial staff to act as an extension of a user’s team.</p>
<p>PressBox Video has a large variety of sports clips, including over ten years of archive videos, as well as in-app, cloud-based video editing tools to expedite distribution and customize video content.</p>
<p>Using intuitive search functionality, consumers still find the right clip at the right time.</p>
<p>Multiple video file formats and screen ratios allow for video export compatible with most major broadcast devices and social media channels, as well as personalized content preferences that automatically display the most appropriate clips.</p>
<p>The PressBox interface combines PressBox Live and PressBox Video with Stats Perform’s other data and AI-driven software, giving broadcast and media teams all the resources they need to break unique stories quicker.</p>
<p>The PressBox app puts all of the critical resources for accessing rich data, video, and content-driven by industry-leading AI and forecasts at users’ fingertips with a single sign-on.</p>
<p>Production teams will increase their output, allowing for large-scale content development and faster distribution of broader, better stories to fans.</p>
<p>PressBox is a platform for increasing fan participation, sharing innovative stories, increasing subscriptions, and increasing ad sales.</p>
