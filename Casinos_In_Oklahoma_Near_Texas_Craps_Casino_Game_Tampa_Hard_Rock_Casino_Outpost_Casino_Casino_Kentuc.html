<p>Wild Hike, the “Perfect Game for These Cold Winter Nights”</p>
<p>The studio’s director of casino products Shelley Hannah called the new slot “the perfect game for these cold winter nights,” inviting players to relax and be carried into the very heart of the forest while enjoying a captivating journey at midnight. Hannah also believes the new game is prone to “hit the right notes and maintain a high level of excitement” among players.</p>
<p>The action is set at night time and players are invited to sit around the campfire and listen to the soothing crackles while being joined by mesmerizing wild animals like deer, bears, wolves, and owls in a well-secluded spot.</p>
<p>Matching six of the cards valued from 10 to A triggers a payout of 1x the stake whereas hitting six wild animal symbols brings players a payout of up to 1.8-10x the bet.</p>
<p>The howling wolf symbols are the wilds in the game. Their purpose is to replace the rest of the regular paying symbols represented by the wild animals and they are located on the four reels in the middle.</p>
<p>To admire the sky full of stars, gamers need to trigger the free spins round. This causes the camera to automatically pan upwards, right above the majestic treetops.</p>
<p>Free Spins, Expanding Wilds &amp; Bonus Buy Features</p>
<p>Coming across three scatter symbols brings players seven free spins, whereas landing four scatters triggers ten free spins for players eager to join Mother Nature. While engaged in the free spins round, multipliers are generated by the Expanding Wilds/Re-spins feature and they remain saved until the end of the round. The value of each of the multipliers can be seen above reels three and four when there are no Expanding Wilds in sight.</p>
<p>Every new scatter symbol that lands during this bonus round brings one additional free spin. When the free spins are activated during a Re-spin round, all multipliers obtained from the Re-spins are transferred in the free spins round.</p>
<p>All acquired multipliers on expanded wilds boost their value with each new win, sending players closer to a max win capped at 20,000x. Leading two expanded wild symbols at the same time means seeing them multiply each other for a massive win potential.</p>
<p>The buy feature allows players to enjoy seven or 10 free spins in exchange for 75x the bet. It is also possible to buy wild free spins and receive seven or 10 free spins along with a guaranteed win on double expanding wilds in exchange for 150x the bet.</p>
<p>At the start of February, Relax Gaming announced a partnership with AboutSlots.com, agreeing to co-produce a fresh player-led slot game. In January, SmartSoft Gaming joined the provider’s Powered by Relax aggregation platform.</p>
