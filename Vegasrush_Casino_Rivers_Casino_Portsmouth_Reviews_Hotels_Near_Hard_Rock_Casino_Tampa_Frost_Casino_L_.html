<p>The IBIA welcomed the B2B company to the team and praised its desire to protect the betting sector from corruption</p>
<p>Metric Gaming, a provider of sports betting tech, announced that it has joined the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). The move highlights the company’s commitment to protecting the betting sector from fraud.</p>
<p>Metric Gaming is a UK-based company licensed in Malta and the United Kingdom, as well as in a number of US states, including Colorado, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. As a body with international reach, Metric Gaming will be a valuable addition to the list of IBIA members.</p>
<p>As a member of the IBIA, Metric Gaming will join a lineup of more than 50 companies and over 125 sports betting brands. IBIA members collectively earn $137 billion in annual turnover, attesting to the size and capabilities of the organization.</p>
<p>The IBIA is comprised of some of the biggest operators in the betting sector and is a monitoring body that seeks to identify and crack down on fraudulent activities in sports betting. The body represents the licensed betting industry and leverages collective action to mitigate the damages caused by corruption in sports and wagering.</p>
<p>The IBIA uses a state-of-the-art monitoring and alert network to detect and report suspicious activities to relevant regulators. The association is further supported by many major sports and gambling organizations and authorities, boosting its efficiency in cracking down on harm.</p>
<p>Speaking of the IBIA, the organization recently published its Q2 2023 integrity report.</p>
<p>The IBIA Is Happy to Welcome Metric Gaming on Board</p>
<p>Metric Gaming’s chief operations officer, Dan Banham, said that his team is proud to join forces with the IBIA and join the war on sports betting fraud. He expressed Metric’s desire to shield the sports and betting sectors and their customers from gambling-related corruption.</p>
<p>By joining the association, alongside other business leaders we look forward to contributing to the important work the IBIA do, a mission we see as essential to safeguard the continued growth of our industry. Dan Banham, COO, Metric Gaming</p>
<p>IBIA’s chief executive officer, Khalid Ali, also commented on the matter. He welcomed Metric Gaming to the growing roster of B2B and B2C IBIA members, praising it for its “clear desire” to enhance its products with integrity protection.</p>
<p>The company’s [Metric Gaming’s] array of licenses and operational capacity will further strengthen our world-leading integrity monitoring network. Metric Gaming’s decision to join IBIA demonstrates its clear desire to utilize the best integrity protection available globally for its sports betting product. Khalid Ali, CEO, IBIA</p>
<p>Last month, the IBIA was also joined by OlyBet, a leading betting brand with significant experience from the Baltic region.</p>
