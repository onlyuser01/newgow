<p>The operator said it is bringing a new restaurant row to the venue, and that its currently shuttered buffet space will soon be occupied by new gaming amenities. Across the country, many gaming companies ditched buffets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, discovering new, more profitable uses for those spaces. That could prove to be the case at Green Valley Ranch.</p>
<p>The premier Henderson resort destination is set to add two exciting new dining offerings by renowned chefs, Eric and Bruce Bromberg of Bromberg Bros. Blue Ribbon Restaurants,” according to a post on Station Casinos’ STN Blog.</p>
<p>Red Rock is the parent company of Station Casinos. Including Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock operates several venues in Henderson, which is one of the largest Las Vegas suburbs.</p>
<p>Green Valley Ranch Update Plans</p>
<p>Already one of the dominant operators of gaming venues catering to locals in the Las Vegas Valley, Red Rock’s efforts to spruce up Green Valley Ranch are part of broader plans to cement the company’s foothold in the Las Vegas locals segment.</p>
<p>Those include the recent debut of a Wildfire casino in downtown Las Vegas, and the opening of Durango later this year in the Southwest area of the city. Some analysts expect by the start of the next decade, Red Rock will have doubled its number of Las Vegas venues, potentially creating a 70% jolt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the process.</p>
<p>As for dining options at Green Valley Ranch, the venue will be getting a new Mediterranean concept and sushi bar.</p>
<p>“Adding to the resort’s dining portfolio early next year, Green Valley Ranch will become home to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar &amp; Grill as it expands to Henderson with a 136-seat restaurant featuring pristine sushi,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>There’s a Blue Ribbon Sushi location in Red Rock in Summerlin. Green Valley Ranch’s Backyard pool deck will also be enhanced as part of the venue’s broader renovations.</p>
<p>Green Valley Ranch Making Play for More VIPs</p>
<p>In terms of newly minted gaming fare at Green Valley Ranch’s casino, those plans call for a revamped VIP slots room and an improved high-limit room with table games.</p>
<p>“Green Valley Ranch will soon debut a stunning and sophisticated high limit table games room featuring ten games including single zero roulette, double deck blackjack, six deck S17 shoe and midi baccarat for high stakes wagering with high touch service and dedicated casino cage,” according to the blog post. “The luxe bar will offer ten bartop games alongside an elevated classic cocktail menu. The space will provide three additional gaming areas with select games offering an intimate setting.”</p>
<p>The new high-limit slot will room will feature about 125 machines and 14 bartop devices.</p>
