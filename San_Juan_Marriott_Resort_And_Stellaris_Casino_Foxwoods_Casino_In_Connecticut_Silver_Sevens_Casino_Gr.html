    <h1>San Juan Marriott Resort And Stellaris Casino Foxwoods Casino In Connecticut Silver Sevens Casino Gr</h1>

<p>Hi Roobet &amp; Jozef,</p>
<p>just to be clear here with this case at no point ever has Roobet submitted any evidence or there claims they have made regarding to a VPN.</p>
<p>I on the other hand have proved every step of the way everything I have stated and never once have Roobet addressed any of the issues listed above.</p>
<p>in regards to the case with the license provider Roobet again claimed I had used a VPN to bypass there system but hadn’t submitted any evidence to back up there claims which essentially lead to a misinterpretation of actual facts regarding my account. Since the initial complaint as stated above I have been in contact with an IT consultant to attain evidence in regards to the IP addresses and Roobet s claims that I had used a VPN which again if you scroll above you can see this is backed up with factual findings.</p>
<p>if we can’t come to a resolution here I will be forced to present the new evidence and information to the licensing body to re assess the case as it’s clear Roobet had falsely stated the facts in regards to my account.</p>
<p>I hope that I can have your support jozef with this as you’ll be able to see from your correspondence with them that they don’t wish to engage with myself and have been truly unfair to myself in regards to this matter with constantly false claims and negligence.</p>
<p>I was hoping for closure with this complaint but by Roobets latest comment it’s clear we’re a far way off that as they’re still yet to take responsibility.</p>
<p>They still consistently claim that players from the UK are blocked and because of that I wouldn’t be able to access there website but that statement is simply untrue which you’ll be able to see for yourself if you look at the opened complaints on casino guru alone you’ll see there was a case where a uk player like myself was able to open an account to which Roobet agreed and refunded the money as the amount was only small in comparison to what they would need to refund in my case.</p>
<p>Again I must re iterate i have proved time and time again my innocence with regards to this matter as you can see from</p>
<p>all of the above thread.</p>
<p>if there’s anything else I can do to help with evidence please let me know Jozef.</p>
<p>Roobet I hope we can come to some sort of agreement regarding this case.</p>
<p>Furthermore just to reiterate It’s s Roobet themselves that provided the list of IP addresses that are supposedly assigned with my account and again I must reiterate they are all from restricted countries.</p>
<p>Roobet I ask you again please send myself and Jozef proof of your claims you’re yet to send any single piece of evidence.</p>
<p>the only evidence they have ever submitted even too the licensing body is this random list of restricted IP addresses which they’re still yet to answer where and how they have been aligned with my account.</p>
<p>I think it’s clear here there was some serious technical glitch with my account. As I stated this matter refers back to June which would explain why now there is a pop up in place where there wasn’t before.</p>
<p>Just to reiterate I want to work with you Roobet with the assistance of Jozef to come to a resolution in regards to this case that suits us all. I have already used many weeks and even invested my own money on trying to resolve this and I’m prepared to continue to do so if that’s what it takes, however as a ‘reputable casino’ I’m sure you would want to resolve this matter ASAP.</p>
<p>Jozef I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter with your extensive experience your views would be very much appreciated of how we may be able to solve this matter for both myself and Roobet.</p>
