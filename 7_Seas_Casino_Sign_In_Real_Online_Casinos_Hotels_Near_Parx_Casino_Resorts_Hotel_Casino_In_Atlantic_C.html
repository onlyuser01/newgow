<p>Torii Tumble review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Torii Tumble is a Japanese-themed online slot game that was designed and developed by Relax Gaming. Its main story focuses on a samurai passing through a Torii gate and facing off with a demon in another realm.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>A Torii, for those who don’t know, is the gate to a Shinto Shrine. It is said that when you pass through one of these gates, you pass from the mundane into the world of the sacred.</p>
<p>The Torii acts as the frame for the slot’s reels, with a mysterious, dimly lit land in the background. The reels are populated with several Japanese symbols and masks, with a samurai and some sort of demon making up two of the highest-paying symbols.</p>
<p>The slot does an excellent job of creating a mysterious and tense atmosphere. It feels like a far cry from some of Relax Gaming’s more cartoonish titles like Mega Heist or Fly Cats Dream Drop.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>One of the first things you will notice when you play Torii Tumble is that, on each spin, there are some positions on the reel locked off. The slot uses a 6x6 grid, and if all positions become active on a spin, the maximum number of ways to win is 46,656.</p>
<p>A random selection of symbols will appear on each spin. Winning combinations will trigger an Avalanche, with value-less blocks around winning symbols also being destroyed. New symbols will then fall onto the grid, and the process continues until there are no more winning combinations.</p>
<p>Everything you need to play the game is located under the reels, with the spin, autoplay, turbo option, and stake control all found here.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Torii Tumble slot has a selection of bonus features for players to enjoy. Firstly, there is a Multiplier Ladder that works with the Avalanche mechanic. The ladder is displayed above the reels, displaying x1,x2,x3,x4, and x5 multipliers. With each win in an Avalanche sequence, the ladder climbs one step. It resets whenever a sequence finishes.</p>
<p>There are also special symbols on the grid that can help this. The Multiplier Booster will increase the ladder values by either +1,+2, or +3. The Spin Saver acts as a life and will trigger another Avalanche to keep your sequences alive when you run out of winning combos. If you can clear all the blocked symbols on the grid, then the Multiplier Ladder values double.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the game is the Free Spins mode. This is triggered when you land three or more Scatter symbols. When triggered, players get to choose one of three options - Multiplier Mode, where special blocks add multiplier value and free spins, Spin Saver Mode, where the special blocks contain Spin Savers and free spins, or Mixed Mode, where this is a combination of both.</p>
<p>Players are given eight spins, with an extra spin for each additional Scatter. Blue Stones will land during the bonus, and these will reward up to three extra spins, as well as either the Multiplier boosts or the Spin Savers, depending on which mode you selected. At the start of the round, the Multiplier Ladder values are transferred to the free spins and doubled.</p>
<p>After the Free Spins are finished, a gamble feature is offered. This gives players the chance to buy extra free spins or gamble to win them for less. Multiplier Ladder upgrades are also maintained if you re-enter the bonus.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Buy Bonus option available depending on your location.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Torii Tumble offers players a maximum win of 20,000x your stake, which is a solid amount that will please most players. The slot has an RTP of 96.10%, which puts it slightly above the industry average, according to our slot strategy guide. The game is also considered highly volatile, which is another bonus.</p>
<p>The minimum you can bet in the game is $0.20, and the maximum is $100, which is a fairly standard betting range.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Torii Tumble starts out as quite a slow slot, but once you start hitting consecutive wins and unlock the Multiplier Ladder, its full potential becomes clear. The Free Spins round is where the big wins are waiting, and with a 20,000x maximum win, this is a game that has a lot of potential for payouts.</p>
