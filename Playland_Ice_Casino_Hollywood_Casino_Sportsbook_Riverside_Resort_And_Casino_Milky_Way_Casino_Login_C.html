    <h1>Playland Ice Casino Hollywood Casino Sportsbook Riverside Resort And Casino Milky Way Casino Login C</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>I am contacting you because I have had a problem self-excluding myself from Sultanbet casino, and I feel as though they have not acted appropriately in this case. I am hoping you can help me resolve this issue.</p>
<p>The trouble started when I first contacted the casino's live-chat support on June 18th 2022, asking my account to be closed permanently, clearly stating that I have a gambling problem. The chat agent told me that account closure must be done via e-mail support@sultanbet.com. I did that immediately after closing the chat. However, I encountered an issue as I got an automated response from Outlook saying that "the recipients mailbox is full and is unable to recieve messages". I went back to live-chat to address this issue.</p>
<p>Chat- agent told me that this should not be the case. He asked my personal information and reason why I wanted to close my account. Yet again, I stated that I have a gambling problem. Chat - agent told me that they need to have the official e-mail, in order for them to close my account and asked me to try again.</p>
<p>I sent multiple e-mails after this, and also one on the next day (June 19th, 2022), but got nothing back. I was still able to make deposits after this, until in july I stopped playing there for a while.</p>
<p>During the fall I recieved some messages from the casino on whatsapp about bonuses and offers. During this time I also asked them to close my account on whatsapp. At first, I was ensured that this would be done immediately, but yet again I recieved a message saying that account closure has to be done via e-mail. About a month back (don¨'t remember the exact time, as I don¨t unfortunately have these messages anymore) I also recieved Whatsapp message from Alex (I believe he said he is the casino's owner) and he said he was aware that I wanted my account self-excluded, but wanted to discuss with me via phone why I should keep my account open!</p>
<p>Unfortunately I relapsed on 10.12.2022, and proceeded to lose 1095€ on the casino. After this I contacted the casino via whatsapp and stated, that I had contacted them multiple times asking for self-exclusion without any progess. I also asked for a refund of my deposits. The casino representative responded that they have never been made aware of my gambling addiction and that my account was now closed. I was very surprised, that all of a sudden they were able to close my account via whatsapp in just minutes! Isn't the casino going against their own terms here, as previously they stated account closure has to be done via e-mail? Why did they not close my account before, via live-chat or whatsapp?</p>
<p>Casino has now responded to me that they have acted as per their internal processes in such cirumcstances. However, I feel as though they have intentionally delayed my requests of being self-excluded. Could you please help me with this? I have screenshots of chats, e-mails and the most recent whatsapp messages attached here. All I want to get from this is refund of my recent deposits of 1095€, which I feel is right in this case.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
