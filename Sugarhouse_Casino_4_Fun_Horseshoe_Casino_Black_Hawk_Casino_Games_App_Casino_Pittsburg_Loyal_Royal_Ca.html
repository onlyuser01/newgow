<p>Intelitics will work with Aspers Group to help power the latter’s brand-new UK iGaming brand, Aspers Casino. Aspers Group is a prominent gaming entity in the United Kingdom and beyond, and it will now see Intelitics, a content marketing and analytics provider, spearhead its customer acquisition program.</p>
<p>Aspers Casino Taps Intelitics to Boost Affiliate Traffic</p>
<p>Aspers Group will rely on Intelitics’ advanced technological solution to help boost awareness for the brand. This will be mostly carried out through trusted affiliate partners that will benefit from real-time data and analytics.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Intelitics platform, affiliates will be able to manage their campaigns more efficiently and drive traffic to the Aspers Casino brand. Meanwhile, Aspers Casino is powered by Gaming Innovation Group, and it has not yet launched. It is set to go live in 2023 and it will leverage GiG’s Data Broker product to offer an event-driven and real-time stream of data points to the Intelitics platform as well.</p>
<p>All of this should translate into a seamless overall experience for affiliates looking to help Aspers Casino drive traffic as well. Aspers Group is happy to have added this new casino brand to its growing portfolio of brands having started in the United Kingdom back in 2005 and since grown exponentially to feature numerous other iGaming properties.</p>
<p>Intelitics VP of sales Allan Petrilli welcomed the opportunity as well and hailed Aspers Group’s prominent status in the United Kingdom. Petrilli said that Intelitics was thrilled to be helping Aspers Group with its affiliate and paid media activity and added:</p>
<p>Our platform provides access to the real-time data they need to monitor and track campaigns and fine-tune strategies as they go to ensure they achieve the best possible results. It can also help Asper’s traffic partners improve their performance, too. Intelitics VP of sales Allan Petrilli</p>
<p>Not least, Petrilli also added that paid media and affiliate marketing is a great ways for brands such as Aspers Casino to boost their reach and attract new audiences. Aspers Casino Group CEO Richard Noble was similarly pleased with the development and hailed the opportunity to advance the brand’s reach through paid media and affiliate operations.</p>
<p>He noted that spending smart was key to success and that was precisely what Aspers Casino would seek to achieve with its tie-up with Intelitics. Noble said that this partnership would be the foundation of the brand’s “performance and paid marketing activity,” which can have very strong positive net gains for Aspers Casino.</p>
