<p>The battle over Pope County’s proposed casino project continues to rage on in court with the latest chapter of the legal battle ending with the dismissal by circuit judge Wendell Griffen. The judge took into consideration a lawsuit filed against the Cherokee Nation Businesses by the Citizens for a Better Pope County which seeks to stop the building of the Legends Resort and Casino in Russellville at all costs.</p>
<p>Lawsuit Thrown Out as Pope County Casino Resistance Continues</p>
<p>The judge, however, found no injury or threatened injury, and said that the plaintiffs had failed to include all necessary parties. This decision is not final, though, as judge Griffen has allowed the group to appeal if they choose to. As the court battle continues, though, no construction may begin. Pope County was among four original locations that state voters backed as a possible place to host a new casino resort in a bid to boost local economies, with casinos running in Pine Bluff, Hot Springs, and West Memphis.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest development, Citizens for a Better Pope County said they would not give up and they would continue to fight what they described as a corrupt process. More steps will be undertaken by the group in the coming days. Cherokee Nation Businesses CEO Chuck Garrett similarly issued a statement and said that the company was pleased with the recent success in court. He confirmed that thanks to this dismissal, the Cherokee Nation Businesses only has one case pending against it before it can break ground and commence construction.</p>
<p>The proposed Legends Resort &amp; Casino, said Garrett, would come with serious economic benefits for local communities and the economy. The one remaining lawsuit Garrett is referring to will be heard in court on January 3, 2023. It’s a case brought by Gulfside, the former license holder, which is challenging the operating experience of Legends Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>The objection says that this newly-setup project lacks operational experience in the gaming industry and would not be beneficial to Pope County when Gulfside is a far more suitable candidate. Cherokee Nation Businesses, though, which owns the business, has the necessary gaming expertise to continue, runs the counterargument.</p>
