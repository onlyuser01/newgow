    <h1>Casino Near Me With Buffet Casino Dice Game Gilpin Casino Prairies Edge Casino Mn Real Money No Depo</h1>

<p>On March 27, 2023 I deposited the sum of 990 euros with my Hype Mastercard account card with the final 8247. I played roulette and managed to win 644 euros. On 28 March 2023 I requested a withdrawal of 1634.80 euros and these gentlemen asked for both a copy of the hype card used to deposit and a copy of the account ownership. Sent all ok.</p>
<p>The problem arises with another request from agent Tamara.</p>
<p>I was also asked for a copy of an imaginary credit card with the ending 9269 which I have never registered on planetwin.</p>
<p>Well with this excuse I have the withdrawal blocked and pending since March 28th.</p>
<p>I'm surprised how it could be possible to ask for a copy of a credit card with the ending 9269 that I don't own and that has never been registered in my profile?</p>
<p>I would not have expected this petty action by Planetwin and with this diabolical ploy they don't want to pay me the winnings of 1,634.80</p>
<p>Beware of this bookmaker</p>
