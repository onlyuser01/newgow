    <h1>Queens Casino Hollywood Casino Bangor Maine Hollywood Casino Hotel Tunica Hotels Near Chumash Casino</h1>

<p>Hello dear guru, on June 29th, 2022 I made a €100 deposit on Stake 7 and took the €777 bonus with me.</p>
<p>After Wager and a couple of bigger hits it was almost 3800€.</p>
<p>€3200 has now been paid out. Immediately I was asked to submit my data for verification.</p>
<p>Said done, nothing. Asked in live chat for the first time on Monday. "It would be done soon"</p>
<p>Tuesday same game.</p>
<p>Thursday, confirmation of payment, asked again last night.</p>
<p>This morning I received an email saying that my money had been returned and the payment had been rejected.</p>
<p>Here is my "response to the mail from Stake7"</p>
<p>Do you actually read your own terms and conditions?</p>
<p>Is this a bad joke?</p>
<p>Please take a look at your screenshot again</p>

<p>Subject: Request for withdrawal</p>
<p>Hello M<strong><em>*</em></strong>,</p>
<p>We are writing to you regarding your withdrawal request of €3200.00.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we had to decline your withdrawal request due to a breach of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Winnings were made playing with a bonus on restricted games (Dragon Tiger). By placing bets on restricted games during the bonus rollover, you breached the terms and conditions of the promotion and as a result your withdrawal request was denied and any winnings generated were void. Attached is the copy of the Terms and Conditions for your reference.</p>
<p>Your initial deposit of €100.00 has been credited to your cash balance.</p>
<p>Sincerely, hindi</p>
