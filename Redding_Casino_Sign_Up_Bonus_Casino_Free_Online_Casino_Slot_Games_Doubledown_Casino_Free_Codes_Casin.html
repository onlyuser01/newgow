<p>NeoGames’s aggregation and content brand Pariplay has added Slotmill, a respected game studio in the iGaming industry, to its list of Ignite partners. As a result, Pariplay will help Slotmill distribute its content with new operators and reach fresh audiences. Slotmill will benefit from easy and scalable access to regulated markets, which will allow the studio to expand in markets that currently Pariplay operates.</p>
<p>Pariplay Boosts Slotmill Reach, Cuts Costs</p>
<p>More importantly, Pariplay has a strong distribution network which makes it for Slotmill far easier to inject its portfolio directly into the libraries of prominent companies from the sector. The studio will also be able to benefit from Pariplay’s turnkey development framework for its own game-development purposes and efforts.</p>
<p>This will translate into even quicker delivery to markets with launches supported by a suite of engagement solutions to make it even more worthwhile. Slotmill is presently licensed under a Malta Gaming Authority license, giving the company reach and scalability as well as good reputational standing in the industry.</p>
<p>The development process itself is executed to create a premium variety of games that utilize advanced math models and have a strong emphasis on functional, intuitive, and beautifully designed user interfaces. All the games developed by Slotmill are super lightweight, allowing for additional flexibility and even simpler integration.</p>
<p>Through Ignite, Slotmill will further reduce the costs of its development and integrations and empower operators globally. Commenting on this new alliance, Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris welcomed the latest expansion of the Ignite program with no other company than Slotmill. Harris added:</p>
<p>Its attention to detail, and focus on making immersive, lightweight games matches perfectly with our strategy, and we’re confident they will be an excellent addition to our Ignite program. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris</p>
<p>Slotmill founder Johan Ohman was similarly pleased to see his studio join Pariplay’s Ignite program and have better content reach opportunities “The scope of our operations can be enhanced swiftly, as we can now take our content live in numerous regulated markets, allowing us to scale rapidly as we achieve success together,” Ohman said offering insight into the benefits of the alliance.</p>
<p>Pariplay has had several prominent commercial partnerships over the past weeks, including one with ESA Gaming and one with Reloaded Gaming. Pariplay similarly teamed up with Konami at the end of November.</p>
