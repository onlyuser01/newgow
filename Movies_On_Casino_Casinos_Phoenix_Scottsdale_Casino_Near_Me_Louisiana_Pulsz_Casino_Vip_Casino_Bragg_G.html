<p>Bragg Gaming, a leading B2B global gaming technology company, has penned a new deal with the leading online entertainment firm Bally’s Interactive. As per the agreement, the provider will power the operator’s brands with its premium iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming Will Power Bally’s Brands</p>
<p>Bragg Gaming agreed to provide its content to Bally’s Interactive’s online casino brands, which include JackpotJoy, Vera&amp;John and Virgin Casino. The supplier will arm the operators with hit slot games from its in-house studios. As a result, Bally’s will be able to engage its clients with games developed by Atomic Slot Lab and Indigo Magic studios, among others.</p>

<p>The agreement can be expanded to include more games from additional studios if Bally’s wishes so.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Confident About the Deal</p>
<p>Yaniv Sherman, CEO of Bragg Gaming Group, praised Bally’s Interactive for being a very reputable and recognizable online gaming company. He attributed the company’s growth to its ability to select the best games from industry-leading studios for its iGaming offerings.</p>
<p>Sherman noted that the agreement will help Bally’s diversify its offerings in many jurisdictions. Meanwhile, Bragg will be able to reach profitable new markets.</p>
<p>By bringing proprietary content from our Atomic Slot Lab and Indigo Magic studios, as well as games from our exclusive third-party portfolio, to Bally’s Interactive online brands in different jurisdictions around the world, we are expanding the reach of our most popular games that also offer us our best economic returns. Yaniv Sherman, CEO, Bragg Gaming</p>
<p>Sherman concluded that his team can’t wait to begin working alongside Bally’s Interactive’s team to establish new iGaming roadmaps.</p>
<p>Robeson Reeves, Bally’s Corporation’s president of interactive, also shared his thoughts about the new deal. He commended Bragg’s ability to quickly roll out and integrate games.</p>
<p>Bragg’s ability to offer games at speed and with simplicity into new markets is strategically important for us and we’re delighted to enter into this new partnership with a group that is quickly becoming one of the industry leaders. Robeson Reeves, president of interactive, Bally’s Corporation</p>
