<p>Egypt Sky review</p>
<p>Egypt Sky is a video slot coming from the EGT factory. This is a decent slot with a medium variance and the potential for some nice payouts. Even though it’s not one of the best slots coming from EGT it can still boost your balance a bit with some help from lady luck.</p>
<p>Theme and Visual Details</p>
<p>As you can already guess this slot is inspired by Ancient Egypt. No Egyptian slot is complete without Queen Cleopatra on the reels and you can also see a variety of other symbols which follow the theme like the Pyramids, Scarab and Chariot symbols.</p>
<p>The visual details in the slot are decent and the designers went for a vintage appearance in Egypt Sky.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Like in most other EGT slots the gameplay in Egypt Sky is fast. What makes the gameplay exciting in this slot is the fact that the game symbols can land stacked across the reels. This way you can score some very nice payouts even without triggering the bonus round.</p>

<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Egypt Sky is a 40 payline slot with 5 reels and 4 rows of symbols.</p>
<p>Players can bet anywhere from $0.40 to $8 per spin. The slot has an RTP value of 96.3% and a medium variance.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol in Egypt Sky is the Ankh and it will substitute for all other symbols in the slot except for the Scatter Pyramid symbol.</p>
<p>The Wild can land only on reels 1, 2 and 3. Each time the Wild can contribute to a winning combination it will expand to cover the entire reel.</p>

<p>The Scatter symbol in Egypt Sky comes in the form of a Pyramid. In order to trigger the free spins bonus you will need to land 3, 4 or 5 Scatters anywhere on the reels. In return you are awarded 3, 5 or 7 free spins accordingly, which unfortunately can’t be re-triggered in any way.</p>
<p>During the free spins every Wild symbol which lands on the reels expands to cover the entire reel and stays in position until the feature ends. You can clearly see that in order to score a massive payout in the game you will need to trigger the bonus with the maximum number of scatters and land 3 wilds on the reels in the first few spins of the feature.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Egypt Sky is a simple video slot which has decent visual details and a popular theme. But realistically the designers didn’t quite do a great job with the bonus feature. The number of free spins awarded in the feature is too low if you trigger the bonus with only 3 Scatters. You already know that it’s almost next to impossible to trigger a bonus round with the maximum 5 Scatters. This is why it’s going to be very hard to score a big payout in the bonus round and you will need a lot of luck to do that.</p>
