<p>GG.BET will work with ESIC for the creation of ESIC's Anti-Corruption Tutorial</p>
<p>The Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) announced it has entered into a three-year partnership with GG.BET to make the online sports and esports betting operator its Anti-Corruption Education Partner.</p>
<p>Deliver Education to Players and Stakeholders</p>
<p>ESIC used the return of the ESIC Global Esports Summit (EGES) at Excel London this week to unveil the agreement with GG.BET that will see the esports betting firm provide support to the global esports integrity watchdog in producing its Anti-Corruption Tutorial.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new development, ESIC’s director of Global Strategy and Partnerships, Stephen Hanna, stressed that partnerships like the one with GG.BET are critical about the watchdog’s “mission of promoting integrity and preventing corruption in esports.”</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for their support and look forward to working together over the next three years to create a stronger, safer esports industry for all,” Hanna added.</p>
<p>Central to the partnership, ESIC’s Anti-Corruption Tutorial will seek to educate players and stakeholders in the esports industry by providing valuable resources needed to shape ethical behavior and foster a culture of integrity and transparency.</p>
<p>Healthy Competition in Esports is Key</p>
<p>Dmytro Voshkarin, chief executive officer of GG.BET, emphasized the “significant amount of effort” the betting firm has invested into the development of esports over the past few years aimed at creating a safe and fair environment and working closely with teams “to ensure healthy competition in esports.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be working with ESIC, a partner with whom we share a common passion for bringing integrity to esports, and we believe this tutorial will be helpful in achieving this goal,” Voshkarin concluded.</p>
<p>Another element of the agreement with ESIC is that GG.BET has expanded its partnership with the global esports integrity watchdog to become a Tier 1 Anti-Corruption Supporter and affirm its commitment to contributing to the creation of a fair and secure esports industry environment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, the esports betting company has a presence across Europe, Asia and Latin America, supporting international tournaments, sponsoring streams and creating esports content in collaboration with experts, casters and influencers. GG.BET has active sponsorships with NAVI and Team Vitality CS:GO.</p>
<p>Following hot on the heels of ESIC’s first Anti-Cheat partnership with platform cybersecurity specialist Denuvo by Irdeto, the Anti-Corruption Education partnership with GG.BET represents another major step forward for ESIC.</p>
<p>As the global guardian of the integrity of esports, ESIC works to promote integrity, prevent corruption and protect youth in esports by continually tackling all forms of cheating and malpractice, including match manipulation and doping.</p>
