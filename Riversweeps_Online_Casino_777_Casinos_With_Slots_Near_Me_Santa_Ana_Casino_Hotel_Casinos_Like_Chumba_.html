<p>The leading provider of quality online casino games, 7777 gaming, announced a new European-facing partnership. On Monday, the company revealed it joined forces with one of the most influential and largest operators for the regulated gambling sector in Romania, Superbet.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement with the Romanian premier online operator, the iGaming content supplier agreed to deliver a portfolio of some of its most popular games. Superbet will offer two new games per week to celebrate the new agreement. Moreover, the operator will run a thrilling month-long marketing campaign that will go on through December.</p>
<p>Per the new partnership, 25 of the most played and certified games from 7777 gaming will bring new experiences for Superbet's customers. The iGaming content provider agreed to deliver four exclusive titles: Zeus Quest, Pearl of Egypt, Greenhats' Megawins and Club Mr. Luck. Each of those games has already proven its popularity in markets across the globe and will now reach Superbet players in Romania. The two companies vowed that more exceptional games can be expected during the month-long campaign.</p>
<p>Raluca Varzaru, Superbet's Gaming Content Executive, shared her excitement about the deal with 7777 gaming.
