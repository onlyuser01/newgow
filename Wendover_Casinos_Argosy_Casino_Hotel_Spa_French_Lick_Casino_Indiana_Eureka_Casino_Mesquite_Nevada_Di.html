<p>The Toronto Raptors haven’t had a chance to hold a parade to celebrate NBA Championship, and already there’s bigger news making headlines across the league thanks to the Los Angeles Lakers trading for superstar Anthony Davis.</p>

<p>ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski Saturday night that the Lakers and New Orleans Pelicans reached a deal for the 6-10 center. In return, the Lakers agreed to send point guard Lonzo Ball, small forward Brandon Ingram, shooting guard Josh Hart, and three first-round draft picks.</p>
<p>The picks involved include this year’s fourth pick in the draft, meaning the Pelicans, who won the top pick in the draft lottery, now hold two of the top picks this year.</p>
<p>Davis, 26, is a six-time all-star and a three-time All-NBA performer. In 56 games this past season, he averaged 25.9 points and 12 rebounds a game.</p>
<p>While the trade cannot officially take place until next month, when the 2019-20 season calendar begins, it didn’t stop Lakers star LeBron James from chiming in on the deal.</p>
<p>AD on da way!!! Let’s get it bro! Just the beginning,” James said on his Instagram account Saturday night.</p>
<p>Within an hour of his post, it already received more than 1.3 million likes.</p>
<p>Odds-Changing Trade</p>
<p>When the sportsbooks initially set up their odds for the 2020 NBA title, oddsmakers considered the Lakers contenders despite the fact they missed out on the 2019 playoffs. That’s because many expected the team to make moves, either in free agency, the trade market, or both.</p>
<p>A month ago, after the Pelicans won the draft lottery, Caesars sportsbook listed the Lakers title chances at 20-1. On Saturday night, moments after the news broke, Caesars made them the 7-2 favorites to win the title.</p>

<p>Other futures propositions involving the Lakers were also affected by the trade. PointsBet previously listed the over-under on the team’s regular season wins next year at 51.5. With Davis in the fold, the total jumped to 56.5.</p>
<p>On Thursday, FanDuel’s book listed the Lakers as their co-fourth choice as their +850 odds were tied with Houston. Saturday night, the sportsbook the Lakers joined the Milwaukee Bucks and the Toronto Raptors as favorites, each sporting +550 odds.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook had the Lakers as their 2020 favorites after the Finals ended Thursday, with odds of 9-2. On Saturday, those odds went down to 3-1.</p>
<p>Trade Analysis</p>
<p>While the Davis trade gives the Lakers a second star to complement James, there are still plenty of questions surrounding the team. One issue team officials will need to address is who will handle point guard duties, especially now that Ball has been traded and the team gave up its first round pick this year. Most pundits agree the Lakers, who have significant room left in their salary cap, could go after a player like Kemba Walker to round out their starting lineup.</p>
<p>And while the Pelicans likely won’t be in the running for a title this year – the SuperBook has them at 60-1, FanDuel lists them at +10000, and PointsBet gives them +15000 odds – they will have an intriguing young core that could be a threat in a couple of years.</p>
<p>Duke’s power forward Zion Williamson is all but certain to be the top pick in Thursday’s draft, and some believe he’s the type of player who can transform a lottery team into a contender. Ingram gives them a player who averaged 18.3 points a game as a 21-year-old. Ball had a down year, but he also is just 21.</p>
