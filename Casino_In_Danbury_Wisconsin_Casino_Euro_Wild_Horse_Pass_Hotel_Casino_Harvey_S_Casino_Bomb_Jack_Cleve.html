<p>Global Payments and IGT are deepening their collaboration on cashless payment options with another five-year partnership.</p>
<p>Casino Players to Enjoy Cashless Options Thanks to IGT and Global Payments</p>
<p>International Game Technology (IGT) has not just debuted a cashless payment solution at the height of the pandemic. The company is now seeking further opportunities to consolidate the technology’s standing in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Through a new multi-year partnership with Global Payments, IGT is hoping to do just that. IGTPay is a casino-floor solution that allows consumers to make seamless digital payments without the need to touch or handle money themselves. Plus, the method adds transparency and comfort to the experience.</p>
<p>With Covid-19 bringing up many new challenges in the United States and beyond, IGT has hurried to endorse a technology that can offset at least some of the issues a highly-contagious infection has forced on the industry.</p>
<p>Sanitization protocols aside, IGT is giving players a quick and easy way to access bank funds. This includes mobile, online and while at a physical venue. Once a player has registered, they are able to transfer funds from their bank accounts into the digital wallets and vice versa in a single-step process.</p>
<p>Commenting on the technology, IGT VP for Video Lottery Terminal, System and Payments Products, Ryan Reddy, explained that simplicity was essential to customer adoption. The merits of technology alone are usually not sufficient to convert cash users into cashless players, Reddy explained.</p>
<p>Rather, IGT focused on creating a technology that is convenient and simple to use, as this gives a greater incentive to adopt it. Global Payments is not a chance partner either. IGT first teamed up with the company back in 2016.</p>
<p>IGT and Global Payments Go Back Years</p>
<p>At the time, the two companies worked on IGT’s iLottery products, but this relationship has now evolved. IGT and Global Payments started working through IGTPay in 2018 to cover the PlayLottery products. Since then, this partnership has changed to feature all digital services offered by IGT.</p>
<p>Global Payments president for gaming solutions Christopher Justice has said that already some 3.5 million people pick Global Payments’ VIP Preferred solution to carry out various payments and enjoy responsible gaming. The company is also looking to connect IGT’s cashless payment options with other funding methods. That is payment options different from bank accounts.</p>
<p>IGT’s cashless wallet received regulatory approval in Nevada already. Numerous cashless initiatives have been introduced in Las Vegas and beyond. Boyd, Aristocrat and Sightline teamed up for more touchless payment options earlier this year. Meanwhile in Las Vegas, Golden Entertainment agreed to host the Marker Trax’s Quick Play system.</p>
