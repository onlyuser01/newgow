    <h1>New York Hotel Casino Desert Diamond Casino Entertainment Tucson Fort Lauderdale Seminole Hard Rock</h1>

<p>I am writing to file a serious complaint against amok casino, focusing on their failure to respect my self-exclusion and their role in encouraging my gambling behavior.</p>
<p>this should include all brands operated by infinzia ltd.</p>
<p>I have self-excluded from one of their websites (gemler) due to my gambling addiction. However, I found myself being lured into gambling on another of their related sites. This was facilitated by emails from the operator, which seemed to directly target my vulnerability and effectively drew me back into gambling. I have since then selfish with myself and talk to customer service about my issues several times before I made these vast and ridiculous big deposits.</p>
<p>The ease with which I could move from one excluded site to another within their network, coupled with their active encouragement, demonstrates a concerning disregard for responsible gambling practices and my well-being as a customer.</p>
<p>Despite being a known gambling addict, as evidenced by over 1000 emails sent to their customer service requesting small $5 bonuses, the operator allowed my gambling behavior to escalate to the point of depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>This situation not only reflects a breach of responsible gaming obligations but also suggests a systematic failure to protect customers who have shown clear signs of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am requesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A thorough review of my case, particularly focusing on why my self-exclusion on one site was not extended to prevent access to other sites within their network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An examination of the operator’s marketing practices and how they target customers who have self-excluded due to gambling problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A full refund of the deposits made after my initial self-exclusion, acknowledging the operator’s negligence in this matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The operator’s actions in this case appear to exploit my gambling addiction rather than provide the support and barriers necessary for recovery. This is not only ethically questionable but also a gross violation of responsible gambling standards.</p>
<p>I appreciate Casino Guru’s assistance in addressing this critical issue and ensuring that responsible gaming policies are rigorously enforced to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
