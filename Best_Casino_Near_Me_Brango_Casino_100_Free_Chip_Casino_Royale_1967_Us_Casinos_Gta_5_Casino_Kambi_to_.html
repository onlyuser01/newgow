<p>Supplier of sports betting technology and solutions Kambi Group announced today it has signed an agreement to provide del Lago Resort &amp; Casino in Waterloo, New York, with its on-property sportsbook solution.</p>
<p>New On-Property Partner</p>
<p>The agreement between Kambi and the land-based casino owned and operated by horse racing and entertainment operator Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) will see the leading supplier of sports betting technology provide its on-property betting solution and services to the casino in upstate New York.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new multi-year agreement, Kambi Group’s chief executive officer and co-founder, Kristian Nylén, could not hide his excitement “to sign del Lago Resort &amp; Casino” as Kambi’s newest on-property partner in New York.</p>
<p>New York is a state known for its passionate sports fans and we are committed to bringing our high-quality sports betting service to the customers of one of the premier properties in the state. Kristian Nylén, CEO, Kambi Group</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Kambi will deliver its best-in-class retail sports betting products and services to enhance sports betting operations at the casino which won the World Casino Award for North America’s Best Casino, as well as the New York’s Best Casino and Hotel award.</p>
<p>Pursuing the Best Casino Experience Possible</p>
<p>On behalf of del Lago Resorts &amp; Casino, the casino’s general manager, Lance Young, expressed his and his team’s contentment with the opportunity “to partner with Kambi and leverage their award-winning sports betting technology” in pursuit of the best casino experience possible for the casino patrons and guests.</p>
<p>“The addition of Kambi’s products and services to our retail sportsbook and modern casino floor will create an even more exciting viewing and betting experience on game days,” Young concluded.</p>
<p>The technology delivered by Kambi will complement the casino’s already extensive gaming floor, more than 100 square feet dominated by modern LED video screens, to help create an even more exciting betting experience for del Lago’s customers.</p>
<p>The agreement with del Lago Resort &amp; Casino is the second for Kambi with a land-based casino operator in February following the extension of its partnership with Sun International in Africa earlier in the month to continue to power the operator’s sports betting operations.</p>
<p>In January, Kambi teamed with Miami Valley Gaming, an operator of harness racing track and casino in Turtlecreek Township in Ohio, to power the operator’s sportsbook with its sports betting technology and services.</p>
<p>In December, Kambi signed a deal with Rei do Pitaco, a daily fantasy sports operator in Brazil, to provide it with sports betting technology.</p>
