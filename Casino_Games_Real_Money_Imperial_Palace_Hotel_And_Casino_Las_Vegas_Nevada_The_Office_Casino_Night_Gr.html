    <h1>Casino Games Real Money Imperial Palace Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nevada The Office Casino Night Gr</h1>

<p>A player at the Borgata Online Casino in New Jersey has had an enviable lucky break with a $2 wager that was turned into a $3m payday at Bison Fury, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release. The online casino, operated by BetMGM, has welcomed the news of seeing another player turn a minor wager into a big payday. This constitutes the largest payout the Borgata Online Casino has paid so far for 2023, and it may not be the last one.</p>
<p>Although exciting, the news is actually a little old. The jackpot happened in October, and the player who actually won chose to remain anonymous. Bison Fury, the game that was awarded the juicy reward, is actually the bespoke work of Entain, and it’s only available across BetMGM’s own casino platforms. Of course, Bison Fury is hardly the only jackpot story in October to write home about.</p>
<p>BetMGM has been able to provide a range of jackpot experiences designed to significantly elevate the player experience and send thrills down player spines. Among the titles that pay out a hefty sum are Dead Sea Scrolls, Loot’ En Khamun, Mirage Mega Magma, MGM Grand Millions, and of course Bison Fury.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there were more lucky winners during the month, including a $1.2m jackpot won on MGM Grand Millions from a $5 stake, and another $746,000 won once again from Bison Fury and once again from a $2 wager. The slot has proven mighty popular with players who are undoubtedly going to at least check out Bison Fury when they connect to a BetMGM casino platform next.</p>
<p>Commenting on the tremendous success of the $3-millon winner and fellow jackpot players, BetMGM VP of Gaming Angus Nisbet said that the company was very excited to see these events come to pass.</p>
<p>"In-house games like Bison Fury and MGM Grand Millions are a key differentiator at our award-winning online casino. We work tirelessly to create games like these that delight players," Nisbet explained.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, BetMGM has awarded $75m in jackpots so far in 2022, and the company is fairly confident that it can improve from last year’s results, which saw some $100m paid out in jackpots.</p>
<p>The win comes at a time when BetMGM is definitely focusing on marketing and branding its casino project a little more aggressively, featuring a recent campaign starring Vanessa Hudgens.</p>
