<p>The main shareholder will reinvest a portion of the sale proceeds into Entain CEE, the division handling operations in central and eastern Europe</p>
<p>Entain, the owner of well-known gambling brands such as Ladbrokes and Coral, has announced its plans to acquire STS Holding, a leading sports betting company based in Poland, in a deal worth approximately £750 million ($945 million). The bid has received approval from the two largest shareholders of STS, Mateusz Juroszek and Zbigniew Juroszek, who collectively own a significant 70% stake in the company.</p>
<p>Juroszek Family to Reinvest in Entain CEE, Securing 10% Ownership</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the Juroszek family will reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the sale into Entain CEE, the division responsible for operations in central and eastern Europe. This investment will grant them a 10% ownership in the unit, showcasing their continued commitment to the industry and ensuring their involvement going forward.</p>
<p>STS currently holds the dominant position in the Polish market, with 783,000 active users and a network of 400 physical betting shops, making it the largest network of its kind in the country. Founded in 1997, STS also holds licenses to operate not only in Poland but also the UK and Estonia. Recognizing the potential for growth, Entain believes that STS is well-positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in the event of full online casino liberalization in Poland.</p>
<p>Jette Nygaard-Andersen, the CEO of Entain, expressed her enthusiasm for the acquisition, stating that they were thrilled to be acquiring Poland’s leading sports betting operator. She mentioned that STS operated in a rapidly expanding and dynamic market and described it as an exceptional business with a strong brand. Nygaard-Andersen further highlighted that STS offered an appealing omnichannel experience and was led by a highly skilled CEO and management team.</p>
<p>Entain Strengthens European Expansion Strategy with STS Acquisition and 365scores Deal</p>
<p>The successful acquisition of STS will strengthen Entain‘s market presence and enhance its operations in central and eastern Europe. Leveraging STS’s market expertise and established position in Poland, Entain intends to consolidate its platform in the region and continue its ambitious expansion plans throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Entain also recently completed the acquisition of global sports media company 365scores for $150 million. The deal strengthens Entain’s position by providing enhanced content and interactive offerings to its customers, leveraging 365scores’ expertise in data-driven sports media content.</p>
<p>These deals aligned with Entain’s broader global strategy for growth and follow recent acquisitions, including the purchase of Sportsflare, a provider of esports wagering products.</p>
<p>Entain’s strong financial performance in FY22 and the first quarter of 2023 further reinforced its optimistic outlook for the future.</p>
