<p>The Union Zolos are Great at Home</p>
<p>March 25, 2023 – that’s when Philadelphia Union lost a game at Subaru Park the last time. Since then, the Union Zolos are without a single home loss, winning most of their games in PA. In the 2023 Leagues Cup, they’ve played all of their five games at home. They won three of those in regulation, while two of their wins happened after a penalty shootout.</p>
<p>The wins in the 90 minutes of regular time happened against teams that are nowhere near Inter Miami in terms of player quality. The teams in question are Queretaro and Club Tijuana, which are among the least valuable clubs from the Mexican Liga MX.</p>
<p>It’s Queretaro that Philly defeated twice. In the opening round of the 2023 Leagues Cup, the Union Zolos won 5-1, but when they met again in the quarterfinal, it was a really tough game. Philadelphia won 2-1 but only thanks to a goal scored by Chris Donovan in the 11th minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>Inter Miami Looking Unstoppable Right Now</p>
<p>We’re at the semifinal stage of the 2023 Leagues Cup, and Inter Miami is the No. 1 favorite to win the trophy with the betting odds of +160. In comparison, Philadelphia’s odds are +300 right now. The reason why the Herons are expected to win is that they’ve got Lionel Messi on the roster.</p>
<p>The soccer GOAT has been nothing short of sensational since coming to America, scoring eight goals in five games thus far. In each of those matches, he was Inter Miami’s best player. The Messiah was their savior on two occasions when he scored a late goal.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, however, it wasn’t just Messi who impressed. For the first time in the 2023 Leagues Cup, Gerardo Martino’s team performed like a real collective. They defeated Charlotte FC 4-0, with Messi and two other players scoring a goal (one of Charlotte’s players scored an own goal as well).</p>
<p>Philadelphia Union vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Josef Martinez, Robert Taylor, DeAndre Yedlin, and Leonardo Campana all played very well against Charlotte, and we expect them to continue doing that in the upcoming fixtures. We also expect two newcomers from Barca – Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba – to start showing up.</p>
<p>They haven’t done great since signing for Inter Miami, but everyone knows they’re world-class players. Maybe they’ll lift their performance to the next level on Tuesday evening? We think they might, but even if they don’t, the Herons will still have Messi to save the day.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
