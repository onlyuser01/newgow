<p>‘I Dew’: Man to Wed Mountain Dew Can in Las Vegas Publicity Stunt</p>

<p>A man plans to marry a can of Hard Mountain Dew on Wednesday night in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Before this publicity stunt, the Little Vegas Chapel’s biggest previous claim to fame was reportedly being housed in a former Rat Pack nightclub. (Image: littlevegaschapel.com)</p>
<p>In a publicity stunt cooked up by brand managers of the alcoholic PepsiCo product to generate articles exactly like this, Thomas Rank of Avon, Ind., won a free Vegas marriage to the beverage of his dreams at the Little Vegas Chapel. The “Hard Dew, I Do” contest was open to singles of all sexes this summer.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seen the crazy lengths people will go for Hard Mountain Dew, so offering up a legendary wedding in Sin City is our way of saying thanks,” explained a statement from Erica Taylor, one of the Hard Mountain Dew brand managers willing to actually accept responsibility for this</p>
<p>Contestants were asked to submit “a personalized wedding proposal that shows the brand why they’re the one to spend a lifetime of happiness together,” according to a corporate press release that mentions the beverage’s name 24 times. Rank’s proposal was judged on “imagination, originality, and most importantly, love of Hard Mountain Dew.” (See?)</p>
<p>Rank and a guest won an all-expenses-paid two-night Vegas vacation, a reception at “one of Las Vegas’ hottest clubs,” a custom wedding ring, and a $1,000 wedding gift.</p>
<p>Vegas is still the “marriage capital of the world” (although that refers to real weddings, not publicity stunts.) There are currently more than 150 marriages a day, according to lasvegasnevada.gov. This is because, unlike most states, couples don’t face a waiting period, so you can get a license and be officially married in the same day. Waiting periods elsewhere in different states ranging from 1-6 weeks.</p>
<p>Little Chapel Going Big</p>
<p>This man’s wedding to this can will also represent the first national press received by the Little Vegas Chapel. Not established until 2013, this matrimonial underdog doesn’t have the long track record of failed celebrity marriages boasted by its competitors’ websites.</p>
<p>No Britney Spears and Jason Alexander. (That was at the Little White Wedding Chapel.) No Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie. (That was at Little Church of the West.) No Sinead O’Connor and Barry Herridge. (The Little White Wedding Chapel again.)</p>
<p>However, the building housing the Little Vegas Chapel was reportedly opened in 1954 as a mafia nightclub frequented by members of the Rat Pack.</p>
<p>Branding ‘Pretend Marriages”</p>
<p>According to the Little Vegas Chapel’s website, it offers a service called “pretend weddings.”</p>
<p>Say ‘I Do!’ without the legal paperwork,” the website states. “‘Get ‘married’ to your best friend for life, your longtime partner, your cellphone, anything really!”</p>
<p>Hopefully, that’s what this is. Because while marriages to inanimate objects are not illegal, no US state will recognize one as legally valid. In addition, we must point out that alcoholic beverages and marriage are not usually a good combination.</p>
