<p>The sports data and technology company that provides data management, streaming and integrity services, Genius Sports, announced it decided to expand its existing long-term collaboration with the leading Czech sportsbook operator, Tipsport. The company said Thursday that it will increase the number of annual events it covers for Tipsport.</p>
<p>The duo builds upon an existing collaboration from 2016. Now, thanks to the partnership extension, Tipsport will benefit from additional events covered by Genius' LiveData, LiveTrading and PreMatch solutions. At the same time, the company will keep the same control over its sportsbook.</p>
<p>Petr Komarek, Tipsport's Head of Data and Streaming, shared his excitement in a statement released on June 30, 2022. He said: "Never-ending innovation is firmly part of our DNA so we're thrilled to widen our partnership with Genius Sports for the upcoming years."</p>
<p>Komarek pointed out that Tipsport and Genius Sports enjoy a strong business relationship. He outlined that the company is excited to provide its customers with more world-class services. "We look forward to create compelling and unique projects together," said Komarek in conclusion.</p>
<p>Jack Davison, Genius Sports' Chief Commercial Officer, added: "Since the start of our partnership in 2016, we have worked closely with Tipsport to provide them with a growing suite of betting products and services that drive turnover, increase margins and maximize control." He also pointed out that the company is excited to continue its collaboration with Tipsport and power its sportsbook.</p>
<p>The expanded partnership will deliver real-time feeds and pricing for hundreds of competitions, such as the NCAA, NFL, EPL and Euroleague Basketball. Moreover, the collaboration will see Genius grant Tipsport access to its complete NFL product suite. In turn, Tipsport will leverage Next Gen Stats (NGS), official sports wagering data feed, as well as real-time statistics and data.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Genius explained it will "deliver thousands of low latency streams through its rapidly expanding Streaming solution." This will bring live streams that will create unique live betting experiences for Tipsport sports fans of leading FIVB volleyball, FIBA basketball and football leagues across China, Colombia, Iceland and Argentina.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Genius announced another collaboration with the leading provider of intelligence and investigation software, Clue. Consequently, the duo launched the most comprehensive sports integrity intelligence platform.</p>
<p>Founded more than two decades ago, Genius is an unquestionable leader in collecting and managing sports data. Currently, the company is an integrity partner for more than 150 federations and leagues around the world. Such leagues include the PGA TOUR, NFL, EPL, DFB, BWF and many more.</p>
