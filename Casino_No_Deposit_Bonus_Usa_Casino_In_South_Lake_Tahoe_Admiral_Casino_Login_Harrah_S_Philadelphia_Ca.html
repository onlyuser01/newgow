<p>Genius Sports, a data, technology and broadcast partner that powers the global ecosystem connecting sports, betting and media, has published its financial results for the second quarter of the year, highlighting its recent successes. The company’s revenue for the period exceeded the company’s expectations, causing it to update its guidance.</p>
<p>As reported by Genius Sports, its revenue exceeded the Q2 guidance of $80 million, sitting at $86.8 million at the end of the quarter. This represents a year-on-year increase of 22%.</p>
<p>Betting technology revenue increased by 27% year-on-year. Media technology and sports technology revenues, on the other hand, increased by 22% and 3%, respectively.</p>
<p>The company also reported group adjusted EBITDA of $15.7 million, which exceeds the guidance of $14 million. Year-to-date group adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, more than quadrupled year-on-year to a stellar $24 million.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Genius Sports reported lower loss from operations. Whereas the company lost $39.7 million in Q2, 2022, it lost only $7.8 million in Q2, 2023. The favorable results were attributed to the improved underlying performance but the improvement was sadly offset by a $29 million reduction in gain on foreign currency.</p>
<p>Genius Sports updated its group revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year, following its spectacular performance during the quarter. According to Genius Sports, the company now expects group revenue to reach $410 million, instead of $400 million.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA guidance, meanwhile, was updated from $49 million to $52 million. In addition, the company expects to expand group adjusted EBITDA margins from 5% in 2022 to 13% in 2023.</p>
<p>Q2 Was a Productive Period for the Company</p>
<p>In its report, Genius Sports also highlighted some of its achievements in Q2, which include, among other things, an extension of its strategic partnership with the National Football League. Moreover, it extended its official data partnership with Football DataCo.</p>
<p>Another sports agreement was an AI-powered tech expansion with the EPL and EFL through cutting-edge Second Spectrum technology. Genius also supplied the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia &amp; New Zealand 2023 with innovative digital features, once again using Second Spectrum.</p>
<p>Genius Sports also expanded its integrity program with The German Football Association and secured a bunch of accolades, including Best Technology for College Sports at the Sports Technology Awards 2023 and the Sports Betting Supplier award at the EGR North America Awards 2023.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Locke commented on the performance. He said that the company has reached a “significant inflection point in its business.”</p>
<p>Locke said: “The ongoing success through the second quarter perfectly demonstrates our balanced approach in delivering near-term results, while accelerating Genius towards our long-term growth and profit targets.”</p>
