<p>FashionTV Gaming Group, the exclusive licensor of FashionTV in the gaming industry, teams up with global gaming supplier NetEnt and Red Tiger, a leading casino developer, to launch the first video slot, inspired by a song from the FashionTV channel by Anja J., called ‘I Want to be a Trillionaire.”</p>
<p>FashionTV Gaming Group, NetEnt, and Red Tiger Take iGaming to a Whole New Level</p>
<p>The 5-reel video slot, Trillionaire, named after the song, invites players to enjoy a new immersive, luxurious experience. The slot game, intending to reach billions of people, is the first result of the teamwork between FashionTV Gaming Group, NetEnt, and Red Tiger. Trillionaire is designed to become popular and appeals to a broad range of players worldwide. Red Tiger did the integration and the design elements of the slot. Trillionaire’s launch follows the announcement of the FashionTV Gaming Group and NetEnt partnership deal at ICE 2020.</p>
<p>FashionTV Gaming Group’s unique approach aims to continue wowing the industry with its originality. With its Brand to Business model, the company gives market leaders the chance to create their luxury products using the FashionTV brand.</p>
<p>Trillionaire features real FashionTV supermodels and brings the slot game experience to a whole new level. This new slot game introduces the coveted lifestyle of FashionTV directly to players as it merges the online world with the real one. With its Free Spins mode, the slot allows players to select 1 of 5 supermodels that will go wild, and when the players reach the fourth circle of the Fashion Wheel, they will land on a mega win.</p>
<p>Todd Haushalter, Chief Product Officer at Evolution, said that Trillionaire provides an immersive player experience and combines the glamour and elegance of FashionTV. The slot game marks the partnership of FashionTV and NetEnt, which would set the brand’s iGaming content on a new course.</p>
<p>Shai Kaplun, COO at FashionTV Gaming Group, stated that the glamorous lifestyle and the luxurious brand make Trillionaire a unique, immersive, and exciting gaming experience. FashionTV Gaming Group was thrilled with the results brought from its cooperation with NetEnt, and Red Tiger’s creative work. The slot will boost the brand’s presence in the iGaming industry as FashionTV will move forward into the future, creating more products that will offer a real luxurious player experience.</p>
<p>NetEnt Is on Its Way to Stardom</p>
<p>NetEnt recently joined Michigan’s newly legalized gaming market. This move strengthened its position as a leading provider in the U.S. Recently, the supplier also transformed the Aloha! Cluster Pays slot for the 2020 Christmas by bringing a holiday vibe to players during Christmas time, which shows its ability to transform and create a thematic gaming experience. There is no doubt that NetEnt will help the FashionTV Gaming Group to bring glamour and luxury to the iGaming industry.</p>
