<p>Supplier of unique online casino content and software solutions Tom Horn Gaming announced today that its presence across regulated gaming markets in Europe expanded as Spain became the latest jurisdiction to receive the developer’s slot portfolio.</p>
<p>Build Long-Lasting Presence</p>
<p>Tom Horn Gaming is entering the Spanish online gaming market and already secured full certification of some of its titles among which blockbuster slots 81 Frutas Grandes, 243 Crystal Fruits and The Secret of Ba.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Tom Horn’s chief executive officer Ondrej Lapides focused on the potential for growth the iGaming market in Spain presents and the company’s strong intention to “exploit these opportunities together with TonyBet.”</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see how our titles are received by Spanish players and we’re confident that we have all the right products and tools to build a long-lasting business relationship with our partners in Spain.” Ondrej Lapides, CEO, Tom Horn Gaming</p>
<p>Tom Horn’s portfolio of slots is set to reach online casino players in Spain via TonyBet after the developer extended its collaboration with SoftSwiss.</p>
<p>On behalf of Tom Horn’s partner, TonyBet, key account manager Davis Skulte outlined the company’s ambition to “deliver the best-in-class experience” to its customers and that what Tom Horn Gaming offers entirely fits the bill.</p>
<p>“Their expertise, attitude and dedication to delivering highly engaging, innovative games localized for the Spanish market are on par with our own business philosophy.” Davis Skulte, Key Account Manager, TonyBet</p>
<p>“We are extremely positive that this will result in an effective partnership and mutual growth in Spain and beyond,” Skulte concluded.</p>
<p>European Expansion Continues</p>
<p>The agreement with TonyBet is the latest reached by Tom Horn Gaming in its efforts to expand the reach of its slot titles in European gaming markets, following shortly after the slot games developer teamed with ComeOn Group. The distribution deal signed in June will see Tom Horn Gaming’s slot portfolio feature via ComeOn Group’s brands in Malta and Sweden through Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Earlier, Tom Horn Gaming expanded its market presence with a content deal with the iGaming and betting operator Interwetten to allow its players experience the engaging mechanics and gripping gameplay of top-performing slots 81 Frutas Grandes and Wolf Sierra, as well as other slot titles.</p>
<p>Tom Horn Gaming is determined to continue to expand its product reach and is already working on a number of new initiatives that will go beyond the slot vertical and will be launched in the coming weeks.</p>
