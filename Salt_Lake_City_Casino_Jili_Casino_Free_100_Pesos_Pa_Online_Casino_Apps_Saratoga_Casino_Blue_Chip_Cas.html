<p>NeoGames: a leading iLotto provider with grand plans</p>
<p>NeoGames started trading in 2005, setting its sights on the online lottery industry. Back then, internet lotto games were very basic, and NeoGames aimed to develop modern solutions that would tempt more people to play online.</p>
<p>The company's product range included its NeoSphere platform, which it supplied to online operators, and a selection of instant lotto-style games.</p>
<p>In 2014, after a string of successful partnerships, NeoPollard was formed – a product of an alliance between NeoGames and Canadian lottery firm Pollard BankNote. Described by experts as the most successful iLotto vendor in the United States, it has won several EGR awards and was responsible for around 70% of total US iLottery revenue in 2020.</p>
<p>Note: This success prompted NeoGames to raise $94 million in a 2020 share offering, which included publicly trading on Nasdaq under the symbol NGMS. By this point, it had already struck a 'strategic partnership deal' with major gambling firm William Hill, which bought just under 30% of NeoGames as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Since then, NeoGames has shown no signs of slowing down. The company announced partnerships that enabled it to expand into the Austrian and Turkish markets in 2021, and it harbors plans to increase its size, making a $420 million bid to acquire Aspire Global.</p>
<p>With its considerable size, solid reputation, and licenses from several gambling authorities (including the MGA), we consider NeoGames to be a secure gaming provider, and one to watch for the future.</p>
<p>NeoGames games and software</p>
<p>NeoGames is an iLottery specialist, and all of its games have lotto-based elements to them, where the player's success comes down to fortune, rather than any level of skill.</p>
<p>The company divides its gaming stock into three categories, which we could label as variants of Lotto games:</p>
<p>eInstant</p>
<p>eScratch</p>
<p>Keno</p>
<p>eInstant</p>
<p>As the name suggests, these games are based on the idea of instant wins (or losses). As the player, you're given a grid of random numbers: your prize is then based on how many of those match the winning numbers. Often these games will include some nice features, like in Frost and Flame, you can choose whether you play on an icy or fiery setting; plus, you can land bonus prizes.</p>
<p>eScratch</p>
<p>A variation on eInstants where you uncover or 'scratch' each section of the grid to reveal the symbol or number beneath. It adds an element of intrigue compared to standard eInstant games, and NeoGames offers some stylish eScratch themes, like the slick design of VIP Ultra.</p>
<p>Keno</p>
<p>While not the most popular casino choice, Keno games appeal to some players because of their quick, uncomplicated gameplay. The difference here, though, is that you get to choose your numbers, which may add a feeling of control although, in reality, it's still a pure game of chance.</p>
<p>NeoGames' Keno offerings include Instant Keno Multiplier, Top Shot Keno, and Instant Keno.</p>
<p>NeoGames software</p>
<p>All NeoGames titles are created by its in-house team of developers, and the company clearly knows what it's doing judging by the smooth feel of the games.</p>
<p>Part of its product range is the NeoSphere platform that it offers to internet operators. Incorporating a payment gateway, eWallet, and Player Account Management, it's a sophisticated system that demonstrates the company's technological prowess – something that you will see by playing its games.</p>
<p>How to choose the best NeoGames casino online</p>
<p>Finding a reliable casino is one of the golden rules of iGaming. If the site you're playing on can't be trusted to resolve customer complaints or pay out big wins, then, quite simply, it's not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>This is one of the main aims of Casino Guru: to help you find the best online casinos. Each casino has a special Safety Index next to it: this is a score based on objective factors, such as the size of the casino, the complaints it's received, and the quality of its related sites.</p>
<p>To see the NeoGames casinos that have the highest Safety Index, click on the 'Recommended' tab on this page. These are the sites you should start with. If you're a fan of new casinos, then the 'Newly opened' tab will show you the latest NeoGames casinos on our system.</p>
<p>There are also extra filters for you to choose from including:</p>
<p>Payment method</p>
<p>Find your preferred card or e-wallet by scrolling down this list and selecting the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Game type</p>
<p>NeoGames doesn't produce roulette or video poker games, but you may want to find a NeoGames site that does offer them by selecting them from this list.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/crypto casinos</p>
<p>More and more casinos are joining the crypto revolution: find the NeoGames-friendly ones here.</p>
<p>Language</p>
<p>Select your native language so that you can read instructions and terms and conditions with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Note: If you're unsure as to how we've reached some of our casino Safety Index ratings, then our How we review online casinos page will explain the thought process behind it in great detail.</p>
<p>NeoGames casino bonuses</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses can add something extra to your playing experience. Given as free credit or spins, you may even win something from them, although it probably won't be a big amount.</p>
<p>To find up-to-date bonuses offered by NeoGames casinos, start by looking at our list of casino bonuses and choosing 'NeoGames' in the gaming provider filter. You can sort these offers by their type if you wish: just go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and select the one you want, such as 'no deposit bonus'. Alternatively, you can go to our list of no deposit bonuses and select 'NeoGames' there.</p>
