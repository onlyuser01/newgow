    <h1>Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne Blue Water Casino Parker Az Salary Of A Casino Dealer Casi</h1>

<p>On Thursday, the gambling watchdog confirmed it imposed a regulatory action against Domiseda and Partners sro from Slovakia, as well as Equinox Dynamic NV from Curaçao. The €1.8 million ($1.9 million) total fine breaks down to €900,000 ($965,800) against each of the two operators.</p>
<p>The KSA said that it launched a probe into the operations of the online gambling website orientxpresscasino.com. Consequently, it uncovered that the website offered casino games without the necessary license. Dutch players had the option to participate in those games of chance, the regulator said. Considering that the companies “both acted as providers,” the regulator decided that a fine should be applicable for both.</p>
<p>Under the current gambling regulations active in the Netherlands, gambling operators are prohibited to offer games of chance without a license. Upon announcing the enforcement action, the KSA said that the two operators breached the Betting and Gaming Act in the country, which is why the two fines were introduced. This comes as no surprise, considering that the KSA is authorized to probe into the operations of online gambling companies and if necessary issue penalties.</p>
<p>Besides operating without a license, the KSA uncovered other deficiencies within its investigation. Those deficiencies, described by the regulator as “aggravating circumstances,” included a lack of age verification.</p>
<p>“Casino games were offered without a license on the website orientxpresscasino.com. Investigation revealed that Equinox Dynamic and Domiseda both acted as providers. That is why the Gaming Authority imposed a fine on both providers for the violation,“ reads a statement released by the KSA</p>
<p>Fines Issued by the Regulator Continue to Pile Up</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, KSA’s chairman, René Jansen, said that the regulator continues to monitor the gambling market. Ultimately, the regulator’s purpose is to help establish an online gambling environment that is safe for the customers that are interested in such entertainment, he explained. Last but not least, Jansen said that a vital part of the process of creating a safe environment is tough enforcement actions against bad actors.</p>
<p>“The objective is to create a safe environment for people who want to gamble online. This includes taking strict action against illegal providers.“ René Jansen, chairman of the Kansspelautoriteit</p>
<p>The latest enforcement comes after earlier this week, the KSA issued a €350,000 ($375,600) penalty against Bingoal, an online gambling operator. The action came due to failures related to the Dutch-self-exclusion program called Crucks.</p>
<p>Back in January, the KSA also slammed JOI Gaming with a $400,000 fine over deficiencies related to advertising. At the time, the regulator said that the operator engaged in advertising for young adults, which is prohibited under the current regulatory framework in the Netherlands.</p>
