    <h1>Pompano Casino Turning Stone Resort Casino Casino Baton Rouge Highest Payout Online Casino Login To</h1>

<p>It's been 15 days since requesting my payout withdrawals, with them only just being approved. There was 4 requestes (due to their max withdrawal requests available)</p>
<p>I was told the requests were "approved" upon requesting the withdrawal requests and speaking to customer service. I have since waited for them for 15 days to "officially" approve the requests. And still no sign of them making payment to me after completing all requested and required documentation.</p>
<p>I've tried communicating with the company on numerous occasions without even a reply email.</p>
<p>When they have replied, the agents have been unaware of what has been received, and unprofessionally prolonged the process by requesting again what has already been sent re paperwork and ID verification. Again having to tell them how to do their job, having to update them on the history of the account, having to repeat what they should already know regarding documentanting received and already verified by them.</p>
<p>Whether the consultants haven't been aware, or pretended not to know, where the process of the account is at regarding the withdrawal process. It's very frustrating and obviously they do anything to prolong the withdrawal process.</p>
<p>The process is so drawn out, still awating payment, i wont be a high depositing customer after this, as after winning for the first time in almost a year of depositing hundreds of dollars weekly, once you do win, if you do, its not worth it or rewarding. As im still waiting on my payments to be received, im not confident in the casino or getting my winnings paid out, even with them willing and agreeing to the payout.</p>
<p>I stressed the issue of the payment being urgent, needing the funds to fly to see a dying family member that has 3 months to live and they haven't been helpful or tried to make the process payout fair and within their " approval" times. The customer service is non responsive and unhelpful always finding a reason to be incompetent and irresponsible and unwilling to be able to complete their process as promised.</p>
<p>Yet to receive my agreed payout winnings.</p>
