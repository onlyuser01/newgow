    <h1>Saratoga Casino Hotel Legends Bay Casino Zone Casino Msn Pechanga Resort Casino Harrahs Casino San D</h1>

<p>Two NFC West foes meet in the Thursday Night Football game of Week 15 – the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners won their first duel of the season 27-7 (Week 2), in which Trey Lance started as their QB but then suffered a season-ending ankle injury. Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in as his replacement and was doing a great job until Week 13 when he too got injured.</p>
<p>As a result, the Niners starting signal-caller is now Brock Purdy, the Mr. Irrelevant of the 2022 NFL Draft. He’s played two games so far, impressive in both of them and helping his team get to 9-4 with six straight wins. They have two wins more than the Seahawks whose form isn’t great – they lost three of their four previous games.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s no surprise that bookies see the Niners as odds-on favorites in the Week 15 TNF game.</p>

<p>The Niners Look Unstoppable</p>
<p>If Kyle Shanahan’s boys win the TNF game, they’re going to secure their spot in the postseason. They will finish top of the NFC West table no matter what happens in the remainder of the season, the reason being that in that case, they’d have a better h2h record than the Seahawks, as well as the other two of their divisional rivals.</p>
<p>Knowing that they’re 6-0 since losing to the Kansas City Chiefs, it’s hard to imagine the Seahawks will stop their amazing run. The key to their success over the last two months is their incredible defense. The mere fact that they haven’t conceded more than 17 points since the Chiefs’ loss tells the entire story.</p>
<p>Plus, their offense has been amazing as well despite having the third-string quarterback in the starting role. We saw Brock Purdy come off the bench to replace Garoppolo in Week 13 and start the Week 14 game.</p>
<p>The young QB impressed in both of those games, throwing 25/37 for 210 yards and two touchdowns against the Miami Dolphins and going 16-for-21 for 185 yards and two TDs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks Heading in the Opposite Direction to the Niners</p>
<p>The Niners have been one of the most impressive NFL teams over the last couple of weeks. It’s been almost the opposite story when it comes to their divisional rivals, the Seattle Seahawks. Pete Carroll’s men are 7-6 on the season but have lost three of their previous four games.</p>
<p>What needs to worry them is that their defense was below par in most of those games. In fact, with 25.7 points allowed per game, their defense is the third worst in the NFL. The Niners’ defense, in comparison, is the no.1 in the league.</p>
<p>They might be able to stop San Fran’s rookie QB’s passing game, but we just cannot see them do anything against RB Christian McAffrey. Seattle is the second-worst team in the NFL in opponent rushing yards, as well as the third-worst team in opponents rushing TDs per game.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers vs Seattle Seahawks Prediction</p>
<p>The Niners are winning this game, we have no doubt about that. And it’s going to be a big win for Shanahan’s men. We expect their running game to wreak havoc on the Seahawks defense, with McCaffrey scoring at least one rushing touchdown on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win and cover the spread</p>
