    <h1>Golden Buffalo Casino Graton Resort And Casino Map Of Casinos In Las Vegas River Casino Pittsburgh C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to have my account with Hotbet finally terminated and have written an email to Hotbet Support.</p>
<p>On 05/13/23 at 10:37 am, Germany time .</p>
<p>I gave the reason:</p>
<p>I just don't feel like playing anymore. That is the only reason.</p>
<p>Hotbet support doesn't seem to care what I want and what I write.</p>
<p>A KAI employee wrote to me on 05/13/23 at 2pm to give a reason why I want to close/cancel my account.</p>
<p>As I said, I wrote:</p>
<p>I just don't feel like playing anymore. That is the only reason.</p>
<p>My reason is probably not accepted!</p>
<p>And that I don't want to permanently close my account either.</p>
<p>On 05/13/23 the employee VICTORIA wrote to me:</p>
<p>We would like to ask you if there is anything in particular that you do not like about our website? Maybe the offers or the chance to win? We appreciate any feedback on this!</p>
<p>If something bothers you, you can let us know!</p>
<p>I just want to close my account there because I don't want to play there anymore!</p>
<p>What's not to understand about it and why are you trying to persuade me to stay?</p>
<p>I want to permanently cancel the account and that's it!</p>
<p>I will no longer register there!</p>
<p>Pay no more!</p>
<p>Don't play anymore!</p>
<p>I have already unsubscribed from the newsletters.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions state that you should write an email to Hotbet Support if you close an account.</p>
<p>I did that, but Hotbet doesn't accept my cancellation/closure.</p>
<p>The general terms and conditions also state point 3. Account and personal information</p>
<p>3.15. Accounts having no recorded activity for a period of 6 months are considered inactive. Should an account be inactive for 6 consecutive months or longer (no deposit and betting/gaming activity), Hot.bet reserves all rights to terminate the customer's account, and therefore all outstanding balances are forfeited.</p>
<p>German :</p>
<p>3.15. Accounts that have had no activity for a period of 6 months are considered inactive. Should an account be inactive (no deposit and betting/gaming activity) for 6 consecutive months or more, Hot.bet reserves all rights to terminate the customer's account and any outstanding balances will be forfeited.</p>
<p>Do I have to wait 6 months until Hotbet deletes my inactive account because the support staff doesn't want to accept my cancellation now?</p>
<p>I have finally decided:</p>
<p>My Hotbet account should be permanently and immediately closed / terminated... without further discussion about it!</p>
<p>greeting</p>
