<p>DraftKings’ sports betting offerings are now live in a total of 22 states</p>
<p>DraftKings has published its Q3 2023 results, updating its guidance thanks to its strong performance.</p>
<p>The American betting company posted revenue of $790 million for the period – a figure that represents a staggering 57% year-on-year increase from the $502 million recorded in 2022.</p>

<p>The EBITDA guidance for 2023 and 2024 includes all of the company’s existing jurisdictions and its operations in Maine, Puerto Rico, Vermont and North Carolina where it is yet to launch.</p>
<p>DraftKings Attributed the Revenue to a Variety of Factors</p>
