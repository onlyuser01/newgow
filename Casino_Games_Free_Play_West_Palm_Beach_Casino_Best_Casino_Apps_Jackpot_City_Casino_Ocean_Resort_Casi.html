<p>The hotel is designed with highly luxurious experiences in mind, as the corporation seeks to redefine gambling in the region</p>
<p>The Jamul Indian Village Development Corporation (JIVDC) is expanding its Jamul Casino with a new hotel. The hospitality facility is already under construction and should welcome its first guests very soon, the tribal company said.</p>
<p>The boutique hotel will be 16 stories tall and will sport 200 rooms, including 52 luxurious suites. In addition to the rooms, the property will have a parking lot with a whopping 350 parking spaces, more than enough to accommodate guests’ cars.</p>
<p>The new hotel will be connected to the existing casino through an air-conditioned pedestrian sky bridge, ensuring seamless travel between the gambling facilities and the hotel rooms. The lobby, meanwhile, will cover an area of 4,800 square feet.</p>
<p>The hotel will also feature a restaurant with picturesque views of the locale. In addition to that, the property will have retail space, meeting and banquet areas, a full-service spa, a fitness center and a huge 11,000 square-feet rooftop pool deck with a bar and hot tubs.</p>
<p>JIVDC’s ambition is for the new hotel to achieve AAA’s Four Diamonds designation.</p>
<p>The Hotel Will Complement the Existing Casino</p>
<p>JIVDC hopes that its new property will complement the view and the casino experience. The hotel is designed with highly luxurious experiences in mind, as the corporation seeks to redefine gambling in the region.</p>
<p>The original Jamul Casino opened in 2016 and created 1,200 jobs in the region. The opening of the hotel is expected to create 125 new permanent jobs, as well as 1,000 constitution jobs. The new expansion comes in the wake of a $515 million loan JIVDC took to cover its debts and expand its property.</p>
<p>Erica Pinto, chair of Jamul Indian Village and chair of JIVDC’s board, said that the hotel will allow the tribal corporation to expand its market footprint. In addition, it will allow her team to create new jobs and increase funding for fire protection in San Diego County.</p>
<p>The economic impact of the hotel will have far-reaching and long-term positive effects on our tribal nation, state, and local economy. Erica Pinto, chair of Jamul Indian Village and chair of JIVDC’s board</p>
<p>Mary Cheeks, Jamul Casino’s president &amp; general manager also commented on the matter, saying that the hotel will make Jamul Casino more competitive, allowing it to stay relevant and surpass its competitors. Cheeks said that the luxurious facilities of the property are expected to cement the casino as an attractive leisure destination.</p>
