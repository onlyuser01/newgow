<p>After signing a partnership deal with Resorts World at the end of March and announcing an extended agreement with Playtech for Europe and the UK at the beginning of the month, multinational online payment company Paysafe has now started a collaboration with Strive Gaming.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s Software Will Be a Part of Strive Gaming’s PAMs</p>
<p>Paysafe believes the new deal with the supplier of player account management platforms (PAMs) will help it tackle the requirements for online operators in North America. Strive Gaming and Paysafe’s strong partner in the iGaming world Golden Nugget Online Gaming also announced a common agreement that is currently valid in Arizona and Ontario.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the newly announced partnership, Strive Gaming will benefit from Paysafe’s software by including it in its PAM platform. In turn, this will enable Golden Nugget Online Gaming players as well as clients from other North American and Canadian platforms to enjoy a richer array of choices in terms of classic and alternative payment solutions. The new payment options will be available via just one interface for extra convenience.</p>
<p>What Does Paysafe Have to Offer?</p>
<p>Paysafe will offer analytics tools and real-time reporting options to the PAM platform. These solutions will allow Strive Gaming’s clients to keep a closer eye on their transactions, enjoy higher levels of protection, and optimize their payment acceptance rates. Players will get to benefit from quicker and simpler depositing options via credit and debit cards using Paysafe’s popular payment gateway.</p>
<p>They will also be allowed to complete their payments using Skrill USA or cash alternatives such as Paysafecard and Paysafecash. Casino operators that will embrace the Strive Gaming PAM platform will provide customers with a full array of custom-made depositing and cashout solutions to match any needs.</p>
<p>Paysafe, Ready to Help Strive Gaming Grow Its Ties With Operators</p>
<p>Paysafe’s chief executive officer Zak Cutler expressed the company’s excitement for supporting Strive Gaming’s goal to create stronger ties between operators and their customers using their payment solutions. At the same time, the company is eager to keep growing the new partnership in the best interest of online gaming operators in North America.</p>
<p>At the same time, Strive Gaming’s chief executive officer Max Meltzer added the company turned into “a leading platform” in North America thanks to its quickly scalable and highly efficient technology. He also stated that powerful partnerships like the new deal with Paysafe represent “a hallmark” of their “tech stack”, and that the new deal will be to its customers’ liking.</p>
<p>Paysafe has over two decades of experience in the online payment field, more than 3,500 employees spread across 10 countries, and a yearly transactional volume that goes over the $120 billion mark.</p>
