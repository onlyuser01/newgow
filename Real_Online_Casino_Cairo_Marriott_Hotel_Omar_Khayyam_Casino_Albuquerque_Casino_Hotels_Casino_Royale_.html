    <h1>Real Online Casino Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayyam Casino Albuquerque Casino Hotels Casino Royale</h1>

<p>On this site they don't have any transaction history so I thought I made a deposit in December and I did but I guess my last deposit was 1211 and I won the tournament 1214 so of course they're not gonna pay me I talk to someone on chat I did copy the chat if you need that and I copy where I won the tournaments but they should already know who I am and that I did win and the reasons why they didn't pay or won't pay.</p>
<p>I hate these casinos in this is another one that makes the customer go through so much instead of having a positive experience they have a negative experience because they don't have clicks or safe holes or don't let you in or things that you shouldn't enter because you're not gonna be paid so I thought that because I'm entering the tournament that I'm good and then I guess in my own head because you can't click on your account to see your last transaction I knew I made a deposit towards the end of December so I knew I was good but as I said above, I made my last successful deposit 1211 of 23 and I won the tournament January 24, 2024 so a few days after I made my last deposit and of course they're not gonna pay it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's more comedy that we provide to them in the back room when they say that they don't have to pay out another tournament because idiot didn't make a deposit within 30 days just open the whole tournament to everybody and break cards every day because people think that they won and they should be paid like me for instance the $750 is not really funny to me</p>
<p>I will post the pictures from my phone. I'm on my computer and for some reason I can't get to them but I will add the pictures in our conversations later if need be, but I'm sure the argument is not that I want it's the timing and the fact that they let you play and when you win they just don't pay you I don't think that's fair. I think that they should pay me and then from now on don't let people play if they're close to or a little bit over the 30 days that's what I would like so I can have a more positive customer experience and be happy to play on their site again.</p>
