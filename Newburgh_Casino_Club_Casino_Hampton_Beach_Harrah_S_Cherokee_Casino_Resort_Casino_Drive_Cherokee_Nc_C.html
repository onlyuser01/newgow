<p>Sports betting revenue in New Hampshire has seen better days judging by figures released by the New Hampshire Lottery recently.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Lottery Releases Sports Betting Revenue Figures for December</p>
<p>The New Hampshire Lottery has announced the figures for sports betting revenue for December 2021. All in all, the sports betting handle in December 2021 hit $86.4 million. Compared to November 2021, an increase is observed considering that the sports betting handle back then halted at $83.2 million. However, the result in December still falls behind when compared to the sports betting handle from October 2021. Back then, sports fans wagered some $98.2 million. Despite the $86.4 million in sports betting handle, gross gaming revenue in December plummeted to $2.6 million. A month earlier, in November, GGR hit $6.2 million. In October, GGR halted at $5.4 million, which is still significantly more than the gross gaming revenue from December.</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, proceeds for the state’s coffers have also plummeted. In October, sportsbooks brought $2.6 million in tax revenue, while in November, tax revenue hit $2.9 million. In contrast, for December, the tax revenue hit only $1.1 million. This marked one of the lowest values recorded in the last 6 months, second only to August when tax revenue halted at $0.7 million. Breakdown of the $1.1 million in tax revenue shows that mobile sports betting contributed $1 million, while retail sports betting raised $82,408.</p>
<p>Mobile GGR Dips, Retail GGR Decreases</p>
<p>The latest report released by the New Hampshire Lottery reveals a breakdown of the $2.6 million in gross gaming revenue in December. It comes as no surprise that mobile sports betting contributed significantly by raising $2,446,400 in GGR. On the other hand, retail sports venues were responsible for raising only $198,534.</p>
<p>While mobile sports betting GGR in November hit $5.6 million, compared to the $2.4 million in December, a significant decrease is observed. Moreover, December’s GGR for mobile sports betting is down when compared to October as well, when GGR hit $4 million.</p>
<p>The result is similar when it comes to retail sports betting. Comparing the $198,534 in GGR raised in December to the $549,990 in GGR in November, a significant decrease is observed. Moreover, in October, retail sports betting GGR hit $1.4 million. However, considering that October was the first full month of NFL action, it doesn’t come as a surprise that retail sports betting GGR had skyrocketed.</p>
