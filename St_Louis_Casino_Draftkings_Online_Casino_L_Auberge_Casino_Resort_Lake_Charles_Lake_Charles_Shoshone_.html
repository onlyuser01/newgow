    <h1>St Louis Casino Draftkings Online Casino L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Lake Charles Shoshone</h1>

<p>Famous Canadian musician Drake lost another bet this weekend after his first ever Formula One wager went off the mark and incurred another dent in his betting armor.</p>
<p>First Time Not a Charm</p>
<p>Drake, who is being followed by 110 million people on Instagram, shared a screenshot of his first ever attempt to bet on an F1 competition, wagering CA$300,000 ($235,000) on Charles Leclerc and his Ferrari to win the Spanish Grand Prix. For his wagers, the rapper uses cryptocurrency betting operator Stake.</p>
<p>Leclerc was comfortably leading the Sunday’s Formula One race until the 27th lap in which a failure of the car’s engine forced him to retire from the race while also proving for Drake that he ‘Can’t Have Everything.’</p>
<p>Eventually, the Spanish GP in Barcelona was won by Max Verstappen driving for team Red Bull. The win was enough for Verstappen to leapfrog Leclerc in the overall standings and sit at the top only after six races.</p>
<p>Drake’s misfortunes stirred comments on social media after a number of his fans stated that The Drake’s Curse was real while another went further to suggest that Drake should be banned from betting on the F1.</p>
<p>Losing Streak Continues</p>
<p>Indeed, the Sunday loser was the latest in a series of lost bets for the four-time Grammy Award winner with the latest being the bet on the UFC 274 which took place in Phoenix, Arizona, earlier in May.</p>
<p>Drake placed a $427,000 bet on Justin Gaethje to win the fight against Charles Oliviera at the Footprint Center but was not fortunate to bank the million in winnings after Gaethje, who entered the match as the underdog, lost the fight.</p>
<p>Two months earlier, the famous Canadian rapper lost another huge wager on an event from the UFC, UFC 272 in Las Vegas, featuring Colby Covington vs. Jorge Masvidal. Drake placed $275,000 on Masvidal to win the fight against his former best friend not only to lose his money but to have salt rubbed in his wound from Covington after the match.</p>
<p>Commenting on Drake’s loser, Covington mocked the rapper, suggesting “he needs to go back to selling those s***y albums to get back the money” he had lost.</p>
