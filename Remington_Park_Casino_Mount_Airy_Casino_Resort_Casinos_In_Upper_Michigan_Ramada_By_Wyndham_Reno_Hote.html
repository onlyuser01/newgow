    <h1>Remington Park Casino Mount Airy Casino Resort Casinos In Upper Michigan Ramada By Wyndham Reno Hote</h1>

<p>Regulus Partners, a sports and leisure-oriented advisory company, has inked a strategic deal to acquire Global Betting &amp; Gaming Consultants (GBGC), an independent gambling consultancy.</p>
<p>Regulus Partners to Acquire GBGC</p>
<p>As per the agreement, GBGC will join the Regulus Partners family and will move all of its gambling-oriented data and reports to its new parent company. GBGC has two teams, one in the Isle of Man and one in Croatia. The two will now work alongside Regulus’ team to produce unparalleled gambling content and analysis.</p>
<p>Global Betting &amp; Gaming Consultants is an independent gambling consultancy, founded in 1998 and is headed by Warwick Bartlett, a seasoned veteran with more than 40 years in the industry. The firm has worked with some of the biggest names in the global gambling sector and has provided data to over 500 clients.</p>
<p>According to a statement by Regulus Partners, the two companies share a similar vision when it comes to helping gambling companies succeed on the highly-competitive betting market. It added that the addition of GBGC will strengthen Regulus’ offerings and help it to set the industry standard for reliable global gambling data and market analysis. GBGC’s data will be a valuable addition to Regulus’ advisory offerings.</p>
<p>The two parties didn’t openly disclose the financial terms of their deal.</p>
<p>Regulus Praises GBGC’s Expertise</p>
<p>It was added that GBGC will largely be allowed to maintain its leadership team, with Warwick Bartlett, the consultancy’s founder, now serving as a non-executive director. Bartlett shared that he is excited to join Regulus Partners and added that he believes the two companies will complement each other well and will offer superior content to clients and an increased value to shareholders.</p>
<p>“The clients of both our businesses will benefit tremendously from the additional services that will assist them in the management and expansion of their businesses,” Bartlett said.</p>
<p>Paul Leyland, co-founder of Regulus Partners, also spoke about the deal. He lauded GBGC’s database and team and called them “a great fit” for Regulus. Leyland praised the consultancy for always being as accurate and thorough as possible, despite the many uncertainties in the betting industry.</p>
<p>Leyland said that he trusts GBGC’s expertise and intends to invest in its team to ensure the development of a new market-leading product. He pointed out that the increasing scale and complexity of the gambling industry has ushered in a great night for supreme quality data – something he is sure GBGC can deliver.</p>
<p>Leyland concluded that he is delighted to welcome GBGC’s exceptional team to the Regulus family.</p>
