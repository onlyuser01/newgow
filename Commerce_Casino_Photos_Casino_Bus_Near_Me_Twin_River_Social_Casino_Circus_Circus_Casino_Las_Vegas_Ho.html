<p>Provider of player acquisition services for the global gaming industry Gambling.com Group announced today it has been granted a waiver to provide marketing services in Louisiana by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (LGCB).</p>
<p>Approved for Marketing Affiliate Operations</p>
<p>The announcement that Gambling.com will be eligible to provide affiliate marketing services in Louisiana came just ahead of the official launch of mobile sports betting on Friday, January 28, 2022. The waiver granted by the gambling regulator in the state followed the completion of Gambling.com’s application process.</p>
<p>Outlining the “tremendous amount of momentum” within the online gaming industry this year following the launch of mobile sports betting in New York and the upcoming launch in Louisiana, Gambling.com Group chief executive officer Charles Gillespie underlined the huge history in sports the state has.</p>
<p>“Louisiana has a rich sporting history – both professionally and collegiately – and our dedicated team of journalists, analysts and handicappers will give Louisiana sports fans the best chance to succeed in what will be one of the more exciting sports betting markets in the country.” Charles Gillespie, CEO, Gambling.com Group</p>
<p>Set to become the second state to launch online sports betting since the start of the year following the launch in New York on January 8, Louisiana will see 55 of its 64 parishes that approved the sports betting measure on the November 2020 referendum introduce online wagering on sports.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the news, Gambling.com vice president Caroline Smart highlighted the group’s position to establish a presence in the state, offering sports bettors expert picks, real-time odds comparisons, reviews of online sportsbooks and the latest news via its Gambling.com, Bookies.com and Rotowire.com websites.</p>
<p>“Louisiana allowing several sportsbooks to take legal sports bets in advance of the NFL conference championship games and the Super Bowl is a win for sports bettors in the state. With an open, free-market approach and a reasonable tax rate, sports betting operators will bring the best products and experiences to Louisiana.” Caroline Smart, VP, Gambling.com Group</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Roto Sports, the operator of Rotowire.com, last month in a cash plus stock deal valued at $27.5 million with the bulk of the cash payment set to take place at transaction close.</p>
<p>The acquisition was seen as the latest step of the company’s growth strategy in the US, seeking to further strengthen its position across gaming jurisdictions by leveraging Rotowire.com’s content library, workforce, partnerships and existing audience.</p>
