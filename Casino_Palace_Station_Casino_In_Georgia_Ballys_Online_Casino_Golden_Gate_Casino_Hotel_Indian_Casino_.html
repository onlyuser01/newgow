<p>The leading provider of online casino games, Play'n GO, announced a new European-facing partnership. On Wednesday this week, the company confirmed it joined forces with William Hill, agreeing to power the operator's offering in Italy. The European country represents a major online gambling market where William Hill has already established its footprint. Now, thanks to the collaboration, customers of the operator in Italy will tap into thrilling and quality games provided by Play'n GO.</p>
<p>Per the new agreement, William Hill's players in Italy gained access to the entire portfolio of games from the leading iGaming content supplier. As a result, new customers are going to benefit from Rise of Olympus, Book of Dead, as well as Reactoonz, among other quality games.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration in Italy builds upon the success of a previous business-to-business relationship between the two companies. Earlier this year, William Hill and Play'n GO announced an industry-first collaboration with the installment of the "Book of Dead" for William Hill FOBTs around the UK. This move brought benefits for the two companies that are now building on that success through their new collaboration in Italy.</p>
<p>Valerio Micchio, William Hill Italy's Head of Commercial, was thrilled about the deal with the provider of quality online games. In a statement, he explained: "We’re excited to add Play’n GO games to our portfolio, and view them as a natural partner to expand our presence in the region." Finally, Micchio said: "Our already-existing relationship points towards further success here in Italy, and we’re pleased to welcome a company who are as equally committed as we are to providing a safe, exciting experience to players everywhere."</p>
<p>Michele Stefanelli, Play'n GO's Sales Leader, LATAM and Southern Europe, shared the excitement of Micchio. He highlighted the importance of the Italian gambling sector for Play'n GO, explaining that the company is excited to continue its expansion in the country through the agreement with William Hill.</p>
<p>Moreover, Stefanelli praised the previous success of the two companies. "We’re committed to providing Italian players with the best online casino experience possible, and this partnership with William Hill is another big step in that direction," he added. "We’re confident that William Hill’s Italian players will love the opportunity to engage with our content, and we look forward to many years of success together," explained Stefanelli in conclusion.</p>
