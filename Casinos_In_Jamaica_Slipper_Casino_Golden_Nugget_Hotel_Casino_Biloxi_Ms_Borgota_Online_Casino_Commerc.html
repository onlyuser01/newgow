    <h1>Casinos In Jamaica Slipper Casino Golden Nugget Hotel Casino Biloxi Ms Borgota Online Casino Commerc</h1>

<p>So, today I would like to address all the haaaa???? Express situations in the Icecasino.</p>
<p>I have been registered since around February 23rd. The casino advertises daily bonuses that cannot be found anywhere else. And I think that's exactly why a certain category of people and such a mass of people keep returning there despite eternal frustration.</p>
<p>When I read the reviews here about ICE at the beginning, when it was still possible, I felt a shiver, for God's sake.</p>
<p>Obviously, no rational thinking person can avoid the idea that everything can go right with this evaluation story.</p>
<p>At this point I had my first withdrawal coming up and started to panic after studying the casino guru.</p>
<p>Who didn't have that?</p>
<p>Thousands of complaints, always the same dilemma. The same problems.</p>
<p>I don't need to mention them again, you just wait for your money like your best friend knows you're just paying for your funeral, it feels like war. You look for a few potatoes in hopelessness😂</p>
<p>Let me get to the point, I have had payouts in the small and medium 4-digit range three times so far. All of which, in terms of time spent and waiting time and requesting the same documents over and over again, etc., ultimately made you think.</p>
<p>Terrible. At some point they all arrived🥴 Yes, they pay out. Everything, and it takes time, if you have the nerve, everything is fine, that's all you need, time and nerves.</p>
<p>At some point then!!</p>
<p>I currently applied for €4500 on the 9th. First everything was rejected, again KYC even though it had been verified for a long time, flimsy new requests for selfies because of such a small amount for a casino of this size. 😑👁️👁️</p>
<p>Today is Friday the 13th. Well, I'll wait. The amount was divided into €400 and €200 partial transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday there were suddenly 3 of them being processed, i.e. €1000 out of €4500, and today suddenly there was another €800 being processed. The remaining approximately half of the total amount is still untouched in the balance.</p>
<p>Not a peep in the bank account yet.</p>
<p>So, I'll definitely keep you updated.</p>
<p>Insofar as I haven't died until I have the bills in my hand, sorry for my vulgar comment.</p>
<p>I'll take it out of my mind, we'll all pay in.</p>
<p>I'll come with an update, assured😘😘😘</p>
<p>Update: Today is October 20th</p>
<p>On October 10th I applied for €4500 to be paid out.</p>
<p>I canceled and lost €300.</p>
<p>Last week it was 1x400, 2 days later it was 400€ again and after the weekend this week I received 200€, a total of 1000€ received.</p>
<p>It's been 10 days since the application!!</p>
<p>I had a huge fanfare and endless dialogues with the chat.</p>
<p>You are always assured that you should wait and you won't be cheated.</p>
<p>Today is October 20th and this morning, even though the processing is supposedly already with the external provider, they simply canceled €800 (2 TRANSACTION ID s) and put it back on the balance to play with 👁️🧠🧠🧠😡😡😡I'm stinking angry. They keep saying, don't worry, with this amount a maximum of 5 working days, then the money will be available again with a 5-day waiting period from some external provider.</p>
<p>I accepted that too and waited!!!</p>
<p>My Mastercard was fine, it always went to this card.</p>
<p>Now they say technical problems again, and it's not our fault.</p>
<p>10 days have passed today.</p>
<p>€2000 is still missing.</p>
<p>The €800 that they simply, I call it strategically, credited back to my balance today, without any plausible and legitimate reason, has been available for payment for 8 working days, and they simply credit it back.</p>
<p>With this drama I have completely lost my trust in the payout policy of this casino.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this to your loyal customers?</p>
<p>I still get €2000.</p>
<p>Today is 8 working days!!!</p>
<p>You simply post money back to the balance that has been in the payout for 8 working days😡😡😡</p>
<p>Then you wait for help in the chat, help seems to be there, an employee seems to be trying hard.</p>
<p>After waiting for 25 mins, please wait, I will check. Does he actually say that he is sorry that I got into such a situation and that the payout can sometimes take longer than the maximum stipulated in the terms and conditions. 😡😡😡😱 Oh yeah 😂😂😂😂</p>
<p>Boy, I'm not here just before a hundred, no, completely different numbers. DAMNED</p>
<p>I want everyone here to know how sophisticated the process is here😰</p>
<p>I just want to finally have my €2000.</p>
<p>It's so damn disappointing.</p>
<p>I will report on Monday!!!</p>
<p>Every detail, I promise, ICECASINO</p>
<p>I wanted to advertise for you, I was so happy about my little win😰</p>
