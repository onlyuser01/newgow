<p>BetOnline is one of the leading sportsbooks in the world and the United States in particular. With a global outreach and a sports betting product that dates back to 2001, BetOnline.ag has created one of the most authentic betting experiences for modern bettors to enjoy. In our BetOnline Sportsbook review today, we will talk about the company behind one of the best betting agencies in the US as well as point out its advantages and drawbacks.</p>
<p>BetOnline offers a top-notch betting software, a large selection of markets and events to bet on, including all major American leagues, as well as early odds and lines to allow bettors to make timely and quick choices. While the sportsbook may still have a few rough edges to smooth out, BetOnline.ag remains a place where you can place a bet and expect to find opportunities to turn that bet into a success.</p>
<p>Origins of BetOnline.ag</p>
<p>The company behind BetOnline Sportsbook consists of a team that has worked together since 1991. It wasn’t until 2007, though, that the company chose to change its name and decided to position itself as a leading supplier of betting products in the United States. The first iteration of the sports betting product arrived in 2001, albeit under another name. After a rebranding a few years on, the company established itself as one of the leading online sportsbooks in the US, showing the way for others.</p>
<p>BetOnline.ag is licensed in Panama City, Panama, and accepts both players from the USA as well as worldwide. The sportsbook has recently introduced a few jurisdictions that have been excluded from the online sports betting offer, including New Jersey. The company coordinated this decision with the relevant authorities to ensure that it runs a legal and non-conflicting sports betting product.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the sports betting product, it’s worth mentioning that BetOnline runs a full-service casino as well as a card room. Their card room has one of the highest player bases in the world, offering unique opportunities to pursue yet another form of online gambling.</p>
<p>BetOnline FAQs</p>
<p>Is BetOnline Sportsbook legit? Yes, BetOnline Sportsbook is a legitimate operator licensed by the Republic of Panama Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Gaming Control Board. In essence, the sports betting site is licensed in Panama, and betting at BetOnline is the same as traveling to the country to bet in person. Can you participate in live betting at BetOnline? Yes, BetOnline offers comprehensive in-play and live betting markets. You can pick from multiple contests available under the relevant section of the website. Are there free bonuses at BetOnline.ag? Yes, BetOnline offers a risk-free wager worth $25. The wager will be reimbursed to you in full and up to $25 if you happen to fail your first bet at the sportsbook. Can you bet from your smartphone? Yes, BetOnline is praised for its ability to deliver a sterling mobile experience, allowing bettors to enjoy a versatile and convenient sports betting experience. Are US players allowed to play? In general, yes, all US citizens are allowed to participate at BetOnline. The only real drawback is that some states may have been excluded. Such states, including New Jersey, will be listed as “restricted” jurisdictions in BetOnline’s terms and conditions. What’s the maximum sum I can win from a free play bonus? The risk-free and play free bonuses offer you a maximum win up to $5,000 off the original bet sum, which is one of the best rates you will find at any sportsbooks today.</p>
<p>Banking Methods Offered by BetOnline</p>
<p>BetOnline Sportsbook offers a versatile choice of payment options, allowing players to pick from convenient banking methods. The website has some of the highest deposit limits and adequate withdrawal limits. You will find the sportsbook offering a variety of traditional and cryptocurrency payment options. For your cryptocurrencies, you can pick from several popular tokens, including:</p>
<p>Bitcoin</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash</p>
<p>Ethereum</p>
<p>Litecoin</p>
<p>Ripple</p>
<p>You will also have access to a range of traditional payment options, such as credit and debit cards and specifically Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover, as well as Person to Person, Money Order, Wire Transfer, and Cashier’s Check. The deposit limits are overly generous with cryptocurrencies allowing you to deposit as little as $20 and this amount increasing to $50 for bank cards.</p>
<p>All deposits are free and instant except in the cases of Cashier’s Check, Wire Transfer, Person to Person, and Money Order. For these payment methods, you may need to wait a little longer to see your BetOnline account charged, or be charged a fee. We recommend sticking to cryptocurrencies as the preferred payment method. BetOnline offers a very comprehensive guide on how to purchase Bitcoin, store it safely and use it for sports betting.</p>
<p>All cryptocurrency options allow you to bet up to $100,000 and Bank Wire comes with no limit. You can deposit as much as you feel comfortable with. For your withdrawals, all cryptocurrencies allow you to withdraw between $20 and $3000 instantly and without incurring additional fees.</p>
<p>However, requesting withdrawals in Wire Transfers, Person to Person, or Check by Courrier will incur various costs, ranging from a flat $45 fee and 3-4.5% of the total sum. Most sports bettors agree that cryptocurrencies offer the quickest and most beneficial banking methods and use them instead.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Banking: Quick and Reliable Withdrawals</p>
<p>In 2015, BetOnline.ag became one of the first sportsbooks to adopt Bitcoin as a way to offer a better experience to sports bettors who didn’t have access to their money as quickly and reliably as they wanted to. Therefore, BetOnline chose to pick a payment method that allowed instant deposits and very quick withdrawals which placed less financial burdens on sports bettors.</p>
<p>Admittedly, when the online sportsbook first introduced Bitcoin in 2015, the cryptocurrency commanded an unseemly 6.5% fee on deposits and a 2% fee on withdrawals. They removed both fees in August 2016 for deposits and January 2017 for withdrawals, giving their online sportsbook product a fresh boost, with bettors now able to get an even better value on their wagers.</p>
<p>Today, the withdrawals are capped at $3,000 per transaction making for a comfortable experience. Another great thing about this sportsbook is that the company allows you to place larger bets, up to $5,000, and more on individual sports contests.</p>
<p>There are other available methods to deposit with as well and they include QB-Direct, Moneygram, EcoPayz, Ria, Skrill, and Neteller. Please, keep in mind that any amount deposited via Skrill or Neteller will not activate a bonus found at BetOnline. It’s best to stick with an alternative payment option instead. Another thing to notice is that when you pick a Cashier Check, Money Orders, or Wire Transfer, a chat box will open for you to talk with BetOnline directly.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Markets with BetOnline.ag</p>
<p>The sportsbook has a comprehensive offer of betting options that diligently covers all mainstream competitions in sports, racing, and esports. There are estimated 30 different main sports categories you can bet on, including football, soccer, tennis, boxing, martial arts, basketball, baseball, hockey, golf, snooker, and a particular focus on all major American leagues, such as the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS, MLB, and others. The sportsbook covers an extensive range of betting opportunities that target US residents, but there are many alternatives such as Russian and Ukrainian table tennis, Japanese baseball, Australian and British horse racing, and many more viable alternatives to pick and choose from.</p>
<p>The sports betting product is further optimized to offer variety and a top crop of odds and lines. You will find multiple different options to bet, including straight bets, parlays, and various teasers and propositions. You can find a variety of traditional and value-added bets that allow you to leverage your knowledge of sports betting and turn it into successful wagers. More importantly, BetOnline.ag offers competitive odds and lines. The markets are usually announced 24-48 hours before an event, with some of the important and upcoming competitions released possibly days before the event starts.</p>
<p>Odds on soccer, tennis, golf, horse racing, NCAAB and NCAAF are usually released very early as the participating teams are known much sooner. Players will equally find multiple in-play or live betting options to pick from, enjoying a top-tier online sports betting experience as they go along. For different sports that require a special touch, BetOnline has introduced the necessary additional types of bets, such as puck lines for hockey and innings for baseball.</p>
<p>Running a comparison between BetOnline’s own fixtures and any other sportsbook, you will soon be convinced that the sportsbook runs and operates markets that are well-positioned against the competition to offer you value with every wager you place.</p>
<p>BetOnline Sportsbook Bonuses</p>
<p>BetOnline offers one of the most comprehensive varieties of sports betting bonuses, starting with a delightful $1000 welcome package as well as multiple reloads and free play betting options.

Please remember that these risk-free wagers apply to only your FIRST wager you make at the online sportsbook. Now, if you choose to go mobile, you will receive an even better offer, with a $50 risk-free wager on any sports contest bet on with a handheld device.</p>
<p>Once again, you will need to contact the BetOnline customer service to request a refund. Please note that you must ask for a refund within 24 hours whereas the bonus amount itself will arrive within 48 hours. The risk-free wagers are great fun and they are definitely one of the best features BetOnline.ag has to offer sports bettors. The maximum amount you can win from a risk-free wager is $5,000.</p>

<p>Weekly 20% Esports Rebate</p>
<p>Even though esports are a new addition to online sportsbooks, BetOnline has embraced it and there are already bonuses that apply for your esports wagers. The best one is the weekly rebate worth 20%, which means that EVERY WEEK you stand to get back 20% of your unsuccessful wagers back and have a new shot at various betting contests that focus on competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>Mobile Betting with BetOnline</p>
<p>Mobile betting is very popular at BetOnline. Thanks to the $50 Mobile Risk-Free Wager, you will have a great way to start. Most online sportsbooks will run some free bet as soon as you join, but only BetOnline will offer to reimburse you.</p>
<p>Outside of that, BetOnline is a mobile compatible sportsbook. Punters have praised the platform’s adequacy in creating a mobile-friendly user interface that allows both Android and iOS users to enjoy quick navigation and accurate markets. You can alter the experience any way you prefer and enjoy live betting, as well as watch live streams when available.</p>
<p>BetOnline makes the mobile betting experience immersive and helpful, offering full access to the banking section and promotions.</p>
<p>Betting Limits at BetOnline: Flexible and Fair</p>
<p>To offer bettors additional leeway, the website has decided to introduce a variety of opportunities to place a wager. you can start with wagers as small as $1 but you can quickly push up this number to $25,000 per single event. You may need to contact customer service first to confirm the origin of the money by submitting the relevant documents, but BetOnline allows “high rollers” to participate in betting contests. The only caveat here is that you may need to talk to customer service first before you know that your bet will be accepted.</p>
<p>The parlays will offer you a maximum payout of up to $150,000. Each event will have a specific maximum bonus by default. For example, for basketball and hockey parlays, the maximum bet is $250. These limits will naturally change and depend on what the current betting conditions are. In any eventuality, they will be displayed in a manner that is accessible and easy to read.</p>
<p>College basketball wagers will usually allow you to bet as much as $3,000 on spreads and for the NBA, you can bet as much as $10,000 $5,000 for money lines and totals respectively. BetOnline.ag will always let you pick from the most competitive options and assist you in placing a hefty bet where necessary. If you need further assistance with lifting a limit, get in touch with customer service.</p>
<p>BetOnline on Reddit: What Do Other People Think?</p>
<p>BetOnline has been brought up in Reddit discussions time and again by people who are keen on finding out more about the sportsbook. Without a fail, the opinions have been predominantly positive with the occasional suspicion that BetOnline.ag may be up to no good. Upon closer examination and response from other community managers, these allegations fell through.</p>
<p>The biggest issue cited by FIAT money holders is cash outs. It’s true that unless you use cryptocurrency, BetOnline will ask you to arm yourself with a little patience as most cashouts would take around five business days up to 14 business days to arrive. That may seem like a long-overdue cashout, but they are always honored and bettors can expect a quick response from customer service if they ever need to elaborate a point about the banking.</p>
<p>Conversely, bettors have confirmed that if you choose cryptocurrencies as your banking method, you will have a great time cashing out. While not every bettor seems privy to how Bitcoin actually works, BetOnline has gone out of its way to put together a comprehensive guide, recommending the safest crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>More Products by BetOnline: Racebook</p>
<p>Another worthwhile element of the offer is the racebook. No doubt, this place of the website is worth more than a mere mention. Horse racing is a very popular activity, and BetOnline covers the global betting market as any great sportsbook should. Since the nature of horse racing betting is slightly different, though, BetOnline has created a dedicated part of the site where you can follow international racing and bet on matchups, futures, and props, as well as read the website’s dedicate preview.</p>
<p>If you insist on a bonus before starting with horse racing, you will find this just as well, with the racebook offering some very tempting 7% horse rebate every week on unsuccessful wagers and a $25 risk-free bet for your first bet on any horse racing event. For those sports bettors who appreciate horse racing, the racebook is a real godsend, courtesy of BetOnline.</p>
<p>Online Poker at BetOnline – America’s Busiest Poker Room</p>
<p>Another huge part of the offer is the poker room. Once again, BetOnline Poker is subject to heated discussions on Reddit, and most of them testify to the quality of the product. Online poker is growing increasingly popular in the US, and players from all states, bar New Jersey as of the time of this review, are still playing at BetOnline. Of course, the card room is open for a global audience, too. It runs a dedicated bonus which offers to top your bankroll up to $1000 and make it possible to start with a great poker war chest. Not sure if it’s worth it, read our dedicated BetOnline poker review.</p>
<p>Live and Online Casino with BetOnline</p>
<p>Last, but hardly least we have the dedicated online casino available at BetOnline, which will offer you a chance to up the ante one more time and join another popular gaming vertical. The casino is equipped with close to 500 games which are a mix of live dealer games and popular casino options, such as slots, table games, and scratch cards. You will be happy to find out that the majority of online slot machines are actually HTML5-based, allowing iOS users to participate fully in the gaming experience.</p>
<p>For some versions of video poker and the live dealer games, however, you will need flash to run them, which some players see as a bit of a drawback, as it would cause trouble to iOS devices to connect with the casino. Nevertheless, you can expect the casino to be exactly where you want it to be in terms of functionality, bonuses, and other available options that make the overall experience far more satisfying to any player. If you fancy a go, you can check out our BetOnline Casino Review.</p>
<p>BetOnline.ag Customer Support</p>
<p>You may need help at BetOnline for a number of reasons. Finding a customer service agent is easy enough and you can use live chat, email, or even call. The most popular method is live chat as it offers the quickest turnaround. BetOnline customer support agents seem knowledgeable and helpful. They get in touch very quickly, although sometimes you may need to wait a bit longer to get a solution. There is a FAQ section and the Terms and Condition offer a lot of insight into what the sportsbook has to offer. You can look up betting limits, cashier limits, and more.</p>
<p>If you prefer and have time, you can send an email to BetOnline and troubleshoot potential issues that way. An email response would usually take a little longer, but a solution is always handy this way as well. If you prefer to email, just send a message to cs.betonline.ag and the customer support will get back to you. For the current phone numbers, please visit the customer support page.</p>
<p>Is BetOnline Rigged?</p>
<p>You cannot rig BetOnline for a number of reasons. First, BetOnline is one of the most visited sportsbooks in the US and in many parts of the world. That gives the brand a level of scrutiny that rivals that of regulators. As such, any rumors that some lines or odds have been rigged would get out too quickly for any sportsbook to contain. We have specifically looked into past transgressions. Now, there have been some profile disputes involving alleged cheating on the part of consumers for significant sums. However, the majority of those had been solved in favor of the bettors, consolidating BetOnline’s reputation as a fair sportsbook.</p>
<p>Another proof comes from the fact that the website acquired SportsBetting.ag, which was struggling at the time. Apart from revising the software and platform and updating those to BetOnline standards, the company found something else. The previous owners had not paid out bettors $1.5 million, money which BetOnline’s team now had to pay and did, giving SportsBetting.ag a flying start in the future. One last thing that guarantees the fairness and safety of BetOnline is their use of SSL encryption. There have been rumors that BetOnline may know your passwords, but this has not been confirmed and the use of SSL encryption guarantees that your information is safe.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If you are exclusively looking to bet on sporting contests, you will find BetOnline a brilliantly well-rounded betting agency. The variety of promotions and bonuses, combined with the platforms focus on the best player experience possible has produced promising results. Today, the available betting options at BetOnline exceed expectations by providing participants with competitive odds, early fixtures, and an ability to place a fair wager and expect it to be honored. Quick deposits are guaranteed, and even though there are a few caveats, such as some fees here and there, everything is available in a transparent method that allows you to make the best call in all circumstances.</p>
