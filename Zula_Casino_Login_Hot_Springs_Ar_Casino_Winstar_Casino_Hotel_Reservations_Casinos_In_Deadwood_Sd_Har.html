<p>GW CASINO</p>
<p>I won a total of up to $6000.00 over a period of 24 - 48 hours playing the highest balance was around $6000.00 and the lowest was $4000.00 and I requested a withdrawal at $4000.00</p>
<p>I contacted support twice before I even requested a withdrawal, and i had met the wagering requirements of the bonus terms very early in the period of time i was playing at GW Casino.</p>
<p>When i contacted support on the live chat (ON TWO SEPERATE OCCASSIONS) due to the fact that I couldnt believe i had won and I didnt want to get my hopes up incase it was a scam.</p>
<p>I asked them to confirm that the $4000 was withdrawable and I had infact won the money, They Confirmed. I asked them to confirm that there was no issues or breaches to any T&amp;C. Both times GW Casino Support went ahead and checked my account, and confirmed I could infact withdraw my winnings of $4000.00.</p>
<p>GW Casino Support then ran me through the process of withdrawing to my bank account and verification of my documents and account.</p>
<p>A few days later, after verifying my documents for the withdrawal.... I got this dreaded email..... After they had confirmed and checked my account.....when i asked them........ the following is an email thread......... between GW casino support and myself...</p>

<p>Hello Jessica,</p>
<p>We have received your withdrawal request. However, it has been denied by our Audit Team.</p>
<p>Please be advised that during the verification of your withdrawal, they have noticed that our Bonus Terms and Conditions were breached.</p>
<p>Please be reminded that:</p>
<p>"13. Players are allowed to place single bets lower than 20% of the total value of the Active Bonus credited and should not exceed 8 EUR, 8 USD, 8AUD, 8CAD, 80 SEK, 80 NOK (as applicable). Therefore, placing a bet of 8 EUR while thereâ€™s an Active Bonus of 100 EUR in effect is considered acceptable practice."</p>
<p>Upon checking, on the 14th of December, you made a deposit of $60 and claimed a deposit bonus of $30, therefore the maximum bet allowed should be less than $6.</p>
<p>Our Audit team found bet/s of $10, $20, $40 and $60 while the bonus was active which clearly breach our Bonus Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
<p>All your winnings have been voided accordingly and your deposit of $60 has been returned to your balance.</p>
<p>Please find time to also visit our Bonus and General Terms &amp; Conditions to avoid any inconvenience in the future.</p>
