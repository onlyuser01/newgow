<p>Pariplay, a subsidiary of NeoGames SA, has added yet another developer of iGaming and online casino content to its Fusion platform, an aggregation solution designed to quickly inject content and boost the gaming variety each partner operator can offer back to its players.</p>
<p>Pariplay Moves Forward with Even More Content</p>
<p>Moving forward, Pariplay will offer Everi Digital titles, the online gaming business developed by Everi Holdings Inc, which is in turn a company focusing on building land-based and digital casino content and products, along with player loyalty solutions, financial technology, and more.</p>
<p>As a result, Pariplay will strengthen its Fusion platform with more than 60 titles developed by Everi Digital. The titles will be available on Everi’s Spark Remote Game Server, or Spark RGS for short, which is designed to make sure that Fusion will be able to share these titles in a seamless and efficient way with audiences globally.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Fusion platform already features an impressive 14,000 games from more than 80 suppliers, and the company makes sure to offer full back-office support. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris has welcomed the opportunity and said that the company was constantly looking to increase its presence and bolster the content variety it brings to partner operators through the Fusion platform. Harris said:</p>
<p>Our operator clients will now benefit from a wide range of titles that have been crafted with a real attention to detail, creating engaging and entertaining experiences that can be enjoyed by players all over the world through our Fusion platform. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris</p>
<p>The partnership was also welcomed by EVP of sales, marketing and digital at Everi, David Lucchese. Luchese added that Pariplay’s aggregation capabilities have been long proven in the industry and that the company was keen to expand its own reach.</p>
<p>He assured that the Spark RGS would no doubt be a contributing part in that expansion and that new audiences and operators will have the opportunity to benefit from quality products developed by Everi Digital.</p>
<p>Pariplay Continues to Build Up Fusion Platform</p>
<p>Pariplay has been actively adding more top-of-the-range suppliers to its aggregation platform over the past months. In October alone, the company secured Live Solutions and Kalamba Games as partners.</p>
<p>Pariplay also continued with its efforts to launch in new markets in October in a bid to be able to bring its aggregated and proprietary content to more audiences. Early last month, the company confirmed that it has been cleared for a supplier license in Connecticut in the United States.</p>
