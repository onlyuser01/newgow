    <h1>Prairie Winds Casino Hotel Robinson Rancheria Casino Divi Flamingo Beach Resort Casino Louisiana Cas</h1>

<p>Instant Win Gaming (IWG) is deploying its outstanding variety of eInstant games to the Kentucky Lottery Corporation, following successful integrations in the past</p>
<p>Previously, the Kentucky Lottery introduced International Game Technology’s iLottery Platform and Instant Remote Game Server solutions to empower the lottery and provide its players with a greater variety of products and options.</p>
<p>Boosting Kentucky Lottery’s Library of Games with eInstants</p>
<p>The latest addition of eInstant Games builds on the existing tie-up between IWG and IGT with the Kentucky Lottery. Players will have the opportunity to explore a number of fresh eInstant games and build upon the library of such titles already supplied by IGT.</p>
<p>IWG has some excellent titles to offer as well, including Cash Expander, and the version of the game that has been specifically branded for the Kentucky Lottery, the Kentucky Cash Drop.</p>
<p>IWG’s integration of the Instant RGS and IGT’s dedicated iLottery platform has been accomplished within a four-month window, making it one of the quickest deployments of this kind. IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher has welcomed this new opportunity and said that it was a great feeling to be able to relaunch the eInstant titles in the state once again.</p>
<p>The fact that the company can strengthen the lottery’s Instant Play offering is a welcome fact. Fisher added:</p>
<p>With our dozens of lottery integrations previously completed, the project between ourselves, IGT and the Kentucky Lottery went smoothly as expected; less than four months from IGT and IWG signing a contract to go-live. IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher</p>
<p>The chief executive also explained that IWG was prepared to support the lottery in its future operations and supply the type of games that players would appreciate. Kentucky Lottery Corporation CEO and president Mary Harville was similarly excited to see eInstant games by IWG now become a part of the lottery’s offer.</p>
<p>Ensuring the Future of the Lottery’s Operations</p>
<p>“They will undoubtedly complement our existing Instant Play lineup and provide our players with new experiences to enjoy,” Harville explained. Lotteries are looking to quickly improve their overall product offerings in a bid to catch up to the variety of iGaming options that are increasingly available in the land-based and oftentimes the digital sector.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Lottery Corporation’s decision to strengthen its presence in interactive gaming products with IGT and IWG is a step in the right direction.</p>
