<p>The leading gaming and entertainment company, The Cordish Companies, announced that its affiliate, LRGC Gaming Investors, LLC, started the construction of the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana, a new premium gaming, dining, hotel and entertainment destination. The groundbreaking ceremony took place earlier this week, marking the commencement of the construction of the project with a price tag of above $270 million.</p>
<p>Louisiana State Senator Barrow Peacock, Bossier City Mayor Thomas Chandler, State Representative Sam L. Jenkins, Jr. and Louisiana Gaming Control Board Chairman Ronnie Johns, attended the groundbreaking ceremony which was hosted by The Cordish Companies Principal Jon Cordish. Further visitors who attended the recent event included representatives of the tourism industry, businesses along dozens of regional elected officials.</p>
<p>Scheduled to open in 2025, the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana uses the site where Diamond Jacks Casino &amp; Hotel in Bossier City used to be located. The location is perfect, considering it is positioned some 40 miles from the Arkansas border and 20 miles from the Texas border, allowing out-of-state visitors easy access. Moreover, the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana is near Interstate 20 and Highway 71, offering convenient access for visitors from nearby and far away.</p>
<p>Once the new casino and entertainment location opens its doors, visitors can expect more than 1,000 slots and electronic table games, along with more than 40 live-action table games, positioned within a luxury 47,000+ square feet of gaming space. Additional gaming amenities include a sportsbook.</p>
<p>Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana is expected to offer luxury hotel accommodations with its 550 rooms, a fitness center as well as a resort pool. Further amenities the new gaming and entertainment destination is expected to offer include an Event Center, surface and structured parking, as well as world-class dining venues, different food and beverage outlets and fine dining options.</p>
<p>Jon Cordish, Chairman of The Cordish Companies, commented on the topic in a statement. "Today marks an incredibly special day for my family and The Cordish Companies as we continue to expand our Live! brand in the Southeast region of the country with the development of Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana," he explained. Additionally, Cordish said: "With the first land-based casino in the market, Live! Casino will be a transformative development that will bring a first-class gaming and entertainment experience to millions of visitors, create significant new jobs, and generate millions of dollars in economic benefits for the community for generations to come."</p>
<p>The City of Bossier is expected to benefit from some $35 million in gaming tax for the first five years of the operation of the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana. Moreover, for the same period, the premium gaming and entertainment location is expected to bring some $168 million in gaming tax for Louisiana.</p>
<p>Besides taxes, the new casino resort would create some 750 construction jobs. Once finished, the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Louisiana is expected to offer 750 permanent workplaces, providing jobs for local communities and helping businesses in the region to grow.</p>
