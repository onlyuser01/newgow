<p>Efforts aimed at strict regulation of POGOs in the Philippines continue with a new proposal that calls for the creation of designated areas for such businesses</p>
<p>Much has been said about the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) recently and a proposal last month even called to end those activities. This came in light of allegations about crimes related to POGOs and calls for tough regulation if those operators are allowed to continue to operate.</p>
<p>Now, the chairman of the Senate Public Order and Dangerous Drugs Committee, Senator Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, made a new, slightly different proposal, the Manila Bulletin revealed. The Senator was interviewed via Zoom recently and hinted that POGOs shouldn’t be shut down immediately.</p>
<p>Instead, Senator Dela Rosa showed support for a gradual shutdown of those operations and their restriction to dedicated areas. He said that the gradual shutdown of those operators can be done over the course of two or three years. More importantly, Dela Rosa proposed POGOs be allowed to operate within designated areas or zones.</p>
<p>Strict Government Scrutiny to Reduce Crimes</p>
<p>This, according to the Senator, is expected to help in the fight against crimes related to POGOs. Allowing the operators to conduct business within a controlled zone, Dela Rosa said, will enable the government to “strictly supervise their operations and avoid the occurrence of crimes.”</p>
<p>There are currently POGO operators within different locations such as the Luzon area. POGOs are also present in Cave, Tarlac, Paranaque, Pasay, Pampanga, as well as Cagayan, explained the Senator. Given that the new proposal is accepted, POGOs would operate in specific zones, similar to the economic ones.</p>
<p>But the strict supervision of the government will seek to limit crimes such as illegal firearms possession, murders or kidnappings. The proposal will be up for debate. Ultimately, lawmakers will have to decide whether or not it will go forward following the recommendation of the two Senate committees.</p>
<p>“The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation would like to reiterate its firm commitment to uphold the integrity of the gaming industry in the Philippines, including offshore gaming.“ Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation</p>
<p>Recently, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, PAGCOR, reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring the integrity of the gambling sector in the Philippines. This includes the offshore gaming segment, explained the Corporation. Consequently, PAGCOR said that it has started the process of hiring a third-party independent auditor. Ultimately, the auditor will help by “independently and accurately conducting verification of the offshore gaming licensees’ gross gaming revenues.”</p>
