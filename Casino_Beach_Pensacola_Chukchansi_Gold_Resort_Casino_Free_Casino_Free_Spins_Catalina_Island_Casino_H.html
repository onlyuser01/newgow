<p>Offensive Problems for New Orleans Saints</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are 2-4 in the 2022 season, and their defense is to blame. With 158 points conceded, they’re among the worst teams defense-wise in the conference.</p>
<p>It’s kind of surprising that their offense has been better than their defense, considering that New Orleans’ first-choice QB Jameis Winston has been struggling with fitness. His replacement, Andy Dalton, however, has done a surprisingly good job.</p>
<p>The result is that the Saints now have 141 points on their tally, which makes their scoring average of 23.5 PPG one of the best in the NFC.</p>
<p>DeAndre Hopkins is Finally Back</p>
<p>After testing positive for performance-enhancing substances, Arizona’s best wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was served a six-game suspension by the NFL.</p>
<p>Without him on the field, his team managed to score only 114 points in the first six games of the 2022 season, with their worst offensive performance being the one in the Week 6 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which saw the Cardinals score just nine points. The good news is that the wait is over – Hopkins is coming back in Week 7.</p>
<p>With him on the team, the Cardinals just have to do better in the offense. It seems that an elite receiver was what’s been missing in Arizona, whose quarterback Kyler Murray has been doing an okay job despite the poor stats. With Hopkins on the receiving end, Murrey is guaranteed to do much better passing-wise.</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints vs Arizona Cardinals Prediction</p>
<p>The time has come for Arizona’s first home win of the season. With Hopkins back on the team, they’re bound to do much better offensively. Their defense too should have a good night on Thursday, as they definitely look capable of taming the Saints regardless of who they put in the role of the QB.</p>
<p>Picks: Arizona Cardinals to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
