<p>Drops and Multipliers. When a winning combination is seen popping on the grid, all the symbols part of it will burst in an explosion, and fresh symbols will cascade in the free positions of the reels.</p>
<p>This attracts extra opportunities for hitting even more winning combinations during a single round. All wins in the respective game are amplified by an active multiplier shown above the reels. During the main game, the multipliers range from x1, x2, x3, and x5.</p>
<p>Wild Symbol. This symbol replaces the rest of the symbols when a winning combination is generated, except for the scatter symbol that can only pop up on the second, third, and fourth reels.</p>
<p>Scatter Symbols. When a minimum of three Scatter symbols are seen anywhere on the reels, they automatically engage the Free Spins feature. These symbols can only appear on the first, third, and fifth reels.</p>
<p>Three types of Free Spins. Players are given the chance to take their pick from three available types of Free Spins. The first option is 18 Free Spins featuring multipliers of x2, x4, x6, and x10.</p>
<p>The second variant is the 12 Free Spins featuring multipliers ranging from x3, x6, x9, and x15. The third option is the 6 Free Spins featuring multipliers of x6, x12, x18, and x30.</p>
<p>When three Scatter symbols show up during any of the three Free Spins rounds, the feature is triggered once again, giving players more chances to increase their wins.</p>
<p>Bonus Buy Feature. Players are given the opportunity to use this feature to buy any type of the three Free Spins rounds.</p>
<p>Evoplay’s Endless Summer Network Tournament with a $130,000 prize pool that started in June will end on August 22.</p>
