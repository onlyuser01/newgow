    <h1>Seven Cedars Casino Ojibwa Casino Parkwest Bicycle Casino Riverside Casino And Golf Resort Iowa City</h1>

<p>Dear Sir, Madam,</p>
<p>I decided to deposit 200EUR yesterday, Nov. 16 and played till Nov 17 morning. I accumulated 17870EUR winnings only in Live Casino.</p>
<p>I did a withdrawal of 10015EUR (because of a 15EUR fee for withdrawal) which one was cancelled by the casino. After that, they also cancelled my 7870EUR remaining balance because they don't accept winnings more than 10000EUR and withdrawal limit is 10000EUR per month.</p>
<p>I requested a 10000EUR cash out, which was approved.</p>
<p>I ask the casino to REFUND my remaining balance (7870EUR). Indeed, they cancelled my winnings with no reason. It is completely illegal and that's called a theft. I understand that the cash out limit per month is 10000EUR BUT I cannot accept that they kept my remaining winnings.</p>
<p>I took the risk to lose all my balance, fortunately, luck was with me and I went up to 17870EUR. I want to point the lack of clarity in the terms of this casino. If we cannot win more than 10000EUR, why do they let players play above 10000EUR and let them take the risk to lose all the balance if it is impossible to cash out more than 10000EUR? Also, as I'm a high roller player, it happens that I deposit a lot of money, what's the goal if I deposit 10000EUR? Is it impossible to win on this casino? This is a complete NONSENSE. They have to let the balance and let the possibility to withdraw the next month.</p>
<p>All the reviews website mention the monthly limit and as I said, I don't have any problems with the monthly limit withdrawal. If they decide to put a limit on winnings, they HAS to prevent the players when they reach the limit. Again, I played above 10000EUR, this is a complete NONSENSE.</p>
<p>In attach, you can find my winnings from both days.</p>
<p>I ask the casino to REFUND the remaining balance (7870EUR) with no delays.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Tristan H<strong><em> (ID: t</em></strong>e)</p>
