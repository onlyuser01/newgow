<p>A-Leagues commissioner Nick Garcia promised fans more soccer, more goals and more stories to connect with</p>
<p>Global sports &amp; culture company IMG has extended its exclusive international media, data and streaming rights partnership agreement with the Australian Professional Leagues (APL). Under the extended partnership, IMG will distribute APL media rights for several more years.</p>
<p>The partnership extension will allow the sports specialist to manage APL’s media rights in international markets, excluding Australia and New Zealand. At the same time, IMG’s IMG ARENA brand will record and provide official data from all APL matches over, supplying it to its extensive network of partnering sports betting operators.</p>
<p>The renewed contract covers both ALP’s men’s and women’s teams, allowing the APL to grow its presence. The league explained that the partnership with IMG will help it “drive audience and commercial growth” for some of the most highly-anticipated events of the seasons.</p>
<p>More Soccer, More Goals and More Stories for Fans</p>
<p>A-Leagues commissioner Nick Garcia commented on the extension of APL’s partnership with IMG, highlighting its potential to promote Australian and New Zealander soccer. Garcia said that his team is looking forward to continuing the partnership with IMG, tapping into the global sports company’s extensive expertise in sports and benefitting from its expansive global network.</p>
<p>Garcia added that the A-Leagues are home to a variety of international soccer talents. He noted:</p>
<p>With three new women’s teams in the A-League Women, and two men’s teams to come to the A-League Men, we have more football, more goals, and more stories for fans to connect with. Nick Garcia, commissioner, A-Leagues</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dale Levin, senior vice president and head of Australasia and Southeast Asia for IMG’s media business, also commented on the matter. He said that his team is very proud of its lasting relationship with the Australian Professional Leagues. According to Levin, the partnership has allowed the leagues to grow significantly over the past six years.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, IMG ARENA expanded its partnership with Major League Soccer, agreeing to supply tracking data for MLS Next Pro, a major soccer league in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In April, IMG ARENA also wrapped up its acquisition of the high-end virtual games provider Leap Gaming. The deal was officially announced in December 2022 and allows IMG ARENA to enhance its offering. IMG ARENA president Freddie Longe remarked that the acquisition will allow his company to “shape the future of sports betting entertainment.”</p>
