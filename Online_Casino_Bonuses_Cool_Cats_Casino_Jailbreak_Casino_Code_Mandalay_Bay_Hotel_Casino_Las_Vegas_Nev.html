<p>Raging Rex 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Raging Rex 2 is a dinosaur-themed slot starring the iconic T-rex.</p>
<p>Players will travel far back in time and find themselves in a steamy prehistoric jungle. As huge dragonflies buzz past, they’ll discover a variety of majestic dinosaurs who are both cute and fierce.</p>
<p>Fans of the Jurrassic Park franchise will immediately love this slot, as will anyone who secretly longs to meet a dinosaur.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack adds suspense and a touch of whimsy with dramatic notes bringing to mind the lumbering steps of giant dinosaurs. When players hit spin they’ll hear the sound of pebbles, adding to the natural feel of the setting.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels is dense with greenery such as ferns and palm-like trees. Large dragonflies fly both in front of the reels and behind them, giving an immersive feeling to the main game area.</p>
<p>The dinosaurs are drawn with attractive realism, and even the ferocious individuals look somewhat cute. Players may understandably ponder whether they could befriend one of the prehistoric giants.</p>
<p>Big win in the Raging Rex 2 slot machine</p>
<p>The T-rex symbols are striking with the legendary predator leaning right out of his reel, eyes glinting. His gaze leaves no doubt that he’s a hunter to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a captivating prehistoric world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Raging Rex 2 is a six reel, four row slot.</p>

<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol comes in two forms: the Rex Wild takes up the full heigh of the reel while the Hatchling Wild is the size of a standard symbol taking up only one position on the reels. Both Wilds substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbols.</p>
<p>Players trigger the Re-Spins feature when a Rex Wild symbol lands. Depending on the reel that the Rex Wild lands on, they’ll be awarded up to 5 spins.</p>
<p>Stacked Wild symbol triggers the Re-spin feature</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins when players land at least 3 Scatter symbols. The number of free spins awarded to the player is decided by the number of Scatters that trigger the feature as well as the version of the feature the players opt to play.</p>
<p>When starting the Free Spins feature, players have the option to choose from three versions of the feature. Each incarnation comes with a certain number of free spins in combination with special features such as sticky symbols and potential multipliers.</p>
<p>Player has to pick which free spins will play out</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.2%, slightly above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high-medium, which makes it a reasonable, though not perfect, match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for the high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this slightly high RTP, high-medium volatility dinosaur-themed slot.</p>
<p>The engaging animation of the dinosaurs as well as the respectable RTP and volatility make Raging Rex 2 well worth checking out.</p>
<p>The range of bonus options give this slot further depth and ensure that the gameplay holds players’ attention.</p>
