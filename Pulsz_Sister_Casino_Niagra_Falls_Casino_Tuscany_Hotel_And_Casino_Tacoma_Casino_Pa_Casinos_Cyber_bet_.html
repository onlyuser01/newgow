    <h1>Pulsz Sister Casino Niagra Falls Casino Tuscany Hotel And Casino Tacoma Casino Pa Casinos Cyber bet</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm writing to express my disappointment with the casino, which is insisting that I comply with numerous turnovers. This feels like a monumental scam, and I can clearly see why there are so many complaints about this casino. They initially rejected my withdrawal request on the grounds that I needed to supply an additional document to verify my address - which I understood and complied with, uploading my document to the casino's website. It was completely verified and I was able to make a withdrawal four days later. I thought that I wouldn't have anymore trouble playing and withdrawing, and so I made a deposit of 100,000 CLP with an active bonus. Unfortunately, this didn't go well, and I lost my money as well as my bonus balance, ultimately leaving me with a single peso. Initially, I was told that the bonus was automatically eliminated, and after double-checking, it seemed this was indeed the case and there were no turnovers left to comply with. Subsequently, I made another deposit of 10,000 CLP, this time without accepting a bonus, and just played freely. With this 10,000 CLP, I managed to win 530,000 CLP. I received an immediate notification that my withdrawal of 530,000 CLP was being processed. I assumed that, because I had no turnovers left to comply with, it would be fairly smooth sailing from here on out. If there were any turnovers outstanding, my withdrawal would not even have been accepted, let alone processed. However, the very next day, I received an email saying that my withdrawal had been rejected. I read through the four potential reasons they provided, but none of them applied to me. When I tried to initiate the withdrawal again, to my shock and disappointment, they claimed I had new turnovers to comply with. I see no other name for this practice but 'scam'. I played all the time without an active bonus, and my deposit history clearly confirms this: all deposits can be seen in my bonus history, under the 'no bonus' section. No wonder there are so many complaints against this casino, as they won't even let you withdraw peacefully. They don't want to lose a thing. I have all the proof that may be necessary. I am really having a hard time dealing with all this.</p>
