    <h1>Platinum Casino Kwataqnuk Resort Casino Casinos Nearby Casino Apps Real Money 888 Casino Bonus AGA s</h1>

<p>The American Gaming Association has been keeping an eye on the hype for the FIFA World Cup 2022 and now, it appears that at least 8% of the American adult population or some 20.5m are going to be placing a wager on the upcoming event. The event is going to generate an expected total betting handle of $1.8bn the association says, and there is sufficient interest in it.</p>
<p>The number of bettors is actually much smaller than the 46.6m who are betting on the National Football League season, but it definitely points to a cultural understanding of the importance of football (or soccer in this case) in the United States. AGA h as been able to provide a good breakdown of what it expects from World Cup bettors, as it has with previous events and sports.</p>
<p>According to AGA, 48% of bettors will be placing a bet online, or some 9.8m people. 29% of bettors, or 6m people, will be placing a casual bet with a friend. Some 23% of all bettors or 4.7m will place a bet at a retail sportsbook. Another 20% or 4.1m people will place a bet with a bookie, and 3.5m people or 17% will place a bet with a paid pool or as part of a fantasy contest.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 78% of all interviewed bettors said that it was important for them to place their wagers with authorized sportsbooks and legally. This means that there is a growing public awareness about regulated and unregulated gambling sites and markets, with an overwhelming majority of people now actively seeking out the licensed options.</p>
<p>AGA SVP Casey Clark said that more than half of American adults now had access to legal betting options, and that interest in sports wagering as a whole is increasing in the country. Clark added:</p>
<p>"As the first World Cup with widespread availability of legal sports betting, this will certainly be the most bet-upon soccer event ever in the US."</p>
<p>The association provided additional breakdown saying that Gen Z and Millennial were among the most interested bettors. Gen X were third and Baby Boomers brought up the rear. Clark reminded that people who participate in World Cup betting should do so responsibly, echoing the Have A Game Plan campaign spearheaded by the association.</p>
<p>Clark urged bettors to set a budget, learn about odds, play with regulated operators, and have fun.</p>
