<p>Foxx added a promotional photo where he is sitting on a golden MGM-branded race car. The author of the photo, Erik Umphery, commented on the post, saying that working with Foxx has been a delight.</p>
<p>Foxx serves as a brand ambassador to the gambling giant and has previously collaborated with the operator on multiple occasions. He joined BetMGM back in 2020 and has supported the company since.</p>
<p>Foxx Was Hospitalized Because of Health Complications</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the actor has to be hospitalized earlier this year after unspecified health complications. While the star did not disclose the exact nature of his health problem, he said that he went ‚Äúthrough hell and back‚Äù on his road to recovery.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement, Foxx‚Äôs daughter, Corinne Foxx, said that, luckily, quick action and great care enabled her father to recover quickly.</p>
<p>In an earlier video, Foxx himself commented on the condition he went through. He disproved the rumors that he was blind and paralyzed by showing that he is still moving just fine and by crossing his eyes to show that they are working.</p>
<p>Foxx admitted that he remained secretive about his condition because he did not want fans to see him in the hospital with tubes coming out of him. Instead, he prefers fans always seeing his cheerful side and watching him acting and having a good time.</p>
<p>The actor thanked his daughter and all the skilled hospital workers who enabled him to recover quickly. He also thanked all of the fans who remained supportive of him during this difficult period.</p>
<p>Fans were delighted to hear that Foxx is now better with many praising him on his recovery. He was flooded with positive messages on both Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>BetMGM and Foxx will likely release more news on their partnership in the near future.</p>
