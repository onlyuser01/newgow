<p>BF Games, an acclaimed creative developer of games for the iGaming sector, has become the latest company to pursue expansion beyond the confines of traditional gaming, with the company announcing its dedicated BF HUB aggregation platform.</p>
<p>BF HUB will serve as a springboard for partner studios who wish to have their products delivered to new operators quickly and efficiently, and also assist suppliers in debuting and roll out their products across regulated markets. BF HUB already has a new partner, and its first partner as a matter of fact, with the innovative and up-and-coming Tornado Games becoming the first supplier to enter into collaboration with BF HUB.</p>
<p>BF HUB is coming at a time when the industry has been laser-focused on aggregation opportunities with Relax, EveryMatrix, and REEVO all pursuing similar opportunities. Meanwhile, Tornado Games is deploying 16 of its own games amongst which Dragon’s Book, Buffalo Nights Hold ‘n’ Spin, and Party Birdies, among others. BF Games also teamed up with REEVO earlier this year to join the company’s aggregation solution and boost its own reach as a supplier.</p>
<p>BF Games also has more than 80 slot games to offer both through direct content injections and now as part of its newly set-up BF HUB. BF Games Head of Account Management Rok Hribar was similarly pleased with this opportunity and said that BF HUB is an opportunity to significantly grow the BF Games’ brand name and present new opportunities to operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>"After more than a decade in the industry, we look forward to using our expertise and industry know-how to help new slot providers secure their first partnerships, including Tornado Games, who we have no doubt will enjoy huge success," Hribar added.</p>
<p>Tornado Games Head of Sales Thaluana Muscat was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this partnership through, arguing that the addition of BF Games as a partner would have a significant role in the company’s further expansion and reaching new milestones.</p>
<p>"This partnership with BF Games allows us to do just that. The game provider has been busy in recent months, entering new markets and signing plenty of operator deals," Muscat added, arguing that Tornado Games will be able to grow and expand its offer at a good pace moving forward.</p>
