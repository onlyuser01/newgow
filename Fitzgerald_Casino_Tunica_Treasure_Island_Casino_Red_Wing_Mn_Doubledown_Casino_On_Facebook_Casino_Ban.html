<p>International Game Technology (IGT), a global leader in gaming technology and slot machines, has extended its agreement with Loto-Québec, expanding its footprint in Canada. The renewed deal is set to expire in 2027.</p>
<p>IGT to Continue Supplying Loto-Québec</p>
<p>Under the new deal, IGT’s Canadian subsidiary, IGT Canada Solutions, will continue to supply Loto-Québec with gaming technology. In addition, the supplier agreed to power the Canadian lottery operator with an enhanced version of its INTELLIGEN video lottery central system software. The agreement notably also includes all related components.</p>
<p>As announced by the provider, the newer version of the INTELLIGEN network includes much better diagnostics and data analytics. The systems within the network are deployed across the globe and currently connect thousands of video lottery terminals (VLT) across various gaming environments. The software is backed by the robust experience of IGT’s team, ensuring the stability and control that operators need.</p>
<p>The ITELLIGEN Netwok supports the Gaming Standards Association’s Game to System standard protocol and allows the use of improved UI, cashless payments, better safer gaming tools and thrilling jackpot offerings, among other tools.</p>
<p>Per the extended deal, IGT will also leverage its European Operational Center to provide Loto-Québec with all the operational support needed from the system. IGT will also provide Loto-Québec with more VLTs gaming cabinets, all equipped with many best-in-class games, including PlayDigital titles.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Have a History of Working Together</p>
<p>Loto-Québec and IGT have a long history of working together. The two parties first joined forces in 1978 and have been collaborating ever since. Nick Khin, chief operating officer of gaming at IGT, spoke about the extended partnership. He is sure that the INTELLIGEN system will position Loto-Québec for more success in the future. In addition, he promised that IGT will provide the lottery with the best state-of-the-art updates it has to offer.</p>
<p>Over the years, IGT has cemented itself as an undisputed leader in global gaming. The company is famous for supplying companies with exciting experiences for players across all gaming verticals, including lotteries, slot machine operators and sportsbooks. The supplier provides solutions for both retail and online operators and offers a rich selection of content and gaming tools. IGT products make sure that the company’s clients are always in charge of their offerings.</p>
<p>Speaking of IGT, several days ago, the company posted its Q3 results, highlighting its continuously growing presence in the global gaming sector. During the quarter, the company earned over a billion dollars, marking an 8% year-on-year increase.</p>
