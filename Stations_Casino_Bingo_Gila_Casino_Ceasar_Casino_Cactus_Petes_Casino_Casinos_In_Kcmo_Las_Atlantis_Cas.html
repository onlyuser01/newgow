    <h1>Stations Casino Bingo Gila Casino Ceasar Casino Cactus Petes Casino Casinos In Kcmo Las Atlantis Cas</h1>

<p>I depositted money, (with no bonus attached), played &amp; won a jackpot. Upon going thru the "validation process" that is required to receive a payout, i was told that the card i use does not accept international deposits, so i would need to send a different card and different bank8ng info. The very next day- i went and OPENED a new bank account that accepts international transactions and meets the casinos criteria. I sent all that info, then received an email saying that my val8dation was ALMOST complete, all i need to do is send a bitcoin wallet address. Well i dont want to use bitcoin. I chose a bank wire, which is one of the 4 options CLEARLY listed as a payout option. And that is why i sent all my bank info. The "validation department" now just no longer responds to my emails. I have sent everything required in order to recieve a payout to find that the "validation process", which is VERY intrusive, never ends. THEY NOW HAVE ALL OF MY peersonal info, front &amp; back pics of my I.D., front and back pics of my debit card, along with my bank account number and all my banking info.</p>
<p>And no payout- no response. I play with other online casinos and have never once had a problem being verified or getting a payout.</p>
<p>My winnings wer way more than the $2,500 max. that i was requesting, however i have given up on getting any of it</p>
