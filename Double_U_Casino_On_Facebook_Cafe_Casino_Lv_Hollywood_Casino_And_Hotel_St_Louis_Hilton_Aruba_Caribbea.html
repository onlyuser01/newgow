<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has issued a new statement in which it informed interested parties that it has launched the petition period for new iGaming certification. This means that any out-of-state company that wishes to be recognized as a Qualified Gaming Entity will now be able to do so, providing that it meets the regulator’s requirements.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the license, an entity will then be able to launch any of the three verticals currently supported by the State of Pennsylvania as a legal and regulated form of gambling. The Commonwealth will now make it so that a Qualified Gaming Entity will be able to operate online without any tether to a land-based property in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The process will begin on January 3, 2023, and run through March 3, 2023. During the previous period, which took place in 2018, only one entity was deemed as eligible to enter the Keystone State as a Qualified Gaming Entity. This goes to show the rigorous process that the PGCB puts in place when it seeks to award licenses this way.</p>
<p>Presently, the state is looking to fill up the remaining 12 certifications which could go for $4 million each. They are available across three different categories, including poker, casino table games, and slots. The status of a Qualified Gaming Entity is desired one by companies that want to ensure that they have direct access to the state’s gambling audiences.</p>
<p>Presently, Pennsylvania’s gambling industry operates based on a mode that expects all iGaming websites to be tethered to a land-based property, that is the state’s casinos. However, should there be sufficient Qualified Gaming Entities, Pennsylvania’s gambling market could rapidly expand, bringing fresh opportunities to players, and even making the market more competitive.</p>
<p>As to Pennsylvania, the state itself will be keen to benefit from further tax revenue from gambling proceeds flowing into the state’s coffers. Pennsylvania posted strong results in November, with the monthly total handlereaching $452m. Meanwhile, the Keystone State has remained a focus of interest by suppliers looking to break further ground in it.</p>
<p>Internet Vikings and Greentube teamed up for a partnership in the state, as reported previously by Casino Guru News. More similar partnerships are expected, especially if newly Qualified Gaming Entities are approved as part of the latest certification process.</p>
