<p>The new nationwide marketing campaign by BetFred called “Let’s Get Ready to Rumble” will debut hits weekend on Sky Sports and BT channels. This headline campaign by the bookmaker from Manchester will welcome sports fans in the UK to stadiums and what’s even more entertaining is that it will feature the legendary boxing ring-announcer Michael Buffer. His well-known catchphrase is the motivation behind the name of the advert.</p>
<p>Betfred’s Campaign Was Developed by Zut Media</p>
<p>Zut Media, an advertising agency based in Liverpool, developed Betfred’s campaign and with it, the bookmaker celebrates the return of live sports environments and the way that they drive massive fan engagement and passion.</p>
<p>In the advert, Betfred shows its massive sponsorship portfolio in the UK which includes rugby league, boxing, snooker, soccer, golf and darts. The theme song is “Get Ready For This,” a popular dance anthem by 2 Unlimited released in the 90s.</p>
<p>Matt Thompson, the campaign director, stated that Buffer is the world’s most renowned sporting announcer and hence, there’s no better candidate to star in a campaign in which sports and its “spine-tingling moments” are celebrated.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the fact that Betfred’s team is extremely passionate about every sports event that they sponsor, as well as sports, in general. The creativity of Zut Media meets Betfred’s passion and together, they celebrate the return of sports in its normal state.</p>
<p>All of the digital platforms of Betfred will feature the image of Michael Buffer, and the program will also be promoted across the 1,470 betting shops that the company has across the UK. Buffer has also partnered with Betfred in an advert concerning safer gambling and 20% of airtime will be dedicated to messages on that topic.</p>
<p>Buffer said that the one thing that he absolutely loves about Betfred is that Fred, just like him, loves the action, and that he is a very passionate sports fan.</p>
<p>He also said that he himself is a massive sports fan and he loves every bit of it – the agony that comes from a defeat as well as the thrill that comes with winning. Buffer thinks that they keep every sports fan going and since Betfred is featured in so many sports, this will make a fantastic relationship.</p>
<p>Betfred is Expanding on the US Market</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, Betfred made a significant move into its US expansion by partnering with Paragon Casino Resort. With this development, all visitors of the casino resort will be provided with a rather unique betting experience as Betfred has launched the Draft Room Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Moreover, the general player experience has reached a new level at Betfred after Future Anthem became a partner of the sportsbook back in March.</p>
