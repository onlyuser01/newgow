<p>The Atmosphere is Great in Miami Heat’s Locker Room</p>
<p>The Miami Heat won the Eastern Conference by beating the former East champions, the Boston Celtics. The final result was 4-3 in what was one of the most exciting series in the history of the conference. The Heat went 3-0 up, but then the Celtics equalized. Then, in Game 7, the Heat players absolutely demolished the Celtics at TD Garden in Boston with 103-84 on the scoreboard. The most interesting fact is that they entered the game as -275 underdogs.</p>

<p>The boys from Florida are even bigger underdogs in Game 1 of the 2023 NBA Finals. Can they upset the odds once again? They sure have high confidence ahead of the June 1 game, with the atmosphere in their locker room being at top level.</p>
<p>You can be sure that they’re going to be fired up on Thursday, but do they have the manpower to beat the Nuggets in Denver? Well, they do have some amazing players on the roster. Jimmy Butler, for one, has been sensational since the start of the postseason. Then, there’s Bam Adebayo whose job in the 2023 NBA Finals will be to try and stop Nikola Jokic.</p>
<p>Nikola Jokic Looking Unstoppable Right Now</p>
<p>Although he failed to win the MVP award for the third time in a row, Nikola Jokic has been brilliant this season. He was averaging 24.5 points per game in the regular season, along with 11.8 rebounds and 9.8 assists. Those are great numbers, but that’s nothing compared to what he’s been doing in the postseason.</p>
<p>In the playoffs, “Joker” is averaging 29.9 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 10.3 assists. What this means is that his average game in the postseason sees him record a triple-double.</p>
<p>Also Nikola Jokic received a standing ovation at home as he made nba history by having the most triple doubles in a single post season! 🥹🃏👑🐐 that’s our triple double king! pic.twitter.com/CbWbNi2QJA — Tatiana (@Tatianaclinares) May 23, 2023</p>
<p>Anthony Davis and his Lakers teammates were unable to stop him in the Western Conference Finals, so it’s very likely Bam Adebayo &amp; Co. will struggle to tame Jokic as well. Actually, history teaches us that Jokic simply loves playing against Miami. He recorded a triple-double in two of their last four duels. In the other two, he got a double-double each time.</p>
<p>Miami Heat vs Denver Nuggets 2023 NBA Finals Prediction</p>
<p>The Denver Nuggets have all wins in their last 10 home games, and we don’t think the Miami Heat are going to put an end to their superb run at Ball Arena. We think that Jokic and his teammates are going to run riot on Miami in Game 1 of the 2023 NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Pick: Denver Nuggets to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
