    <h1>Borgata Online Casino Nj Casino In Ny Bay Mills Casino Little River Casino Manistee Mi Top 10 Online</h1>

<p>Hello, Cnorth98,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience, and I am so sorry for the delay. To be honest, I was convinced that I already replied here and invited the casino to the thread. I had to forget about it or did not add the post correctly here. I even remember how I checked your email earlier. I am sorry once again.</p>
<p>However, please note this is not a Live Chat, and anyway, it usually takes some time until any involved party replies - sometimes several days.</p>
<p>Now I would like to invite MyStake Casino's representative to join this conversation and participate in the resolution of this complaint. Let's ask them for the details.</p>
<p>Dear MyStake Casino team,</p>
<p>Could you please provide us with a detailed explanation of the player's situation? What steps should the player take to unblock the account and/or withdraw his disputed winnings?</p>
<p>If there is another account registered by the complainant, what personal information was filled out upon registration? Do I understand correctly that upon reopening request, the casino asked the player only for his DOB, username, and email? Wouldn't it be better if the casino asked him for more personal information, such as name and surname, exactly for the purpose to prevent similar situations? Could the casino discover another account easily during communication with the player about the reopening of his disputed account?</p>
<p>If the casino had requested verification or more details upon reopening request, it would likely not have happened at all. But, the player was allowed to deposit to this account, reopened by the casino, which for now (and based on communication with the casino provided by the player so far) looks like it could have been partially also the casino's fault.</p>
<p>Were any bonuses used in his disputed account? If yes, which bonuses and on which account? If not - what type of games did he play and from what type of games were the disputed winnings accumulated? What unfair advantage did he gain by playing this way?</p>
<p>If we are talking about a breach of the casino's Terms and Conditions, is the casino able to substantiate its decision with relevant evidence?</p>
<p>Feel free to send the necessary evidence to my email address (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for providing the information.</p>
