    <h1>Casino Near Memphis Tn War Horse Casino Lincoln Uptown Casino Redhawks Casino Casino In Mississippi</h1>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I was blocked by the operator with my access to both Vulkan Vegas and Ice Casino. I can't get into my account. I also don't know if I can call up the chat history myself. Here the operator of the casinos may provide us with all message traffic in the four accounts (2x Vulkan 2x Ice).</p>
<p>But I had also contacted them several times by email and asked for the sum of my deposits. The operator had therefore been aware for some time, at least in a way that could be attributed to him, that the accounts were one and the same person, namely me. Some of the deposits were made using the same credit and debit cards. My documents had been uploaded for months. These could have been checked long ago. An obvious omission on the part of the casino when they shouldn't have. At the same time, only carrying out the check in the event of a payout means that I could never have made a profit with all deposits before the first payout. Because the profits were retained, as happened here. Therefore, there is an obvious misuse of purpose. My total deposit would have been refundable. A unilateral enrichment right of the operator through reference to his invalid terms and conditions, which he would like to apply here, is not compatible with either civil law or criminal law. There is obviously a clause that is used by the casino operator to cheat the player. These machinations should be pointed out and the casino should be given to consider whether they want to continue this behavior. Because not only the karma will soon make itself felt here, but also my determination to pay it back to the one who obviously wants to cheat me out of my profits and money.</p>
<p>The casino has already pledged around EUR 1300.00. Why is this money not paid out to me now? We can then continue to argue about the remaining few hundred euros.</p>
<p>So again for the Vulkan Vegas Casino to write down. I want my legitimate winnings. Roger that!? Or can you now explain to me, in accordance with the applicable legal system, why these have been withheld from me for so long and I should not then be entitled to a refund of my deposits. Here, as already pointed out several times in long chats, they hide behind their own terms and conditions, which, however, cannot develop any validity for the entrepreneur at all, since they can be unilaterally interpreted fraudulently, and obviously are too.</p>
<p>For me, the good reputation of the Vulkan Vegas Casino here in the forum is an absolute mystery and since I've been waiting for my money for some time now, I'm asking everyone involved to move this matter forward quickly.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Thomas</p>
