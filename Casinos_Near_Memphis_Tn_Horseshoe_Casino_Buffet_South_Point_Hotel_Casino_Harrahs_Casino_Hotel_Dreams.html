<p>Account ID Jk**31</p>
<p>My name is Joseph K<strong><em>-H</em></strong> and I have been a victim of credit card fraud, and identity theft. I don't have an account with you, but someone who has stolen my identity and used my credit cards / bank cards and has created an account(s) under my information, I would like to know how, and when did this individual create accounts under this email j***8@gmail.com and who knows what other ones without my acknowledgement, i just got home from Afghanistan from my deployment and i see my cell phone has been stolen and my bank accounts all have been compromised i see your company has been involved in this bank mess i have now your company has allowed someone who has stolen my name my ID's, my credit cards, and use them within this company. I was able to recoup my iPhone back thanks to a tracking feature on the phone and this company and I see the fool saved login credentials to this gaming site within the phone so thatâ€™s how I have been given access to this fraudulent account. Platinum Reels has allowed this individual to fraudulently without my acknowledgment charge my bank cards to an account created with my information. Identity theft as well. I never gave permission for this nor was I aware of this happening while I was overseas. what are my options i do have a police report and also I have an affidavit from the perpetrator who they finally caught. These documents are attached. All my email passwords have been changed, everything is a complete mess. 4 other gaming companies, were all hit up as well, im at a loss of $9,650.30 total. I would like my money back</p>
