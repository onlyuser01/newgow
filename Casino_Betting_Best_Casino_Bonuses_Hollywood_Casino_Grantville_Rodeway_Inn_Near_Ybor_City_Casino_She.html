<p>Boyd Gaming announced its mobile sports betting app, B Connected Sports, has been completely revamped to provide all-new mobile betting experience for Nevada sports bettors. The significant upgrade to the app came from International Game Technology’s (IGT) PlaySports betting platform.</p>
<p>The new technology platform Boyd Gaming gained access to due to a multi-year partnership deal the casino operator signed with IGT in August, under the terms of which it could utilize the PlaySports betting solution and introduce self-servicing wagering kiosks in its Las Vegas properties.</p>
<p>Wide Selection of Betting Markets</p>
<p>The new B Connected Sports app will offer sports fans in Nevada one of the widest selections of pre-game and in-play wagering markets in the state, featuring football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, golf, car racing, darts and rugby, on games taking place not only domestically in the US but also overseas.</p>
<p>“Mobile and in-play sports betting are more popular than ever, so the new and improved B Connected Sports app comes at the perfect time. With B Connected Sports, we’ve created a mobile experience that is both easy-to-use and unrivaled in its selection of betting options, making it one of the most robust sports betting products in the state of Nevada.” Bob Scucci, Vice President, Race and Sports Operations, Boyd Gaming</p>
<p>The all-new sports betting app features multiple betting options for each sporting event, with in-play wagering available for major games, facilitated by an extensive wagering menu to allow bettors to get the most up-to-date, in-game action with instant scoring updates, before they decide to place an in-game bet.</p>
<p>Modern Look and Easy Navigation</p>
<p>Besides the extensive menu, the B Connected Sports app has a new look, implementing a modern design and easy to navigate functions. The user-friendly interface allows customers to receive quick updates to sports betting odds and immediate information on payouts on each betting market, letting them be at ease and enjoy the game.</p>
<p>In addition to the wide variety of sporting events to choose from in the new B Connected Sports app, sports bettors in Nevada will have betting markets on horse racing events, pending regulatory approval. Until then, punters willing to bet on horses can still do that via the previous sports wagering app.</p>
<p>The all-new sports betting app in Nevada is not the only improvement stemming from the partnership with IGT. In September, Boyd Gaming signed with Flutter Entertainment-owned brand FanDuel, to allow the daily fantasy and sports book operator to launch its mobile app in Iowa and Illinois, with the latter also featuring the opening of a retail sports book in Par-A-Dice Casino in East Peoria.</p>
