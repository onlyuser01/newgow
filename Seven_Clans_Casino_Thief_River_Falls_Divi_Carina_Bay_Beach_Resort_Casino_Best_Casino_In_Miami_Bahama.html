    <h1>Seven Clans Casino Thief River Falls Divi Carina Bay Beach Resort Casino Best Casino In Miami Bahama</h1>

<p>Seeking to improve its standings in Sweden, the gambling and sportsbook operator Betsson has signed the famous Swedish soccer ex-star Pontus Wernbloom to its roster of brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Wernbloom Joins Betsson after a Thrilling Career</p>
<p>Wernbloom is a famous soccer player who has competed under the banner of some of the best teams in Europe. His career includes tenures in the Greek team PAOK, in the Russian club CSKA Moscow and in the Dutch team AZ Alkmaar. Wernbloom’s latest stint was under IFK Göteborg.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old player recently retired from playing competitively. By agreeing to team up with Betsson, Wernbloom demonstrates a commitment to continue supporting professional Swedish sports – a sector that the operator is keen on investing in. As a brand ambassador, Wernbloom will participate in various activations where he will promote soccer, sports, and Betsson’s brand.</p>
<p>As an ally of Betsson, Wernbloom joins the likes of the hockey star Christian “Fimpen” Eklund and the tennis and padel professional Jonas Björkman.</p>
<p>Wernbloom Is Excited to Produce Premium Sports Content</p>
<p>Wernbloom commented on his new position as a brand ambassador of Betsson. He called this position “his first real job ever” and added that he hopes the operator will allow him to do the same thing it did with Fimpen. What Wernbloom refers to is Fimpen’s agreement with Betsson, which saw the two work on Fimpens Resa (Fimpen’s Journey) – a web series dedicated to hockey.</p>
<p>Betsson’s new brand ambassador hopes that he will be allowed to do a similar thing but for soccer. He said that he has some surprises in store but does not want to reveal everything as of yet. Wernbloom concluded that he is really excited to take the next step in his career and start talking about soccer instead of playing.</p>
<p>Robin Olenius, the PR manager of Betsson, said that the company has long sought a soccer brand ambassador. The operator wanted someone with a big heart and a sense of humor – qualities that it found in Wernbloom. Olenius explained:</p>
<p>“We wanted someone who fits in well with our other ambassadors and is committed to everything we do. Football [soccer] is undeniably the biggest betting sport and together with Wernbloom we will continue to create the industry’s best content.” Betsson PR manager Robin Olenius</p>
<p>Betsson Sweden has once again demonstrated a commitment to the professional Swedish sports sector. The operator’s sports content has grown to be beloved by the local fans, with Fimpens Resa’s fourth season earning over 7 million views on YouTube.</p>
