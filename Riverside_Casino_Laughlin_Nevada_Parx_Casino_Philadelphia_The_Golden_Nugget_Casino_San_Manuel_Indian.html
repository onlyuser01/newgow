    <h1>Riverside Casino Laughlin Nevada Parx Casino Philadelphia The Golden Nugget Casino San Manuel Indian</h1>

<p>The 2020 edition of the Polish Bookmakers Awards was dominated by Fortuna Zakłady Bukmacherskie, the Polish subsidiary of Czech-based gambling company Fortuna Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>5 Titles out of 8 Categories</p>
<p>The prominent bookmaker took home 3 other prestigious titles, Best Offer, Responsible Bookmaker and Best Marketing, besides the main Best Bookmaker Award which was given to the gambling group for a third consecutive year. For the Best Marketing prize, Fortuna was joint winner with forBET.</p>
<p>In addition, the Best Affiliate Manager Award was given to Igor Koslinski, an employee at Fortuna, to round up the total number of awards for the gambling group to 5 out of 8 different categories.</p>
<p>A group of top industry experts from the Polish betting and gaming sectors decided the nominees and winners for each of the 12 categories considered during the 2020 edition of the prestigious event, while the winner of the Customers Choice Award was decided by the players’ vote on the legalnibukmacherzy.pl website of the event organizers.</p>
<p>The 2020 edition of the event, which took place online to avert gathering of people indoors and comply with social distancing rules, featured two prominent sports personalities, European indoor heptathlon champion Sebastian Chamara and the winner of the eSports WTCC/WTCR 2019 Championships Jakub Brzezinski.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the organizers Legalni Bukmacherzy, Adam Bielinski, CEO at parent company iGamingNuts, outlined that 2020 was a very specific year which forced operators to implement changes to their strategies in their stride due to the cancellation of major sporting events and suspension of action in top leagues.</p>
<p>“The whole industry approached the subject in a creative way – the bookmakers extended their offers, introduced new marketing activities, and most importantly, they did not abstain from improving their products.” Adam Bielinski, CEO, iGamingNuts</p>
<p>Fortuna’s Competitors</p>
<p>Fortuna’s main rival, committed to eSports bookmaker STS, lost some ground on this year’s event, having won only 3 prestigious awards, compared to the 4 the sports betting company won in 2019. STS won the Best Mobile App, Best In-Play Bets and Best Customer Service awards to once again receive industry recognition for its efforts.</p>
<p>Superbet, a sports betting operator based in Romania, also took 3 prestigious awards, taking home the Debut of the Year and Innovation of the Year prizes, besides getting most player votes to win the Customers Choice Award.</p>
<p>By the end of the ceremony, Adam Bielinski outlined that the third edition of the annual awards was appreciated by the audience, which acknowledged efforts to organize the event and the “substantive approach to the topic”.</p>
<p>Widely commented on social media, the 2020 edition proved to be the most important “event of this kind on the Polish market”, Bielinski concluded.</p>
