    <h1>San Pablo California Casino Casino Online Live Sugar Creek Casino Harrington Casino Free Online Casi</h1>

<p>Hello, 22:40:06 on 22-01-2023 I made a request to withdraw funds to bitcoin.</p>
<p>This casino says that the withdrawal takes up to 48 hours, but I still have not received the money.</p>
<p>Account verified.</p>
<p>I get answers like this all the time:</p>
<p>"We understand and we are sorry for the delay. It takes up to 48 hours for our financial department to approve of your withdrawal and then it is up to Softgamings and the anti money laundering policy, that is why it may take longer for it to be approved by all sides in the process"</p>
<p>"The information I want to share with you is that coingames.bet approved your withdrawal request, part of the process is that our provider has to release that withdrawal which can be any time from the moment when we approve it.</p>
<p>The important thing is that your funds are safe, and are heading your direction. Meaning that, you are going to receive your funds of course."</p>
<p>"Hi Darya,</p>
<p>your withdrawal is approved from our end, we are waiting our provider to release it. Dont worry, your money is safe, and sorry for the delay, when we launch our decentraliezed version, things wiil be much faster.</p>
<p>Regards, Nikola"</p>
<p>And this is the first time I've encountered this. And what about their provider? Why is their provider delaying payments? And here is the anti-money laundering, why is it not written anywhere how long it can take and it seems to me that $ 200 is not the amount for this?</p>
