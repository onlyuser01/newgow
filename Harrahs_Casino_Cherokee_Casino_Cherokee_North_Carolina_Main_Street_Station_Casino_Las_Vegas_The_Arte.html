<p>In light of increased demand for classic table games, the Pala casino-resort changed its poker room to an Asian Gaming room featuring pai gow and baccarat. Ensuring the staff and visitorâ€™s safety, the operator follows strict COVID-19 health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>Pala Casinoâ€™s Newly-Opened Asian Gaming Room</p>
<p>The Pala Casino, located in San Diego County, California used its space previously occupied by a poker room and switched it to pai gow and baccarat games. Using the poker room space, the operator introduced its Asian Gaming Room early in September. The newly-opened room features nine tables and is smoke-free.</p>
<p>Visitors of the Asian Gaming Room can enjoy Face Up Pai Gow Poker, Mini-Baccarat, Queens Dragon Pai Gow Poker, and Double Deck Blackjack. Furthermore, no visitor of the new gaming room is going to miss seeing the beautiful bamboo carpeting, the gaming tables featuring lotus flowers, and other unique design features inspired by the Eastern culture.</p>
<p>ðŸ“¢COMING SOON! Weâ€™re adding some exciting games to our newly-opened Asian Gaming Room, including two more Face Up Pai Gow games &amp; double-deck Blackjack! Watch for our announcement next week when these new games go live! ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>In an interview for The Press-Enterprise, a spokesman for the resort, Coley McAvoy said that the casino-resort no longer offers poker on its premises. According to him, the main reason for this is because in poker games the necessary social distancing from the players is difficult to be achieved. With that in mind, McAvoy assured that the necessary COVID-19 health and safety measures are followed and the gaming tables are separated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the operator has also reduced the maximum number of players to three players for all table games except for baccarat where four players can join. Additional measures that are safeguarding the health of both guests and visitors are the thermal cameras located at the entrance of the casino-resort. In addition, the wearing of masks or face coverings is also mandatory.</p>
<p>According to McAvoy, there is another reason for the property to change the purpose of its poker room. He outlined that the Pala casino-resort has seen an increase in demand for the traditional table games which resulted in the change.</p>
