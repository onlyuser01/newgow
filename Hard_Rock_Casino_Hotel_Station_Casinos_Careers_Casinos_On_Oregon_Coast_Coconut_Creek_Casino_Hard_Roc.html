    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Hotel Station Casinos Careers Casinos On Oregon Coast Coconut Creek Casino Hard Roc</h1>

<p>Continuing its mission to create a unique social gaming experience through shared wagering, online provider Livespins has added another heavyweight name to its prestigious line-up. Slots developer Yggdrasil Gaming will join Livespins’ unique live slot streaming platform. In mid-January, Livespins added Fantasma Games to its platform. At the end of March, it was iSoftBet’s turn to join the socially charged platform.</p>
<p>Livespins Reaches Another Important Milestone</p>
<p>The new partnership is prone to benefit both parties. Livespins’ chief control officer Michael Pedersen considers the company has reached yet another crucial milestone by adding the Yggdrasil Gaming powerhouse to its portfolio. Following its uninterrupted path to completely revolutionize the social gaming scene, Livespins will have its top streamers play Yggdrasil’s best games and keep viewers “on the edge of their seats” with each new reel spin.</p>
<p>Pedersen considers their success at attracting Yggdrasil Gaming into their story as solid proof of the top-notch experiences they can deliver to players and gaming studios interested in leveraging the massive growth triggered by slots streaming.</p>
<p>Thanks to the curated online gaming content that it uses, Livespins can significantly cut its cost per acquisition along with marketing costs, while enjoying better engagement and customer retention rates, and reaching wider demographics.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Gaming’s commercial operations director Andrew Pegler believes these slot streaming experiences will keep growing in popularity in the upcoming years. He added that the new Livespins partnership will allow them to enjoy better engagement rates in the streaming community while enabling the same streamers to bet behind the fast-paced action going on across their top games.</p>
<p>In exchange, this should raise the profile of their games even more, while accessing a much wider audience. By joining the Livespins platform, Yggdrasil will be able to better motivate its passive players to turn into active players by joining the live fun on stream in a safe manner. The Livespins platform fully complies with the highest responsible gambling standards in the industry.</p>
<p>How Does Livespins Live Slot Streaming Work?</p>
<p>While similar to Twitch experiences where an audience watches a streamer play live games in real-time, slot streaming comes with a few notable differences. Besides using the main screen to watch the heated reel action and the live chat window to talk to the group and the selected streamer, Livespins’ live slot streaming also enables viewers to get actively involved in the action. Namely, they can instantly turn into players by placing their own bets alongside the streamer and the rest of the chat group members.</p>
<p>Livespins has therefore developed a unique live casino alternative that enables the audience to enjoy much more than the standard one-way watching experience. The audience can pick a favorite streaming room and play along with them, place real-time bets behind them, set their own stakes, and choose a desired number of spins, win and lose their own money, provided the streamer wins or loses.</p>
<p>At any given moment, Livespins’ platform allows players to see the streamer’s winnings and bets, the success rate of the group, and the amount they have personally won during the game. Players are also allowed to access the chat and all of its functions, share emojis with the streamer and the rest of the players, place bets against other group players, or even bet together with the rest of the audience in the tournament mode.</p>
<p>Live slot streaming experiences can reunite massive crowds consisting of hundreds of players at a time who can place their bets simultaneously with the streamer. Livespins is eager to include animated gifs to add more thrill to the experience in the near future. Players can also share their favorite clips or a full gaming session on their socials as all sessions are recorded. When a massive win occurs in the room, the operator will have the chance to share the respective video for promotional purposes, advertising the game and the brand itself.</p>
