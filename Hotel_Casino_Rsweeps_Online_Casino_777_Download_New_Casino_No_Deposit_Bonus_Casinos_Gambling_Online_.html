    <h1>Hotel Casino Rsweeps Online Casino 777 Download New Casino No Deposit Bonus Casinos Gambling Online</h1>

<p>My account was suspended because I was unable to verify myself on the gaming site after a withdrawal request was made. The reason for this was that I did not realize that verification was necessary until it was too late. Consequently, I then received an email from the gaming site stating that my account had been closed and that all remaining funds would be paid out after 5 days as per their terms and conditions. I was asked by mail to provide various bank account details to facilitate my refund. I responded with this information in an email and received an automated confirmation that their finance department had received the information. The following week (today), I was told there was a technical error and that the funds could not be paid out to my bank account. It was stated that to proceed with the refund of the remaining balance, a screenshot of an e-wallet such as Skrill/Neteller must be provided. However, I don't use these e-wallets, and according to the casino's terms and conditions, the payout should be done using the same payment method as the deposits and that the money should be in the account within 5 business days, a period that has already elapsed.</p>
<p>A "technical error'' is not something I should be held responsible for; the casino should handle it in accordance with their own terms and conditions. I have also asked to have my account reopened because it has been completely closed, in order to be able to verify myself.</p>
