<p>OtherLevels has received an official authorization to run its cross-channel marketing and engagement platform for the sports betting and iGaming industries in West Virginia. The state’s Lottery Commission has approved the company as fit for business, predicating its decision on due diligence in OtherLevels’ previous work in the country and any association with bad actors.</p>
<p>With OtherLevels cleared for launch, the company is now active in 11 states where online sports betting has been legalized, making it one of the most significant players in the vertical. This means that OtherLevels’ has a footprint in an estimated 22% of the total legalized market in the country, and it continues to seek licenses from other states.</p>
<p>OtherLevels CEO Brendan O’Kane is positive about the future of the company and its ability to win over regulators to launch its products. OtherLevels, O’Kane argues, is fully committed to building its share of the regulated gaming market, adding:</p>
<p>“We look forward to serving our clients alongside the expansion of legal gaming across the country.” OtherLevels CEO Brendan O’Kane</p>
<p>A Powerful Engagement Specialist Across the Board</p>
<p>The firm uses an advanced solution known as Sports Engagement Platform, which delivers on various aspects of the sports betting experience, including content, publishing capabilities, and odds feeds to engage fans prior to and during a game, as well as offer further engagement opportunities after the game’s end.</p>
<p>OtherLevels also features a powerful CRM and digital messaging solution which allows partners to benefit from sports betting, gaming, and lotteries opportunities.</p>
<p>“With each new participating state, we’re committed to delivering the highest quality player engagement solutions to our gaming and sportsbook partners. We’re excited to be a part of gaming’s growth and potential in the United States.” OtherLevels CEO Brendan O’Kane</p>
<p>OtherLevels has been in the news in 2021, as the company has shifted into a higher gear and sought to empower several US businesses. The company teamed up with the FireKeepers Casino Hotel to boost its casino online player engagement. Similarly, OtherLevels tied up a partnership with Scientific Games’ Open Arena platform to boost customer retention and engagement.</p>
