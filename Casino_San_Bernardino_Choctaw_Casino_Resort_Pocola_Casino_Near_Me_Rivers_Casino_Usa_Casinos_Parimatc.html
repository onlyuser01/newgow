    <h1>Casino San Bernardino Choctaw Casino Resort Pocola Casino Near Me Rivers Casino Usa Casinos Parimatc</h1>

<p>Dear Busterivany and Casino Guru,</p>
<p>In response to your request related to the Player’s complaint, we would like to indicate the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>The payments on the Player’s game account are suspended until the end of the verification process according to the provisions of Clause 85 of the Company’s terms and conditions:</li>
</ol>
<p>"Betting company reserves the right to verify the gaming account holder's identity and suspend transactions and/or payout for the gaming account at the time of verification."</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The verification procedure is now taking more time than usual, it is caused by the necessity to obtain additional proof of his identity from the Player and to check the information/documents provided, which is specifically regulated by Clause 86 of the Company’s Terms and Conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We make every effort to ensure that the player will pass the verification procedure as soon as possible, and we are very sorry that this process has been delayed. The reason for the delay is that we have not yet received all the requested documents for the player's verification, specifically the bank statement, which would show all deposits to the player's account and his full name. Please note that the entire statement must be in one document for successful verification, so we do not recommend taking screenshots. The correct way is to download the entire statement from the bank's website and mail it to us. We will be happy to continue processing the player's documents and verify his account as soon as we receive all the necessary data. We hope that this information will be sufficient to resolve the Player's complaint. Please let us know if anything else is required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Parimatch</p>
