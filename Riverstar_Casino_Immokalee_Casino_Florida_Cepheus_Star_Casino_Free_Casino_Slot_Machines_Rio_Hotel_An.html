    <h1>Riverstar Casino Immokalee Casino Florida Cepheus Star Casino Free Casino Slot Machines Rio Hotel An</h1>

<p>Dear Artcasino and Matej,</p>
<p>I hope each of you had a good start into the new year.</p>
<p>Many thanks to both sides for discussing this case intensively and objectively. That goes to you too, Artcasino, for continuing to participate in the discussions. This definitely speaks for you.</p>
<p>I think that CasinoGuru considered your casino to be fair as basically they apply the same rules as most casinos. As a long time player I can attest that you are up to the standard of the rules.</p>
<p>It is only about the discussed rule 10.1.6. This is about the logic of the rule in my case.</p>
<p>Matej has emphasized and explained this several times. I also said at the very beginning (November 27th, 2022!) that I can understand the rule if my winnings had increased and the casino would not pay out the additional winnings. Although this type of rule implementation would still not be player-friendly and fair, it would be understandable.</p>
<p>It seems you have already made changes to the rule as it is no longer confusing and is much more clearly defined in two sentences. At the time of my play this was not the case. I have already addressed that.</p>
<p>I look at your statement</p>
<p>"Nevertheless we will change that rule after this case is closed and</p>
<p>we invite you to check our bonus T&amp;C once again."</p>
<p>as a way of recognizing that you haven't formulated your own rule quite fairly. Perhaps you should interpret this rule differently so that winnings from wagering the bonus without breaking the rules remain unaffected and only further additional winnings after wagering the bonus for breaking the rules are retained. Also, you should change the subtleties that I've already written as arguments to versusodds. Because all my listed arguments indicate that the bonus had ended and was therefore no longer subject to any bonus rules, 10.1.6 is also irrelevant. Singular and plural play a crucial role! Otherwise rule 10.1.6 would be fallacious and should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Regarding your point 2:</p>
<p>I immediately requested a withdrawal when the bonus was wagered and only then placed the three bets.</p>
<p>I always issue a withdrawal immediately after a bonus has ended. If conditions are still linked to the money earned, the system reports and I as a player am then in the picture.</p>
<p>The saying "The bank always wins" is not without reason. We all know this is a fact, otherwise there would be no casinos.</p>
<p>As a player, you are all the more happy when you win something and, above all, have turned over more than â‚¬40,000 . Sticking so much to the 96â‚¬ seems to me like too expensive a farce.</p>
<p>That is 13333.33 spins on the slot machine at â‚¬3 each vs. 32 spins on the slot machine at â‚¬3 each. Think about these numbers. ðŸ˜²</p>
<p>I think it's a purely "corporate political" decision that you haven't come around yet. Otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned changing the rules after this case was closed.</p>
<p>Why not show insight and goodwill now ðŸ˜‰?</p>
<p>I rely on Antillephone and Versusodds to look at this case objectively and, most importantly, logically.</p>
<p>Until then, have a good time and stay healthy.</p>
