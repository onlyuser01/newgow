<p>Oryx Gaming is expanding its footprint in the Dutch market through a new partnership with Jack’s Casino, which is also launching in the newly regulated gambling jurisdiction. Jacks.nl will now feature player account management (PAM) iGaming platform and content.</p>
<p>Both companies have received formal approval from the Kansspelautoriteit or the Dutch Gambling Commission to operate in the market and offer native products in the fast-expanding online casino vertical in the country.</p>
<p>Oryx to Empower Jacks.nl to Deliver Impeccable Experience</p>
<p>As a Bragg Gaming Group company, Oryx Gaming stands for quality and has a detailed product portfolio that will empower Jack Casino’s offer. Jack is part of the JVH Gaming and Entertainment Group, which is well-represented in the Netherlands with no fewer than 85 retail properties in the country as a casino operator.</p>
<p>Through the implementation of the Oryx PAM solution, Jacks Casino will be able to benefit from a range of important features that will empower the experience in a compliance-ready manner.</p>
<p>This includes payments, data services, as well as a full-degree CRM platform, anti-fraud detection, analytics, and more content management systems that together will allow Jacks Casino to deliver on a leading experience in the newly regulated market. Through the CSM solution, the Jacks.nl platform will allow players to have access to 10,000 dedicated iGaming titles delivered through aggregators.</p>
<p>Building from Retail Casino Company into Digital One</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, JVH Gaming and Entertainment CEO Eric Olders explained that the rollout was long in the making, and the company had been looking to expand its retail footprint to the online gaming space. The resulting platform will provide consumers with premium online sports and casino offers, Olders said, and welcomed Oryx’s integration:</p>
<p>“In Oryx, we have a strong technical partner with a fantastic platform, and its substantial content portfolio enables us to offer the most sought-after games in the market; and we look forward to a long relationship and achieving great things together.” JVH Gaming and Entertainment CEO Eric Olders</p>
<p>Bragg CCO Chris Looney welcomed Jacks.nl’s launch and said that his company was delighted to be partners with what could soon be the leading Dutch iGaming operator. He confirmed that the partnership between the companies was arranged in Q4 2020, and the present launch was the result of that.</p>
<p>“It has been an exciting time since the much-anticipated Dutch online market opened in October, and this partnership is a cornerstone of Oryx’s future growth in the region, which is of great strategic significance for the company,” Looney added.</p>
<p>As a supplier, Oryx has been able to secure numerous important entries in markets across Europe this year. The company received a license from the United Kingdom, and it launched in Greece through a Novibet partnership in August.</p>
