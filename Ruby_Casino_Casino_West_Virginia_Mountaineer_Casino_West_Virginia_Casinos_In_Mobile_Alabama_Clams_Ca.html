    <h1>Ruby Casino Casino West Virginia Mountaineer Casino West Virginia Casinos In Mobile Alabama Clams Ca</h1>

<p>Received a "Friday Loyalty Reward" of NZD19.98 by 21 Jan 2023, played a few hours on Table Games- Blackjack. On the same date, the wagering requirement (35x) was satisfied.</p>
<p>The amount of my cash account has been rolled up to NZD9751.00. Trying to request withdrawal cash of transactions:</p>
<p>NZD4,000.00 x2</p>
<p>NZD1,000.00 x1</p>
<p>into the nominated verified bank account.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have received two free spins for the following:</p>
<p>10x</p>
<p>25x</p>
<p>And I was trying to activate them. When I got into the game prompt, the message said that my account had been suspended. Contact customer service for the issue.</p>
<p>Customer service claimed that my account had been activated again for play. When I checked my history, my cash withdrawal request had been cancelled.</p>
<p>However, the funds in the cash account have changed to NZD100.00 instead of NZD9571.00.</p>
<p>I have contacted customer service again; they are just using the condition that they can only withdraw up to NZD100.00. The rest of my lucky winnings have been confiscated by the casino. Yes, the cash that was supposed to be mine has been taken away by the casino.</p>
<p>I argued that if they can withdraw up to NZD100.00, they should leave the uncashable portion in the bonus account instead of in the cash account. Because the cash account is considered your bank account, and the money should belong to us. However, they claimed that their Payment Team have the final decision to either pay or "adjust" the account balance.</p>
<p>The main argument is that if they only allow people to withdraw NZD100.00, the amount should not demonstrate in a cash account instead of in the bonus account. Therefore, the correct demonstration should be Cash Account: NZD100.00, Bonus Account NZD9,471.00.</p>
<p>Because the term and system demonstration was ambiguous, confiscating my balance in the cash account is illegal.</p>
<p>Request:</p>
<p>I request that Bitstarz return the confiscated cash account amount of NZD 9751.00 to my cash account and approve the cash withdrawal requests.</p>
