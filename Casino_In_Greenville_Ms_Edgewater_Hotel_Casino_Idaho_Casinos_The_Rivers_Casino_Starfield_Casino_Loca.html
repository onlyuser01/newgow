<p>Leading B2B software provider for the iGaming industry NuxGame has expanded its payment options with the integration of a crypto-focused gateway</p>
<p>The partnership with CoinPayments will allow partner operators to benefit from cryptocurrency payments and make the process smooth and straightforward. CoinPayments will allow NuxGame’s operators to utilize crypto payments for their iGaming offers, including Sportsbook, Affiliate Systems, and Online Casinos, along with other services.</p>
<p>Crypto Payments Arrive on NuxGame’s iGaming Platform</p>
<p>NuxGame is happy to offer this new payment solution, as it embraces the shifting attitude towards innovative payment gateways within the iGaming industry as well.</p>
<p>NuxGame has been successful with the introduction of GumBallPay and Monnet as some of the latest examples of trusted and innovation-driven payment gateways. The company similarly strengthened its content offer with Amigo Gaming and Ainsworth Game Technology over the past months to bring more value to partner operators.</p>
<p>NuxGame CEO Daniel Heywood welcomed the opportunity to see CoinPayments introduced to the B2B’s company platform and enable partners to benefit from the streamlined high-quality experience of settling payments in crypto.</p>
<p>“CoinPayments solutions will provide ease of use to our customers in facilitating cryptocurrency payments, as we utilize the integration as a catalyst for continued growth,” Heywood explained.</p>
<p>CoinPayments CEO Sean Mackay was similarly pleased with the opportunity and said that NuxGame is a great opportunity for the company to collaborate with prominent entities in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>NuxGame is a prominent player in the sector, providing top-notch iGaming software solutions. Our advanced solutions and extensive experience as a major cryptocurrency payment gateway perfectly complement NuxGame’s offerings, resulting in an integration that will prove advantageous for both parties. CoinPayments CEO Sean Mackay</p>
<p>NuxGame has been strengthening its iGaming offer over the past months, with the company teaming up with a number of third-party partners and also enacting a series of internal updates. The partnership with Monnet in March was meant to increase NuxGame’s presence in the Latin American region. Now, CoinPayments will serve as a global payment partner, bringing fresh value to operators that have chosen NuxGame’s solutions.</p>
