    <h1>Eagle Casino Online Gambling Casino Real Money Facebook Jackpot Party Casino Doubledown Casino Free</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I come to this site again asking for help with another unscrupulous casino company.</p>
<p>I deposited 20 pounds via Apple Pay, after an hour of playing I was up to 30 pounds and tried to withdraw… my withdrawal only listed my PayPal as an option so I spoke to the chat to see if I could withdraw to the method I deposited with instead.</p>
<p>The agent informed me that I had last topped up with a paysafe card and withdrawals to these were not allowed so I had to use PayPal. I informed them that I didn’t have a paysafe card, that I topped up with Apple Pay. The agent told me I was wrong and to check with my bank.</p>
<p>because of this, I actioned it to my PayPal instead and waited.</p>
<p>I like to used ewallets as payment methods as keeping personal bank details private online is very important to me…</p>
<p>skip forward to today. I contacts live chat to tell them I hadn’t received any withdrawal, it was at this point I was told that I MUST give my personal bank details over or I wouldn’t get paid.</p>
<p>this is happening more and more with casinos, and I am happy to find them and point them out to other online users.</p>
<p>I told the casino I did not want to give these details, and as I had never deposited with a bank transfer or wire deposit ever - I pointed out how they were breaking their own terms and conditions by insisting I do this.</p>
<p>I was told the only way I could get my withdrawal is by giving these details over.</p>
<p>I have ran into this issue with another online casino. But after casino gurus intervention, the other casino ended up paying to my preferred method and I didn’t have to send any sensitive data over. I am hoping once again you can help me with this.</p>
