    <h1>Gsn Casino Gta Casino Treasure Island Casino Red Wing Mn Rivers Casino Des Plaines South River Road</h1>

<p>Okay, I will go and look again. First of all.. Can u see the actual emails that were used when these accounts were created?? I have already mentioned a couple of times how I had to abandon 2 other email addresses because they and so much more of my information was stolen and misused. In more then just your casino. I also mentioned already a couple times how someone from your live chat told me that it was documented and would not affect my gambling on your site. Also.... I noticed u are not responding to my comments about how unfair it is that u do not allow multiple accounts except the only time u attempt to stop them is when a player wins a big amount of money. And if u can see all these accounts that are apparently mine. How come it's so darn hard for u to shut them all down??? Could it be because you might be thinking maybe someone will start spending their money on one of these accounts again? U are a shady casino . U do not deserve an almost perfect score on this website or any other. You proved my point of how shady u are with your comment .. and I am still going to spread the word how shady and sneaky your platform is. People who work hard for their money deserve to know ....</p>
<p>I can see that the withdrawals you made at the other casinos were relatively small, so they may not have fallen into the same criteria that they need to look at for our processing and were able to be pushed through without further look.</p>
<p>so Basically what u are Saying is even tho u do not allow multiple accounts, u are willing to turn a blind eye and taking peoples money, so as long as they don't cash out too much at one time? Wow... shady ... u are honestly looking like the absolute worst online casino I've ever played at and the saddest part is I used to praise u as tho u were one of the best.... disgusting</p>
