<p>Leading iGaming supplier and developer Gaming Corps will debut its diverse portfolio in the African market thanks to a new partnership with operator GOAT Interactive</p>
<p>The deal marks another significant milestone in the Swedish-based company’s expansion efforts. Gaming Corps is confident that a diverse selection of titles will appeal to new audiences and help GOAT Interactive maintain its leading market position. The operator was likewise enthusiastic regarding the new partnership, hoping to build a long-term mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>The Developer Brings a Rich and Modern Portfolio</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ content will initially be available via GOAT Interactive-owned B2C brand Premier Bet. The operator maintains a substantial presence in over a dozen African countries like Ghana, Angola, Cameroon, Tanzania, and Senegal and soon plans to expand to Togo. Faced with diverse cultures and tastes, Gaming Corps must ensure its content speaks to as broad an audience as possible.</p>
<p>Luckily for the game developer, its expansive and engaging portfolio is more than up for the task. The deal with GOAT Interactive primarily focuses on the developer’s Crash and Mine content, but a broader range of titles will also be available. The studio’s top games, like Jet Lucky 2 and Penalty Champion, are bound to leave an impression on the new audience, but the rest of the roster should also make an impression.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ portfolio already has a proven track record of success, so the transition to a new market should be relatively seamless. A solid selection of lightweight arcade titles features premium gameplay and appealing visuals, while branded versions of the football Mine game will optimize local appeal.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Aid Both Companies’ Expansion Efforts</p>
<p>The new partnership should substantially benefit both parties. Owing to its rapidly growing presence in the African market, GOAT Interactive needs to keep its current user base engaged while reaching out to new audiences. Director of casino at GOAT Interactive Karen Hope lauded Gaming Corps for their exciting and modern titles and expressed a desire to strengthen their newly formed partnership.</p>
<p>We see this studio as an exciting long-term strategic partner as we build loyalty on a hyper-local level across our product offering, numerous markets, and audiences. Karen Hope, GOAT Interactive director of casino</p>
<p>Gaming Corps likewise gains access to a brand new region and the opportunity to cement its position as one of the leading iGaming developers. Gaming Corps head of commercial Danielle Calafato was optimistic that the company’s developing market-minded portfolio would resonate with new audiences and match all their requirements.</p>
<p>We… look forward to customizing our content in order to give Premier Bet’s players the localized experience that is so unique to our offering. Danielle Calafato, Gaming Corps head of commercial</p>
<p>The deal with GOAT Interactive is the developer’s second high-profile achievement in 2023. In January, the company successfully launched in Belgium thanks to a partnership with local iGaming brand Napoleon. Gaming Corps intends to maintain this significant momentum and plans further expansion in Greece and the Netherlands, so the company will likely continue to make headlines.</p>
