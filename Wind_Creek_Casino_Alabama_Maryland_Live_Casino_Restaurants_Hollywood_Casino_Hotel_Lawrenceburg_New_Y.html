    <h1>Wind Creek Casino Alabama Maryland Live Casino Restaurants Hollywood Casino Hotel Lawrenceburg New Y</h1>

<p>I played with Gamdom and I had found out the hard way that there were 2 seperate sessions of the same game going because I had the meter on Lava Gold up to the second tot he last notch. Then I am committed and I deposit planning on finishing the cycle. I get back on the game and I started playing and I realized the meter is half way... I could have sworn it was higher.... So I am confused and I am already losing money and I am trying to grasp the idea that why would I have been so committed at 6.75 a bet when the meter is only half way? So i tried to make the best of it and failed horribly. I was 3 notches away from finishing at that point. So I sat there thinking what the hell was I thinking? Then I go clicking around and I noticed the meter was different for USD and LTC! I am pissed at this point because there was no warning. I have never deposited with USD before that point but then I recalled that the rakeback is given in USD. I pretty much just wasted that money when I could have finished the other one I was planning on finishing but instead I am wasting money catching another cycle up to the other one just so they can both sit at the top and not be able to finish either one. So I go and complain to staff stating that this really hindered my plans and why wasn't I informed of this beforehand? This is important information especially at 6.75 a bet!!! The games had to have eaten a few hundred a piece at that point. So i get mixed signals from staff and I deposit again and I get the meter to where they other one is and lose all the money. I am pissed and I take a screen shot of both the games and they look identical now... I still thought they were 2 seperate games though. I was still wrapping my mind around that part. So one of the employees said he will look into it and I tell him im really low on money now because of this issue and I was going to try to spend what I had left trying to complete one and wait on the other. I completed it and I was doing well so i decided to raise the bet and i failed about half way up the meter. Kinda tight for money I had one last plan. To get the 6.75 meter one still 2 notches away completed then use the money from that one to finish the 16.75. I didnt think i had enough so i tried to build my funds playing another game and failed. I'm a real mess at this point because That curve ball screwed me up. Then I go check on the 6.75 game and it's in line with the 16.75 game!!! I was going crazy then I was trying to contact support and I caught them trying to swindle me!!! They were trying to make me think it was my fault somehow! I am pretty sure when I first complained about them being 2 seperate games they somehow merged them despite me saying if I paid to get both that high and they are the same I was going to flip out. Then they knowing that was exactly the case was trying to switch it around on me every way possiblle and it almost worked if I hadnt compared it with my BCGame account. The support was trying to say that because i changed the bet on one it changed the other to match the one i changed the bet on!!! He said problem solved. Teach you to change the bet on one next time is what he said. He was going to fill my head up with a lie and let me believe it and pay for it!!! That was until I looked on BCGAME and saw I had 3 different sessions with the same game at 3 different bet sizes with 3 different crypto!! I couldn't believe this guy! He was honestly trying to make me believe they didn't tamper with my games!!! I can't believe these guys! They took away about a 400-600 dollar bonus away from me and merged the games! Then I have a bonus about half way up to completed at 16.75 a bet but I can't trust these guys anymore!! I lost out on a lot of money and the situation they put me in is just horrible! I had my finances in order until that curve ball with the games being seperate. Then I compensated and pulled more money in thinking I had 2 bonuses I was going to be able to cash out on. I paid to get them both up to nearly completed at 6.75 a spin!!!! It was super expensive and it created real chaos in my life right now because I made the mistake and tried to correct course jsut to be sabotaged and denied what I put half that money into! Then I took the money I made from the one I got to complete and sunk it into the 16.75 one I got half way but I can't complete it because they tampered with my account to begin with! So my progress and everything is screwed up! I have money that disappeared! I shouldnt be this far out because of this! This is just ridiculous and the whole time they made me feel like I was imagining things!!! Like i made it up!!!</p>
