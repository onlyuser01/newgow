<p>Seminole Hard Rock has become the first privately owned gaming company to receive the US Best Managed Company award.</p>
<p>Seminole Hard Rock Stands Out Despite Covid-19</p>
<p>The 2021 US Best Managed Company prize has been awarded to casino operator Seminole Hard Rock. This is the first time a privately owned gaming organization wins this recognition.</p>
<p>This year’s nominees stand out in terms of strategic planning and execution, as well as employee commitment in the context of a dynamic and resilient culture, and strong finances. All of the above have been achieved despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the 40,000+ team members at Seminole Hard Rock, we are humbled to be the first gaming company awarded the US Best Managed Company designation and to be recognized alongside so many outstanding privately-held businesses.” Jim Allen, Chairman of Hard Rock International and CEO of Seminole Gaming</p>
<p>Allen praised the efforts of all team members whose dedication has been crucial for the success of the organization. He also thanked them for their commitment to service excellence and financial results, which were essential for receiving this recognition.</p>
<p>The US Best Managed Companies program targeted over 500 candidates from around the country in 2021, with 49 honorees chosen from a pool of 70 finalists. A panel of external judges assessed hallmarks of success in four main areas: policy, ability to execute, organizational culture, and financial results.</p>
<p>The Best Managed Companies program consists of honorees from more than 30 countries. The recognition places the awardees in a position of strong local and international recognition for their excellence in management.</p>
<p>Seminole Hard Rock Stands Out With Numerous Accolades</p>
<p>Last month, Seminole Hard Rock was named “Employer of Choice” in the gaming industry, according to results of the latest Casino Gaming Executive Satisfaction Survey. Casino Gaming Industry Executives had the opportunity to rate 34 casino companies or standalone casinos as part of the survey.</p>
<p>The survey was running for six weeks between September and October 26, 2020. Results show that 33% of all participants voted for Seminole Hard Rock as their employer of choice. The second Employer of Choice received slightly more than 20% of the votes, while third place accounted for 7% of the total votes.</p>
<p>Recently, Seminole Hard Rock and Hard Rock International were bestowed various accolades, including Land Based Operator of the Year at the Global Gaming Awards in late 2020. Other awards include a First Place J.D. Power Award for Guest Satisfaction among Upper Upscale Hotel Chains, as well as various employment-related recognitions from Forbes. They include America’s Best Large Employers, America’s Best Employers for Women, and America’s Best Employers for Diversity.</p>
