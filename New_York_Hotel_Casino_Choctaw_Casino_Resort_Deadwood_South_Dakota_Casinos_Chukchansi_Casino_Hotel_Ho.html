<p>Betclic is tapping the talent of Rich Ellis who will head the data department at the company, having worked for over seven years at TSG.</p>
<p>Rich Ellis to Spearhead Data Strategy at Betclic</p>
<p>Betclic is tapping talent from The Stars Group (TSG) with the company scooping up former data science director Rich Ellis who will be stepping in as chief data officer at the company.</p>
<p>Beginning on January 11, 2021, Ellis will head the data department for Betclic and help the company shape strategic decision-making by leveraging big data. Ellis began his stint with TSG in 2013 as a business intelligence analyst.</p>
<p>His hard work saw him climb through the pecking order and arrive at the very top of the analytics and data science within the company in May 2017, four years after he began his career with the world’s leading poker operator.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of TSG by Paddy Power Betfair and FanDuel parent company, Flutter Entertainment, Ellis decided to move onto new opportunities. Ellis is joining Betclic at a time when the company is planning on expanding its data team, EGR reports. Announcing his departure from TSG, Ellis shared this final goodbye on his LinkedIn page:</p>
<p>“After 7 great years at PokerStars, it is time for a change. Special thanks to Vlad Lanin, Steve Walmsley and my awesome team for making it so enjoyable. Wishing you all the best. Excited for a new challenge and to be joining the Betclic Group in the new year!” –Rich Ellis</p>
<p>Betclic Looking to Grow in 2021</p>
<p>According to French media, Betclic is looking to scale up its presence in Bordeaux, Gironde, with the company looking to add some 140 new employees in the region. Presently, Betclic has some 550 employees worldwide.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Betclic has struck a partnership with French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 becoming the official betting platform. At the time, Betclic Everest founder and managing director Nicolas Béraud said that the competitions are the two biggest draws for Betclic sports bettors.</p>
<p>Ellis’ addition to the company should help Betclic find new ways to reengage with an active and sizeable community.</p>
