<p>Galaxy Gaming Inc. is focusing on expanding in the iGaming vertical through its newly-launched arm, Galaxy Gaming Digital. The developer and distributor of casino table games and technology will now use this new division to spur its growth and further development efforts, helping it position itself in the highly-competitive online gaming sector.</p>
<p>Taking on the iGaming Market with New Division</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming Digital is a blanket venture that will help the company push its portfolio of table games while offering a way to market its Galaxy Built titles developed in-house. The new arm will also be in charge of any potential new gaming digital ventures.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Galaxy Gaming CEO and president Todd Cravens commented on this branching into the online gaming space, after previously focusing exclusively on the land-based sector. Cravens assured that the same appreciation for detail would be applied to the iGaming solutions similar to the land-based developments:</p>
<p>The launch of Galaxy Gaming Digital underscores our continued enthusiasm for creating and licensing the best table game content online, just as we have always done for our land-based clients Galaxy Gaming CEO and president Todd Cravens</p>
<p>Cravens confirmed that the company will pursue innovation in the segments it focuses on and work closely with partners to ensure that in-demand products are delivered with some of the leading operators in the industry. The new division will significantly increase Galaxy Gaming’s capabilities to expand into the online space and deliver excellent titles adapted for the digital age.</p>
<p>Galaxy already has a track record for developing both online and land-based table games, but the arrival of the dedicated division is a more determined step in embracing iGaming. The company’s games have accepted more than one billion wagers worldwide over the past 12 months, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Its games are already available on more than 1,000 online casino websites globally, with titles such as Perfect Pairs, Buster Blackjack, Lucky Lucky, 21+3, and others becoming some of the most appreciated and recognized signature games by the company.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming Digital will continue this tradition while channeling new powers to develop the company’s in-house products which should lead to a more extensive content portfolio to leverage globally. The company is also launching ready-to-play RNG titles for the iGaming sector known as Galaxy Built.</p>
<p>The first collection of the so-called Galaxy Built titles, include Rising Phoenix Baccarat, Split to Double Blackjack, and Roulette Up. The titles are expected to launch later in 2022.</p>
