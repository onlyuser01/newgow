    <h1>Mazatzal Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casino Red Casino Casinos In Portland Oregon Casinos On The East Coa</h1>

<p>January 2,2023 deposited $50 and received a 500% Welcome Bonus. Much luck when playing and built my account to $2500 by January 5th. While playing I clicked an icon and info said History so I clicked and heading said Withdraw click to see if I was eligible to withdraw any of my winnings. Went back to playing and moments later my account was reduced to $940 without any notice or without my asking for a withdrawal. Contacted a representative on Chat and explained what had happened. After a while he responded that I chose the Bonus Bigwin and that I could only withdraw $1000 which was 20 x my deposit. Asked why was $1450 deducted from my account and his response was I chose the Bigwin Bonus and I could only withdraw up to $1000. After attempts to find out why $1450 was deducted and response the same I went back to playing. This really was bothering me so I went to Chat again and another representative answered. I explained what it was I was asking and his response was exactly the same. I still pursued to find out if the $1450 was lost or if I still had access to the funds to play. Again I was told I choose the Bigwin Bonus and I could only withdraw $1000. Frustrated I went back to playing. Thought that if I were allowed to withdraw $1000 I should request to withdraw some of my winnings. Went to Cashier and there I could make a withdrawal. I requested $375 to be mailed to me and that there was no charge to use this service. Three days later went back to the site and played down my excess to $388 and so requested $350 to be withdrawn and sent to me by mail. Both requests were acknowledged and both were free. On Jan. 10th I received six e-mails, two indicated my request for $375 and $350 were declined. Two other e-mails indicated that I was approved to receive $150 of the $375 requested and $325 of the $350 requested. Two more e-mails indicated that $250 Promo Deduction (not sure what this is) was requested and $250 Promo Deduction was approved (NOT BY ME). At this point I felt like any discussions would be futile. High Country Casino did call and left a voice mail but I could not understand the message left after playing it back several times (because of broken language, sounded Hispanic). I tried calling the number but was told the number could not accessed and to hang up and try again, so I did but with no success. If the $250 Promo Deduction was to re-coup the Welcome Bonus that should not have anything to do with my winnings. Also by deducting $1450 from my account without notice is 5 and a half times the Welcome Bonus. And why was $1450 deducted in the first place without notice.</p>
