<p>Aztec Gems Deluxe review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Themed on Aztec aesthetics and precious stones, this game is a trippy experience.</p>
<p>The bright colours and menacing Aztec masks create a world of fantasy rather than a realistic experience of the ancient civilization.</p>
<p>Players will feel like they’ve stumbled into a humid jungle in an adventure film. As they quest for jewels and Aztec relics, they’ll explore this fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Win that includes 2 stacked Wild symbols</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Jungle birds and soft drum beats play in the background of this slot, creating a calming ambiance. Players will likely find it unobtrusive and enjoy the sense of atmosphere the soundtrack lends proceedings.</p>
<p>The animation leans into irreverent style with eye-catching hues and chunky gems.</p>
<p>Ornate Aztec-inspired designs surround the symbols, expanding and glowing as players win. This adds to the feeling that players are on a magical expedition, or that they drank a shaman’s psychedelic tea.</p>
<p>Superb win includes the 8 high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Aztec Gems Deluxe is a three reel slot machine. Each reel has three rows. The game offers nine win lines that are non-adjustable.</p>
<p>The excitement really begins with the bonus features (see below for details).</p>
<p>Overall, this slot is well paced, with each spin seamlessly leading to the next.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Money symbol.</p>
<p>Appearing on all the reels, the Money symbol takes on a random value each spin. It may have Mini or Minor Jackpot values.</p>
<p>The Money Respin Feature begins once other win lines have paid. As the regular symbols disappear, the Money symbols remain and special reels replace the regular ones. These special reels only contain Money symbols and blank spots.</p>
<p>Main bonus feature of the game, the Money Respin feature</p>
<p>Players are initially awarded three Respins. Every Money symbol that lands after each respin will remain in place until the end of the feature.</p>
<p>When players land at least one Money symbol, their Respins reset to 3. The players continue the Respin round until either the positions are filled or they run out of Respins.</p>
<p>When the feature is complete, players receive the values of all the Money symbols. This total is added to the total winnings.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.5%, comfortably over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.09 up to a maximum of $/£/€45.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Aztec Gems Deluxe slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this Aztec-themed slot with high RTP and high volatility.</p>
<p>The jungle world is engaging and the vivid colour palette feels immersive.</p>
<p>The gameplay stays exciting through the varied features and players will love the many bonus features.</p>
