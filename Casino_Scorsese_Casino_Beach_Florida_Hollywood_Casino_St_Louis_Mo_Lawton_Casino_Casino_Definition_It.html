<p>The rights are split into six packages for data suppliers to pick from</p>
<p>Italy’s Lega Serie A unveiled the revision of its betting rights. The top-flight soccer division will tender rights for the 2024/25 season to international data suppliers. For reference, rights for the Lega Serie A have been held by Stats Perform since 2021.</p>
<p>Serie A drafted nine packages labeled A to F(c). Each package covers a different aspect of the betting rights, with Package A being the most appealing to international betting data suppliers.</p>
<p>Also known as the International Sports Betting Package, Package A focuses on audiovisual rights, as well as match and coach data. It covers all approved countries outside of Italy, making it very appealing to global data companies.</p>
<p>Package B, or the Sports Betting Package Italy, on the other hand, covers match data and coach data for the Italian market. Because of the prominence of the Italian gambling market, local companies are likely to be very interested in this package as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Packages C-E cover media data, sports betting tracking data and media tracking data.</p>
<p>The final package, Package F, is split into three sub-packages that cover data included in other packages. Thus, Package F(a) encompasses the data included in A and B. F(b), on the other hand, covers A, B and D. Finally, F(c) combines the rights outlined in Package C and E.</p>
<p>Companies Must Be Mindful of the Rules</p>
<p>While licensees will be allowed to use the rights to form partnerships, they are not permitted to use imagery of Serie A athletes, staff and logos. Licensees can also sign sub-licensing agreements only if explicitly authorized by the terms of their license.</p>
<p>Once a company is approved for a betting rights package, it must accept responsibility for managing the rights. In addition, it also has to pay a security deposit of 15% of the license fee. After that, the approved firm must pay the remainder of the license fee in three installments.</p>
<p>The first installment must be paid by July 1, 2024, with the other two to follow on November 1, 2024, and March 1, 2025. The same payment timeframe will be used in the following years as well, the league noted.</p>
<p>Licensed companies must commit to providing monthly updates to Serie A, informing the league of the top 10 markets in terms of gross gaming revenue. Licensees must also provide the league with player behavior data and information on Serie A’s performance compared to other Italian sports leagues.</p>
