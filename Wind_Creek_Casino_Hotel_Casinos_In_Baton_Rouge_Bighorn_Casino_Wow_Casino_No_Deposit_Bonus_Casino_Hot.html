<p>Relax Gaming, a leading provider and aggregator of iGaming content, has penned an agreement with a new studio. The innovative developer SmartSoft Gaming joined the list of Relax Gaming partners, becoming the latest addition to the Powerd By Relax platform.</p>
<p>SmartSoft Joins Relax as Its Latest Studio Partner</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SmartSoft’s innovative and varied content will be brought onto Relax’s aggregation platform, further diversifying the latter’s portfolio. Powered by Relax already boasts more than 4,000 games and is the to-go solution for many operators in the sector.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, SmartSoft will be able to quickly expand its presence, making its titles known among more players. The studio, founded in Georgia almost eight years ago, is famous for creating a myriad of hit tiles. Its suite of titles includes a rich variety of dynamic games and slots, as well as a selection of premium virtual casino games.</p>
<p>All of SmartSoft’s games boast intuitive and flashy designs and are engagingly gamified as the company seeks to provide its fans with premium experiences. The company has been producing truly innovative titles since 2018 when it released JetX, an exceptional non-traditional title that pushes the limits of what iGaming can be.</p>
<p>Relax Is Happy to Add SmartSoft Content to Its Aggregation Platform</p>
<p>SmartSoft Gaming’s chief executive officer, Guram Gotsadze, spoke on the agreement, saying that he is excited to announce this partnership. Gotsadze praised Relax Gaming for being one of the leading players in iGaming and called the deal “a great opportunity to bring exciting content to a global community of players.”</p>
<p>The CEO concluded that he is looking forward to fruitful cooperation with Relax Gaming and its Powered By platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s director of casino products said that her team is delighted to have SmartSoft on board. She is sure that the addition of the developer’s titles will “elevate the aggregator’s game portfolio” and added that she is very excited to add JetX to Relax’s offering.</p>
<p>The deal rounds up a fantastic year for our Powered By Relax program, which saw us draw up deals with numerous exciting new partners. Through a simple integration and reaching a larger captive audience, we’re able to provide high-quality games to players worldwide. Shelley Hannah, director of casino products, Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is hailed as one of the best aggregators in contemporary iGaming. Thanks to this, it was recently decorated with several awards, including Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider at the EGR B2B Awards, Casino / Slot Developer of the Year at the SBC Awards and Best Game Provider at the AskGamblers Awards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Relax Gaming just announced the release of a new game called Grim the Splitter.</p>
