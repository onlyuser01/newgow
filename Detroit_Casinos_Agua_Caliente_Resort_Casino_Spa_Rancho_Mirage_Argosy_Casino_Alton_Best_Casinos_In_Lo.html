    <h1>Detroit Casinos Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa Rancho Mirage Argosy Casino Alton Best Casinos In Lo</h1>

<p>Spain and Latin America- focused gaming operator Codere Online recently donated $300,000 from its football betting proceeds to NGO “She Wins.” The funds will help empower women through sports and education.</p>
<p>A ceremony on 8 July commemorated the partnership. It was held at Codere’s Hipodromo de las Américas located in Mexico City. Attendees included Codere Online Coordinator of Social Networks Claudia Angélica Pacheco López, “She Wins” General Director Cecilia Vales and professional soccer player Nailea Vidrio. The NGO thanked Codere for the initiative and pointed out that the support of such large companies enabled its efforts to empower women and lessen gender inequality. In return, the operator noted that this initiative was another step in its continued commitment to women’s personal and professional development in Mexico and Latin America through sport.</p>
<p>The Operator Maintains Other Pro-women Initiatives</p>
<p>This donation was not the first time Codere supported women’s rights. The operator’s ongoing #CodereConEllas campaign provides in-depth digital meetings with women involved in soccer like athletes, administrators, and technicians. They share their experiences working in this predominantly male-dominated sport and highlight the challenges and difficulties they had to overcome to make a place for themselves. Famous names include Desirée Monsiváis, “Rayadas” striker and top scorer in the Women’s MX League, Real Madrid C.F. defender Kenti Robles, and Tatiana Briseño, sports manager of Mexico’s Club Pachuca Femenil.</p>
<p>Codere’s Angélica Pacheco López stated that connecting the company’s social objectives with the social initiatives of its partner clubs and teams was very gratifying. She highlighted their shared values and satisfaction in doing their part for the community.</p>
<p>Together, we now do our bit so that many women achieve their dream of turning soccer into the best bet of their lives. Claudia Angélica Pacheco López, Coordinator of Social Networks for Codere Online</p>
<p>Codere Is a Notable Player in Latin America</p>
<p>Codere used this initiative to highlight its commitment to responsible gaming practices. The company launched in 2014 and currently focuses on online casinos and sports betting. It was the first Latin America-based operator to become publicly traded on Nasdaq. Codere’s core presence is in Latin America, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and Uruguay. The company also has a substantial presence in Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>The operator has secured partnerships with soccer teams Real Madrid, River Plate in Argentina, and Mexico’s Monterrey Rayados. Codere’s Q1 2022 financial results were promising, showing a 24% increase in net gaming revenue, totaling €22.2 million. Company officials expressed their expectations for increased growth during the rest of the year. With a balance sheet of over $100 million, the company will continue to focus on its Latin American market.</p>
