    <h1>Las Vegas Hotel Casinos Moon Spins Casino Casino Arizona 524 N 92Nd St Scottsdale Az 85256 Robert De</h1>

<p>Yeah man I understand you, I am from Australia so I am stuck with all those shifty casinos. You are from Netherlands so I am sure you would be able to make stake account, rollbit buebit and all the big crypto casino. Viper spin is doggy casino that only cares for them selves and they will go to extends of making new rules just to stuff you around and your winnings. And as you can see I am perfect example I was nearly last level where they give you 1000 euro free no wagering bonus and they ended up closing my account for being assholes. So what is your case ? Is it big amount of money ? Cause I can help you spread the message as I have reach and influence and I got my issue resolved but at the cost of my account that I consistently used for 1 year and 2 months. So yeah definetly try to get your money and close off the account cause they don’t have issues taking your money instantly but when you are to win, they choose how and when they want to pay you out, plus their ridiculous withdrawal limits. After pumping just over 38k in the account and finally winning 12 k from 180 deposits I was only able to withdraw 9400 the rest I was pretty much forced to gamble in between so that I won’t lose the account or money. My email is jovansmiljanic96@icloud.com. Feel free to email me and I will do my absolute best to help you out.</p>
