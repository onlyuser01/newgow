    <h1>Hotels Winstar World Casino Pa Online Casino No Deposit Promo Codes For Existing Users Stardust Casi</h1>

<p>thanks for the help and hope you can get the amount paid to me.</p>
<p>This day, an email came to me about an offer they had, but I'm a pensioner and</p>
<p>do not have a lot of money and must admit that it is tempting to jump on</p>
<p>an offer, to maybe be lucky to win a little, but unfortunately I did not have that pleasure.</p>
<p>So I couldn't afford it, but wrote to them if they could give me a free bonus, as did I</p>
<p>can be lucky to win without having it.</p>
<p>I got Erik and he didn't have any free bonus for me but I had some points that I could play</p>
<p>for. I didn't realize I could, so I thanked him and then asked how to do it</p>
<p>and he explained to me that I could exchange these points for spins. I don't remember how many points there were,</p>
<p>but it turned into approx. 1950 spins and I then asked how much I</p>
<p>had to playthought to win something and he said that I could go into Transaction's story for that</p>
<p>to see .... Okay.</p>
<p>So I did, and there was 9,597.00 thinking I will never get that ..</p>
<p>I should then have made euros of these approx. 1950 spins so I contacted again and got Logan who told me</p>
<p>that there were 4 games that I could play these spins on, and also asked him how much I should play</p>
<p>through (playthought) and he said the same as Erik about going into transaction history there I could see it all</p>
<p>and I then played the approximately 1900 spins that I had exchanged from my points through FRUIT ZEN and PINOICHIO. There should be 2 more games but they did not, because maybe it could have been more.</p>
<p>I got 239 euros to play for this ...</p>
<p>I was lucky and it went well and after several hours I was up at approx. 3000 euros,</p>
<p>I then sent all the documents that they asked for, but I had a new bank card, so what they had standing I should have changed so I contacted them again and it was then a lady that I unfortunately do not remember the name to help me change the card number.</p>
<p>She was outright disgusting and after a long time she came back and said that I could only pay 50 euros</p>
<p>because it was spins and not points, and I had not paid anything, then I could not get paid more than 50 euros and immediately I got the feeling that they had not thought that I could play 9,596.00 through and would try to cheat me ...</p>
<p>The next day I got hold of Logan, who had been kind to help me from the start, but he was also the opposite now, very uncomfortable .. I should have said like this lady that to get paid, I naturally had to pay and I told him then that neither he nor Erik had told me, and to that he replied .... you didn't ask?</p>
<p>Of course I was very upset because I have never won over 100 euros and this could help me ..</p>
<p>I then contacted Logan again the same day and asked to have the 2,850.00 back in my account, then I would deposit</p>
<p>an amount and try to get a little out of it this way ... but no they were deleted ... and it was naughty ..</p>
<p>It was not serious and I hope so that you can help me get this money, because I am convinced that it is cheating, because I am 75 years old and they are easy to cheat, but I have through them last few years paid</p>
<p>to these points ...</p>
<p>I can only say thank you so much for taking care of us who are weak there.</p>
<p>Many friendly greetings</p>
<p>Anna Lise <strong><em>*</em></strong>*</p>
