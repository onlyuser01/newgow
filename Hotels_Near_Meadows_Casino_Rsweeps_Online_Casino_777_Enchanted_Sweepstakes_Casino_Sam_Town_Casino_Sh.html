<p>The company celebrated a milestone moment for the market in Canada after seeing its slots award the 50th jackpot surpassing one million dollars</p>
<p>Global gaming company International Game Technology (IGT) confirmed that its Wheel of Fortune and Powerbucks slots awarded the 50th jackpot of more than CA$1 million in Canada. The debut of the globally-recognizable slots from the leading gaming company in the country dates back to 2016. Gradually growing, the number of millionaires that have secured a prize in Canada from the Wheel of Fortune and Powerbucks slots, has now reached a milestone moment with the 50th lucky player securing a life-changing prize.</p>
<p>Judging by an announcement by IGT from Thursday, which comes after the recent publication of the companyâ€™s Sustainability Report, in less than a week, multiple jackpots dropped. The string of jackpot wins started in New Brunswick, Canada, on June 25, 2023, when a lucky online Powerbucks player enjoying Wheel of Fortune Hawaiian Getaway hit a jackpot of CA$1,533,377 ($1,168,300).</p>
<p>Then, only a few days later, on June 27, another Wheel of Fortune jackpot dropped. This happened at the Michael Gaughan Airport Slots located at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. One lucky player of the Wheel of Fortune Triple Double Emeralds slot won the life-changing $1,330,134 jackpot prize.</p>
<p>Shortly after, another Wheel of Fortune jackpot dropped in Canada. A lucky online Powerbucks slots customer in Ontario played the Wheel of Fortune Latin Getaways, allowing them to secure a jackpot prize of CA$1,029,546 ($784,400).</p>
<p>The globally-recognized Wheel of Fortune slots were launched nearly three decades ago back in 1996. Since then, IGT says, the slots have made more than 1,100 people millionaires. This translates to jackpot prizes of a sum surpassing $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Company Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Publishing its latest sustainability report, IGT highlighted multiple achievements it hit throughout 2022. Earlier this week, the company unveiled details regarding its latest report, highlighting advancements related to four of its core principles, including protection of its people, support for its communities, fostering sustainable operations and advancement of responsibility.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, IGT confirmed that its CEO of global lottery, Fabio Cairoli, unfortunately passed away. The company acknowledged his strategic guidance, dedication and commitment that helped it grow and expand. Cairoli was an exceptional leader with extensive experience in senior-level roles.</p>
