<p>The launch coincides with the opening of the market in the state, enabling FanDuel to deliver thrilling experiences to bettors and sports fans alike</p>
<p>The leading sports-tech entertainment company that has a strong presence across the betting sector in the United States, FanDuel, announced it continues its expansion across the country. On Thursday, the company revealed that its mobile sports betting application is now available for customers in Kentucky. The latest announcement by FanDuel coincides with the opening of the sports betting market set for 6 AM ET on September 28, 2023.</p>
<p>Entering Kentucky, the betting operator further expands its presence in North America. The latest market entry becomes the 20th state where FanDuel has established its sports betting activities. It comes after successful launches in strategic states with significant market potential, including New York, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Tennessee and Illinois, among others.</p>
<p>Celebrating the new launch, FanDuel confirmed a special offer for Kentucky customers who sign up and place a $5 wager. This will grant them some $200 in Bonus Bets, along with other special and thrilling offers.</p>
<p>The Sportsbook Delivers Its Best-in-Class Services</p>
<p>The entry in Kentucky means that eligible customers in the state can now benefit from FanDuel’s best-in-class platform and betting options. Such include pre-game and live betting on the NBA, MLB, MMA, NFL, as well as college football, soccer, hockey, boxing and many more sports.</p>
<p>In addition to a variety of sports, the sportsbook enables its clients to access horse racing options as well. FanDuel was in fact the first US sportsbook and remains the only sportsbook in the country to offer parimutuel wagering on horse racing along with sports betting via a single account and wallet. Undoubtedly, this is a testament to the best-in-class technology offered by the leading betting operator.</p>
<p>Besides horse racing, FanDuel was the first US sportsbook to introduce live streaming of sporting events within its betting application and bring same-game parlay bets. The operator’s sportsbook stands out with fast, safe and secure options for banking and payouts. It offers 24/7 customer services along with a cash-out early feature.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to bring sports fans across the Bluegrass State even closer to their favorite leagues and teams with our leading Sportsbook product and offerings.“ Christian Genetski, president at FanDuel</p>

Finally, Genetski spoke about FanDuel’s extensive experience in the betting sector and predicted that its services would deliver unique experiences for the passionate sports fan base in the state.</p>
