<p>20Shots, a UK-based sports betting supplier, has teamed up with Generation Web (GenWeb) to launch its F2P Fantasy5 soccer game on Australian sportsbooks.</p>
<p>GenWeb Launches Fnatasy5 F2P Game with Partner Sportsbooks</p>
<p>The popularity of free-to-play fantasy contests is rapidly increasing. Some companies use it as a gateway to traditional sports betting, customer acquisition or just a crash course on interactive wagering.</p>
<p>For betting technology provider 20Shots, their Fantasy5 F2P game is all of the above. The game is already available at PlayUp, EliteBet and TopSport to name a few. Partnering up with Generation Web to break ground on the Australian market, 20Shots has big expectations from the region.</p>
<p>Fantasy5’s staying power with sports audiences is undeniable, and soccer fans are signing up to participate in droves. Leveraging a familiar fantasy soccer experience, 20Shots is connecting with audiences keen to create their own Premier League teams. Once they do, they get to vie for real-money prizes with the pool running at $14,000.</p>
<p>The Generation Web platform which helps with popularizing the game through its own network of partner sportsbooks is already showing promise. 20Shots hopes this partnership would lead to more organic growth for Fantsy5 which is far from having reached its peak.</p>
<p>Fantasy5’s Big Australian Debut</p>
<p>Generation Web will make it possible for Australian players to also participate in the game and claim real money awards. The prize pool for Australian sportsbooks is listed at $15,500. The platforms head, Hamish Davidson, has no qualms about its success.</p>
<p>According to Davidson, Generation Web remains committed to working with partner companies and providing them with the best and most innovative products to guarantee higher customer engagement. “We’re delighted to be the first platform to make Fantasy5 available to Premier League fans in Australia,” he added.</p>
<p>Davidson said that he was looking forward to seeing how well the platform would fare in Australia. The goal is to replicate the success Fantasy5 has enjoyed in its domestic market. 20Shots co-founder Jacob Kalms is happy to see traditional sports fans from Australia engage with the company’s fantasy product and the Premier League.</p>
<p>“Our organic growth and retention rates suggest that operators will benefit from the stickiness of the product when introduced to their audience at scale,” Kalms said.</p>
<p>He confirmed that 20Shots will continue to seek more opportunities to team up with global operators. This way Fantasy5 can reach audiences from all over the world.</p>
