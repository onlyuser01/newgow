    <h1>Ocean Online Casino Wind Creek Casino App Mole Lake Casino Sweep Casino Sc Casinos Casino Planet gen</h1>

<p>First of all, I would like to say that I really only have something against a casino if I really have the feeling that I'm being ripped off.</p>
<p>I've really been playing for so long and so incredibly much that I've gained dozens of experiences over the last 2 decades and I'm not a person who constantly complains.</p>
<p>Of course, I rarely had a problem here and there, but I was always able to resolve it with patience.</p>
<p>But Casino Planet and I really don't like to say that and often but these are scammers in my eyes.</p>
<p>When you consider how many players here have been accused of betting higher than allowed and that compares to other casinos, that's pretty striking.</p>
<p>I haven't been playing since yesterday, and I don't file a complaint if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>I once had a case where I deposited â‚¬200 and played with a bonus and brought it up to â‚¬12,000 and upon withdrawal I was told that my winnings were removed because I bet higher than allowed. I had really made the stupid mistake that evening and placed 1 bet with 50 â‚¬ - unfortunately it was unintentional but I was aware of it and the matter was settled for me! It was very annoying but it was my own fault!</p>
<p>With this 12.000â‚¬ I didn't take any further action so why should I do that with 1000â‚¬? I did this because I was cheated and I'm still 100% sure of that today!!!</p>
<p>I always read the T&amp;Cs before I play ALWAYS!</p>
<p>I also always pay very close attention to how much I use when I play with a bonus!</p>
<p>But at casino Planet, I'm supposed to have made â‚¬15 bets shortly before the end of the wager, which is not true! ðŸ™‚ why should I? ðŸ™‚ and as I said IF I had done this I would have closed the matter and not filed a complaint.</p>
<p>To be honest, I find it very cheeky to accept PDF files as proof because anyone can forge them.</p>
<p>I can see if I still have the history! If you look closely you can see that something can't be right, but nobody was interested.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I'm writing you so full here, but Casino Planet I'm really not good at addressing that.</p>
<p>For me, they all belong together.</p>
<p>Please pay attention, there are more and more players being accused of having bet more than allowed!</p>
<p>I've never been so mad at a casino!! Not even when I had â‚¬11,800 removed from â‚¬12,000 for going against the bonus rules.. not even then was I as mad as I was at casino Planet.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is inappropriate but I can't stand this casino.</p>
<p>The way they're kidding their customers is beneath all dignity.</p>
