    <h1>Boat Casino Near Me Casino Slots Free Hardrock Casino Tampa Mgm Vegas Casino Casino In Monticello Ny</h1>

<p>I am requesting a refund of all my deposits maid minus any withdrawals since I asked for self-exclusion/ account permanently closed due to gambling addiction I opened an account with pin-up casino in 2020 after many losses I wanted to close my account permanently because I have a gambling addiction, I opened live chat on their website and asked to be self-excluded because I have a gambling addiction they made it so difficult to do this they said to email support so I emailed support and asked for my account to be closed because of my gambling addiction I was still able to deposit the next day so I went to live chat and asked for a refund because I asked to be self-excluded and was still able to deposit I emailed support again asking to be self-excluded because I have a gambling addiction I had multiple times asked for my account to be closed and it’s still open to this day and i have lost a lot of money at this casino, lately I have had enough they have constantly stalled my withdrawals resulting in me losing money because I have been left as long as 8 week’s waiting to withdraw my money I feel they are stalling my withdrawals Because they know I have a gambling addiction and will just spend the money this has happened and multiple occasions I have had 1000s of withdrawals cancelled by them I have lots of emails and open tickets with them about the issue I have had</p>
<p>I also requested all my chat transcripts they refused to provide them I also asked for my deposit and withdrawal history they said they can't provide it I have also my 5 complaints with askgamblers regarding this casino</p>
