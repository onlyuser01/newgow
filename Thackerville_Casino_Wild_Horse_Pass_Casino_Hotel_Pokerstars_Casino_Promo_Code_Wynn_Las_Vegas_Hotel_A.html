<p>We’ve reopened this complaint as per the player’s request as the payments were discontinued.</p>
<p>Additional comments from the player:</p>
<p>"Hi again Viliam,</p>
<p>Sorry to disturb you one more time. If you remember my claim against BitDice casino, finally they agree to pay 85.000$.</p>
<p>Starting since December 2021, the deal was to get paid 10.000$ per month until finish the total amount (December 2021, January 2022, Febrary 2022, March 2022, April 2022, May 2022, June 2022, July 2022 and August 2022).</p>
<p>In April they didn't pay and they do it in May. But right now, they owe 10.000$ from June, 10.000$ from July and last 5.000$ from August that are the last one.</p>
<p>After some emails I send to them, one of those was answered on 5th July, writing apologies in name of BitDice for the delay and ensuring that in 10 business days they will pay 20.000$. After 10 business day, not any more answer to my couple emails, and they didn't pay anything.</p>
<p>We are in August, last month to get paid the last 5.000$, so the total amount they owe are 25.000$ and I haven't got any other answer for my emails to they.</p>
<p>Can I ask for your help one more time?"</p>
<p>"Hi Petronela,</p>
<p>The problem persist, those were the last 25.000$ of 85.000$ total prize to get paid. So If you will be so kind to open again the claim and send a note to BitDice Casino responsable to argue why the last payments havn't been done, I could have a chance to collect them, because with my emails nobody of they were answered by BitDice.</p>
<p>On 5th of July they contact me and send apologizes about delay on payments, but said in 10 business days June and July will be paid. Never happened. And now in August, last 5.000€ also weren't paid so... last 25.000$ I'm asking for.</p>
<p>Could you be so kind to re-open the claim again please?"</p>
