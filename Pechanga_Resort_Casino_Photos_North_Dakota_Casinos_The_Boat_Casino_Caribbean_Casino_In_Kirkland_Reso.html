<p>Pragmatic Play Releases New Live Casino Title</p>
<p>The company unveiled Wednesday the release of PowerUP Roulette, a new engaging gameshow-style live casino game. The new title fuses the popular classic casino experience of a roulette game and adds a modern twist, introducing lucrative bonuses that offer players a chance to win additional prizes. Similar to other live casino games, PowerUP Roulette is broadcasted from Pragmatic Play’s state-of-the-art studio. The studio of the leading content provider uses 4K cameras that stream with significantly low latency, offering a life-like experience for customers online.</p>
<p>“We’re extremely proud of what our development and production teams have delivered with PowerUp Roulette – it’s another incredible creation that brings a fresh interpretation of a timeless classic to the Live Casino space.“ Irina Cornides, chief operating officer at Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play’s chief operating officer, outlined that the company offers a diverse portfolio that delivers unique high-quality entertainment for online players. She pointed out that the company is proud of PowerUp Roulette.</p>
<p>“Our product portfolio showcases a diverse range of games that are all about delivering high-quality entertainment,“ added Cornides.</p>
<p>According to her, the new game title is a modern twist on a classic casino game that complements Pragmatic Play’s continuously growing live casino content. Cornides pointed out that the company currently offers classic games, as well as modern titles that provide immersive experiences for the players. Last but not least, she said that innovative mechanics help boost player experience and engage with different players.</p>
<p>PowerUP Roulette Features Bonus Rounds</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that PowerUP Roulette offers a convenient and easy-to-use user interface, similar to other titles offered by the leading content provider. The modern twist of the title offers innovative features that boost the experience for players and the chances of winning higher prizes. Pragmatic Play’s recent title features up to five PowerUP bonus rounds, granting the players additional chances to win. According to Pragmatic Play, if the ball “lands on one of the preannounced PowerUP numbers, the game continues with a PowerUP bonus round in which all straight-up bets qualify for additional prizes, on top of anything won already.” Then, the next PowerUP bonus rounds increase the available prize pool for the player.</p>
<p>By the fifth such bonus round, maximum prizes may vary between 2,600x and 8,000x. Combining the prize from a straight-up bet with all PowerUP bonus rounds may result in a prize range of 800x to 15,525x or a maximum payout of the mind-blowing €500,000 ($486,000). Besides PowerUP bonus rounds, the new title also offers convenient options such as auto-play.</p>
