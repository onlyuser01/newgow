<p>BET99 described GeoComply as having “more experience than any other geolocation provider and a commitment to innovation”</p>
<p>Canada’s top-tier online sportsbook and casino, BET99, has selected the supplier of anti-fraud and geolocation solutions, GeoComply, as its new geolocation provider for the Ontarian market.</p>
<p>Last week, BET99 announced the launch of its new BET99 App in the Apple App Store during Week 1 of soccer. The app, which is currently live and available for download, has been designed “to deliver an elevated experience with an enhanced design” tailored to Canadian players’ preferences.</p>
<p>BET99 Looking to Boost Customer Experience, Compliance, and Revenue</p>
<p>BET99 has based its decision to partner with GeoComply on its desire to improve customer experience and boost its compliance and revenue.</p>
<p>By using GeoComply’s new zero-download mobile and desktop solutions, the 2019-founded Toronto-based online gaming operator expects to open the player funnel and improve their conversion rates. This will be achieved by allowing mobile and desktop players alike to immediately prove their location on their platform without going through the hassle of leaving the current page or downloading any special plugins or apps.</p>
<p>Since GeoComply aims to protect operators during all stages of players’ journeys, BET99 can also expect to benefit from better anti-fraud solutions that can identify account takeovers, players who abuse bonuses, the use of spoofing devices, and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>These solutions will be provided starting with the sign-up procedure up to the depositing and cashout steps that all players must follow as part of their online experience.</p>
<p>The No Download Browser Solution</p>
<p>Bet99’s chief technology officer, Paul Nyzuk, expressed their excitement for the new partnership inked with GeoComply, which he described as having “more experience than any other geolocation provider and a commitment to innovation,” as proven by its brand new No Download Browser Solution.</p>
<p>Nyzuk added that their top priority was to guarantee that players will enjoy the best experiences possible while reaching the highest compliance standards in the industry with GeoComply’s “cutting-edge technology.”</p>
<p>GeoComply’s senior vice president, Lindsay Slader, also expressed their thrill about BET99’s decision to adopt their fresh technology, explaining it would make geolocation compliance “easier than ever” while helping them stay compliant, safe, and profitable.</p>
<p>At the start of September, Simplebet announced it would launch micro-betting with Bet99 as part of its goal to take the betting world by storm. During the same month, GeoComply revealed a record surge in online betting in the context of the start of the NFL season.</p>
