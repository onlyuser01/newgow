<p>i can explain you here too i am playing on this site since 6 month or more i make my account do deposit and withdrawals and verified my account with my adhaar card, selfie and card, then playing normally like depositing and withdrawals were good then one day i made withdrawal and they ask me to verify my bank statement then i upload my bank statement they told me to do upload a specific date slip which is of 19th may deposit i upload it. and then they verify that all and after that asking me to upload passport or driving license then i tell them that i don't have passport because i haven't applied it for because i am too young don't need it yet and my driving license is pending to be delivered by rto authority it will be delivered in few days can i upload my pan card for verification they say ok upload it. and then they rejected it and say that whether upload passport or driving license so i tell them to blocked my account when i will receive my driving license i will unblock my account and upload there.. after 2 days i have received my driving licences and tell them to unblock my account they unblock it then i go to upload my driving license i see that my pan card verification still there ongoing and i talk to support that remove this i will upload my driving license and verified my account they told me to wait for sometime then i come back after sometime and see my account were not opening then i go back to support they told me your account permanently closed for failed in verification and mark as fraudulent.. dear nick when i am providing with them with my all valid documents, cards , selfies, and bank statements then how anyone can be say that i am failed in verification or found as fraudulent lol i am cursing myself to be loyal user from this site for a long when they were launched ðŸ¤£ and still they think i do fraudulent ask them to give solid reason to blocked my account and ask them to unblock my account as soon as possible ðŸ¥º</p>
