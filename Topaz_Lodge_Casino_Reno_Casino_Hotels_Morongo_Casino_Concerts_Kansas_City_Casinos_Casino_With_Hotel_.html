<p>The Casino Esport Conference will return to Las Vegas in 2023, hosting another edition of its famous esports and iGaming-oriented event</p>
<p>The Casino Esport Conference, an annual event that is at the forefront of the gaming revolution, unveiled news about its 2023 edition. The upcoming iteration of the event will return to Alexis Park Resort in Las Vegas in the first quarter of the next year.</p>
<p>Details about the Upcoming CEC Event</p>
<p>In a recent announcement, the Casino Esport Conference (CEC) provided dates for its next edition. The upcoming edition of the event is scheduled to take place at the Alexis Park Resort in Las Vegas from February 27 to March 1.</p>
<p>Alexis Park would be a familiar place for people who have followed or attended previous editions of the CEC. The 50,000-square-foot property will once again welcome influential experts who will talk about online gambling, esports, sports, AI, VR and various other technological advancements and their entertainment potential. There will be more than 1500 representatives from various iGaming companies from the US and beyond.</p>
<p>During the event, video gaming and casino specialists will engage in conversation, discussing the common future of the two industries. This year’s CEC edition promises to be the biggest one, according to the organizers, and will have the most attendees and speakers yet.</p>
<p>The CEC Will Once Again Help Esports Connect with Other Industries</p>
<p>The CEC pointed out that during its previous edition, almost half (43%) of the attendees were C-level executives from various gaming companies. This, according to the organizers, proves that CEC is an event that provides industry specialists with the opportunities they need to connect with peers in the sector and get to know other companies better.</p>
<p>The CEC describes itself as “the only conference covering the legal, policy and regulatory dimensions” of getting into esports betting. It is a two-day hands-on event that seeks to connect people in the esports sector with representatives of the casino, college and cinema sectors, among others.</p>
<p>The event is in its sixth year and hopes that the upcoming edition will provide esports, iGaming and other businesses with tons of new opportunities. It will also teach various businesses everything they need to know about incorporating esports into their offerings.</p>
<p>In 2022, the CEC expanded with a new event in Atlantic City. The so-called CEC/EIC Northeast Summit took place in October and was a collaboration with Stockton University’s Esports Innovation Center.</p>
