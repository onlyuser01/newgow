<p>Sheriff vs Bandits Slot Review</p>
<p>A five-by-three slot with a great theme, Sheriff vs Bandits will appeal to the lot of you who enjoy cowboy yarns about renegades and a righteous sheriff. If other Western-themed games have failed to fully play out the conflict between the law and bandits, Sheriff vs Bandits has made sure to hit the mark.</p>
<p>The game features unique and authentic gameplay elements, a lot of gunslinging, and excellent background music to set off the gameplay. With a max payout of 2,500x, you will soon realize that playing either side of the law can be a lucrative venture, but it will be down to you to choose your path. This is easy since you can try the Sheriff vs Bandits online slot for free in our demo on this page.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Where to Cowboy?</p>
<p>Sheriff vs Cowboys slot is spot-on when it comes to thematic depth. The gameplay revolves around a western town that is beset by bandits and protected by the sheriff. Steam trains are coming in and the lounges invitingly waiting for people to start shooting at each other.</p>
<p>The music only adds to how immersive this slot is, with a few slightly modern notes that can be just made out undermining the theme a bit. Yet, you will travel around town and hit symbols such as The Bank, The Saloon, and The Store. Visit the train station where a steam train is parting or coming in raising a cloud of dust in the air and get many Wanted Posters, and a Sheriff looking for the outlaws.</p>
<p>The game is nothing if not thematic, with the cowboy sheriff swinging his lasso above his head when he appears on a winning payline. Other than that, you will have no trouble believing that this is one of the greatest Western-themed slots you have ever set eyes on.</p>
<p>All the dour-looking men and women who appear in the Wanted Posters wear typical cowboy costumes, and there are a lot of guns being flashed around in a casual yet suggestive manner. All it takes to be a part of the experience is to press the spin button and get bang in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>Sheriff vs Bandits Slot Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The paytable is easy to follow with ten paylines all queued up and a combination of low and high-paying symbols. There is the Sheriff who will pay a 500 payout for 5 of this and The Bank which is the second-highest paying symbol for 200 if you get 5 lined up.</p>
<p>The Wanted Symbols will each pay 20 for 5 of them and The Store and Saloon pay 50 for 5 symbols. The Train will pay slightly more with 100 for 5 symbols and the low-paying A, K, Q, J, and 10 are all pretty standard and will only fetch you 10 for 5 symbols.</p>
<p>A single win line combination can have a maximum multiplier of 50x, Dragon Gaming informs in the paytable, so keep this in mind. Naturally, there is also a Wild Symbol, which will nudge itself in the game and help you replace and finish up missing combinations that are this close to getting a combination sorted out and paying out.</p>
<p>And while on symbols, it’s worth mentioning that you can also get up to 20 Free Spins with a Scatter Symbol. Oh, and did we mention that you have to choose between two feature games beforehand – The Sheriff and Bandits?</p>
<p>It’s down to you which one you pick, but this may help you decide. In The Sheriff feature, you can get multipliers ranging from 2x to 50x your bet size. If the Sheriff appears in multiple places, the prize will be collected multiple times. Now, the bandits act a bit differently.</p>
<p>Each Bandit Symbol will be assigned a random multiplier between 1x and 4x and each symbol will contribute to the winning combination which it’s a part of. The max possible win here is 40x, slightly less but arguably it’s easier to get decent multipliers along the way.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Alright, it’s hard to find fault with the way Dragon Gaming designs its games. We do find the theme to indeed be very rewarding as a whole. Players will enjoy an authentic western from start to finish that comes with dramatic music in the backdrop, the screaming of the wind, and swinging of saloon doors, and the occasional shot fired in the public square.</p>
<p>Sheriff vs Bandits Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is fast, easy to navigate, and very intuitive. You can quickly access a bunch of handy features that will make it easier and more fun to play as well. Players can select max bet or pick a turbo option if they like. Adjusting the bet size is easy and you can stake anything from $0.10 to $50 on a single spin of the reels!</p>
<p>Sheriff vs Bandits Features: Free Spins, Bandits, and a Determined Sheriff</p>
<p>Free Spins: The Free Spins are definitely a great part of the experience as you get to potentially win up to 20 free games that can add a lot to your bankroll, especially when you consider that you are also going to choose a bonus game to go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Sheriff Feature: As explained, the sheriff is determined to keep the law in town, and this means catching bandits and scoring multipliers between 2x and 50x in the process. The game is based on the idea that the sheriff is going to capture bandits with a lasso and each bandit will have an assigned wanted value. Quite thematic and mighty rewarding!</p>
<p>Bandits Feature: The bandits will work in a slightly different manner, with each of these adding a 1x to 4x multiplier if he or she is a part of a winning combination. At the end of the round, you will collect all your winnings in aggregate and leave the round with what is possibly a tidy sum.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: Love Westerns? Can’t Resist Sheriff vs Bandits!</p>
<p>If you do enjoy the setting and like Westerns, then Sheriff vs Bandits is indeed the game for you. You will find the slot to be quite rewarding and bring you worthwhile and fun options in the form of thematic bonus features, multipliers, and free spins.</p>
<p>Although we can find a few faults here and there, the title brings a solid 96% return which makes the gameplay quite decent. Whether you are a law-abiding citizen or an outlaw, the Sheriff vs Bandits slot game has something for you! Try it for free or play for real money right away.</p>
