<p>Elys Game Technology and Cloakbook received a Type B sports betting license in DC - The launch is on 4:00 pm EST on December 29 and marks another successful chapter in Elys’ 2022 story</p>
<p>From Ohio to DC, Elys has been on a tear recently – the company’s Q3 financials were promising, and this latest DC license is the cherry on top for 2022.</p>
<p>Launching On Time for New Year’s</p>
<p>Interactive gaming and sports betting technology company Elys Game Technology and Cloakroom Gentlemen’s Club DC independent business announced they’ve been granted a license by the District of Columbia’s Office of Lottery and Gaming (DCOLG). The sports betting license was issued for Cloakbook, LLC – a joint venture by the two companies. The launch date is expected before the year’s end.</p>
<p>Executive chairman of Elys, Michele Ciavarella, expressed how happy the company was about the news. “We are delighted to have been granted the first joint venture license with our partners at Cloakbook to commence sports wagering services within the Cloakroom Gentlemen’s Club and the Over Under rooftop lounge, our second small business sportsbook installation in Washington, DC”, she said.</p>
<p>The soft launch is scheduled for 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, December 29, 2022, and both companies were excited for the upcoming launch of this new type of sports betting in DC. Managing member of Cloakbook Tony Cavasilios was cited in the press release expressing his satisfaction with the successful completion of the lengthy licensing process.</p>
<p>“This new venture has given us the opportunity to create 15 new jobs in DC and offer customers a chance to parlay an evening of enjoying a meal and beverage in the Over Under lounge while wagering on their favorite team”, he said. The licensing process took almost two years, with subsequent efforts to set everything up supported by Elyse.</p>
<p>Elys Continuing Positive Trend</p>
<p>This upcoming project could mark the beginning of a new trend in DC, setting the precedent for similar localized small-business sports betting startups. These “neighborhood sportsbooks” as the release called them, might turn out to have the potential to breathe new life in localized efforts for economic and financial recovery in post-pandemic times.</p>
<p>Following news of a great third quarter, Elys hasn’t been sitting on its hands. The DC launch is imminent, and its timing for the busy New Year’s sports weekend means many fans will have a lot to be excited about. The Jacksonville Jaguars at Houston Texans and the New York Knicks at Houston Rockets are two eagerly expected events, for example.</p>
<p>However, a recent development on the preparations for the Ohio launch has also made headlines lately. Elys received conditional approval in the Buckeye State. The Ohio Casino Control Commission (OCCC) gave its approval to Elys to start sports betting operations on January 1, 2023, so things are looking even more interesting after this weekend.</p>
