<p>The current acquisition will prove beneficial to both companies and the Irish lottery sector, executives believe</p>
<p>La Française des Jeux (FDJ) has completed its acquisition of Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI). Valued at over $400 million, the deal will expand FDJ’s presence in Europe and turn it into a major international company.</p>
<p>The deal was originally announced this summer when FDJ unveiled its plans to acquire PLI’s entire share capital.</p>
<p>PLI is the exclusive operator of Ireland’s National Lottery. The gambling company is set to operate the lottery for at least the next eleven years, with its current deal set to expire in 2034. For reference, the operator acquired the 20-year National Lottery license in 2014.</p>
<p>PLI also recorded a GGR of $427.6 million (current conversion rates) in 2022, donating approximately $279 million to over 4,000 deserving causes. FDJ, on the other hand, recently posted its latest report, highlighting Q3 revenue of $620.5 million and year-to-date revenue of $1.99 billion.</p>
<p>PLI Is Looking Forward to Enhancing the Irish National Lottery</p>
<p>FDJ’s chair &amp; chief executive officer, Stéphane Pallez, commented on the agreement, saying that it marks an exciting new chapter for the French company, allowing it to step into the international spotlight. FDJ is ambitious to become an international powerhouse and cement its position as a leading gambling and lottery company.</p>
<p>According to Pallez, FDJ and Premier Lotteries Ireland share the same vision as they both want to provide players with recreational and responsible gaming offer to players in Ireland.</p>
<p>PLI’s chief executive officer, Andrew Algeo, also shared his thoughts, saying that this deal is a monumental moment for his company. He believes that the current acquisition will prove beneficial to both companies and the Irish lottery sector.</p>
<p>Algeo thanked PLI’s shareholders whose support has allowed the company to flourish and grow steadily and sustainably. He said that he is looking forward with FDJ on creating an Irish National Lottery that is better than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Speaking of M&amp;A activity, FDJ recently confirmed the finalization of its acquisition of the leading online horse racing and sports betting operator, ZEturf Group. The acquisition of a horse racing company also highlights FDJ’s desire to diversify its product offering and revenue streams.</p>
