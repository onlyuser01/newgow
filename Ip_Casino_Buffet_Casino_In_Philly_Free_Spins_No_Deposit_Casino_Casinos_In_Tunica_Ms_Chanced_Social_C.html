    <h1>Ip Casino Buffet Casino In Philly Free Spins No Deposit Casino Casinos In Tunica Ms Chanced Social C</h1>

<p>Chinese web-based classified ad platform 58.com is under investigation. A Chinese national, responding to an ad on the site, was ultimately kidnapped and tortured for over six weeks after refusing to do a different job than what had been posted. He ended up in Sihanoukville, Cambodia and, instead of working as a bouncer at a nightclub per the ad, was ordered to work with an online criminal ring. For his refusal, he had 1.5 pints of blood drained daily until he finally escaped.</p>
<p>Temptation of Easy Money</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Beijing Youth Daily distributed a meeting with the man, who said he had been trafficked last June subsequent to going to Guangxi, China, because of an advertisement on 58.com looking for a nightclub bouncer.</p>
<p>He said he was then sent to the Cambodian seaside city of Sihanoukville by a group of criminals and later compelled to work for different telemarketing scams. In September, his capturers started extracting his blood after he wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Sihanoukville has lately seen a flood of Chinese venture and movement, predominantly in gambling, which is restricted in mainland China.</p>
<p>The Chinese government office in Cambodia on Thursday, in a statement, gave his last name as Li and affirmed pieces of his story, yet didn’t make reference to 58.com.</p>
<p>It isn’t clear how Li escaped or what online sites he worked for. However, where there’s a single victim of human trafficking, there are others.</p>
<p>58.com Distances Itself</p>
<p>58.com, similar to Craigslist in China, told state media on Thursday it would help out a police investigation in Cambodia despite the fact that it had not determined that the ad had, in fact, been published on its site.</p>
<p>58.com’s reaction to state media turned into a web sensation on Friday, drawing more than 200 million perspectives on Chinese web-based media stage Weibo.</p>
<p>Clients blamed 58.com for a wide scope of untrustworthy practices, from a large number of scams on the platform to the aimless buying and selling of client information.</p>
<p>The organization, in 2020, was taken private by a consortium of financial backers who were upheld by private value firms Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic. The latter is managed by William E. Ford, its chairman and CEO.</p>
