<p>The company confirmed that it will present its Deposit+, Sightline Mobile and Sightline Pay solutions at the 2023 G2E</p>
<p>The leading digital payments provider and developer of mobile apps, powering the betting and online gambling casino sector across the United States, Sightline Payments, announced it will showcase its innovative products at the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) 2023. The fintech company revealed that its latest solutions and products address the current demand and ensure operators are prepared to stay ahead of the growing demand.</p>
<p>One of the important solutions Sightline vowed to showcase at G2E is Deposit+, a new innovation for casino operators that enables them to maximize their cash flow. The solution allows gambling operators to gain access to idle cash that is located within slot machines or TITO kiosks. By leveraging Deposit+, casino operators can reduce their outstanding debt and make more investments without additional debt.</p>
<p>The innovative solution doesn’t have software or hardware requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of operators. Besides maximizing cash flow, the solution allows operators to optimize their drop schedules and at the same time reduce expenses related to labor, resulting in more cost-efficient processing.</p>
<p>Another solution Sightline vowed to present at the upcoming gambling industry event is its Sightline Mobile solution. According to the company, the solution “creates custom-built apps for operators that give their patrons a fully integrated, mobile experience to use across the enterprise, for a one-stop shop for gaming experiences and amenities, all in one convenient app.” This innovative solution can be customized to meet the needs of different operators and it also provides options for analytics along with targeted messages, offers and notifications.</p>
<p>The Innovative Solutions Meet Different Challenges</p>
<p>Sightline Pay is another solution that will be presented at G2E by the leading fintech company. The solution has already proven its effectiveness in the land-based and online gambling sector by offering clients a single digital payment account. This unified solution provides an efficient, secure and seamless method for depositing and withdrawals.</p>
<p>Sightline Pay stands out with FDIC insurance, along with bank-level KYC controls and remote ID, ensuring safe operations. Additionally, according to Sightline, the solution strengthens responsible gambling efforts and enables the operators to make informed decisions related to limits.</p>
<p>“Because the gaming industry is part of the larger entertainment landscape, we must meet patrons where they are and where they are going to ensure that as an industry we are optimally prepared to compete for patrons’ share of wallet.“ Andrew Crowe, SVP at Sightline</p>
<p>Andrew Crowe, Sightline’s SVP, spoke about the constant growth of the global gambling sector. He explained that there’s a constant demand for solutions in the sector, especially when it comes to payments. Finally, Crowe said that the innovative solutions from Sightline address that demand, ensuring that operators can meet the requirements of their players and deliver efficient and safe services.</p>
