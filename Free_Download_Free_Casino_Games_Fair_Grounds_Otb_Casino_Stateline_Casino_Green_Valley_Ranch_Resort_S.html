<p>Markus Antl is Director Global Sales &amp; Key Account Management at Greentube and today he catches up with the Casino Guru News. Antl talks about the company’s North American pivot, with Greentube making waves in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, and also remaining conscious of the need to build a diverse content that strikes a chord with players. Antl goes into the nitty-gritty of the company’s production and decision-making process and offers the inside scoop on how Greentube builds player-favorite games.</p>
<p>Q: Greentube has been enjoying strong global growth. Are there specific markets you are more focused on today and hopeful for the future?</p>
<p>In terms of how we have progressed this year, one of the major highlights has been an increase in demand for our content in Germany, where we have consequently seen a rise in revenues. The driving force behind this trend is that an increasing number of operators are gaining licenses in the country, with our games receiving necessary approvals too. It’s a pleasing trend and one we hope will continue.</p>
<p>Looking further afield, North America continues to be a major focal point for us. Earlier this year we picked up a supplier license for Pennsylvania, adding to New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in terms of states that are currently regulated for online casino. It’s a great market for us, given its hugely significant land-based culture, and we hope to make great strides both in the US and Canada by delivering the type of content players in the region know and love.</p>
<p>Q: Your company has been making noticeable strides all across North America. What makes you feel Greentube is in a good position to resonate with customers in the region?</p>
<p>With licences in place, we have placed a strong emphasis on the creation of new content that will resonate with local audiences in the region. To that end, we embarked on a joint venture with emerging iGaming studio Flamingocatz and also acquired Present Creative, a development studio with a strong track record in the creation of games for both the iLottery and iGaming sectors.</p>
<p>Our plans are to develop content for all four states we have licenses for and we made a major step recently through the launch of Drop The Balls, which is a cross betweenpinball, pachinko and bagatelle,on Washington DC’s lottery. Released through our Greentube USA subsidiary, we believe this iLottery title will be a major success with lotteries and players alike. There will certainly be a lot more content in this area to come.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, you have been releasing slot games that seem to be pulling away from the "mainstream" look and overall feel. Is this the beginning of a new chapter in Greentube product creation?</p>
<p>We are always conscious of the need to cultivate a portfolio that is diverse and which will capture the attention of a wide range of player segments. It simply isn’t enough to generate content and hope that it will suit players in all markets.</p>
<p>We will always lean heavily on our heritage, but at the same time, we understand that not every game will prove to have the lifespan of a Book of Ra, for example. It’s vital that we create games that are focused on attracting different player profiles and that includes providing fresh, original titles. One good example here is Cyber Wildz, a futuristic release with a highly engaging theme and rich features that elevate the experience.</p>
<p>We are also keen to add fresh innovation within past favourites, combining classic elements with innovative mechanics, and showcasing our heritage while pushing the boundaries of online gaming.</p>
<p>On the matter of new products, what is Greentube's game feature that you have been the most proud of so far?</p>
<p>Our Diamond Link feature continues to resonate with audiences worldwide and one implementation we are particularly proud of is within Diamond Link: Cops ‘n’ Robbers. Here, we have blended two iconic Greentube IPs, with the Hold ‘n’ Spin mechanic dovetailing with a board game element which chimes with the playing experience of the land-based favourite.</p>
<p>In this digital version of the game, the robber character Bert is chased across a board during the main feature, with the rewards increasing the longer he can stay away from the chasing police. The chase can end in three ways: by entering the ID Parade where Bert is Busted, when all 15 positions on the reels are filled with Diamond symbols and the Grand Jackpot is awarded, or if the player claims the maximum win of 7000x.</p>
<p>In taking the essence of a timeless classic and adding the Diamond Link treatment, we were able to come up with a product that is familiar, nostalgic and fresh.</p>
<p>How far are you hoping to make it this year and what are your main priorities for 2023?</p>
<p>We are aiming to make continued progress in Europe and North America, by continuing to provide content that strikes a chord with players. Given our recent M&amp;A activity, we believe that we have not only the content creation capabilities but also the technology at our disposal to deliver top-quality content to the market.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with operators across all markets to deliver games to as wide an audience as possible, continuing to innovate while also leaning on past successes that have made our titles so instantly recognisable and popular.</p>
