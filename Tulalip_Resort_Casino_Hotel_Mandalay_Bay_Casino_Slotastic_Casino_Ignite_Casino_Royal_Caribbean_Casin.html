<p>The provider of premium casino games powering the iGaming sector, Red Rake Gaming, forged a new partnership with Spins.lv, a leading online casino operator in Latvia. Announced Tuesday, the new collaboration sees the Latvian operator supercharge its offering by delivering new, engaging and thrilling titles from Red Rake Gaming.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, SPINS' customers in Latvia will benefit from the provider's complete range of leading games. As a result, customers of the operator in the country will be able to access the gambling industry's first "1 million ways to win" range of games, along with action-packed titles with engaging features.</p>
<p>Red Rake Games' content has already gained popularity in different markets across the globe. Now, thanks to the latest deal, the global premium casino games provider will be able to reach even more customers than before, delivering unrivaled experiences and excitement.</p>
<p>Nick Barr, Red Rake Gaming Malta's Managing Director, commented on the topic in a statement, revealing that the company is delighted to ink this new partnership in Latvia and expand its position in the market.</p>
<p>"We have seen a significant growth in the market since our initial launch proving that our myriad of game mechanics and genres are clearly resonating well with Latvian players," he added. Last but not least, Barr pointed out: "We look forward to bringing out games to Spins.lv players and confident our collaboration will be fruitful."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Red Rake Gaming announced a similar collaboration with 7bet for the market in Lithuania. At the time, the provider of premium content agreed to power the operator's offering, delivering quality and engaging games. As a result of the partnership, 7bet's clients in the country gained access to a portfolio of fan-favorite titles from Red Rake Gaming.</p>
<p>While the deal in Lithuania strengthened the operator's offering, it also complemented the expansion of the iGaming content provider. In fact, Red Rake Gaming has been continuously expanding its European footprint, signing multiple partnerships and bringing its games to regulated markets.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the provider's latest deal in Latvia will strengthen the portfolio of games offered by SPINS. The online gambling operator already has established its presence in the country and has been growing since it was founded in 2022 by a team of experts with extensive experience.</p>
<p>After its first year, SPINS was able to acquire a large customer base that continues to grow. In fact, the operator is renowned as the fastest-growing gambling brand in Latvia that offers a wide range of games along with a user-friendly platform.</p>
