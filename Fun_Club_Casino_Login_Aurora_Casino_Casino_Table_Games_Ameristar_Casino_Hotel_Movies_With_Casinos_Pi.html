    <h1>Fun Club Casino Login Aurora Casino Casino Table Games Ameristar Casino Hotel Movies With Casinos Pi</h1>

<p>They do not APPROVE withdrawals and I think that’s because my wins are higher than my loses. On the very day that I processed my deposit of 300PHP (That’s just my strat when I'm new at a certain casino and testing the waters) and after 4hours+ of playing, I won around 9000PHP but, in the end I lose some of that money won and stopped at exactly 7.5K and processed my withdrawal. After a couple of minutes, they rejected it. The day after that, I went in to try again and saw that I have around 90+PHP worth of turnover requirement. i satisfied it firs by playing sicbo and megaball. I won another 600PHP in megaball just by placing a 5PHP bet! It was really good but, I tried to process 1K withdrawal and they approved it. I followed it up with another 3K and they approved it also. The rest are simply a history of REJECTED withdrawals from them. I still got about 4.6K left to withdraw in my wallet and even got that balance down to freaking 3.6K, I was still wining from the Jili provider but, I decided to make a huge ridiculous bet just to pull my balance down in hopes that they’re going to approve my cash out. I waited and communicated with them for days and they’re going to either copy paste their responses or they won’t respond at all! I even went in and deposited another 200PHP even if I still have over 3K in my wallet. I tried looking up their information online to no avail. I also just noticed that the T&amp;C link during the registration process is not even clickable. Wth. I was bored last night and played the same game that won me that amount of money in hopes that the machine won’t give anymore, boy I was wrong. It’s scatter after scatter after scatter. I even gainer all the money that I lost the day I made a ridiculously high bet just to pull down my balance. I even used a desktop pc for the very first time ever. It was really hard but still, I won. I screen record it while actively chatting with a live chat rep (even though she has not responded to me). I was giving them a proof that it’s not my problem that I am winning but the machine itself is just way too generous for my own good. Today, i asked my partner to play on my fone and he managed to drop my winning to 1,591PHP. Process 2 separate withdrawals (1k and 5H) and boom! Got rejected again. Did the same thing from before, I contacted the live chat rep and the moment I gave them my username, they no longer respond to me in any way pr form. Heck, they don’t even read my messages at all. It’s like they read the very first message you sent them and the rest are just a freaking garbage to them. It’s only tagged as "delivered" until you give the f*** up and leave the chat. They’re 100% useless. They shouldn’t be called Customer Service at all because what they do best is screwing up people. I don’t recommend this site, if you do, play at your own risk. But, I tell u right now, you’d end up in the same position as I am right now or maybe not. Who knows right?</p>
<p>Anyway, F*** You, PinasBet! MF scammers!</p>
