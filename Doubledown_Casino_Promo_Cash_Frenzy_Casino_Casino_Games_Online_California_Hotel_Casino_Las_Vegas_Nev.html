<p>Wholly owned subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, theScore Bet, announced today an exclusive partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays designated it as the Official Gaming Partner of the MLB franchise.</p>
<p>First for Both Partners</p>
<p>The 10-year agreement between the Toronto Blue Jays and theScore Bet brings together two prominent Canadian organizations to mark the first sports partnership in the country and offer baseball fans new and exciting ways to enjoy their favorite game at the ballpark, as well as online.</p>
<p>“The fan experience is evolving and this monumental partnership with theScore Bet offers compelling new ways for sports enthusiasts to be a part of the game,” said Toronto Blue Jays president and chief executive officer Mark Shapiro.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be partnering with a Canadian company that operates at the highest level of the industry and understands our role in Toronto and Canada, to bring baseball to more fans nationwide.” Mark Shapiro, President and CEO, Toronto Blue Jays</p>
<p>The historical partnership between both Toronto-based organizations made the Blue Jays the first professional team sponsored by theScore Bet and the sports betting brand the first gaming partner of the MLB outfit.</p>
<p>The landmark deal happened shortly after Ontario had officially launched its regulated sports betting and iGaming market on April 4, and theScore Bet was cleared to operate as an agent of iGaming Ontario. The brand also obtained accreditation from the Responsible Gambling Council.</p>
<p>Exclusive Marketing Rights Across Gaming</p>
<p>Under the terms of the sponsorship deal, theScore Bet is granted the exclusive marketing rights of the Blue Jays nationwide, extending to all gaming categories, including sports betting, casino, online casino, and fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Further, the Blue Jays and theScore Bet will create a branded, premium sports bar and restaurant at the home of the Blue Jays, Rogers Centre, to operate year-round and serve as an entertainment hub and fan destination.</p>
<p>Commenting on the sponsorship, John Levy, chief executive officer at theScore Bet, outlined the Canadian link between both partners, thrilled to join forces with Canada’s baseball team in a “foundational partnership” with an organization “that is deeply embedded” in the country’s sports culture.</p>
<p>“Teaming with the Blue Jays opens up exciting new exclusive marketing opportunities and brings theScore Bet even closer to a huge audience of passionate and engaged fans, both on-site at Rogers Centre and online across our platforms.” John Levy, CEO, theScore Bet</p>
<p>“With our combined loyal audiences and brand affinity in Ontario, we believe this deal will establish a new standard for team and gaming operator relationships as we pioneer innovative ways to experience and interact with the game,” added Levy.</p>
<p>Also under the partnership, theScore Bet and the Blue Jays will deliver new and exclusive in-stadium and digital offerings to sports fans and bettors, among which two premium seating sections on the baselines, in-stadium branding, in-game features, and team-related experiences.</p>
<p>The deal will designate theScore Bet as the Jays Care 50/50’s presenting partner.</p>
