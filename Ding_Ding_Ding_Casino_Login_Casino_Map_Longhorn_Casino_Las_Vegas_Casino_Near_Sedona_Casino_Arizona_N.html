<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Today I took advantage of a 100% bonus of BGN 25 with a requirement to play x5, ie. BGN 25 deposit and BGN 25 bonus - BGN 50 x BGN 5 - 250 play-off amount.</p>
<p>I won BGN 1,400 and tried to withdraw them, he gave me an error and the amount disappeared from my balance. I wrote to their chat and their employee assured me that the withdrawal was being processed. Withdrawals are usually received immediately, and in rare cases when this is not the case, emails are received and the requested withdrawal is visible in the player's account. But this time there was no email, no requested withdrawal in the account.</p>
<p>I wrote in the chat again and then an employee explained to me that I had another 10.50 to play the bonus, but I refused it (I did not understand how and when) and therefore the entire amount of BGN 1,400 was in the bonus balance and not in the real , and nothing can be done.</p>
<p>Do you think this is right? I think that after there was 10.50 to play the bonus, those 10.50 should be the bonus balance, and the remaining 1389.50 should be in real balance. What do you think? Is this correct on the part of the casino? In other casinos the bonus is a bonus and the remaining amounts are in the real balance.</p>
