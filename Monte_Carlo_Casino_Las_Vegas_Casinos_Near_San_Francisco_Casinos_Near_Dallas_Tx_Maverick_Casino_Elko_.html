    <h1>Monte Carlo Casino Las Vegas Casinos Near San Francisco Casinos Near Dallas Tx Maverick Casino Elko</h1>

<p>Chief operating officer Colleen Birch and chief marketing officer Shane Smith have resigned from their positions with Fontainebleau Las Vegas</p>
<p>Less than one month after the grand opening of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas resort, the latest chapter in the 70-year history of the iconic Fontainebleau brand, chief operating officer Colleen Birch and chief marketing officer Shane Smith have announced their voluntary resignations.</p>
<p>Three High-Profile Exits So Far</p>
<p>The two join the resort’s now former senior vice president of casino operations, Michael Clifford, who made a similar announcement some two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Through a statement issued by a resort representative, Fontainebleau Las Vegas thanked COO Birch and CMO Smith “for their contributions” while wishing them well in the future.</p>
<p>The ex-CMO joined the resort at the start of 2023 thanks to his rich expertise in casino and development which included two years at Witkoff, the real estate company that temporarily owned the unfinished property prior to Fontainebleau Development.</p>
<p>There, the Stanford graduate showcased his skills in development and strategy. Smith was also vice president, marketing &amp; customer experience at The Palazzo at The Venetian and he spent two and a half years as chief of staff and chief marketing officer at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Birch was appointed COO for the resort in November 2022. In the past, she was The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas’ senior vice president of revenue optimization. She also took the position of revenue management director at Fontainebleau Las Vegas for ten months in 2008.</p>
<p>Ushering in “a New Era of Luxury Hospitality”</p>
<p>The $3.7 billion North Strip property with 67 stories is expected to usher in “a new era of luxury hospitality” for Fontainebleau Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The casino spreads across 150,000 square feet and is joined by Savor Fontainebleau Las Vegas’ selection of “delectable restaurants, bars, and cafes, fit for any variety of craving or the most memorable occasions,” vibrant entertainment options and nightlife, and over 3,600 hotel rooms and suites.</p>
<p>The official opening date of the resort “built upon a legacy of sublime beauty, unparalleled service, and timeless design” was set for December 13, 2023, after it obtained the necessary approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>The original concept of the resort was announced in 2005, right after Florida-based developer Jeff Soffer bought the historic Miami Beach property.</p>
<p>Last November, Nevada Gaming Control Board’s chairman, Kirk Hendrick, expressed the Board’s excitement to finally witness the project that has taken two decades to finally come to life.</p>
<p>He added the resort would bring shine and glamour to a part of the Vegas Strip that has not been busy in a while.</p>
