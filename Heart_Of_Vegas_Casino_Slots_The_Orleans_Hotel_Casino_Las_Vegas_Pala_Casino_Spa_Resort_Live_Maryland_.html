    <h1>Heart Of Vegas Casino Slots The Orleans Hotel Casino Las Vegas Pala Casino Spa Resort Live Maryland</h1>

<p>Hello Nick, nice to greet you.</p>
<p>I am verified exactly May 2023. I am going to send you a capture of my deposits which limits me until November 2023 'but I have really deposited money since May 2023 and also the times I have withdrawn which was no problem but they were smaller amounts, 1 win casino doesn't let you withdraw if you are not verified, so that means I am 100% verified.</p>
<p>I accumulated my winnings with 100% real money, I do not play sporting events, roulette, or table games, only a slot machine (I attach a photo of the money when I win the prize), 1win does not use activation bonuses, only cashback for lost money , I have deposited a lot of money, I have lost a lot, I have withdrawn very little and it is the first time that I have been able to win something in a slot machine. I want to clarify something that they don't know because they don't have the ability to save the game history, you can create an account yourself and check it if you want, I'll even save this image that I passed on to a friend.</p>
<p>These would be my visually limited deposits on the page until November 2023. (I am attaching 2 images because it limits me from putting many images)</p>
<p>These have been all my retreats since May 2023. (I am attaching 2 images because it limits me from posting many images)</p>
<p>I understand the 14-day process, but they tell me that they are releasing money that I am going to have to pay and that's how I am, I need to pay for things in my personal life, as you know I took a little risk and it turned out well.</p>
<p>And at the conversation level, I spoke every day precisely, now I see if I have chat history and I attach it, the talk is always about the retirement, they tell me patience, you will have your money or they also tell me you have to wait 48 hours and we will give you more information, 48 hours pass and they tell me cancel and resend and like that, it seems like a circle that never ends, it seems like an excellent 1 win casino, but what happened now left me very surprised, before I even had a problem and they were always trying to solve it, now they are trying avoid me at all costs, they have made me send security emails more than 10 times due to the issue of withdrawals, I did it and no one responded.</p>
