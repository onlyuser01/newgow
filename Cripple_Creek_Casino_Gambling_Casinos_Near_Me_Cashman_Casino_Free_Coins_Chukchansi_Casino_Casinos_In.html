    <h1>Cripple Creek Casino Gambling Casinos Near Me Cashman Casino Free Coins Chukchansi Casino Casinos In</h1>

<p>Players from Germany had always a comfortable situation with regard to online casinos because as a German you are accepted in almost every online casino worldwide with a few exceptions. However, the German gambling market has been largely unregulated until now. But that will change by July 2021 at the latest because then the new State Treaty on Gaming will come into force. As a result, some casinos have already turned their backs on the German market because they cannot or do not want to meet the requirements of the e new State Treaty on Gaming. But there are still hundreds of online casinos that continue to accept German games, of which an estimated half also offer live casino games such as roulette, poker, black jack, baccarat, etc.</p>
<p>Since I hardly ever play the live casino games myself, I unfortunately cannot give any casino recommendations. to be on the safe side, however, there are a few small decision-making aids.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to visit the main page of casino.guru click on the little flag in the upper right corner and set everything to Germany. then click on the "recommended" tab at the top of the page and you will be shown the best online casinos with the highest ratings. another security + is a halfway serious license like "mga" or from the UK Gambling Commission, for example.</p>
<p>hope that helps</p>
