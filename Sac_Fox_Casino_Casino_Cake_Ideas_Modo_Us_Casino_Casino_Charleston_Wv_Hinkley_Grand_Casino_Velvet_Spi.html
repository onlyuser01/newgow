    <h1>Sac Fox Casino Casino Cake Ideas Modo Us Casino Casino Charleston Wv Hinkley Grand Casino Velvet Spi</h1>

<p>On March 18th I made a deposit and happened to have a little luck and hit some good wins. I had over 2000 so I decided to make a withdrawal of 1200. I've been using Bitcoin so I knew that the withdrawal process would be quick, maybe a 2-3 days tops. A week passed and nothing.</p>
<p>On the 29th I decided I better get the rest of my money so I made another request for $500.</p>
<p>I've contacted live support and support @velvetspins email numerous times with the same answer that the casino is having high volumes of withdrawal request and to rest assured that it would be taken care of.</p>
<p>Here it is almost May 1st and they continue to give me reassurance that it will be handled.</p>
<p>What I do t understand is why they continue to take ppls money if they are in fact shut down. That's not very good of them.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
