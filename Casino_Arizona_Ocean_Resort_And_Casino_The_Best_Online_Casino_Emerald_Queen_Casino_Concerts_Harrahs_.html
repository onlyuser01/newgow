    <h1>Casino Arizona Ocean Resort And Casino The Best Online Casino Emerald Queen Casino Concerts Harrahs</h1>

<p>The casino acted in accordance with its terms and conditions that is the fact.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can understand why Sofondaboyz assumed he was playing with real money.</p>
<p>Converting the balance from bonus to real money and still applying the max bet and max win rule only cause trouble because most players are not reading the terms and assume that if the balance is transferred to a real balance account, they are playing with real funds.</p>
<p>Moreover, the policy that essentially forces players to make a withdrawal after the successful conversion of the bonus does not seem logical. Casinos should focus on keeping players engaged and encouraging continued play rather than forcing them to withdraw funds with uncertainty about whether they can deposit them back.</p>
<p>So from this point of view, I am on the Sofondaboyz side.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the case:</p>
<p>The casino acted according to their terms; however, how the bonus works in this casino violates our Fair Gambling Codex.</p>
<p>In such cases, we are trying to convince the casino to reconsider their policy regarding the bonuses and make it more simple in a way where players don't need to read the terms. And if the casino decides to keep things as they are, we close the case as unresolved with status: Against Fair Gambling Codex.</p>
<p>The penalization for such cases is reduced because the casino acted according to their terms; however, these terms are not user-friendly, and many other casinos are handling this situation much better.</p>
<p>I would also suggest the casino make a popup window showing after each bonus conversion, where they inform players that they must withdraw their winnings because rules are still in place and once the money is converted to real balance, most of players would assume that the bonus is finished and they are free to play with their real money.</p>
