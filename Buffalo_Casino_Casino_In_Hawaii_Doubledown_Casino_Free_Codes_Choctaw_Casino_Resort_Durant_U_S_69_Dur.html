    <h1>Buffalo Casino Casino In Hawaii Doubledown Casino Free Codes Choctaw Casino Resort Durant U S 69 Dur</h1>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I don't live in Puerto Rico but in Germany. I couldn't change the country here. So,</p>
<p>I made a deposit of 25 EU via Rapid Deposit on May 25th. It says it hasn't gotten there yet, but it shows as Completed on my bank account. I then contacted the casino and now my deposit is apparently not being accepted because my transaction history says the deposit was an online transfer but my bank statement shows my credit card number. I have contacted them several times and each time I am given a different reason. The support again speaks constantly. So something is wrong there and no one really wants to see where my money went. It has to be found somewhere. Can you help me? Incidentally, this has happened to me recently at 2 other casinos, which then claimed my deposit had not arrived, although I can prove it with my bank statements. And the funds never came back to my account either.</p>
<p>Best regards Tatyana</p>
