<p>The seasoned poker pro became the first winner of the WPT Big One for One Drop</p>
<p>The World Poker Tour (WPT) Big One for One Drop, the first such event for the Tour, supporting the One Drop Foundation’s goal to ensure sustainable access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation for vulnerable communities. The tournament helped attract nearly two dozen seasoned poker players. The event featured a $1 million buy-in and attracted a field of 17 players who helped generate a prize pool of $15,810,000.</p>
<p>Emerging as the winner, the Belarusian professional poker player, Mikita Badziakouski, was able to defeat all 16 opponents to win the event’s grand prize. As the winner of the WPT Big One for One Drop, Badziakouski took home $7,114,500. Moreover, he was designated as the first-ever champion of a WPT Big One for One Drop event.</p>
<p>Notably, the recent poker event attracted seasoned poker professionals, including Fedor Holz, Martin Kabrhel, Stephen Chidwick, WPT Ambassador Phil Ivey as well as Rick Salomon, among others. While six players reached the televised final table, only four of the top players secured a payout.</p>
<p>Ranking second and taking home a $4,663,950 prize was Mario Mosboeck, the footballer who became a professional poker pro. WPT Champion Dan Smith was destined for third place which granted him a $2,806,750 payout. Taking fourth place, Isaac Haxton collected a $1,224,800 prize from the recent tournament. Santhosh Suvarna and WPT Champion Nick Petrangelo were left outside of the winning circle and did not collect a prize.</p>
<p>The Win Marks Badziakouski’s Biggest Title</p>
<p>Alexandre Meunier, One Drop Foundation’s chief marketing and events officer, thanked all of the poker players who participated in the WPT Big One for One Drop event. “The charitable contribution of each buy-in is a tremendous help to progressing our worldwide efforts,” explained Meunier in a statement released by WPT Wednesday.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that the win brought a lot of excitement for Badziakouski. Outlining that it feels great to emerge as the winner, he explained that the tournament win marks the biggest title within his professional career. “I just got lucky in a couple big coolers. That’s how it goes, one of the sides has to get lucky and that was me today,” added Badziakouski.</p>
<p>Adam Pliska, WPT’s CEO, was similarly delighted, explaining that the Tour was thrilled to host its first WPT Big One for One Drop in collaboration with Wynn Las Vegas and the One Drop Foundation.</p>
