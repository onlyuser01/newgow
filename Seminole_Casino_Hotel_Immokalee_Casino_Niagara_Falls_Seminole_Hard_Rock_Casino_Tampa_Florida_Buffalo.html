    <h1>Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Casino Niagara Falls Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Florida Buffalo</h1>

<p>Dear zena5755,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"DEPOSIT BONUS STANDARD WAGERING REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all bonuses must be wagered a minimum of 20 times Slots; 50 times for All Allowed Table Games and Video Poker with 10 x Max Cashout. The maximum withdrawal amount from any Deposit bonus is ten times the face value of the deposit amount. Play in Baccarat, Craps, Roulette and Pai Gow Poker will never count towards wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Prior to making a withdrawal exceeding the deposit, an amount greater than the sum of the deposit + bonus must be available in your account before making a withdrawal exceeding the deposit.</p>
<p>Example: Deposit $300 to receive a $300 bonus. If withdrawing over $300, player must have a balance greater than $600."</p>
<p>"All bonuses are non-cashable and will be removed at the time of withdrawal: e.g, if a player receives a bonus of US$100.00 and later requests a $390.00 withdrawal, the $100.00 bonus will be removed and the withdrawal will total $290. Withdrawal requests made for less than the bonus received will be denied."</p>
<p>"An approved "Manager Withdrawal" represents a portion of your balance that was removed because it was not eligible for withdrawal. This amount could be Bonus funds (which are non-cashable) or because you have exceeded the Maximum Withdrawal Amount on your last bonus, with excess funds removed."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>If your deposit was $115 then $115 x 10 = $1,150.</p>
<p>Rewarded bonus 250% = $287.50</p>
<p>$1,150 - $287.50 = $862.50</p>
<p>Could you please advise which payment method you have opted for to receive your winnings and how much was finally approved?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
