    <h1>1St Jackpot Casino Tunica Golden Gate Hotel And Casino Casino Free Spins Maryland Live Casino In Aru</h1>

<p>I have already mentioned several times that since 2019 many games have been going very badly - everyone should make up their own mind. Surprisingly, there were a lot of updates to the games. Whether that was the corona incident - no idea.</p>
<p>I claim that no one knows the game moonprincess or Rsie of olympus as well as I do. I don't even want to know how many spins I've made in the last 7-8 years, but I dare to bet they come close to a 5-6 digit range. It is not a game that brings you a mega profit with 1 euro stake if you compare it with Jarmin jars.</p>
<p>But it was a game that easily brought you 700-1000 euros. And you could always be surprised when you managed to get the ball full. Especially how you did it.</p>
<p>Brief explanation of the game.</p>
<p>It is a 5 by 5 playing field.</p>
<p>You have 7 different characters, 4 small and 3 large - depending on what you play, they are princesses (moon princess) or gods (rise of olympus). It is one and the same game. Just a different name and different characters - but the same gameplay. On the left you have a ball that is divided into 3 sections - you can fill it if you win with princesses or gods. Once you have filled the ball, the next phase begins - now you have to clear the field. And the 3 princesses or gods will help you. The first changes characters. That means she chooses a small character - never princesses but really the small characters and changes them to one of the 3 remaining characters or princesses. 3 or 3 princesses. 50 to 50 chance that she chooses the princesses.</p>
<p>The 2nd princess places 1-2 wilds on the playing field and 3 princess then removes 2 characters. So you can manage to clear the playing field. Once you have managed that, you have the option to choose from 3 free spins.</p>
<p>Free game 1-4spins with the first princess (she changed characters) -extension +4</p>
<p>Free play 2-5spins with the 2nd princess She bets 1-2 wilds) extension + 3</p>
<p>Free game 3 -8 spins (princess removes 2 characters) Extension +2</p>
<p>In principle, the first one can bring you a lot of coal, the second also works and the third is more likely to clear a playing field, which in turn would bring you extra coal - think 200 times the use.</p>
<p>So far so good - but I've played the game for the last 2 years, even after the updates, where many games got an update.</p>
<p>Now I've really tried what's wrong and found out.</p>
<p>Problem number 1 - there are about 20% fewer large pictures in it than before. From where I know this? In the past you often had 5 pincessines or gods in a line after the spin, this is of course easier if you also get more pictures. now you have to be happy to get such a picture after 1000 spins.</p>
<p>Problem number 2-the actions of the 3 princesses.</p>
<p>The first princess hardly ever gives you pictures, even though there is a 50 to 50 chance, and if too often a bad sign is chosen for the princess.</p>
<p>The 2prinzessin puts the wilds somewhere just not where you need them and princess number 3 actually 90% always takes away the sign that you can help where a wild can form.</p>
<p>Getting the ball full on the left is still not a problem - now the biggest failure of the update occurs.</p>
<p>in the last 2 days i had over 60 times the chance to achieve a free game - that means that the ball was filled.</p>
<p>And do you know when I achieved a free game if you couldn't prevent it. That means so many fields were cleared after the start that even if you made your decision, you had no chance to change the free game.</p>
<p>Example the start of the game lost so many characters by winning that there were only 3 characters left. That means the first princess converts one character into another that is still there - only 2 remain. The wilds that come are only there to make profits and to increase the multiplier. But the last princess takes all 2 anyway sign away, playing field empty!</p>
<p>And if you only get a free game 3-5 times at what feels like 60 times, but 70% of the other options are destroyed by the princesses, by absolutely stupid decisions that really nobody can understand, then the update has unfortunately failed.</p>
<p>Here the game was clearly made worse!</p>
