<p>Pragmatic Play has launched its content with Casinò Lugano, a Swiss-facing iGaming operator. The company is rolling out its products through the online gaming brand, Swiss4Win, which is a prominent player in the local market. Pragmatic Play is already a company that is known to European players in major regulated markets and is one of the most worthwhile developers of online casino content.</p>
<p>More Excellent Content Joins Swiss4Win</p>
<p>Moving forward, Swiss4Win players will have the opportunity to choose from a large selection of excellent games developed by Pragmatic Play, including Wolf Gold, Gates of Olympus, and others. Swiss4Win will offer players other excellent titles, including Peaky Blinders, one of Pragmatic’s best-branded slots.</p>
<p>The opportunity to be teaming up with the casino is important for Pragmatic Play, which has been doubling down its efforts to deploy its portfolio across Europe. The company announced earlier this year that it will create 2,000 jobs in Bulgaria, signalling that it’s expecting a huge spike in demand for its products. Commenting on the most recent partnership, Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the opportunity to work with Casinò Lugano and the Swiss4Win brand:</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano’s extensive history as a land-based casino places it in a unique position as one of the most recognized names in the industry, and we are confident that our award-winning products will deliver even more exceptional experiences to its players online. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>A First for Pragmatic Play in Swiss iGaming Market</p>
<p>Casinò Lugano board member and CEO Paolo Sanvido were equally thrilled at the opportunity. He said that collaboration with Pragmatic Play is a huge milestone for the company and it will definitely be one of the pillars of future operations for the brand and company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pragmatic Play will be available to players in the country for the very first time, something that Sanvido welcomed. Pragmatic Play recently expanded its headquarters in Malta, signalling the company’s dedication to investing in its facilities.</p>
<p>Pariplay has recently also launched with Swiss4Win, seeking to bolster the popular operator’s online casino content. In August, Casinò Lugano struck the same partnership with Wazdan, another prominent operator.</p>
