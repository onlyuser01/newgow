    <h1>Santa Claran Hotel And Casino Espanola New Mexico Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel Casino Harrahs Ak Chin</h1>

<p>RAW Arena will now feature much of its content with Lucky Casino and other B2C brands owned by Glitnor Group</p>
<p>RAW Arena brings a number of innovative games that will be integrated directly with the casinos’ content libraries and allow players to experience brand-new games across the board.</p>
<p>One of the strongest features of the new titles is the SuperSlice and SuperTracks mechanics which are integrated with the games and offer audiences a chance to enjoy innovative and engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>RAW Arena Brings Innovative Games and Features to Glitnor Group</p>
<p>RAW Arena features a number of excellent releases, such as Thor Goes Wild, which includes the SuperStretch mechanic and Rise of Shinobi. There is also Mighty Buffalo SuperSymbols, which features the namesake “SuperSymbols” mechanic as well. Commenting on this opportunity RAW CEO Tom Wood has welcomed this partnership and extolled its significance.</p>
<p>“We are “lucky,” said Wood, in a clear reference to Glitnor Group’s popular casino brand. “Glitnor Group is an amazing partner to work with and our ground-breaking games and unique mechanics will give their brands the tools to differentiate their portfolio in a growing Sea of slot Sameness,” he concluded on a highly positive note.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group head of games Sven De Ward was similarly excited to see RAW bring its products with Lucky Casino. He hailed RAW game studio as an innovator and disruptor and a company that is set to revolutionize online gaming and bring innovative and high-quality games.</p>
<p>We believe that RAW is the perfect partner to bring the latest and greatest gaming experience to our players. Get ready to be blown away. Sven De Ward, head of games, Glitnor Group</p>
<p>RAW Grows Content Reach and Offering with Host of New Partners</p>
<p>RAW has been working hard to secure and expand its content offering. The company recently negotiated a content integration partnership with Jumpman Gaming, a progressive and innovative white-label network. Before that, the company confirmed that it will be bolstering Betsson Group’s content by bringing its full list of titles with the prominent company and its brands.</p>
<p>RAW similarly launched with White Hat Gaming in early April and has been on the lookout to add more suppliers to its own aggregation platform with Green Jade Games most recently.</p>
