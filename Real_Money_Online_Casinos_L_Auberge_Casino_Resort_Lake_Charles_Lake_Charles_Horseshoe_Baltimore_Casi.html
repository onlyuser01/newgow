    <h1>Real Money Online Casinos L Auberge Casino Resort Lake Charles Lake Charles Horseshoe Baltimore Casi</h1>

<p>I deposit 50€ to play with the first bonus deposit. When I finished the wagering, my balance was 955€. I played only(!) one spin by accident with 2,40€, when my balance was around 850€ and the wagering was near 60-70%. I repeat ONE spin by accident because I played by my phone. (The maximum allowed bet is 2€) When I made a withdrawal after I asked the support to tell me if everything is ok, the next day the withdrawal cancelled and my balance was at first 0€ and then 50€ from 955€.</p>
<p>They told me that I exceeded the maximum allowed bet for the bonus wagering and my last deposit was returned to my gaming balance.</p>
<p>I feel that they stole me. This is so unfair.</p>
<p>I need your help because I made everything right and I can't believe that this one spin really affected something.</p>
<p>(I have screenshots of everything.)</p>
