<p>Lucky Lightning review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around Greek mythology.</p>
<p>On a stormy night, players will make their way to a majestic temple and meet a host of magical beings. Keeping Zeus, king of the gods, happy will be essential to completing this quest.</p>
<p>This is a good game for mythology lovers and fans of historical slots. The fantasy vibe and epic setting help make this game intriguing.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The rock-infused soundtrack brings to mind the action sequence of a vintage adventure film. Occasional rumbling thunder adds extra tension and keeps the atmosphere stormy.</p>
<p>The backdrop behind the reels shows a night-time landscape with the white pillars of a temple visible in the distance. Lightning flashes in the moonlit sky, illuminating fluffy clouds. The setting seems both enchanted and slightly intimidating.</p>
<p>Beside the reels, Zeus looks on, leaving no doubt that he is in control of every bolt of lightning. Other mythical characters also appear on the reels, including the iconic Minotaur and Pegasus. Finally, an aloof goddess peers out at players, her head adorned with gems.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create an enchanting ancient world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Lucky Lightning is a five reel, three row slot, but special features may expand the size of the reels (see details below).</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels going from left to right.</p>
<p>The gameplay feels swift and smooth, so players won’t have trouble staying engaged.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus and Money symbols. The Wild symbol appears only on reels 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The Money symbols come in three types, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, which entail different levels of prizes.</p>
<p>If players land a Wild symbol on reel 1 as well as on reel 2, the reels have a random chance of expanding to a variety of sizes for the current spin. Should this expansion add reel 6, this reel will only contain Money symbols.</p>
<p>Once players collect their winnings, the Money symbols will stay locked into their place on the reels. Players have a respin after which any Money symbols adjacent to Wild symbols in reels 1 and 2 create a left-to-right payline and players collect the total prize.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. Depending on the number of Bonus symbols that land, players will be awarded a greater number of free spins:</p>
<p>3 Bonus symbols=10 free spins</p>
<p>4 Bonus symbols=15 free spins</p>
<p>5 Bonus symbols=50 free spins</p>
<p>Players always begin the Free Spins feature with a grid of 3x6 symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.45%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility mythology-themed slot.</p>
<p>With slick gameplay, attractive animation, and strategy-friendly volatility, this game is a great choice.</p>
<p>The immersive stormy setting and ample bonus features also help keep this slot engaging.</p>
