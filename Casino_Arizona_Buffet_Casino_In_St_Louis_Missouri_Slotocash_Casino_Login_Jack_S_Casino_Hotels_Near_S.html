<p>Q: Gamdom uses a Provably Fair algorithm. Can you tell our readers how this works and why it matters for players?</p>
<p>It refers to a system or mechanism that allows users to verify the integrity of the game's outcome and confirm that the results were not manipulated or biased in any way.</p>
<p>Traditionally, in offline or centralized gambling establishments, players have to trust that the casino or platform is conducting their games fairly. In a provably fair system, cryptographic algorithms and mathematical proofs are used to ensure that game results are fair and random. It allows players to independently verify fairness by examining the algorithms, seeds, and relevant data used in the game.</p>
<p>Here's how a provably fair system typically works:</p>
<p>Step 1: Seed Generation</p>
<p>The system kicks things off by generating a random seed. Think of it as the starting point for the whole random number generation process.</p>
<p>Step 2: Player's Seed</p>
<p>The player is granted the ability to input their own seed. This feature empowers them with control over the progression of the game, as it truly puts the player in charge of the element of randomness.</p>
<p>Step 3: Game Round</p>
<p>Whether it's a dice roll or a card draw, the game takes place using the seeds we talked about earlier. The outcome of the game is determined based on these seeds.</p>
<p>Step 4: Verification</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of the game, you will not be left uninformed. You will have access to the utilized seed and algorithms, allowing you to verify fairness. Take charge by running the inputs through the algorithms or utilize convenient third-party tools - the choice is yours!</p>
<p>By allowing players to verify the fairness of each outcome, provably fair systems provide a higher level of transparency and trust in online gambling and gaming platforms. It helps protect players from potential manipulation and ensures a more enjoyable and trusted gaming experience.</p>
<p>Q: There is a lot of talk about blockchain in the crypto casino industry, but isn't it that crypto casinos today do not really use blockchain to run the majority of their operations?</p>
<p>While blockchain technology has been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency casino industry, crypto casinos today do not really use blockchain to run the majority of their operations. Blockchain is used primarily for anti-money laundering and fraud detection purposes as well as handling transactions between players and casinos.</p>
<p>Q: How do you seeGamdom’s position in the fastly-changing market as global regulators are strengthening consumer protection?</p>
<p>AtGamdom, we prioritize staying updated with regulations worldwide. We consistently review and enhance our internal policies, procedures, and systems to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. This commitment enables us to meet evolving requirements and uphold the industry’s best practices, creating a safe and equitable gaming environment for our players.</p>
<p>As the market evolves, Gamdom remains dedicated to adapting to changes that enhance player protection, transparency, and overall integrity. By staying at the forefront of regulatory developments and prioritizing consumer protection, we solidify our position as a trusted and responsible provider in the rapidly changing global market.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think the biggest change in the crypto gaming space will be over the next few years?</p>
<p>In the coming years, we anticipate the crypto gaming space undergoing a significant transformation, primarily driven by increased global regulation and the harmonization of policies. Governments and regulatory agencies are now acknowledging cryptocurrencies as assets, leading to a greater allocation of resources for monitoring and control. As blockchain-based technology and associated financial transactions become more widespread, we can expect a rise in scrutiny and oversight to ensure compliance with regulations. This shift towards a regulated market will instil greater stability and confidence in the crypto gaming industry, fostering a safer and more secure environment for both players and operators.</p>
