<p>New Orleans Saints vs. Minnesota Vikings Week 10 game is on the program on Sunday, November 12, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis</p>
<p>Minnesotaâ€™s new quarterback Joshua Dobbs did very well on his debut, helping the Vikings grab a come-from-behind win over the Atlanta Falcons. Heâ€™s expected to start in Week 10, but thereâ€™s worry whether he can repeat the same.</p>
<p>Online bookmakers seem to think he wonâ€™t do much against the New Orleans Saints. Itâ€™s not only because they have no trust in Dobbs; itâ€™s also because bookies seem to trust NOLAâ€™s defense, which is currently seventh in the league.</p>

<p>New Orleans Saints Offense Needs to Keep Going</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are 5-4 on the season, which isnâ€™t great, but theyâ€™ve got only themselves to blame. Even though they did very well against tough opponents like the New England Patriots and the Tennessee Titans, theyâ€™ve also lost to some underdogs.</p>
<p>For example, their most recent away loss happened against the Houston Texans, who are one of the worst teams in the league. The reason why they lost is that their Derek Carr-led offense didnâ€™t do great in that game.</p>

<p>In fact, the biggest problem for the Saints in 2023 has been their inconsistent offense. Their average is 21.7 points per game, which is better than half of the teams in the NFL. However, five of their nine games in the 2023 season saw them score no more than 20 points.</p>
<p>Their defense, on the other hand, has been brilliant constantly. These guys are allowing only 19.0 per game, which makes them the NFLâ€™s seventh-best defense. But will they be able to stop Joshua Dobbs and the Vikings on November 12?</p>
<p>All Eyes on Minnesotaâ€™s QB Joshua Dobbs</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings are Joshua Dobbsâ€™ sixth NFL team. The 28-year-old has been in the league since 2017 but has made only 17 appearances in total. One of those was in the Vikings at Falcons game last weekend, in which he came on the field after Jaren Hall suffered a concussion.</p>

<p>Despite not starting the game, Dobbs was by far the most impressive player. He threw for two touchdowns and scored one rushing touchdown on his own. Knowing this, itâ€™s no surprise thereâ€™s a big Dobbs hype in Minnesota right now.</p>
<p>But how long will it last? He had an inspiring performance against Atlanta, but the thing is that the Falcons just arenâ€™t good defensively. At least not as good as the Saints.</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints vs. Minnesota Vikings Prediction</p>
<p>The Saintsâ€™ defense is great in 2023 and we think these guys will prove it in Week 10 by stopping Dobbs &amp; Co. from scoring too many points. At the same time, we expect New Orleansâ€™ offense to shine on Sunday. There are some really good players on NOLAâ€™s offensive team, they just need to click. And the Saints at Vikings Week 10 game looks like a perfect opportunity for that.</p>
