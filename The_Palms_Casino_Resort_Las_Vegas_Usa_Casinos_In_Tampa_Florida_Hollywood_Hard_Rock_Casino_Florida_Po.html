    <h1>The Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Usa Casinos In Tampa Florida Hollywood Hard Rock Casino Florida Po</h1>

<p>Dear Viliam &amp; Jose,</p>
<p>Hope you're doing well!</p>
<p>So on Mar-6th when we checked your (Jose's) account there was no problems with it and we asked you to get in touch with us if you face any issues in terms of raising the withdrawal. We observed that you raised a withdrawal request on 7th then cancelled it and then raised it again on Mar-8th. However you also redeemed another free chip and played on it and that made you ineligible to withdraw on the first free chip you were playing on. Because as per the rules mentioned on the website: Free Chips cannot be used in succession by the Player. If a player redeems a free chip, regardless if the offer was sent to the Player via the Casino or they redeemed it via Customer Support, they cannot redeem a second Free Chip and be eligible for a withdrawal on that Free Chip’s winnings. It is the sole responsibility of the Player to ensure they are following the Free Chip rules. Withdrawals will be denied at the approval stage with the Payments team if this rule is broken. In case a Player uses a coupon or a promotional offer that they aren’t eligible for use, all and any winnings created from that promotion are forfeited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since you played on back to back free chips, your withdrawal was cancelled. However if you wish to deposit and play, please feel free to get in touch and we will be more than happy to assist you.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Support Team</p>
