<p>Hacksaw Gaming has just unlocked a major milestone in its history, having successfully secured a supplier license in West Virginia, the United States. This is the company’s first US entry, and it Hacksaw Gaming hopes – not the last. The provisional license will allow the firm to secure a foothold in the burgeoning iGaming market in the country and North America in general.</p>
<p>Hacksaw Gaming has created a number of excellent titles, including Undead Fortune, Break Bones, Alpha Eagle, Pug Life, and so many others. The company has a distinct art and design style that is best captured by titles such as Born Wild, OutlawsInc, and Time Spinners, among others.</p>
<p>Company CEO Marcus Cordes welcomed the opportunity to break ground in the United States and confirmed that this license was "the beginning of a significant expansion in the country." Hacksaw is already present in Ontario since May this year, and it’s only natural that the company is now pivoting towards the United States which has an untapped online casino potential.</p>
<p>The launch on US markets will be facilitated by Light &amp; Wonder and is expected to happen in the first quarter of 2023. Cordes noted that Hacksaw Gaming has so far been able to expand in multiple jurisdictions this year, including earlier forays into Isle ofMan and Romania, both of which were important to the firm. He added:</p>
<p>"Being granted this license is testimony to the quality of our games portfolio and shows just how robust and engaging our content is."</p>
<p>The company is absolutely pleased to have unlocked Western Virginia and while some time will pass before the first games appear with actual operators, Hacksaw has secured its competitive future in iGaming. Company SVP of Compliance North America Christine Bordeaux said that the firm already has an exciting strategy for the further expansion of the brand’s games and products in new markets.</p>
<p>Hacksaw’s products have already been deemed as worthy by players, state, and privateoperators, and even competitors. Following on its entry in Ontario, the company recently signed a partnership with Loto-Québec and will be adding slot games to the province owned operator, which is also competing against private companies in a bid to secure a bigger number of participations.</p>
