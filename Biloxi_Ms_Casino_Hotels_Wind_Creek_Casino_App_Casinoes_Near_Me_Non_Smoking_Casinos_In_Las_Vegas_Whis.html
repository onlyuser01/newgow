<p>The 2023 Peach Bowl – #11 Ole Miss Rebels vs. #10 Penn State Nittany Lions – will take place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday, December 30.</p>
<p>The 2023 Peach Bowl brings us the first-ever duel between the Ole Miss Rebels and the Penn State Nittany Lions. This, however, isn’t the only interesting fact about the college bowl game played in Atlanta on December 30.</p>
<p>The 2023 Peach Bowl is also great for the fact that these two are very similar in terms of player quality. The Rebels are ranked No. 11 in the nation, while the Nittany Lions are seen as the 10th-best college football team right now. This explains why the Ole Miss vs. Penn State odds are relatively close with the Rebels being four-point underdogs at the moment.</p>

<p>Ole Miss Looking to Break Some Program Records in the 2023 Peach Bowl</p>
<p>The Ole Miss Rebels finished the regular season with a 10-4 record, and now have a chance to win their 11th game of the season. If they do it, 2023 is going to be the season with the most wins in this program’s history.</p>
<p>Judging by the 2023 Peach Bowl odds, they’re not expected to do so. However, there are some things that are giving them confidence. They’re a well-rounded team that’s doing equally well offensively and defensively.</p>
<p>Plus, these guys seem to love playing big games, the evidence being that they’ve already defeated a couple of tough opponents this season, most notably, LSU. The man they have to thank for this the most is their coach, Lane Kiffin.</p>
<p>This is his fourth season in charge of Ole Miss and in each of those he led the Rebels to a bowl game. His record as the Ole Miss boss is 33-15, while in the four seasons before his arrival, the Rebels were 20-28.</p>
<p>All Eyes on Penn State’s Defense</p>
<p>Penn State is the third defense in the nation, conceding just 11.8 points per game on average. Their standout player this season has been Adisa Isaac, a defensive end, who’s one of the Nittany Lions’ six captains.</p>
<p>Penn State’s Adisa Isaac hasn’t decided whether he’ll return for another season, but he will be participating in the Peach Bowl against Ole Miss.</p>

<p>Although he’s expected to move elsewhere (probably in the NFL) during the offseason, Isaac has confirmed he’ll be playing in the 2023 Peach Bowl. The same goes for most of his teammates who were key for taking Penn State to 10-2 this season.</p>
<p>Their offense isn’t as impressive as their defensive team, but their young quarterback Drew Allar definitely has the potential to grow into a real world-beater.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old has thrown for 2,336 yards and 23 touchdowns this season, getting just one of his passes intercepted. That’s a great achievement for a sophomore QB, but truth be told, he hasn’t played against too many great defenses this season, excluding the Michigan Wolverines, who are the No. 1 defense in the nation.</p>
<p>However, against the Wolverines, we saw Allar do better than expected. Not only did he throw for one touchdown, but he also scored one rushing TD.</p>
<p>Ole Miss vs. Penn State 2023 Peach Bowl Prediction</p>
<p>We think Penn State is much better defensively than Ole Miss, which is what could be the decisive factor. If they stop the Rebels’ offense from scoring too many TDs, Allar and his teammates should be able to do just enough to win the 2023 Peach Bowl for Penn State.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean we expect them to cover the spread. We think it’s very likely this bowl game will be decided by a single field goal.</p>
<p>Pick: Penn State</p>
