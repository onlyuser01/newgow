    <h1>Double Casino Buffalo Creek Casino Allentown Casino James Bond Casino Royale Cast Bethlehem Casino M</h1>

<p>I rarely play online but last year in March stumbled across MrSloty, I had a successful withdrawal of £200 in a few days.</p>
<p>then in May I played again and had another successful withdrawal of £1100 all be it took a little longer - more like 10 days. However during this time the casino was in regular contact via my VIP manager Mitch.</p>
<p>I played again in November and after a few deposits I made a withdrawal on 18th December 2023 for £5000</p>
<p>since making the withdrawal I have been unable to get hold of anyone via email. The website changed names/domains to Mrsloty1.com instead of MrSloty. The chat keep closing my conversations down and my status fo withdrawal still remains as "awaiting" "user request"</p>
<p>they have said 21 business days - first time I have had this and they will not tell me why. Phone number on the site doesn’t work.</p>
<p>think I have been scammed looking at all the reviews now. Feel stupid.</p>
<p>please help. Verified account for over a year. Not played with a bonus.</p>
