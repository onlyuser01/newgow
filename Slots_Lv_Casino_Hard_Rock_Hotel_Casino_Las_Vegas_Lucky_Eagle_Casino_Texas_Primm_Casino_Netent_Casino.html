<p>Française des Jeux, the operator of France’s national lottery games, has inked an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain, a top-level French soccer club. As per the agreement, Française des Jeux’s brands will be named as PSG’s official partners.</p>
<p>FDJ’s ParionsSports Brands Become PSG’s Partners</p>
<p>The three-year partnership will see Paris Saint-Germain work together with FDJ’s ParionsSport’s retail and online brands. Until 2025, the two betting brands will serve as the soccer team’s official premium partners.</p>
<p>As PSG’s partner, ParionsSport en ligne, FDJ’s online arm, has agreed to post exclusive sports content across its social channels. The agreement will allow the brand to offer exclusive contests through which participants can win tickets for PSG’s live matches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ParionsSports point de vente, FDJ’s retail brand, will promote the sports club and its games through its numerous shops across the country. PerionsSports shops near Parc des Princes, the soccer club’s home stadium, will offer exclusive betting products on select matches.</p>
<p>Both brands will incorporate PSG’s branding and will use it for marketing purposes. The team’s logo will have a strong presence on PSG’s social media channels during the upcoming French championship season.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Happy to Provide Sports Fans with New Experiences</p>
<p>Richard Courtois, chief executive officer of FDJ’s sports business unit, addressed the partnership with the famous soccer club. He noted that his team is happy to work with a soccer club as popular and successful as Paris Saint-Germain. This will be the first time FDJ has worked with PSG and Courtois is looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Courtois also added that the three-year partnership will cement Française des Jeux as a major force in French sports betting. This, in turn, will allow the company to engage fans with unique sports betting experiences.</p>
<p>Courtois concluded that his company will approach the partnership with responsibility and enthusiasm. This way, it will ensure premium experiences for the whole PSG fanbase.</p>
<p>Marc Armstrong, chief partnerships officer for PSG, confirmed that the club shares Courtois’ sentiments. He welcomed Française des Jeux into the Paris Saint-Germain family and lauded the company as a “major player” in the sports betting sector.</p>
<p>Armstrong said that he can’t wait to bring innovative and safe sports betting experiences to fans of the team.</p>
<p>FDJ’s ParionsSports recently unveiled a new campaign in collaboration with the French Tennis Federation. The two companies vowed to #smashthehaters and protect professional sports players from harassment on the Internet.</p>
<p>Earlier, FDJ teamed up with Sportradar in a deal that saw the supplier power the French operator with unique sports video highlights.</p>
