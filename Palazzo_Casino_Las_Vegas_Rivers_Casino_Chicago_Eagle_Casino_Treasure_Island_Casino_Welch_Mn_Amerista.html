    <h1>Palazzo Casino Las Vegas Rivers Casino Chicago Eagle Casino Treasure Island Casino Welch Mn Amerista</h1>

<p>RichPrize Casino did accept me while in their T&amp;C there is showing the following:</p>
<p>5.2. For various legal or commercial reasons, We do not permit new accounts to be opened by customers resident in certain jurisdictions, including the Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, France, Netherlands, Spain, Saba, Statia, St Martin, USA or other restricted jurisdictions ("Restricted Jurisdiction") as communicated by Us from time to time. ( ......)</p>
<p>5.2.1. By using the Website, You confirm You are not a resident in a Restricted Jurisdiction. If You open or use the Website while residing in a Restricted Jurisdiction: Your Player Account may be closed by Us immediately; any Winnings and Bonus Funds will be confiscated and any remaining Deposit Funds (except for any Winnings) will be returned to You on request subject to these Terms and any legal or regulatory obligations with which We are required to comply. ( ..... )</p>
<p>RichPrize Casino did allow me to register from the above jurisdiction (Netherlands), this is also not allowed by local laws since 1 October 2021 in the Netherlands. Operator does needs to have a license from the Dutch Kansspelautoriteit (dutch gambling authority) which they allow them to offer their services in the Netherlands. The operator does not have that.</p>
<p>I did sent them the following email:</p>
<p>Please close my account asap, offering your services to me as (dutch) residents located/living in the Netherlands is not allowed by local laws since 1 October 2021, if you don't have a Dutch Kansspelautoriteit license which you don't have.</p>
<p>I do also see that you are using fake Pragmatic Play slots, the slots of Pragmatic Play are hosted on RichPrize Casino on https://games.pragmaticplay.dev/ while the original and authorized slots are hosted on a different domain. If I do compare it with a reliable website licensed by the MGA or UK Gambling Commission or Dutch Gambling Authority the slots of Pragmatic Play are hosted on <strong><em>license holder</em></strong>.pragmaticplay.net/ which are original and authorized.</p>
<p>''Game History'' button in the slot is working on the original websites.</p>
<p>''Game History'' button at your slots at RichPrize Casino is not working.</p>
<p>I have also been charged more than I initially agreed to on the website.</p>
<p>Asked for my account to be closed due to the above, and my deposits to be fully refunded. They declined my request with the following message:</p>
<p>"Dear Player,</p>
<p>Please, note that our decision to refuse the requested refund and to permanently block your account remains in effect.</p>
<p>Whenever you decide to register at a particular online gaming resource, you have to accept its terms and conditions what you actually did when registered with our website.</p>
<p>It is solely your responsibility to provide complete, consistent and truthful personal information, which you failed to do upon registration, namely you did not inform us about your self-exclusion.</p>
<p>We respect the national laws and therefore we do not accept customers who are prohibited by national law to get services in other jurisdictions and who neither accept our Terms and</p>
<p>Conditions nor agree to be treated as a legal customer/purchaser as defined by the relevant Laws and Regulations. When accepting the customers who wants to get entertained, relax with our top offers, we give the priority to the customerâ€™s decision and his choice unless the customer has self-excluded himself or he is below the minimum legal age for our services.</p>
<p>The onus is on the consumer to check all the rules and terms before you register and you should make sure you clearly understand the rules and consent to recognize yourself as a legal customer of certain entertainment shop before you buy its services. By registering and thus accepting our T&amp;C (and furthermore by bypassing our registration checks to avoid being recognized as a self-excluded person) you have declared yourself a legally acceptable customer. Please, note that none of our rules stipulates the refund cases and no one rule of the Law providing the refunding is applicable in your case.</p>
<p>Please, be reminded that none of your rights have been violated. The services provided to you</p>
<p>were in full compliance with the rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Due to the above we decline your refund request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Customer Support"</p>
<p>The above text is just a standard message, I did not have a self exclusion at RichPrize Casino. And I did indeed provide valid information, registration was from Dutch IP and possible.</p>
<p>Deposits by credit card were also possible from the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Operator did also offer fake/ counterfeit slots where I do have proof of, they did not reply on that.</p>
<p>Operator also charged more than agreed to, operator did also not replied on that.</p>
<p>It would be fair, if the deposits would get refunded.</p>
