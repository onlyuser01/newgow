    <h1>Santa Ana Hotel And Casino War Horse Casino Zone Casino Msn Casino In Livingston Niagara Resort And</h1>

<p>I just saw casino guru has given Ltc casino another week!!</p>
<p>I have now lost total faith.</p>
<p>I would understand if the casino would have provided proves aganist me, anc im talking about real proves.</p>
<p>The casino has stated they won't pay and they fail to provide evidence.</p>
<p>Since they have refused to pay my winnings or even refused to refund my deposits as at this point I would have been happy to even wak out with my own deposits and cut my losses and learn to don't trust reviews but to trust only players reviews.</p>
<p>For me the case is close as they have refuse to pay me ,they lied publicly and casino guru comfirmed that my gameplay had healthy breaks.</p>
<p>If the casino has issues with the game provider should apologies to me and then state that my side is clean.</p>
<p>instead they lied about me and then attack the game provider.</p>
<p>If they can prove there is bugs in the slot which would have nothing to do with me it would have been another story as that would have been our of control.</p>
<p>But they came out with the bugs story only when there was not proves aganist me. And what this has to do with me?</p>
<p>If they had the decency of not lying about me it would have been different.</p>
<p>I'm innocent and I feel like I'm screaming in death ears.</p>
<p>In my eyes they stolen my deposits and my winnings.</p>
<p>I feel very upset the casino is still able to cheat people because at the end of the day people like me trust casino guru reviews and I feel rhe review is not true, they are not honest.</p>
<p>If they want to show their honesty they can pay or give real evidence and not fabricated lies.</p>
<p>If I was a cheated would I have gone through a this hell and back?</p>
<p>Honestly!!</p>
