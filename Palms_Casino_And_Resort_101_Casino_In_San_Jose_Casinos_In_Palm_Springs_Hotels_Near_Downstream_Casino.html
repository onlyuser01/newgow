    <h1>Palms Casino And Resort 101 Casino In San Jose Casinos In Palm Springs Hotels Near Downstream Casino</h1>

<p>In 2017 I created an account in this casino and due to my addiction to online gambling I closed it permanently and indefinitely (so I expressed it in the emails sent)</p>
<p>My surprise is that since that time these people have taken advantage of my addiction problem by letting me reopen the account on several occasions knowing that I am sick.</p>
<p>Today I have recovered the emails from that time and my lawyer has asked me to contact them or we will denounce them before the dgoj and the competent authority.</p>
<p>I enclose all the information as well as the final closure request and the confirmation of said closure by the same casino.</p>
<p>I request any and all deposits made since February 14, 2017</p>
<p>I have more captures but it won't let me upload them by size</p>
<p>thanks help me please</p>
