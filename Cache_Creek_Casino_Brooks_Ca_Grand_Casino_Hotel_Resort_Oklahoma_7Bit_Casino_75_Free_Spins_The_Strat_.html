    <h1>Cache Creek Casino Brooks Ca Grand Casino Hotel Resort Oklahoma 7Bit Casino 75 Free Spins The Strat</h1>

<p>Dear Rafe,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience with Mad Rush Casino.</p>
<p>Please understand, that the variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, contracts with the payment providers, and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits, it doesn’t mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too, also it can be discontinued at any time. Unfortunately, casinos are sometimes powerless and limited in offering payment methods to their customers.</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that the transaction that initially indicated a 'completed transaction' was not successful?</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have been informed about any alternative method to withdraw your winnings?</p>
<p>Was your account verified successfully in the past?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
