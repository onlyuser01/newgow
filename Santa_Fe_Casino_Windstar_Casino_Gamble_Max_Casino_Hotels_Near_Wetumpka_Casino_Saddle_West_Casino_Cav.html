<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers have released a new GameDay+ experience featuring the Cavs Pick ‘Em prediction game that offers free participation and real cash rewards.</p>
<p>Cavs Pick ‘Em Live Game Now Available to Cavaliers Fans</p>
<p>As NBA franchises are looking to capitalize on the sports betting market, the Cleveland Cavaliers have hurried up to introduce their own dedicated GameDay+ experience, a dedicated predictive platform that is part of the Cavs App Championed by Westfield and that will lead to more synergies between traditional sport and the sports betting experience.</p>
<p>The GameDay+ experience now comes with a free-to-play LIVE predictive game known simply as Cavs Pick ‘Em. The premise is simple – fans receive awards based on whether they have successfully predicted what happens during a game in real-time.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the Cavs Pick ‘Em is a live betting experience with the added benefit of playing for free. According to the official press release, the game will also test fans IQ by seeing if Cavaliers loyalists can successfully predict developments during a game.</p>
<p>Bet on Pre-Game, Live and Props Outcomes</p>
<p>While the game is available for free, players can still get numerous cash prizes, including a $1,000 jackpot for each game. Other perks include the Cavs Team Shop gift cards, autographed sports paraphernalia, game-worn jerseys and more.</p>
<p>Players will get prediction questions in the pre-game and then during the first and second half of the game. The questions will vary and they will be predicated on a sports betting experience, the press release suggests.</p>
<p>Some of the questions will ask about what the most likely outcome of a game is or be a little more player-specific. For example, you may be asked “how many points will the Cavaliers score tonight” or “which of these players will reach 25 points first?”</p>
<p>The GameDay+ experience will make sure that it remains varied, challenging and highly-rewarding to Cleveland Cavaliers fans. Meanwhile, the team’s app may be downloaded for both Android and iOS</p>
