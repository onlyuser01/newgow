    <h1>Eureka Casino Resort Primm Valley Casino Resorts Remington Casino Real Casino Online For Real Money</h1>

<p>I signed up with Jupi since i saw adds on what i thought was reliable casino sajts. Those sajts has adds for refuel casino, mount gold, winners among others i played at and never had any problem.</p>
<p>So started to play and won 10 000 euro and the Jupi casino verified my account and said that all documents were approved. When trying to withdraw I was only allowed to withdraw 500 euro and not make another withdraw until the first 500 was approved and paid. I made my withdraw and after 2 - 3 days i got an email telling me my account was not verified and that i needed to send in another ID. I had huge problem to get the right size on my pdf but managed to get pictures of my passport uploaded. Since i didnt get any answer from Jupii went in and played another round and won 15 000 euro so my account was now on 25 000 euro. But to give you a time frame on the 24 th of february I won the first 10 000 and I sent in a bunch of documents and the casino has stopped me from being able to withdraw and refuses to give me a timeline in when KYC will approve my passport. This was the last email i received from Jupi support:</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your withdrawal has been cancelled by the payments department and the amount is available in your account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the withdrawal option on your account has been temporarily suspended and your account shall be reviewed by the relevant department for security reasons.</p>
<p>We kindly request your patience as we are not able to provide you with an exact time-frame.</p>
<p>Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience and thank you for helping us maintain a high level of security.</p>
<p>It is a shame that players are getting robbed on their money and dreams from a company operated by Famagousta BV who runs SupaCasi Casino, OhMyZino Casino, Lucy's Casino, Divas Luck Casino</p>
<p>and Jupi casino and my guess is that no one e´ver get the´ir winnigs paid. If this doesnt help me get my money then i can only wish that other players see this and keep their money and choose to play at serious casinos.</p>
