<p>The “It’s Alive!” global marketing campaign is finally available on TV and digitally in the United Kingdom at a time of fast-evolving rules on gambling advertisement in the first place. The TV spot is set around the idea of mad scientists trying to bring Frankenstein-like monsters to life and is designed to boost awareness for SkillOnNet’s live casino and gameshow products that are available at PlayOJO.</p>
<p>It’s Alive! – PlayOJO’s Latest Marketing Campaign Hits the UK</p>
<p>The spot sees the monster come to life once they experience the PlayOJO live casino, which runs current through it and brings it back. All of this is done in beautiful CGI that does the brand credit. The advertisement is developed by Isobel, a creative agency based in London and kicking off on June 30 in the United Kingdom. More markets are set to follow this summer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, PlayOJO has been maintaining a robust reputation for being a fair and worthwhile casino all across. Among its many advertisement campaigns, PlayOJO has not just promoted fairness, but its own signature phrases such as “feel the fun,” which has become synonymous with the brand.</p>
<p>Feel the Fun was actually launched last July 2022 and became one of the company’s signature marketing initiatives worldwide. PlayOJO CMO Peter Bennett said commenting on this new opportunity and campaign:</p>
<p>We want PlayOJO to be the first choice for players looking to enjoy the thrill and excitement of a live casino experience online and are therefore very excited to launch our new integrated campaign showcasing the fun and vibrancy of our live casino product. PlayOJO CMO Peter Bennett</p>
<p>PlayOJO has been building its reputation as one of the leaders in entertainment, delivering impeccable gaming products. One of the brand’s strengths has been the deployment of excellent live casino games, such as Mega Wheel, Crazy Time, and Monopoly Live. PlayOJO has been awarded as one of the most innovative casinos when it comes to the use of social media to promote its branding and products.</p>
