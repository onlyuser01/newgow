<p>Australian gambling company Tabcorp and Lottoland, the national online lottery operator, have been awarded 20-year licenses by the Victoria State Government to offer keno games in the jurisdiction. Lottoland Australia and Tabcorp may launch keno products starting on April 15 with the expiration date set for April 2042.</p>
<p>Retail and Online Keno Products Both Coming to Victoria</p>
<p>The companies will be able to extend both retail and online keno games and products to people who reside in Victoria. The license is an important step towards liberalizing the gambling market as it represents the first instance that a state government has issued a dual license that allows the operation of both a retail and online product.</p>
<p>Up until now, governments only examined and granted licenses on an individual basis. Tabcorp will also now begin to face some competition as it was hitherto the only provider allowed to offer keno products through retail shops in Victoria. The license cost was estimated at AU$60 million ($43.6 million), but will now go up against Lottoland Australia, the subsidiary of the national lottery.</p>
<p>What’s more, Tabcorp encouraged the liberalization of the market and even decided to return its license and apply for it again, arguing that more operators should be allowed to join in on the occasion of the Keno License Review Victoria conducted in 2021. Both Tabcorp and Lottoland are happy with the developments.</p>
<p>Keno Part of Both Lottoland and Tabcorp’s Special Sauce</p>
<p>Lottoland CEO Nigel Birrell welcomed the new opportunity for the company and said that the firm would be launching the KenoGo brand before long, touting the chance to take this product online:</p>
<p>“Most importantly, this license means that consumers in Victoria will be able to enjoy Keno online on their smartphone or computer for the first time ever, with new gaming experiences and greater choice through Lottoland.” Lottoland CEO Nigel Birrell</p>
<p>Tabcorp met the news in equally elated fashion with the managing director for lotteries and keno Sue van der Merwe saying that the company was pleased to reacquire its license and expand it.</p>
<p>“The new structure will allow us to continue offering Victorian players a world class Keno product and responsibly grow the game further, backed by our extensive retail and brand presence and the expertise gained from our existing Keno online business.” Tabcorp managing director for lotteries and keno Sue van der Merwe</p>
<p>Tabcorp will arguably be at an advantage here as it has also offered a similar product in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory, making it a well-seasoned contender.</p>
<p>This is the latest positive development this year for the company, with its lottery and keno businesses already driving the company’s results up.</p>
