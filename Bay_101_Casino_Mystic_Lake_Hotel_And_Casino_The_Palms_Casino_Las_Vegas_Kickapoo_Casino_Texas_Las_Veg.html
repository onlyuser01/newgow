<p>Wazdan Games will provide Bally’s Vera &amp; John brand with hit slot games such as Hot Slot: 777 Rubies and 9 Coins</p>
<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative casino games, has unveiled a new partnership with Bally’s Interactive. Under the agreement, Wazdan will leverage Relax Gaming’s aggregation platform to power its new operator partner with a rich selection of gaming content.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Bally’s Interactive will launch Wazdan games on Vera &amp; John, one of its iGaming brands. The first titles to hit the platform will be hit slots such as Hot Slot: 777 Rubies and 9 Coins.</p>

<p>Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, commented on the new agreement. He highlighted his excitement to work with Bally’s Interactive and supply the Vera &amp; John brand with content. Under the brand’s umbrella, Hyla noted, Wazdan’s content will be able to reach tens of millions of players globally.</p>
<p>The CCO added that Vera &amp; John has an extensive presence in Europe, which is a very important market for his team.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Bally’s Interactive spokesperson commented on the matter, saying that the casino company is happy to onboard content from such a reputable and high-quality studio as Wazdan. The spokesperson praised the provider’s games for their exciting mechanics and cutting-edge visuals and themes.</p>
<p>Their wide range of popular themes and boosted classic mechanics are sure to be a hit with our players. Bally’s Interactive spokesperson</p>
