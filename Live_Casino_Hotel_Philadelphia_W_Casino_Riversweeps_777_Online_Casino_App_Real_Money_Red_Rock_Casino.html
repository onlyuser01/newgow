    <h1>Live Casino Hotel Philadelphia W Casino Riversweeps 777 Online Casino App Real Money Red Rock Casino</h1>

<p>Good evening, I created an account with Novibet. I received the first deposit bonus and finished the wagering requirements as expected. I continued to play as I didn’t sign up just for the bonus. During my tenure as a player, I made a withdrawal of 400 Euros. They messaged me stating that in order to complete the withdrawal, I needed to send a photo of the card I used for depositing to verify my identity. I sent it and received a message that the identification was successful; however, they needed a photo of me holding my ID next to my face and a telephone bill with the registered number I provided. I was completely willing to send these documents. I took the photo and started looking for the bill to send it. But when I tried to log into my account in the evening, I found that it had been deactivated. I spoke to live chat and asked them why my account was deactivated. They responded: "We would like to inform you that your account has been temporarily deactivated by the competent department and is under detailed review for security reasons." I asked them why this happened and they said they didn’t know as it was the decision of the competent department. When I asked how long the review would take, they told me they couldn’t tell or estimate, they refused to provide any information about my account, they didn’t even send me an email. Honestly, I don't understand what happened, why my account was closed. I kindly ask you to advise me on what I need to do to resolve this issue, or perhaps misunderstanding. I saw on your website that this specific casino had a 7.9 security score - how can such a situation occur in a secure casino? Why can't I get the money I won? Please help me resolve this issue. I have explained the issue from my perspective in detail and I am available for any clarification you may need. Thank you in advance for the time you will dedicate to my case. Thank you.</p>
