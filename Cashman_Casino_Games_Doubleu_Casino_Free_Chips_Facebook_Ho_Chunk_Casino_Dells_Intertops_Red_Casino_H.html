<p>Pariplay, the NeoGames S.A subsidiary, has partnered with Atlantic Lottery and thus, expanded its presence in the Canadian market. Thanks to the new agreement, Pariplay will be able to offer Wizard Games’ innovative content as well as third-party games to players via its Fusion platform.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Strategy of Expanding in Canada is Going as Planned</p>
<p>The deal with Atlantic Lottery is just another step in Pariplay’s strategy of expanding its influence in Canada. Just before this partnership, Pariplay secured several B2B gaming licenses in Ontario and launched in Alberta with AGLC.</p>
<p>The vice president of sales at Pariplay, Andrew Maclean, commented on the partnership that the company formed with Atlantic Lottery by saying that regulated North American markets remain at the company’s focus and that so far, Pariplay has had a lot of success in them. The deal with Atlantic Lottery is a “major milestone” for Pariplay and one that can be beneficial for both parties.</p>
<p>Atlantic Lottery’s vice president, Michael MacKinnon, also shared his thoughts. He said that AL’s goal was to find a supplier that’s capable of supplying strong and unique content for its customers and that is exactly what Pariplay is able to offer. MacKinnon added that the content will go live “later this year.”</p>
<p>Pariplay’s expansion in the North American market is not focused on Canada. The provider also set its eyes on the US. Back in March, it partnered with Skillzzgaming to provide US customers with unique content.</p>
<p>The terms of this deal state that Pariplay will gain access to all states where online gambling is considered legal and regulated. Eran Sharar, the CEO of Skillzzgaming stated that the partnership with Pariplay allowed the company to generate unique US content, and hence, Skillzzgaming was happy to have Pariplay as its partner.</p>
<p>NeoGames and Atlantic Lottery Signed an Additional Deal in January</p>
<p>Back in January 2022, Atlantic Lottery signed a five-year deal with NeoPollard Interactive (NPi), a company that is jointly owned by NeoGames and Pollard Banknote Limited. With this deal, Atlantic Lottery gained access to NPi’s library of top-rated gaming content.</p>
<p>Apart from powering Atlantic Lottery, NPi also powers the libraries of 4 US lotteries and that is why the company is considered the leading iLottery partner in North America. Thanks to NPi’s NeoGames Studio, Atlantic Lottery will be able to build upon its online success, enrich its offering, and ultimately, increase its revenues.</p>
<p>Robert Lalonde, Atlantic Lottery’s iGaming manager, stated that the company always “strives to offer the best digital content” with a responsible gambling framework and that the partnership with NPi will allow Atlantic Lottery to broaden its appeal to players.</p>
