<p>Racing and Sports (RAS), a B2B tech, data, digital and media company that services the global racing and betting industry, has teamed up with TVG, a horseracing-oriented betting app.</p>
<p>RAS and TVG Join Forces</p>
<p>As per the agreement, TVG, a subsidiary of the gambling juggernaut FanDuel, will receive premium horse racing content from its new partner. RAS will power TVG’s online and mobile offerings with its international racing content and data. The same content will also be made available on the FanDuel Racing app.</p>
<p>At first, the partnership will only cover content from horse racing events that have been imported into the NA market through TVG’s app or online platform with Sky Racing World’s schedule. All content will be fully localized for a North American audience. TVG will use the new content and data from Racing and Sports to strengthen its racing products with enhanced statistics and analytics.</p>
<p>RAS’s chief executive officer, Stephen Crispe, called this partnership an important step for the company. He noted that this is the first contract of its kind and one that will provide excitement to bettors and horse racing enthusiasts across North America. Crispe concluded that this partnership wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for the earlier partnership between RAS and Sky Racing World, an Australian horse racing company.</p>
<p>2022 Was a Strong Year for RAS</p>
<p>Racing and Sports’ parent company, Racing and Sports Technology Holdings, recently inked a $5 million contract extension with Entain, one of the leading gambling operators. RAS agreed to continue supplying the brand with its acclaimed solutions.</p>
<p>Three days ago, Racing and Sports released its FY2022 financial results. Stephen Crispe outlined some of the company’s major achievements, noting that RAS’ revenue increased by 57%. Crispe also noted that Racing and Sports’ AMRR increased by 35% to $6 million (converted to USD). The CEO said that he is very happy with the results and said that the aforementioned deal extension with Entain is another major milestone for the company.</p>
<p>Five million dollars over five years really goes to cement the strong commercial relationship we have with the Entain family. Stephen Crispe, CEO, Racing and Sports</p>
<p>The next thing Crispe noted is that RAS signed a deal with the Greyhound Board of Great Britain which will help the company consolidate its strength in the United Kingdom, one of Europe’s most influential betting markets.</p>
<p>Crispe also spoke about the company’s aim to double down on its B2B sports betting operations. RAS hopes to produce sports content that is on par with its famed horse racing products. Crispe finally teased that the company has planned several partnerships that will reaffirm its ambitions to grow in the horse racing and sports sector.</p>
