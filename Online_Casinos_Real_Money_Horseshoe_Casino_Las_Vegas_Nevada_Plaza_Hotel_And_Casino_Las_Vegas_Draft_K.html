The new game can bring up to 3,794x in max wins and it comes packed with free spins, mystery multiplying wilds, and other interesting game mechanics. iGaming Group’s commercial manager John Foster described the game as “beautifully designed” and “filled to the brim with fantastic features and mechanics” players are bound to enjoy discovering.</p>

<p>The game’s eye-catching format comes as a result of the attractive fantasy theme and art style chosen by the studio known for creating engaging slot content with bonus rounds, frequent wins, innovative game mechanics, and top RTPs. Players eager to join the mischievous fairies in the magic forest can get ready for the new slot’s 3-4-4-4-3 configuration. The reels are packed with stacked mystery symbols that are replaced by random symbols once the reels are done spinning. All mystery symbols on a reel will be identical, allowing players to easily rack up their wins. Besides the mystery symbols that show in the base game, players can also see wild symbols landing with a mystery multiplier worth up to 5x.</p>
<p>All Wild symbols can also feature a Mystery Multiplier up to 5x. All multipliers are multiplicative.</p>
<p>Seeing a minimum of three scatters landing on reels two to four will instantly enable a free spin bonus. During the free spin bonus round, sticky multiplier wilds pop up on the reels, staying in their positions for the remainder of the round, gradually changing their value from 1x to 5x with each new spin. During the same round, players are awarded 10 Free Spins with Sticky Multiplier Wilds and instant payouts.</p>
<p>Betsoft’s team lead for account management Jonathan Crook described the new game as one that provides players with an “adventurous and nostalgic” gaming experience packed with mystery and “sprinkled with fairy dust.” Crook added that the company which is fully committed to providing the best premium omnichannel gaming solutions to licensed operators was “absolutely delighted” to watch the “charming slot” go live with iGaming Group’s white-label solutions. The new game will join joining iGaming Group’s portfolio of products and go live across all MGA casinos as a result of an exclusive agreement valid for one 1 month.</p>
<p>The official release date for Woodlanders was set for December 8, 2022. At the beginning of the month, Iron Dog Studios also chose MGA-licensed iGaming Group’s sites for the launch of its fresh Rum &amp; Raiders Hold and Win game.</p>
