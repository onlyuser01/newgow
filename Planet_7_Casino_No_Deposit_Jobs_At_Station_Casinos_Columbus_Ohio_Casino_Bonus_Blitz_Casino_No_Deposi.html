<p>The entertainment industry leader NetEnt increased its market presence in Pennsylvania after integrating with the recently launched online casino PlayLive! by The Cordish Companies. The portfolio by NetEnt is now available on the new online brand PlayLive!. One of the most famous NetEnt hits such as Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest, and Divine Fortune as well as many more online casino and table games are now available for players in the state.</p>
<p>The online casino PlayLive! debuted in August 2020 making it the first branded online gaming site to launch before the opening of the two new land-based casinos by the Cordish in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The games by NetEnt have already proven to be an instant hit with the local players ever since the company went live in the state last year.</p>
<p>But with the latest move, NetEnt is cementing its position which is already strong in Pennsylvania. The new PlayLive! casino can be accessed by desktop PC and it is also available for download on both iOS and Android devices.</p>
