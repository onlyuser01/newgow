<p>The NFL season has begun, and fantasy football is in full swing. The top running backs available for waiver wire pickups in Week 2 include Kyren Williams from the Los Angeles Rams and Justice Hill from the Baltimore Ravens.</p>

<p>Other potential running backs available on your fantasy football waiver wire include Kenneth Gainwell from the Philadelphia Eagles, Joshua Kelley from the Los Angeles Chargers, Tyler Allgeier from the Atlanta Falcons, or Tank Bigbsy from the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Gainwell was a part of a running back by committee for the Eagles last season who secured a spot in Super Bowl LVII. In a 25-20 victory in Week 1, Gainwell carried the ball 14 times for 54 yards against the New England Patriots. He added four receptions for 20 yards and racked up 74 combined yards from scrimmage.</p>
<p>Kelley, backup behind Austin Ekeler on the Chargers, rushed 16 times for 91 yards and a touchdown in a shootout against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1.</p>
<p>Second-year running back Allgeier scored two touchdowns for the Falcons in Week 1. He rushed 15 times for 75 yards and added three receptions for 19 yards against the Carolina Panthers. Allgeier outgained rookie running back Bijan Robinson (10 attempts for 56 yards).</p>
<p>If you’re in a 12-team or 14-team fantasy football league, consider backup running back Tank Bigsby from the Jacksonville Jaguars. Bigsby, a rookie from Auburn, rushed seven times for 13 yards, including one touchdown for the Jaguars.</p>
<p>Kyren Williams (RB, Rams)</p>
<p>The Rams, predicted to win six games this season, pulled off a huge upset over the Seattle Seahawks in Week 1. The Seahawks were a five-point favorite in a divisional game but suffered a 17-point loss against the visiting Rams.</p>
<p>There was a grittiness, there was a toughness, there was a resilience on display from this team,” said head coach Sean McVay. “And I loved it, especially Kyren Williams.”</p>
<p>Williams began the season as a backup running back behind Cam Akers. Although Akers saw more touches than Williams — 22 to 15 — in Week 1, Akers produced only 29 rushing yards.</p>
<p>Williams turned heads with 52 rushing yards and two touchdowns on only 15 carries. He scored the season’s first touchdown for the Rams during a 16-play, 75-yard drive at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Rams selected the speedy Williams with a fifth-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. The former standout from Notre Dame scored 27 rushing touchdowns in 24 games during his last two seasons in South Bend.</p>
<p>Williams saw limited action with the Rams during his rookie season, with 35 carries for 139 yards and zero touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Rams (1-0) play four home games over the next six weeks. They face tough opponents, including the San Francisco 49ers (Week 2), Bengals (Week 3), and the Eagles (Week 5).</p>
<p>The Rams opened as +7 home underdogs against the 49ers next Sunday.</p>
<p>The 49ers are the consensus favorite to win the NFC West at -500 odds. They began the season as -160 odds but saw a huge jump after they steamrolled the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 1. The Rams did not see any change in their divisional odds, which remain steady at +1000.</p>
<p>Justice Hill (RB, Ravens)</p>
<p>The Ravens incurred a bad beat in Week 1 when starting running back J.K. Dobbins ruptured his Achilles in the second half against the Houston Texans. The Ravens have decent depth at running back, including Hill, Gus Edwards, and former All-Pro Melvin Gordon.</p>
<p>Hill and Edwards were battling for the backup job in the preseason. But after Dobbins went down, they might be splitting time going forward. Gordon began the season on the practice squad, and the Ravens will promote him to the roster.</p>
<p>Edwards rushed eight times for 32 yards in Week 1, while Hill was utilized in short-yardage situations against the Texans. Hill rushed eight times for nine yards but scored two touchdowns. Hill averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season.</p>
<p>The Ravens started the season 1-0 but face one of their toughest stretches with three road games over the next four weeks. They square off against three division rivals, and all three AFC North rumbles are on the road. The Ravens host the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3 as their lone home game over the next four weeks.</p>
<p>The Ravens throw down against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 2. The Bengals are fresh off a loss against the Cleveland Browns. But oddsmakers installed them as a -3 favorite against the Ravens in Week 2.</p>
<p>Even though the Ravens lost Dobbins to a season-ending injury, they’re the cofavorite to win the AFC North at +200 odds.</p>
