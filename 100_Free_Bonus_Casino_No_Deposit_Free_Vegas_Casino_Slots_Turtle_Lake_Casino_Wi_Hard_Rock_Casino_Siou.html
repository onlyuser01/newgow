    <h1>100 Free Bonus Casino No Deposit Free Vegas Casino Slots Turtle Lake Casino Wi Hard Rock Casino Siou</h1>

<p>My sister used my card which in their ts and Cs is acceptable as long as card holder is authorised.. They have asked my my bank card which was used a copy of my passport / photo and bank showing withdrawal which was all provided 7 times she withdrew 30 she had no bonuses and is staying with me because she is unwell she only has a post office card due to her being on benefits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately someone close to me with access to my details had put me and my computer on gamstop after having never ever gambled in my entire life I spent Â£100 pounds over Christmas which I could easily afford.</p>
<p>Mr Q have responded to her emails we have proof she has uploaded all required and they continue to ask for same documents</p>
<p>They took money from the card even though it is in my name and their terms and conditions state a card she has authority to use which she does. I was with her when she made the deposit. They refuse to speak to me despite being the card holder.</p>
<p>Wondering if you can help and also how do I prove I personally did not put myself on gamstop. To be honest I never noticed until I tried to go on uk site and was blocked and informed I had signed up for gamstop. I have a fair idea of who it was but would not like to get them into any bother</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
