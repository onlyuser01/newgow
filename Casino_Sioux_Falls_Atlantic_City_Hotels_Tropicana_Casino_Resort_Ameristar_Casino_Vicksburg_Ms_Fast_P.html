    <h1>Casino Sioux Falls Atlantic City Hotels Tropicana Casino Resort Ameristar Casino Vicksburg Ms Fast P</h1>

<p>The Major League Baseball (MLB) has officially ventured into the world of lottery draw games through a new multi-year partnership deal with Kentucky-based live sports lottery game developer EquiLottery Games. Under this partnership, the league and the game developer will launch a new officially-licensed lottery game that is referred to as Baseball Buck and as per the terms of the deal, this game will feature all the official brand marks of the MLB as well as all 30 MLB Clubs.</p>
<p>Baseball Bucks is based on the patented game platform that is developed by EquiLottery and it marks the very first time that professional sports league in the United States is entering the lottery draw game sector. The goal with this product is to appeal to a totally different kind of lottery player, that is, unlike other traditional sports gambling fans. Moreover, it will be an amazing way to further expand engagement with baseball fans.</p>
<p>The lottery game will involve the plyer purchasing a $5 quick-pick ticket featuring ten games from the day’s MLB regular-season schedule. Winning tickets in Baseball Bucks will match anywhere between 7 to 10 winning teams, out of 10 winners. There will also be four prize tiers and overalls odds of just 6 to 1.</p>
<p>Already, the game seems to be resonating quite well with its intended audience. According to EquiLottery Games’ chief executive Brad Cummings, early response from the lotteries to Baseball Bucks “has been exceedingly positive.”</p>
<p>EquiLottery has also supported its lottery offerings through a series of outstanding products and service which make the games very easy to access for the customers. Some of these products and services have been integrated into the new Baseball Bucks game and therefore the players can expect gaming experiences that are out of this world.</p>
<p>Other MLB Partnerships</p>
<p>The MLB has been one of the most aggressive US sports leagues in as far as capitalizing on sports betting is concerned. That said, the league has inked several other leagues to ensure that its data is utilized properly for their own benefit as well as for the benefit of the bettors. To ensure that its data was in the right hands, the league signed partnership deals with Stats Perform and Sportradar, both of which have been helping it to push game and player statistics.</p>
<p>At the end of August 2019, the league inked a third deal with San Francisco-based sports gambling tech firm Swish Analytics to provide real-time official league data. In addition to that, both companies will also be collaborating to introduce “digital fan-engagement experiences.”</p>
