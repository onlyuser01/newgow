<p>The tsunami of layoffs in Nevada continues to gather strength affecting hundreds of Southern Nevada employees this time. According to multiple documents which became public Friday, 5 large companies expect to lay off or already have laid off more than 800 employees in total.</p>
<p>More WARN Notices of Pending Layoffs</p>
<p>More than 330 people working at two Las Vegas Valley nongaming hotels are facing layoffs effective October 30, as the Westin told the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation it will release permanently 190 workers, while Renaissance Las Vegas is planning to lay off 147 employees.</p>
<p>Addus Healthcare is closing 358 positions between its two offices, 6128 W. Sahara Ave in Las Vegas and 41 N. Highway 160 in Pahrump according to the official documents filed under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act.</p>
<p>The tourist agency Sundance Helicopters filed a notice August 21, announcing its plans to lay off 114 of its employees, while Live Nation Entertainment is informing previous furloughs of 74 people from House of Blues inside Mandalay Bay may last longer than 6 months, with the continuation of the furlough being effectively considered as a mass layoff, despite the company expecting it would be only temporary.</p>
<p>Layoffs in Gaming Sector</p>
<p>Previously, Penn National Gaming announced that its M Resort Spa Casino in Las Vegas would lay off initially 352 employees and later on added another 58 to make the total number of people losing their jobs to 410. The notice sent by the company to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation under the WARN Act was dated August 6, with all affected employees being notified August 15.</p>
<p>Even before that, in July, Penn National informed the Department its Tropicana property would decrease the number of its employees by more than 600, as the casino is constantly pushing forward its reopening date, from September 1 initially, to September 17, and even the latest date might not be the reopen date as uncertainty in the casino and hospitality industry continues to prevail.</p>
<p>Effective August 10, Casino Royale permanently laid off 98 people due to the negative impact on the business of the coronavirus outbreak. According to the company’s notice, the casino operator continued with a mass layoff which began May 27 by downsizing members of staff half of whom are casino dealers, with the rest including a pit manager, slot hosts and other slot employees, cashiers and surveillance workers.</p>
<p>Also in August, casino and hospitality operator Wynn Resorts announced it would permanently lay off 252 workers at the Le Reve – The Dream as it closes down the venue, while restaurant chain the Hakkasan Group announced it would close down permanently the Searsucker restaurant at Caesars Palace and release 52 workers.</p>
