<p>ICE London 2023 is set to break the attendance record for the event as exhibitors from 68 nations have already confirmed their participation in the event, announced the event organizers, Clarion Gaming, in a press release.</p>
<p>Affirming as the Industry’s Leading Exhibition</p>
<p>Running from February 7-9, 2023, ICE London will feature 623 exhibitors coming from 68 countries around the world, spanning from Argentina, Mexico and the US, to Australia and Macau. ICE London 2020 featured exhibitors from 65 nations worldwide.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Clarion Gaming’s managing director Stuart Hunter highlighted how much the event had grown through the years to reach a level of internationalization “no other exhibition in the gaming space can come anywhere near.”</p>
<p>Hunter added that the industry’s interest in the event positions ICE London as “a global experience with unique access to the smartest gaming innovations drawn from every corner of the world,” adamant that there are “very few exhibitions of scale in any industry sector” that can be compared with the event and claim to be global or world events.</p>
<p>As the biggest B2B gambling industry event, ICE 2023 will feature game creators, distributors, operators, retailers, trade associations, strategic bodies, and industry regulators all gathered at ExCel London to represent every gaming vertical.</p>
<p>A Week That Sets Directions for the Year</p>
<p>“Research that we’ve undertaken has shown that for many people ICE and iGB Affiliate London actually start on the Sunday pre-ceding and finish on the following Saturday,” Hunter continued, sharing the company’s estimations that “in that week, … over 100 gambling industry events will take place outside of the show hours providing a new and compelling perspective on why ICE and iGB Affiliate London are so influential and important to the world industry.”</p>
<p>His opinion was shared by Simon Thomas, executive chairman of The Hippodrome Casino which serves as a member of the ICE Ambassador Group of industry advisers, who stated that “to see ICE as simply being a three-day live event” is no longer appropriate.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s observations, “the industry is arriving in London a lot earlier and staying considerably longer,” making ICE London “a full week of intensive networking, events, presentations, award ceremonies, meetings, and socializing.”</p>
<p>“The phenomenal international credentials make this coming together of buyers, games creators, influencers, and thought leaders into what I would describe as World Gaming Week,” Thomas continued, connecting industry developments taking place over the year “to conversations that occurred during the week in London.”</p>
<p>ICE London 2023 will also feature the biggest Consumer Protection Zone to date, according to an earlier announcement made by Clarion Gaming.</p>
