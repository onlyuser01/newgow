<p>Bompers review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Bompers has a sci-fi fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>Players will arrive in a futuristic world filled with neon lights and plenty of exotic fruits in capsules. They’ll need to stay ahead of the curve in this space-age universe if they want a taste of the cherries, oranges, and melons.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players who enjoy fruit machine themes, but have a hankering for a modern twist.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Bompers welcomes players with a digitally-infused dance mix. This lively tune is accented by vocalizations and plenty of club-worthy sound effects.</p>
<p>In the spaceship-style setting, dark purples and blues are contrasted with electric neon hues. Players will see each potential position on the reels subtly glow with regular pulses of light. This creates a galactic nightclub aesthetic with a hint of 80s flair.</p>
<p>On the reels, all the classic fruit machine fruits are waiting, animated in a retro video game style. The lemons and oranges are also joined by shamrocks and lucky horseshoes.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack give a sci-fi party twist to a classic fruit machine theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Bompers slot has a base structure of 6x4, with the reels expanding to up to 6x8 during special features.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels. This is calculated from the leftmost reel to the rightmost.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that are part of winning combinations vanish. This allows new symbols to fall in from above to take their place.</p>
<p>Due to the staggered nature of the positions, symbols that remain on the reels during Cascades may roll slightly into fresh locations.</p>
<p>Players can opt into the X-citer mode, which allows them to increase their bet size in order to prompt an increase in special symbols/features.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Mystery Bomb, Shooting Star, and Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>When triggered, the Mystery Bomb transforms itself and all symbols connected to it into a randomly selected symbol. If more than one Mystery Bomb overlaps, the overlapping symbols are changed into Wilds.</p>
<p>The Shooting Star symbol moves upwards on the reels and when it reaches the top, it manifests a selection of as many as 7 symbols. At least 3 of these symbols will be Wild symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. The feature begins with 7 free spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.8%, slightly below our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Bompers is high, making it consistent with our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We do not recommend this low RTP, high volatility fruit machine-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though its sci-fi fruit machine aesthetic is a bit fun, Bompers doesn’t quite bring enough to the table to excuse its subpar RTP.</p>
<p>The high volatility may turn the heads of mathematically inclined players, but these would do just as well pursuing a slot that offers a more favorable RTP.</p>
<p>The bonus features and unique gameplay give Bompers some appeal that may be enough to intrigue some players.</p>
