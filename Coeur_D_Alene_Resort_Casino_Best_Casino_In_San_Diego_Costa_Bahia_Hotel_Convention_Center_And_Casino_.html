<p>Wolf Gold review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The plains of North America are host to a vast ecosystem of beautiful and majestic creatures. This is a fact that slot machines cannot resist and so Wolf Gold joins a regular pantheon of slots with buffalo, cougar, and bald eagle bedecked slot machines.</p>
<p>This one focuses on the wolf pack with its stacked wilds with the face of a wolf painted onto them.</p>
<p>In the background is the red sandstone of Monument Valley and in the foreground, the symbols are all laid over reels the colour of desert sand.</p>
<p>Attractive visuals of the Wolf Gold slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are nicely painted in the very particular style of American Mural art that looks both difficult, detailed and kind of cheap. But despite this, the aesthetic is well in keeping with the theme and with the exception of the ace to jack symbols the visual style works.</p>
<p>This is coupled with simple but effective animations and a soundtrack of wolves howling and the wind blowing that really creates an atmosphere.</p>
<p>Overall the design elements of this slot from Pragmatic Play work surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty good, with several fun twists to keep an eye on. There are the stacked Wilds which make for some exciting moments when a big win almost appears thanks to multiple winlines catching a couple of consecutive stacks of Wilds.</p>
<p>This is coupled with the Money symbol bonuses (more on this below) and the attendant three jackpots of differing sizes.</p>
<p>Overall there is a lot to like in Wolf Gold that makes the gameplay more than just a simple twenty-five win line slot machine.</p>
<p>Wild symbols are stacked on reels in Wolf Gold slot</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol plays as any symbol except for the Money bonus or the Scatter. The Wilds are stacked.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol appears only on reels one, three and five. If you hit three symbols you win an amount equal to your bet per spin and then play the Free Spin bonus. In the Free Spin round you receive five free spins and can retrigger three more spins by hitting three scatter symbols again. There is no limit to how many times you can retrigger the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>During your free spins the middle three reels are turned into one giant symbol which plays as if those three reels all landed on the same symbol. As a result all your wins will contain four or five symbols making for much bigger payouts.</p>
<p>The Money Bonus is triggered when six or more money symbols fall. These symbols are locked in place and the rest of the reels are spun again. During the Money Bonus every reel contains only Money symbols and blanks. You have three spins which reset every time you hit a money symbol. The game plays until you fill all the reels or your spins run out. You are then paid the amount on all the Money symbols added together. If you fill the reel you also win the maximum jackpot.</p>
<p>Money symbols respin feature</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>This game has medium volatility and an RTP of 96.00%. So be aware that it is at the bottom of our recommended range.</p>
<p>The bet range per spin on the sites we tested were £/$/€0.25 to £/$/€125.00.</p>
<p>Paytable of the Wolf Gold slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Wolf Gold is a fun slot with some cool bonus features that really elevate the gameplay from being just another prairie home companion slot machine.</p>
<p>Its main detraction is the medium volatility, but if you’re not going with our strategies you might opt to give this one a go.</p>
