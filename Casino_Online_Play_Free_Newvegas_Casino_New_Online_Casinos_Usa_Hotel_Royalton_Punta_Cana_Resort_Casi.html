<p>7777 Gaming Tops New Chief Executive to Strengthen Company</p>
<p>He has also worked with some of the largest poker networks in the United States as well as with NetEnt in Malta. His appointment as the new chief executive at 7777 gaming comes after weeks and months of busy expansion for the company, which has secured a number of new partnerships with operators across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>His appointment was welcomed by Milen Ganev, 7777 gaming co-founder, who said that the company was happy to see Mitev join it at the helm and steer it to new milestones and successes.</p>
<p>It’s an advantageous move for our entire team as well as our partners, thanks to his extraordinary leadership and business skills that deliver win-win results. Milen Ganev, 7777 gaming co-founder</p>
<p>Ganev hailed Mitev’s well-established track record in many jurisdictions, including the United States, Latin America, and Asia. Mitev himself was very pleased with the appointment and said that 7777 gaming had a deep-rooted understanding of the B2C and B2B verticals that gave it an edge when producing and delivering games.</p>
<p>Mitev will be in charge of the company’s commercial, iGaming and tech professionals as he continues to forward 7777’s mission which is to disrupt the status quo in the industry and transform the online casino experience for all. 7777 gaming is also gaining momentum in verticals such as lottery products and instant win games.</p>
<p>7777 Gaming has expanded its content distribution capacity most recently with two important partnerships in the industry – one with 1×2 Network and one with EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine. The company was also recently shortlisted in two categories at the BSG Awards 2023.</p>
