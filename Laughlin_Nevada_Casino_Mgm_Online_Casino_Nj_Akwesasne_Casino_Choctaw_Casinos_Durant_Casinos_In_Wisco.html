    <h1>Laughlin Nevada Casino Mgm Online Casino Nj Akwesasne Casino Choctaw Casinos Durant Casinos In Wisco</h1>

<p>Empire Technological Group Limited dba Play Synergy has confirmed in an email press release shared with media outlets that it is intending to acquire Aruze Gaming America’s slot operations. The pending acquisition, as outlined by the press release, extends to both the online and land-based sectors and assets owned by Aruze Gaming America.</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to court and regulatory approvals which means that Play Synergy may need to wait a while before it may move with the purchase. However, the company is confident that this should happen at some point in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Play Synergy is confident that this acquisition is precisely what the company needs to expand its reach in the targeted verticals and establish its own footprint in the sector. Play Synergy is also assuring customers and clients that the assumption of all related services and operations will go smoothly without any issues for anyone involved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, team members need not worry about reemployment opportunities, says Play Synergy President Frank Feng. He said that both Aruze and Play Synergy are working to ensure that Aruze team members have new employment opportunities in those cases that concern changes or reductions in the existing headcount.</p>
<p>"This along with interest from others in the industry has had the result of minimizing the disruption to those impacted and their families," Feng explained. This comment comes in light of a recent report by the Las Vegas Review-Journal which reported that Aruze Gaming America will be shuttering its Las Vegas headquarters in August and laying off some 100 people in the process.</p>
<p>The company has already submitted a notice to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation and the measure will come into effect on August 18. The current company predicament is an opportunity for Play Synergy, a distinguished provider of cutting-edge solutions for the gaming industry, to strengthen its footprint and leverage Aruze’s know-how, expertise, and infrastructure are put to good use.</p>
