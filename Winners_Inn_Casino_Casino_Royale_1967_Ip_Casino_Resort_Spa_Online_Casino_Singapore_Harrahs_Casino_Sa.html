<p>Jack’s Casino &amp; Sports, also known as Jacks.nl, has demonstrated its commitment to safer gambling by launching a very special offer to its customers. The Dutch operator will offer its players a free Gamban subscription.</p>
<p>Jacks.nl Wants to Protect Its Customers</p>
<p>Gamban is a responsible gaming software that allows punters to exclude themselves from online gambling. The critically-acclaimed software prevents its users from accessing all kinds of gambling sites, both legal and illegal.</p>
<p>Eric Olders, CEO of Jacks.nl’s ownership group, JVH, said that safer gambling is very important to the company. He emphasized that his group cares deeply for its customers. Because of that, it wants to provide them with the means to shield themselves from gambling harm.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that gambling must always be an experience, based on hospitality, safety, variety and, most of all, fun. By offering this software for free – on top of all our other responsible gaming tools and processes – we can provide even greater protection to players. Eric Olders, CEO, JVH</p>
<p>Olders noted that Jacks.nl has long promoted Gamban and is glad to be the first Dutch operator to offer it for free. He said that the brand strives for a safe and trusted environment for all players. Therefore, simply excluding vulnerable players is not enough. Instead, a more efficient solution would be to provide players with the means to exclude themselves from all sites.</p>
<p>Gamban Is Impressed with Jacks.nl’s Commitment</p>
<p>James Forman, a business intelligence officer for Gamban, also shared his thoughts. He revealed that the whole Gamban team is happy to be working with JVH and its brands. In addition, Forman lauded Jacks.nl’s commitment to safer gaming.</p>
<p>Jack’s Casino &amp; Sports is demonstrating its strong commitment to its players, by offering fully paid for Gamban licenses to their customers. Gamban is most effective when used in addition to other tools and support, such as signing up to CRUKS, and the use of low limits for young adults. James Forman, business intelligence officer, Gamban</p>
<p>Forman added that Gamban considers Jacks.nl to be a key partner and noted that the gaming brand has always been looking for innovative protection solutions.</p>
<p>Gamban was founded in 2015. Since then, it has offered effective solutions that help gamblers get their habits under control. Gamban’s solutions are developed by experienced individuals with a solid grasp of the gambling industry. It is now used by thousands of people across the globe and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback.</p>
