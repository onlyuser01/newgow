<p>Wizard Games, a developer of premium iGaming experiences, has designated Benedict McDonagh as its new managing director. The new leadership appointment comes as the studio seeks to “turbo-charge” its progress toward becoming a leading name in online gambling.</p>
<p>McDonagh is an experienced gaming industry veteran who will help the NeoGames subsidiary reach its goals. The hire boasts over 18 years of experience in iGaming and has worked for many high-profile companies in the sector.</p>
<p>The appointee joins Wizard Games from Green Jade Group, a developer of slots that he himself founded five years ago and headed for a while. Prior to that, McDonagh held positions in companies such as Mr Green, Poker Starts and Betfair.</p>
<p>McDonagh joins Wizard Games as part of the management team headed by Adrian Bailey, Pariplay’s managing director. As a part of that team, he will work to improve the company pipeline and deliver more value-driven iGaming experiences to operators.</p>
<p>The new hire joins at an important moment for Wizard Games, which has been expanding its team with key appointments. Before welcoming McDonagh as MD, the company designated Simon Jagdhar as director of game studio and Yoganand Aiyadurai as director of game technology.</p>
<p>McDonagh Intends to Use His Experience to Benefit the Company</p>
<p>Benedict McDonagh shared his thoughts on joining the game studio, praising Wizard Games for its ambitiousness and goal of “making a major splash” in regulated markets.

<p>I aim to use all the know-how I have accumulated in my career to take the studio to the next level, so that we can make a real impact with operators and players globally. Benedict McDonagh, MD, Wizard Games</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Adrian Bailey, Pariplay’s managing director, said that the Wizard Games division continues to expand in regulated markets all over the world. He attributed the studio’s successes to the talented team working to make all of that happen.</p>
<p>Bailey noted that McDonagh is a perfect fit for the company and will bring industry experience that Wizard Games values and needs.</p>
