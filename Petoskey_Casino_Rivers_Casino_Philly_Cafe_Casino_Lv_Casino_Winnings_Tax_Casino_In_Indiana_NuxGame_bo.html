<p>The experienced betting and software provider, NuxGame, announced it penned a new content partnership, expanding further its offering. On Tuesday, the company revealed it joined forces with the provider of provably fair games for the iGaming vertical, Turbo Games.</p>
<p>Per the new collaboration, Turbo Games agreed to supply a wide range of its portfolio of content for NuxGame. As a result, the provider will expand the reach of its leading content, bringing its engaging titles to new audiences.</p>
<p>The new content deal also brings benefits for NuxGame, as the company boosts its existing offering by delivering new games for its players. Offering provably fair games, Turbo Games' titles stand out with transparency and the support of cryptocurrencies. While the provider's games primarily support cryptocurrencies, its content can also be used with all major FIAT currencies, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>Besides flexible payment methods, Turbo Games' content stands out with multi-language support. The company's titles support English, as well as French, Spanish, Russian and Korean, making them suitable for deployment in different jurisdictions around the globe.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new partnership, NuxGame customers will be able to tap into twenty titles from Turbo Games. Such games include Turbo Games' most famous title, Turboplinko, as well as other engaging and player-favorite games such as DoubleRoll, Crash X and Mines, among others.</p>
<p>The new content deal with Turbo Games further boosts NuxGame's offering and reaffirms its position as a leading provider of software and content for the growing online gambling industry. By now, the company offers Agent System, Sportsbook, Online Casino and this offering is now further boosted via the games that are famous for leveraging provably fair technology.</p>
<p>NuxGame's Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Heywood, shared his excitement about the latest deal saying: "Turbo Games' portfolio is both unique and innovative, the provider's ability to captivate players with provably fair mechanics makes it the ideal partner for NuxGame."</p>
<p>Last but not least, he explained: "We look forward to seeing how our customers respond to Turbo Games' collection, as we strive towards providing unmatched online casino software for our clients."</p>
<p>Details of the new content deal come on the heels of another important partnership announced by NuxGame recently. Late last month, the company expanded its casino game offering via a deal with Amigo Gaming, a leading iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NuxGame also inked a deal with LSports, a fast-growing company that is focused on providing sports data feeds. Under the terms of that deal, NuxGame sought to expand its betting product by delivering engaging and unique opportunities for its customer base.</p>
