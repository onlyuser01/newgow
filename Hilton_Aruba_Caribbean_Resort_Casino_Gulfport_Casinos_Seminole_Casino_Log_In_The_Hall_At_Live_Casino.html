<p>Titan Strike review</p>
<p>Titan Strike is themed around ancient Greek culture and mythology.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves standing before a stone temple, deciphering messages from mysterious deities. To avoid the wrath of these gods, players will need to stay on their toes.</p>
<p>Fans of ancient history will especially appreciate this slot.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack of Titan Strike is a meandering melody with a dreamy quality. Players will feel as if they are entering a world somewhat apart from their own. Wins are accentuated with chiming notes that add cheerful excitement.</p>
<p>The reels are framed by stone pillars, with many of the symbols appearing to be carved in stone as well. This helps to uphold the ancient aesthetic of this slot.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will see a range of mythological figures. Medusa makes an appearance with a fierce expression and snakes for hair. A Cyclops also makes an appearance with his large singular eye and grimacing face.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see other classical buildings with cream-hued pillars and elegant stairways. In the distance, mountains and a blue sky are visible.</p>
<p>Together, the soundtrack and animation of Titan Strike create an engrossing interpretation of the ancient Greek world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Titan Strike is a five-reel, three-row slot, with 15 win lines.</p>
<p>If players wish, they can buy directly into the Free Spins feature for 40x their total bet. Buying into the Super Free Spins feature costs 80x the player’s total bet (see feature details below).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols when evaluating wins.</p>
<p>Lightning Strike symbols can appear on reels 2-4. When at least 3 Lightning Strike symbols appear, a cash prize is awarded.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Bonus symbols. Bonus symbols can only land on reels 2-4.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, a Lightning symbol is fixed at the center of reel 3, increasing players’ odds of winning a cash prize. Lightning symbols also land more frequently during the Free Spins feature.</p>
<p>For every Bonus symbol that lands during the Free Spins feature, players are awarded an additional free spin.</p>
<p>Players are awarded 10 Super Free Spins if they land Bonus symbols on reels 2 and 4, as well as the Super Bonus symbol on reel 3. Throughout the Super Free Spins feature, a guaranteed win is active.</p>
<p>A Lightning Strike symbol is fixed in the middle of reel 3 for the duration of the Super Free Spins feature as well. Players can be awarded an additional free spin for each Bonus symbol that appears during this feature.</p>
<p>Titan Strike features a Collection Meter which increases by +1 for every Lightning Strike symbol that lands. Each stage of the Collection Meter awards free spins when completed, and completing the fifth stage awards Super Free Spins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
