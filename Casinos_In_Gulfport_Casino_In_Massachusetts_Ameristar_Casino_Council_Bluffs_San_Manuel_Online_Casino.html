<p>Pragmatic Play has announced on Monday that it expanded its Live Casino reach in Europe with a brand-new live casino studio in Bulgaria, a fast-developing iGaming market, which has attracted several big names from the industry over the past weeks.</p>
<p>This marks an important milestone for Pragmatic, which is constantly looking to introduce new pivots and opportunities for its further growth and reach. The company itself offers more than 250 titles across numerous verticals that go well beyond Live Casino, including slots, table games, virtual sports, bingo, and even sportsbook.</p>
<p>Pragmatic, though, has decided to take on the Live Casino segment in the hopes of vying for more market share in this highly promising and important market, the company explained in a press release. Pragmatic is the author of immersive Live Casino experiences that will now have the opportunity to launch from the new studio in the Balkan country.</p>
<p>The studio is another state-of-the-art facility that bears the Pragmatic signature style. It’s based in Sofia and the company is already determined to hire more than 2,000 people in additional staff in Bulgaria by 2023. This is one of the biggest commitments in terms of the workforce that the country’s gaming and gambling industry has seen.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides welcomed the opportunity and said that the company was very determined to continue investing in Sofia and Bulgaria. The local team has already proven a great addition to Pragmatic Play’s family, and it’s bound to help spearhead the incoming important changes.</p>
<p>"It is an important step for us as we look to both expand the capacity of our Live Casino operations and intend to work with the fantastic talent in Bulgaria," Cornides added. The studio will help establish Pragmatic Play’s global footprint and see the company double down on its efforts to dominate this promising vertical.</p>
<p>Pragmatic will continue to invest in its slots and bingo portfolio, along with other products it’s presently interested in. Pragmatic Play recently made news as it donated around $8,000 to the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park in Gibraltar. The company has also been actively expanding its footprint with established and prominent operators, including Betway, which launched the company’s live blackjack casino studio.</p>
