<p>Shortly after Spain proposed new restrictive measures to online gambling and betting, advertisement and promotions, the DGOJ presented the Q1, 2020 gambling numbers, marking an overall 12.5% year-over-year increase in gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Posts Solid Results Yet Another Time in Q1, 2020</p>
<p>Spain’s gambling revenue has grown yet again in the first quarter of the year. Results for Q1, 2020 were up 12.5% year-over-year, thanks to accelerated activity across every vertical of the market, including sports betting as well as iGaming, bingo, and poker. However, most activities came to a halt in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced most of Spain on shutdown.</p>
<p>Revenue leading up to March 31, however, ended up at €218.0 million or around $246 million. The official results from the Dirección General del Ordenación del Juego show that players wagered an estimated €4.80 billion or up 3.6% year-over-year.</p>
<p>There has been a growth in the frequency and volume of online betting and gaming accounts, with 289,340 new people signing up to place a bet, or a 5.6% more than a year before. Some 911,218 accounts were active during the reported period.</p>
<p>Sports betting naturally contributed the most to the overall results with €110.6 million in the books or 8.7% year-over-year growth, and 50.8% of the whole quarterly total. Fixed-odds betting was the main and most bet-on market, which also grew by 13.1%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live betting, or in-play betting as it’s known, accounted for the second-largest generator of revenue with €61.3 million during the period, or 4% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Spanish Online Casinos Mark an Uptick in Results</p>
<p>Another vertical of growth was online gaming in Spain. The revenue was up by 16.8% over the period, arriving at €77.6 million over the entire reported period released in DGOJ’s latest numbers. Slots were the main driver of growth with €43.2 million of the total revenue.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live roulette added €18.4 million to the total revenue, which constituted a 35.6% growth in the specific segment, DGOJ reported. Meanwhile, poker has seen more people joining and trying the game. The revenue stood at €24.2 million or a 13.1% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>Tournaments during the lockdown grew quickly, the regulator explained, and cash game contributions rose by 7.9% to €8.1 million. Bingo operations added another €3.7 million to the overall results, marking a 14.7% overall increase in activities.</p>
<p>DGOJ offered insight into marketing investment by gambling firms, which saw another 28.3% in Q1 and ended with €118.2 million. However, marketing efforts may soon come to a halt, after Spain sent a revised gambling regulation proposal to the European Commission.</p>
<p>Effectively, Spain wants to curb the reach of gambling advertisement, suspend most promotions, and tighten the control and restrictions over the sector. Some of those measures were part of ad-hoc solutions during the lockdown, but they have now been inked into the long-term plans of the government.</p>
<p>Should they come into effect, this may stop years of growth Spain has been posting recently. Gambling advertisements were limited when the COVID-19 crisis began. But even before that, the government said that it would seek to suspend at least 80% of all gambling advertisements in the country.</p>
