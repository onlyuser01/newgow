<p>Spinomenal and Lottoland have formed a new content alliance, the companies shared in a press release. The partnership seeks to further strengthen both companies’ presence in iGaming and ensure that they benefit from their unique respective offer.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has agreed to supply its titles to Lottoland, and its customers, or 16 million people worldwide. Thanks to this tie-up, players will get to experience a number of market-leading games that have become popular all over the world.</p>
<p>Among those are such Spinomenal hits as Wolf Fang, Book of Rampage, Demi Gods II, and Majestic King. As a company, Spinomenal has a massive selection of products to offer to players, and it intends to continue delivering excellent content as part of the new partnership.</p>
<p>Spinomenal will similarly have the tremendous opportunity to consolidate its footprint in key markets and maintain a strong presence. Lottoland will further boost its iGaming operations, which complement its bingo, lottery, and sportsbook verticals.</p>
<p>Talking about this new opportunity, Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz said that he was happy to see his company strengthen its position in the sector, and with a leading gambling brand at this. He praised the opportunity to collaborate with Lottoland and provide Spinomenal’s extensive portfolio of games to the operator.</p>
<p>Lottoland Group CEO Nigel Birrell was similarly pleased with the collaboration. He noted that the 16-million customer base that his company currently has will definitely seek to explore the title brought online by Spinomenal.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to be working with Spinomenal and look forward to getting their portfolio live on our site," Birrell explained. The new partnership with the Gibraltar-based operator comes only two weeks after Spinomenal was able to secure a license in Greece.</p>
<p>Spinomenal has already introduced a new game this year with its latest slot, Wolf Fang – The Polar Lights. The company will look to build upon its success and carry the momentum from last year so that it continues to deliver outstanding performance and products.</p>
