<p>Additional comments from the player:</p>
<p>"Hello to you. Apologies for whatever happened but I did respond to the mail you sent. Maybe I didn't answer it fully. May I add the heading isn't quite right because it wasn't my 'winnings' have disappeared it is 50 euro that was in the withdrawal section, that was rejected for absolutely no reason. I don't have screenshots unfortunately. After I tried every avenue to get them to give me back my money, I attempted to sign in to get screenshots (which I now know I should have done immediately) and it was closed. So just to recap. I deposited a few hundred, cannot remember now, was playing and things weren't going too well, so I decided that I would withdraw 50 euro and continue playing with my balance. There were NO PROMOTIONS OR BONUSES. I never play with them, just my own money via visa debit. Then I waited the 36 hours and went to check my withdrawal had been processed and it had been rejected. From then for a couple of weeks I tried everything to get these people to give me my money, to no avail. They made ridiculous excuses. They have absolutely nothing going for them in that their responses were 'off the wall'. I unfortunately, before seeing your site, was so fed up with them, I deleted the e.mails I received from them. They also phoned twice again to no avail. They kept saying I had played and lost the money. Indeed a bit of that was true, I did play and lose, but inbetween, I had withdrawn 50 euros, which they won't pay. I only later saw Casinofreak and so many complaints about this company. I wish I had seen them before because these people are simply a scam. No they never asked me for any documents and would gladly have provided them. I never thought anything of it as I was withdrawing such a small amount that I thought they might wait until my second deposit. Nothing was ever asked of me either. Thank you Casino Guro"</p>
