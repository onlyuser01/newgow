    <h1>Hard Rock Casinos Mohegan Sun Casino Ct Tropica Casino Asheville Casino Dreams Curacao Resort Spa An</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I contacted the live chat multiple times asking for clarification, each time I was told something different.</p>
<p>A few excerpts from the live chat:</p>
<p>(04:00:54 PM) Maia: Thank you for confirming, just give me one more moment please while I check this further for you.</p>
<p>(04:00:54 PM) Maia: Thank you for the confirmation. Please give me a moment while I continue to review this for you. (translated)</p>
<p>(04:02:27 PM) Maia: Daniel, as I could see you already have sent us the requested documents, but regarding your Bank Statement **024000, we have noticed that only transactions to us via bank deposit are visible, no other Transactions are visible and it seems they might have been filtered. Our Payment Department is still looking at this and as soon this procedure is done and your account is verified you will be able to use your account normally again.</p>
<p>In case we need anything else from you we will let you know immediately, do not worry about this</p>
<p>(04:02:27 PM) Maia: Daniel, I can see that you have already sent us the requested documents, but regarding your bank statement **024000, we noticed that only transactions to us via bank deposit are visible, no other transactions are visible and it seems they might have been filtered. Our payments department is still checking this and once this process is complete and your account is verified you will be able to use your account normally again.</p>
<p>If we need anything else from you, we will let you know immediately, don't worry about it (translated)</p>
<p>(04:02:29 PM) Maia: Meanwhile, is there anything else that I can assist you with today? :)</p>
<p>(04:02:29 PM) Maia: In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today? :) (translated)</p>
<p>(04:03:14 PM) Daniel : I can also send you the entire receipt</p>
<p>(04:04:28 PM) Maia: As informed, we do not need anything else from you at this moment, in case we need anything we will let you know immediately, do not worry about this ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>(04:04:28 PM) Maia: As informed we don't need anything more from you at the moment, if we need anything we will inform you immediately, don't worry about it :) (translated)</p>
<p>I even offered to send proof again, this was declined.</p>
<p>(08:08:31 PM) Daniel : Hello Saso</p>
<p>(08:08:42 PM) Saso: How may I help, Daniel.</p>
<p>(08:08:43 PM) Saso: ?</p>
<p>(08:08:52 PM) Daniel : I Need Help: I have sent you the Source of Funds for my deposits</p>
<p>(08:09:23 PM) Daniel: I got the Info (Window when i login to the homepage) i am verified. But i dont have access to the withdrawl area</p>
<p>(08:10:23 PM) Saso: I am checking that for you now.</p>
<p>(08:11:33 PM) Daniel : Thank you</p>
<p>(08:12:14 PM) Saso: I can see that security checks have not been finished yet. We will email you once your account is verified and unblocked for withdrawals. It shouldn't take much longer now.</p>
<p>(08:13:15 PM) Daniel : okay thank you</p>
<p>(09:53:55 AM) Victor: How can I help you today?</p>
<p>(09:54:35 AM) Daniel Hi</p>
<p>(09:54:55 AM) Daniel Can you please tell me why my withdrawal takes so long?</p>
<p>(09:56:11 AM) Victor: I am afraid the verification team is checking the documents you uploaded and how to proceed, it shouldn't take much longer now. We kindly ask you for a bit more patience please.</p>
<p>So it was already confirmed here by the live chat that no more proof is required and that I don't have to send anything afterwards. All evidence was provided in a PDF file, my current salary statement shows the account I used, as well as the sales to the casino and the entries from my former BTC wallet.</p>
<p>I can make my employment contract available to the casino, but it doesn't do them much good, I'm paid according to the collective agreement, and my annual salary isn't included there, it's only mentioned that collective bargaining group XYZ is paid as a wage.</p>
<p>ID card and other documents have already been verified.</p>
<p>When I try to make a deposit I get the following message:</p>
<p>Source Of Wealth or Source of Funds document is required to complete the verification, please contact support for assistance.</p>
<p>I've been doing this for a week!</p>
