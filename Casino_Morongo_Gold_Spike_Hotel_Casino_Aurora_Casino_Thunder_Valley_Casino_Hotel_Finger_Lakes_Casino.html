    <h1>Casino Morongo Gold Spike Hotel Casino Aurora Casino Thunder Valley Casino Hotel Finger Lakes Casino</h1>

<p>888 has secured a strong executive addition to its management lineup with Vaughan Lewis now stepping in as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) for the company, and boosting its further business development and M&amp;A strategy.</p>
<p>Vaughan Lewis to Head Chief Strategy Office at 888</p>
<p>888 is bringing a new industry veteran to the company’s executive team with Vaughan Lewis, formerly of The Stars Group (TSG), now stepping in as a newly-appointed Chief Strategy Officer (CSO).</p>
<p>Lewis formerly served as a Senior Vice President of Communications at TSG before a recent merger earlier this year with Flutter Entertainment ushered in some restructuring. Yet, TSG’s position isn’t the only piece of experience Lewis brings along with him.</p>
<p>He previously worked as corporate development director for Sky Betting &amp; Gaming (SBG) and has extensive experience adapting and developing businesses. In the wake of the recent Flutter merger, Lewis focused his efforts on PokerStars and Betfair and coordinated with Dan Taylor, Flutter International’s CEO who was later appointed in August.</p>
<p>Lewis decided to withdraw from the newly-emerged behemoth in July to pursue other endeavors, and has now been recruited by 888.</p>
<p>Time to Revisit the M&amp;A Business</p>
<p>Working for 888 as the company’s new CSO, Lewis will collaborate closely with chief executive Itai Pazner and focus on boosting the company’s overall push for further business development and the M&amp;A vertical.</p>
<p>Lewis will seek closer ties with CFO Yariv Dafna, another new addition to the 888’s lineup of executives, who joined in November himself, and together the pair will spend time working on the investor relations department.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Pazner said that the company was excited to have Lewis join onboard. “Vaughan is a highly experienced gaming industry professional with a wealth of relevant expertise across both strategic development and investor relations,” Pazner added.</p>
<p>888 Holdings confirmed that the company had full confidence in Lewis’ transformative ability as part of the company. Yet, Lewis will only be joining in early 2021. Lewis himself is excited to be part of the company just as well.</p>
<p>He touted what he described as 888’s “scalable technology and strong brand and marketing experience,” and how these qualities have boosted growth and established 888 as an industry leader.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 888 has confirmed that it is interested in buying William Hill’s non-US assets, which are now up for grabs.</p>
