    <h1>Dover Downs Casino Delaware Presque Isle Downs Casino 5 High Casino Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Do</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GIG), a business-to-business provider of iGaming cloud-based product and platform services and performance marketing, has inked a partnership agreement with Portugal’s Betway operator, GM Gaming.</p>
<p>Sportnco Offers Its Solutions to GM Gaming</p>
<p>The deal will see GIG use its B2B sports betting and gambling solutions subsidiary Sportnco to power Betway’s offerings in Portugal with sportsbook and player account management solutions. Additionally, GM Gaming will move from its current sportsbook and platform. This agreement marks an extension of the relationship between GM Gaming and Sportnco. Previously, the provider assisted GM Gaming with launching in the regulated French market.</p>
<p>Sportnco was acquired by GIG a few days ago. Its new parent company is already making use of the brand to expand its reach and deepen Sportnco’s pre-existing ties with other operators.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Delighted to Expand the Deal</p>
<p>Raquel Gonçalves from GM Gaming spoke on the new deal. She said that the operator’s team is truly excited by the opportunity to continue its work with Sportnco. Gonçalves shared that she is delighted to have such a distinguished platform and tech provider on GM Gaming’s side. She added:</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to this venture which will strengthen our product offering for the Betway brand in Portugal.”</p>
<p>Hervé Schlosser, the managing director of Sportnco, is just as glad to be able to work with GM Gaming and support Betway’s brand in Portugal. Furthermore, Schlosser disclosed that he feels honored when one of Sportnco’s existing partners trusts the provider’s tech solutions and vows to take the partnership further.</p>
<p>Schlosser said that he is thrilled by the opportunities that will come from teaming up with GM Gaming and supporting Betway in the country and hopes that this is a continuation of a partnership that will prove to be long-lived.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Market Is Poised for Growth</p>
<p>Portugal is one of the most promising gambling markets in Europe. While it is not as popular as some of the largest jurisdictions on the continent, Portugal is poised for growth. The previous year saw the casino sector grow by almost a third (29.9%). The sports betting market, on the other hand, saw a 32.1% growth as well. IGaming has also enjoyed some great developments with revenues skyrocketing by multiple percent. Crucial partnerships between the biggest players in the industry have been one of the keys to this unprecedented growth.</p>
<p>Portugal’s gambling regulator, the SRIJ, recently announced a ban on live odds, categorizing them as “illegal advertisement.” It is yet to be seen whether this decision will impede the industry’s growth.</p>
