    <h1>Shreveport Louisiana Casinos Hinckley Casino Mn Main Street Casino Las Vegas Robinson Casino Hilton</h1>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>This is with reference to mya Account held with Casinofriday.</p>
<p>I had requested for withdrawal of 650euros on 4th March, which they delayed and initiated on 8th March to my Indian bank account which was received by my bank on 12th March.</p>
<p>However the payment provider of Casinofriday didn't mention the purpose code at all and when I had asked them to share correct purpose code of fund transfer cand Swift copy they kept giving me false promises for 9days that you will get it by email.</p>
<p>Yesterday on 13th March my bank had to return funds back to originator due to non availability of Valid purpose code.</p>
<p>They infact received only 615 euros instead 650euros so bank commission must have got applied.</p>
<p>I'm losing my funds as such due to Irresponsible behaviour by Casinofriday who seems to be deliberately delaying and giving wrong details of fund transfer to ensure that it will not get transferred to the player, as otherwise they would have shared the Swift copy to me immediately when I had asked for.</p>
<p>This needs immediate attention as Casino seems to be fake as they deliberately send details with wrong purpose code.</p>
