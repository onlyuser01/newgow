<p>Online casino game developer Spinomenal has confirmed a new content partnership with Bulgarian operator Palms Bet. The pair will see the studio’s portfolio of games integrated into Palms Bet’s online casino, with the content deployed with the help of CT Interactive.</p>
<p>Spinomenal is confident in the success of its titles in the Bulgarian market after achieving global recognition in numerous other regulated jurisdictions. The studio’s games are marked by a high level of detail in the graphical, sound, and gameplay execution of the game.</p>
<p>This launch with Palms Bet in Bulgaria is just a first step in the two companies' planned collaboration in the future. The pair will also be launching together in Peru and Kenya as they seek to expand their global presence and carry on in other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>Palms Bet’s players will be able to enjoy a variety of Spinomenal games, including Poseidon Rising, Majestic King, Book of Rampage, Demi Gods II, and so many more. Spinomenal has been continually designing and building games that are future-proof and created to appeal to diverse audiences.</p>
<p>Spinomenal CEO Lior Shvartz said that Palms Bet is a pioneer not just in the Bulgarian market but well beyond and that it was a great opportunity to see the supplier’s game featured with the prominent operator.</p>
<p>Palms Bet Chief Casino Operations Zhan Hadzhinikolov was similarly pleased with the opportunity to strengthen the brand’s casino operations and add more worthwhile games. Hadzhinikolov described Spinomenal’s library as a welcome addition that will increase the company’s strength and allow it to build for success.</p>
<p>This is just one of the series of similar partnerships that Spinomenal has been able to secure over the last weeks and months. The company has been determined to grow its footprint in regulated markets across the world.</p>
<p>The company expanded with Luckia in Portugal, providing the operator with a range of its games – currently counting some 300 HTML5-optimized and built titles. Prior to its partnership with Luckia in Portugal, Spinomenal also struck similar partnerships with Betshop and Alphawin, with the supplier determined to grow its footprint in Europe and beyond.</p>
