<p>The owner, developer and manager of leading entertainment resorts in Canada, Northern Asia, as well as the United States, Mohegan, was recently recognized by the annual rankings of Newsweek, a global digital news organization that reaches millions of people monthly. Mohegan confirmed on Monday that it ranked 85th place within Newsweek's annual rankings for the Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces list.</p>
<p>The latest list was developed in partnership with the leading benchmark and development research company, Best Practice Institute (BPI). It summarizes a list of businesses designated as the Most Loved Workplace based on an extensive criterion.</p>
<p>To determine the 2023 Global Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, more than 2 million people from businesses between 30 to more than 10,000 employees were interviewed. Ultimately, the list recognizes businesses and companies that show care and appreciation for their employees. At the same time, the prestigious list acknowledges companies that have captured the attention, respect and loyalty of their employees.</p>
<p>To compile the list of Most Loved Workplaces, employees were asked different questions that sought to determine how positive they feel about career achievements, their future with the company, as well as respect within different company levels. Moreover, the employees were asked about efforts related to inclusion, diversity and equity, as well as career development, among other strategic questions.</p>
<p>Nancy Cooper, Newsweek's Global Editor in Chief, commented on the topic in a statement saying: "While workplace dynamics continue to evolve, the power of a positive culture remains constant." She added that the companies that became a part of the latest list of Most Loved Workplaces stand out with their "transformative spirit." According to Cooper, this spirit helps prioritize the employees, which in turn, brings success to those organizations.</p>
<p>Louis Carter, the Founder and CEO of Most Loved Workplaces, added: "Since our initial publication of the Most Loved Workplaces List in 2021, the workplace landscape has undergone a significant transformation, including shifts like Return to Office, Hybrid Work, The Great Resignation, Quiet Quitting, and Layoffs, among others."</p>
<p>Ray Pineault, Mohegan's CEO and President, shared his excitement by saying: "I am honored and humbled that Mohegan has been named to the Newsweek Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces list and to have been ranked at 85. This is an exciting result after Mohegan was ranked among the Top 100 US Companies in 2022."</p>
<p>He explained that an ongoing goal for the company is to keep a supportive and positive workplace culture. Finally, Pineault explained that the new recognition further strengthens the company's commitment to "fostering a culture of excellence" and outlined that Mohegan is proud to be recognized by the prestigious list.</p>
