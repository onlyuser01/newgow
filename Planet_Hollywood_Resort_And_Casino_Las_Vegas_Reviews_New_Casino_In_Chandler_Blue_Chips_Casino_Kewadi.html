    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort And Casino Las Vegas Reviews New Casino In Chandler Blue Chips Casino Kewadi</h1>

<p>Pmoore8671, thank you very much for your emails. Unfortunately, the casino has to have proof that you are living at this address. The utility bill would confirm this, however, all of them are sent to your mother's name, so the casino just wants to make sure that you live with her.</p>
<p>Kristina, what has happened? Did I hurt your over-inflated ego? So, you decided to be a vindictive capital-B? You have lost all of your objectivity . Everything you've written is from the "casino's point of view". You write as if you're a "Hallmark Casino Lawyer". You state, " Unfortunately, the casino has to have proof that you are living at this address." Are you working for the casino? Why are you making demands as if you work there? I understand that casinos need proof of address. I have provided proof of address to Hallmark Casino. In the same paragraph you state, "... the casino just wants to make sure that you live with her." Which is it? Proof of Address - or - Proof that I live with my mom? Why in the heck does Hallmark Casino need to know who I live with? Come on genius, you're the one who works there, what's the logic behind that request?</p>
<p>You state, "In one message they decided to make an exception if you use Bitcoin to withdraw your winnings, so I see that the casino is trying to find the solution, and they don't want to keep your winnings." Kristina, you're not worth a damn as a "Casino Analyst &amp; Complaint Specialist". Analyst's need to be objective, thoroughly understand the requirements, and (more importantly) know why each requirement is needed. I designed computer systems for ten (10) years. I was an exceptional designer. Design is the "How" part of a system. Analysis, which comes first, is the "What" and "Why" behind a system. Unfortunately, you have missed every mark.</p>
<p>Do you actually believe, requiring a player to accept Bitcoins is fair? In Casino Guru's objectives, it states, "We believe online gambling should be fair. While this also requires players to act fairly and without malicious intent, it is mostly the casino's responsibility to make sure gambling remains fair and safe for players." You do NOT follow the goals of Casino Guru. Additionally, you have NOT done any analysis on the issues.</p>
<p>You state, "so I see that the casino is trying to find the solution". How would you know that their trying to find the solution? Is it because the casino offered to pay me in Bitcoins? That's the solution? Is there only "the solution"? How about "a solution". Being an excellent designer, there are always numerous solutions.</p>
<p>You state, "... they don't want to keep your winnings". Do you think before making a stupid statement? That statement comes from a total ignorance of the situation. Casinos do NOT want to give people money! If they "give" too much, the casino will go insolvent. All businesses need to make money! I have told you before, "actions speak louder than words". Hallmark Casino has NOT paid me one (1) penny. What's your proof that, "... they don't want to keep your winnings."? Maybe, you should go work for Hallmark Casino? You definitely have their best interests covered.</p>
<p>Finally, you state, "I would recommend you choosing one of those options - either providing the required documents or creating a Bitcoin account and withdraw your winnings this way." Who in the "hell" made you Judge, barking out orders to me? Judges should be objective, inquisitive, and fair. You are NOT objective. You are NOT inquisitive. You are NOT fair!!! To be honest, you're an extremely arrogant and prideful individual. Just wait, you'll see what God thinks about that.</p>
