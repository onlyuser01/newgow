<p>The fifth eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series is about to get underway at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, April 26. William Byron is once again listed as a heavy favorite (+300) and Timmy Hill remains the perpetual underdog with his (+700).</p>
<p>eNASCAR Talladega Superspeedway Overview</p>
<p>We havenâ€™t seen real NASCAR in six weeks after the Phoenix gig on March 8 spelled a premature end for the season â€“ or in the very least a suspension. Yet, an organization that has had its paws in many pies was able to adapt bringing the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series quickly up to speed. The virtual race at Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday, April 26, perpetuates the virtual race fever.</p>
<p>While eNASCAR was approached with just perhaps a smidgeon of skepticism at first, the event has managed to pull solid viewership, breaking a combined 1.3 million viewers on both television and live stream. Not only that, but William Byron became the first driver to win back-to-back races in the iRacing Pro Invitational series landing a flawless victory at the digital Richmond Raceway, a 154-lap race in which Byron led full 94.</p>
<p>NASCAR iRacing Odds: Talladega Superspeedway</p>
<p>Driver Odds William Byron +300 Timmy Hill +700 Kyle Busch +1000 Denny Hamlin +1000 Dale Earnhardt Jr. +1100 Ryan Preece +1200 Parker Kligerman +1400 John Hunter Nemechek +1400 Garrett Smithley +1400 Landon Cassill +1600 Alex Bowman +1800 Matt DiBenedett +2000 Christopher Bell +2500 Michael McDowell +2500 Clint Bowyer +3000 Kevin Harvick +3000 Erik Jones +3300 Jeff Gordon +3300 Joey Logano +3500</p>
<p>*Odds taken April 25</p>
<p>We have already had enough races to see a trend shape up. William Byron has been dominating every race he has joined â€“ or in the very least breathing down the neck of the first placers. Apart from winning Bristol Motor Speedway and Richmond Raceway, Byron has also led in nearly 60% of all laps clocked this season.</p>
<p>Who has the sweetest ride for @TalladegaSuperS?</p>
<p>Check out the paint schemes for this weekend's #ProInvitationalSeries race. ðŸ‘‡ â€” NASCAR (@NASCAR) April 23, 2020</p>
<p>His consistently good driving in the simulator has fetched him +300 which is a good opportunity and definitely worth placing a dollar on. Next, we have Timmy Hill. After winning the Texas Motor Speedway, Hillâ€™s name has been cited as a heavy underdog, but he hasnâ€™t quite pulled up his weight yet.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that he will try to contest the first place, no questions there. And in fact, Timmy Hill placed second in the Richmond Raceway event. He didnâ€™t lead in any of the laps, but he remained an immovable force in the second spot.</p>
<p>At odds placing him at +700, he seems a good betting eNASCAR choice. With the odds offering a better return than on Byron dollar-for-dollar, one can see why an additional bet on Hill is worth it. If still in doubt a quick drop by the NASCAR official power rankings should be of little help.</p>
<p>Kyle Busch or Denny Hamlin?</p>
<p>Kyle Busch is the only driver in eNASCAR who has consistently been cited as one of the strongest underdogs, even though he has not sealed a single title yet. Busch is once again listed at +1000 and neck-in-neck with Homestead-Miami Speedway winner Denny Hamlin.</p>
<p>Despite his success in the inaugural event, Hamlin has not been quite able to catch up. As odds would have it, Busch and Hamlin have truly been breathing down each otherâ€™s necks. Busch placed 5th in Richmond and Hamlin landed a 6th place right after.</p>
