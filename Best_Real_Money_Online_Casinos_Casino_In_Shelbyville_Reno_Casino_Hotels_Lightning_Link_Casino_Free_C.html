    <h1>Best Real Money Online Casinos Casino In Shelbyville Reno Casino Hotels Lightning Link Casino Free C</h1>

<p>I understand your frustration, but please note that the maximum bet amount is stated in the terms and you should always check the bonus T&amp;Cs before you accept any bonus. You can see it here:</p>
<p>"27.2. Bonus money: wager (wagering)</p>
<p>The process of wagering a bonus means placing a bet on a certain amount, previously described in the bonus conditions. Please make sure that you have read these Terms and Conditions, or if necessary, consult with the support service. Not all bets are taken into account. The bets from table games (Roulette, Sic Bo, Baccarat, Live Ð¡asino and others), as well as from various video poker games are not taken into account.</p>
<p>The maximum bet amount to wager the bonus is 2 EUR."</p>
<p>I assure you that the maximum allowed bet has been stated in the terms for quite some time and we also share it in our casino review.</p>
<p>Of course, we would like to see casinos implementing systems that would prevent players from placing higher than allowed bets, but, unfortunately, this is not standard practice yet. You were not stopped or blocked when you decided to increase your bet, and, as a result, you breached the maximum bet rule.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not much I can do to support your case at this time. I would strongly recommend reading all the T&amp;Cs carefully before you start playing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. Casinos try to design their bonuses to be as attractive as possible, but the rules must always be followed.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
