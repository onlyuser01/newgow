<p>LeBron and Cavs Advance to Fourth Straight NBA Finals, Warriors Look to Join Them</p>

<p>LeBron James’ Cavs have somehow managed to reach the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year. The Golden State Warriors will look to do the same tonight when they take on the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals.</p>

<p>Down an all-star in Kevin Love, and playing in Boston where a young feisty Celtics bunch hadn’t lost this postseason, LeBron willed Cleveland to an 87-79 victory. James played every second and finished with 35 points, 15 rebounds, and nine assists.</p>
<p>Coach Ty Lue said it might have been LeBron’s best game yet.</p>
<p>“He’s had a lot of gaudy games,” Lue stated. “But I just think Game 7, in Boston, all the circumstances that surround Boston, the history. To come in a hostile environment… It’s right there.”</p>
<p>Despite the Cavs being the first team to reach the 2018 NBA Finals, they’ll be the underdogs against the winner of tonight’s Game 7. The Westgate SuperBook opens Cleveland’s title chances at 17/4 (+425) for the Larry O’Brien Trophy.</p>
<p>Those odds imply a winning chance of just 19 percent. A $100 bet and Cleveland taking the best-of-seven finale nets $425.</p>
<p>Houston Has a Problem</p>
<p>Game 7 between the Warriors and Rocket tips off tonight at 9 pm ET in Houston. An electrifying series thus far, a critical component to the competitiveness of the deciding game will be whether Rockets guard Chris Paul will be able to play.</p>
<p>Paul, who is looking to reach his first NBA Finals in his hall of fame career, injured his hamstring late in Game 6. Rockets coach Mike D’Antonio said Paul’s availability will be a game-time decision.</p>
<p>Paul was acquired by Houston from the LA Clippers last June. He’s been crucial these playoffs, and has lessened the load for James Harden, the face of the Rockets’ organization.</p>
<p>Paul is averaging 21 points, six boards, and nearly six assists in the playoffs. His questionability is one reason the Warriors are favored in Game 7 despite playing on the road.</p>
<p>The SuperBook has Golden State spotting Houston six points. As for the moneyline, the Warriors are at -260, to the Rockets at +210.</p>
<p>A $100 bet on Golden State and the Warriors winning Game 7 nets the gambler just $38.46.</p>
<p>NBA Finals Odds</p>
<p>Sportsbooks believe tonight’s winner will go on to win the NBA Finals. The Warriors are currently at 5/9, and the Rockets 3/1.</p>
<p>Golden State’s implied title odds are 64 percent, while Houston’s are 25 percent.</p>
<p>Despite little faith among sports bettors, James and the Cavs are confident they can deliver the city its second NBA title in three years.</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity to play for a championship,” James said. “It doesn’t matter what the story line is going to be. It doesn’t matter if we’re picked to win or not. I’m the wrong guy to ask. I just like to compete.”</p>
<p>Lue said he always likes to have the best player on the court. And in his mind that is James.</p>
<p>“He’s unbelievable man,” Lue stated. “He’s the best player in the world.”</p>
