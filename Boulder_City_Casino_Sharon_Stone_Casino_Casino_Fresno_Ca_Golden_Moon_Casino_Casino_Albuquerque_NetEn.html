<p>Casino software supplier and developer NetEnt is partnering up with IWG. Gaming products result of the collaboration expected in Q3 2020.</p>
<p>IP Agreement Between NetEnt and IWG</p>
<p>Swedish casino giant NetEnt has signed an IP agreement with Instant Win Gaming. Under the partnership, IWG will develop instant games based on NetEnt content. The announcement came yesterday, May 11, and this move is clearly showing NetEnt’s plan to enhance its portfolio and reach more markets.</p>
<p>The first instant win games of IWG created with the help of NetEnt content are expected to be released in Q3 of 2020. The new releases will be available for the IWG network. The network itself actually includes some 21 different lotteries which cater to various global audiences.</p>
<p>NetEnt is clearly taking strategic and planned steps to expand its footprint, not least considering another recent tie-up. Just last month, NetEnt signed another intellectual property agreement with the Australian developer ReelPlay.</p>
<p>IWG CEO Rhydian Fisher commented on the IP agreement: “We’ve long been fans of the IP that NetEnt creates and to be able to offer these brands for the first time to our network of 21 lottery clients in Europe, North America and Australasia is very exciting for us, our clients and our players.” He further noted that the two companies’ teams will be working together aiming at new gaming experience for their clients and quality content.</p>
<p>NetEnt chief commercial officer Andy Whitworth also had to say: “We are happy to partner with IWG and this is in line with our strategy of widening our portfolio reach and building brand awareness in new markets. This is an important move for us as it enables NetEnt games to reach new players in the lottery sector.”</p>
<p>He continued that the partnership with IWG is not “an accident”, and said that the partner was selected in light of IWG’s proven track record in developing instant games. Whitworth also noted that “great new games” are expected to come out soon and that both companies are looking forward to releasing them to the players.</p>
