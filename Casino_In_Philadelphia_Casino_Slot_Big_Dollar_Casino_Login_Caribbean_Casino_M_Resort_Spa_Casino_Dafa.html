<p>Dafabet, a prominent sports betting operator, has reportedly extended its partnership with Coritiba FC, a Brazilian soccer powerhouse. The news, confirmed by SBC News, means that the previous partnership between the two companies will continue through the end of the year.</p>
<p>The partnership is a milestone forDafabet, which has been rather dormant when it comes to partnerships of this nature for the past six months. The last time the operator set up a partnership with a soccer club was back in June 2022, when the company signed up with Bournemouth FC, a Premier League club.</p>
<p>The news was naturally welcomed by both organizations, with Dafabet Head of Sponsorships John Cruces arguing that the extension was indeed a delightful opportunity. Cruces said that this year’s edition of Brasileirão was particularly strong and that having the Dafabet’s logos and assets displayed through Coritiba was well-timed and significant.</p>
<p>A similar tone was struck by Glenn Stenger, Coritiba FC’s President, who welcomed the extended partnership with Dafabet. Stenger explained that Coritiba is changing its business strategy to focus on existing on improving and expanding its relationships with existing partners as opposed to looking for opportunities to expand elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dafabet is signaling a strong commitment to the Brazilian sports betting market at a time when the nation is on the cusp of legalizing gambling. Dafabet was able to secure partnerships with Serie A teams Santos FC and Palmeiras, beginning to grow its position in Brazil back in 2021.</p>
<p>Brazil is a natural magnet for sports betting interests. Companies have been quick to increase their footprint in the country, fearing that they may be too late in a market that is poised to explode. Recently, EstrelaBet increased its presence in the country through a partnership with América Futebol Clube.</p>
<p>While some legal hurdles to regulating the market remain, Brazil is without a doubt set to make a big impact on the way sports betting is perceived and moderated in Latin America. The country is of interest to not just sports betting operators, but also those looking to push online casino products, poker, fantasy sports, and more.</p>
