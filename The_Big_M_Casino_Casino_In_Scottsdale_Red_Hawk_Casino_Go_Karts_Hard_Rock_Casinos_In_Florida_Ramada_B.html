<p>The leading online gambling operator, NetBet Greece, announced it joined forces with the provider of quality iGaming content, Amatic. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, Amatic agreed to supply its certified titles, powering the offering of the online gambling operator in the European country. The deal marked an important achievement for NetBet as it is expected to boost its presence in Greece. Moreover, the new content agreement complements the gambling group's ongoing plan to grow in strategic markets across the globe.</p>
<p>Amid the growing popularity of iGaming, NetBet has been expanding its footprint in jurisdictions outside the UK. Greece is one such strategic market where the gambling operator seeks to propel its presence, gaining market share and reaching new customers. Ultimately, the deal with Amatic is expected to help NetBet boost its footprint in the country while delivering exceptional experiences for the operator's growing customer base.</p>
<p>Claudia Georgevici, NetBet Greece's Public Relations Manager, commented on the topic in a statement. "NetBet strongly believes in the importance of responsible gaming, and our commitment is matched in scale by Amatic," she explained. In conclusion, Georgevici said: "This shared ambition makes them an ideal partner for a beneficial and productive relationship." Thanks to the latest agreement, NetBet's players in Greece can now visit the operator's Greek website and explore the wide range of new games provided by Amatic.</p>
<p>Amatic was founded three decades ago in 1993. Ever since the company's inception, it has been actively seeking to expand through innovation and disrupt markets across the globe. As a result, Amatic has secured a number of awards and recognitions. For example, the iGaming supplier won the 2016 ICE Gold Dice Awards for the "Best Performing Slot Machine," as well as the Irish Gaming Show for "The Most Stylish Gaming Machine In Ireland," among other accolades.</p>
<p>Late last month, NetBet announced it clinched a new deal by teaming up with IGT PlayDigital. Per the terms of that content agreement, the company expanded its footprint in Greece once again. At the time of the announcement, NetBet confirmed that it grew its games portfolio with the addition of IGT PlayDigital titles that promise to deliver exceptional, engaging and rewarding experiences. As a result of the collaboration, players of the operator in Greece gained access to hit games from IGT PlayDigital such as Cash Eruption and Cleopatra, among other fan-favorite titles.</p>
