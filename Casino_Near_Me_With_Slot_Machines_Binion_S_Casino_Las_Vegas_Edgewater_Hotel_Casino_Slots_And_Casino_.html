<p>With the National Hockey League (NHL) kicking off on Thursday, October 6, BetMGM is definitely eager to get in on the action. But sports betting is not the only way to be part of the hockey bonanza, and the company’s iGaming platform now features new and dedicated NHL casino games, which are available across several categories, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, and more.</p>
<p>They are all celebrating the beginning of the hockey season and also include a Dream Catcher-branded title which also sports the colors, signage, and imagery of the NHL. This decision was made to celebrate BetMGM’s already good rapport with the league, said Oliver Bartlett, Director of Gaming for the company.</p>
<p>All of the games have been developed together with Evolution, a company that has established itself as the de facto leader in the Live Casino sector and that continues to deliver on outstanding and tailored products for its partners. The games also have the "Go Live" feature which allows players to immediately transfer to the Live Casino version of the title they are playing at BetMGM for further convenience and more engaging experiences.</p>
<p>NHLBlackjack, Baccarat and Roulette are all outstanding products in their own right, developed well in line with Evolution’s best practices for building strong iGaming platform solutions. All of these games will add to the valuable experiences that players can have. Dream Catcher is the title that will stand out for those players who are after a fresh Money Wheel game that will now be available as well and carry the NHL branding.</p>
<p>NHL VP of Business Development Jason Jazayeri welcomed the opportunity to be strengthening the league’s position with BetMGM, an established market leader in the sports and entertainment industry. Jazayeri is confident that thanks to this new partnership, the NHL will be able to continue deepening its connection with hockey fan bases across the United States.</p>
<p>The new games are available to players in New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ontario, Canada, where BetMGM has operations. In the meantime, BetMGM remains committed to improve the sports and iGaming experience for everyone. The company runs the GameSense program which is designed to help customers stay safe.</p>
<p>This program was licensed to MGM Resorts by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation and is hailed as a significant milestone for the company in its efforts to tackle problem gambling. BetMGM is also making moves into other sports, after it opened a first NFL stadium sportsbook in September.</p>
