    <h1>Shelbyville Casino Indiana Casino Beach Pensacola Beach Florida No Deposit Bonus Online Casino Borga</h1>

<p>The Novomatic Digital Gaming and Entertainment division has further expanded its reach by deploying its online casino content with the operator in both Canada and the US</p>
<p>As a result, Greentube games will be available to Rush Street Interactive in Michigan in the United States and Ontario in Canada. This marks a major partnership extension for Greentube and Rush Street Interactive, which covers the BetRivers gaming and betting brand.</p>
<p>Action on Both Sides of the Border</p>
<p>Players in both markets will now gain access to many of Greentube’s most iconic titles, including but not limited to Thunder Cash, Clover Link, Diamond Cash, and others. The games are part of Greentube’s established jackpot series that adds tons of value to players and operators who are looking to better engage with their audiences.</p>
<p>Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant, Thunder Cash: Dolphin Pearl and Lone Str Jackpots will now all be featured as part of BetRivers Michigan and BetRivers Ontario’s portfolios. The two companies have already collaborated on a similar content alliance earlier in the year, with Greentube and RSI launching in the market in New Jersey in 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RSI has been rapidly expanding its reach in various jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, with the company now present in 15 US states, and Ontario in Canada, Colombia, and Mexico in Latin America. Extending the partnership clearly indicates that the ongoing collaboration has been largely successful and marked by important milestones and achievements for both companies.</p>
<p>Greentube sales and key account manager Jorge Bartra Quispe remarked that the new collaboration was inspired by the success of the New Jersey launch. He hailed the opportunity to expand further into the market.</p>
<p>“Our content is proven to resonate with players in the region and we look forward to rolling it out to a fresh wave of players in conjunction with our long-term partnership with RSI”, Quispe said.</p>
<p>Welcoming a Meaningful and Purposeful Opportunity</p>
<p>RSI CEO Richard Schwartz said that the BetRivers brand was one that has established itself in the North American market and was known to provide players with outstanding and exciting products. Schwartz explained:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to build on our partnership with Greentube to further strengthen our offering as we bring an exciting line-up of popular casino games to our customers in Ontario and Michigan. RSI CEO Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>He argued that the partnership extension with Greentube in Ontario and Michigan was a natural continuation of the two companies’ efforts to strengthen their presence in the highly-coveted iGaming market across the region.</p>
