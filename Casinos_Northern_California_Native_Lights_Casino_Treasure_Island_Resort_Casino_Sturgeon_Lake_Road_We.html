<p>The New York online sports betting market is hardly a week old, but companies are already giving it their all to be a part of the leading pack. After four brands have already launched, ancillary services are coming up quickly to help operators establish market dominance.</p>
<p>Affiliates Clamoring for an Entry</p>
<p>Affiliate specialist BestOdds is the latest to sign a partnership with Caesars Entertainment and FanDuel, which are looking to expand in the Empire State and boost their signups. BestOdds is bringing a range of solutions to help guide bettors to its partner brands.</p>
<p>This includes better signup offers and education information that are tailored to meet the market specifics and satisfy licensing conditions. BestOdds CEO Will Armitage commented on the opportunity to be part of the burgeoning New York market:</p>
<p>“The potential of the New York market is immense, as demonstrated by GeoComply data showing that more bets were struck in New York during its first weekend live than Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined.” BestOdds CEO Will Armitage</p>
<p>BestOdds will focus on providing bettors with state-of-the-art solutions, odds feeds, bonuses, and more. There will be comparison tools and transparent sportsbook reviews along with special offers.</p>
<p>New York’s Potential Already Shows</p>
<p>New York has proven a particularly busy market for bettors shortly after launch. GeoComply, a software solution company that ensures that people bet within whitelisted jurisdictions, shared a video demonstrating the spike in activity on Saturday, January 8, which was the first day of betting activity.</p>
<p>Affiliate companies have already pushed their brands into the market, with Better Collective already securing several prominent partnerships of its own in the Empire State.</p>
<p>Better Collective has information about 500,000 people interested in sports betting in New York, and the legalization of the online gambling market will allow the company to make good full use of that.</p>
