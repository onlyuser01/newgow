<p>Barcelona was better equipped to host ICE than London, Clarion MD Alex Pratt said</p>
<p>ICE, Clarion Gaming’s famous B2B industry show, will no longer take place in London. After careful consideration, the company decided to relocate the event to Barcelona starting in 2025. Clarion Gaming noted that it also considered either moving the event to Madrid or Paris, or keeping it in London.</p>
<p>The company noted that its iGB Affiliate conference will also move to the capital of Spain’s Catalonia region. The events will be hosted there for five years, in accordance with the agreement with Fira de Barcelona, the city’s trade fair institution.</p>
<p>Equimore, a proven event specialist, will assist Clarion with its relocation project. The move was greenlit by ICE’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iGB L!VE will instead relocate to London in 2025.</p>
<p>The Relocation Will Create New Opportunities for the Industry</p>
<p>Addressing the elephant in the room, Alex Pratt, Clarion Gaming’s managing director, said that the event will relocate to Barcelona because of the city’s “world-class facilities, outstanding hospitality infrastructure, logistics, ROI for customers and ability to scale.”</p>
<p>The move will effectively conclude a 12-year tenure at ExCeL London. Instead, the event will now be hosted at the 240,000-square-meter Fira de Barcelona property. The 2025 edition of ICE is planned to run for three days between January 20 and 22.</p>
<p>In addition, the move will form an alliance between the international gaming industry, Fira de Barcelona and stakeholders across Spain. Finally, Clarion Gaming noted that ICE and iGB Affiliate will be the only major events in Barcelona at the time, providing the industry with additional exposure.</p>
<p>Pratt added that all four cities on Clarion’s shortlist had submitted “highly professional and impressive bids.” As a result, the decision to move the event to Barcelona didn’t come easily.</p>
<p>In the end, Clarion decided that Barcelona was “the best equipped” to be ICE’s strategic partner for the future. Pratt thanked ICE’s stakeholders for helping Clarion reach a decision and Equimore for its assistance.</p>
<p>The process [of selecting a location] enabled us to identify the city that our customers believe is best equipped to be our strategic partner for the future and is able to host two world-class events which meet the needs of businesses of all sizes and locations across every part of the gaming and ICE community. Alex Pratt, MD, Clarion Gaming</p>
<p>In the meantime, iGB L!VE will move to London in 2025. Previously hosted in Amsterdam, the event will now be hosted at ExCeL London. Pratt noted that his team believes ExCeL London to be a “great destination” and believes that it will provide an amazing backdrop for the event.</p>
<p>Now that Clarion Gaming has reached a decision, it will focus on organizing next year’s editions of ICE and iGB Affiliate. For reference, the first event will run from February 6 to 8, 2024, while the latter will follow on February 7-8.</p>
<p>In other news, Clarion Gaming recently extended its ICE agreement with the European Casino Association.</p>
