<p>The incumbent CFO will leave the company on July 31 after ensuring a smooth transition of responsibilities</p>
<p>NeoGames, a supplier of end-to-end online gaming and iLottery technology, has introduced changes to its leadership team. As announced, the company will appoint Motti Gil as its new chief financial officer, replacing the outgoing Raviv Adler.</p>
<p>Adler will explore other opportunities and is stepping down effective July 31 this year. During the time before his eventual departure, the outgoing CFO will work with his successor to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities.</p>
<p>The new appointment, NeoGames added, is still subject to certain regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Following the appointment, Gil will be responsible for the company’s finance. Luckily, he is a seasoned executive with over two decades of experience in global finance and operations. His career started with Ernst &amp; Young, after which he spent seven years as the chief financial officer of GoNet Systems. During that time, he assisted the wireless tech company in controlling its finance.</p>
<p>In 2016, Gil entered the gaming industry and joined Aspire Global, which is currently owned by NeoGames.</p>
<p>CEO Malul Welcomed the New CFO</p>
<p>NeoGames’ chief executive officer, Moti Malul, welcomed the new hire to the company. He pointed out that Gil has been with the company for seven years thanks to his time spent as the chief financial officer of Aspire Global. CEO Malul praised the new appointee’s way with finance and said that Gil will be tasked with taking care of important financial operations.</p>
<p>He has continually demonstrated exceptional financial acumen and leadership skills throughout his tenure. He remains instrumental in overseeing critical financial operations and has strong relationships with key stakeholders. Motti is the ideal candidate to step into this role at this time. Moti Malul, CEO, NeoGames</p>
<p>The CEO used the opportunity to thank Adler for his hard work and contributions to the company. Malul praised the “immense impact” the outgoing CFO has had on NeoGames’ success.</p>
<p>His unwavering dedication, strategic insights, and exceptional leadership have been instrumental in shaping our Company and in delivering value for our shareholders. We are genuinely thrilled for Raviv as he embarks upon a new opportunity, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. Moti Malul, CEO, NeoGames</p>
<p>A week ago, NeoGames agreed to supercharge PlayLive! Online Casino with content through its Aspire Global subsidiary. Around the same time, the tech company became the latest member of the United Lotteries for Integrity in Sports organization.</p>
