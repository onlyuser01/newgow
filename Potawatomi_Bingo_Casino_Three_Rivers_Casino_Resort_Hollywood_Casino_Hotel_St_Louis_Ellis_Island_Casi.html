    <h1>Potawatomi Bingo Casino Three Rivers Casino Resort Hollywood Casino Hotel St Louis Ellis Island Casi</h1>

<p>Lindsjö is a well-seasoned industry veteran who has spent more than eight years with the company and is climbing up the pecking order</p>
<p>Lindsjö has been involved with the affiliate operations of the company for a very long time and will now help steer the overall affiliate strategy for Videoslots.com. The company was recently buffeted by a financial settlement with the UK Gambling Commission as well, making Lindsjö’s role all the more responsible at a time of increased scrutiny for the operator and its brands, including affiliate partners.</p>
<p>Scaling and Adjusting Videoslots.com’s Affiliate Strategy</p>
<p>Lindsjö has been able to already organize the working process in the affiliate department, promoting affiliate managers over the past weeks. His appointment took effect earlier this year but was only revealed by the company today.</p>
<p>The man will be tasked with developing Videoslots’ affiliate platform and migrating existing operations to a new solution. He will leverage a number of tools to help streamline the partner list and ensure that Videoslots is experiencing sustained growth. His career with the company goes all the way back to 2015 and he has been an important driver of the affiliate division’s success over the past years.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Videoslots deputy CEO Ulle Skottling said that Lindsjö was very well-versed in the company’s affiliate culture, and his promotion was a testament to the hard work he has been putting in since he joined. Skottling added:</p>
<p>With Kim at the helm, the affiliate team is in good hands and he has some fantastic plans moving forward that will strengthen our reputation. Videoslots deputy CEO Ulle Skottling</p>
<p>Videoslots Is Poised to Expand in a String of New Markets</p>
<p>Lindsjö was similarly excited about the prospect of being a part of this new chapter of the company and his professional journey. He said that it was a great way to celebrate his part of the company so far and help boost the affiliate side of the business.</p>
<p>“We are entering new markets, meaning we need to find quality affiliates within these regions. This involves traveling, attending conferences and a lot of negotiations and testing, which I am really looking forward to,” Lindsjö said, excited about the company’s future prospects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has faced some challenges in regulated markets, including a €9.9 million fine in the Netherlands that the operator said it would seek to challenge.</p>
