    <h1>Hollywood Casino In Joliet Casinos In Santa Fe Casino Columbus Pa Casinos Casino Los Angeles Colossu</h1>

<p>Colossus Bets is undergoing some restructuring, AGBrief reported with the sports jackpots and technology solutions provider preparing to see David O’Reilly and Eva Karagianni-Goel, both C-level executives, step down from the team.</p>
<p>C-Level Executives Depart, Internal Talent Takes Over</p>
<p>This will trigger internal reorganization with CTO Paula Cara Farcas taking over O’Reilly’s functions as a chief executive officer. Company CIO and CISO Alberto Zuin will fill in for company CTO Laurence Jones, who will shift into the position of CPO.</p>
<p>The internal arrangement was commented on by Colossus founder Bernard Marantelli who offered insight into the departure of the C-level employees and what lay ahead for the company. He also commented on the appointment of Farcas as the new CEO.</p>
<p>Marantelli has offered nothing but praise for Farcas’ experience as CTO, having helped build and control the company’s entire technology stack. He added:</p>
<p>She combines a deep understanding of our world-leading technology with strong commercial acumen, which makes her the natural choice to lead Colossus into the future. Colossus founder Bernard Marantelli</p>
<p>Marantelli added that he was thankful to have mentored a strong talent team internally and that all the hard work that has been put down will now continue to pay off through the repositioning of internal assets. “We could not have done better by looking externally on any level,” Martinelli concluded confidently.</p>
<p>Farcas was equally pleased to step in at the helm of Colossus Bet. She welcomed the opportunity to work alongside people who have been part of the company for a long while and understood its needs as well as shared its culture.</p>
<p>Farcas Welcomes the Changes and Restructuring</p>
<p>She also expressed her appreciation for having worked with O’Reilly and Karagianni-Goel:</p>
<p>I would like to thank Eva and David for their multiple contributions over the past years and for leading the company to the stage where it is today, serving tens of partners and thousands of users globally. Colossus CTO Paula Cara Farcas</p>
<p>Fracas added that Colossus Bet was in a very strong position to continue building up and scaling its significant IP and technology assets. The company is heading into the US market these days, confident that its products across numerous important business verticals, such as tote, pools, and cash out will find a new home in the market.</p>
<p>The company is still awaiting regulatory approval to go ahead with its pool betting products in the US and negotiating deals with operators. All changes in the shift of positions are expected to take place in September.</p>
