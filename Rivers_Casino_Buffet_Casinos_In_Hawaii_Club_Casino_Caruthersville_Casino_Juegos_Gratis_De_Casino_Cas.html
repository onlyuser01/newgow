<p>After a four-week summer break, the 2023 season of Formula 1 is back with the Dutch Grand Prix, which is on the program on Sunday, August 27</p>
<p>The Dutch Grand Prix was first held in 1950 but was removed from the calendar in 1986 only to return in 2021. Itâ€™s been held twice since, with Max Verstappen winning each time. The Dutchman is the No. 1 favorite to win it again, but itâ€™s not just because of the great history heâ€™s got with the track at Zandvoort as youâ€™ll learn by reading our 2023 Dutch GP preview.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Max Verstappen is a -400 Favorite</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is sitting top of the F1 Driversâ€™ Championship with 314 points after 12 events. Thatâ€™s 125 points more than Sergio Perez whoâ€™s in second place. What this means is that he only needs a couple of more wins to make sure the trophy stays in his possession.</p>

<p>So far in 2023, the Dutch driver has already won 10 races, while in the two that he did not win, he finished second. All this makes explains why heâ€™s seen as a -400 favorite to triumph at Zandvoort Circuit on Sunday, but is there someone who could ruin his plans?</p>
<p>Verstappenâ€™s teammate from Red Bull Racing, Sergio Perez, would definitely love it, and the same goes for two British drivers, McLarenâ€™s Lando Norris and Mercedesâ€™s Lewis Hamilton.</p>
<p>Can Anyone Ruin Verstappenâ€™s Plans for Sunday?</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is the king of Formula 1, but when youâ€™re on the throne everyone wants to throw you off it. However, only one driver managed to finish a race before him this season.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s his Red Bull teammate, Sergio Perez, whoâ€™s the only other driver to win an event this year. Actually, he did it twice â€“ in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>When it comes to the podium finish, there are another six drivers who have finished second or third at least once in 2023. Among those are Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris, both of whom have upped their form in the last couple of months. But is their form good enough to challenge for the top spot on the podium this coming Sunday?</p>
<p>2023 Dutch GP Prediction</p>
<p>Knowing that heâ€™s won each of the previous eight Formula 1 races, it would be crazy not to assume Verstappen is going to do it again. Plus, heâ€™s driving in front of his crowd on Sunday, which is another incentive for the Dutchman to win.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Verstappen to win</p>
