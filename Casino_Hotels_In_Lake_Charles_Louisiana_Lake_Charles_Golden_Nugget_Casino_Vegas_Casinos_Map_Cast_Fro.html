    <h1>Casino Hotels In Lake Charles Louisiana Lake Charles Golden Nugget Casino Vegas Casinos Map Cast Fro</h1>

<p>Good afternoon, I want to share that I've been having issues verifying my account so I can subsequently withdraw my money. They ask me to verify the bank transfer, where I send them the bank statements which include all details and the deposits made on November 30th. But every time I send the information, it gets rejected with reasons stating that the document should reflect a deposit to Mr bet. I contacted my bank regarding this and they informed me that the deposit will not appear in this way since the payment is made through an intermediary on webpay. To support my claim, I've attached bank statements reflecting the transfers and the emails of successful transactions that the casino itself sent me, along with verification emails from the intermediary who makes the payments all detailed with screenshots of my account and of the transaction history at mrbet where successful transactions are registered. It's frustrating when they automatically deduct at the time of deposit but delay withdrawals with these kind of paperwork requests. I understand these measures are for security purposes, but what more do they want than this? It seems like they are just making excuses to not process the withdrawals, especially considering a month ago they issued a withdrawal of 489,000clp without asking for any documentation and deposited it within less than 24 hours. I hope that I can get some help in resolving this tedious verification process.</p>
