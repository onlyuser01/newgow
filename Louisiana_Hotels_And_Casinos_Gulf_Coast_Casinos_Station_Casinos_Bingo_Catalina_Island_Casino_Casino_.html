<p>Salsa Technology, a LATAM-oriented provider and aggregator of iGaming solutions, has expanded its local reach through a new deal with the Brazilian platform provider Weebet. The agreement will help both companies augment their presence in the region.</p>
<p>Salsa to Provide Weebet with a Vast Array of Content</p>
<p>Under the deal, Weebet will receive access to Salsa Gator’s selection of acclaimed iGaming titles. The solutions provider’s content is tailored to the needs of LATAM players and will enrich Weebet’s offering.</p>
<p>This will help the platform provider enhance its portfolio and make sure that the online casinos powered by the Weebet platform have the content they need to engage their audiences. The platform company powers brands like Alfasports.net, Betei.bet and Mjrsports.com, to name a few.</p>
<p>The integration of Salsa Technology content will provide Weebet with a plethora of titles from some of the best contemporary iGaming studios. This will include games from over 70 third-party fan-favorite developers such as Betsoft, Habanero and 7Mojos.</p>
<p>In addition, the agreement will see certain Weebet clients gain access to Salsa Technology’s impressive range of video bingo games. This will include titles such as Cuca’s Swamp Bingo, Halloween Groove and Jogo dos Bichos Praia.</p>
<p>The Agreement Will Benefit Both Parties</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies commented on the new agreement, expressing their excitement about the deal. For example, Weebet’s chief executive officer, Lenildo Nogueira, said that his team feels “privileged” by the opportunity to work with Salsa Technology and receive access to its critically-acclaimed content.</p>
<p>According to Nogueira, both companies share the same vision. He praised Salsa Tech for the quality of its content and said that it is an unrivaled powerhouse offering superior localized content. Nogueira concluded that he is looking forward to providing its clients with titles developed or aggregated by Salsa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eliane Nunes, the head of marketing and sales at Salsa Technology, said that her company “shares the same LATAM DNA” as Weebet, confirming Nogueira’s words. Because of that, Nunes is thrilled to engage in a partnership with the platform provider and provide it with a suite of carefully-selected content from her company’s rich portfolio of localized games.</p>
<p>Nunes is sure that Salsa Technology’s content, which is curated for the preferences of LATAM gaming enthusiasts, will help Weebet and its partnering brands grow.</p>
<p>In other news, last year, Salsa Technologies further enriched its aggregation platform, adding titles from Dragon Gaming to its portfolio.</p>
