<p>Entain’s Ladbrokes Coral is raising the standards across its retail betting shops, welcoming punters back with the Racing Post Digital Betting Shop Display (BSD) system, part of the company’s print-to-digital initiative.</p>
<p>Racing Post’s Digital BSD System Rolls out at Ladbrokes Coral Shops</p>
<p>Ladbrokes Coral continues with its shift towards print-to-digital solutions with the introduction of a dedicated Racing Post Digital Betting Shop Display (BSD) system across eight properties in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Racing Post BSD seeks to empower the consumer experience and contribute to the creation of a “betting shop of the future” experience, European Gaming has said in a report.</p>
<p>While the Racing Post BSD has been an integral part of the sports betting industry in the region, the addition of a brand-new Racing Post Tipping Zone which adds expert advice from the likes of Paul Kealy and Tom Segal is new and an opportunity for consumers to gain access to actionable sports insights.</p>
<p>Consumers who are less competitive in nature will find new content available via Racing Post’s interactive touchscreens, which will include Verdicts and Spotlights, leading to better overall decision-making process on the part of punters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Racing Post’s Spotlight Sports Group has been looking to develop and empower new retail consumer solutions. Thanks to the alliance with Ladbrokes Coral, Spotlight has been able to do extensive testing and adjust its solutions, content and actionable tidbits of information leading to better-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Commenting on the success of the solution and Ladbrokes’ ambitious to boost a next-generation experience for retail customers, Spotlight Sports Group Retail Director Alan Pepperell had this to add:</p>
<p>“With betting shops across the UK and Ireland closing for long periods of time this year, it’s vital that they now offer the best customer experience to welcome customers back.” -Spotlight Sports Group Retail Director Alan Pepperell</p>
<p>Pepperell was happy with the fact that Ladbrokes Coral has chosen to trust Racing Post and Spotlight Sports Group to deliver a bespoke retail experience and boost engagement with customers.</p>
<p>Recently, Spotlight Sports secured a content partnership for betting tips with another leading industry household name, Paddy Power.</p>
<p>Raising Industry Standards and Charting the Future</p>
<p>The executive expressed confidence that the new BSD is a ground-breaking technology raising standards for all industry players, and offering customers distinct benefits. These benefits include but aren’t limited to race information enhanced with actionable tips, all available at the touch of a button, Pepperell added.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes Coral parent, Entain, commented on the partnership, with the company’s Retail Product Manager Toby Cook expressing confidence that Racing Post updates are the way to engage with customers, owing to the solution’s high popularity and proven track record with the betting public over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>“Now we’re delighted to be moving with the business as we continue our digital journey,” Cook added. Cook had no doubt that Racing Post’s product will help the company extend the success of similar solutions already deployed across its betting shops in London and Dublin.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes has been innovating its retail product over the past year to stave off a number of calamities, from a global pandemic to stricter regulatory measures.</p>
