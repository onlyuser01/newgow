<p>Soft gaming content pioneer 1X2 Network has joined forces with SkillOnNet, a software solution provider to some of the largest online casino brands on the market.</p>
<p>PlayOJO, Lord Ping, Slingo, and Turbonino to Utilize 1X2’s Portfolio</p>
<p>1X2 Network has reached an agreement with SkillOnNet, to bring the 1X2 partner network of games to SkillOnNet-affiliated casinos. As a result, numerous online casino brands, including PlayOJO, Lord Ping, and Slingo, and Turbonino will have access to enjoy 1X2’s hefty portfolio of casino games, not least Iron Dog Studio titles.</p>
<p>Some player-favorite games here are Battle Maidens Cleopatra, Rainbow Wilds, Blood Queen, and Viking Wilds. There are also 1Million Megaways BC, and Pirate Kingdom Megaways that will now be available through the partnership.</p>
<p>The Branded Megaways slots are already available on established iGaming brands. Those include LuckyNiki, PlayOJO, SlotsMagic, MetalCasino, AHTIgames, MegaCasino, SpinGenie, Drueckglueck, SlotsMagic, SwiftCasino, and Turbonino. A non-branded SkillOnNet megaways game will also be available for the Network to promote.</p>
<p>The outstanding Branded Megaways product gives casinos the ability to design unique slots using their logo and color scheme and extend the available paylines to over a hundred-thousand options.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet’s Michael Golembo commented on the contract: “We have built a reputation for offering our operator partners and their players the widest range of quality online slots and casino games, and this deal with 1X2 Network shows our continued commitment to providing this.”</p>
<p>Golembo shared his excitement about the Branded Megaways concept. He explained that the product was revolutionary for casinos that want to have bespoke Megaways™ slots.</p>
<p>Branded Megaways™ Games Are Becoming Increasingly Popular</p>
<p>Recently, SkillOnNet has become one of the leading casino platform providers on the regulated market. The company has a portfolio of more than 3,000 games and offers localized payment options and 24/7 customer support.</p>
<p>1X2 Network has been developing cutting-edge HTML5 casino solutions and has a diverse portfolio of slots, sports, and table games. Plus, the company has had numerous successful integrations of late.</p>
<p>1X2 Network’s Chief Commercial Officer Kevin Reid expressed his confidence that the new tie-up with SkillOnNet would prove to be a mutually-beneficial partnership for the companies as the network’s games will be accessible to more players. At the same time, SkillOnNet will have more quality content for its partners.</p>
<p>Reid mentioned 1X2 Network’s Branded Megaways games as some of the most played games of the year. He expressed his happiness that so many casino operators have decided to offer them to their customers.</p>
