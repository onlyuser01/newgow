    <h1>Canada Casinos Free No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Usa 4 Queens Casino Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Rem</h1>

<p>Romanian iGaming brand and operator Princess Casino has expanded its library with the addition of new games by Stakelogic, a respected supplier of online casino titles. The partnership will see Stakelogic provide the brand with both its video and classic casino slot content and offer its titles to Princess Casino players for the very first time.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has built a reputation for its library and content offer with numerous games, such as Mutl6Player, Multi4Player, Big Runner Deluxe, and others. The supplier has focused on developing and building games that are intuitive, out-of-the-box, and bring added value to operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>To this end, Stakelogic has been actively looking to expand its selection of titles, including already-established player hits such as Treasures of Ra, Bison Blocks, Money Track 2, and more. Megaways iterations of Stakelogic will also be available with Candyways Bonanza 3 Megaways, for example.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Princess Casino Head of CRM DanielaAsaftei said that her company has been following the string of recent successes by Stakelogic. This publicity paired with Stakelogic’s unfaltering commitment to building an advanced gaming product has motivated the company to tie the content knot.</p>
<p>"They really do provide an online slot experience like no other, especially when Super Stake is activated taking the anticipation of bonuses and big wins to the next level," Asaftei mused, hailing Stakelogic’s commitment to building original features and content. Ultimately, this partnership is designed to help bolster Princess Casino’s own standing in the Romanian iGaming market, she concluded.</p>
<p>Stakelogic’s Senior Sales Manager, Danila Dzehs, expressed similar confidence and excitement about this opportunity. Dzehs hailed the fact that this was the first time that the companies had collaborated.</p>
<p>He promised that Stakelogic would continue to strive and exceed player expectations through this new collaboration. "We look forward to seeing players at Princess Casino see why our games are so much fun to play," Dzehs wrapped up.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has been building up its footprint in Europe, with the company recently signing another content alliance in Denmark, one of the region’s best-regulated and most lucrative markets. Stakelogic teamed up with Royal Casino, bringing its selection of games locally. The supplier also sought to amplify its reach with a tie-up with Aspire Global, strengthening its reach a notch further.</p>
