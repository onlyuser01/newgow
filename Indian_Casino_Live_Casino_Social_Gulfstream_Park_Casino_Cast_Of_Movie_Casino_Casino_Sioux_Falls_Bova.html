    <h1>Indian Casino Live Casino Social Gulfstream Park Casino Cast Of Movie Casino Casino Sioux Falls Bova</h1>

<p>The casino black jack game is most definitely rigged at this casino. I deposit 5-10 thousand dollars a month with this site and have been a loyal customer for over a year. They have shown many signs of shady activity thruout the time I’ve been a member mainly with the live dealer games but recently I have started playing the virtual blackjack game to avoid the glitches and bugs and freezes and the over all shady things that occur in the live game. The other day I played and I’d win one and lose three win another lose a few and so on and so on.. I was hovering a little under my initial amount when all of a sudden I lose like 18 hands in a row . And when I say lose I mean that the casino "miraculously" was able to get either blackjack 21 or 20 in every one of the games and I would get 12,13,14 etc there was a stretch of them getting blackjack 4 straight hands. The other hands it didn’t matter if I hit , stood, doubled I would end up with a dismal hand and they somehow had black jack or a pair of K or 10 or whatever the combo .. now look I get that the casino is going to win and even win multiple hands in a row .. but 18-20 straight hands all of which they got either bj 20 19 and I’m gonna bust or get 13 or some bs hand ? There’s no way that’s mathematically possible . ESP getting 4 straight bjs it just isn’t even remotely possible . It’s rigged period . I called them to ask for a refund and to inform them I knew something was fishy and they basically told me I was wrong and a liar and that they use a " random number generator " blah blah blah.. look there’s no random number generator in existence that would do that unless it wasn’t a random number generator and that it was doctored to benefit the casino . I mean they are the ones that control the games do they think we’re so stupid to realize they can adjust or tighten up the virtual games lol? I explained to them how much money I spend there and how rudely and unfairly I felt I was being treated and was then hung up on. I’ve never been so angry in my life . The woman kept telling me ... well you wagered this amount during your time of okay so you obviously won because you only deposited xx.xx .. I’m like look that’s besides the point ! I’m not arguing that anything was shady before those last 18-20 hands just the ones that I lost consecutively and where they somehow got 19,20,21, and bj that many times in a row and she just laughed and said she understood my frustration and she would be frustrated if she lost money too but couldn’t explain to me how the random number generator just happened to play out like that. This casino has no respect awful customer service zero appreciation for loyal and high spending customers and are a scam and a rip off and a joke and need to be exposed and people need to know what they’re getting into before they too get taken advantage of. Thanks for your time .</p>
