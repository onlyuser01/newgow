<p>The latest financial penalty follows the Dutch regulator's goal to ensure only licensed operators offer services to customers in the country</p>
<p>The Dutch Gaming Authority, the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), announced Thursday it imposed a multi-million fine against online gambling operator Gammix Limited. The fine dates back to a probe from June 2022, when the KSA found that the operator offered its services to customers in the Netherlands without the necessary license.</p>
<p>As a result, the gambling watchdog warned the operator would be subject to a periodic financial penalty of €1,470,000 per week, up to a maximum of €4,410,000. That would apply unless Gammix discontinued offering services to Dutch customers. Just like with other similar cases, the KSA provided a period during which the operator can comply without the penalty coming into effect.</p>
<p>However, this week, the KSA confirmed that it has once again probed into the operations of Gammix and determined that the operator continues to offer its services to customers in the Netherlands. It said that Dutch customers can create an account via the company’s website and play. Keeping in mind that to offer their services in the Netherlands, operators are required a license, the KSA said that Gammix is subject to a penalty payment of €4,410,000.</p>
<p>The Gambling Regulator Continues to Monitor the Market</p>
<p>René Jansen, KSA’s chairman, explained that the Authority remains committed to fighting against illegal gambling in the country. He outlined that imposing financial penalties against operators that do not comply with the regulations is an effective way to reduce the illegal offering to Dutch customers.</p>
<p>Jansen pointed out that since Gammix’s violation continued, the KSA had to take further action, which is the implementation of the maximum financial penalty. He said that operators that violate the rules cannot just ignore the period payment penalties. Finally, Jansen said that operators that violate the rules or continue to do so must pay their penalties.</p>
<p>“We have to press ahead when combating illegal supply. An order subject to periodic penalty payments is often effective within administrative law to stop a violation.“ René Jansen, chairman of the KSA</p>
<p>According to the KSA, Gammix previously disagreed with the initial penalty but that plea was rejected by the regulator. “Because Gammix has not paid to date, the Gaming Authority has now decided to collect the amount due. Gammix can still challenge the collection decision,” explained the KSA.</p>
<p>Details of the new penalty emerged after earlier this month, the KSA imposed penalties surpassing $27 million against five different online gambling operators. At the time, the watchdog said that the companies offered games of chance for Dutch customers without the necessary license.</p>
