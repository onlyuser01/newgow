<p>Ahead of Super Bowl LVIII, one of the most anticipated football events across the United States, TUMS, an antiacid brand, joined forces with DraftKings, the leading betting and gaming operator, for the launch of TUMS Prop Bites, a new free-to-play game. The game, described as a “first-of-its-kind platform where fans can make their free food picks and see how they stack up against the rest of the nation,” offers a chance for lucky players to win a share of a $10,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Players of TUMS Prop Bites can try their luck and pick which foods are at the heart of America’s hearts and stomachs. The free-to-play game launched earlier this week and will be available through February 11, 2024, the date that marks the start of Super Bowl LVIII, also known as the Big Game. Bettors and sports fans alike who would want to try their luck can do so before kickoff. Once the Super Bowl starts, the TUMS Prop Bites will close.</p>
<p>To ensure more entertainment for Super Bowl and football fans, DraftKings and TUMS organized a kicking-off Big Game Weekend. The duo agreed to host the TUMS Prop Bites Food Casino at Circa Stadium Swim in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The exciting event will take place on February 9, 2024, between 12 PM and 6 PM and will feature Desus Nice, the famous comedian. Guests who attend the event will be able to participate in games for free which would grant them a shot at winning different prizes.</p>
<p>Besides participating in the TUMS Prop Bites Food Casino, the famous comedian was designated as the Official TUMS Prop Bites Tipster. He will engage in different social media activations and digital content, ahead of the Big Game.</p>
<p>The Game Promises Exceptional Experiences for Sports and Food Fans Alike</p>
<p>Jay Danahy, DraftKings’ head of brand partnerships and operations, spoke about the importance of the Super Bowl for the company every year. He added that DraftKings is thrilled to team up with TUMS and release TUMS Prop Bites, a free-to-play game that lets “food fans get in on the competitive action on game day and leading up to it.” Last but not least, Danahy pointed out: “Food is a key part of the Big Game experience for fans watching at home and TUMS Prop Bites creates an authentic extension of what DraftKings is all about, providing customers with more ways to engage with the events they love.”</p>
<p>Jissan Cherian, TUMS’ senior director, digestive health, was similarly thrilled regarding the new collaboration with DraftKings. He said that the new game offers another form of entertainment for football fans, in addition to their favorite foods. Finally, Cherian reminded that TUMS helps fans by offering relief from heartburn.</p>
