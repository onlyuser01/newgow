<p>William Hill continues to consolidate its influence in the United States’ betting and iGaming climate. With the newly-minted deal between the company and Golden Entertainment, the British headquartered company has tangibly expanded its influence in Nevada.</p>
<p>William Hill Continues to Grow in Nevada</p>
<p>As of this week, Golden Entertainment sportsbook and race operations are controlled by William Hill, marking a yet another significant achievement for the company in the United States. In total, William Hill has added four new locations, to name:</p>
<p>Arizona Charlie’s Decatur and Arizona Charlie’s Boulder, Las Vegas</p>
<p>Casino and SkyPod, the STRAT Hotel</p>
<p>Aquarius Casino Resort, Laughlin</p>
<p>Casino and SkyPod hasn’t started working yet with an early launch planned for March 2019. This is one of the most expensive properties in the state, acquired back in 2017.</p>
<p>Apart from running the day-to-day affairs in the new venues, William Hill will ensure top-notch betting software, a mobile wagering app, as well as in-play options.</p>
<p>Golden Entertainment, Inc. COO Steve Arcana expressed his satisfaction with his company’s choice of partner:</p>
<p>We are excited to continue expanding our relationship with William Hill, which has a proven sports wagering platform not only in Nevada but around the world. We look forward to growing our business in Nevada and other jurisdictions through this partnership.</p>
<p>William Hill’s US CEO Joe Asher also shared his content with the new opportunity offered by the partnership and said the following:</p>
<p>We look forward to working together to offer sports fans an amazing experience for many years to come in Nevada and elsewhere as opportunities arise</p>
<p>Amid the strengthening of its Nevada operations, William Hill has been issued a “Buy” rating on its stock by Jefferies Financial Group and several other credit agencies, indicating another upswing for the operations on the financial end for the company.</p>
<p>Prior to their new partnership, William Hill was already running a number of properties, including:</p>
<p>Lake Side Casino &amp; RV Par</p>
<p>Pahrump Nugget Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall</p>
<p>Gold Town Casino</p>
<p>William Hill is also operating 80 betting kiosks located at Golden Entertainment properties and some of the third-party properties that serve as proxies for the company to advertise and spread its sports betting offer.</p>
<p>In January, William Hill struck a partnership with Prairie Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino even though there was nothing to suggest that the state would adopt sports betting any time soon. A new bill has since emerged with Senator Roby Smith, Chair of the Committee on State Government, outlining a future for the industry.</p>
