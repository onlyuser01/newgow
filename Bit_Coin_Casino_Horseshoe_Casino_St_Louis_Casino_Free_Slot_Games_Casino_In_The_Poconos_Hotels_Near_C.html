    <h1>Bit Coin Casino Horseshoe Casino St Louis Casino Free Slot Games Casino In The Poconos Hotels Near C</h1>

<p>I requested a withdrawal back in December 2023 for 100. I then canceled it and won more. It was in separate amount ie. I won 150, withdrawel request, won 100, withdrawal request to the total sum of 600. I put 100 back and left it as 500 withdrawal request. I lost my bank card. After them telling me my pending withdrawal is with the finance team and kept saying 'be patient '.</p>
<p>I was very pateint, over a month now infact, since the first request. They have now today blocked me from being able to access my account, or email customer services. I have more screen shots to send as proof.</p>
<p>They claim I need to prove I was the owner of the card that was lost (and still looking for) so I need to go to my bank for proof of ownership. I have sent bank statements showing the deposits I have made to Goldwin.</p>
<p>The first two times they were rejected by finance. I sent photos of my card front and back on from my app. One team member from the live chat asked for photo of front and back of card, and the cvv number. I was then 3rd time asked to send it with it covered. I have sent photos of the front and back of card via my banking app.</p>
<p>They said as mentioned I have to go to bank and get a proof of ownership of the lost card which I was in the process of doing. They have now today however blocked me from being able to access my acount after logging into the chat this evening and blocked me from being able to email their customer support. Please help, I'm so frustrated with this now. Many thanks, Ruth P.</p>
