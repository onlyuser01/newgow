    <h1>Hinkley Grand Casino Lake Charles Casino L Auberge Excaliber Hotel Casino Casino Florence Oregon Sha</h1>

<p>3DS works when I made deposit it’s goes my security 3dS it’s comes up I put pin code you get access payment some reason internet connect like doesn’t connect its fails on player account it’s fails ! Then goes payment system his trying again then you get access it’s goes right ! Still show fails on players then goes payment system his recognises it’s pass because you have 3DS security pass but not think his fail on players account ! It’s easy to find I give you my last 6 months statement from bank then you can open my players history payments and you can see and find out balance who will be made that’s time ! And you can see if the payment goes that date then on information you can see what’s time will be made all easy to search! It never goes up 2 months ! Your accountant need change sooner as possible! If you can’t get this thinks done then I not give you good reviews on other players then they have the same problems and you said sorry we can’t do nothing payments goes 3 DS security and that’s it ! Then ggbet get some sorry job done properly find out why? Who? What’s goes wrong because in your clients thousands on risk to will be charged next for nothing! Fails system and only what you can see it’s 3DS security! Find out ! I will waiting for money back! Need sorted this thinks out if not I will go look some advice for this thinks to be done ! Looking for true on gaming commission if you don’t have anything to said like 3DS security</p>
<p>they are not late notification because I spoke and open investigation on my bank for this transaction! And they said it will be taken out automatically without 3 DS security like it’s goes like charge for something and they said if they have bank card details then it’s simple charge without any client access ! Because on 3DS security goes straight on bank and it’s happen that time that date ! Then it will be see on your bank statement this case it will charge for ggbet client because you have my bank card details !</p>
