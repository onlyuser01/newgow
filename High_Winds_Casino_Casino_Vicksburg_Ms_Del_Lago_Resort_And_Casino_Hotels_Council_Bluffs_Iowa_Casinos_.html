    <h1>High Winds Casino Casino Vicksburg Ms Del Lago Resort And Casino Hotels Council Bluffs Iowa Casinos</h1>

<p>Good evening I am writing on this forum for the first time, I would like to make you aware of my story for two reasons.</p>
<p>the former keep you away from National casino</p>
<p>the second seek help.</p>
<p>Last night I was playing on monopoly where I won the sum of 120 thousand euros, I tried to make a withdrawal and after a while I discover the bitter surprise of having the winnings seized from National casino. The reason ?</p>
<p>I was playing with a bonus of 15 euros from them which, in order to be withdrawn, needs to finish a replayed round equal to 600 €. I would say that I have exceeded it by far. Their motivation was that I have exceeded the bet of € 5 (which is forbidden by them if you have an active bonus) on evolution gaming (monopoly) despite their terms and conditions specify that live dealer games do not achieve the achievement. of the bonus.</p>
<p>consequently one would think that these money played on monopoly have no bet limitation as they are not eligible for the bonus.</p>
<p>in addition this win that evolution gaming has paid them what will happen to the pockets of National casino?</p>
