<p>Apparat Gaming has launched October Bier Frenzy, a new slot with a big win potential ahead of the Munich Oktoberfest</p>
<p>The iconic slot developer “with a German accent,” Apparat Gaming, has launched its freshest game, October Bier Frenzy, right on time for the upcoming Munich Oktoberfest, one of the biggest events of its kind worldwide.</p>
<p>The game blasts a feel-good Bavarian brass band party soundtrack that instantly makes players want to grab a beer and join the funfair that gives a sense of home and hospitality to all participants.</p>
<p>However, the soundtrack and the visualization of the party theme connected to the prestigious festival in Germany are not the only things players should be looking forward to. The slot also scores many points in the big win potential and bonuses categories.</p>
<p>In July, Apparat Gaming released 7 Supernova Fruits featuring Supernova Wilds and a maximum win of 1,000x.</p>
<p>October Bier Frenzy Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>5 Rows: 3</p>

<p>Let the Anstich Begin</p>
<p>On September 16, thousands will gather to witness the hammer being swung and the iconic Anstich (tapping) unfold in front of their eyes while religiously counting the exact number of strokes needed to get the beer flowing.</p>
<p>If you cannot take part in the historical countdown that will take place out loud, you can grab your favorite beer and pretzels and jump in on the action on the reels in Apparat Gaming’s freshest release.</p>
<p>Set across a standard 5×3 grid and counting 10 paylines, October Bier Frenzy comes with a special Beer Frenzy feature. To trigger it, players need to land at least three Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>Once the feature is activated, the Bavarian brass band music will turn into a popular party song you would normally listen to during the Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>Once the Free Games are awarded to players, they can collect all the Beer symbols seen landing on the reels. By scooping up 40 such symbols, they will receive 10 extra Free Spins. At the same time, winnings from the Beer symbols will be automatically multiplied by x2, x3 or x10.</p>
<p>Players can trigger the Free Games up to three times for a maximum win potential set at 4,500x and as many as 50 Free Games in total.</p>
<p>If the Beerman wild symbol makes an appearance during the Free Games, he will start to drink all Beer symbols around him while Collecting all of the symbols’ values.</p>
<p>Provided a Wild symbol pops up on the grid but there are no Beer symbols around, the Beerman will be seen cheering the bar with a “Prost” (“cheers”) while turning random symbols into Beer symbols prior to collecting their values.</p>
<p>Players can also opt for the Buy Bonus feature to immediately activate the Free Spins and the Collection features.</p>
<p>The New Slot “Puts Players in the Middle of the Party”</p>
<p>The studio’s co-founder and director, Alina Dandörfer, spoke about the new release as one that will throw players straight in the middle of the Oktoberfest party, where they can “expect beer, bonuses and plenty of big wins,” all part of the playful game with high volatility.</p>
<p>Dandörfer also praised the trademark German accent used to create the slot, which resulted in the top-quality gaming experience, appealing visuals, excellent engineering and “absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever.”</p>
<p>In August, the company announced it would extend its foothold on the Swiss market by inking a deal with Grand Casino Baden. During the same month, Apparat released the news that it would be powering SkillOnNet’s DrückGlück brand with its content.</p>
