<p>More than 50 gambling associations and operators have expressed their support for 2023’s #EmbraceEquity campaign</p>
<p>Just ahead of this year’s International Women’s Day on 8 March, the gambling industry led by the All-in Diversity and Square in the Air projects has once again shown its support for this year’s campaign dedicated to celebrating women in the gaming industry all around the world.</p>
<p>Continuing Last Year’s Successful Collaboration</p>
<p>The All-in Diversity and Square in the Air projects have once again reunited for another successful campaign in 2023 after their lucrative collaboration last spring resulted in a successful video campaign released just before International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>This year, the two parties are determined to celebrate a series of personal stories and achievements of women who have brought their contributions to the industry. While similar to last year’s campaign, as explained by All-in DIversity project’s co-founder Tina Thakor-Rankin, their fresh partnership with Square in the Air will be slightly different from last year’s campaign.</p>
<p>If last year’s video campaign was aimed at emphasizing a series of shocking personal experiences lived by women as part of the betting and gaming industry, this year’s shared project will throw more of the focus on the excellent achievements reached by women in the sector.</p>
<p>As explained by Thakor-Rankin, the 2023 #EmbraceEquity campaign will showcase the industry’s wish to embrace equity in its entirety while also proving the way women’s personal experiences are prone to make them stronger.</p>
<p>In February, Better Collective announced it would join All-in Diversity Project as a founding member.</p>
<p>Big Names on the List of Supporters</p>
<p>Once again, the successful #EmbraceEquity campaign will receive the help of a number of big operators on the market, with names like Betsson, PokerStars, BetMGM, and Entain among the announced supporters joining the #GamingAsOne hashtag.</p>
<p>Godolphin Racing and the British Horseracing Authority have embraced the #AllintheRace hashtag, joined by prestigious regulators including the Malta Gaming Authority and the Massachusetts Gaming commissions. Clarion and Better Collective are additional companies that have joined the rest of the supporters.</p>
<p>Square in the Air’s creative director Ellen Kirby expressed their own views on the support shown by the gambling industry for the new campaign, calling their actions “encouraging”. Kirby also spoke about the “incredible achievements” shared by women from all parts of the world as part of the new campaign, explaining the initiative will be primarily used as a reminder for women to keep celebrating their stories, personal experiences, and one-of-a-kind strengths.</p>
<p>On March 8, the complete list of all the gambling operators and organizations that have supported the campaign will be made public on special media, together with companies the wonderful achievements and experiences of the women part of the campaign.</p>
<p>In 2021, GGPoker celebrated International Women’s Day by hosting a $10,000 tournament and donating some of the buy-ins to different global charities.</p>
