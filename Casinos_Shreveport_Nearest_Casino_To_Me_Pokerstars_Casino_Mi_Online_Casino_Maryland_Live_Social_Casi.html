<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I played online at Casino Winfest.</p>
<p>I had already made a Auszalung, but then canceled it because I still wanted to play something.</p>
<p>It was not a bonus active!</p>
<p>I have with the canceled withdrawal amount (250 €) then 800 € then I also wanted to pay out, so I put the 800 € in the payout.</p>
<p>Everything works great, I thought.</p>
<p>Then a little later, I looked in my e-mail inbox and had mail from Winfest Support.</p>
<p>I am suddenly told by an employee Sandra that I would have violated the bonus conditions, I would have allegedly played with a bet per spin of over € 5 which would not be allowed if you (and now it comes) has an active bonus. Therefore, the payout is canceled and the prize is confiscated.</p>
<p>So, since I have earned this 800 € with a canceling payout, there may have been no bonus active.</p>
<p>You can also see it in the screenshots, 250 € Canceled and thus 800 € and paid.</p>
<p>This was but then simply canceled by Winfest and cleared to 51 €.</p>
<p>Then we come to the next and the alleged over 5 ¬ bet I should have played per rotation ... my highest set bet were 2,10 € as you can see on the screenshots I have uploaded.</p>
<p>So you dear people, yes, keep your hands off this casino.</p>
<p>I've never experienced such a fraudulent handling at any casino.</p>
<p>Something like that definitely belongs to the net.</p>
<p>You have to lock this casino so that something does not happen even more often.</p>
