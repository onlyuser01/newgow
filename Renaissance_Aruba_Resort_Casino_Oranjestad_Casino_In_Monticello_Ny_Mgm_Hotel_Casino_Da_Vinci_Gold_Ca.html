    <h1>Renaissance Aruba Resort Casino Oranjestad Casino In Monticello Ny Mgm Hotel Casino Da Vinci Gold Ca</h1>

<p>I've been a member of Jazz Casino since 2021. I always played blackjack and hardly anything else. I'll usually win around $1000 here and there, sometimes $500, and quit early. never had a problem getting paid. This time I decided to play on and not quite early. From November 17, 2023 - November 19 2023 I went on a crazy run. Everything was clicking! My side bet (pair &amp; 21+3) was hitting, My hands were hitting and the dealer was busting! I also pay 2/3 hands at a time. I double often and split often. By Sunday I had about 30K in my account. all from blackjack and I played for hours and hours each day. The balance would go down and up. down and up but I mostly came out on top!</p>
<p>They ended up freezing my account and said it was for "routine review" and come back in 24 hours. this was Sunday night/ Monday morning. I thought cool they were probably checking if I was cheating or laundering money which I was doing neither so I thought nothing of it. 24 hours go by my account is still locked. I call they say "Congratulations on your winnings and your account will be unlocked in 24 - 48 hours. " I say fine I'll call back on Monday. I have nothing to hide. I played fair and square.</p>
<p>I got a call from NICK on Friday informing me that I didn't win 30K in blackjack because there was a glitch between Fresh deck and jazz casino accounting.</p>
<p>He says some of my winnings were paid out double and some of my bets did not withdraw from my balance. He then said we recalculated all of the bets and that I actually owed the casino $1100 he was sorry for the inconvenience and would zero out the account for me.</p>
<p>I told him that it was impossible! I won too many side bets to have lost not including the double downs and splits that I won. It is impossible for me not to have one, and I never won more than I was supposed to and they withdraw all of my losses from my balance each lost!</p>
<p>I told him to please send me a spreadsheet of all of my bets. He sent 3 spreadsheets, 2 contain all my bets of what really happened and 1 contains what Jazz Casino created from the bets. I think they just made something up to try and cover them.</p>
<p>I am currently going through the bets that actually happened that they are saying is wrong &amp; they are all correct and adding up. I was not paid double or more than I was supposed to and on every loss they withdrew from my account.</p>
<p>They are trying to stiff me!</p>
