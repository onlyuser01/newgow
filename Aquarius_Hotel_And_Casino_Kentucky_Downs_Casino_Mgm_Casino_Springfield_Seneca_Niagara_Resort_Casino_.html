<p>Stakelogic Live has been granted a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission, marking its entrance into the Greek live casino market</p>
<p>The Hellenic Gaming Commission, which is the independent administrative authority responsible for granting online gaming licenses and suitability licenses to operators in Greece, has given the green light to industry-leading live casino content provider Stakelogic Live.</p>
<p>The in-demand supplier of premium live content has announced it is getting ready for the official launch in the country. The license allows Stakelogic Live to introduce its top content to Greek players via any licensed online casino.</p>
<p>In August, the company inked a content agreement with Starcasino, strengthening its foothold in Belgium.</p>
<p>One month earlier, in July, the company announced it would extend its presence in Romania by integrating its content with Princess Casino.</p>
<p>In May, Stakelogic’s games became available to players in the country via MaxBet.ro, a well-known local operator with a deep reach with local players.</p>
<p>The New License, a “Huge Step Forward for Stakelogic”</p>
<p>As described by the company’s chief executive officer, Stephan van den Oetelaar, the fact that Stakelogic Live managed to secure the license from the Hellenic Commission represents “a huge step forward” for them.</p>
<p>The CEO also commented on their ongoing activity in Greece in the past two years which has allowed them to successfully introduce their products to players in the market.</p>
<p>Now, the same players will have a chance to enjoy the studio’s live casino streams broadcast from top-tier studios located in the Netherlands and Malta, where Stakelogic has already scooped up a license from the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>What Greek Players Can Expect</p>
<p>Besides iconic game shows including Super Stake Roulette 5000x, Speed Baccarat, and Super Stake Blackjack and standard live games like Auto Roulette, American Blackjack, and European Roulette, Greek players will also enjoy the brand-new Super Wheel bonus feature.</p>
<p>The latter is a money-wheel bonus which has already turned into a “core feature on Stakelogic Slots.”</p>
<p>The provider, who is well-known in a number of critical European markets, has used the voice of its CEO to express their excitement about Greek players being able to finally enjoy their ”premium, industry-leading live casino content”.</p>
<p>In September, Stakelogic Live confirmed the launch of an innovative live casino Bonus Tool that would enable operators to more easily manage their promotions and reward systems while boosting fan engagement.</p>
<p>The news came in the context of the increasing demand for better player engagement tools that can maintain players’ engagement via customized offers, and it followed the promotion of Dejan Loncar to the position of head of live casino.</p>
