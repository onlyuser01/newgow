<p>theScore Bet Plans to Launch Sports Betting in Colorado by the End of August</p>
<p>Score Media and Gaming Inc subsidiary, theScore Bet received approval to launch online sports betting in Colorado. The announcement came yesterday following the green light of the Colorado Division of Gaming (CDG). theScore Bet said that the approval came because the company’s sports betting product meets the requirements of Colorado sports betting rules and regulations. Furthermore, the theScore Bet said that it “substantially demonstrated to the satisfaction” of the regulator.</p>

<p>“We can’t wait to launch theScore Bet in Colorado later this month and showcase our incredible betting product to the passionate sports fans there.” said theScore CEO John Levy</p>
<p>He continued by saying that the regulator’s approval is “another significant step” towards the company’s plan for multi-state expansion. In conclusion, Levy said that the company will continue to roll out: “uniquely integrated media and betting experience across the country.“</p>
<p>In order to access the market in Colorado, back in January theScore Bet signed an agreement with the gaming operator Jacobs Entertainment Inc. In Colorado Jacobs Entertainment operates two casinos – The Gilpin Casino and The Lodge Casino. Elsewhere, in New Jersey, theScore Bet received approval by the regulator last August. After that the company launched its sports betting product in the state in September.</p>
<p>Colorado’s Sports Betting Market Continues to Grow</p>
<p>Back in November 2019, people of Colorado voted to legalize sports betting in the state. State officials set a plan to launch sports betting on May 1 in the Centennial State. The plan did go ahead as expected and the state’s legal sports betting market launched on May 1.</p>
<p>In May this year, bet365 signed an agreement with Century Casinos in order to enter the Colorado market. However in order to start operating in the state, bet365 will need to apply for a license from the state regulator. Once the company receives the license it will be able to launch sports betting services.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the giant DraftKings already launched mobile sports betting in Colorado back in May. Back then, DraftKings co-founder and president Matt Kalish said that the company is:</p>
<p>“thrilled to introduce Colorado’s passionate sports fans to DraftKings Sportsbook, the nation’s favorite mobile and online sports betting platform.”</p>
<p>The giant William Hill also entered the sports betting market of Colorado. Last month, on July 24 the operator launched six betting kiosks in two gaming properties – Isle Casino Hotel and Lady Luck Casino. The company picked the perfect timing to launch its sports betting as back in July, the Major League Baseball (MLB) had just returned.</p>
