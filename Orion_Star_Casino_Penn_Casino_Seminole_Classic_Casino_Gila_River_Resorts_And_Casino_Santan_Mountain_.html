    <h1>Orion Star Casino Penn Casino Seminole Classic Casino Gila River Resorts And Casino Santan Mountain</h1>

<p>Between 19 and 31 December 2020, the customer raised several complaints with our customer service team as well as the curacao Egaming directly, regarding the operation and/or outcome of three separate games accessible via our website, all of which are provided by reputable third party game suppliers;</p>
<p>Each complaint raised requires an escalation to, and investigation by, the respective game supplier. Regrettably, we have no influence over the length of time, or amount of effort, that is required for our partners to be able to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to respond to such complaints. That being said, the complaints in question were handled as follows:</p>
<p>Complaint 1 – received 19 December 2020 re. ROULETTE, the customer complained that bets were being rejected/not accepted. This complaint was immediately escalated to the relevant game supplier who was able to confirm that a bet, which should have been accepted as properly placed, would have been a winning bet. These winnings were credited to the customer’s account on 28 December 2020. This matter is considered to be resolved;</p>
<p>Complaint 2 – received 21 December 2020 re. MAGIC MIRROR, the customer complained that winnings received should have been greater than they were. This complaint was immediately escalated to the relevant game supplier who was able to confirm, on 22 December, that the game had functioned properly and that the winnings were correct. The customer subsequently supplied a video of the gameplay that they alleged had generated an incorrect win amount; this was again referred to the game supplier who, again, was able to confirm that the game had functioned properly and that the winnings were correct. This outcome was communicated to the customer on 25 December 2020. This matter is considered resolved;</p>
<p>Complaint 3 – received 31 December 2020 re. LION THUNDER, the customer complained about a session of gameplay from 19 December 2020, claiming that the game was malfunctioning and was not playable. This complaint was immediately escalated to the relevant game supplier who was able to confirm that, for an unknown reason, the game had stopped functioning for the customer during a play session. Accordingly, on 12 January 2021 the customer’s account was credited with an amount equal to the bet which was in play at the time of the malfunction, per our terms and conditions. This matter was considered resolved at this time, however the customer continued to contact our customer services team complaining that matters were not resolved.</p>
<p>On 21 January the customer provided additional information which allowed the game supplier to investigate further and confirm that, in all likelihood, had the game not ceased to function when it had, the customer would have won a certain amount. Notwithstanding that our contractual obligations to the customer had already been fulfilled by refunding the aforementioned bet, on 25 January the customer’s account was credited, in good faith, with an amount equal to the likely winnings that the customer could have expected to receive, as communicated to us by the game supplier. This matter is considered to be resolved; and</p>
<p>All complaints have been fully investigated, and dealt with appropriately, in a timely manner. Accordingly, we consider this matter to have been duly investigated, and our obligations to the customer in question properly and entirely fulfilled and, as such, we do not believe that any further action on our part is required at this time.</p>
