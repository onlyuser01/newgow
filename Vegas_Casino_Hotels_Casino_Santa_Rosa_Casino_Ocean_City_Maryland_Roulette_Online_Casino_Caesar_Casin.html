<p>Gambling addiction is likely to continue to grow in the United States, not least because efforts to tackle and address the issue are only now coming to light, and because of the rapid expansion of the regulated market. To respond to this trend, efforts to protect consumers from this newly-presented challenge are beginning to take shape.</p>
<p>Although a federal initiative has long been called for by state problem gambling NGOs, charities, and state-backed initiatives, an effort to finalize and introduce such a solution is finally underway in 2024.</p>
<p>This is the so-called GRIT Act, which stands for Recovery, Investment, and Treatment, pitched by US Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and US Representative Andrea Salinas of Oregon which has been welcomed by the National Council on Problem Gambling, an organization that deals with gambling addiction in the United States on all of its levels.</p>
<p>The GRIT Act calls for the introduction of a guided approach that operates on a national level and that seeks to prevent, treat, and research gambling addiction and how it impacts consumers. This is the first vocal attempt to ensure that the problem is addressed with funding from the federal government, as some 7m American adults are estimated to be suffering from the issue, but the actual numbers are still elusive.</p>
<p>Plus, these numbers do not factor in the so-called at-risk groups, which may become addicted to gambling. This is doubly important now more than ever as the NCPG indicates that the number of people at risk of developing a more serious problem gambling has increased by 30% between 2018 and 2021, the time when SCOTUS overturned PASPA and sports gambling became legal in the country.</p>
<p>However, the tremendous explosion in new opportunities for placing a bet has not been reciprocated by sufficient funds to go into helping treat, analyze, and prevent gambling addiction. In outlining the GRIT Actâ€™s importance, NCPG President of the Board of Directors, Susan Sheridan Tucker, said that the piece of legislation is precisely what is needed to ensure a long-term support for fighting and overcoming gambling addiction.</p>
<p>"We commend Senator Blumenthal and Representative Salinas for their dedication to addressing the burgeoning public health crisis of gambling addiction. The National Council on Problem Gambling stands in full support of this legislation, recognizing its potential to make a lasting difference in the lives of individuals and families across the nation," Tucker added.</p>
<p>The Act itself is an expansive draft that seeks to address the societal costs of problem gambling. One of the proposals wants to see 50% of the federal sports excise tax revenue that goes to gambling addiction treatment and research, controlled by the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The legislation adds that 75% of the funds will be distributed through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant program, with the remaining 25% going to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. The funding going to tackle problem gambling should be allocated for a period of ten years with reports within 3 years of the effectiveness of the undertaken measures.</p>
<p>Keith Whye, Executive Director of the NCPG, also welcomed the opportunity to see meaningful and impactful federal legislation passed on the highest level to address the lingering problem of gambling addiction. He, however, was confident of its potential success.</p>
<p>"This landmark legislation sets the stage to significantly bolster gambling addiction prevention, research, and treatment resources and positively impact individuals and communities nationwide," Whyte explained.</p>
