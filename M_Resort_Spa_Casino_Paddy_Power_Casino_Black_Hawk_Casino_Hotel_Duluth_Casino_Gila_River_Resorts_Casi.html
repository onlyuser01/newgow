<p>The iGaming and online sports betting company’s Director of Product bid farewell to the company, ready to embark on the next stage of her professional journey</p>
<p>During her three years at Rivalry, Tersigni contributed to the company’s impressive growth as it prepares for another successful year. The former Director of Product’s time with the operator was a significant boon to her career, seeing her reach new professional heights. Tersigni did not share any specific plans going forward but used the opportunity to thank her colleagues, expressing confidence in Rivalry’s enduring success.</p>
<p>Rivalry Benefited from Tersigni’s Diverse Expertise</p>
<p>Amanda Tersigni commenced her journey with Rivalry in December 2020, initially joining as a Product Manager. Before her stint with the esports betting operator, she held significant product-focused positions across Toronto. Notable among these were roles at Achievers, a software development firm, where she worked as a Senior Technical Product Manager, helping deliver sustainable, data-driven business results.</p>
<p>Her other notable experience includes positions in UpHabit, Yulio Technologies, and Pixel Tours, businesses centered around innovative design and emerging technologies. Such diverse expertise was the perfect launching point for her career at Rivalry, allowing her to fully immerse herself in a new and exciting industry where she could further hone her skills.</p>
<p>The journey at Rivalry.com was filled with amazing growth and challenges that helped me evolve, both personally and professionally in ways that I never could have anticipated. Amanda Tersigni</p>
<p>Demonstrating her proficiency and commitment, Tersigni rapidly ascended within Rivalry’s ranks. By December 2021, she had risen to Senior Product Manager. This ascent continued as she assumed the role of Director of Product in June 2023, signifying her growing influence and leadership within the organization. Her contributions helped propel Rivalry during the company’s most successful period.</p>
<p>The Company Is Well-Positioned for Further Growth</p>
<p>Despite not disclosing her next career move, Tersigni announced her departure from Rivalry, showing gratitude for her personal and professional growth and evolution during her tenure. In her LinkedIn post, she reflected on her exciting time with the company, expressing confidence in Rivalry’s team and foreseeing remarkable achievements in the coming years.</p>
<p>The operator had a stellar 2023, achieving several milestone successes. November saw the company secure a CAD 14 million (roughly $10.23 million) investment for an undisclosed existing institutional shareholder, intended to fund general working capital and corporate purposes. This boost should further bolster Rivalry’s impressive momentum, helping secure its market position amidst growing competition.</p>
<p>The departure of Amanda Tersigni marks a transition for both her and Rivalry, underlining a period of evolution and development for the organization. Her impactful contributions and leadership will undoubtedly resonate with the company’s future endeavors as it maintains its focus on customer engagement and satisfaction via exciting new developments.</p>
