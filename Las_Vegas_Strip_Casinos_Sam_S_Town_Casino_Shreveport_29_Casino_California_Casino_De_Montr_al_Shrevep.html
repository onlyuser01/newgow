<p>BetMGM introduced a new marketing campaign last week featuring Wayne Gretzky and Connor McDavid, two prominent faces in hockey and legends in their own right. The campaign launched just in time for the National Hockey League season, which is due to start on Monday, October 10.</p>
<p>New BetMGM Celebrates Launch of NHL Season</p>
<p>The spot focuses on both characters’ anecdotical and humorous interactions, which nevertheless inescapably pivot towards the BetMGM app, which Gretzky previews and effuses about throughout the spot. The ad was produced by 72andSunny New York, and it was directed by Peter Berg.</p>
<p>Commenting on the ad, BetMGM VP of Brand Raymond Doyle paid his compliments to the final product and what it means from a fan’s standpoint:</p>
<p>It’s incredible to showcase two of the greatest hockey players on-screen interacting with one another. We look forward to entertaining hockey fans during commercial breaks as two of the game’s legends blend sports and entertainment and demonstrate the endless possibilities with BetMGM. BetMGM VP of Brand Raymond Doyle</p>
<p>The ad is also part of the “IT’S ON” campaign and it reflects BetMGM’s commitment to introducing its products to audiences with the help of prominent personalities from the world of sports and entertainment. BetMGM has built on an impressive portfolio of brand ambassadors, including Kevin Garnett, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Foxx, Jalen Ross, and so many others.</p>
<p>Both McDavid and Gretzky have been happy to assist BetMGM’s growing reach as a source of some of the best betting opportunities and activities. The spot itself is fully focused on the app and it is designed to extoll its virtues and functionalities, making it the go-to option for players who are still looking for the “right” app for themselves.</p>
<p>Marketing in US Sports Betting Is Evolving Quickly</p>
<p>In the meantime, companies in the United States are having a careful think-through as to what works best. In other words, spending on marketing campaigns and bonuses is no longer the norm as consumers have grown weary of those. Rather, companies should find another angle to connect with audiences instead.</p>
<p>One of those is clearly creating imaginative commercials and spots that rivet the consumer’s attention while subtly highlighting the benefits of using one product over another. Recently, PointsBet embarked on something similar but ended up deciding against a TV spot that was “too outside of the box.” Instead, the company shared a revised version with TV networks but still kept the original for its social media channels.</p>
