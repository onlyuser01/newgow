<p>Mustang Gold review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>"Think when we speak of horses, that you see them printing their proud hooves in the sand," wrote Shakespeare. Well with Mustang Gold, you needn’t stress your imagination too much, because this slot is wall to wall horses.</p>
<p>Mustangs are the feral horses that charge up and down America’s grassiest lands. Notable as a symbol of American freedom and Westward expansion, they are here put alongside cowgirls and boys, ace to ten symbols in that saloon sign font you know from the movies and toasty cookout campfires.</p>
<p>If you manage to collect highly valued Money symbols, big win is assured</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>All of this is rendered in the uniquely American style of patriotic spraypainted murals, which tend to look a little tacky on the reels, but are ubiquitous when it comes to US themed slots.</p>
<p>The music is delightful with dirty steel guitars, a jaunty whistle and a tune that puts you on horseback in Monument Valley.</p>
<p>The animations are smooth and neat, without being flashy or dragging the win cycle out too much. Overall, Mustang Gold enjoys decent design all round.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The base game of Mustang Gold is a pretty standard five-reel slot, with three rows. There are twenty-five win lines.</p>
<p>There is also a free spin bonus and fixed jackpots (details below).</p>
<p>It’s breaking no new ground, but Mustang Gold is a pretty solid little game that should keep most players attention.</p>
<p>Symbol Collect appears only on reel five</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol can appear on reels two to five and substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol, Money symbol and the Collect symbol.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol can appear on reels two, three and four, and will pay out an amount equal to your bet per spin and trigger the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>The Free Spin bonus starts with eight free spins. Hitting three or more Scatters during the Free Spins will add another eight free spins to your total, with no limit on how many times this can be retriggered.</p>
<p>The Money symbol falls only on reels one to four, the Collect symbol lands only on reel five. During the free spins, extra Money and Collect symbols are added to the reels.</p>
<p>You'll collect all Money symbols if you hit the Collect symbol</p>
<p>Each Money symbol comes with either a random value or the word "Jackpot". If you hit one or more Money symbols on the same spin as a Collect symbol, the values on the Money symbols are paid out, and you receive one Jackpot Bonus Round for each Money symbol with "Jackpot" written on it.</p>
<p>Each Jackpot Bonus Round gives you a grid of twelve symbols. You click on symbols to reveal which of the four jackpots is under each symbol, and the player received the first jackpot which comes up three times.</p>
<p>The jackpots are fixed at 1000x, 200x, 100x and 50x your bet per spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.53%, a little higher than our yardstick of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.25 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The jackpot feature of of Mustang Gold generates a medium-high volatility in the game overall, which is at the low end of what works with our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Mustang Gold slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mustang Gold is a fun, jackpot centric, medium-high volatility slot with a decent RTP. As such it is something we can recommend to the cowgirls and cowboys in our readership who are looking for a slot that truly captures the feeling of chasing wild horses across magnificent scenery, only with a lot less rough sleeping and tinned beans.</p>
