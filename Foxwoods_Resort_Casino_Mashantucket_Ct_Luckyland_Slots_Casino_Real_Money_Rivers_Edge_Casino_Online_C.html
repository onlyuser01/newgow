    <h1>Foxwoods Resort Casino Mashantucket Ct Luckyland Slots Casino Real Money Rivers Edge Casino Online C</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>the casino accuses me of having a duplicate account.</p>
<p>This was already clarified with an employee (Dario) at the turn of the year and from that point on there were no problems.</p>
<p>Also, I've been checking in and out since then.</p>
<p>So far this week.</p>
<p>I had a withdrawal of €491 and deposited €997.</p>
<p>I played normally on the site and couldn't log in the next day.</p>
<p>When I then asked in the chat, it was said that I had violated the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>But not what exactly I would have done wrong.</p>
<p>Even now repeated inquiries leads to no success.</p>
<p>I'm actually trying to clarify the situation, but I don't see any effort from the casino, even though I can clearly identify who I spoke to.</p>
<p>In addition, the casino wants to keep my money. That's not legal.</p>
<p>It is not an authority and I deposited and used my own money to play.</p>
<p>€1500 is not a small amount of money and in no way constitutes an appropriate "fee" for an alleged misconduct on my part.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will file a criminal complaint if my money is not paid out to me.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to support me as I am reluctant to take legal action</p>
