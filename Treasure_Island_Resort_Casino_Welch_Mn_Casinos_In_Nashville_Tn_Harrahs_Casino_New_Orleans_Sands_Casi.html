<p>BetMGM, a fast-evolving and growing online gaming and betting brand that recently embarked on its international expansion journey in the United Kingdom, has teamed up with Inspired Entertainment to introduce a new and unique Hybrid Dealer game, the companies shared in a press release seen by Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>The new title, MGM Bonus City, taps into Inspired Entertainment's innovative and cutting-edge Virtual CGI, green screen technology, and not least – footage of real dealer, in a way that reminds what Real Dealer Studios does.</p>
<p>BetMGM is proud to have the opportunity to bring this new concept to North American markets through the introduction of the Hybrid Dealer genre, creating fresh opportunities and out-of-the-box excitement for its customer bases in key jurisdictions such as New Jersey, but also planning to roll out the product in Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>BetMGM Senior Director of Gaming Oliver Bartlett was very happy to see the new MGM Bonus City introduced to the company’s offering. It’s a way to experience MGM Resorts’ Las Vegas’ casinos in a new way, Bartlett assures. The game can also be seen as part of the G2E expo at Inspired Entertainment’s stand.</p>
<p>As to Inspired Entertainment, company CEO and President Brooks Pierce was happy to see MGM Bonus City come to fruition, leveraging what he described as the revolutionary Hybrid Dealer tech.</p>
<p>"Our patented technology offers unparalleled opportunities for our customers to provide a realistic ‘as live’ experience to players without the costly logistics of dedicated studios and staffing," he continued, highlighting the strengths of the title, and the brand-new game genre that players can now enjoy.</p>
<p>What makes the game and the underpinning tech so special is that they "transport" players to various locations in Las Vegas, including the New York-New York, Luxor, Bellagio, or MGM Grand through the unique property-themed bonus rounds available in the game. Players will spin a wheel with eight possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Each of the outcome will get a special multiplier before a spin begins, offering players some neat surprises along the way. Inspired Entertainment has mixed both physical and digital elements to create a refined live dealer experience. The hybrid genre does not require a live dealer studio to run, as it’s based on Random Number Generator technology, but it still draws inspiration from this segment.</p>
<p>Overall, the game is a new concept that will be piloted at a time when live dealer experiences are gathering momentum and companies are seeking to differentiate their products and stand out.</p>
