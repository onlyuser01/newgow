    <h1>Live Roulette Casino Stratosphere Hotel Casino Las Vegas Casino War L Auberge Casino Lake Charles Re</h1>

<p>I had a nice win on cash bandit 3, enough to start betting big, managed to get up to 13000 dollars,</p>
<p>I played it down with big bets to $8500 hoping to jag another win.</p>
<p>The ozwin site then ended my play and went offline for around an hour,I received an email from ozwin saying I'm apparently having trouble signing in and to reset password, which wasn't the case, all my details were correct , it was on their end that any problems stemmed from.</p>
<p>When ozwin came back online my winnings were taken out of my account and only the original 80 dollars remained.</p>
<p>80 dollars with no bonus attached to it.</p>
<p>Any communication with them is pointless, any evidence that any of this happened has been removed and customer service keep dribbling rubbish.</p>
<p>I'll be taking it further.</p>
