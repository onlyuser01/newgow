    <h1>Rising Star Casino Rising Sun Indiana Percy Jackson Lotus Casino Sweepstakes Casino Lakeside Hotel A</h1>

<p>Digitain, an established industry provider of iGaming software solutions and world-class sportsbook tech, as well as casino, API, and turnkey products, has announced an important executive shakeup with the company bringing Martin Martirosyan as Group Deputy CEO.</p>
<p>Martirosyan will play a significant role in the company’s C-level decisions and help Digitain continue to scale its operational clout under the leadership of company founder Varges Vardanyan.</p>
<p>The founder has welcomed the arrival of the new appointment, and praised Martirosyan’s proven and established leadership position in not just iGaming, but several other industries:</p>
<p>"Martin, who has held senior corporate positions with HSBC, brings that wealth of experience as our group of companies expands and we service more B2C partner operators in regulated markets."</p>
<p>Martirosyan is a seasoned business veteran who did a 15-year stint with HSBC Bank Armenia CJCS, amassing exceptional experience in managing and running large-scale corporate operations. This expertise can now be put to good use as Digitain is looking to secure further growth opportunities in the European iGaming market.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, Martirosyan was similarly pleased to be part of the company and be tasked with some of its most important operations. He said that he was prepared to steer Digitain towards a brighter future in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and well beyond.</p>
<p>"The business is an example of a great organization, people, culture, and technology delivery which has been recognized with multiple international and local industry and business awards," the new deputy CEO confirmed.</p>
<p>Martirosyan’s appointment is one of a number of high-level moves within the company. Earlier this year, Grigor Asoyan was appointed as Deputy CEO of Technology. Simon Westbury became CEO of Sports Generate and Iain Hutchison stepped in as Chief Revenue Officer for the company.</p>
