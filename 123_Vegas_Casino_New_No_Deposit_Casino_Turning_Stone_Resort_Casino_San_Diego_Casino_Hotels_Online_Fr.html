    <h1>123 Vegas Casino New No Deposit Casino Turning Stone Resort Casino San Diego Casino Hotels Online Fr</h1>

<p>I start playing this Malaysia online casino platform "M777" on January, I've deposit few times and I didn't make any withdrawal yet so far. I am a sportsbook player so I deposit and also did take bonus from the platform. This company platform do have a sportsbook rule which is you are only available to bet on "World Cup" "UEFA Champion" "UEFA Europa" "English Premier" "Bundesliga" "Italy Serie A" "Ligue 1" "LaLiga". At first I didn't notice the rules so I did play other match league out of the rules. Next, I lost all the money and make deposit again this time their customer service warned me about the betting T&amp;C. I followed their rules and starting betting those league I mentioned above and achieved my rollover target "x25". During midnight I tried to make my first withdrawal with them, I've waited an hour or more so I tried to contact them via WhatsApp. They told me they have to wait game report from the game provider something like that. meantime waiting I told them to cancel my withdrawal because I still want to continue my game, so they cancelled my withdrawal and return my game credit then I continue my game during that day. The next day after I wake, I try to login back into my account and found out they've locked my account and I try to contact them on WhatsApp. They start giving me excuses about system error or game provider issue and then the final they blocked my contact on WhatsApp straight.</p>
