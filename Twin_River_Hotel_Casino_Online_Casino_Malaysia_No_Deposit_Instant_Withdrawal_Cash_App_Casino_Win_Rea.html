    <h1>Twin River Hotel Casino Online Casino Malaysia No Deposit Instant Withdrawal Cash App Casino Win Rea</h1>

<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>I wanted to comment something that seems completely unfair to me, I have an account in this casino where I deposited with my ING mastercard from Spain the amount of € 474, which playing casino with that money I have acquired € 1,150, which I now want to withdraw .... this is where the problems come from, in all the withdrawals that they accept and have enabled such as bank transfer, much better, skrill, etc. They tell me that I have to withdraw that money only with the Mastercard (which is where I deposited the money) with which thing does NOT work, I have called my bank and they tell me that it is not possible to receive a credit on my card, doing it this way In any case, it is the business that has to make the refund on the card in order for me to receive the money, not in this strange way, with which in this method the bank rejects it and it is not possible for me to receive that money .</p>
<p>The other is now what do I have to do? I really can not send a bank document of ownership according to the account that I have is associated with the mastercard and be able to receive the money through a bank account? It is that I do not understand it, it seems that they do not want me or pay a money that I have earned, it is that it seems serious and unfair to me, I have played in more than 30 casinos and in none have I seen anything similar. I have even created a much better account to see if I could make the withdrawal there, and supposedly when you try it, an error appears that you contact wirwetten support, because I am very disappointed. Is it so difficult to receive the € 1,150 that I have won in the casino? They have the option of withdrawals by bank transfer and do not let me. Take action on the matter and a solution because this is important to me please</p>
