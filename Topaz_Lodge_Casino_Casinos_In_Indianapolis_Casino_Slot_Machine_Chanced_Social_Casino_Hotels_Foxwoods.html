    <h1>Topaz Lodge Casino Casinos In Indianapolis Casino Slot Machine Chanced Social Casino Hotels Foxwoods</h1>

<p>Dear Winstoria Casino Team,</p>
<p>Although the final decision was already made, I would like to explain it from our point of view.</p>
<p>You claim you are more than sure the client did it intentionally to bypass the blocking, but, it is hard to prove it. Therefore, I asked you for additional data above. Moreover, the player filled in his real name, surname and date of birth in the registration form. If this was correctly enforced by the system, as you stated, it would not be enforced based on personal data which can be changed from time to time, especially in the case a long time elapsed between the registrations in different casinos. The casino found out that the player is self-excluded in the sister casino only based on his information provided to the customer support. We do not know whether he knew this really earlier than he lost his money. But, we know he has a gambling problem.</p>
<p>In case you would like to refer to your rule about sister casinos - there is no information anywhere that Winstoria Casino is the sister casino of Stelario Casino. Then it does not make any sense to refer to this rule and/or to turn to the regulator.</p>
<p>A more important factor led us to the final decision - the fact the player informed you that he has closed accounts in another casino due to a gambling problem, and the fact that he would have to have a separately closed account due to a gambling problem at Winstoria Casino if he wanted to refer to the rule about self-exclusion.</p>
<p>The point is the player has a gambling problem and he informed the casino about it. He had lost his money and tried to use the rule about self-exclusion and tried to request his deposit to be refunded. I think I do not have to explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no reason to refer to any other complaints here. Every case is somehow specific and I do not know what were the results of the investigation and the circumstances of any other complaint and why it was decided in that way.</p>
<p>Conclusion - The player registered at Winstoria Casino and lost his funds. The casino acted correctly and within its Responsible Gaming policy rules when closed the player's account due to a gambling problem.</p>
<p>Dear Purnojahakka,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information, it was decided the complaint will be rejected. Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by.</p>
<p>Thank you, Winstoria Casino Team, for your replies and for providing information.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
