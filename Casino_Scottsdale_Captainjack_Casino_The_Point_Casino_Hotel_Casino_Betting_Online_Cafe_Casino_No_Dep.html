<p>Richard “Dick” Duchossois, an Illinois businessman who headed a group that bought Arlington Park nearly 40 years ago and then oversaw the suburban Chicago track’s resurrection from a devastating fire, died Friday. He was 100.</p>

<p>After serving as an Army officer in World War II, where he won a Purple Heart and two Bronze Stars, Duchossois entered the business world and became chief executive of a railroad car manufacturing company in the 1950s.</p>
<p>By 1983, he had become chairman of Duchossois Industries, and that year, the company bought Arlington Park.</p>
<p>“Mr. D. accomplished many good things in life,” a statement posted on Arlington Park’s Twitter feed stated. “He worked hard and always followed the path of honesty and integrity, which is a gift that he passed on to all of us around him. We are most grateful to him for sharing this gift with us.”</p>
<p>Made the Million a Priority After Fire</p>
<p>The track was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1985. While Arlington officials moved the track’s summer meet to nearby Hawthorne Race Course, Duchossois made sure that the Arlington Million – the track’s signature race – remained at the course.</p>
<p>Less than a month after the fire, Duchossois had temporary stands erected at the Arlington Heights track, and a crowd of 35,000 watched as Teleprompter won the 1-1/4-mile turf race.</p>
<p>An obituary in the Arlington Heights Daily Herald recalled an interview Duchossois gave in 2015. He said that his first reaction to the July 1985 blaze was to find a way to rebuild the track as quickly as possible. His next thought was to find a way to keep the Million at the track.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a little bit of stupidity on my part to think we could do this, but it never dawned on me that we couldn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>The track itself would not reopen until 1989. However, when it did, it stood as a crown jewel of racing, with a six-story grandstand. It hosted the Breeders’ Cup in 2002.</p>
<p>But Arlington would face other challenges less than a decade later. In 1998 and 1999, the track went dark after Duchossois said it was losing millions and faced numerous challenges, including competition from casino gaming.</p>
<p>Casino gaming would be an issue over the years with the track.</p>
<p>Arlington would resume racing in 2000, the same year Churchill Downs Inc. purchased the track.</p>
<p>Served on Churchill Downs Board</p>
<p>Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen issued a statement Friday calling Duchossois a “mentor and a friend” to many at the Louisville-based company. Churchill Downs acquired the Arlington Heights track from Duchossois in 2000. Duchossois then served as a board member at Churchill Downs until his retirement in 2019.</p>
<p>Duchossois was a director emeritus at Churchill Downs Inc.</p>
<p>“He was a tireless champion of Churchill Downs and thoroughbred racing,” Carstanjen said. “His impact on those of us involved in this industry was simply immeasurable.”</p>
<p>Churchill Downs closed Arlington after last year’s meet and announced it would sell the 326-acre property to the Chicago Bears. That sale for $197 million is expected to close either late this year or early in 2023.</p>
<p>Prior to the sale, Churchill officials and Illinois horsemen went through protracted negotiations over purses in recent years.</p>
<p>Horsemen were upset that Churchill would not pursue casino gaming at the track after Illinois lawmakers approved expanded gaming in the state in 2019. Churchill Downs also owns a majority stake in nearby Rivers Casino Des Plaines.</p>
<p>In a March 2021 interview with the Daily Herald, Duchossois said he didn’t understand the sale, but supported it.</p>
