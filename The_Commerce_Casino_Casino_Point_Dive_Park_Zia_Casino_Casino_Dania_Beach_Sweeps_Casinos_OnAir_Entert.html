    <h1>The Commerce Casino Casino Point Dive Park Zia Casino Casino Dania Beach Sweeps Casinos OnAir Entert</h1>

<p>The provider of innovative live casino gaming content and one of the newest developers in the sector has a new product to offer</p>
<p>Nexus Roulette is a game that is built with the player in mind and offers exciting showmanship and core gameplay inspired by the classic version of the game. OnAir Entertainment has gone the extra mile to build a studio environment that the company describes as “futuristic” and that is optimized to guarantee an immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p>Nexus Roulette Becomes Latest OnAir Entertainment Addition</p>
<p>The gaming experience takes action across four roulette wheels which have the opportunity to land a solid payout of 5,000. To help consumers feel more involved, the games come with real-time percentages of user bets, giving players the opportunity to keep a close eye on the action.</p>
<p>As is OnAir Entertainment’s custom, partner operators will be able to ask for specific digital branding to promote brand awareness. The game can be further customized to meet specific needs. Nexus Roulette is hailed as a fresh touch to the live casino vertical, the company says.</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment director of business development Seval Kaya has welcomed the opportunity to introduce yet another excellent game that stands out and meets market needs in full. She added:</p>
<p>Since its first sketches generated great expectations and today with Nexus Roulette live, those expectations have even been exceeded. The efforts of all the teams behind this creation have been outstanding. OnAir Entertainment director of business development Seval Kaya</p>
<p>OnAir Entertainment has been moving fast as the company has set up several prominent partnerships and reached business milestones over the past weeks. Just this week, the company managed to open a brand new live studio in Romania, which features Eclipse Blackjack, Standard Roulette, and Standard Blackjack, with more games coming.</p>
<p>At the end of January, OnAir Entertainment similarly introduced a new title, Blazing Dragon, an advanced card game for players to enjoy in a live setting as they see fit. OnAir Entertainment has been growing its footprint and list of partners at a good pace, with the company recently teaming up with LeoVegas to provide the operator with its selection of live casino games.</p>
