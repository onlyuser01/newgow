    <h1>Casino Washington Seattle Casino Laughlin Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Twin Arrow Casino Morongo Casi</h1>

<p>Ocean Casino Resorts in Atlantic City is confident that it has a lot more to offer back to consumers who visit its premises for a recreational bet on sports or games of chance. Now, the facility is planning to invest $5 million to refurbish its bar and merge it with sports betting and gambling facilities.</p>
<p>New Sportsbook Experience for Ocean Visitors</p>
<p>The Gallery Bar, Book &amp; Games will sprawl on 12,000 sq ft where the existing sportsbook is now up and running. The funding is part of the $25-million funding plan for the overall casino floor at Ocean Casino and the company has rightly found it appropriate to spend more on the sports betting experience. In a statement, casino general manager Bill Callahan teased some of the changes and expectations from the property:</p>
<p>“Ocean is dedicated to being the premier gaming destination in the Atlantic City market. This new venue will enhance the guest experience by providing an unbeatable atmosphere right in the heart of the casino floor.” Ocean Casino general manager Bill Callahan</p>
<p>The new bar will truly try to offer an all-in-one package that will see 12 slot machines, blackjack, and tables available along with video screen walls to offer sports bettors a constant view of whatever sports action it is they are after. The facility will be connected to a series of other facilities as well, offering a comprehensive experience.</p>
<p>The sports betting services at the bar have been pre-agreed with USBookmaking, a leading supplier of betting markets in the United States. Ocean Casino has also recently undergone an ownership restructuring.</p>
<p>Changes in Ownership and Following Renovation Plans</p>
<p>Now, 50% of the property is owned by Ilitch Holdings operating out of Detroit. The company owns the Little Caesars chain along with MLB’s Detroit Tigers and not least, NHL’s Red Wings. Ilitch has well-documented ownership in casino properties, including the MotorCity Casino Hotel in Detroit. In fact, this is the company’s first casino investment to spread beyond its stomping ground in Detroit.</p>
<p>Ocean Casino is currently pushing ahead with finalizing its investment plan which includes new VIP facilities, the already discussed sportsbook, and improved rooms and suites. Some of this must-have rubbed off on its overall public perception because the casino is now ranking third in terms of gross gaming revenue out of all Atlantic City casinos and casino resorts for 2021.</p>
<p>Gross operating profit though was subdued and based on that criterion, Ocean only came in fifth, which still demonstrated the company’s ability to stay competitive. The refurbishment should help add new customers, although a proposal to ban smoking from gaming floors is feared to chase away customers to neighboring states exactly.</p>
