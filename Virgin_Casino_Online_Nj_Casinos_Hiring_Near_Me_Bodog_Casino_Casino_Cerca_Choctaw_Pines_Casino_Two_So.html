<p>Soft2Bet has acquired licenses for two of its brands, YoyoCasino and Campobet, from the Malta Gaming Association (MGA), strengthening its position on the European market.</p>
<p>Campobet and Yoyocasino Receive MGA Licenses</p>
<p>Soft2Bet’s brands Campobet and YoyoCasino have received licenses from the Malta Gaming Association (MGA) and have been considered the “best performing brands in Europe.” Soft2Bet has strengthened its position in the European gaming sector, offering a wide range of sports wagering options and casino games, which are an essential part of its ‘all-in-one entertainment experience.’ YoyoCasino, made to meet the specific needs of operators, includes several popular games like Starburst, Bonanza Megaways, and Divine Fortune Megaways.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with GamblingNews in March, Soft2Bet PR Director Hamza Afifi said that the company’s strategy remains the same, but its execution changed. The company has now shifted online to continue spread the Soft2Bet message.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet Strengthens Its Presence in Europe</p>
<p>With its new licenses, Soft2Bet can boost its presence in Europe to reach new international clients. CEO of Soft2Bet, Boris Chaikin, said, “We are delighted that YoyoCasino and Campobet have been launched under the MGA license.”</p>
<p>He added that this would allow the company to operate in different markets, which is a milestone for Soft2Bet, and take it to the next level. Chaikin stated that the company’s portfolio is growing, including cutting-edge casino and sportsbook products tailored for a wide range of audiences. Sof2Bet is ready to expand on a global scale.</p>
<p>In an interview with SBC, Soft2Bet’s Head of VIP, Ivan Lorinkov, commented on problem gambling and stated that it should be a recreational activity for fun and entertainment. He said that utilizing real-time data is ‘a promising way’ to fight gambling addiction. In January, the company signed a deal with Latrobet, a software developer, aiming to enhance its horse and greyhound race offering.</p>
<p>Before launching its brands in Malta, Soft2Bet strengthened its presence in Scandinavia, appointing Peter Christian Noer as Regional Manager for the Nordic markets, who was previously a Country Manager for Sweden.</p>
<p>Malta A Major Gambling Hub with Reputation Trouble</p>
<p>Malta is one of the world’s most renowned gambling hubs. It’s a base for more than 250 betting operators like Tipico, Betsson, William Hill, and others. Its online gambling makes up 12% of the country’s GDP, providing jobs to 9,000 people and generating around $836 million. In January, MGA appointed former chief legal officer Carl Brincat as CEO. He replaced the former CEO Farrugia, who resigned last year. Brincat’s extensive experience and leadership skills will help MGA continue its mission to cooperate with EU regulators to enforce new measures to protect sports integrity.</p>
<p>That will be a challenging task, given the fact that Malta just became the first European Union country to be added to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list. The FATF reached its decision this week, and Brincat will need to work overtime to convince the organization that Malta is diligently working to clean up its act.</p>
