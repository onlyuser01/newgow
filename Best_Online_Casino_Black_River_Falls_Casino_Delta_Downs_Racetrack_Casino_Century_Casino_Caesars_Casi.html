<p>DC United vs. FC Cincinnati is arguably the most interesting soccer duel of the weekend in the whole wide world</p>
<p>DC United is a team that’s great on the break and from set-pieces. This makes Wayne Rooney’s boys incredibly dangerous for teams like FC Cincinnati that love to keep the ball in their possession. Which soccer strategy will prevail on June 24?</p>
<p>If you take a look at MLS odds, you’ll see that bookies see the home team as the favorite. That’s kind of surprising given that FC Cincinnati is the team with the most points collected so far in the 2023 MLS.</p>

<p>Ahead of the 21st gameweek of the 2023 MLS season, DC United has 23 points. Wayne Rooney’s team has a record of 6-5-8 and a score differential of 26-26. These guys are doing okay in the attack, but their defense has been abysmal in 2023.</p>
<p>The reason for this lies in the style of soccer the boys from the capital play. They like to let the opposition have the ball. Instead of carefully building up each attack, they like to blitz their way toward the opponent’s goal.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise because DC United has some really pacey forwards on the roster, most notably, Taxiarchis Fountas and Cristian Dajome. These guys play on the side while towering Belgian target man Christian Benteke is anchored in the center.</p>
<p>This sort of strategy has worked for them in some games this season. Actually, in five of the six games they’ve won this season, they were the team with the lower ball possession percentage. It’s almost certain the same will be the case in Gameweek 21 this Saturday, but will they be able to hit Cincy on the break?</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati Players Don’t Want Their Superb Run to End</p>
<p>Cincy’s players have been phenomenal this season, both offensively and defensively. FC Cincinnati is one of the highest-scoring teams in the league, as well as one with the best defense. They’re 13-4-1 this season with a score difference of 30-16. The secret to this team’s success in 2023 is that all of its players work very hard all over the pitch.</p>
<p>These guys love to have the ball in their possession, but they rarely waste time. Instead, if there’s a chance to score, they’ll go for it. That’s why Cincy’s games are never boring.</p>
<p>The main reason why MLS odds are going against Cincy is that coach Pat Noonan won’t be able to count on several first-team players on June 24. American defenders Matt Miazga and Nick Hagglund are injured, and the same goes for Brazilian forwards Brenner and Sergio Santos.</p>
<p>The good news is that Colombian central defender Yerson Mosquera is coming back after missing one game due to a yellow card suspension. This is great news for FC Cincinnati as the 22-year-old, who’s on loan from Wolves, is great in the air, meaning that not only can defend crosses but he can also cause problems in DC United’s 18-yard box.</p>
<p>DC United vs. FC Cincinnati Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that this is going to be a very fun game, with plenty of goals. We think it’s very likely each of these will score some goals. But which team will score more? We think neither. Instead, a high-scoring draw looks like the most probable outcome of Saturday’s game.</p>
<p>Pick: DC United and FC Cincinnati to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
