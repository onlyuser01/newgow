    <h1>Big Dollar Casino Maine Casinos Railroad Pass Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Hotel Niagara Falls Ny</h1>

<p>On his way out of Rivers Casino De Plaines in Illinois, a patron was accosted by two unidentified perpetrators and robbed at gunpoint earlier this week. 34-year-old Cordero Supe lost $40,000 and several valuables, including his phone and watch, in the attack, the victim alleges, as the police investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Victim Approached by a Four-Door Sedan</p>
<p>He left the casino at 2:25 am on November 8 when two masked men approached him and pointed guns at him, getting off the four-door sedan they drove next to him moments before the attack. According to Supe, the man demanded that he give in his money, which he did, complying with their request.</p>
<p>After handing them over the money, the men drove away. Supe, who is originally from Chicago, said that he was on a visit to the city, and was a frequent player at Rivers. In his statement to media outlets, Supe sounded disappointing, arguing that he had expected the casino to protect him.</p>
<p>“I am a black card member who spends hundreds of thousands of dollars up here,” Supe added. Security did not come to the parking lot after he called them immediately following the attack he continued.</p>
<p>Did Security Respond on Time</p>
<p>According to Supe he had to walk back in and alert security in person. Meanwhile, the Rivers casino has issued a statement that partly contradicted the allegations he made:</p>
<p>“We appreciate the rapid response of our first responders, and we immediately provided the property’s robust surveillance footage to law enforcement agencies to assist in their investigation. The safety and security of guests and team members is Rivers’ top priority.”</p>
<p>Rivers has confirmed that it has increased its security protocols to reinforce the parking lot, with measures already in place to guarantee the safety of all guests including outside of the casino.</p>
<p>Supe, though, managed to snap a shot of the perpetrators’ car as they were speeding away from the scene of the crime. He had a second mobile on his person to make the photo. Casinos have often been associated with crime, as their parking lots can be dangerous places for high-value customers.</p>
<p>Last month, the Golden Nugget in Biloxi became the scene of a violent crime with one patron apparently shooting another person. The discharge of the arm happened outside of the casino in the parking lot.</p>
