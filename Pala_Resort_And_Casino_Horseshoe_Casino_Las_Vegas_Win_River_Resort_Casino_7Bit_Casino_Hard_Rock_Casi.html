<p>Online slot developer, Stakelogic, has recently expanded its international footprint. On the heels of several collaborative efforts this month, the iGaming developer adds Italy’s StarCasinò as its latest conquest.</p>

<p>Stakelogic has been gaining steam recently. Prior to the new partnership with Betsson, it teams up with Mr. Gamble and Reflex Gaming. Those collaborations followed new deals with BetVictor and Parimatch in November.</p>
<p>Live iGaming casinos continue to gain traction, and Stakelogic has embraced the segment as well. It has its own live casino arm, Stakelogic Live, which produces in-house content to be streamed from its own studio in Malta. Recently, the segment witnessed a growth spurt, which saw it looking for around 100 game presenters. The Live platform targets baccarat, blackjack, roulette and even game shows.</p>
<p>StarCasinò is Betsson’s iGaming arm in Italy. In addition to online slot machines, the popular online platform includes roulette, blackjack, poker, and other gaming options.</p>
<p>Italy’s iGaming Market Sees Mixed Results</p>
<p>The Italian iGaming market has seen its ups and downs recently. In September, sports betting revenue in Italy soared, while overall online gross gambling revenue (GGR) continued to grow after a slowdown in the retail market.</p>
<p>Online GGR was €276.8 million (US$313 million). This was a continuation of its month-on-month growth. This figure includes 50.47%, or €139.7 million (US$158 million), which was attributable to slot and casino game revenue. The share of sports betting has increased to 43.14% from 35.12% in the previous month.</p>
<p>Gaming revenue then fell 1.2% in October. The iGaming market was strong. However, sports betting dipped in the month. October’s online revenue was €243.9 million (US$275.87 million). This is slightly less than October 2020, and is still a decrease of 11.9% compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Online casinos accounted for €148.8 million (US$168.3 million) of this total, making it the strongest month since May. PokerStars Casino remained the market leader in this vertical, although its market share decreased marginally to 9.2% from September.</p>
<p>What’s Next for Italy’s iGaming</p>
<p>The upcoming year is expected to be a better year, but there are more changes to come. Like almost everywhere, Italy is updating its gambling laws.</p>
<p>Next year could see the introduction of several changes, although operators are optimistic that the outcome will be a better, more transparent industry.</p>
