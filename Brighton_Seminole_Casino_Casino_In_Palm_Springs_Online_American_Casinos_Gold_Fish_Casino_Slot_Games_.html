<p>The leading lottery app in the United States, Jackpocket, confirmed that it continues to expand its presence in the country. Earlier this week, the app announced its entry into the market in Nebraska, delivering a new way for customers in the state to experience their favorite lottery games.</p>
<p>Famous as a lottery courier service, Jackpocket purchases lottery tickets on behalf of its customers via official lottery retailers. The company offers a secure platform where users view an image of their ticket and also place ticket orders.</p>
<p>To ensure maximum convenience, Jackpocket provides an automatic notification if the customers have a winning ticket. Prizes up to $500 can be secured instantly, while lucky players with higher prizes are notified and their winning ticket is transferred to them in a secure way so that they can claim their prize from the respective lottery.</p>
<p>Peter Sullivan, Jackpocket's founder and CEO, shared his excitement in a statement. He pointed out: "The Jackpocket team is excited to offer Nebraskans—long-time lottery players and new players alike—an easy and accessible way to play." Finally, Sullivan said: "We're committed to making the lottery safe, convenient, and fun. With 29 lottery millionaires and counting on Jackpocket, we're looking forward to meeting our first big winner in the Cornhusker State!"</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent launch, lottery players in Nebraska can use Jackpocket's app to engage in games such as Mega Millions, Lucky for Life, Pick 3, Pick 5, as well as Powerball. Ensuring maximum convenience, Jackpocket can be accessed via computers, tablets or mobile phones.</p>
<p>Celebrating its launch in Nebraska, Jackpocket unveiled details regarding an exciting promotion. Customers in the state, who are at least 19 years old, would be able to receive their first lottery ticket for free via the app. New customers that enter a special code NEBRASKA when checking out of their first order will be able to receive a $2 lottery ticket.</p>
<p>While providing a supreme form of entertainment, Jackpocket remains committed to responsible gaming and customer protection. The app offers responsible gambling options such as self-exclusion, daily spending and deposit limits, as well as other resources. A testament to the app's commitment to responsible gaming is its responsible gaming certification awarded by the National Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<p>The launch in Nebraska marks the latest state where Jackpocket's services are available. It follows launches completed in other important markets around the US such as New Jersey, New York, Colorado, Minnesota, Washington DC, Ohio and New Mexico, among others.</p>
