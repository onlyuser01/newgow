<p>Vladimir Malakchi, Evoplay’s chief commercial officer, said that his company’s LATAM operations have been very successful so far</p>
<p>Evoplay, a provider of iGaming titles, has unveiled a new LATAM-oriented partnership with Sportingtech, a leading online and retail gaming platform provider. The deal is expected to “greatly boost” the former company’s presence in the region.</p>
<p>As agreed, Evoplay will integrate its top-performing LATAM titles into Sportingtech’s vast portfolio of casino content. The latter company boasts a library of over 10,000 casino games from industry-leading providers.</p>
<p>As a result, Sportingtech’s operator partners will be able to access Evoplay’s cutting-edge content. Thanks to its popularity in Latin America, the studio will channel more players toward the platforms of Sportingtech’s partners. This will improve the operators’ customer engagement and profitability while allowing Evoplay to expand its footprint.</p>
<p>Evoplay is very successful in LATAM thanks to its sports-themed instant games, including hits such as Penalty Shoot-hot and its Hot Rio Nights slot. The agreement with Sportingtech is the latest in a string of agreements that have seen the provider ally itself with many notable companies.</p>
<p>CCO Malakchi Praised the Deal</p>
<p>Vladimir Malakchi, Evoplay’s chief commercial officer, said that his company’s LATAM operations have been very successful. He noted that over the past year, the company’s bet totals skyrocketed by 560%. Malakchi said that the region remains a top priority for the company which is still looking to further expand its customer base and audience reach.</p>
<p>Malakchi added that he is very happy about the opportunity to join forces with Sportingtech, which he lauded as a global powerhouse.</p>
<p>We’re very proud to be partnering with Sportingtech, one of the most recognized platform brands not only in LatAm, but globally, and with our innovative titles being hugely popular, we’re sure to continue growing even more rapidly now with Sportingtech. Vladimir Malakchi, CCO, Evoplay</p>
