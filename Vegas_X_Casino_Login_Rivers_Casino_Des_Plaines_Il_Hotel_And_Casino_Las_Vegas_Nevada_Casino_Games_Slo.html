    <h1>Vegas X Casino Login Rivers Casino Des Plaines Il Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nevada Casino Games Slo</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Rabona decided to close my account today. Why ? Because they didn't want to send me the money i earned fair and square. Honestly, i'm 35yo and in my whole life i've never seen a scam like this. They have an international license but they act like thiefs in the street. Anyway, let me explain first :</p>
<p>I asked for two withdrawals as you can see in the screen ( 500€ then 496€ ), it was probably "too much for them" so they decided to ask me for some documents. Identity proof, debit card proof, address proof, i sent immediatly everything and they were all approved. Then, the asked an additional document, my bank transactions from the card i used to top up my revolut account ! I sent them that PDF immediatly as well, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that file as all my transactions are daily life expenses, bills, rent, and many deposits to revolut. Still, it seems that they decided to close my account, certainly just 'cause they refuse to pay the money i earned as everything was 100% clean.</p>
<p>Should i call a lawyer now ? Let me know please what should i do, 'cause what i hate the most is the injustice, so i will never let Rabona act like thiefs and get away with that.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Luca</p>
<p>( I also took some screenshots of every step 'cause i somehow understood that they were preparing a scam, so here's a proof that everything was approved just in case they dare to lie and say that it wasn't )</p>
