    <h1>New Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Hollywood Casino Ampitheater Durango Casino And Resort News Casin</h1>

<p>FUN88, a sports betting operator which focuses on Asian markets, has announced that it’s adding Spanish captain Ilker Casillas as its new brand ambassador ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, which will be held from November 20 through December 18. The company sees this as an important milestone which will help the company achieve better brand recognition and appeal to fans of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>Fun88 Brings Ilker Casillas to Appeal to Soccer Fans</p>
<p>The operator is confident that it will be able to build on a long-term partnership, which will offer various opportunities for collaboration. For the immediate future, FUN88 plans to leverage Casillas’ imagery and likeness with various fan activations, social media campaigns, and advertisement opportunities.</p>
<p>Casillas’ appeal is definitely there, as he is one of the best goalkeepers of all time and his prominence in the world of soccer does add legitimacy to FUN88’s offer. As for the man himself, Casillas has played in numerous prominent teams throughout his career, including Newcastle United FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, and many others. His decision to help FUN88 will undoubtedly help the brand grow its global presence and expand at a time when the world is fixated on one of the biggest sports events of all time.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, a FUN88 spokesperson offered nothing but praise for the new addition. Casillas is a natural entertainer, the company said in a laudatory press release. His performances as an outstanding goalkeeper have been seared into the minds of entire generations, and his performance has carried on and has been passed down as a soccer myth. The spokesperson added:</p>
<p>FUN88 intends to harness this breakout partnership to drive awareness and participation around our progressive brand values across both mature and developing Asian territories. FUN88 spokesperson</p>
<p>Casillas Is a Legend and Happy to Work with FUN88</p>
<p>Casillas himself was excited to be joining the operator for the upcoming event and said that the brand aligned well with his own history in the sport and his own passion for soccer to this day:</p>
<p>As a result, I look forward to bringing some top-class content and activity to Asian markets with my signature style and professionalism, allowing fans to find new and deeper ways in which to engage with and enjoy the sports they love. Ilker Casillas</p>
<p>Fun88 is rapidly expanding its reach in various verticals of the gaming and betting experience. The company is equally interested in building its esports proposition as much as it is expanding in casino and sports betting. FUN88 has been growing its footprint through the recent rollout of a casino in Vietnam.</p>
