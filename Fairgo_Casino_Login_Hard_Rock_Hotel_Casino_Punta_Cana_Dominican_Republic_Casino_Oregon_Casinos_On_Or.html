    <h1>Fairgo Casino Login Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Dominican Republic Casino Oregon Casinos On Or</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I got a reload bonus of 300% to 400 € (Betvili sent this to the entire customer base) and played it.</p>
<p>As a streamer, I played this bonus online on Twitch and currently had 600 viewers.</p>
<p>I had 2 strong wins and was over € 8000 (the wager was at € 20,600)</p>
<p>A day later I wanted to quit the wager and logged into my account. Over the night, the wager went from € 20,600 to € 2060.</p>
<p>We only played Legacy of Dead in that session and did a grind. This game fulfills the bonus conditions 100% and we did not exceed the max bet of € 5.</p>
<p>So I didn't touch the money anymore after the problem arose and wrote to the affiliate manager via Skype. I was able to do that because I had also advertised this site in the past.</p>
<p>It's been 3 months now and I'm waiting for € 2250. The max cashout was on this bonus € 3000 and we would have achieved this without any problems if the wager had not reset itself.</p>
<p>The casino as well as the manager confirm to us that there was a mistake in the system and that we did not do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Every day we were put off and told, "We'll get in touch tomorrow". As I said, this has been going on since May. I then put some pressure on, because it's just a lot of money and asked every day what happened to it several days / weeks then ignored. The affiliate manager Michael was then supposedly able to clarify something with his superior Tati and confirmed the payment amount of 3000 € to us.</p>
<p>On the positive side, we received a small deposit of € 750 after 2 months and the remaining amount should have come as well, which was not the case. Then yesterday a new update and a call from Michael his account (but it wasn't Michael) but another person who works there. This was called Georg.</p>
<p>He said he had to yell at me and wanted to suggest that if I bring him 6 new players (thus resuming the promotion of Betvili) he would pay me 1000 € and if I bring another 6 players, another 1000 € would get. Which I refused because this bonus had nothing to do with a promotion and we haven't been promoting Betvili since March.</p>
<p>I then told him whether he would be satisfied if he paid in € 250 and was entitled to € 3000 and then I would only give him € 750. Of course not...</p>
<p>I took a screenshot or many screenshots of the entire Betvili site right after it started and it became dubious.</p>
<p>All terms and conditions were screenshoted, we still have the remaining balance of 4700 € on the account and I have about 600 people who can confirm what happened there. Some players wrote to me a day later after the stream and said they had the same problem and the wager also reset itself for these people.</p>
<p>I got an email from Michael and Tati saying that we will receive the payment. I also made a video if he got the idea to delete the chat history on Skype, which confirms what has been written.</p>
<p>Now this Georg writes to me a few minutes ago that I should be satisfied with another 450 €, which I won't do, because if I play a bonus and I manage it and have a maxcashout of 3000 €, then of course I want to have this money . Georg said that I am not a good businessman and wanted to keep making dubious offers and literally yelled at me on the phone and only interrupted me with everything I said to him and was very, very unfriendly. Michael has tried everything that we get our money, but he said that his boss is blocking everything.</p>
<p>Even internal things, that the affiliate accounts have been set to 0, I just noticed. At that time I also had more than 250 € open to commissions from the promoter at the time. I like to forego the € 250 because I will never advertise this casino again after what has happened now. My affiliate account had money on it from Revenue Share, a few days later it was 0 and they just set the numbers from the players to 0 (but that's not the issue). They offer bonuses and if you manage to do them, they can't or won't pay out and then argue with totally nonsensical arguments.</p>
<p>I myself work partially with a network and know all streamers (whether German or English) who live here in Malta and am very well off with a lot of people.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me. Many Thanks.</p>
