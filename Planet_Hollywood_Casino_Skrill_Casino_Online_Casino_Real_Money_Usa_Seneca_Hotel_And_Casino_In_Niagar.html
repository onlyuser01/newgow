<p>North Guardians review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>North Guardians is themed around a Nordic fantasy world.</p>
<p>Players will brave a bitterly cold Scandinavia winter to embark on an epic quest. With fur-clad warriors by their side, they will seek mythical treasures.</p>
<p>This slot is a great choice for those looking for a magical escape, as well as fans of the popular show Vikings.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack blends ethereal music with the ambient sound of gusting wind. This helps establish the desolate, snowy setting, immersing the players in the northern world.</p>
<p>On the reels, players will meet a stern bearded viking, as well as a warrior with pink hair and blue face paint that brings to mind a punk rock musician. A stoic old man resembling Thor makes an appearance as well, wearing a golden crown.</p>
<p>A variety of runes can also be found among the symbols, each one crafted from a precious gem. This adds a splash of color to the reels, along with an air of mystery.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, there is a snowy landscape decorated with haunting stone figures. Players will find themselves curious about the secrets of this enchanted realm.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create an entertaining world of viking fantasy.</p>

<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spins symbol.</p>
<p>During the base game, two halves of a rectangle take the form of an underlay on the screen. During each spin, the pieces appear in random positions, merging into one full rectangle if they land on the same position.</p>
<p>A wheel showing Wild patterns is displayed after each spin with 5 levels shown. This wheel spins, stopping either on a slice or a Level Up. If the wheel stops on a pattern, Wild symbols are added, corresponding to the shape and number of Wilds in the pattern. These Wilds are added to randomly selected positions.</p>
<p>When players land at least 3 Free Spins symbols, the Free Spins feature begins with 5 free spins. Throughout the Free Spins feature, the wheel spins and stops at every free spin. The wheel begins at Level 1, and any Level Up that occurs during the free spins feature increases the level until the end of the round, up to Level 5. Additional free spins are also awarded for Level Ups.</p>
<p>The maximum win during the Free Spins feature is 5,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
