<p>Playson is taking another step into the regulated gambling market in Switzerland with the company securing a content partnership that will cover one of the country’s best-established operators.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Playson will deploy its portfolio of trusted and player-favorite games with Grand Casino Baden, a local household name and land-based giant which is making strong forays into digital space.</p>
<p>Playson Sales Director Blanka Homor welcomed the opportunity and said that Grand Casino Baden is clearly a very important partner in the local market, allowing the studio to secure even more important positions with players. It’s not the last partnership that Playson and Homor’s team have in mind for the Swiss market either:</p>
<p>"The deal not only allows us to grow in a key market but also offer our popular titles to more players across the country. We hope to continue growing in Switzerland and reach more significant deals with local operators."</p>
<p>Grand Casino Baden is operating in Switzerland with Jackpots.ch which will now have a host of Playson’s promising and experience-focused games, including Lions Gems: Hold and Win, Wolf Power Megaways, and Diamond Fortunator Hold and Win.</p>
<p>Both Playson and Grand Casino Baden are happy with the new partnership as it allows them to push further with audiences in the country and secure further market reach.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Baden Chief Online Gaming Brian Christner was happy to have Playson join the casino and bring its "much-loved titles." This is definitely great news for the company’s players, he added.</p>
<p>Christner didn’t miss sharing his company’s importance in the local iGaming market and stressed that partnering with prominent iGaming suppliers is the only way to remain competitive and cater to players’ ever-evolving tastes and preferences.</p>
<p>Grand Casino Baden may have been working to actively expand its reach in the online gaming market, but in doing so, it has not neglected its land-based experience either. In October, the company partnered with Zitro for the delivery of the advanced Altius Glare cabinet, improving the experience at the brick-and-mortar property as well.</p>
<p>In December, Playson joined SkillOnNet’s library of games, marking the company’s prominent status in the iGaming industry.</p>
