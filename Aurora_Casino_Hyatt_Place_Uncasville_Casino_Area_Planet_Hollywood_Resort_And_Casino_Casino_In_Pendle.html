<p>The survey was needed to help the league better understand young bettors and how betting affects student-athletes</p>
<p>A survey commissioned by the NCAA showed that the majority of 18 to 22-year-olds bet on sports. This includes many young people on college campuses.</p>
<p>The survey, which probed into sports wagering tendencies, was conducted online by Opinion Diagnostics, a Boston-based polling company. The firm talked with a total of 3,527 people, half of which were college students with the other half being young adults not in college.</p>
<p>After talking with the respondents, Opinion Diagnostics came to certain conclusions. As it turns out, around 58% of the respondents had wagered at least once. In addition, 67% of the college students living on campus said that they are active bettors and wager on sports regularly.</p>
<p>Other curious data about college students showed that 41% of them have placed a bet on their schools’ teams. Furthermore, 35% said that they have used a student bookmaker.</p>
<p>Opinion Diagnostics learned that 30% of all respondents would usually wager around $10-20. However, 6% said that they have lost more than $500 to betting in a day.</p>
<p>Many respondents (28%) said they would bet on their mobile phones. The majority of punters playing online or in-person said that they enjoy live in-game betting the most.</p>
<p>The NCAA Wants to Understand How Young Bettors Think</p>
<p>Charlie Baker, NCAA’s president, commented on the survey, saying that it was needed to help the league better understand young bettors.</p>
<p>We needed a new baseline so we can better understand what student-athletes are experiencing on their campuses and among their peers so we can best help them deal with the potentially disruptive dynamic of legal sports betting. Charlie Baker, president, NCAA</p>
<p>The president added that sports betting is increasingly popular in the USA, which is why it attracts many young customers. However, Baker emphasized the need for a better understanding of how sports betting affects young people and even young athletes.</p>
<p>Because of that, the NCAA plans to also commission a survey that probes into athletes’ betting tendencies. The association plans to conduct it this autumn. The organization has been conducting this survey every four years since 2003.</p>
<p>Understanding how betting affects young people and student-athletes is paramount to establishing a sustainable market. Many regulated markets believe that young adults are very vulnerable to gambling harm and therefore seek to protect such customers from constant promotions.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission, for example, plans to further research this field and seek links between gateway products for young people and gambling harm.</p>
