<p>The leading casino resorts developer, Mohegan Gaming &amp; Entertainment, announced a new collaboration with the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). The announcement came Wednesday and sees Mohegan become a member of the Association.</p>
<p>Mohegan Teams up with IBIA</p>
<p>The IBIA is tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the global betting industry. A growing roster of regulated sports betting operators and organizations support the Association. Annually, the IBIA’s members account for nearly 50% of the regulated gambling industry in the world. This translates to a staggering sum surpassing $137 billion in global betting handle every year.</p>
<p>Joining forces with IBIA, leading operators seek to protect the integrity of their services and eliminate corruption. This, according to the Association is achieved via collective action. A comprehensive monitoring and alert network helps raise reports for suspicious activity within different markets.</p>
<p>Besides operators, the IBIA collaborates with gambling regulators and sports organizations, enabling them to prosecute corruption by providing vital data. This allows regulators around the globe as well as sports organizations react accordingly when it comes to suspicious bets or signs of corruption. At the same time, the process safeguards the integrity of the betting operations offered by gambling companies.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement for IBIA and Mohegan</p>
<p>According to the IBIA’s CEO, Khalid Ali, joining forces with Mohegan marks a major step in expanding the reach of the Association around the world and in North America. He outlined that IBIA is excited to team up with leading operators such as Mohegan and help protect the integrity of betting operations.</p>
<p>“The addition of Mohegan to IBIA’s ranks is an important boost for the association, maintaining our strong growth globally and particularly in North America.“ Khalid Ali, CEO of IBIA</p>
<p>Richard Roberts, Mohegan Digital’s president, added that the company is excited to become a member of the IBIA. He pointed out that this collaboration complements Mohegan’s efforts to offer leading digital entertainment services to its customers. Finally, Roberts said: “As we continue to expand our digital presence, it will be beneficial to have IBIA in our corner to ensure our members that the integrity of all games is safeguarded.”</p>
<p>“Digital gaming and sports wagering will continue to grow as cornerstones of the entertainment industry over the next few years.“ Ray Pineault, CEO and president of Mohegan</p>
<p>Mohegan’s president and CEO, Ray Pineault, predicted that the sports wagering and iGaming industry will continue to grow. He explained that becoming a member of the Association enables the company to stay at the forefront of the industry and offer its services confidently within the growing regulated gambling markets.</p>
