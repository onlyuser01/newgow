<p>UK-based sports betting giant William Hill announced yesterday it would launch its Colorado operations July 24, entering the market in partnership with Caesars Entertainment. The betting company is opening 6 kiosks in two gaming properties in Black Hawk, Isle Casino Hotel and Lady Luck Casino.</p>
<p>Colorado Sports Betting Market Highly Competitive</p>
<p>Sports betting in the Rocky Mountain State went live as planned, May 1, with the two big boys, DraftKings and FanDuel, being among the first to launch, partnering with Twin River’s Mardi Gras and Golden Gates casinos in Black Hawk, respectively. By that time William Hill was not ready to go live despite having a deal in place with Eldorado Resorts for the two casinos since 2018. Both Isle Casino Hotel and Lady Luck Casino are now property of the new gambling entity that formed after the mega-merger deal between Eldorado Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>William Hill has picked the perfect timing to go live in Colorado, coinciding with the recent return of Major League Baseball (MLB) which will soon be followed by the return of other professional sports. The seamless kiosk experience William Hill is popular with, will provide sports betting fans in the state with the opportunity to add that extra edge on their experience only a bet can provide, and will facilitate the sports book expansion into other states.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to expand our business in the state of Colorado with these new kiosks. Our relationship with Caesars Entertainment allows us to engage with Colorado sports fans in a new and exciting way. With the recent return of professional baseball, we think the timing could not be better.” David Grolman, President, Retail Operations, William Hill US</p>
<p>The sports betting kiosks will allow punters in Colorado to open up new user accounts, make cash deposits and withdrawals, but most importantly, place a bet on their favourite team to bring more adrenaline into their sports experience. In the future, William Hill is planning on offering localized futures and odds specific for the Colorado market.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to bring another amenity our valued guests can enjoy in our newly renovated Casino. Our strategic partnership with William Hill will create an elevated gaming experience that features industry-leading wagering technology and allows us to further our position as Colorado’s premiere location to gamble.” Ken Ostempowski, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Isle Casino Hotel and Lady Luck Casino</p>
<p>Besides the opened betting kiosks at the casinos, William Hill is going to expand into the state by launching mobile operations, as the sport book operator is expecting its application for a mobile sports betting license to be approved by the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission, so that the William Hill mobile app to launch in time for the start of the new professional football season.</p>
