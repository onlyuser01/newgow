    <h1>The Commerce Casino Hotel Telegraph Road Commerce Ca Casino Ohio Double Down Free Casino Chips Casin</h1>

<p>Dear djak1987,</p>
<p>I was in contact with the casino representative outside of the thread.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since you are located in Russia, and currently, there are many restrictions and sanctions applied against your country of residence, it is not possible to make a withdrawal. Although the casino tried to find a solution, it is out of its control, and it rather depends on the processes of the casino's 3rd party payment providers/processors, which are not able to process your withdrawal.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you provided the casino with your e-wallet - from which country did you create this e-wallet, and how (with which documents) did you verify yourself there?</p>
<p>Please note that according to the email from the casino that you shared earlier, they asked you for a payment method registered outside of Russia with EUR as currency. It means you would either register a new e-wallet while you are in a different country or use a VPN to hide your current location. However, in any case, you would be requested to verify yourself, which would not be very helpful since (as I assume) you have only Russian documents. Therefore, it would likely not make sense as well.</p>
<p>If you do not have a payment method that was requested by the casino, I am afraid there is nothing we or the casino can do for you. Fortunately, the disputed amount is not so high, so you would not leave much in your casino account. However, I would strongly recommend you wait until the casino informs you about an alternative solution or that its payment provider/processor releases the restrictions. But there is no time frame for that at all.</p>
