<p>Alberto Alfieri Appointed Chief Operating Officer</p>
<p>Market-leading B2B technology solutions provider Salsa Technology has appointed iGaming veteran Alberto Alfieri as its Chief Operating Officer. Alfieri’s appointment comes only a month after Salsa Technology’s decision to name Josh Thomas-Jones as Chief Technology Officer.</p>
<p>In his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Alfieri will be tasked with boosting Salsa Technology’s growth strategy and expanding its presence throughout Europe and Latin America. Based in Spain, Alfieri will helm several important commercial projects in the coming years and will lead product development and a talent acquisition drive for the company.</p>
<p>Alfieri is a well-known and proven iGaming veteran with over 12 years of experience in the booming industry. His long career began in the UK-based online gambling company bet365, where he played several distinct roles throughout the years, with a primary focus on product and player protection.</p>
<p>Management positions followed soon after Alfieri’s departure from bet365. The first such role was at Mr Green – a Malta-based online gambling operator – where Alfieri was responsible for creating and leading the company’s CRM department as well as its VIP client management unit.</p>
<p>Alfieri parted ways with Mr Green in 2016 and has taken on COO and CEO positions at several iGaming businesses, including Bet. pt, Vivagol, and Gamingtec. These positions helped the gaming veteran develop a more comprehensive understanding of the South American market – one of Salsa Technology’s target markets.</p>
<p>He is also well-versed in the African online gambling market, which might also prove highly beneficial for Salsa Technology given the rising global interest in the fledgling market.</p>
<p>Alfieri To Boost Salsa’s Latin American and European Growth Strategy</p>
<p>In regard to his new position as Chief Operating Officer, Alfieri said it was an honor to have the opportunity to play such a role for Salsa Technology, which he also lauded for its exceptional business growth.</p>
<p>According to him, his primary focus at the company will be around strengthening its market leadership position in the Latin American market and accelerate the expansion process in Europe. Furthermore, Alfieri stressed the importance of comprehensive player protection and said that the company would expand its toolset to guarantee higher protection and satisfaction for its customers.</p>
<p>In regard to Thomas-Jones, Salsa Technology’s new CTO, Alfieri said that the two had known each other for years.</p>
<p>“I have known our newly hired CTO Tromans-Jones for some time, and we share the same vision and objectives, so the collaboration will be total in order to fully meet Salsa’s ambitions,” – Alberto Alfieri, Salsa Technology Chief Operating Officer</p>
<p>Salsa Technology CEO Peter Nolte welcomed Alfieri into the company. He described Alfieri as a talented professional with a way of leading operations that leaves the company perfectly positioned for further growth.</p>
