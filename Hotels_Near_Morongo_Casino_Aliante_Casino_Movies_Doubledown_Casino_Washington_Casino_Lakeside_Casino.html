    <h1>Hotels Near Morongo Casino Aliante Casino Movies Doubledown Casino Washington Casino Lakeside Casino</h1>

<p>I never cashed out here.I went to do that and i got a message saying to send in documents.I sent them in and havent heard anything yet.Iwanted to login and see if i was approved to withdraw.This when i wasnt able to login.I think i spent over 400.00 in 1 night on 5 sites trying to cashout.I got very lucky and they might think im cheating.I have luck on and off.I won 50,0000 on lottery in 1994.Then 8,000.00 in 1999 at local casino..I have an account on over 160 differnt casinos.I do not work or have a job and play online for 22 years now.im on ssa/ssi and rent a room in moms house.My cars motor died and I have it at a shop.Ive been trying to raise the money to fix my car and setup a go fund me account for some help. https://gofund.me/56c15eff my car is signed by Jack roush and I got it along time back.I might know what is going on.Ive won alot of money in the last 2 weeks as I have had some good luck.over 5,000 has been won if I get it all.i think they think I'm cheating.I can't get into any of my accounts with this casino group.i just got 2650.00 from sloto cash casino last week.The check hasn't cleared yet.Then I win 3,300.00 on same game same site and cashed it out. So since I have won over 5,000.00 on thier sites I must be cheating? This is pretty messed up if you ask me. Even their sister sites that I didn't even win on I can't log in. It just seems weird that every site that I won on has locked me out. This I feel is wrong. Somebody has a good luck streak and they accuse them of cheating?</p>
