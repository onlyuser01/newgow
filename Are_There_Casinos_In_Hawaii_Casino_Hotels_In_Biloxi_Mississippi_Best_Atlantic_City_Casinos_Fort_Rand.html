<p>Estonia-based MeridianBet Group offers a unique betting product, which allows customers to create custom wagers not available anywhere else</p>
<p>The new betting offering called Empty Bet sets MeridianBet Group apart and helps it establish a distinct position in the markets where it operates.</p>
<p>MeridianBet’s Empty Bet Offers Unique Features</p>
<p>MeridianBet presents a rare betting experience with its innovative product, Empty Bet. It opens the door for patrons to place wagers on any human interaction event, from sports to politics, entertainment and beyond.</p>
<p>Unlike any other betting platform, MeridianBet offers odds on a limitless range of opportunities, enabling customers to put their knowledge and creativity to the test by creating their own unique bets.</p>
<p>This product has been a staple of MeridianBet’s offerings for a long time and has played a significant role in driving the company’s growth and success in the iGaming industry. MeridianBet is known for being ahead of the curve, introducing new and imaginative products years before they become common in the industry.</p>
<p>Empty Bet stands apart from the traditional bet builder options offered by other bookmakers. While a typical bet builder allows customers to combine several picks from different markets within a single game, Empty Bet gives patrons the freedom to submit their own innovative wager ideas, making it a one-of-a-kind betting experience.</p>
<p>As long as it adheres to legal, ethical, and industry norms, MeridianBet’s player base of over 3.2 million, gained through both online and brick-and-mortar channels, is free to place any kind of bet through either the company’s extensive online platform or its 735 physical retail locations spanning Europe, the Americas, and Africa.</p>
<p>MeridianBet Group Was Recently Acquired by Golden Matrix</p>
<p>At the beginning of January, Golden Matrix, a developer of gaming technology and content, reached a definitive agreement to purchase MeridianBet Group for a total cost of $300 million. This deal is going to provide Golden Matrix with entry into new markets through MeridianBet’s B2C business, which has been steadily growing across Europe, Africa, and Latin America. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2023, subject to the fulfillment of several customary conditions.</p>
<p>As part of the financial terms, Golden Matrix will issue approximately 65.3 million common shares to MeridianBet stockholders and pay $70 million in cash. The combination is expected to result in pro forma revenue of over $100 million and EBITDA of over $22 million in the fiscal year 2022.</p>
<p>At the close of the transaction, MeridianBet Group will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Matrix, and William Scott, a current advisor to MeridianBet Group, will become chairman of the board.</p>
