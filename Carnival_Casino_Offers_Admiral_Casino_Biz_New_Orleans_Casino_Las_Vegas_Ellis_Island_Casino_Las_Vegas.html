    <h1>Carnival Casino Offers Admiral Casino Biz New Orleans Casino Las Vegas Ellis Island Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>One of the most competitive betting and gaming medias has acquired Skycon Limited for a total consideration of £45 million ($55 million)</p>
<p>Skycon Limited will be brought under Better Collective’s roof and provide the established media company with a number of cutting-edge solutions that should help it to establish a more “audience-based” approach when seeking to further its marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Skycon will fit nicely with Better Collective’s existing Paid Media approach, helping the division significantly expand its addressable market and continue to add and promote value towards the Group’s overall business operations.</p>
<p>Better Collective’s New Acquisition to Be Scaled with Company’s Business</p>
<p>The new company will be integrated fully within the Paid Media operations by Better Collective, driving significant results for the company. There are many cross-selling synergies already identified and outlined by the sports media as well. For starters, Better Collective will take Skycon’s core offer and scale it up with multiple sportsbooks across the globe.</p>
<p>Better Collective will specifically focus on broadening Skycon’s reach with one of the focuses remaining markets in the United States. Skycon will further benefit from the AdTech platform that Better Collective is currently in the process of developing. Meanwhile, Better Collective will redirect future new depositing customers (NDC) to its best global sportsbook agreements, adding even more value to the NDCs in the first place.</p>
<p>The transaction will be based on two tranches – one is the £25 million ($31 million) offered upfront in cash and the other is a £20 million ($24 million) cash consideration based on earn-outs. Commenting on this opportunity, Better Collective CEO and Co-Founder Jesper Søgaard welcomed the chance to see this collaboration come to fruition:</p>
<p>We have invested heavily in growing our Paid Media division to reach its current significant scale, while we also have invested in moving revenues to recurring revenue share contracts. Better Collective CEO and Co-Founder Jesper Søgaard</p>
<p>He hailed Skycon as a company that would be “highly synergistic” to the company’s journey moving forward. According to Søgaard, the company already has an idea of how to scale the new acquisition and apply it to business partners and operations that will create even more value.</p>
