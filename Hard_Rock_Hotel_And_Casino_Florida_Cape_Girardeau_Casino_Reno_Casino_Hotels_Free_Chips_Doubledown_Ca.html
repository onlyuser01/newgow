<p>The ongoing trade war between the United States and China continues to hurt gaming industry stocks, especially those companies invested in Macau.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, and MGM Resorts are the three US-based casino operators that have properties in Macau, the world’s richest gambling hub that is a Special Administrative Region in China. Melco Resorts – headquartered in Hong Kong – is additionally traded on the NASDAQ.</p>
<p>Overall, the gaming industry is underperforming compared to the S&amp;P 500, the stock index comprised of 500 large companies traded on either the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or Cboe BZX Exchange. MGM and Wynn are both components of the S&amp;P.</p>
<p>Zacks research notes this week, “The trade war between Beijing and Washington continues to hurt gambling stocks. Moreover, the flagging China property price has adversely impacted the high-end VIP segment.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the industry underperformed the S&amp;P 500 for the second straight week. The industry has declined 1.9 percent compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 0.5 percent decrease,” the note concluded.</p>
<p>The Vectors Gaming ETF – an exchange-traded fund consisting of 43 gaming industry stocks – has gone from $39.96 a month ago to $35 this week, a 12.4 percent decrease. Sands accounts for nearly 16 percent of the fund’s assets.</p>
<p>Trade Tensions</p>
<p>As of May 10, President Donald Trump elevated tariffs to the tune of $200 billion on various Chinese goods. The tax increased the toll from 10 percent to 25 percent.</p>
<p>In response, China said it will be raising tariffs on American goods effective June 1. The upsurge will increase product costs by $60 billion.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted recently, “When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited, but as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
<p>He added last week, “The real trade war began 30 years ago, and we lost. This is a bright new Age, the Age of Enlightenment. We don’t lose anymore!”</p>
<p>In the interim, however, investors in certain gaming industry stocks are indeed losing.</p>
<p>30-Day Stock Performances Las Vegas Sands – Down 16 percent MGM Resorts – Down 11 percent Wynn Resorts – Down 22 percent</p>
<p>It’s not only the US gaming operators invested in China that are bleeding cash. Caesars Entertainment is down six percent, Melco Resorts down 20 percent, and Galaxy Entertainment 21 percent.</p>
<p>Half-Year Performances</p>
<p>Investors buying gaming industry stocks primarily focused on the US are also experiencing turmoil.</p>
<p>Penn National – one of the largest regional casino operators – has decreased in value around five percent over the last 30 days. Boyd Gaming has lost more than 13 percent.</p>
<p>However, over the last six months, many gaming operators have fared just fine. Wynn is up 7.1 percent, Caesars 4.1 percent, Melco 15 percent, and Sands 8.3 percent.</p>
<p>Only MGM (-5.6 percent) and Penn (-5.7 percent) have lost share value during the half-year period.</p>
