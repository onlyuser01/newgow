<p>The Panthers vs. Bears Week 10 TNF odds are out, and they suggest we’re going to see a real battle at Chicago’s Soldier Field. The Bears are 3-point favorites, the probable reason being that the Panthers have been horrible on the road in the 2023 NFL season.</p>
<p>However, the last time they played in Chicago, they beat the Bears. Still, it was more than four years ago when they had Christian McCaffrey on the team. In 2023, their roster just doesn’t look great. But on the other hand, the same applies to their Week 10 opponents as well.</p>

<p>Carolina Panthers Need to Up Their Defensive Game</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers are 1-7 in the 2023 NFL season, winning their only game two weeks ago against the Houston Texans with 15-13 on the scoreline. You would think that 15 points isn’t much, but this season, they’ve scored fewer points in another three games.</p>
<p>The highest number of points they’ve scored so far in the 2023 season is 27 in the game with the Seattle Seahawks. These guys are averaging 17.5 points per game, which makes their offense the 6th-worst in the NFL.</p>
<p>If you thought Carolina’s offense was bad, wait to learn about this team’s defense. With 28.3 points conceded per game, the Panthers are in the shared-bottom place when opponents’ points are concerned.</p>
<p>The Panthers’ defense is even worse when it comes to points conceded on the road. They’re allowing 36.3 points on average in away games.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears Hoping for Another Home Win</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears are 2-7 this season, but they’re on a two-loss skid. Both of those games, however, were played on the road. The last time the Bears played at Soldier Field, they defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 30-12.</p>
<p>This is the last time Justin Fields played a full football game.</p>
<p>But between throwing 10 passes and getting hurt. He somehow turned into Jamarcus Russell. pic.twitter.com/mB9ZIS9buq — illwill (@79illwill) November 5, 2023</p>
<p>Rookie QB Tyson Bagent did okay in that game, exceeding the expectations the Bears’ fans had for him following the injury of Justin Fields. Speaking of Fields, Chicago’s No. 1 quarterback is ready to make his comeback after missing the last three games.</p>
<p>Before injuring his shoulder in the Minnesota Vikings game (which the Bears lost 19-13), he did great against the Washington Commanders on the road. He went 15-for-29 for 282 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Carolina Panthers vs. Chicago Bears Prediction</p>
<p>Bagent or Fields? It doesn’t matter who’s gonna be the Bears signal-caller in the TNF game, Chicago’s offense should have no problems dealing with Carolina’s defense. The Bears are averaging 20.9 PPG, and we think they’re gonna go over their average this Thursday. What about their defense? They should be able to handle the Panthers, the result of which is that the Bears should win and cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Chicago Beats -3</p>
