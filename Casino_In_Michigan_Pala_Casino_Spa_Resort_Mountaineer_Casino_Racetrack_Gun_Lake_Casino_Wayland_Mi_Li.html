<p>Miami Dolphins vs San Francisco 49ers is one of the most exciting matchups of Week 13. The Niners are 7-4 in 2022; the Dolphins are even better with an 8-3 record. That said, both teams will almost certainly get to the NFL playoffs.</p>
<p>Both teams are in top shape, each winning every single game in November. For one of these two, however, the winning run ends on Sunday. So, who’s it going to be – Miami on San Fran?</p>

<p>Miami Dolphins Looking for Their Sixth Straight Win</p>
<p>The Dolphins have been fantastic this season, especially in the last two months. Their quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had some problems with fitness, for which he had to miss two games in October. However, since returning, he’s been brilliant, throwing for 12 TDs in the five games he’s played since.</p>
<p>Through 30 career starts, Tua Tagovailoa has</p>
<p>-More passing yards than Tom Brady</p>
<p>-Fewer INTs than Aaron Rodgers</p>
<p>-More passing TDs than Joe Montana</p>
<p>-Higher completion % than Kurt Warner pic.twitter.com/O7DSA4Q93i — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) November 28, 2022</p>
<p>Most of those TD passes were caught by wide receivers Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill, along with tight end Mike Gesicki. Thanks to their impressive offense, the Dolphins were able to score 30+ points in each of their last four games. Their defense has been almost as equally impressive over that period, conceding under 20 in the previous two games.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Miami’s most recent game was against the Houston Texans, which is why it’s not surprising that they were able to do well defensively. And the game before that was against the Cleveland Browns who are still waiting for Deshaun Wilson to make his debut (it may happen this weekend, actually).</p>
<p>Knowing all this, the Dolphins do need to worry about their defense in Week 13 when they’re taking on one of the strongest offenses in the NFL.</p>
<p>San Francisco 49ers Looking Really Good Right Now</p>
<p>The Dolphins are conceding 23.3 points per game on average, which makes their defense the 19th-best in the league. Meanwhile, the Niners’ defense is the best in the NFL with just 15.7 PPG allowed.</p>
<p>The Niners are also decent in the offense with 22.6 PPG, and we think that number is going to increase before the end of the regular season. The thing is that with running back Christian McCaffrey now on the roster, San Francisco’s offense has plenty of weapons in the arsenal.</p>

<p>Plus, the 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is playing better and better with each week. He looks very confident after going four weeks without throwing a single interception. If he does it again, he’s going to break a personal record.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>We honestly believe that the San Francisco 49ers are Super Bowl Material. They look strong in literally all aspects of the game and they’re going to show it against the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>We think Kyle Shanahan’s boys are going to annihilate the Dolphins’ defense, while also keeping Tua &amp; Co. to under 20 points. As a result, the Niners should win and cover the spread on Sunday.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
