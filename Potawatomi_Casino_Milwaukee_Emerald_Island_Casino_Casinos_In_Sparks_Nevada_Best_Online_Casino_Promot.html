<p>Wild Frames review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Frames is one of those slots that doesn’t have a clear theme or story. Instead it focuses on creating a particular ambience – in this case, the tone is a cross between a Vegas stage show and a flashy hotel lobby.</p>
<p>The reels have bells and card suits on them. But nothing of any great originality. What’s there is stylish enough, but it doesn’t add up to much.</p>
<p>Win in the Wild Frames slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics make up for the lack of theme. The atmosphere is glitzy and pleasant. The animations are varied and shiny.</p>
<p>The background of abstract art deco lines would work well as a fancy wallpaper.</p>
<p>But the real selling point is the music. It is upbeat but avoids annoying the player. And it is dynamic with beats shifting in and out as wins occur and stepping down when spins are spun.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Frames is a seven by seven grid game in which winning combinations occur when five or more symbols land in a cluster (joined horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).</p>
<p>Winning symbols are removed and a cascade occurs where further symbols fall down from above.</p>
<p>Bonuses are managed by a counter on the side of the grid (details below).</p>
<p>Wild Card random feature can trigger after any non-winning game round</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. When a Wild lands, it creates a Wild Frame wherever it ends up. These Frames become active when the Wild Frames feature is triggered.</p>
<p>For each symbol that is part of a winning combination, the bonus Meter increases by one. It resets at the end of every spin.</p>
<p>Shatter feature triggers when you reach at least 60 on the counter</p>
<p>As the Bonus Meter fills, it triggers bonuses. When the Meter hits 20, all high paying symbols transform into one matching high paying symbol. At 40, the Meter triggers three to six additional Wilds, which are added at random to the grid. At 60, all the low paying symbols are removed, triggering a cascade.</p>
<p>At 80, all Wild Frames are transformed into Wilds, with additional multipliers added for additional numbers on the Meter.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.50%, comfortably above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a great match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>High symbols paytable for Wild Frames slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Wild Frames is a stylish grid based game with fun bonus features, similar to other Play'n GO slots.</p>
<p>The Bonus Meter makes every spin an exciting sweat and the high volatility ramps that excitement up – it also makes it a good match for our slot strategies.</p>
<p>Add a high RTP, and here you have a great slot that we are happy to recommend.</p>
