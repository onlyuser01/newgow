<p>Push Gaming has brought out a new dinosaur-themed and inspired game, that will have you rolling for big wins, and escaping the claws of all sorts of apex predators</p>
<p>The new title, Dino P.D. is inspired by a previous game by the company, Dinopolis, and will now add to the supplier’s sprawling portfolio of excellent games to try and test first-hand.</p>
<p>Dino P.D. Metrics</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 4</p>
<p>Paylines: 20</p>
<p>RTP: 96.38%</p>
<p>Max win: 10,000x</p>
<p>Volatility: Medium/High</p>
<p>Min/Max bet: 0.10-100</p>
<p>Jurassic Spins to Win</p>
<p>Dino P.D. is a worthwhile successor of Dinopolis, but it stands well on its own as a game. The new release features 20 paylines and is played on a five-by-four grid. It comes with a great return-to-player (RTP) rate of 96.38%.</p>
<p>The game features a bunch of excellent symbols that are designed to help you win more on the available 20 paylines. Players get to enjoy a 1,000x payout on each of the Dino Coins symbols they get on the reels that can send their winnings soaring and add in a big way to your gaming session. The value of the Dino Coins can be anything from 1x to the aforementioned 1,000x with luck playing a role in determining the outcome.</p>
<p>Dino P.D. also comes with a dedicated bonus round which will offer you a chance to retrigger various free spins and increase your multipliers so that you keep adding to your prize purse. There are different scatters to explore in the game, including the Gamble Scatter, which will trigger the free spins level.</p>
<p>AS to the free spins you can access, there are basically several levels, including the Bronze, Silver and Gold Free Spins which will get you various perks. During the Gold Free Spins, you will get 8-10 free spins levels with 4 low-pay symbols swapped out for Dino Coins. Oh, and there is also the gambling feature that will further improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Certain jurisdictions can also have their players benefit from the Bonus Buy feature in Dino P.D. which will allow you to jump into play right away. Overall, this is a tight game mechanically and graphically.</p>
<p>What Does the Studio Say?</p>
<p>Push Gaming group managing director Georgi Fil has welcomed the arrival of Dino P.D. as the latest slot in the company’s family. The game brings a lot to the table, with its recognizable theme and the fact that it’s based on an established part of the company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>The features that made the original game, Dinopolis, a hit are also present here, but they have been given a proper overhaul as well.</p>
<p>“We’re really proud of the various mechanics we’ve worked into the gameplay. Especially Dino coins, which unlock more thrilling levels that we think players are going to love,” Fil concluded, adding that he is looking forward to seeing others enjoy the game as much as everyone else.</p>
