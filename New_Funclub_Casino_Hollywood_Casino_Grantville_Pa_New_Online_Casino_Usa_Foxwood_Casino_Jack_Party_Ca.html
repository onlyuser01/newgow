<p>Hello Nick ,</p>
<p>They didn't closed my account , Its just suspended (not Functional), sports bets, slots and withdrawal not working (nothing actually working) , I can login but cant play , I have no idea when did they suspend the account , they never send me an email or explain anything to me , They give no reason or no email which is kind of suspicious , I contact onsite support and they told me to send an email to security team which i did , security team replied after 3 days with a link to verify my account , which i already did in account TAB , But any ways i verified once again on there provided link and now its third day no response , Onsite chat always says we forward your request to security team , like what security team ? its 2022 , i am playing on stake and they reply within seconds no delay no security team kind of thing , I am now concerned that they will make excuses and eat my 5K , which is a pure scam . I joined there casino last week of FEB this year after i win 1 Million Dollars on stake , the slot i won on was from push gaming (Bison battle) , I want to try that slot on another casino to try my luck , so i came to this casino , I lost around 30K ,After the last 5K deposit my account is no longer working .</p>
<p>Never seen such kind of thing when you pay with crypto and when you lost all money and not taking a dime out ,</p>
<p>Ok if i win something and i have to withdraw yeah they suppose to check me for kyc or proof of funds , but not when i am loosing , Now i go throw kyc twice and still account not working .</p>
<p>i am feeling for those who play via Credit card or bank deposit .</p>
<p>Read couple of reviews about this casino and i see they have scammed alot of people in past as well in the name of kyc .</p>
<p>I will take my 5K back and never play on this casino .</p>
<p>Just waiting for security team reply this is third day .</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Johni T<strong>*</strong></p>
