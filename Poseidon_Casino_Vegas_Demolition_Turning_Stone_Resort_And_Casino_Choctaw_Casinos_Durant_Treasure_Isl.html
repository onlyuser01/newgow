    <h1>Poseidon Casino Vegas Demolition Turning Stone Resort And Casino Choctaw Casinos Durant Treasure Isl</h1>

<p>EGT Digital, an online casino games provider, announced a new deal, strengthening its presence in Europe. The company confirmed it joined forces with the leading brand operated by Kaizen Gaming, Stoiximan. Thanks to the latest collaboration, players of the brand in Greece will be able to access thrilling games from EGT Digital.</p>
<p>The new partnership marks the debut of the iGaming supplier's games in the European country. Per the new agreement, Stoiximan's Greek customers will benefit from engaging EGT Digital games, including Clover Chance, Single Progressive Jackpot, Bell Link and High Cash.</p>
<p>The latest collaboration sees EGT Digital complement its European expansion. The launch in Greece with Stoiximan comes after the iGaming supplier secured a license in the country recently. Back in December, EGT Digital was awarded a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission, enabling the Bulgarian iGaming content provider to deliver its games to customers in the country.</p>
<p>Tsvetomira Drumeva, EGT Digital's Head of Sales, shared her excitement about the newly-inked partnership in Greece. "It is a pleasure for us that the first gaming platform to present our gaming content to local players is the leading brand Stoiximan," she explained in a statement. Finally, Drumeva said: "Over the next 4 months, our games will be available exclusively there, which will guarantee us a very strong market position and pave the way for more successes in the future."</p>
<p>Vangelis Dedoulis, Kaizen Gaming's Director of Product, Gaming &amp; Rewards, was similarly delighted and predicted that the deal with EGT Digital would bring benefits for the two companies. "The Bulgarian providerâ€™s slots are widely popular among our customers in Romania and Bulgaria, so the next logical step was to offer them to another market," he added. Finally, Dedoulis said: "I am confident that they will prove to be a big hit with Greek gaming enthusiasts too."</p>
<p>Recently, EGT Digital announced another European-facing partnership. Earlier this month, the company boosted its presence on the Old Continent by teaming up with Betsson. Under the terms of that deal, the iGaming content supplier agreed to deliver its games for Betsson's RIZK brand in Croatia. As a result, new customers were able to access EGT Digital's engaging iGaming content, promising exceptional experiences and thrilling gameplay.</p>
