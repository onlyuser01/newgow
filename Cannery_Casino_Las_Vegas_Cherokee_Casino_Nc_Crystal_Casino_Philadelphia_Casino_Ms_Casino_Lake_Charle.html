    <h1>Cannery Casino Las Vegas Cherokee Casino Nc Crystal Casino Philadelphia Casino Ms Casino Lake Charle</h1>

<p>Dear LaTasha,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your negative experience. Please could you clarify what the problem is? I have checked with live chat and players are allowed to deposit with more than one bank card, as long as the card is registered on their name.</p>
<p>This is what I found in regard to withdrawals:</p>
<p>"Cash outs will be credited to a player’s original deposit method, unless otherwise offered by the site. If you cannot receive your cashout through your original method of deposit, please contact us."</p>
<p>Why your deposits are being returned to you? Have you been accused of multiple accounts or breaching depositing rules? I hope, we will be able to help you as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
