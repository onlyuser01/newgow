    <h1>Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Vegas Casino Online Real Money Casinos Near Phoenix Az Dreamers Casi</h1>

<p>The parent behind the gambling startup focused on microbetting, Betr, announced today an exclusive partnership with sports and social media personalities, Haley and Hanna Cavinder, known as The Cavinder Twins.</p>
<p>Attract Emerging Talent</p>
<p>The agreement announced by Betr Holdings, Inc. makes the popular twin sisters equity partners, content creators and creative directors for Betr and brings their popular podcast, Twin Talk, exclusively to Betr Media.</p>
<p>Thrilled to partner with The Cavinder Twins, the founder and chief executive officer of Betr, Joey Levy, outlined the agreement as part of Betr media’s strategy “to become the #1 destination for emerging talent,” hailing the accomplishments of the twin sisters and that they are barely “scratching the surface of their potential.”</p>
<p>“Betr Media’s objective is to attract, enhance, and amplify the next wave of generational content creators, and this partnership is a testament to that approach,” he said, adamant that the company’s “talent flywheel” will continue to get stronger.</p>
<p>Fit for Betr’s Sports Audiences</p>
<p>The partnership will see The Cavinder Twins become foundational on-camera talent by creating female-centric sports content within the company. Haley and Hanna are seen as the perfect conduit between Betr and the bulk of its audience consisting of sports betting fans aged between 21-34 years.</p>
<p>“Betr gives us the ability to accelerate the growth of The Cavinder Twins brand in a focused and truly authentic manner,” commented The Cavinder Twins, outlining their love for sports and competition and their passion to create and bring ideas to life, convinced that with Betr their brand will become much better and bigger.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, The Cavinder Twins will also regularly appear on Betr Media’s franchise BS w/Jake Paul and on other Betr Media content across all platforms to present their experience-based perspectives on sports.</p>
<p>In December 2022, after their successful NCAA Division 1 basketball careers with the University of Miami and Fresno State and their growing popularity in social media, Haley and Hanna founded the Twin Talk podcast on iHeartRadio, and now Twin Talk is joining the likes of 100x Club, Handshake Bets, Betr Combat w/Bo Nickal, Everybody Hates Derek, and BS w/Jake Paul in Betr’s roster of shows and brands.</p>
<p>Jeff Hoffman, agent of The Cavinder Twins and Partner ESM, hailed the partnership, comparing it to “adding jet fuel to an already burning fire,” and adamant that by making the twins equity partners and creating directors, it provides “a vested interest and ability [for the sisters] to do what they do best: continue to define culture and content.”</p>
<p>Since Betr’s inception in 2022, Betr Media has been growing fast by attracting audiences passionate about sports and pop culture, helping Betr reach recently over 900 million impressions and 50 million engagements across social media.</p>
