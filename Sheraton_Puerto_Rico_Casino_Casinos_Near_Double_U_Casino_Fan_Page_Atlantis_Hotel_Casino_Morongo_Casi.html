<p>Comments by New South Wales RSL and Services Clubs CEO, Margot Smith, against the cashless gaming card proposed by the NSW Crime Commission have caused pushback from executives and experts from other RSL branches dubbing Smith’s statements as harmful</p>
<p>The Guardian reported that the quarterly RSL and Services Clubs magazine called Focus Magazine published a commentary piece by New South Wales RSL and Services Clubs CEO Margot Smith, who urged members to protest against the cashless gaming card, which has been proposed by the New South Wales Crime Commission as a means to fight money laundering at gambling venues.</p>
<p>NSW RSL CEO Opposes Cashless Gaming Cards</p>
<p>In her article in Focus Magazine, Margot Smith vouched for a more balanced view on gambling, which has been part of people’s lives since ancient times. Smith argued that the debate on gambling has been quite one-sided and the RSL and Services Clubs should take a stand.</p>
<p>Smith urges organization members to particularly raise their voices against the introduction of the cashless gaming card as it may have unexpected consequences for the industry.</p>
<p>Smith argues that the introduction of cashless cards will be a rushed decision implemented without the necessary research. She points out that currently, gambling companies are trialing digital wallet options that could provide a better solution.</p>
<p>She also highlights that cashless cards do not solve any of the gambling harm issues but focus only on money laundering. Smith advocates for waiting and allowing for more options to be explored that would also support people that are suffering from gambling harm and addiction.</p>
<p>Smith is not the only one against cashless cards. Heated debates about them have been going on for the last few months. The proposition for this solution came from the NSW Crime Commission, however, it has been met with many protests, including from industry representative bodies such as ClubsNSW.</p>
<p>Margot Smith’s comments caused a stir among RSL members and executives. For example, Eamon Hale, president of the Hawthorn, Victoria, RSL division, said he finds Smith’s article very disappointing. Hale sees the RSL’s dependence on gambling as too strong and detrimental to veterans.</p>
<p>Hale said that gambling causes harm to vulnerable people and the RSL is an organization that is supposedly helping vulnerable members of society. Hale is of the opinion that the RSL should not rely on gambling revenues at all. The Hawthorn RSL division does not offer poker machines.</p>
<p>Dr. John Crozier, an RSL member and chair of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons trauma committee, has also condemned Smith’s comments. Crozier said that the RSL should be a social organization helping veterans but instead, it has been focusing too much on profit from gambling activities.</p>
