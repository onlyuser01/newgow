<p>Book of Immortals review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Book of Immortals seems to have taken their visual style from the kind of sci-fi rendering of Egyptian myth that worked so well in Stargate. And here, where every other slot seems to be ancient Egypt themed and entitled Book of X… this one gives the player something a little distinctive to latch onto.</p>
<p>It probably isn’t enough on its own, and, unfortunately, Book of Immortals shows no sign of wanting to build on its theme.</p>
<p>Even a win with the top paying symbol is relatively small because of a lower volatility of the slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics on Book of Immortals are excellent with great animations, decent sound design and a relevant, non-annoying soundtrack that creates real atmosphere.</p>
<p>However well executed the art, the concepts guiding them show no imagination. Instead, we are given just yet another standard slot with a few hieroglyphs in place of real individuality.</p>
<p>Random scarabs feature in Book of Immortals slot</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Book of Immortals base game is a standard five reel slot with ten winlines and just a few basic enhancements discussed in full in the section below.</p>
<p>As a result, the gameplay is a little bit bland with no mini-games or gamble features to spice things up.</p>
<p>The only concession to creativity is that at random on some base game spins, up to ten symbols will be changed to identical symbols by a swarm of Scarab beetles.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins bonus</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol in Book of Immortals stands in for all other symbols. It also serves as both a Scatter and a Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Hitting three Wilds or more wilds in one spin will trigger 10 free spins. On top of that three Wilds wins twice your bet per spin, four Wilds nets you twenty times your bet, and five gets you two-hundred times your bet.</p>
<p>During the free spins an additional reel is added at the top, separate from the main reels. This additional reel chooses a symbol at random. When that symbol comes up in a spin, after paying out, it expands to fill up any reel that it appeared at. Game pays out all 10 winlines, even on non-adjacent reels. The chosen symbol remains active until it is used in a winning combination. After that, a new symbol is chosen.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you win with one of the God symbols, it becomes immortal and expands for the duration of Free Spins bonus. You can unlock more than one immortal symbol during one bonus game.</p>
<p>After it expands a new symbol is chosen in the additional reel. You can win extra free spins if the Extra Spins symbol lands on the additional reel.</p>
<p>Paytable for Book of Immortals slot</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.31%. A little over our yardstick of ~96%, but not enough to get us really excited.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum of $/£/€0.10 to a maximum bet per spin of $/£/€100.00, which should comfortably cover most bankrolls.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low to medium, making it wholly unsuitable for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>iSoftBet's slot Book of Immortals is uncreative in presentation, lacklustre in its vital statistics, and tedious in its gameplay.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you go play something else.</p>
