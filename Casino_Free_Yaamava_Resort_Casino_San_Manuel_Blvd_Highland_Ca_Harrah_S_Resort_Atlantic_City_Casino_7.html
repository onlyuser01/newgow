<p>The next chair is set to step into the office on July 1, 2024, the date of Jansen’s departure</p>
<p>René Jansen, the current board chairman of the Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), will not reapply for the position once his term expires. As announced by the authority, Jansen has opted not to continue his work because he will reach retirement age at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>According to the KSA, the outgoing chair’s current term is set to expire on October 1, 2024, meaning that he still has several months remaining at the helm of the Dutch regulator. However, he will likely vacate the position on July 1, 2024.</p>
<p>The KSA is already on the lookout for Jansen’s successor. The next KSA chair will be appointed by the Netherlands’ Minister for Legal Protection and will serve a mandate of six years, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The KSA added that the recruitment of a new chair will be done through the General Administrative Service (ABD). Interested parties can file applications by November 12, 2023. The approved candidate is set to step into the office on July 1, 2024, the same date as Jansen’s resignation.</p>
<p>Jansen Said His Successor Will Have a Lot to Do</p>
<p>René Jansen commented on his departure, expressing his thoughts on the matter. He noted that the recent years saw him fully committed to the Kansspelautoriteit’s mission to protect the Dutch market from fraud and gambling harm. He said that it has been a pleasure to lead the KSA but added that there will be many great challenges to his successor.</p>
<p>Jansen added that the KSA has a huge responsibility toward the Dutch market. This management position, he added, is challenging and “requires creativity, innovation and decisiveness.” Above all, the KSA’s mission has great social value, Jansen concluded.</p>
<p>In other news, the KSA just published its 2022 Market Scan and provided insights into the performance of the regulated Dutch market. The scan complements the recently published industry report that highlighted the need for evolving responsible gambling practices.</p>
