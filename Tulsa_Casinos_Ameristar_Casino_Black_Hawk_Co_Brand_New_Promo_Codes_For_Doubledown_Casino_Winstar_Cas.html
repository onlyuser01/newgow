    <h1>Tulsa Casinos Ameristar Casino Black Hawk Co Brand New Promo Codes For Doubledown Casino Winstar Cas</h1>

<p>A guy on instagram told me that by algorithm you could win a lot of money in this casino. I tried it, he told me that if I put in €55 I would win €650 depending on his rhythm. So I did, I loaded my account 55 and followed his pattern, I won 250. As he promised me 650 I told him that it didn't work and he told me to change the game following another pattern he gave me. I lost everything without finishing the pattern, I told him about it and he told me to enter 60 this time and gave me another pattern and another game. In the end I got 318, clearly I have been cheated. The problem comes, when on the casino page you want to withdraw your funds...</p>
<p>They ask for photos of documents, the DNI on both sides, a utility bill and photos of the credit card on both sides.</p>
<p>The case is that I provided all the documentation, on the back of the card I obviously deleted the CCV number and now they tell me that I need to sign behind the card. I have done so, I am waiting for the documents to be approved in order to withdraw the money. We'll see what happens, but I've tried to get in touch through the phone that you put on your website and nothing, I've only been able to contact through chat and they haven't clarified much. Honestly, I don't recommend it, with all the documentation they ask for they can impersonate your identity and steal your money (I cross my fingers so it doesn't happen to me). I don't know how normal this is...</p>
