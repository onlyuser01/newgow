<p>OVERVIEW OF WILD CASINO</p>
<p>Wild Casino is an established purveyor of gaming products and the online casino market. With three years of relevant operating experience under the Wild Casino brand, the operator is no odd name in the iGaming industry. The website was set up in 2017 and operated by Commission.bz, the company behind other worthwhile brands, such as BetOnline and Sportsbetting.ag. Today, Wild Casino stands tall as one of the most recognized names in iGaming, offering an array of banking options, a very tempting $5,000 cash welcome bonus, mobile gameplay, and over 200 games to pick from. We have taken a closer look at the brand in our dedicated Wild Casino review.</p>
<p>Why Play at WildCasino.ag?</p>
<p>Each casino has its strengths and its weakness. Wild Casino balances perfectly between a state-of-the-art casino product and any drawbacks players may perceive. Here is what our Wild Casino review indicates that you may find useful and also what you may consider a bit of a downside.</p>

<p>Over 200 quality games to pick from</p>
<p>Compatibility with Windows, Android, iOS</p>

<p>The FAQ section could be improved with additional queries</p>
<p>Wild Casino Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Touted as one of the largest welcome bonuses you can claim, the $5,000 Wild Casino welcome bonus is definitely tempting. Yet, anyone who knows something about wagering requirements may question the practicality of such a large sum. Wild Casino seems to be way ahead of players in this regard, and the $5,000 is distributed across five individual deposits, each with its own transparent and accessible terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Your first deposit will be matched at 250% up to $1,000, making for a delightful promotion and a great way to get yourself started. The bonus cash is triggered with the promo code WILD250. You must deposit at least $20 to trigger the bonus, which will then be subject to 35x applied to both the deposit and bonus amount. All players have 30 days to clear the bonus conditions, with the bonus applicable to slots, table games and video poker only.</p>
<p>The remaining $4,000 you will receive as part of four subsequent deposits. Each deposit will match your money by 100% up to $1,000. The minimum deposit you ought to make here is $20, but the wagering requirement is slightly more accommodating, with the playthrough requirement at 30x for both your deposit and bonus. You will need to type in the WILD100 bonus code every time you make a cash deposit to claim the remaining four bonus opportunities.</p>
<p>Wild Casino Bonus Codes</p>
<p>Wild Casino uses promo codes for nearly every promotion it runs. This way, Wild stays on top of which bonuses are distributed and where they go. Most casinos prefer to automate the process, but Wild Casino doesn’t mind sticking with bonus codes which, anyway, make players feel a little more involved. You can find all Wild Casino bonus codes under the terms and conditions of each respective offer.</p>
<p>Going Crypto with Wild Casino</p>
<p>Besides the regular welcome bonus, Wild Casino offers a crypto first deposit bonus up to $9,000 paid out in Bitcoin (BTC). The promotion will once again operate to specific wagering requirements. You can claim the first deposit up to $3,000 matched by 300%. The qualifying deposit is $20 and the wagering requirement on both the deposit and bonus is 45x for the first deposit. To access the promotion, you will need to use the CRYPTO300 promo code.</p>
<p>The rest of the $6,000 will be allocated across four deposits, each worth $1,500 and subject to a 30x wagering requirement. If you are a crypto enthusiast, then having a go at this promotion shouldn’t be too much hassle at all. Just remember to punch in the CRYPTO150 code to activate the promotion.</p>
<p>Wild Casino Promotions</p>
<p>Wild Casino makes access to their promotion pages very easy and clear. They have one of the biggest selections of promotions, making it tempting for its users to enjoy and explore their platform. If you feel the welcome package is already good enough, you wait until you see what other goodies this online casino has secreted away.</p>
<p>Some of these promotions will be more seasonal in natural and available for limited time. Yet, other promos, such as the $500 VIP Reload Bonus are there to help you continue to play once you have established yourself at the casino.</p>
<p>Slots Stampede</p>
<p>Slots Stampede offers you a crack at delightful prize money. The stampede runs from Monday to Wednesday and all you need to do to qualify is wager $500 or more during the three days of fiery slots action. If you qualify, you will get your 10 Free Spins to use on the following Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>Hump Day Special</p>
<p>Tap into Wild Casino’s Hump Day special to get a 25-50% match offer up to $250. To qualify, you need to deposit at least $30 and, should you deposit over $150, your bonus amount will be matched by 50%. This promotion requires promo codes, so don’t miss out on these.</p>
<p>VIP Reload</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a VIP member to enjoy a VIP Reload bonus. With the 50% VIP bonus you can claim up to $500 every Sunday, making it a very good way to top up your bankroll at the end of the week and start the following one on a good footing.</p>
<p>Refer A Friend</p>
<p>If you want to have an even better experience at Wild Casino, you might want to consider bringing your friends over. Wild Casino is happy to extend the Refer A Friend promo which allows you and your friends to benefit from a neat bonus and yet another great way to improve your stay. You can earn up to $200 matched by 200% on your friends’ first deposit.</p>
<p>Wild Casino Games &amp; Software Developers</p>
<p>Wild Casino has developed a great casino offer, featuring over 200 games that players globally love. Several companies have made this possible, not least Nucleus Gaming, which is the underlying software platform that powers the casino. The casino also has games by Betsoft Gaming, a developer of quality 3D gaming products that many players find some of the best they have had the chance to play.</p>
<p>Betsoft offers regular slots, jackpot games, and many spot-on table games. Wild Casino has spread all available games across several categories, including Table Games, Video Poker, Slots, Blackjack and not least – Live Dealer. Let’s take a closer look at each of these.</p>
<p>Online Slots</p>
<p>You will find no shortage of excellent slot games at Wild Casino. The casino’s choice to partner with Betsoft has given it a distinct opportunity to establish its footprint and stand out among competitors. Players will find exciting games such as Howling at the Moon, Mr. Vegas, Back to Venus, and brand-new releases.</p>
<p>In fact, Wild Casino has been systematically adding new exciting games, and specifically, as of the time of our Wild Casino review, those games included titles as Bounty of Troy, Stellar Strikers, Mystic Grounds, Domino Town Vice, Slots Tournament and Quest to the West.</p>
<p>Thanks to Betsoft, every game is mobile-friendly and can be played from any browser or handheld mobile device (Android and iOS). Some of our side-pick favorites include Mystic Rift, Monster Pop and Take the Bank and we recommend you give them a shot. All games are available For Fun as well as for Real Money.</p>
<p>Live Casino Dealer Games</p>
<p>Next on the menu, we have another exquisite product for you. The casino’s live section is outstanding, providing players with the opportunity to place hefty bets ranging from a mere $1 all the way up to $5,000.</p>
<p>The live dealer games have been provided by Global Gaming Labs, and you can access every fun classic title you remember, including Blackjack, Baccarat, Roulette and Punto 2000. There are lots of different live dealer tables you can visit and enjoy right now. The following games are found under Wild Casino Red, which is one of the two live dealer sections at the casino.</p>
<p>Blackjack – Live Blackjack at Wild Casino is pretty awesome. You will have access to 14 blackjack tables, four of which are exclusive. The bet limits range from $5 to $5,000 offering some pretty competitive play to take place.</p>

Baccarat – Live Baccarat at Wild Casino tends to be a little more interactive and casual in nature with the live dealers generally being slightly chattier. The table limits start at $5 and go all the way up to $5,000.</p>
<p>– Live Baccarat at Wild Casino tends to be a little more interactive and casual in nature with the live dealers generally being slightly chattier. The table limits start at $5 and go all the way up to $5,000. Punto 2000 – For those of you who want to do something different, Punto 2000 is a great alternative with still pretty flexible betting limits ($1 – $5,000) and a very competitive edge and feel to the game.</p>
<p>If you take a quick trip to Wild Casino Black, you will find yet more live dealer games brought to you by Fresh Deck Studios’ dedicated live lobby.</p>
<p>Video Poker</p>
<p>Wild Casino video poker is definitely worth your while. The casino features some 26 excellent versions of this vastly underestimated game which pays some of the most impressive sums. The average RTP here is over 99.26% and you can choose from Single, Multi-hand and Pyramid Poker. All of these games have some slight differences in the gameplay that make them an absolute blast to try.</p>
<p>Table &amp; Card Games</p>
<p>Wild Casino crafted the table and card games section with a giving hand, offering a variety of excellent choices you can enjoy. There are 11 versions of roulette and craps, 12 blackjack games, six table poker games, and six games such as Casino War, Draw High-Low, and Keno Megaways listed under Other Tables.</p>
<p>You will find quite a few card games, too, including Blackjack Tournament, Single Deck BJ, Pirate 21, Oasis Poker, Ride ‘M Poker, and many others. The games have neat, flexible betting limits, allowing everyone to benefit from the experience on their own time.</p>
<p>Whether you like shooting craps, playing poker, or sitting down at a blackjack table, you will find all of this and more at Wild Casino.</p>
<p>Wild Casino Banking Methods</p>
<p>Wild Casino has a number of viable payment options you can use to deposit and withdraw money in a way that is convenient to you. All payment options are flexible, allowing you to benefit from zero fee and quick transactions. There are 13 deposit methods and eight withdrawal methods.</p>
<p>The minimum deposit will vary between $20 and $50 based on the payment option you use. Most banking options will let you deposit up to $2,500, but for Bitcoin, you can go all the way up to $100,000 which makes it one of the selling points of Wild Casino. Withdrawals however will be limited to $3,000 per transaction with each transaction processed within 48 hours.</p>
<p>One minor drawback is that the Terms and Conditions of the website, nor the Payout FAQ provide any information as to the maximum payout available at the casino. You can withdraw $24,900 with Bank Wire Transfer, but the minimum amount you can request with this payment method is $500.</p>
<p>Safety and Security: Is Wild Casino Legit?</p>
<p>Wild Casino remains one of the safest and transparent casinos you can play at. Thanks to its established name and reputation among the community, it’s easy to find out a lot about the casino even in a regular Google search. We made sure to check whether Wild Casino checks out when it comes to player safety and security. First, Wild Casino is RNG certified, meaning every game outcome you get is completely randomized and therefore fair.</p>
<p>The casino is also a registered business in Panama, giving it an additional layer of credibility, and not least, Wild Casino uses SSL encryption to keep your private data safe. All of this adds up to a well-rounded and safe casino. Player ratings aren’t always glowing, but we have mostly chalked this up to bias, as the overall opinion of Wild Casino is that it’s a fair and safe casino to play on.</p>
<p>Go Mobile with Wild Casino</p>
<p>WildCasino.ag is perfectly designed to accommodate mobile play. The user interface shows all the tell-tale signs that lets you know that the casino is fully available for Android and iOS mobile gameplay. Not least, you have the unique menu tucked away in the top left corner that will load up every time you access WildCasino.ag from your handheld device. From Android smartphones to iPhone, to iPad, you should have no trouble loading up Wild Casino.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>For a quick chat with Wild Casino’s customer support, all you need to do is send an email to [email protected] or, failing that just hop in a chat with live chat. However, to access live chat, you will need to be a registered player at the casino. It may take up to 24 hours for customer service to respond via email, so most players recommend sticking to live chat for urgent matters. The FAQ section is helpful, but it may use some additional information.</p>
<p>Verdict</p>
<p>Writing this Wild Casino review didn’t take long nor was it difficult. The brand has a very straightforward approach and you can register and start playing in a matter of minutes. There are flexible banking options and many great bonuses to pick from. Whether you want to start with the $5,000 welcome package or opt for the $9,000 crypto offer, the choice is yours. With 200+ games, you will definitely find Wild Casino to be your second home.</p>
