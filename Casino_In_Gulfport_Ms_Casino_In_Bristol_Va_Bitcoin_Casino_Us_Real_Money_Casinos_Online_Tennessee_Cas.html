<p>AB Trav och Galopp (ATG) will offer Scout Gaming Group’s daily fantasy sports (DFS) games for the first time. The companies aim to do a preview release before the middle of 2021 followed by a hard launch in time for the beginning of the 2021-2022 seasons of Europe’s leading football leagues.</p>
<p>Daily Fantasy Sports Enter the Swedish Market for the First Time</p>
<p>This is the first time a major gaming operator has introduced Scout Gaming’s DFS product to the Swedish market. Scout Gaming Group is a licensed and regulated provider of daily fantasy sports and betting solutions based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is the first expansion of ATG’s range since Sweden’s revision on gambling regulations and license system introduction in 2019.</p>
<p>Owned by Sweden’s trotting and thoroughbred associations, ATG held exclusivity in the Swedish betting market on racing through December 2018. The partnerhship originally started in 1974.</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to have the privilege of launching our fantasy sports product on ATG.se, thus reaching a wider potential player base than ever before,” said Joakim Renman, Scout Gaming’s chief commercial officer.</p>
<p>He added that ATG has been very quick to expand into new products and it’s no surprise that they are the first to implement the increasingly popular fantasy sports genre.</p>
<p>Scout Gaming Will See an Impact on Revenue in the Second Half of 2021</p>
<p>The partnership is likely to have an intermediate to strong impact on Scout Gaming’s revenue following the first half of the year.</p>
<p>According to Scout Gaming ATG has the largest market share of Sweden’s total gaming market in 2019 with more than 1.3 million customers.</p>
<p>Christian Erlandsson, ATG’s head of sports betting, commented on the partnership, saying: “We try to constantly offer our customers exciting new experiences and are keen to add fantasy sports as, what we hope will be, a key vertical offering for ATG moving forward,”</p>
<p>“We have watched this game format grow in popularity around the world and believe that Swedish customers will also appreciate this exciting product. With our almost 50-year legacy of offering pool games and recent expansion into sports betting we believe that we have primed for a successful rollout of daily fantasy sports to the Swedish sports audience,” he concluded.</p>
