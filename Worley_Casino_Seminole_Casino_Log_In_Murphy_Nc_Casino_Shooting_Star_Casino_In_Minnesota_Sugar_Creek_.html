    <h1>Worley Casino Seminole Casino Log In Murphy Nc Casino Shooting Star Casino In Minnesota Sugar Creek</h1>

<p>Hello, first of all I could only select Puerto rico as the country when submitting the complaint, but Germany is correct.</p>
<p>I permanently self-excluded myself from Moi Casino and their sister casinos/ casinos from the same fire on January 19, 2022. I never reactivated the could. I once asked to have it reopened, but then would have had to answer questions about responsible gaming, which I never did.</p>
<p>The casino claims I've reopened it, but that's a lie and the casino can't prove it! So I should never have played there again.</p>
<p>At the casinos that run under CyScuti Entertainment Limited (DMG Solutions), you are blocked across groups if you do the self-exclusion. This didn't work and so I want a refund from the casinos Yaa Casino, Lyra Casino, Quickslot Casino, Happyspins Casino, Hey Casino. I have to mention that documents were requested from me to make the refund, but the refund never came and the casino didn't bother with it at all. I suspect data theft.</p>
