<p>Bally’s Corporation has announced its third partnership with a North American professional sports league, this time with Major League Baseball (MLB).</p>
<p>Bally’s Becomes MLB’s Approved Gaming Operator</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation, based in Rhode Island, announced Thursday that it has signed a multi-year contract with Major League Baseball (MLB) to become the league’s Approved Gaming Operator.</p>
<p>This is Bally’s third sports betting partnership with a professional sports league in North America, following deals with the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association.</p>
<p>Bally’s will gain access to official MLB league and team branding, logos, and data as part of the deal. MLB assets will be added to the operator’s extensive portfolio and sports betting content offering for baseball fans. This will be shown during live MLB game broadcasts on 19 sports channels in the US, comprising more than half of the league’s franchises. In addition, Bally’s and MLB will collaborate on quality standards to ensure the integrity of MLB games.</p>
<p>Exciting Benefits Ahead of the 2021 Season</p>
<p>Bally’s President and CEO George Papanier stated that the partnership between Bally’s and MLB provides exciting benefits for baseball fans all over the world. With the 2021 baseball season approaching, the company is ecstatic to be able to put Bally’s mark on “America’s national pastime,” he added and looks forward to providing a unique and entertaining sports betting experience.</p>
<p>MLB Executive VP of Gaming and New Business Ventures Kenny Gersh stated that this collaboration will provide another exciting way for MLB customers to connect with baseball just ahead of the season. The MLB’s Opening Day is set for April 1st, with all 30 teams in the US competing throughout the day.</p>
<p>Bally’s Corporation currently operates 11 gaming facilities in seven states, a horse racing track, and 13 authorized off-the-board (OTB) licenses in Colorado. Bally’s will run 15 casinos across 11 states after completing pending acquisitions, including the Tropicana Evansville in Indiana, the MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and the Jumer’s Casino &amp; Hotel in Rock Island, Illinois. The operator has begun construction of a casino in State College, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The gaming provider launched earlier this month its “Bally’s for RVA” campaign to raise awareness for a $650 million casino resort near Richmond, Virginia. Bally’s submitted a proposal for the construction of the property in February.</p>
