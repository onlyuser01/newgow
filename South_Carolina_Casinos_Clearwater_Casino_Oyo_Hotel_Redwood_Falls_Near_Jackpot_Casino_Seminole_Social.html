<p>Wild Diamond Miner Review</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner is an innovative, visually rich, and highly-thematic slot game by Woohoo Games, introduced with 36 paylines, and a whole lot of features that you can choose from.</p>
<p>A distant cousin of Gold Rush Gus, Wild Diamond Miner brings its touch to the grid with a bit of a zig-zag design and helps you plunge into the bowels of the earth in search of precious metals and excellent winning potential.</p>
<p>Equipped with Regular and Walking Wilds, Multipliers, and so much more, your quest for wealth begins on a good footing. Read our full Wild Diamond Miner review to find out more.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Step into the Mine</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner comes with an excellent setting that will really have you believe that you are scavenging across a mine and generously plunging your pickaxe into veins to extract what appears to be precious metal and gems. The design is absolutely stunning, offering you a quick and easy read across the grid, making for a fun and exciting overall experience.</p>
<p>Theme-wise, Wild Diamond Miner has clearly struck gold, and while there is not much of a storyline, you will definitely appreciate the gorgeous graphics. The grid, which is a 3-4-5-4-3 layout, creates an interesting and captivating experience that carries on as you play.</p>
<p>Everything is tied neatly together to build a good first impression for new players who are only getting started. You will get the same attention to detail and visual excellence across both mobile and desktop. Players get to enjoy the nice and clickety sound of symbols coming together to produce a winning combination with lingering visuals to help you keep track of what you have just won in case you miss it.</p>
<p>The backdrop is dynamic, and it helps set off the entire grid and make it even more immersive. Woohoo Games has done a good job of creating a compelling visual look for its game. Everything, from the individual features to the spin of the reels has been cleverly thought out.</p>
<p>For example, you will get a Walking Wild that is designed as a box of dynamite with its wick fizzling away, adding to the thematically captivating experience.</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner Slot: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Alright, so let’s get a crack at the symbols. Just like any regular slot, you will have both low and high-paying ones, each with its specificity and potential payout. The symbols you can expect to find are various precious stones in a multitude of colors along with letters and numbers such as A, K, Q, J, and 10.</p>
<p>Those are the different tier symbols you can get, and three of each will yield different payouts, and the gems clearly being of higher value, making gameplay and thematic sense. Wild Diamond Miner makes sure that they are easy to spot on the grid and will always animate the winning combination in a gold rim that flashes and shines until you have spun the reels again.</p>
<p>There are 36 paylines that can produce a winning outcome and you are free to explore them all. So far as the maximum win per bet goes, you can win 2,500 maximum bet size per winning combination, which is actually pretty decent. The RTP of 96% may not seem like too much at first, but it’s actually well-balanced with all the other features pitching in to make your experience far more worthwhile than you have come to expect.</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner Slot Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>When it comes to sounds and animations, we have pretty much covered this. Woohoo Games’ unique signature style allows the company to stay at the cutting edge of innovation time and again.</p>
<p>The background graphics could be a touch more dynamic if you ask us, but Woohoo is pretty much aligned with a robust standard for the audiovisual crafting of their games.</p>
<p>A really good thing we can probably mention here is that the studio lets you adjust the quality of the graphics, allowing you to run the game flawlessly on almost any connection and device.</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner Slot Gameplay</p>
<p>What of the actual gameplay then? Well, Wild Diamond Miner Slot is actually quite intuitive and easy to play. Players basically have to navigate the user interface which is intuitive enough to use it freely and easily and allows you to place a quick wager and calibrate its size without going to any extraordinary lengths.</p>
<p>You just use the arrows to move the betting limits up and down before you press Spin and see the reels produce a winning or losing combination. Players are very welcome to further use the Auto Play feature which makes it much easier to pre-load a desired number of spins and sit back and watch the mining fun unfold.</p>
<p>A spin takes about five full seconds to complete, and you can play about 12 rounds per minute, although this will depend on how often you win, as there are animations accompanying every win. The nice thing about Wild Diamond Miner is that you can set an infinite number of respins, but we really do not recommend doing this, as it may be unwise.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can choose 10, 25, 50, or 100 free spins rounds and let the game play them through on its own.</p>
<p>Wild Diamond Miner Slot Features</p>
<p>There are several core features to Wild Diamond Miner that will make the experience worthwhile and even more enjoyable. Players are welcome to explore any of those, as they will throughout the course of the game. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Wild – The Wild Symbol is pretty standard in Wild Diamond Miner and will replace any symbol except for Walking Wild, the dynamite-filled chest that will bring around explosive wins across the reels.</p>
<p>Walking Wild – The Walking Wild can be triggered on any of the reels, and it will lead to multipliers, along with an expansion feature, and not least – free rounds! The feature will crawl over the paylines and trigger respins, while also expanding to cover bigger swathes of the grid and ensure that you have winning combinations in place while also benefiting from an increasing multiplier.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Although Wild Diamond Miner may look a little short on features, it centers on some of the most innovative gameplay elements that are available in the industry. We love the Walking Wild feature and appreciate its potential for endless winnings. Although this is a theoretical possibility, the hard reality is that you won’t be able to “stick” the Walking Wilds in an infinite loop. So what? Wild Diamond Miner is a fantastic slot that you should not miss out on!</p>
