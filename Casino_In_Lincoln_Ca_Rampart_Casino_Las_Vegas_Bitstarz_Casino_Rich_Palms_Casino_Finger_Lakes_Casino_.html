    <h1>Casino In Lincoln Ca Rampart Casino Las Vegas Bitstarz Casino Rich Palms Casino Finger Lakes Casino</h1>

<p>I was able to view the game's history (DRAGONS ELEMENT) up until two days ago. Now, it is mysteriously gone. Nobody from customer service informed me about there being no records shown of the game that is a lie . I have screenshots of the conversation with customer service which is already posted above . I had to go under the game's history (DRAGONS ELEMENT) because it does not show on my account transaction.</p>
<p>Did you even read or viewed the screenshots from the begining ??</p>
<p>Where is the software provider's investigation report to support what you are saying?</p>
<p>First off I would not waste everyone's time including my own to lie about a situation like this. 2nd, you have to be signed out to be on fun mode and I would've noticed right away it would've started as a whole new game right? I would've noticed especially the change in the currency I was paying attention to the game because I was constantly winning extra spins and when a game changes to fun mode doesn't it start something like 1,000FUN or 9,999FUN starting a whole new game ?</p>
<p>Just to inform you I was playing the game in the middle of a feature then my phone died (the screenshots from earlier on shows that ) when I went back to my game everything was gone and no feature to resume too but the history was on the game .</p>
<p>How would I have screenshots of time and date ???.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have a screenshot of the from DRAGONS ELEMENT history that show the time I started the game which matches the time I left CASH STREAK and the amount I started with, which matches the amount that I left CASH STREAK . Now the game's history is conveniently gone .</p>
<p>Why are my funds lower than the bet amount if I had left CASH STREAK with enough to make a bet ?</p>
<p>Wouldn't that amount be on there now?</p>
<p>( I did play this game before CASH STREAK the very top of that page is the transaction that I am referring to after leaving CASH STREAK .)</p>
<p>The customer is never right, even with proof . I have not played at all since my phone died that night . I truly enjoy playing at your casino I am just so disappointed how this unfortunate situation turning out.</p>
