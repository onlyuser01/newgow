    <h1>Boomtown Casino Hotel Casino Hotel In Biloxi Ms Blaze Casino Scam How To Play Casino Games Silver Se</h1>

<p>Hello FlyingDutchman83,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for following our policy and for submitting a new complaint on Explosino Casino.</p>
<p>As usually, I would like to clarify a few more thing before we would try to contact the casino to clarify for all readers what happen.</p>
<p>Is the issue same as in your previous complaint - thus you are awaiting your deposit refund to your crypto wallet (as in the previous complaint and casino they confirmed that Neosurf wouldn't be possible) from the casino?</p>
<p>Please also note that even if they are sister casino's, it doesn't mean they are owned or operated by the same group of people, so they also might have other procedures handling complaints.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your answer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
