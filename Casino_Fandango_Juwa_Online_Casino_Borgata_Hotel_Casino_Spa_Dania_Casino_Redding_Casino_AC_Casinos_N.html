<p>“We believe, based on the evidence that we have, that they’ve been able to responsibly manage their casino floors.” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy</p>
<p>Furthermore, Governor Murphy acknowledged that the operators have implemented the required health and safety measures which include spacers, reduced capacity, temperature checks, screening questions, and more.

<p>Keeping in mind this week’s announcement, last week, in light of the growing number of positive COVID-19 cases, Governor Murphy urged municipalities to take action. Rolling out new restrictions, the Governor empowered municipalities allowing them to order curfew on non-essential businesses to reduce the spread of the respiratory disease COVID-19. Furthermore, under the new restrictions, the working hours of indoor services at bars and restaurants were reduced.</p>
<p>Not the Year for a Big Family Gathering for Thanksgiving</p>

Next in line is California with more than 1,080,000 reported cases followed by Florida with 914,000 reported positive COVID-19 cases.</p>
