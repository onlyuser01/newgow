    <h1>Treasure Island Casino Hotel Casinos Like Chumba Casino Pier Breakwater Beach Railroad Pass Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>Stakelogic Live is determined to make the presence of its flagship live casino product, the Chroma Key, felt in more markets. To this end, the provider of cutting-edge live casino technology and games has teamed up with Starcasino, which has become the latest operator to embrace the innovative Chroma Key Studio.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live has long touted the Chroma Key Studio as a major disruptor in live casino gaming, and a solution that empowers operators’ live casino offers beyond their expectations. The studio essentially makes it possible for operators to customize their live dealer games without adding friction to the process and making it a preferred choice for companies that seek to immediately differentiate their own products.</p>
<p>Starcasino will now have its branding featured on all of its tables and games which will give players the opportunity to immerse in the casino’s atmosphere. Stakelogic Live Head of Live Dejan Loncar was appreciative of this opportunity and said that the Chroma Key was indeed an opportunity for casinos to significantly up the ante for their live dealer offerings.</p>
<p>"It provides operators with the chance to project their brand on their live casino offerings and scale accordingly. This allows them to provide a truly unique experience for their players," Loncar explained.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the Chroma Key has been a huge success in the Netherlands already and that its further expansion into the Belgian iGaming market was yet another opportunity to grow and succeed. Starcasino Marketing and Games Stefaan Maene was similarly pleased to see this solution made available to the operator.</p>
<p>Maene confirmed that the company was very happy to utilize the studio’s strong personalization solutions to build a robust and reliable platform for its players who enjoy live casino gaming. Stakelogic has also had a string of successes to report recently, as the studio has continued to expand its footprint.</p>
<p>Recently, Stakelogic launched its slot and live content with Coolbet, another prominent operator focused on both European and international markets. The company also expanded in North America through a link-up with Bally’s, strengthening the company’s live dealer offer. The supplier has also expanded its slot library with the addition of the Book of Jones: Golden Book and Wild Wild Bison.</p>
