<p>From North America, the 2023 Formula 1 is moving to Central Europe. The next stop is Red Bull Ring in Spielberg where the Austrian GP will take place on July 2</p>
<p>Last week, we predicted correctly that Max Verstappen was going to win the race in Canada. Knowing how good he’s been in 2023, it’s only logical to assume he’s gonna win the Austrian Grand Prix as well. Bookies think that as well, which is why his F1 odds aren’t that great, but worry not, we’ve got some interesting Austrian GP picks for you that come with much better value.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen Going for the Record on July 2</p>
<p>Max Verstappen is one of only three drivers who have won the Austrian GP on three occasions. The other two drivers – Jo Siffert and Alain Prost – did it a long time ago. In fact, the Dutchman is the only active driver with three Austrian GP triumphs, meaning that he’s the only one with a chance to get to break the record this Sunday.</p>
<p>That seems like great motivation for the Red Bull Racing driver to give his utmost on July 2. Another reason for that is that he wants to keep on impressing. Verstappen is sitting at the very top of the World Drivers’ Championship standings with 195 points after eight races. That’s 69 points more than second-placed Sergio Perez.</p>
<p>The most impressive fact about Verstappen’s 2023 campaign is that he finished on the podium each time this season, winning six races and finishing second in the other two.</p>
<p>Can Lewis Hamilton Upset the Odds?</p>
<p>Together with Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton is the record-holder for the most Formula 1 titles with seven championships. The last time he won the F1 title was three years ago. Last season, he finished 6th, mainly because of car problems.</p>
<p>In 2023, he’s doing relatively okay. With 102 points, he’s currently sitting in the No. 4 position. Although he hasn’t won a race this season, he’s finished on the podium three times. Two of those podium finishes happened in the previous two events.</p>
<p>2023 Austrian Grand Prix Formula 1 Prediction</p>
<p>It would be crazy not to back Max Verstappen to win on July 2. If he didn’t win, it would be a huge upset. However, if a surprise is going to happen at the Austrian GP of 2023, we think Lewis Hamilton could be the one behind it. Still, a way more plausible scenario is that he’s going to finish in second or third place.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Verstappen to win; Lewis Hamilton to finish in the top 3</p>
