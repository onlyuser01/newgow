<p>Betsson will remain present in the Peruvian topflight football leagues and games, as the group has reaffirmed its commitment to the segment. In an update shared on the company’s website, Betsson said that it will continue to work on expanding the reach and popularity of Peruvian sports and the values that are associated with "responsible gaming and sports entertainment."</p>
<p>Betsson Chief Commercial Officer Ronni Hartvig welcomed this opportunity and said that the latest commitment filled the group and its team with pride. The group embarked on this partnership several years ago, teaming up with the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF) and Liga1 in 2020, becoming the naming sponsor for the topflight league.</p>
<p>This happened a little after the initial agreement was signed, in 2021, and the group will be the naming partner for the next 20 years when a change in the name would be up for debate once again.</p>
<p>Betsson, Hartvig said, was passionate about sports and committed to bolstering fan engagement across the board, something that it can do working closely with the FPF. He confirmed that the company is now looking forward to the kickoff of the new season. FPF Director of Competitions Héctor Lara hailed this opportunity and Betsson as an important partner.</p>
<p>This collaboration with Betsson has allowed the FPF to further elevate the Peruvian football experience for everyone involved, especially the fans, Lara explained. Even now, Betsson and the FPF are working closely to ensure that the new edition of Liga1 is the best to date. This comes in the context of a broader to safe gambling principles by all stakeholders involved, Betsson Group assured.</p>
<p>Latin America has long been a priority for Betsson. The group introduced Nicole Regnier, a prominent sports commentator as its ambassador in Columbia. Similarly, Betsson expanded in Mexico, where the group is hoping to continue strengthening its footprint.</p>
<p>The group also agreed to help AC Milan to achieve better overall engagement with fans of the club in the Latin American region. Betsson Group’s commitment to reducing harmful gambling practices and upholding the best industry standards has made it a regional heavyweight that is one of the most prominent betting names.</p>
<p>In 2023, the company is expected to enact a serious plan for its expansion in Brazil, which is expected to be one of the biggest – if not the biggest – Latin American market.</p>
