    <h1>California Casino Las Vegas Winstar World Casino Photos Casino In Cherokee North Carolina Wetumpka C</h1>

<p>I lost my first 5 deposits here and all be fine but when I won 4512 euro it starts difficult to receive my winnings.</p>
<p>Conquestador casino asked the following:</p>
<p>1st email:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Payslip for June and July 2022</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank Statement showing your salary for June and July 2022</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Ecopayz statement covering July and August 2022</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selfie holding your ID. Kindly make sure the photo is high quality, and that your whole arm holding your ID is visible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2nd:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your last payslip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bank statement where you received your salary. This should be from the 1st day of the month you received your last salary until today</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your EcoPayz statement for the same period as the above bank statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3rd:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you acquire your referrals to the affiliate programme?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often are you paid your commission?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we cannot see your commission being paid on your ecopayz statement, kindly provide a statement for the account where your commission is paid showing all transactions, and all commission payments shown on your Invoice between October 2021 and January 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did you receive commission for only 4 months?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you no longer receive commission under the programme?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4rd:</p>
<p>please provide further context on what happens from the time you meet your referral until you begin to receive a commission from them?</p>
<p>I also asked how often you receive your commission payments, and your answer was 4 times a month in 2021, and once a month in 2022. We calculate this as 13 payments, however, the Binance statement you provided only shows 6 transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we understand that your commission derives from transactions made by 3rd parties. With this in mind, kindly provide us with a statement showing every transaction made by your referrals from which you received a commission, along with a statement from ecoPayz showing your weekly/monthly payments into your bank account, and the bank details they were paid to.</p>
<p>5th:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Screenshot of your "My Bonus" page from September 2021 – August 2022. Please also provide us with the CSV file which can be obtained from this page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screenshot of your "My E-wallets page" for all available wallets. We understand you may need to take a screenshot of each available wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screenshot of your "Tell-A-Friend" page from September 2021 – August 2022 showing your Tell-a-friend earnings month by month. We understand you may need to take a screenshot for each month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screenshot of your "My Payments" page from September 2021 – August 2022 showing all payments made to you month by month. Again, we understand you may need to take a screenshot for each month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6th:</p>
<p>We can also see that you are receiving commission from Aran’s Ecopayz transactions, and we require an explanation of why Aran credited your EcoPayz wallet with €10056.00 on 10/11/2021.</p>
<p>7th:</p>
<p>We are aware that it is possible to request an activity report from Ecopayz which will include transactions over 2 years old.</p>
<p>Lastly, we require 2 further documents from you. Please log in to your Conquestador account, and send us a screenshot of your account page. And also, we require another selfie from you holding a paper showing today's date (07/09/2022) along with the code.</p>
<p>a few emails between the next one</p>
<p>the next request:</p>
<p>With regards to your Bank of Georgia statement, please send us a selfie of you holding the statement that is stamped, while also holding a paper stating today’s date. This must be a crystal clear photo.</p>
<p>another one:</p>
<p>Also, on the 4th August 2022, we noticed you withdrawing €10,000 from your Ecopayz account to another bank account, and require this statement from the 1st of July 2022 until today.</p>
<p>Here I say stop, because this bank account don't relate to my income/money used in Conquestador and also it looks like they never stop asking a new docs again and again.</p>
<p>Conquestador closed my account and confiscate all 4512 euro</p>
