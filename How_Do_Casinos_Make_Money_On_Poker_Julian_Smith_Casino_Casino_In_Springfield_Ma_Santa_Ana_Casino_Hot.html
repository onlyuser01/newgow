    <h1>How Do Casinos Make Money On Poker Julian Smith Casino Casino In Springfield Ma Santa Ana Casino Hot</h1>

<p>Honoré Gaming, the leading supplier of sports betting platform solutions and technology, has launched a new loyalty initiative that is tailored to the needs and expectations of the African market. This is the company’s first VIP and loyalty foray with a dedicated program that is already available to a number of high-profile companies in the region.</p>
<p>Loyalty Program That Remains Accessible to Bettors</p>
<p>The loyalty program comes in tiers and enables players to access better perks by simply unlocking the higher levels. Reward points are earned through simple bet placement on any market that a customer may be interested in. The reward points are awarded regardless of the outcome of the bets. The points can then be used to either redeem them as cash or free bets, Honoré Gaming explained.</p>
<p>Presently, the loyalty program is designed with six levels that are designed with the player in mind. According to the company, at least 20% or 30% of the current player bases in the region are able to unlock one level each month, which makes it a fairly accessible solution for the broader public as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Honoré Gaming has reported that it has already debuted its loyalty program in several jurisdictions, including Chad, Nigeria, and Congo Brazzaville. This loyalty program, the company says, directly correlates with an increase in the number of total bets placed. Honoré estimates that new signees may expect up to a 24% increase in total betting turnover.</p>
<p>Good Tool to Inspire Long-Term Loyalty</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity Honoré Gaming COO Christophe Casanova said: “Operators are always looking for ways to retain players and reward them for their loyalty to their sportsbook or casino. Loyalty schemes have long been a powerful way of doing this, so we wanted to offer such a scheme to operators in African markets.”</p>
<p>He said that the loyalty scheme is built in a way that allows for maximum levels of fun and transparency. The points are easy to accumulate and use on the sportsbook of player choice subsequently.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the program is clear from the early pilot tests, Casanova argued, and he is confident that partner sportsbooks will continue to drive better performance in the long-term by picking the program and helping themselves establish loyalty with their customer bases.</p>
