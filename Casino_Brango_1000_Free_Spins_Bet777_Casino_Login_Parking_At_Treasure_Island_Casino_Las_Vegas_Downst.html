    <h1>Casino Brango 1000 Free Spins Bet777 Casino Login Parking At Treasure Island Casino Las Vegas Downst</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I started to play with 0X.bet and I was lucky with Evolutions games xxxXtreme roulette and Monopoly. On 5th June I made 3 withdrawals of 5K with a total of 15K. A couple of days later I made again 3 withdrawals of 5K. So I was waiting for 30K!! Sunday 11th June, so I had been waiting for 6 days for my first 15K, they refunded the 3 withdrawals of 15 K to my 0x.bet account balance!@#</p>
<p>I asked them why but it was of the withdrawal limits. But instead of cancelling the last 3x5K, they cancelled the first 3x5K (ofcourse). Finally on the 14th of June I was paid 15K. But today, 3 weeks after my 2nd withdrawal, I am still waiting for the other 15K. I have emailed and chat with them, but their answers are vague. I got even a manager whatsapp number. So what were their reactions? The first was that payments were on a first come first served basis. I don't know but 3 weeks between the piles of a financial department sounds rediciouless. Then they they had to check my account ?? Crazy because they had already paid out , so why check my account again? I had provide them with my passport etc so I don't get it. Then, they had to contact their provider Evolution, to check my huge win ?! According to them Evolutions doesn't reply so fast so it will take long to verify my winning. Not a single reaction for days but I was emailing them every day. And every day the same answer, they were "working on this situation". Last Sunday , I send to the same managers whatsappnumber the same question; Do you know allready something about my payout ? The person replied that I had to give my account email, so I typed it. Guess what? The guy answered; "Friend, you don't have a JungliWin casino account, please send me a valid email. " So the 0X.bet managers phone number was passed to the JungliWin casino manager. What a mess. Ofcourse I do understand many things but this is a nightmare. Why don't they pay out? I deposited money even while I was waiting for my second payout. And every time I made a bank deposit I had the chance to roll back my 3x5K withdrawals. Very very very lets say smart. But I didn't and now I have been waiting 3 weeks for my 15 K.</p>
