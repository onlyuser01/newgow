<p>The Dutch Minister for Legal Protection Franc Weerwind has commented on some of the rumored changes to the country’s gambling laws. One rumor that has been swirling around is a mandatory loss limit. In a recent address, Weerwind denied that this is being discussed and said that it was highly unlikely for the government to step into the newly regulated market and ask for such a measure.</p>
<p>Weerwind spoke in the Dutch Parliament and shared his thoughts on a measure that some have seen as a good idea. He was questioned by Michael van Nispen and Mirjam Bikker, two Members of Parliament. The minister cautioned, though, that should this measure ever be passed, it could backfire and force consumers to grow anxious and migrate between platforms. This migration could lead to some consumers ending up with unlicensed operators.</p>
<p>Even though the Netherlands has done a fine job of regulating its gambling industry, the threat of black market operators still lurks. Weerwind’s comments are important as they are diametrically opposed to what René Jansen, the incumbent chairman of the Kansspelautoriteit, suggested in one of his addresses in June.</p>
<p>Weerwind, though, believes that players should be free to set their own limits. The government considered the measure very seriously, but in the end, it was decided that loss limits would not prove an effective way of minimizing gambling-related harm or preventing reckless gambling behavior.</p>
<p>He cautioned that too strict limitations of player behavior could push consumers into unsafe practices. Weerwind similarly cautioned about the chancel of channelization towards the legal gambling market to start falling if the government resorts to over-reaching and restrictive regulation. Weerwind added:</p>
<p>"I will also investigate whether technology has progressed so far that a mode can be found for the provider exceeding playing limits, technically and from a privacy point of view."</p>
<p>The Dutch market has been one of the most recently regulated in Europe. Even though the government and regulators took a fair time figuring out the framework, there seem to still be some potholes that need addressing. Just like in any other market, lawmakers have been considering some restrictive measures, such as loss limits.</p>
<p>However, an evidence-based approach has indicated that limiting consumers usually backfires. Meanwhile, the government enacted a ban on role model advertisement that promotes gambling services and products. The idea behind the ban is to not expose younger people to advertisements that use the image and likeness of people who are considered "role models" for those audiences, and thus compel them to gamble.</p>
