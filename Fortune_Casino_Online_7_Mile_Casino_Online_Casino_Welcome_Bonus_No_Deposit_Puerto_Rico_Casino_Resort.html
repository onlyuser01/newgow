<p>Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning are the betting favorites in their golf match against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady. The match is set to be played May 24 at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida.</p>

<p>The front nine will be four-ball – aka best ball of partners. The back nine will be a modified alternate shot, and that’s when the play of Manning and Brady will become much more of a factor.</p>
<p>When the match between the golfing and quarterback greats was announced last month, Las Vegas oddsmakers opened up their odds with Woods and Manning favored at -150. Now confirmed to be played at Medalist, a course located less than 10 miles away from Woods’ compound on Jupiter Island, the odds are further shortening on the 15-time major winner and his two-time Super Bowl champion partner.</p>
<p>The current odds are Woods/Manning -220, and Mickelson/Brady +170. A winning $100 bet on those odds respectively nets $45.45 and $170. Manning has a handicap index of 6.4, while Brady plays to an 8.1.</p>
<p>The match is being contested for $10 million donated by WarnerMedia, which will be distributed to charities working across multiple areas in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Money earned for on-course side bets will additionally go to charity.</p>
<p>“The Match: Champions for Charity” tees off at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday, May 24.</p>
<p>Champs Battle Coronavirus</p>
<p>Tiger and Phil’s match isn’t the only golf event taking place to fund coronavirus relief efforts. In fact, it’s not even the only one in southeast Florida.</p>
<p>Following his decision to move from the New England Patriots to Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Brady joined the ultra-private Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach, Florida. And that’s the location for this month’s “TaylorMade Driving Relief” skins game between Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson versus Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff.</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 17 at 2 p.m. ET, the four pros will tee it up to raise money for coronavirus relief. UnitedHealth Group has pledged $3 million in support of the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation.</p>
<p>As for the betting, McIlroy and Johnson are the favorites at -220. Fowler and Wolff are the dogs at +190. McIlroy is the No. 1 player in the world, and Johnson No. 5. Fowler is ranked No. 27 and Wolff No. 110.</p>
<p>Safety Precautions</p>
<p>Like every sport in America, the PGA Tour has been sidelined by COVID-19 since The Players Championship was canceled in mid-March. Golf fans have been limited to betting on mini-tours, which have continued to hold tournaments in Arizona.</p>
<p>Golf bettors will certainly be excited to have more familiar names to wager on, even if they are competing in less-competitive atmospheres.</p>
<p>Both of the charitable events will be contested without fans. Slimmed down television coverage crews will also be utilized to practice as much social distancing as possible.</p>
