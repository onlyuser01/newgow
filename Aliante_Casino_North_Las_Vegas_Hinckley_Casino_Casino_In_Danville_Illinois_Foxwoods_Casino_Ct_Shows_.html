    <h1>Aliante Casino North Las Vegas Hinckley Casino Casino In Danville Illinois Foxwoods Casino Ct Shows</h1>

<p>The supplier previously teased the collaboration in a press release in December, part of another partnership with local operator JK Bet, but has now reaffirmed the existing relationship with BetBastet.</p>
<p>BetBastet and Pragmatic Play Thicken Ties in Brazil</p>
<p>This collaboration will enable Pragmatic Play to pursue further growth in the market and consolidate its presence in what it expects to be one of the world’s largest iGaming markets. To this end, Pragmatic Play is launching a number of its product categories, to name Virtual Sports, Live Casino, and Slot.</p>
<p>BetBastet players will have access to a wide array of options to explore on their own time. Among the slot, releases are excellent games such as Candy Stars and Sword of Ares, Gates of Olympus and so many others. Live Casino games such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Mega Wheel will also appear and become available as part of BetBastet’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is also launching its Virtual Sports products, including Force 1. The supplier is happy to tie this partnership knot as it allows it to achieve further commercial success across the board and strive to consolidate its presence in not just Brazil, but the largest Latin American market.</p>
<p>Excellent Opportunity to Grow in Brazil and LatAm</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play VP of LatAm operations, Victor Arias, was pleased with this opportunity and said that the region was “extremely promising” for the company. Pragmatic has had a string of successful market entries in Latin America along with expansions. Commenting on the recent success, Arias said:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be given the opportunity to elevate yet another brand with content from three of our most promising verticals and expect the products to resonate strongly with Brazilian players.</p>
<p>BetBastet representative also welcomed the opportunity to forge a content alliance with the company, arguing that its multi-pronged content portfolio will create further growth opportunities for the operator and allow it to enhance its connection with local customers.</p>
<p>“We expect our engagement metrics and revenues to receive a real boost from this major addition and we couldn’t be happier with the terms of the agreement,” BetBastet said. Meanwhile, Pragmatic Play has made a splash with a number of LatAm operators.</p>
<p>Those include Pentagol in Peru, Aposta Ganha in Brazil, and Liderendeportes.bet in Venezuela, to name just a few of the company’s most recent expansions.</p>
