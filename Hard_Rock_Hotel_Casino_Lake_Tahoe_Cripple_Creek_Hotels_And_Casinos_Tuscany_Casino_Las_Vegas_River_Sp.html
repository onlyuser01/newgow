    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Lake Tahoe Cripple Creek Hotels And Casinos Tuscany Casino Las Vegas River Sp</h1>

<p>Hi good afternoon.</p>
<p>I had my account at the Playpix casino and after a few days of use, I was prevented from placing bets. That was fine, but when I tried to make a withdrawal, I had no success. I completed the KYC check, but even after that, I was unable to withdraw my funds. When I contacted customer service via live chat, I was informed that my withdrawal would not be authorized due to company policies.</p>
<p>I would like to get my 400 Reais credited to my PIX account, which is tied to my CPF. Attached is an image showing the response I received on your site.</p>
