<p>Leading B2B software-as-a-service provider for the gaming industry Game Account Network (GAN) announced Monday a definitive agreement with Seneca Gaming Corporation (SGC) was signed. According to the deal, GAN will supply patrons at Seneca’s casinos on desktop and mobile with Simulated Gaming.</p>

<p>Desktop and Mobile Simulated Gaming Solution</p>
<p>The Simulated Gaming software solution powered by GAN’s software will ensure the business arm of the Seneca Nation of Indians leverage effective marketing, brand building and revenue opportunities across the 3 casino properties it operates: Seneca Niagara Resort &amp; Casino in Niagara Falls, Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo, and Seneca Allegany Resort &amp; Casino in Salamanca.</p>
<p>“GAN’s ability to develop a customized solution from the bottom-up made them the right partner to help elevate our simulated gaming platform.” Kevin Nephew, President &amp; CEO, Seneca Gaming Corporation</p>
<p>Seeking to bring a more robust experience to its players in New York, SGC selected GAN to develop a custom solution as a replacement of its former simulated gaming technology, as well as rebrand its play-for-fun offering of social games accessible from desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have a trusted partner like GAN and look forward to relaunching this exciting play-for-fun experience for our loyal players in the near future.” Kevin Nephew, President &amp; CEO, Seneca Gaming Corporation</p>
<p>Marketing and Customer Services</p>
<p>GAN’s simulated solution will also take charge of providing marketing and customer services, including new client acquisition and retention via a holistic marketing approach, to the new user of the platform.</p>
<p>“This partnership and integration of GAN’s software will allow SGC to develop more meaningful and actionable player insights to drive new marketing and revenue opportunities.” Jeff Berman, CCO, GAN</p>
