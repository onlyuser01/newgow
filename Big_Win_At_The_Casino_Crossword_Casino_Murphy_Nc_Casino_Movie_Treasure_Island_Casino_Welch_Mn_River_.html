<p>Coba Reborn review</p>
<p>Theme and Style</p>
<p>Coba Reborn is a snake-themed online slot game from ELK Studios. The slot is a sequel to the popular Coba hit which was also released by the same developer.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Like many ELK Studios slots, Coba Reborn looks fantastic. The game is set deep in the heart of the jungle , with the mysterious ruins of some sort of snake temple making up the border for the action. It is a striking design, one that instantly grabs attention.</p>
<p>Big win in the Coba Reborn slot</p>
<p>The reels’ symbols consist of a selection of animal-themed artifacts and a Golden Snake face. There are plenty of similarities between the design of this slot and the design of the studio’s popular ‘Gold’ series like Voodoo Gold and Ecuador Gold, with these not being the only similarities between the games.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some nice animations to help bring the action to life, while an intense soundtrack helps to create an atmosphere while you spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Coba Reborn uses a cluster-pay set-up to keep the base game frequently engaging. The slot has seven reels and seven rows, with winning combinations being formed of clusters of five or more.</p>
<p>Whenever a winning cluster is formed, the symbols are removed from the grid, and more will fall into their place. These sequences only stop when no new winning clusters are formed on the grid.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Whenever a win is formed and the aforementioned Avalanche mechanic kicks in, the winning symbols are collected and added to the Snake Progress Meter. When this is half-full, Wild symbols are placed on the grid at random. When it is totally full, three or more Snakes are added to the grid. At levels 1-3, three Snakes are added, with four added when you reach level 4.</p>
<p>Snakes are snake-shaped clusters of symbols that move across the grid and help to form winning clusters. Snakes come in two colors - yellow snakes will survive the next Avalanche, while blue ones might disappear from the grid following the next win.</p>
<p>Snakes can grow in length by moving over a matching symbol as they progress around the grid. If two snakes cross each other, they will create a Multiplier Wild symbol. This can be doubled if another snake crosses it. A Snake will be destroyed if it crosses itself at any point.</p>
<p>One of the bonus features of the game</p>
<p>There are also four special Orchid symbols that a snake can consume as it crosses the reels, each with its own feature.</p>
<p>If there are two or more Blood Orchids on the reels, then Snakes can spawn from them. It is also possible for a Blood Orchid to drain another Orchid to spawn a Snake. If a Snake eats a Blood Orchid, a random number of Snakes will appear on the reels.</p>
<p>When a Snake eats a Hydra Orchid, it will spawn another Snake with the same leading symbol behind it. Any features the Snake possesses will be passed to the new one.</p>
<p>A Rebirth Orchid effectively acts as another life and will help a Snake come back to the reels if it dies.</p>
<p>Finally, the Ouroboros Orchid allows a Snake to cross itself without dying. When this is active, a Snake will form a Multiplier Wild when it crosses itself.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, ELK Studio’s X-iter Bonus Buy feature may be available. This allows you to purchase your way into the bonus rounds for a set fee.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Coba Reborn is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to its math model. The game has an excellent maximum win of 25,000x your stake. It is considered highly volatile, which we view as a positive. Unfortunately, the slot has a below-average RTP of 94%. This will disappoint a lot of players and go against what we suggest in our slot strategy guide.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Coba Reborn slot machine</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Coba Reborn is an upgraded version of the original Coba slot that boasts a stylish design and some innovative bonus features. The snake-themed action is particularly fun and can lead to some good wins when you have a prolonged sequence of action. Unfortunately, a disappointing low RTP lets the slot down considerably and will no doubt detract from the game’s positive features.</p>
