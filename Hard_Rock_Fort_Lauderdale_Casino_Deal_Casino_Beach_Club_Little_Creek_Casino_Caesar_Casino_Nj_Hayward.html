<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us!</p>
<p>As informed by our Accounting team, kindly note that the withdrawal could not be approved and the winnings were voided as per the following terms:</p>
<p>2.5.6. Casino reserves the right to withhold or otherwise decline or reverse any pay-out or winning amount or to amend any policy in the event that there is reasonable suspicion that a User is abusing or attempting to abuse any of the following: (i) bonuses; (ii) other promotions; or (iii) specific policies or rules determined in respect of an existing Game or a new Game. Casino retains the right to determine absolutely that such an abuse has taken place; also, if Your activity in Our Online Casino, by itself, is not abusive, but Your activities in other online casinos in addition to our Online Casino, taken as a whole, constitutes abuse of Our bonuses, promotions, policies or rules.</p>
<p>3.9. Bonuses offered by our casino are intended for genuine recreational players only. Abuse of any bonus offer will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to investigate, cancel, suspend or lock any account if bonus abuse is suspected. At our discretion, all bonuses and subsequent gaming activity may be revoked and voided, and deposits returned.</p>
<p>In this case, the accounting team has identified an attempt to combine winnings from mixed sources, originated in both free bonuses, deposit bonuses, as well as promotion prizes, in order to bypass the maximum cashout rule for free bonuses and promotion prizes.</p>
<p>Kindly note that all of your deposits have been refunded and should currently be reflected in your account.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding in this matter and we are at your full disposal should you need any further information.</p>
