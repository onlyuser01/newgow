<p>Relax Gaming has announced another important addition to its Silver Bullet partnership program, with Jade Rabbit Studio joining the list of content providers for the aggregation platform. Thanks to this cooperation, Jade Rabbit Studio will bring its bespoke and localized games that will be launched with tier-one operators, and accessible to consumers in India, the United States, Latin America, Northern Europe, and Spain, provided that all necessary licenses in each jurisdiction are met.</p>
<p>Relax’s Silver Bullet to Now Deliver Jade Rabbit Studio Games</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit has already an established reputation for building powerful and compelling products that have become a hit with consumers the world over. Jade Rabbit’s reputation is well-deserved as well, as the company focuses on the development of excellent and player-favorite titles such as Let It Slide, Steam Spin, Jambo Cash, Wins of Hermes, but also exotic titles such as Andar Bahar, and others.</p>
<p>Some of its forthcoming games Top Shootout, Joker Loot, La Suerte De La Oca, and more. Jade Rabbit’s addition comes at a time when Relax Gaming has already secured a number of other trusted companies, including Peter &amp; Sons, Blue Guru, and Four Leaf Gaming to name a few. Commenting on this opportunity, Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon welcomed the chance to work with Jade Rabbit and have the company added to the Silver Bullet program.</p>
<p>As Relax Gaming continues to expand globally, it’s essential that we continue to offer our operating partners the most innovative and forward-thinking games on the market. Relax Gaming CEO Simon Hammon</p>
<p>Hammon said that the company was delighted to be joining forces with Jade Rabbit, a company that has had its footprint grow steadily over the past years. Through Silver Bullet, Relax Gaming will offer Jade Rabbit a chance to connect with even more players.</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit Studio’s Tireless Hard Work Pays Off</p>
<p>Jade Rabbit Studio CEO Roger Admeus was similarly excited about the deal and said that the studio had worked tirelessly to make sure that the company brings the best possible iGaming products to market. Through the tie-up with Relax Gaming, Jade Rabbit Studio will have the opportunity to reach bigger audiences as the company continues to push its products forward.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has signed a number of partnerships recently. One of its most recent collaborations was with Thunderkick. Before that, the company teamed up with Livespins, a platform that allows streamers to broadcast slot games and spectators to bet on the outcome of those games while watching.</p>
