<p>The Reds really didn’t need an extra match in the FA Cup, but they will have to play Wolves again after failing to beat them in Liverpool. Just four days after the cup game, Liverpool play Chelsea in the Prem, which is why coach Jurgen Klopp might decide to send a couple of backups to Wolverhampton. The question is whether Wolves’ best XI can beat Liverpool’s B-team?</p>

<p>Wolves to Go All-In in the FA Cup?</p>
<p>Things are looking better for Wolves now that Julen Lopetegui is their coach. However, even he isn’t a wizard who can miraculously get them far away from the relegation zone. Even though their form has started to improve, they still have to work hard to secure another season in the Prem.</p>
<p>They got a very tough schedule ahead – they’re taking on Manchester City in the Prem just a couple of days after the FA Cup duel with Liverpool. Still, they know they’re huge underdogs in that game, which is why they’re probably not too fussed about it.</p>
<p>Instead, rather than thinking about what’s next in the league, they might focus entirely on their next FA Cup match. We think they’re going to play with their best XI against Liverpool on Tuesday, hoping that with the help of their fans, they could knock the favorite out of the competition.</p>
<p>They don’t have a great record against Liverpool with just three wins in the last 15 years. What’s interesting, however, is that two of those wins happened in the FA Cup.</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp to Rest a Couple of Key Men?</p>
<p>We’re almost at the half-point of the 2022-23 season, and Liverpool are sitting outside the top 5. Their goal is to get there before the end of the season, but for that, they will have to start playing much better in the league.</p>
<p>The thing is that the competition is fierce in the EPL this season, especially now that Newcastle are playing such great soccer. Then, there’s Chelsea who are also sitting very low in the standings, but whose ambitions are sky-high. That said, breaking into the top 5 isn’t going to be easy for the Reds unless they give all they got in league games.</p>
<p>But, if they do that, their key men might not be in the right mood to play cup games. That’s why instead of their best XI, the Reds might play with a couple of backups on Tuesday. Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Harvey Elliott, and others are expected to feature in this game. Meanwhile, Klopp might decide to give a rest to superstars like Mo Salah and Cody Gakpo in order to keep them fresh for the EPL duel with Chelsea.</p>
<p>Wolves vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>Wolves love playing the FA Cup, and you can be 100% certain they’re going to give all they got on Tuesday. However, will it be enough to beat mighty Liverpool? We think it might, especially because the game is played at Molineux.</p>
<p>Picks: Wolves to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
