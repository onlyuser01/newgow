<p>The fast-growing distributor of iGaming content for the growing gambling industry, 3 Oaks Gaming, announced a senior-level hire. The company revealed Monday it hired the services of Krasimir Pankovski. The iGaming industry expert joins 3 Oaks Gaming where he will serve as its new Head of Sales.</p>
<p>A statement released by the leading distributor of content reveals that Pankovski is expected to boost the company's expansion and reach more regulated gambling markets around the world. In his new position as Head of Sales, Pankovski will be in charge of the company's commercial growth strategy. He will help identify different growth opportunities for 3 Oaks Gaming in Europe and globally.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by hiring the services of the industry veteran, the company plans to expand its global footprint further and introduce its leading promotional tools and slots for more operators and players around the world. What's more, the senior-level hire further boosts the positive momentum gained by 3 Oaks Gaming.</p>
<p>Pankovski commented saying: "I'm really excited to join 3 Oaks Gaming, and will do my utmost to build on the company's notable growth and take our offering into new territories." Last but not least, he added: "I've been really impressed with the content we have at our disposal and am sure it will grab the attention of more operators and aggregators, as we secure additional licenses and certifications to distribute our products in a multitude of markets."</p>
<p>Overall, Pankovski has more than 15 years of experience within the gambling industry. Before joining 3 Oaks Gaming, he was a part of PokerStars and Entain where he held senior-level roles. Most recently, he was a part of NSUS Group as Global CRM Director for GGPoker.</p>
<p>Hiring an industry expert such as Pankovski comes as no surprise, considering 3 Oaks Gaming's plans to expand its global presence. In fact, only recently, the company boosted its reach via a new deal with EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>The terms of the recent content distribution deal saw EveryMatrix's CasinoEngine platform add leading games from 3 Oaks Gaming. This effectively expanded the reach of the quality content offered by the leading game developer.</p>
