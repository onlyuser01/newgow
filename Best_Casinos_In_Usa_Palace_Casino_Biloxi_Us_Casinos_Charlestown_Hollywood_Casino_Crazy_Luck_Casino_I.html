<p>The governing body of tennis across the globe, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), announced a groundbreaking partnership on Friday. The ITF confirmed it joined forces with the globally recognizable betting and gaming operator, Stake. Under the terms of the freshly minted agreement, the gambling operator was designated as the Official Betting Partner of the Davis Cup. Additionally, Stake was named Official Betting Partner of the Billie Jean King Cup by Gainbridge.</p>
<p>Teaming up with the ITF, the gambling operator joins a growing roster of partners. Currently, the Federation has active deals for the Davis Cup with other recognizable global brands, including Joma and Dunlop, among others. On the other hand, the ITF also has a growing roster of partners that support the Billie Jean King Cup, including its title partner Gainbridge, as well as Microsoft and Magellan.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal, Stake will help deliver exceptional fan experiences. Moreover, the global gambling operator will help promote the two events while promising an engaging experience to tennis fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>Akhil Sarin, Stake's Chief Marketing Officer, revealed in a statement that the company is excited to join forces with the ITF and become an Official Betting Partner for the two competitions. "Tennis is a universally popular sport, and these competitions are two of the most passionately followed across the globe," he added. Finally, Sarin said: "We look forward to some exciting initiatives spread across the tennis calendar and working with the ITF to promote the sport to our worldwide audience."</p>
<p>David Haggerty, ITF's President, was similarly thrilled regarding the new collaboration. He explained that the partnership with Stake builds upon the success of the two competitions achieved last year. Moreover, Haggerty added: "We thank our partners for their continued support, and we look forward to working with Stake, whose track record across a range of major international events speaks for itself."</p>
<p>Finally, ITF's President explained: "Protecting tennis integrity is at the center of all we do and we are pleased to partner with Stake – an organization with a portfolio of high-profile clients, a stated commitment to responsible business practices and significant reach among global sports fans – having conducted rigorous due diligence in line with ITF rules for betting sponsorship, which were developed in consultation with the International Tennis Integrity Agency."</p>
<p>The ITF confirmed that its current data partner, Sportradar, played an important role in the latest deal with Stake. Moreover, the gambling operator has undergone an extensive due diligence process which is in line with ITF's current rules.</p>
