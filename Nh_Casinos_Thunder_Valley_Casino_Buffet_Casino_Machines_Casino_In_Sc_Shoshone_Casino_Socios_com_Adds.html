<p>İstanbul Başakşehir has become the latest Turkish and soccer organization to join Socios.com’s fungible Fan Tokens platform.</p>
<p>Socios Launches the IBFK Token for Better Fan Engagement</p>
<p>Turkish soccer league champion İstanbul Başakşehir has become the latest soccer club from the country to join Socios, a platform that allows sports outfits to launch fan tokens. In this case, ($IBFK) will serve as a way to grant voter rights to fans and seek a deeper integration between athletic teams and sports fans.</p>
<p>Every club that joins Socios.com generates a supply of Fan Tokens, fungible or tradable assets in laymen’s terms. These tokens grant fans rights to participate in club matters, whether it is choosing participating players, strategies and more.</p>
<p>Each club and organization that signs up for Socios.com may only have a limited supply of tokens that is available for distribution, making for an exclusive experience.</p>
<p>Influencing Club Policy and Accessing Special Events</p>
<p>While no stakeholder can single-handedly sway decisions for any organization, the collective bargaining powers of fans could. Fans can participate in in-stadium entertainment decisions, pick the name of a new training facility, and redesign the jersey, request exclusive content and more.</p>
<p>Clubs and organizations, such as İstanbul Başakşehir, also seek to engage fans and boost awareness. For example, you may be invited to various training sessions or get access to important matches, receive signed official jerseys, or just use Fan Tokens as payment.</p>
<p>İstanbul Başakşehir has become the third Turkish team to sign with Socios.com, following in the steps of Galatasaray and Trabzonspor. Socios itself has landed a number of important partnerships legitimizing the platform’s offer.</p>
<p>Today, Socios is partners with FC Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid, AS Roma, and other soccer clubs. The platform has also teamed up with OG, Natus Vincere and Team Heretics, three organizations specializing in competitive video gaming.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy partners include the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and the Professional Fighters League (PFL).</p>
