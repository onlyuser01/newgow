<p>Christine Wechsler, a seasoned industry veteran, will serve as the company’s new SVP of public policy and government affairs</p>
<p>She is joining a team of ambitious individuals who have worked in the sectors of government affairs, public policy, and advocacy for many years, helping shape and spur Scientific Games’ business forward and facilitating growth in establishing the company in new markets.</p>
<p>Bringing In a Well-Versed Legal Veteran</p>
<p>Part of the team’s job is to ensure that it secures partnerships with government-regulated lotteries and assists them in achieving their milestones and operational goals, which reflects positively on Scientific Games’ own operations, and drives them forward.</p>
<p>Wechsler has more than 20 years of experience working in similar environments and she has done various stints at numerous companies, including Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis LLP.</p>
<p>She also served as executive deputy general counsel to the governor in the Pennsylvania Governor’s Office of General Counsel, making her an individual who is well-versed in government and public policy affairs and a strong fit to move forward Scientific Games’ ambitions in these verticals.</p>
<p>She also worked as an assistant district attorney for the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office and served as both assistant chief of the policy and legislation unit and legislative liaison for the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Continues to Steer Towards Further Growth</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Scientific Games EVP of global policy and government affairs Jim Schultz said that the company was dedicated to building and maintaining strong ties to governing bodies, which Scientific Games was ultimately looking to serve. He hailed Wechsler’s arrival and said:</p>
<p>Christine’s understanding of public policy from both the government and business perspectives will help maintain our industry-leading reputation. She brings legislative and advocacy expertise to the team that will help foster further growth in the iLottery space across the country. SG’s Jim Schultz</p>
<p>Scientific Games has been one of the leading lottery companies in the world, providing a wide array of services, including dedicated games, analytics, and technology, and currently operates with 130 customers in 50 countries. The arrival of Wechsler will only strengthen the company’s expertise in pursuing key operational milestones and maintain a strong hand on the rudder as it sails forward to growth and expansion.</p>
