<p>The fast-growing and global gaming operator, Kindred Group plc, announced its plans to expand further into the regulated gambling market in the United States. On Monday, the company confirmed it has secured final approval for its proprietary gaming platform from the gambling regulator in New Jersey, the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE).</p>
<p>The approval marks a major step ahead for the company in its plan to introduce its leading platform to customers in the Garden State. Once this happens, Kindred's customers in the state will benefit from tapping into a platform that is flexible and provides access to better analytics and enhanced customer experience. Given that Kindred has secured this approval, the company confirmed in a statement it anticipates the launch of its platform in New Jersey at some point in May this year.</p>
<p>Henrik Tjärnström, Kindred Group's CEO, shared his excitement by saying: "I am very pleased that we are now able to launch our own Kindred platform in New Jersey, and I am immensely proud of everybody at Kindred who has made this possible." He explained that by launching its platform to customers in New Jersey, the company will deliver engaging and entertaining experiences to new audiences.</p>
<p>Tjärnström added: "We are now finally able to show off our true Unibet product." Finally, Kindred's CEO thanked the gambling regulator in New Jersey for the support and help during the process related to the approval.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that the new platform will deliver efficiencies and acknowledged it will stand out with unique data. Moreover, Kindred pointed out that thanks to the new platform, customers of Unibet in New Jersey will benefit from "an enhanced experience where products and content can be tailored to a greater extent, with wider options and offerings." At the same time, the company stressed that the platform will adhere to the regulations, as well as safer gambling requirements.</p>
<p>After the upcoming launch, planned for May this year, Kindred confirmed that it will continue to improve its platform. Besides New Jersey, the company confirmed it anticipates rolling out its platform for customers in Pennsylvania as well. This entry is expected at some point during the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Recently, Kindred expanded its partnership with Push Gaming. As a result, the company confirmed that a new and exclusive title called Crystal Catcher will be available via Kindred's portfolio. This deal marked an important partnership as it also helped boost the position of Push Gaming within the gambling market in the Netherlands.</p>
