    <h1>Chicago Area Casinos Meadows Racetrack And Casino Remington Park Casino Oklahoma Seminole Hard Rock</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I deposited € 100,00 on my Spinfields account but it was not credited to my account. I deposited another € 100,00 (it was directly credited to my account) and lost that money. I blocked myself after the € 100,00 loss because of gambling issues. But, after the first transaction didn't come back on my bank account it was credited after a few hours to my account that I had just blocked. Now I can login on the website, but can't play anymore or pay my credit because my whole account is blocked. Can you help me? Spinfields doesn't give a reaction.</p>
<p>I sent a lot of emails to SpinFields but no reaction and also the live chat is not reacting. In fact I think that Spinfields doesn't have a live chat option at all...</p>
