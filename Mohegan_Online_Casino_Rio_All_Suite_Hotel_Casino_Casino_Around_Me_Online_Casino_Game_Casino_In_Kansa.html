<p>Nevada ‘Storm Area 51’ Online Oddsmakers Correctly Predict Event Outcome, Organizers Now Planning Music Festival</p>

<p>Online oddsmakers predicted that the “Storm Area 51” raid planned for September 20 wouldn’t actually happen. It appears they were correct, as the more than three million strong Facebook community have been told the happening has transitioned into a music festival at the Little A’Le’Inn motel in Rachel, Nevada.</p>

<p>What started as a social media joke about raiding the highly secretive military base in search of extraterrestrial life quickly morphed into a global phenomenon that garnered curiosity and headlines around the world. The media hype went so far that the US government was forced to respond.</p>
<p>The Nevada Test and Training Range is an area where the Air Force tests and trains combat aircraft. Any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous,” the Air Force said in a statement. And they don’t mean dangerous to them, in case anyone is unclear on the implications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook event organizer Matty Roberts said he was recently visited by the very earthly FBI.</p>
<p>“I was kind of scared, but they were super cool and wanted to make sure that I wasn’t an actual terrorist making pipe bombs in the living room,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Online bookmaker Bovada had offered odds on whether the raid would actually occur, and “No” was the heavy favorite at -350. With event organizers saying the facetious seizure was in jest, the book has removed the line and will pay winners come next month.</p>
<p>Bovada also successfully predicted that President Donald Trump wouldn’t send a warning tweet to those considering participating. “Will President Trump tweet a warning not to raid Area 51?” had “No” at -510. To date, the president hasn’t weighed in on the highly publicized event.</p>
<p>Bovada had correctly forecasted the outcome of “How many people will RSVP ‘Going’ to the event?” as over 1.51 million was the favorite at -250. Two million say they’re going, and another 1.5 million are “interested.”</p>
<p>Celestial Music Festival</p>
<p>Instead of rushing the military compound that features warning signs to trespassers that explain the “use of deadly force is authorized,” Roberts has decided to welcome guests to a nearby outdoor desert music festival in the the middle of nowhere in Nevada that features just one restaurant, no gas station, and limited life-sustaining necessities.</p>
<p>The September festival comes less than a month after this week’s 50th Woodstock anniversary. But while that iconic New York event attracted more than 400,000 people and legendary acts such as the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Who, and Jimi Hendrix (to name a few), Alienstock won’t have the same type of bill.</p>
<p>In fact, with just a little more than a month to go, the webpage for the September 20-22 concert shows only one confirmed act: a band named Wily Savage.</p>
<p>Alienstock is free, but parking and camping spots are going at a premium. A spot for an RV with no hookups is $140, while general parking is $60. A camping spot with a parking space is $130. For those looking for more modern amenites, you’re too late: the Little A’Le’Inn is already sold out.</p>
<p>Festival Turnout Overload Expected</p>
<p>Rachel is the closest town to Area 51, but is still nearly 30 miles north of the military compound. Rachel is also 80 miles north of Las Vegas, meaning the odds are long that the turnout will be substantial.</p>
<p>Little A’Le’Inn owner Connie West told TV station Fox 5 Las Vegas this week that she’s expecting 10,000 people to show up.</p>
<p>“When this first happened I said bring it, I got 30 acres. I’ll put you all there we can camp and everything. Well, now that’s going to become the main event with some parking around it,” she concluded.</p>
