    <h1>Best Slot Machines To Play At The Casino Nolimit Casino Slots Casino Las Vegas Casino Stocks Fortune</h1>

<p>Ended up trying my hand at a no deposit bonus. I made sure that I read all terms regarding the bonus such as amount I had to wager and what games were permitted with the terms of bonus. I got really lucky early on and was actually able to run out the bonus with $140 left. I was super happy to have actually won and request a cash out. Honestly the fact the minimum withdrawal was $100 and the only option was through bank transfer with a $35 fee should of been a red flag that this was not a very honest casino that wants you to ever make a withdrawal, however I was just happy to have won.</p>
<p>I emailed the casino all the documents they required for a cash out they were extremely slow responding to those email let alone approving me I ended up having to send in a different proof of address but eventually was approved. I contacted support by phone and was assured that all I had to do to get the money I won fair and square was make a $25 deposit and wager it once and if I made the deposit in Bitcoin I would then be able to withdraw in Bitcoin avoiding the crazy fees associated with a wire transfer.</p>
<p>It was probably almost a week later when I was financially able to do this. I wagered my $25 deposit at least once and was at $60 extremely excited as I usually have terrible luck. I immediately request cash out of my entire balance this time with Bitcoin. It had been more than a couple days when I became worried after not receiving my winnings considering Bitcoin transfers shouldn't take more than an hour at most once they have been sent.</p>
<p>I then discovered that I was locked out of my account I called support and was informed that due to "negative activity" on my account my account was banned and my winnings forfeited and I would receive a refund for my $25. I asked multiple times what "negative activity" was associated with my account they refused to tell me. Days later I still have not received my $25 I call again, again ask what negative activity was on my account they refuse to tell me assure me my $25 is on its way I tell them this impossible if they already sent the bitcoin there is no way it could possibly take days to make it through the block chain. I'm assured its on the way. A couple days later I call again wanting to know where my $25 is again they say its coming I again ask what "negative activity" is associated with my account they again refuse to tell me. This time I am extremely furious at everything they have put me through and all the headache they caused. I tell them that are obviously a scam and I at least want my $25 even though they scammed me out of a lot more in winnings. I even told them that I was going to make sure everyone knows they are a scam if they didn't make it right.</p>
<p>Several days later I have yet to receive anything from them. This casino truly is a SCAM they will deny you your winnings something to them is just a drop in the bucket but to someone like me means more than anyone knows. We are all struggling terribly during this pandemic and companies like this that prey and steal from the vulnerable make me sick.</p>
