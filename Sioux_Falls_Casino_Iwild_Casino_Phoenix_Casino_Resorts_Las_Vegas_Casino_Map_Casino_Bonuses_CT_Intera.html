    <h1>Sioux Falls Casino Iwild Casino Phoenix Casino Resorts Las Vegas Casino Map Casino Bonuses CT Intera</h1>

<p>Games such as Chilli Fruits, 40 Treasures and Lucky Clover will be available to Italian players</p>
<p>Several days after launching with Favbet in Croatia, CT Interactive further expanded its European footprint thanks to a new agreement with BetFlag. Under the deal, the leading supplier will prove content to the Italian brand, solidifying its presence in the country.</p>
<p>BetFlag ranks among the top 10 most popular casino operators in the country. After more than 10 years in business, the company has grown to be the go-to brand for many Italian players, thanks to its rich selection of casino titles.</p>
<p>BetFlag’s library boasts over 5,000 games. This number will swell further after the injection of CT Interactive content. Under the newly-formed deal, the fast-growing provider will supply the Italian operator with hits, such as Chilli Fruits, 40 Treasures and Lucky Clover, among others.</p>
<p>The agreement with BetFlag comes in the wake of deals with other major suppliers, such as BetMexico in Mexico, Kajot in Slovakia and Sbbet in Montenegro.</p>
<p>CT Interactive’s Content Is Poised to Appeal to Italian Audiences</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new deal with Milena Tsankarska, CT Interactive’s head of business development for the EMEA region, saying that she is thrilled to launch the company’s content with one of Italy’s best operators.</p>
<p>Tsankarska noted that CT Interactive’s rich portfolio is poised to appeal to the Italian players, who are known for their passion for diverse casino content.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why our products are so popular in the region is because Italian players love how diverse, modern, and exciting our products are. Milena Tsankarska, head of business development – EMEA, CT Interactive</p>
<p>CT Interactive’s CRM, Kiril Kirilov, also shared his thoughts, noting that CT Interactive has been steadily growing in Italy. He said that he is proud that so many local operators have opted to onboard his company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Finally, Laviero Saganeiti, Betflag’s casino project manager, expressed his desire to provide customers with high-quality iGaming experiences. He said that his company will meet this goal “thanks to its partners from CT Interactive.”</p>
<p>As attested by numerous recent deals between B2B companies and operators, Italy remains a key market for gambling suppliers that wish to expand their European footprint. A few days ago, Wazdan supplied content to NetBet, following an earlier deal between Gaming Corps and Octavian Lab.</p>
<p>In early July, Spribe, the developer of Aviator, the most popular crash game on the market, launched its industry-leading titles in Italy and Romania.</p>
