<p>To commemorate Women’s Day, DraftKings has pledged to donate $350,000 to non-profit organizations supporting women around the world.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Direct Donation of $150,000 for Women’s Day</p>
<p>Daily fantasy sports and betting operator DraftKings has promised to make a $350,000 donation to organizations in support of female-owned businesses. Along with an initial donation of $150,000, DraftKings will donate a further $10,000 with every 25,000 entries in the pool until the donation reaches $350,000.</p>
<p>The donation is part of the company’s Women’s History Month Sports Popularity Pool project, which aims to celebrate the greatest events and athletes in women’s sports.</p>
<p>DraftKings co-founder, CEO, and chairman of the board, Jason Robins said the company strives to support women both inside and outside of the company.</p>
<p>“We are intentional in our efforts to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging within DraftKings and focused on supporting women entrepreneurs and small business owners to help them launch, build and grow their own companies,” added Robins.</p>
<p>Donation to Benefit Both US and European Non-profit Organizations</p>
<p>One of the organizations to receive the donation is Ladies Who Launch which supports women globally to start their dream companies and businesses. Julie Kikla, executive director at Ladies Who Launch, said the organization was thrilled to see DraftKings’ commitment to supporting women. The donation would assist the organization in growing its education resources and make funding programs more accessible.</p>
<p>The second organization to benefit is the Association of Military Spouse Entrepreneurs (AMSE). According to AMSE co-founders Flossie Hall and Moni Jefferson, spouses of military personnel face one of the highest unemployment rates across the population, and their aim is to lower that rate through educational and entrepreneurial programs. Hall and Jefferson said the donation would allow the AMSE to expand educational and resource programs to support military spouses in developing their businesses.</p>
<p>The third beneficiary is the Bulgarian Fund for Women which is the only native organization to raise funds and provide grants to local NGOs who work to advance women’s rights. Since DraftKings merged with SBTech in 2020, they now have two engineering centers in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play and GGPoker Also Celebrated Women’s Day</p>
<p>Following Pragmatic Play’s $5,900 donation to the Women for Women organization, the company was also a major sponsor of the organization’s Women’s Day celebratory online event.</p>
<p>Julian Jarvis, CEO of Pragmatic Play, said International Women’s Day is one of the most important celebrations in the world and that the company was delighted to show its support for such an incredible organization as Women for Women.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another giant in the industry, GGPoker, donated $10,000 to a women-related cause and held an International Women’s Day Poker Tournament from which $1 of every $10 buy-in went to various non-profit organizations around the world.</p>
