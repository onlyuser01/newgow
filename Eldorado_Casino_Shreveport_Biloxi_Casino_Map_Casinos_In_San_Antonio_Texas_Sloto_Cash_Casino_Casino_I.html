    <h1>Eldorado Casino Shreveport Biloxi Casino Map Casinos In San Antonio Texas Sloto Cash Casino Casino I</h1>

<p>I have to admit that in the future I will no longer play at casinos that you rate as good - because dubious providers always come out. How and on what do you refer your reviews.</p>
<p>Thought this is a reputable casino - registered last Friday, paid 100 euros (100%) bonus, met the turnover requirements - good thing won - then read the terms and conditions - means 48 after verification is paid out but only 500 euros step what already proves that the casino is not fair. No matter on 25.02 ID and address verified- came the message payments will be forwarded- on 27.02 the request that I have to verify all bank statements- you don't know any other way- the lazy excuses and delay tactics- from then I switched to stubborn and none played more cents because I first want to see if I get my money at all (I know and have had experience with reputable casinos that amounts of up to 10k were already on my account within 24 hours) - it doesn't matter since February 25th I've been waiting for any reaction - emails not answered and the live chat always tells the same untruths like yes sorry blah blah blah - do you know everything ðŸ™‚ that shows that this casino is definitely unfair - and money is delayed until you keep playing and lose - have every day with the chat always wrote the excuses themselves - no one answers mails.</p>
<p>verified since 25.02</p>
<p>account verified since 27.02</p>
<p>General terms and conditions are paid out within 2 days - with every crap they refer to the general terms and conditions - strange that they don't do it when paying out -</p>
<p>thank you mike</p>
