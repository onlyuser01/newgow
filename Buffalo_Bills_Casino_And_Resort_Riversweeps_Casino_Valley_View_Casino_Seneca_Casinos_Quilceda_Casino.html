<p>Scout Gaming has made a debut on the US market with the introduction of FanTeam.us, the alter-ego of FanTeam.com and leading European daily fantasy site. Launched in 2015 as a brand, Scout Gaming’s US-facing subsidiary will now make a bold statement in the DFS market as it is arriving in two dozen states, including California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Texas.</p>
<p>Big Launch for European DFS Leader in the US</p>
<p>The press release details that more than 20 states are now available. FanTeam assures that its products operate legally and in line with local jurisdiction prerequisites, making the platform a viable alternative to other established fantasy platforms in the country.</p>
<p>As a result, players from all covered jurisdictions will be able to join various DFS contests and vie for substantial prize pools. FanTeam is proud to bring thousands of possible contests on a monthly basis and feature some of the biggest sports and esports competitions.</p>
<p>FanTeam.us will grant US citizens a direct line to the Scout Gaming Network (SGN), which features over $20 million in annual rewards, with a $1.4 million Premier League contest readily available and the largest such event in Europe.</p>
<p>Big Prize Pools Await Customers in FanTeam</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, Scout Gaming CEO Andreas Ternström said that the company has been methodically increasing its global standing and that it was high time for Scout to pursue an expansion in the United States.</p>
<p>“Since we made the decision last year to increase the effort and focus we are putting on FanTeam, this opportunity has arisen. After DraftKings and FanDuel, we offer the largest prize pools on a global basis. For European sports such as soccer, we are the global market leader.” Scout Gaming CEO Andreas Ternström</p>
<p>The overall expansion of sports betting in the United States has created many new opportunities, among which the entry of proven daily fantasy platforms such as FanTeam. The company will be going up against the established mastodons DraftKings and FanDuel, as well as take on promising underdogs such as PrizePicks.</p>
