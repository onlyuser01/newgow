<p>Daily fantasy sports and betting operator FanDuel entered into a strategic partnership deal with Entercom Communications to become the official sports book partner of the media across its sports broadcast stations and fastest growing digital audio platform, Radio.com.</p>
<p>Further Engagement for Bettors and Listeners</p>
<p>Under the 6-year deal, odds, insights and promotions of FanDuel will find their way to Entercom listeners via the media’s on-air stations and personalities. The strategic partnership unites America’s #1 sports book with the #1 sports audio company in the country with the mission to entertain, engage and inform sports fans across all aspects of the game.</p>
<p>Entercom owns and operates 39 all-sports stations across the US and has an unparalleled portfolio of broadcasts which represents the nation’s leading collection of play-by-play radio coverage, as it reaches to more than 30 million sports fans every month. The radio network also has strong links with 41 professional teams and more than 50 Division 1 collegiate programs.</p>
<p>“Entercom has revolutionized the audio and entertainment industries and we’re beyond excited to be their preferred partner in the sports betting and fantasy categories.” Matthew King, CEO, FanDuel</p>
<p>Fanduel’s CEO further noted that for the two years of mutual business with the media network, it became abundantly clear for the company that the best way to engage with its customers would be through utilizing the authentic connection of Entercom with sports fans.</p>
<p>“We will work together to offer sports fans access to information wherever, whenever, and however they consume content, providing them with the tools to learn and win.” Matthew King, CEO, FanDuel</p>
<p>Deal Sets New Industry Formats</p>
<p>The deal which is setting up entirely new formats for the industry, will allow sports fans of the audio media network to get access to FanDuel’s industry-leading fantasy and sports betting products, risk and trading expertise, via a comprehensive integration across the entire platform, and will involve collaboration between the two parties for content production.</p>
<p>“We believe this is the largest advertising commitment ever made within the radio industry. We are focused on delivering the best sports betting experience for our audiences in markets where legalized sports betting will be pervasive.” David Field, President and CEO, Entercom Communications</p>
<p>FanDuel’s growing popularity and reach across the country makes it the ideal partner for the sports media network to expand on its robust sports platforms and further engage through improved experience for its listeners nationwide.</p>
<p>“The marketplace is growing exponentially and FanDuel is an ideal partner to take full advantage of the influence and reach of Entercom’s robust sports platforms to deliver an even better, audio sports experience to our listeners.” David Field, President and CEO, Entercom Communications</p>
<p>The deal with Entercom Communications continues FanDuel’s close partnership with media platforms and sports broadcasting providers. Midway through October, the sports betting brand owned by Flutter Entertainment signed a deal with Turner Sports to become the exclusive sports book partner for the NBA programming on the media.</p>
