<p>Securing the bid designates Sportradar as the ATP data and streaming rights partner for the next six years starting from 2024</p>
<p>Sportradar Group subsidiary and leading sports technology company offering unique experiences for bettors and sports fans around the globe, Sportradar, secured a major bid for ATP betting, as well as data streaming rights. The company confirmed Monday it secured the multi-year bid for the betting and streaming rights after Tennis Data Innovations (TDI), a joint venture organization of ATP Media and ATP, led an extensive RFP process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new collaboration builds further upon the positive momentum gained by Sportradar. This is because, since 2022, the company was designated as the official secondary data feed supplier of the ATP Tour and Challenger Tour. The aforementioned collaboration helped Sportradar ink multiple deals with sports organizations and companies within the vertical.</p>
<p>The latest RFP bid started back in January and was launched by TDI. Overall, the organization looked into proposals from five bidders for the six-year rights cycle. As a result, Sportradar was selected as the winner of the bid by demonstrating a commitment to innovation and a vision for technology.</p>
<p>At the same time, TDI acknowledged the company’s leading integrity solutions and services as well as its AI-driven technologies. Securing the bid means that starting from January 1, 2024, the company will be the global data and betting streaming rights holder for the ATP. Still, the company explained that in preparation there are still “contractual terms” that need to be finalized.</p>
<p>The Company Is Excited about the Secured Bid</p>
<p>Carsten Koerl, Sportradar’s CEO, said that the company is excited to be selected by TDI for the new bid. At the same time, he pointed out that tennis has seen significant growth recently which once again reaffirms the need for a provider that delivers innovative solutions and products that bring unique experiences for fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>According to Koerl, Sportradar’s products and services are the perfect fit for the new task. Finally, he pointed out: “Our expertise in developing advanced technologies, including computer vision and AI which create advanced analytics and data visualization, will drive new, compelling ways for fans to engage with tennis, while also safeguarding and upholding its integrity.”</p>
<p>David Lampitt, TDI’s CEO, thanked all the companies that participated in the latest bid and went through the RFP process. He added that Sportradar was ultimately selected as the winner of the bid, considering its “combination of product capabilities, global reach and an innovative commercial model.” In conclusion, Lampitt acknowledged the potential and value of ATP content and said that the company is looking forward to the success the new deal with Sportradar will bring.</p>
