    <h1>Casino In Philly Hotel Casinos Near Me Lucky Win Casino Hotels Near Red Hawk Casino Croc S Resort An</h1>

<p>Hello i hope you are doing well. I am contacting you regarding my complaint against Estolio limited who has accepted my bets on posido.com casino after i have told them many times before on their other sister casinos belonging to estolio limited like luckyelektra.com, playzilla.zom, nomini.com, houseofspades.com and other casinos who belong to them and all are under the same company, that i have gambling addiction and i want to be self-excluded permanently for gambling addiction. I did this to protect myself from gambling addiction but i was able to play on posido.com where i lost huge amount of money because of this.</p>
<p>I am contacting you to help me to get refund the net losses that was played on posido.com casino after i have told them numerous times that i wanted to be self-excluded permanently because of gambling addiction from their casinos.</p>
<p>on all of the casinos i have always registered using my bank account with zimpler or trustly and all the data are the same and all payments have gone to them from the same bank account i have. infact even the live chat agents are the same on all of those casinos.</p>
<p>online casinos have social responsibility to protect vulnerable persons from harm or exploitation from gambling but they keep letting me play on their casinos and accept my money even after telling them i have gambling addiction and want to be self-excluded permanently from their casinos. All gambling operators are subject to both regulatory and moral obligations to restrict access to any person that may not be in control of their gambling.</p>
<p>I also found exactly same kind of complaint as mine on casino.guru complaint forums, where a player had self excluded for gambling addiction previously from estolio limited casinos they operate like excitewin.com etc. and was able to play on posido.com. He is also a finnish player just like me and estolio limited refunded his net losses from posido.com so i also deserve to be refunded my net losses on posido.com.</p>
<p>Also i messaged them to give me the reply to these questions and also i asked them to sent all my data that under the GDPR laws i have the right to get if they don't want to just settle the case and refund my net losses which include my transaction history, gameplay history, self-exclusion data, communication logs and the bank statement and the SOW documents because they did that aswell. They never sent me the data i asked for.</p>
<p>I have provided evidence for all of my points and accusations to this complaint and i hope we can finally after 6 months to solve this complaint. I also have many more proofs of self-exclusions under their casinos for gambling addiction and other proofs but unfortunately because of the maximum allowed attachements limit i can't attach all of them at the same time</p>
<p>the total net loss on posido.com: 8318,3e</p>
