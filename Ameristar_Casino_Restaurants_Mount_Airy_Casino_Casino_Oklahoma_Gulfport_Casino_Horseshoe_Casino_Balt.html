<p>Macau’s gross gaming revenues have taken quite a hit. The COVID-19 pandemic and the sporadic resurgence of the virus have devastated the tourism sector in the special administrative region, by extension greatly impacting gambling.</p>
<p>Analysts were somewhat hopeful about the industry’s recovery in the second half of 2022 but sadly, it continued to underperform despite the eased-up pandemic-related restrictions. Morgan Stanley analysts, on the other hand, believe the recovery would be a slow process.</p>
<p>Macau to Top GGR of $22B in 2027</p>
<p>According to recent research by the analytics firm, Macau gaming would top GGR by $22 billion by 2027. This sum would still be lower than the pre-pandemic levels but will signpost the region’s recovery, eventually changing the concession terms.</p>
<p>Macau’s six concessionaires just received their concessions which allow them to operate gambling in the special administrative region for the next decade. Under the terms of the newly-minted concessions, the operators will have to boost their non-gaming spend once Macau GGR reaches the aforementioned mark.</p>
<p>If this happens, Morgan Stanley’s specialists say, some of the biggest operators, such as MGM China and SJM Resorts, will have a lot of weight on their shoulders. The FCFE and EBITDA difficulties will likely be more pronounced for these two companies since the concessionaires’ contributions are not equal.</p>
<p>The Concessionaires Already Have Plans for their Investments</p>
<p>The non-gaming investments are in line with Macau’s vision which sees the concessionaires as companies that should nurture tourism. Therefore, all concessionaires are required to invest in non-gaming and update Macau on their annual plans.</p>
<p>Companies that fail to spend the required investment would be required to invest in more business activities or support public projects chosen by Macau’s government.</p>
<p>The concessionaires have already submitted their plans for the upcoming years. Wynn Macau plans to open a new theater, an art gallery and a theme center. Sands China’s idea, on the other hand, is to invest in dining facilities and a new garden. Meanwhile, MGM China will open a district focused on arts and entertainment.</p>
<p>As for the non-western companies, Galaxy Entertainment will focus on launching a huge 61,000-square-meter hi-tech amusement park and a large museum. The concession holder also hopes to open its 16,000-seat Galaxy Arena. SJM will also invest in museums, planning to open three of them. Lastly, Melco would open a new cinema and a water park. It would also once again host its Dancing Water Show.</p>
<p>These are only parts of the concessionaires’ full plans for the future.</p>
<p>Operators would likely start investing from 2024, Morgan Stanley says. According to its experts, Macau may consider 2023 as a year for recovery, allowing concessionaires to fully focus their efforts on boosting their businesses.</p>
