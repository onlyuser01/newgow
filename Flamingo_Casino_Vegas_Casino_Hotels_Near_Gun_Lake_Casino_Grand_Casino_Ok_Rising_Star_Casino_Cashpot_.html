    <h1>Flamingo Casino Vegas Casino Hotels Near Gun Lake Casino Grand Casino Ok Rising Star Casino Cashpot</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I have a problem with the casino cashpott.</p>
<p>It is about a payout of â‚¬ 1600 which is not paid out.</p>
<p>I just start over from about a month ago, I deposited â‚¬ 50 at this casino and won over â‚¬ 1000 (after feeling the wagering requirements, I was not sure how much I know exactly), but this casino has the following rule (which one apparently used but not mentioned, more later):</p>
<p>a player's accumulated deposit amount does not exceed â‚¬ 200, player will be entitled only up to X10 last deposit. This maximum payout will be enforced also in cases where the player made additional deposits which were deemed at the sole discretion of the Casino to have been made in order to exceed the â‚¬ 200 accumulated deposit amount.</p>
<p>Since I would like to have paid out more than â‚¬ 500, I wrote to live support and asked if I would violate the terms and conditions if I leave my money in the account, make a new deposit, eg â‚¬ 100 and claim a new bonus (wagering 100 + 100 x10)</p>
<p>Implement this and should still be enough to pay over eg 1000 â‚¬ and keep something in the account for future games.</p>
<p>After some time the good lady finally understood what I meant and told myself that I could of course pay out and then play again. Whether the payment works is up to the finance department, but it would be a new payment.</p>
<p>So said done I counted the â‚¬ 100, wagered the required amount and was really lucky so that it was a bit overwhelming and I had â‚¬ 900 paid out (after I had deleted the bonus because this is required when paying out). Then the first attempt to prevent a withdrawal started which was seen as a mistake and the â‚¬ 900 was paid out all well I happy :).</p>
<p>After the money was in my account I had some money in the casino account and turned over and won 1000 â‚¬ but as I like to turn up I thought oh come on pay another 100 so that you can get a nice bonus and see if it is worth it and then.</p>
<p>So I accepted the bonus and after my payment including the new bonus (â‚¬ 100) I had exactly â‚¬ 1077 in my customer account. Since I had already made a successful payout and I was invited to play, I assumed that it would be completely okay as it was the first time. After I had implemented the required 6600 â‚¬ with my 1077 â‚¬, I had a credit which after I deleted the bonus should be a payment of 1600 â‚¬. That was the start of the ordeal.</p>
<p>The payment was rejected on the grounds that I would have received free spins on the money and these would only have brought â‚¬ 7 so I bet too high.</p>
<p>After a complaint it was zero Wagner games and some discussions with the support I got a call in which I was repeatedly apologized and the money was paid out immediately after the weekend. So far so goodâ€¦</p>
<p>About 3 hours later another colleague from the casino called me and told me there was a mistake and that the finance department would have made a mistake with the â‚¬ 900 payout, this should only have been 500 and the rest should have been deleted so profits are mine I made it invalid because it was won with the money of the very first deposit and my deposits in between of â‚¬ 100 each would be retained just like the profit.</p>
<p>On my arguments that I asked several times whether it is okay because I do not want to violate rules + in the meantime a payment took place + was paid in several times and after the first payment a total of over â‚¬ 8000 was implemented and it is clear that I am on the I have been told to leave support statements well that doesn't matter that the management says and I can't do anything about it</p>
<p>When asked what would be with the last 2 deposits, he said 2 things:</p>
<p>1 they don't care</p>
<p>2 they will just keep egg because we have already transferred 900 instead of 500 I could be glad that I can keep the 200 more.</p>
<p>All contact attempts fail due to live support.</p>
<p>I misunderstand my question there? I mean</p>
<p>Eo in their agbs is that? I didn't do anything wrong, I assumed that it was the same as last time and the support said everything is okay.</p>
<p>And how do I know that they made a mistake somewhere? At least I was emailed there that I could play and would get bonuses.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what i can do</p>
<p>Ps for spelling mistakes I apologize my fingers are too big for my phone ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Micha</p>
