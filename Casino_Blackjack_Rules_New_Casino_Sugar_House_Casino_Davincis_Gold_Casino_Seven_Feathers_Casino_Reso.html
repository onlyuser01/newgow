<p>The Duchess of Cambridge, aka informally as Kate, gave birth at 11:01 am local London time. According to the royal family, Prince William was at her side at the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital.</p>
<p>Gamblers in the UK have been placing bets on everything from the sex of the royal baby to his/her name. Monday’s announcement delivered wins to bettors who correctly forecasted a boy on near-even money.</p>
<p>The 10/11 line, or implied odds of 52.38 percent (essentially guaranteeing a win for the house), nets bettors who put $100 on a boy $90.91.</p>
<p>The royal couple’s first child came in 2013 with the birth of Prince George, who is third in line to the British throne. Princess Charlotte was born in 2015, and is fourth in line to be monarch.</p>
<p>Monarchists celebrated the duchess’ third pregnancy, as advocates for the royal tradition favor the “heir and a spare” mentality. Prince William now has two spares.</p>
<p>As with her two previous pregnancies, the duchess reportedly suffered from severe morning sickness, and canceled all official engagements from last fall on.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II, who has held the throne since 1953, celebrated her 92nd birthday on Saturday.</p>
<p>Name Odds Shorten</p>
<p>Kensington Palace was mum on what the new prince’s name might be. But British bookmakers think they have a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>Following the birth announcement of a boy, Ladbrokes slashed odds on male names. Arthur remains the favorite at 2/1, or about a 33 percent chance. A $100 bet and Kensington revealing the baby’s name to be Prince Arthur nets $200.</p>
<p>James is next at 4/1, followed by Albert (6/1), Philip (8/1), and Alexander (10/1). Thomas is going for 16/1, and Frederick at 25/1.</p>
<p>Before a son was confirmed, Alice (8/1), Mary (9/1), and Victoria (11/1) were the female frontrunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the duchess and prince choose, their new son’s official title will read: His Royal Highness, Prince (Name) of Cambridge.</p>
<p>Just Wild About Harry</p>
<p>The British love their royals, and love betting on them, too. Along with the baby bets, Brits have been placing wagers on the forthcoming wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.</p>
<p>Irish bookmaker Paddy Power took bets on when the wedding would take place after the couple announced their engagement last November. Though April was the favorite around 3/1, the date is May 19.</p>
<p>As for where the party-happy Harry will have his bachelor shindig, oddsmakers favor a return trip to Las Vegas at 12/1. The youngest son to the late Princess Diana got into trouble in 2012 he was photographed playing strip billiards in a Wynn Las Vegas suite.</p>
<p>Paddy Power is additionally asking bettors whether they feel Harry and Meghan are having a shotgun wedding. The line of the royal family confirming she’s pregnant during the wedding is at 14/1.</p>
<p>Alexander McQueen is the frontrunner to design Meghan’s dress at 7/1. And for guests, oddsmakers feel there’s little chance President Donald Trump is invited and shows up (50/1).</p>
