    <h1>Virginia Casinos Venetian Casino Las Vegas Caribbean Casino In Kirkland Taxes On Casino Winnings Win</h1>

<p>I requested a payout, March 28,2020 after numerous requests for sensitive personal information; and complying, the payout was manager approved 5/7/2020 and 5/14/2020. I have used the Chat method and email to contact and have been assured each time that the payout was approved. On 5/29/2020; Friday, I was told; per their "rules" and the holiday that it was day 8 of their 10 days to remit. Fast forward to today 6/3/2020 and now I am told that it was paid on May 14, 2020 and now they want access to my bank records to verify that I have not received funds. Of course I have not received funds! Super disappointed, I wish I had read the reviews before I played. Yes I made 5, USD deposits. Shame on them, not worth the trouble. If this saves anyone the trouble, that is sufficient for me.</p>
