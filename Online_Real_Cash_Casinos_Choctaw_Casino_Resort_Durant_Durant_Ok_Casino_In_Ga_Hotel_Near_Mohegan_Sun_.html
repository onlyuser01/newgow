<p>The victims were identified as:</p>
<p>Abigail Tellez-Vargas, 33, of Murrieta</p>
<p>Riese Lenders, 25, of Rancho Palos Verdes</p>
<p>Manuel Vargas-Regalado, 32, of Temecula</p>
<p>Lindsey Gleiche, 31, of Huntington Beach</p>
<p>Alma Razick, 51, of Temecula</p>
<p>Ibrahem Razick, 46, of Temecula</p>
<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration, a 1979 Cessna C550 business jet, which took off from the Atlantic Aviation terminal at Harry Reid around 3:15 a.m., crashed in a field 500 feet north of the French Valley Airport’s runway around 4:15 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>The jet — owned by Prestige Worldwide Flights LLC of Imperial, Calif. — was making its second approach because of heavy fog. The pilot was cleared to land using only instruments.</p>
<p>“The pilot reported to air traffic control that he was going to perform a missed approach, which generally happens when a pilot can’t see the runway environment,” Elliott Simpson, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters.</p>
<p>The jet, which can hold up to 13 people, burst into flames and ignited a brush fire. Nearly one acre of vegetation was scorched before the fire was contained just after 5:30 a.m., the Riverside County Fire Department announced on Twitter.</p>
<p>The six people on board were located and pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p>Saturday morning’s crash comes just four days after one man was killed when his plane crashed after taking off from the same airport.</p>
