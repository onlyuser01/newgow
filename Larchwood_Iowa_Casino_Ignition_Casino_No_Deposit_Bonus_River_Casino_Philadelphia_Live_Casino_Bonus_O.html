    <h1>Larchwood Iowa Casino Ignition Casino No Deposit Bonus River Casino Philadelphia Live Casino Bonus O</h1>

<p>Dear Benjamin,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I have checked general terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://pokerdom.com/en/page/terms:</p>
<p>„By registering at Pokerdom.com, the player confirms that he is not a resident of the United States, Spain, France, Latvia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, Ukraine, the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Ukraine, as well as the Crimean peninsula , Great Britain, Singapore, Denmark, Portugal, Hungary, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Czech Republic, Australia, Slovakia, Belgium and any of the territories legally associated with the above countries. The list of such countries is subject to change by Pokerdom.com without prior notice."</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you haven’t used a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to alter your location, when opening the account? Your confirmation is essential for this case and I’m not asking this to get you in trouble, I’m just trying to understand how the casino handles its own rules. I would like to emphasize that "It is not acceptable to let players gamble if a casino knows that they are from a restricted country" (please check our Fair Gambling Codes for further information https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#restricted-countries).</p>
<p>Lastly, please advise how long ago have you been paid your winnings in the past? I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
