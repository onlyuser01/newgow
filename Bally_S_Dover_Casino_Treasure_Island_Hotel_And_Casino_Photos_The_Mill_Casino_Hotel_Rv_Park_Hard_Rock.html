    <h1>Bally S Dover Casino Treasure Island Hotel And Casino Photos The Mill Casino Hotel Rv Park Hard Rock</h1>

<p>The first image is the screenshot of my ID part being fully verified but awaiting the deposit of bitcoin to complete, that was on the 20th of july.</p>
<p>The second image is a screenshot from Chuck asking me to request a second withdrawal because they cancelled the first request. Then two or three days ago customer service rep on the site told me to cancel the second one and request again thru coindraw for expedited payout. I refused and told them they could cancel that themselves and ill proceed to make a third one. They said they couldn't which was comical coming from them considering the original request was completely cancelled to adjust for deductions then cancelled again due to coindraw issues... I refused to because i knew if i cancelled it myself then the clock gets reset because the fault is on me for doing so (and against Chuck's message asking me not to use coindraw as well)..i make it a point to ask every single day about the withdrawal and receive the same "im sorry we are working on it as fast as we can, itll be 7 days from the 27th..." To which i reply repeatedly they are in error about the date because tthe request originated on the 20th... And show them these same screenshots daily.</p>
<p>Also, in order to activate the free $50 chip as token of apology for taking so long ironically cannot be redeemed, just as with all other bonuses they keep promoting to me including deposit ones, cannot be activated until all pending withdrawals are cleared. Im getting daily, multiple, emails filled with bonuses and promos i cant use at all because they havent gotten to the withdraw getting processed.</p>
<p>Two days ago i had tthis conversation with the customer rep in which he erroneously told me my $1400 is processed and will be in my wallet in minutes because it was meant for another player i said oh you guys processed and handed out 1400 and youre balking at paying out 100 to me? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ SNL couldnt write a more comical skit than this, seriously!</p>
<p>The casino's folks who's been apologetic about the delays are able to send me messages but I'm unable to reach them however their direct customer service support has been nothing but dismissive and patronizing. Id have to go to lengths to prove to them that i did get information from casino saying one thing while they were giving me canned responses like im some idiot whos impatiently expecting the winnings and making up stories to expedite things when clearly the casino has been saying those things but the casino did as evidenced by the screenshots in my complaint...</p>
<p>Now i know realtime gaming okay. If i even as much deposit one dime into the casino whether it be promotional or not i risk losing ALL of the winnings to which they assured me i wouldnt. In fact with cool cats casino and dreams casino not only I lost my winnings but all of my money. Hell, dreams casino cancelled my account altogether. So i aint falling for that shit. RTG clearly states terms of bonus remain in effect until winnings have been withdrawn.</p>
<p>In one of the conversations, i asked what was the hold up? I mean you got payroll check twice at this point and ive been approved on the 20th so why is the "processing" taking much longer than your two paychecks? I told them that makes no sense and thst someone dropped the ball bad but nobody aint picking it up and i dunno where it is otherwise id point you to it already...</p>
<p>Today's fay 19. Almost an entire lunar month if you think about it. For a bitcoin withdrawal. Its not traditional banks in the 20s or even modern day banks either. This is insulting, to be honest, plain and simple.</p>
<p>If youd like i am more than happy to forward you all 18 email transcripts with customer services as well as screenshots of every step of the process</p>
<p>After getting burned by a few RTG casinos, ive learned my lesson and meticulously made sure thst EVERY period and comma, ALL new changes be screenshoted because if they dispute or deny any part of my complaint then they would need to explain the proof that shows they said and did what i said happened.</p>
<p>Its gotten so ridiculous that ive started to avoid brango, extreme, and Yabby because it's starting to feel as if there's more rotten apples in the RTG barrell. Cashing out my winnings shouldnt have to be a long drawn out battle, especially when they're $100 or less AND paid out in crypto...</p>
<p>But seriously ðŸ˜’</p>
<p>Why am i not getting my $100, besides the coindraw maintenance downtime, ive not been given any valid explanation why except for everythings is fine and its processing... See theyre saying (even now on day 19) once its out of queue, i should expect to wait another 7 to 10 days to get paid out. So on day 19 its STIlLL not out of queue which means it will be 27 if not 30 or more days before it shows up in my wallet..</p>
<p>Are you fuckin kidding me? I get my tax return in a fraction of that timeframe and we are talkin about the united states government bureaucracy redtape! Really!</p>
