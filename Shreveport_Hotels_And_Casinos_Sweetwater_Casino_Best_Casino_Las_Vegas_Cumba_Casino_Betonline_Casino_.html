<p>Cash Volt review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>Cash Volt takes the classic iconography of old-style slot machines and transforms it into a retro gameshow scoreboard. The lighting, colour scheme, and arrangement of the various meters and buttons are all designed to evoke shows like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Mastermind. But with added electricity.</p>
<p>The style works pretty well, even though the gameplay mechanics of a slot are wholly different to a gameshow. Somehow those two worlds never stop colliding.</p>
<p>Standard symbols win</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are pretty enough. The background and symbols aren’t complicated, but the artists have rendered them realistically.</p>
<p>The whole thing is animated in a similar manner. Without much in the way of imagination, but plenty of competence on display.</p>
<p>Cash Volt has a funky disco soundtrack with a strong 70s vibe, but updated for the electronic age. The win and spin sounds are a bit basic but they work with the overall tone. The buzzing of electricity as sparks fly is very on theme.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Cash Volt is a five reel slot, with three rows and twenty win lines. So, a pretty standard setup. Nothing too electrifying here so far.</p>
<p>Most of the quirks of gameplay are in the Cash Volt Bonus (details below). It provides enough variety to keep things going at a decent pace.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Cash Volt doesn’t have a Wild symbol or conventional bonuses. It does have a Scatter though.</p>
<p>Six or more Scatters anywhere on the reels pay out a multiple of the player's bet per spin. The more Scatters the player hits, the more they get paid. Six Scatters will win x5 the player's bet, Seven Scatters wins x15. Meanwhile the lucky player that fills all fifteen spots on the reels with Scatter symbols will win x2,500.</p>
<p>There are no free spins, so the Scatter payouts serve as close to bonuses as this game has.</p>
<p>Big win with 8 Scatter symbols</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.71%, a little under our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a bad match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a low RTP is bad news for a slot, and while Cash Volt does a nice job with the visual style, there’s not enough to like about the slot to make up for the 4.29% vig.</p>
<p>The bonuses and gameplay are pretty basic. They are solid, but lack sufficient flare to make up for the downsides of this slot.</p>
<p>We do not recommend Cash Volt highly.</p>
