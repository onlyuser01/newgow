    <h1>Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino Dancing Eagle Casino The Venue At Horseshoe Casino Hot Spring</h1>

<p>I deposited 200 on the 30th July and played quest of the west and got the jackpot 3571.00 I continued to play and also check what my cash withdrawal was on the 1st August I checked and it told me I could withdraw my money my cashbalance was approximately 3200 I withdrew 2700. And was not told I did not have enough money in my account my withdrawal went if you do not have enough cash they usually tell you the balance is too low I just got a message to say withdrawal successful and the funds came out my account. On Tuesday morning when I looked to see if my withdrawal had been processed it said 200 had been transferred then I looked at my balance and 830 had been taken out my account. I queried this and they said I won with my bonus money and because I had withdrawn I voided my winnings that is in incorrect as it said my cash balance was approximately 3200 when I withdrew. There is no way I would have withdrawn funds if I was going to void 3300 to get 200 they answered my first 2 emails but I feel they are just standard answers to fob people off can you please help me the withdrawal was done on the 1st August 7.45am and shows as a real cash withdrawal on my transaction summary thank you</p>
