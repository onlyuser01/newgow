<p>Many people find it difficult when losing a game, regardless of whether they are engaging in friendly play or a tournament. That effect exacerbates even further whenever money is involved, and this is why poker is not for everyone.</p>
<p>While some can keep their “poker face,” emotional players may find it difficult to face a loss. One recent poker battle met professional poker players Nikhil “Nik Airball” Arcot and Matt Berkey at Resorts World in Las Vegas. The $200/$400 game No-Limit Hold’Em game started last month and ended last week. Sadly, one of the players faced not only a seven-figure loss but also engaged in a bit of trash talk. The game was intense and Nik Airball, who is also a Hustler Casino Live regular, made unpleasant remarks against his opponent Berkey.</p>
<p>Overall, it has taken about 10 play sessions and just shy of 60 hours for Berkey to win the heads-up poker match against his rival Nik Airball. The game had a $1 million loss cap which resulted in Airball losing $1,029,700. The seasoned poker pro admitted in a Twitter post that he engaged in negative comments and remarks against Berkey and even called him a “scammer.”</p>
<p>My Statement on the HU Match with @berkey11:</p>
<p>First of all, I want to congratulate Matt Berkey on his victory.</p>
<p>There was a lot of shit talking, most of it for fun and to add excitement to the match, but in the end I have to give credit where credit is due. He played well, and… — Nik Airball (@nikairball) May 9, 2023</p>
<p>Owning up to the negative comments and trash talk, Airball apologized for his behavior toward his opponent. He admitted that he was emotional during the game and regretted calling Berkey a scammer and making negative comments about his business. Additionally, Airball acknowledged that his game with Berkey was fair. He said that his opponent “played well, and he played better than I expected he would.”</p>
<p>“I want to apologize for the comments I made about Matt being a scammer and the negative comments I made about his business. That was out of line and I regret making those comments. I got caught up emotionally in the heat of the moment and said some things I shouldn’t have said, and for that I apologize. Matt showed during this match that he is a true professional,“ reads a statement released via Twitter from Nik Airball</p>
<p>In his recent statement, Airball admitted that he still has a lot to learn as a poker player and acknowledged that he didn’t have a lot of experience in heads-up play. He said that he enjoys poker and likes to show his character which is social, loud and fun. Still, Airball noted: “But I can work on being better at not making comments that can be hurtful.” Finally, the poker pro thanked his fans and people that showed support for his game.</p>
