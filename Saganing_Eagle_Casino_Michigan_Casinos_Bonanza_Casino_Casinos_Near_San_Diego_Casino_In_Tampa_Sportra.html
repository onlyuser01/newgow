<p>Sportradar continues to add to its strong proposition by launching a new virtual NBA product. This new product is part of an existing partnership with the National Basketball Association. Essentially, Sportradar uses its historic data of games to generate 480,000 basketball simulations which amount to 3,000 virtual games a day.</p>

<p>The company has confirmed that it will feature 12 betting markets per contest. Players will also get to enjoy a great quality of the game presentation, with the company leveraging its full technology stack to create realistic motion pictures and simulations.</p>
<p>These are possible thanks to the fact that Sportradar uses hundreds of cameras to collect real-life game input and footage that has been translated to accommodate the new virtual races. Commenting on this, Sportradar released a statement in which it outlined the way the product works:</p>
<p>The fan experience is further enhanced by the high-quality game presentation, where hyper-realistic images have been generated through the latest motion capture technology using hundreds of cameras and sensors. Sportradar</p>

<p>Sportradar managing director for gaming Frank Wenzig has confirmed that virtual sports are an important part of the global betting ecosystem. So far this year alone, more than 200 million tickets have been processed through Sportradarâ€™s products. What this means is that virtual sports can be leveraged to successfully engage with fans. Wenzig had this to add:</p>
<p>Through the introduction of Virtual NBA, featuring the names and logos of NBA teams, Sportradar is providing operators with dynamic new basketball content to drive engagement with the sport and provide fans with access to NBA betting markets, even in the off season.
