<p>The popular provider of games for the iGaming sector, Booming Games, expanded further its European presence after securing a business-to-business (B2B) gaming license from the gambling regulator in Sweden, the Swedish Gambling Authority or Spelinspektionen. The announcement came Tuesday, and it enables the company to continue to provide its engaging content to partner operators in the country.</p>
<p>Securing the license from Spelinspektionen comes ahead of planned changes in the gambling regulation in the country. This July, Sweden will implement new rules for the sector that require the suppliers of content for online gambling operators to have a valid license. The change represents an effort by the gambling regulator in the country to push users to the regulated gambling market and avoid unlicensed operators.</p>
<p>In a statement released via LinkedIn, Booming Games acknowledged that the company is delighted to secure a license from the Swedish Gambling Authority. "This is a significant step for our fast-growing company, and we are excited about the future," explained Booming Games.</p>
<p>Frederik Niehusen, Booming Games' Chief Commercial Officer, was excited about the announcement and pointed out: "We are thrilled to have obtained a full Swedish B2B gaming license, which will allow us to expand our presence in the fast-growing Swedish market."</p>
<p>Moreover, he acknowledged that the company is among the first providers in Sweden to secure a license from Spelinspektionen. Finally, Niehusen said: "This achievement will enable us to build on our existing strengths and further develop our product offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers."</p>
<p>The license from Spelinspektionen enables the company to continue to supply its popular games to customers in Sweden. As a result, players will continue to enjoy games such as Rodfather Megaways, TNT Bonanza, Cash Pig, Burning Classics as well as Buffalo Hold and Win, among other popular titles.</p>
<p>Booming Games' license comes on the heels of other licenses granted by the Swedish gambling watchdog. Last week, Pariplay confirmed it secured a B2B supplier license from the regulator in the country. Similar to Booming Games, the company was allowed to continue to supply its leading content to partners in the country.</p>
<p>Before that, the leading omnichannel game supplier based in the UK, Reflex Gaming, also secured a license from Spelinspektionen. Late last month, the company confirmed it will continue to deliver its popular games to clients in Sweden. At the time of the announcement, Reflex Gaming's CPO, Mat Ingram, said: "We're delighted that players will be able to continue to enjoy our games as we have a fantastic roadmap of content lined up for 2023 and beyond!"</p>
