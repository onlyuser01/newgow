<p>A recent string of huge jackpots left a bunch of Americans richer than they were before they entered the casino</p>
<p>With gambling continuously proving to be a favorite pastime of many Americans, it is hardly surprising that many people do manage to land a jackpot. With that in mind, here are some of the latest lucky players in the US.</p>
<p>Grandfather Reaps Jackpot, Vows to Share It with Grandchildren</p>
<p>An elderly man managed to win a $556,120 jackpot at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, a tribal property operated by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians. On May 25, the player won while playing on a Bonus Times progressive machine at the venue.</p>
<p>According to local media reports, the grandfather hit the jackpot on his second attempt for the day. He spoke with local officials and said that he was bewildered to see three 10s come up.</p>
<p>The man joked that one of the first things to spend the money on is paying the taxes on the jackpot. After that, he plans to buy a new car for one of his granddaughters and fund his other two grandchildren’s college.</p>
<p>PA Man Turns $300-Buy-In into a $1M Payday</p>
<p>During the Memorial Day weekend a few days later, a Pennsylvania man by the name of Pete Mitchell won $936,996 while playing at a casino in South Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Mitchell was playing Ultimate Texas Hold ‘Em at the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel Philadelphia property and decided to go all-in for his last wager. Mitchell’s $300-buy-in turned into a payday of almost a million when he was dealt a Royal Flush</p>
<p>Not only did the player take thousands of dollars home but he also became a part of the casino history since this is the largest progressive jackpot won at the property.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Continues to Consistently Distribute Jackpots</p>
<p>An anonymous player at Caesars Palace was playing Ultimate X video poker when they landed on four aces, effectively landing on a $200,000 jackpot at the same time.</p>
<p>Two days later, another anonymous player won a whopping $2,198,173 by playing a Wheel of Fortune Gold Spin Triple Gold MegaTower machine at ARIA Resort &amp; Casino Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The developer of the gambling terminal, International Game Technology, addressed the matter, saying that the lucky winner has won the jackpot after wagering $7 on the game.</p>
<p>Recently, another Caesars player won a jackpot, this time when playing 88 FORTUNES online. The winner was Stacy M. from Edgewater, New Jersey, who won the $308.914 jackpot.</p>
<p>Speaking of jackpots, IGT smashed its jackpot record in April, distributing $17 million to lucky players.</p>
