<p>Hello, at start of june, i registered on this casino sponsored by twitch streamer. I deposit 250€ in eth. I played bets and slots which with some luck i reach 8000€ balance. At 13 june i request some withdraw for 4000€. Then contacted them to verify my account, they requested some documents, that i sent. Meanwhile i continued playing on their site, mainly casino, and i lost all remaining balance. Today after about 15 days they sent me this:</p>
