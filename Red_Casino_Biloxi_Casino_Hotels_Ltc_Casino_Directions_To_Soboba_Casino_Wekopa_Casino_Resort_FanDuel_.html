    <h1>Red Casino Biloxi Casino Hotels Ltc Casino Directions To Soboba Casino Wekopa Casino Resort FanDuel</h1>

<p>FanDuel officially launched in Arizona last week, with the popular sportsbook bringing its full suite of betting products online. Along with the dedicated sportsbook, FanDuel introduced the horse racing wagering platform TVG.</p>
<p>FanDuel is also bringing a retail experience with the Phoenix Suns’ home arena, Footprint Center, marking a first-of-its-kind partnership where the sportsbook is integrated directly into the sports facility.</p>
<p>The Footprint center sprawls on 7,400 square feet and includes numerous amenities, including a VIP window, 40 HD TV sets, and a 35-foot video wall allowing fans to track the sports action in real-time. In addition, there are 26 self-serving kiosks to avoid congestion during peak hours, and sports fans are always welcome to bet from an app while enjoying a variety of food and beverage options.</p>
<p>During the Thursday Night Football evening last week, FanDuel had various merchandise, food, and special offers all available on-site, with much of that extended to sports fans as complimentary service.</p>
<p>FanDuel put down Arizona as its 11th state in which the company set up shop in an official capacity as a sports betting platform. The company has a ten-year market access deal with the Suns, which it signed earlier this year, and it will also be recognized as the team’s official fantasy partner.</p>
<p>Building a Future for Sports Betting in AZ</p>
<p>FanDuel Group CMO Mike Raffensperger shared his excitement to see the company roll out in another state. Arizona’s fans are some of the most passionate, said Raffensperger, and brought up the landmark partnership between the operator and the Suns.</p>
<p>“Together, FanDuel and the Suns share a mission of delivering absurdly fan-friendly experiences to our customers, and we are excited to offer sports betting in a way that revolutionizes the live experience and brings fans closer to the game,” the executive added.</p>
<p>The Suns’ president and CEO, Jason Rowley, said that the launch was a defining moment for the organization and the State of Arizona. “We’re excited to partner with an innovative leader like FanDuel to bring the FanDuel Sportsbook to Footprint Center along with a multitude of new experiences to all sports fans,” added Rowley.</p>
<p>FanDuel is bringing Casino Cash Trac (CCT) along with it to help with cash management at the sportsbook facility at the Footprint Center. CCT will assist with money-related issues and facilitate the process for FanDuel operations on-site at the arena.</p>
<p>FanDuel is one of many operators to launch in the Canyon State, with DraftKings and WynnBet, among many others, getting an official go-ahead last week.</p>
