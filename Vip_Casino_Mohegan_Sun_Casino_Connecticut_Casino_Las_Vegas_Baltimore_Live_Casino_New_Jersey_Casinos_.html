    <h1>Vip Casino Mohegan Sun Casino Connecticut Casino Las Vegas Baltimore Live Casino New Jersey Casinos</h1>

<p>Hello Matej,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that statement is not correct either. You do not have to have previously identified yourself for information according to Art. 15 GDPR. It is enough if a person is identifiable. The casino itself points this out in its data protection declaration:</p>
<p>According to the GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical , physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>See: https://wildtokyo.net/de/privacy-policy</p>
<p>My person was therefore already identifiable during registration.</p>
<p>It goes on to say, "We collect your personal information when you register an account..."</p>
<p>Regarding the retention period it says:</p>
<p>We keep personal information for as long as we reasonably need it for a legitimate or business purpose. We are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax laws, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When deciding how long to retain information, WildTokyo considers local laws, contractual obligations, and the wants and needs of our customers. If you withdraw your consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy, WildTokyo will stop processing your personal information and the information will be deleted.</p>
<p>Regarding the storage obligations: The company must store data on persons in connection with transactions for five years. This is what the tax and money laundering guidelines say, which also apply in Curacao.</p>
<p>If the company continues to refuse to provide the necessary data, I will lodge a complaint with the responsible authorities, in particular with the AML authority.</p>
