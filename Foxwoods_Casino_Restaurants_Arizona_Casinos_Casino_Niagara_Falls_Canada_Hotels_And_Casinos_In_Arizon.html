<p>Las Vegas is a place where some fortunes are made or broken in an instant. For a segment of the local population, however, it’s also a place where other fortunes are held onto. And those would be the biggest fortunes of them all.</p>
<p>Without spoiling the list too much for you, here are two Las Vegas billionaires who just might be on it. (Image: Raiders.com)</p>
<p>Using the most recent data from Forbes, Casino.org compiled a list of the 10 richest billionaires who reside in Las Vegas for at least part of every year.</p>
<p>By the way, having $1 billion is no longer even enough to get you on this list. So, sorry, David Copperfield and Robert Bigelow, but there are now a staggering 2,640 members of the 10-figure club in the world.</p>

<p>Weili Dai co-founded the semiconductor company Marvell Technology with her husband, Sehat Sutardja, in 1995. Dai was the company’s president until she and Sutardja were fired in 2016 amid an internal accounting investigation. No evidence of fraud was uncovered, however. Since 2017, the couple has resided in Las Vegas, where they invest in real estate and technology. Dai co-founded the AI company MeetKai in 2018. Their net worth has decreased from a high of $1.6 billion in 2021.</p>

Davis is the son of Al Davis, principal owner of the Raiders from 1972 until his 2011 death. Upon the elder Davis’s death, Mark — along with his mother, Carol Davis — inherited ownership of the Raiders with Mark taking over as operating head of the franchise.</p>

<li>Frank Fertitta III</li>

<p>World rank #1104</p>
<p>Frank Fertitta III and his brother, Lorenzo, made the bulk of their fortune through mixed martial arts promoter UFC. The brothers, whose third cousin is fellow billionaire Tilman Fertitta, bought UFC for a measly $2 million in 2001 and sold it to WME-IMG in 2016 for a staggering $4 billion. They sold their remaining stakes in UFC in August 2017 for 5 billion. The Fertittas were raised in Las Vegas after their father, Frank Fertitta Jr., moved there from Texas with his wife in 1960. After Fertitta Jr. retired in 1993, Frank III and Lorenzo led Station Casinos to its IPO, raising $294 million and becoming principal shareholders and co-founders of Station Casinos in the process. Since 2015, Frank has served as CEO of Red Rock Resorts.</p>
