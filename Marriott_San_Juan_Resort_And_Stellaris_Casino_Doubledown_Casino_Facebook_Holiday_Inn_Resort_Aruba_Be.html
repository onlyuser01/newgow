<p>Online casino gaming operator Rootz announced it has received a license to operate online slot games in Germany and become the latest Malta-based gaming operator active in the German market.</p>
<p>Protecting Players and Minors</p>
<p>The license granting Rootz the right to operate online slot games is a recognition of the operator’s willingness to meet the requirements of the State Treaty on Gambling that was passed in the summer of 2021 and helped the federal government and the states establish a framework for nationwide regulation of online casino gaming with a particular focus on the protection of players and minors.</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Rootz chief executive officer Lasse Rantala was happy that the websites operated by the company, wildz.de, wheelzgames.de and spinz.de “meet the requirements of the new State Treaty on Gambling,” announcing that Rootz is ready to launch operations in the German market in the autumn of 2022.</p>
<p>Rootz and its three iGaming brands will approach the online gaming market in Germany with three separate offers in compliance with the requirements for youth and player protection and in line with the technical specifications.</p>
<p>As part of its strategy to affirm its presence in the online gaming industry by attracting the most competent professionals, state-of-the-art systems and programming, as well as continuous innovation, Rootz appointed iGaming expert Sam Brown as its Chief Commercial Officer in June. Brown is expected to spearhead the business into its next phase of growth by leveraging his extensive experience and know-how.</p>
<p>Quality over Quantity</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by experts in iGaming, Malta-based Rootz seeks to provide its players with the best iGaming experience and has been betting on a philosophy of quality over quantity since its inception to build a gaming platform characterized by innovative and efficient programming and featuring powerful graphics and rich content. Rootz introduced its fourth online casino brand, Spinz Casino, more than a year after it had launched its third, Wheelz Casino.</p>
<p>Rootz’s license to operate online casino games in the German market makes it the latest Malta-based iGaming operator with strong ambitions in Germany, following the license granted to SlotMagie, a website operated by Malta-based The Mill Adventure, last month.</p>
<p>Other operators that have already received the green light for operations in Germany include Merkur, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Glücksspiel (DGGS), Tipwin, and Mybet.</p>
