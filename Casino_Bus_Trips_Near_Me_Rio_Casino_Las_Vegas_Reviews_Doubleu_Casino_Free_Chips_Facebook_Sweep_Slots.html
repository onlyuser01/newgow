<p>Back in December 2021, a catastrophic tropical cyclone dubbed Typhoon Odette struck the Philippines. Odette left thousands of residents without a home and access to water or food during Christmas and New Year. But casinos in the country did not hesitate and immediately stepped up to help the victims of the typhoon.</p>
<p>PAGCOR Helps Typhoon Victims with Nearly 20,000 Relief Packs</p>
<p>The government-owned and controlled PAGCOR (Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation) acted immediately by sending some 9,000 relief packs, as well as non-food items to impacted areas such as Bohol, Palawan, the first district of Cebu City, the second district of Surigao del Norte and Puerto Princesa. Moreover, PAGCOR plans to deliver more than 8,000 relief packs to Misamis Oriental, Cebu, Leyte, Southern Leyte as well as Siargao.</p>
<p>“Days after the onslaught of Typhoon Odette, they reached out to us for their disaster relief efforts through their respective charitable arms which we immediately approved.” Andrea D. Domingo, CEO and chairman at PAGCOR</p>
<p>Andrea D. Domingo, PAGCOR’s CEO and chairman, revealed that Clark and Entertainment City casino licensees acted right away to help the residents impacted by the typhoon. She outlined that days after Typhoon Odette’s onslaught, charitable arms contacted PAGCOR with requests for relief efforts. Those requests were immediately approved.</p>
<p>Relief Comes despite the Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic</p>
<p>Additionally, Domingo explained that PAGCOR’s “licensees must establish Foundations which will undertake establishment of health and educational infrastructure, culture development, relief aid and other similar undertakings.” With that in mind, PAGCOR’s CEO acknowledged that in the last two years, the pandemic has significantly impacted many industries, including the gaming industry. Domingo reaffirmed that despite the revenue losses, temporary closures, as well as other limitations, PAGCOR and its casino licensees remain committed to helping Philippine residents.</p>
<p>Besides PAGCOR, other organizations have also joined forces to help victims of the typhoon. Solaire Resorts’ Bloomberry Cultural Foundation Inc. dedicated some PHP50 million ($975,000), which will be used for purchasing relief goods for residents within Mindanao and Visayas regions. What is more, volunteer employees of the Bloombery Cultural Foundation have already helped by distributing some 12,300 relief packs to Siargao Island residents. The volunteers are expected to further help impacted communities within Cebu, Bohol, Palawan, Southern Leyte as well as Misamis Oriental.</p>
<p>In light of the latest COVID-19 wave, the Philippines has limited the operating capacities for casinos in Manila. While lawmakers continue to monitor the situation, the current restrictions are expected to last until January 31, unless extended.</p>
