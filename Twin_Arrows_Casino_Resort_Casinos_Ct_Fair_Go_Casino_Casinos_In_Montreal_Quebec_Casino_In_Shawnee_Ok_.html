<p>Evolution is consolidating its presence in Austria through a new partnership with the Austrian Lotteries brand, win2day, by adding three dedicated live casino tables to the website’s casino offer. As a result, win2day will receive a roulette and two blackjack tables that will all have the latest Evolution technology imbued in them.</p>
<p>From Live Casino Products to Slots</p>
<p>Evolution has an established track record with the Austrian Lotteries and is currently the organization’s only live casino partner. The products made available to Austrian players through this partnership include Lightning Roulette, Immersive Roulette, Infinite Blackjack, and others, excluding the latest additions.</p>
<p>Win2day players are able to access the products on a variety of devices, including desktop and handheld options. Evolution is also working with Austrian Lotteries through the deployment of its award-winning portfolio of slots through Red Tiger and NetEnt, two content arms for the company that it acquired over the past year.</p>
<p>Win2day features games such as Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, Mystery Reels Megaways, Starburst, Fruit Shop Megaways, and others. Commenting on this partnership, Austrian Lotteries product casino games Patrick Kittl said:</p>
<p>“At Austrian Lotteries our philosophy is to act responsibly, to always look to introduce innovation to better entertain our players, and to work in partnership.” Austrian Lotteries product casino games Patrick Kittl</p>
<p>Diverse Gaming Offer for Players</p>
<p>Kittl is confident that the collaboration with Evolution has allowed the company to continue and provide a quality selection of iGaming products for win2day players to experience. The extended partnership was welcomed by Evolution head of business development James Jones who said:</p>
<p>“Win2day offers a fantastic range of classic lottery games, casino games, bingo games, and sports betting opportunities on a single website.” Evolution head of business development James Jones</p>
<p>The new additions to win2day’s selection of games continue to deliver the same level of flexibility and exceptional experience that players have come to expect. The new products are a fresh opportunity to engage with customers as well.</p>
