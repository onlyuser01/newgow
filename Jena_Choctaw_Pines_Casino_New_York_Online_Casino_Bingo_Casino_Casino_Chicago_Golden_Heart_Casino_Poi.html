<p>PointsBet has been up and running for some time in Pennsylvania now and the sportsbook has done well. The company is expanding by adding its igaming portfolio to the already existing in-play and futures betting markets, which will enable players who enjoy online casinos to find one of the top brands now licensed by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and within reach.</p>
<p>PointsBet is building upon its footprint of igaming properties in numerous states, after debuting in West Virginia, New Jersey, and Michigan. This enables the players in the four most forward-thinking states when it comes to igaming in the United States to enjoy PointsBet's select portfolio of igaming titles that will continue growing in the coming months.</p>
<p>PointsBet VP of online casino revenue Aaron O’Sullivan has welcomed the development and noted that the company was excited to make its fourth entry into the igaming market in the United States. The innovative online casino product by PointsBet is a distinct opportunity for the company to connect with new customers, O’Sullivan argued.</p>
<p>"At PointsBet, we pride ourselves with our ability to not only deliver our users with the best-in-class sports betting product but the best-in-class casino content as well – creating a holistic PointsBet user experience," he said in the official press release.</p>
<p>PointsBet has kept its focus on the Keystone State in 2022 from the very beginning. Its subsidiary, PointsBet Pennsylvania, LLC, received a sports betting license from the PGCB. Meanwhile, the company has been able to partner up with two of the best suppliers of igaming products to satisfy its content needs with Evolution and IGT titles now available on the online casino.</p>
<p>This comes in the broader context in which PointsBet operates across the United States. The company is currently present with sports betting options in ten states which makes it one of the most serious players on the market.</p>
<p>PointsBet has definitely been focused on the US betting market. The company entered not so long ago and has been forging important alliances. For one, PointsBet was named an official partner of the National Hockey League. PointsBet remains a formidable player in North America with an increasing presence in the newly-regulated Ontario market in Canada.</p>
