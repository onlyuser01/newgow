    <h1>Seminole Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Hotels Near Hard Rock Casino Tulsa Casinos Cercas De Mi Ny Casin</h1>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I am writing to file a complaint because I have a gambling addiction. I OWN that! This casino certainly didn’t create my problem but I can tell you what has ruined my life.</p>
<p>As I’m struggling with this addiction I asked the casino to close my account because I had a gambling addiction. I’m trying desperately to stop this addiction and help myself that’s why I told him about it I figured it would be closed forever.</p>
<p>Lo and behold you let me open / reopen two additional accounts even though I asked for no option to re-open. I have lost my savings account, my 401(k) and now I’m losing my house.</p>
<p>I hold his casino responsible because you were not following the responsible gaming rules.</p>
<p>I did not change my name, I did not change my date of birth, I did not change my cell phone number, I did not change my physical address, I did not change my Social Security number. You just wanted my money!</p>
<p>I asked one agent for a refund and his response was, Hey we’re not giving you a refund. What an answer!</p>
<p>I would like a refund from the time I was allowed to re-open/open the second account and the third account. Otherwise I am going to the Responsible Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>To be honest I had to write in amount in but I don’t know the exact amount.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Dianne</p>
