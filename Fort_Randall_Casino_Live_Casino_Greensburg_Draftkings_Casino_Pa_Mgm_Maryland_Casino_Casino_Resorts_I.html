<p>Green Bay Looking for the Fifth Straight Win</p>
<p>After a weird start of the season – the 38-3 loss to the Saints – the Green Bay Packers are killing it. Aaron Rodgers and Co. have been in a fantastic run with four straight wins.</p>
<p>Some of those were more impressive than others. For example, the win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 5 wasn’t very impressive. The Packers won 25-22 after overtime, in which we saw both teams missing a field goal. Finally, after more than eight minutes of overtime play, Crosby scored one for the Packers’ fourth win of the season.</p>
<p>This Sunday, the Packers will need to up their offensive game, as they’re taking on a team that’s conceded just 100 points in the past five games.</p>
<p>Still, knowing that their QB has been in a sensational form, the Packers shouldn’t worry much about scoring. Further, Rodgers’ record against the Bears is 20-5 in the regular season.</p>
<p>What they need to be worried about is the defense. They’ve already conceded 122 points so far in the 2021 season. On top of that, some of their key defensive players are struggling with fitness.</p>
<p>In fact, against the Bears, the Packers’ defense will miss two 2020 Pro Bowlers. Linebacker Za’Darius Smith is out since the first game of the season, while cornerback Jaire Alexander will miss his second straight game.</p>
<p>Rushing Problems for the Bears</p>
<p>Two of the Bears’ rushing leaders are out of the game with the Packers. David Montgomery, who has 309 rushing yards to his name, is out with an ankle sprain, while Damien Williams (137 yards) is on the COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>Montgomery was out in Week 5, as well, but rookie Khalil Herbert did a very good job replacing him. We saw him rushing for 75 on 18 carries. Still, there’s a caveat – they played against the Raiders in Week 5, who were horrible in that game.</p>
<p>This Sunday, the Bears are taking on a much better opponent. Without their best running backs, their rushing game is guaranteed to suffer, meaning that all eyes will be on QB Justin Fields and the wide receivers.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Fields might not be 100% fit, following a knee hyperextension against the Raiders last weekend. Although he says he’s fine, there’s a worry that he might not be at his very best.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it’s only logical to assume we’ll see the Packers beating their rivals once again. The big question is whether they can cover the 6-point spread?</p>
<p>The Packers did it in only two games of the season and it seems they could fail to do it again.</p>
<p>Pick: Green Bay Packers to win but not cover the spread; the under should hit.</p>
