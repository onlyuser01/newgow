    <h1>World S Largest Casinos Stream Casino Casino By Yuma Buckys Casino Vegas Hotel Casino Aviator Creato</h1>

<p>Spribe’s new license is good news for Swedish gambling operators, who will be able to continue offering the developer’s great titles to their players</p>
<p>Spribe, a leading developer of gaming titles, has secured a supplier license from Sweden’s gambling regulator, the Spelinspektionen. As a result, players in Sweden will be able to continue playing Aviator, Spribe’s magnum opus.</p>
<p>The move comes in response to the newly-introduced gambling laws in Sweden which state that starting July 1 only licensed suppliers will be able to offer their products to local players. Now that it has secured its future in the country, Spribe will be able to continue offering its engaging titles to Swedish audiences.</p>
<p>Aviator, Spribe’s best game yet, is a simple yet engaging crash title where a plane would ascent into the sky. The higher the plane goes, the more the win multiplier increases. Players can cash out at any time. However, the more they wait, the higher the chance of the plane flying away. If the plane leaves the screen, players who haven’t cashed out lose their wager.</p>
<p>The game’s simple premise, easy-to-learn mechanics and social aspect have proven to be very efficient in attracting Millennial and Gen Z audiences. A live leaderboard and chat functionalities allow players to interact with one another and even compete. In addition, players can get various bonuses from the chat section of the game.</p>
<p>Spribe’s new license is good news for Swedish gambling operators, who will be able to continue offering the developer’s great titles to their players. The supplier’s hits have proven to generate a significant percentage of the GGR of companies that offer Spribe games.</p>
<p>The New License Is a Major Milestone for Spribe</p>
<p>Spribe’s chief executive officer, David Natroshvili, commented on the new license, saying that it is a big milestone for his company. He noted that Aviator remains the undisputed leader when it comes to crash games.</p>
<p>Aviator is the number one crash game in the world, and we are committed to making it available to all players in all markets. Securing our license in Sweden is a major milestone for us as a studio, showing that we can deliver next-generation experiences within the requirements set. David Natroshvili, CEO, Spribe</p>
<p>Natroshvili pointed out that there is a reason why Aviator attracts more than 10 million players each month. He said that his team is looking forward to “seeing it continue to fly high” in the lobbies of Spribe’s partners in Sweden. Natroshvili and the Spribe team are also excited about keeping players at the edge of their seats through Aviator.</p>
<p>In other news, Spribe recently expanded its team with a new appointment, welcoming Giorgi Tsutskiridze as CCO.</p>
