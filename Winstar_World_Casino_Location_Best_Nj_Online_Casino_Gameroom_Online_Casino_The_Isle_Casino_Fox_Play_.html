<p>Blazing Bull 2 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot’s theme borrows from Native American cultural art with an array of magical animals.</p>
<p>Set in a sunny forest, the reels are flanked by ornate totem poles carved with owls, bears, racoons, and deer. The warm expressions of the creatures suggest they are on the player’s side.</p>
<p>The blue sky, mountains, and clouds of the backdrop provide a breathless sense of the outdoors and suggests a western wilderness setting. A bald eagle even occasionally flies overhead to reinforce the rugged American vibe.</p>
<p>Players will face symbols in the form of enchanted animals, with eyes glowing, in their reels. None is more striking than the fiery Blazing Bull himself, though. With a little luck, players will face down their challenge and emerge from the woods victorious.</p>
<p>Mega win in the Blazing Bull 2 slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music is filled with eerie flutes and dramatic drums. This strongly suggests that the player has arrived somewhere mystical. The dark mood of the music feels somewhat at odds with the cheerful sunny day setting, but this is forgivable.</p>
<p>The reels spin with a swishing sound and wins are celebrated with upbeat flute music. Conveniently, players can leave the sound effects of the reels on, while turning off the background music. This is great for players who grow weary of soundtracks, but still want the satisfaction of the win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>The animal symbols each have eyes that seem to glow from within, suggesting they are possessed by some powerful enchantment. Their darker colour palette clashes with the brightness of the forest setting, but does match with the haunting soundtrack.</p>
<p>When players win, the totem poles on either side of the reels light up with patterns of colour. This is satisfying and upholds the magical theme.</p>
<p>Overall, the front end of this game is imaginative and engaging.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Blazing Bull 2 is a six reel, four row slot that uses an any way wins system.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for matching symbols appearing in any position in adjacent rows starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>Players have the option to buy directly into the Bonus features (see below for details).</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Players collect free spins throughout the base game and this progress is noted on meters.</p>
<p>Paytable for Free Spins symbols</p>
<p>When 3 or more Multiplier Wild Bonus symbols or K-Split Bonus symbols appear on the reels, the Free Spins Bonus is triggered.</p>
<p>K-Split Bonus symbols trigger K-Split Free Spins. In each K-Split free spin, a random symbol is selected. The selected symbol will split into either 2 or 3 symbols, increasing the number of possible wins. In addition, the selected symbol pays out on any positions on the reels, not just on consecutive reels from left to right.</p>
<p>Multiplier Wild Bonus symbols trigger Multiplier Wild Free Spins. During these free spins, Wild symbols appear with a multiplier between x1 and x8, which is applied to any win using that Wild.</p>
<p>Extra free spins for at least two Scatter symbols in the free spins feature</p>
<p>During both of the Free Spins features, 2 or more Bonus symbols award additional spins. The greater the number of Bonus symbols, the greater the number of additional spins.</p>
<p>Both Free spins bonuses can be bought as a HyperBonus feature, although the price is quite steep compared to a single spin bet. The HyperBonus feature offers 10 or 15 free spins for K-Spins bonus and 7 or 10 free spins for the Multiplier Wild Bonus.</p>
<p>4 options in the HyperBonus feature</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.26%, a little above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.50 up to a maximum of $/£/€50.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols of the game</p>
<p>As this game is being reviewed prior to release, the volatility data is not yet available. We’ll be watching for more detailed information to determine the compatibility with our recommended strategy. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP Native American culture-themed slot.</p>
<p>With promising strategy stats so far and an engaging front end, this game is well worth a try.</p>
<p>The fantasy of the magical world is fun to get caught up in and the bonus options add an extra twist of flavour.</p>
