    <h1>Aria Resort Casino News Guru Casino Casino Bet Casino Guitar Madison Casino Playtech Supplies Conten</h1>

<p>International gambling technology leader Playtech has made a strategic foray into Georgia and Armenia thanks to a new partnership arrangement with Adjarabet, a local gambling powerhouse.</p>
<p>The new deal will allow Playtech to expand its presence in the region, in line with the company’s pursuit of global expansion. At the same time, it highlights the provider’s commitment to delivering exciting gaming content to fans in multiple countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new partnership will deepen Playtech’s relationship with Flutter Entertainment, which owns a controlling stake in Adjarabet. For reference, Playtech already supplies content to multiple Flutter-owned brands in various regions, including Paddy Power, Betfair, Pokerstars, Fanduel and Skybet, in addition to Adjarabet.</p>
<p>Adjarabet offers a diverse portfolio of gaming products to audiences in Armenia and Georgia. The company’s library of games includes poker, casino titles, sports betting and the Betfair Exchange. Leveraging its natural synergies with Playtech, the operator will be able to also engage fans with cutting-edge live casino games, providing online fans with genuine gaming experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to offering gaming content, Playtech and Adjarabet promised to bolster their responsible gambling protocols and offer gambling in a safe and responsible way.</p>
<p>The deal follows other recent agreements, such as the one between Playtech and Buzz Bingo.</p>
<p>Adjarabet Wants to Solidify Its Position in the Region</p>
<p>Playtech’s chief operating officer, Shimon Akad, commented on the new deal, saying that the new tie-up demonstrates Playtech’s desire to support emerging markets.</p>
<p>We believe this trend will only accelerate – and we look forward to expanding even further globally. Shimon Akad, COO, Playtech</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Avto Oboladze, Adjarabet’s head of online casino, noted that the new partnership agreement will help his company establish itself as a leading gambling operator in the region. Oboladze added that the addition of new games will allow Adjarabet’s fans to experience gaming in a new way.</p>
<p>The integration of Playtech’s content into Adjarabet presents an exhilarating dimension for our valued customers, setting the stage for the partnership’s evolution. Avto Oboladze, head of online casino, Adjarabet</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Adjarabet also secured gaming content from Bragg Gaming, which agreed to inject games from its proprietary Atomic Slot Lab and Indigo Magic studios into the brand.</p>
<p>Playtech, on the other hand, recently inked a new partnership with IDVerse, a world-leading provider of digital ID verification services and software.</p>
