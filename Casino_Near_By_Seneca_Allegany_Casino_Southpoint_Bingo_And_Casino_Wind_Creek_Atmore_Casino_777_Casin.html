    <h1>Casino Near By Seneca Allegany Casino Southpoint Bingo And Casino Wind Creek Atmore Casino 777 Casin</h1>

<p>With its new contract with leading supplier Play’n GO, QTech Games, a powerhouse distributor in Asia and all developed markets, has maintained the growth trajectory for its premium pipeline.</p>
<p>QTech Games Signes Contract with Plan’y GO</p>
<p>QTech Games has grown a dedicated network of online games with Play’n Go’s addition. The company is now able to bring player-favorite titles by the developer to new and existing markets as it continues to sign relevant partnerships with other suppliers.</p>
<p>Recent releases from Play’n GO, such as Rich Wilde and the Amulet of the Dead, the latest in its famous Rich Wilde explorer series, as well as other Arthurian adventures and mythological-themed slots, will be made available to its partners through the contract.</p>
<p>One of Play’n GO’s cornerstone principles is to offer tried-and-true industry products a new makeover, whether it’s through themes, formats, or mechanics. As a result, stunning visuals, immersive soundscapes, and actionable features are effortlessly enhanced by unique maths modeling that allows for deeper engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s games have been optimized for mobile platforms, which is at the heart of QTech’s RNG model, which is built on a fully-owned and customized technological framework that allows game providers and operators to integrate quickly.</p>
<p>Clients benefit from the best performance and customer service available, localized to any area in both emerging and developed markets, thanks to QTech ONE – a progressive network that has cemented its definitive position as a global gaming one-stop-shop.</p>
<p>CCO QTech Games, Ulf Norder, said: “We’re committed to rolling out high-quality content that drives revenue for our partners. So, this deal with Play’n GO consolidates our robust and packed pipeline for 2021.”</p>
<p>Norder continued by stating that only premium games of the highest quality distinguish you from the crowd in today’s industry, so QTech is pleased to see how Play’n GO consistently meets this customer demand, still innovating but never for the sake of innovation.</p>
<p>It’s a subtle distinction that’s reflected in stunning graphics and cutting-edge math models for improved retention and high-variance volatility when needed.</p>
<p>Head of Sales Asia at Play’n GO, Jeffrey Co, stated that the company’s focus isn’t solely in the business of signing content deals. The company is dedicated to its partners, and it strives to always offer them more.</p>
<p>Whether it’s through the robustness of Play’n GO’s networks, which ensure record up-time, the productivity of the distribution team, which simultaneously releases new titles around the globe, or the company’s best-in-class account-management team, Play’n GO devotes all of its energy to ensuring that partners succeed and their players are entertained by the company’s world-class material.</p>
<p>The QTech Network Progressive Jackpot Feature Is Now Available.</p>
<p>QTech Games cemented its position as the leading distributor in developing markets earlier this year with the introduction of Network Progressive Jackpot, an industry-first cross-supplier incentives feature that gives its global partners access to cutting-edge acquisition and retention tools.</p>
<p>The Network Progressive Jackpot is available for 28 Jackpot King Deluxe games from Blueprint Gaming, including Grand (Jackpot King), Major (Regal), and Mini (Jackpot King) (Royal). Jackpots are well-known in the industry as the driving force behind player retention.</p>
<p>The Network Progressive Jackpots are built up from a small percentage of the qualifying bets placed by the players. They are added to an ever-increasing compensation fund. Players would be enticed by the fact that the jackpots are shared among many casinos. The function can be beneficial to both existing and new businesses. They would be expected to have bottomless liquidity if they joined the progressive jackpot pool.</p>
<p>The mission of QTech Games is to provide high-quality content optimization for local delivery to both current and prospective clients. More and more brands are being attracted to the company. QTech also introduces machine-learning tools with winning prompts to its suite of progressive items, in addition to this game-changing functionality. Its goal is to create a framework for digital end-user retention that is genuine, trustworthy, and real.</p>
