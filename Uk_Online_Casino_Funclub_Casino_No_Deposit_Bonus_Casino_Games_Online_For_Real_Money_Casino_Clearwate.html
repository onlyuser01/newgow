    <h1>Uk Online Casino Funclub Casino No Deposit Bonus Casino Games Online For Real Money Casino Clearwate</h1>

<p>The new game is fully customized to suit Caesars’ brand, with the company logo appearing across the table and cards</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has leveraged its content creation platform Playzido to supply bespoke content to Caesars Digital online in Michigan. As a result, the latter company’s Caesars Palace Online Casino and Caesars Sportsbook &amp; Casino brands will now be able to engage fans with an exclusive version of HITSqwad Gaming’s Sweet 16 Blackjack game.</p>
<p>The new game is fully customized to suit Caesars’ brand, with the company logo appearing across the table and cards. The gameplay represents an engaging twist of blackjack where players can place a sweet 16 side bet.</p>
<p>The new partnership comes just after Playzido made a foray into Michigan after securing a B2B license to operate in the state. The deal reflects the Light &amp; Wonder-owned brand’s strategy to develop localized bespoke content for operators and provide them with access to new games through its in-house remote gaming server platform.</p>
<p>The deal is also an opportunity for Light &amp; Wonder to strengthen its ties to Caesars Digital and expand its presence in the United States. Light &amp; Wonder considers Michigan to be an important market and recently launched its new Premium Live Dealer product by Authentic Gaming, with all games delivered from a new studio in the Great Lakes State.</p>
<p>Representatives Lauded the Deal</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new tie-up. Caesars Digital’s vice president of online gaming, Ricardo Cornejo Rivas, praised the new partnership, saying that the provision of tailored content is a key focus of his company.</p>
<p>This branded version of Sweet 16 Blackjack allows our loyal players to enjoy a fun game within a familiar setting, and we are confident Light &amp; Wonder, Playzido and HITSqwad have produced a title that will truly resonate with our audience. Ricardo Cornejo Rivas, VP of online gaming, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>Stuart Banks, Playzido’s founder, also commented on the matter, saying that his team is “extremely proud” to announce the partnership with Caesars. He praised the operator as one of the biggest names in gaming and noted that the partnership will help Playzido extend its market presence in Michigan.</p>
<p>According to Banks, this move is also in line with Playzido’s strategy to empower operators and help them engage fans with branded content.</p>
<p>We very much look forward to working closely with the brilliant team at Caesars Digital and we are super excited about the lineup of games scheduled for release in the upcoming weeks and months. Stuart Banks, founder, Playzido</p>
