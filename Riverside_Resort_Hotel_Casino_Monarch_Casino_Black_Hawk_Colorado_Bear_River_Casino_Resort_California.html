<p>Gambling regulators have been clearly stepping up their game against illegal operations. Some markets, though, have mostly relied on gambling websitesâ€™ goodwill to either seek the operational licenses they need or make a swift exit altogether. However, some operators still need a firm nudge to get the message.</p>
<p>This is why the Malta Gaming Authority or MGA has decided to remind companies that operate without a license in the country to stop doing so at once. In a newly published update, the regulator went after two dozen websites, naming each. One of the names to stand out is that of thepokies.net, which was previously banned by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.</p>
<p>The MGA reminded the entities on the list that they were operating without any license permitting them to do so and urged that they cease all operations at once. While this process is one that could take a while, the regulator has also urged consumers to act proactively and ostracize gambling websites that have not beenoperating under the right licenses in the country.</p>
<p>The MGA reminded that it expects any operator running a business on its territory or targeting Maltese citizens to comply with strict criteria, but in the absence of such cooperation, consumers must avoid those unlicensed websites for their own safety.</p>
<p>Protecting players has been a clear priority for the regulator which launched a consultation last week in a bid to improve consumer standards. This is not going to be done unilaterally but rather involves operators who are able to offer feedback on what solutions could work when seeking to protect consumers and make sure that they remain shielded from pernicious gambling influences.</p>
<p>The illegal gambling market in Malta is actually not that big, owing to the fact that the country has become an iGaming hub with fairly welcoming gambling rules. This means that there are hundreds of companies that are issued an MGA license and can offer their products in a way that makes them easy, safe, and secure for the end consumers.</p>
<p>However, addressing illegal gambling in any of its forms is an important step to ensure that consumers are fully protected. A similar conversation is going on in the United States where the American Gaming Association has urged lawmakers and operators to act more determinedly in seeking to restrict the access of offshore operators to mainland companies.</p>
