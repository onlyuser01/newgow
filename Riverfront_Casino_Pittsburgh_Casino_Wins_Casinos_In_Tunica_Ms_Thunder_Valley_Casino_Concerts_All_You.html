<p>CEO Longmuir said that the partnership will help AvatarUX’s titles and mechanics reach more new players.</p>
<p>AvatarUX, a leading games studio, has signed a global partnership agreement with BetConstruct, a producer of gambling tech and services. Under the deal, BetConstruct will distribute the studio’s industry-leading content.</p>
<p>As a result, BetConstruct will be able to supply AvatarUX’s full portfolio of outstanding hits to its global network of operator partners. Client companies will thus be able to add hits such as CherryPop and TikiPop to their portfolios. A variety of recent releases, including PixiePop and Kitty POPpins will also be available to BetConstruct’s partners.</p>
<p>The new deal will expand AvatarUX’s overall global footprint, helping it reach more operators and players. The studio’s iGaming content boasts innovative mechanics that are sure to engage the audiences of BetConstruct’s partners.</p>
<p>The agreement comes several weeks after AvatarUX signed a partnership deal with Relax Gaming, becoming the company’s latest Silver Bullet partner. Under the agreement, some of the former company’s thrilling titles and engagement mechanics were added to the Silver Bullet platform.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Looking Forward to Working Together</p>
<p>Representatives commented on the new agreement between AvatarUX and BetConstruct. AvatarUX’s chief executive officer, Niki Longmuir, expressed his team’s delight about the tie-up with BetConstruct, which he lauded as “one of the most established and recognizable names” in the industry.</p>
<p>Longmuir said that the partnership will help AvatarUX’s titles and mechanics reach more new players.</p>
<p>The partnership represents a fantastic opportunity for AvatarUX to rapidly grow our portfolio distribution and get our amazing games and mechanics available to new players. We look forward to working closely with the BetConstruct team. Niki Longmuir, CEO, AvatarUX</p>
<p>BetConstruct’s head of gaming, Ruzanna Elchyan, also shared her thoughts on the matter, applauding AvatarUX’s drive for innovation. She said that her team is excited to add the studio’s games to its aggregation portfolio.</p>
<p>With an exciting roadmap ahead and proven concepts, we’re confident AvatarUX will become a must-have provider in any operator’s arsenal. Ruzanna Elchyan, head of gaming, BetConstruct</p>
