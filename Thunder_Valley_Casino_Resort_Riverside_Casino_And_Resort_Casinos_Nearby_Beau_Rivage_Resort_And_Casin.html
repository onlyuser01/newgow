    <h1>Thunder Valley Casino Resort Riverside Casino And Resort Casinos Nearby Beau Rivage Resort And Casin</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I apologize for the extended wait. We haven't encountered such a violation before, which made this matter more complex than it may seem at first glance.</p>
<p>We understand that the Terms and Conditions of any project can be intricate or ambiguously written. We have strived to present all the points as clearly as possible, but sometimes situations arise.</p>
<p>Certain rules might be unclear for clients who aren't familiar with the workings of the casino industry. However, some clauses are unequivocal and can't be misinterpreted by anyone who can read them.</p>
<p>From our end, we've taken all possible steps to prevent clients from inadvertently violating any rules outlined in the Terms &amp; Conditions, and we've been successful in doing so—until this case.</p>
<p>It's a fact that all casinos have varying restrictions on providing their services. Our duty is to limit access to prevent accidents and ensure quality control. Accessing the site from restricted territories is PROHIBITED. Filling out one's profile with accurate information is NOT POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>A client, a full-fledged resident of Latvia, managed to access our site while physically present in Montenegro. During registration, the client entered their personal ID information. However, while completing their profile, they falsely claimed to be a resident of Montenegro, despite actually being a Latvian citizen.</p>
<p>Here's our perspective on this situation: If you're a resident of Latvia or any other country with restricted access, you cannot participate in our casino. This is in compliance with various regulatory bodies that oversee our operations. Even if you're temporarily working in another permissible country, you're still considered a Latvian citizen. And for clarity, the individual in question is not a citizen of Montenegro; they are simply visiting that country temporarily.</p>
<p>On August 23, 2023, the client registered on our platform and made three deposits using Litecoin cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency deposits, by default, lack geographical restrictions, making it impossible to limit their accessibility.</p>
<p>To verify their identity, the client submitted a Latvian citizenship document issued on July 23, 2023.</p>
<p>Upon discovering that a resident of a restricted territory had gained access to our platform, we took prompt action. We immediately blocked account access and refunded all deposits totaling €1900.</p>
<p>Registration, account funding, and placing bets from countries on the prohibited list are strictly forbidden, without exceptions. Nevertheless, we understand that mistakes can happen, and we apologize for the situation that arose.</p>
<p>Our verification process is the final preventive measure to restrict access for clients from countries prohibited for gaming or deposit/withdrawal activities. Due to the circumstances described above, verification became the only means of deciphering clients' citizenship.</p>
<p>Physically limiting the registration of a client from a prohibited country who is not present within that country is impossible.</p>
<p>From our standpoint, when our system requests the "Country" field during registration, it largely implies the country of citizenship for which the client can provide sufficient documentation.</p>
<p>The client accused us of altering the T&amp;C after their victory. We find this peculiar since it's technically impossible; our license oversees this process.</p>
<p>The rule in the T&amp;C is quite straightforward:</p>
<p>Citizens or Residents of the following territories are restricted to use and access pledoo.com by any means including but not limited to: American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, British Indian Ocean Territory, Cayman Islands, Curacao, Great Britain (United Kingdom), Falkland Islands, France, French Guiana, French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Gibraltar, Guam, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Latvia, Martinique, Mayotte, Montserrat, Netherlands, New Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands, Pitcairn, Puerto Rico, Reunion, St. Helena, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts (Christopher) and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Tuvalu, Turks and Caicos Islands, United States of America, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Solomon Islands, Virgin Islands (USA), Wallis and Futuna.</p>
<p>We hope this clarification assists in your decision-making!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Pledoo Team</p>
