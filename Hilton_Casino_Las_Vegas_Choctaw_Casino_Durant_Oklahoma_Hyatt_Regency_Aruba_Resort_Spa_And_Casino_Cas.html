<p>Blueprint Gaming, a developer of slot games, has boosted its Latin American exposure by integrating its products with Salsa Technology, a content aggregator. As a result, Blueprint Gaming will be able to use Salsa’s reach and connections to leverage its products with new customer bases.</p>
<p>Salsa Technology’s partners will be able to benefit from Blueprint’s portfolio of games, featuring popular slot choices, such as Wish Upon a Jackpot, King Kong Cash, and a number of games employing the Megaways mechanic, including Buffalo Rising and Diamond Mine.</p>
<p>Salsa’s network features 35 operators in the Latin American region and delivers on more than 4,000 games from over 60 suppliers, part of which Blueprint is now a part of. Blueprint is building upon its expansion across regulated markets, following a launch in the Netherlands, Europe’s latest licensed market.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Blueprint Gaming director of key accounts Samuel Häggblom simply stated:</p>
<p>“The LatAm region is accelerating at pace and having our games available through Salsa Technology is the perfect way to maximize our reach. Our titles consistently prove to resonate with players across multiple markets and we’re confident that such a strong offering is going to be extremely well-received by the region’s operators.” Blueprint Gaming director of key accounts Samuel Häggblom</p>
<p>Salsa Technology COO Alberto Alfieri said that it was vital for the company to continue building upon its portfolio of developers. This includes successful brands as Blueprint Gaming, Alfieri explained. Through the addition of new operators, Salsa Technology stays relevant with existing partners and continues to grow its portfolio in Latin America.</p>
<p>Blueprint has debuted a number of successful games over the last months. The company introduced a Rick &amp; Morty-inspired slot game by the name of Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, inspired by the catchphrase used by the series’ protagonist.</p>
<p>Previously, the company signed partnerships with Softswiss and the online casino platform Rootz. In 2021, the company has released a number of games, including King of the West, Eye of Horus Megaways, Crypto of the Dead, Fishin Frenzy Megaways, and others.</p>
<p>Salsa’s own growth has been bolstered by the appointment of Alfieri who joined the company in March and has been spearheading its growth potential.</p>
