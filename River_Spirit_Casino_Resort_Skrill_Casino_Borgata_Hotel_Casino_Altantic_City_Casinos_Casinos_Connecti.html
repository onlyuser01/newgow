<p>Jason Guyot has been appointed as the new president and chief executive officer of Foxwoods Resort Casino. Foxwoods Casino reopened after months of lockdown and hardships and came up on top, winning the USA Today’s 10 Best Readers’ Choice Awards.</p>
<p>Jason Guyot Steps in as new Foxwoods CEO</p>
<p>After acting as interim chief executive since April 2020, Jason Guyot has now assumed the full-time duties of president and chief executive officer of Foxwoods Resort Casino, Connecticut, run by the Pequot Tribal Nation.</p>
<p>Guyot, already the first Foxwoods chief executive member to serve in the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, took over the post last year, after nine months in office, and he was senior vice president of resort operations before that.</p>
<p>The tribe said Guyot played an essential role in leading Foxwoods through the Covid -19 pandemic, which resulted in one of their most difficult and exhausting years. Last year resulted in a 31.6% net revenue drop for casinos in the state of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation Rodney Butler had this to say: “What Jason has done over the past twelve months has been remarkable, taking the helm of Foxwoods at the onset of the pandemic, building safety guidelines from the ground up to ensure guests feel safe, and championing a new kind of culture for our team members.”</p>
<p>Guyot expressed his feelings on the matter, stating his passion for the industry and desire to continue and be a part of the growth and prosperity of Foxwoods Resort Casino. He firmly stated that he would continue to be personally invested in the company and all of the employees and tribal members.</p>
<p>Foxwoods Impressive Achievements</p>
<p>Foxwoods had a rough year because of the pandemic. In 2020, the company had to shut down for two and a half months. The company had to furlough 2,000 employees, but it managed to reopen and was quick to bring workers back. The company reopened the El San Juan Casino in Puerto Rico in late January, marking a continued recovery from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Having not stopped there, the Foxwoods Resort Casino of Mashantucket won the USA Today’s 10 Best Readers’ Choice Awards and was voted the country’s best casino outside of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Foxwoods property has been reviewed by C. Douglas Dreisbach, Lisa Robert-Driedzic, and Steve Bourie, who found the casino to meet all necessary standards to receive the distinction.</p>
<p>The final decision, however, was made by readers who chose Foxwoods for a second year as the best casino outside Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Guyot expressed his excitement by stating, “I can’t tell you how ecstatic we are. We truly believe that we are the best casino. This is validation for that. We’ve been going through a difficult time in the industry and the nation. So we’re extremely excited.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Foxwoods was again the readers’ choice for a great casino in the United States.</p>
