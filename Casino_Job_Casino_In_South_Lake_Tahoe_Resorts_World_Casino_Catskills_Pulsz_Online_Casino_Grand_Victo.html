<p>The parent company of Melco Resorts, Melco International Development Limited, is taking a minority role in mixed-use development and theme park in Zhongshan. That could cost as much as 10 billion yuan (US$1.55 billion).</p>

<p>The project site in Zhongshan neighbors Macau, where the company’s subsidiary Melco Resorts owns and operates its multibillion-dollar casino resorts.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Melco International announced it is initially investing $285.6 million into the undertaking. The remaining capital is coming from Agile Group Holdings, a publicly traded real estate development firm.</p>
<p>The securities filing announced the acquisition of a piece of vacant property measuring some 125 acres for $515 million.</p>
<p>Non-Gaming Destinations</p>
<p>Melco Resorts is one of six licensed commercial casino operators in Macau. Melco International controls 55.8 percent of the casino resort firm.</p>
<p>In Macau, Melco Resorts owns and operates Studio City, a Hollywood-themed integrated resort, and City of Dreams, an urban-themed complex. Both properties are located on the Cotai Strip.</p>
<p>Non-gaming attractions at the resorts include a waterpark, the world’s highest “figure-8 Ferris wheel,” a contemporary art museum, and a 17,000-square-foot “Kid’s City.”</p>
<p>Macau officials, at the direction of People’s Republic officials in Beijing, have been urging its casinos to diversify into non-gaming businesses. But there is little vacant development room remaining in Macau and Cotai, leading some to look to the neighboring province of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Macau International says the unnamed development in Zhongshan will “include residential, commercial, recreational, and entertainment elements, featuring ancillary facilities such as hotels, parks, and green areas.”</p>
<p>With the land acquired, Melco and Agile say the complex is targeting completion in 2025.</p>
<p>Analysts Approve Strategy</p>
<p>Melco Resorts, like each of the five other casino giants in Macau, the world’s richest gaming hub, suffered greatly in 2020. The firm reported a loss of approximately $1.6 billion last year.</p>
<p>Gaming analysts like the idea of Melco Resorts’ parent investing in non-gaming amenities.</p>
<p>While the project will not open before 2025, once in place, it can provide a co-marketing opportunity for Melco Resorts’ casino properties in Macau,” a note from Sanford Bernstein read.</p>
<p>The Bernstein analysts also believe the venture will only better improve Melco Resorts’ odds of being issued a new gaming license by Macau. All six casino operators will see the gaming privileges expire in June of 2022.</p>
<p>The Zhongshan project is additionally a sound business gamble, adds another expert.</p>
<p>“It’s a good tactic,” said Alva To, vice president of Greater China, a property consulting firm. “The proposed project will supplement Melco’s entertainment business in Macau.”</p>
