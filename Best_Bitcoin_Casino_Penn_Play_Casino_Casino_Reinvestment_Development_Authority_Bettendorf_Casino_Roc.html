<p>The second Thanksgiving Day game of 2022 is an NFC East duel – New York Giants vs Dallas Cowboys. Ahead of their Week 12 TNF clash, both teams are 7-3 and are two wins behind the divisional leaders, the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Eagles have a pretty tough schedule ahead, it’s not crazy for either of these teams to dream of the divisional title. Still, even if they fail to overtake Philly’s spot in the NFC East, both New York and Dallas could get to the playoffs, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The thing is that both teams are flying high in the conference, with the Cowboys sitting in the no.3 position in the NFC Standings and the Giants being just one spot below. The reason why the boys from Texas are ranked higher (even though both teams are 7-3 right now) is that they were the ones to win the first Giants vs Cowboys game of the 2022 season. But who’s gonna win the second?</p>

<p>New York Giants’ Weaknesses Exposed Last Weekend</p>
<p>The New York Giants are coming to Texas after a surprising loss to the Detroit Lions at home. Despite entering the game as 4-point favorites, the Giants ended up losing 31-18. The Lions were better in all aspects of the game, but what’s interesting is the way they scored their four TDs that afternoon.</p>
<p>Detroit’s QB Jared Goff and his receiving teammates were great in moving the ball to New York’s danger zone. Then, it was time for running back Jamaal Williams to take the stage. And he did his job great, scoring a hat trick that day.</p>
<p>We expect to see the Dallas Cowboys use a similar kind of tactic on Thanksgiving. Why? Because they definitely have the manpower to exploit all the weaknesses of the New York Giants’ defense. But what about vice versa? Do New York’s offensive players have what it takes to wreak havoc on Dallas?</p>
<p>With 20.5 points per game, the New York Giants rank 21st in the league. That’s not too bad, but there’s one thing that should worry them a lot – Dallas’ defense ranks first in the NFL with just 16.7 points conceded on average.</p>
<p>Brilliant is the word that best describes the performances of Mike McCarthy’s men over the last couple of weeks. They are 2-1 in the previous three weeks, but the loss in question happened in overtime – the Green Bay Packers beat them 31-28 at Lambeau. The two wins happened against the Chicago Bears (49-29) and the Minnesota Vikings (40-3).</p>
<p>As you can see, the Cowboys have been brilliant in the offense. Their average is 25.1 PPG overall, which makes them the seventh best offense in the NFL. However, if you take into account their performances from the last three games, they are the best in the league, with an average of 39.0 PPG.</p>
<p>Their defense ranks first in the league overall, although we did see them concede a lot of points lately. They conceded 31 against the Packers in Week 10 and 29 against the Bears a week before. Those are the only two games of 2022 in which they conceded more than 20 points. We believe they will keep it under that number on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>New York Giants vs Dallas Cowboys Prediction</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are winning this game, we have no doubt about it. They’re better than the Giants in literally every aspect of the game. That said, we think they will have no problems covering the spread on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Picks: Dallas Cowboys to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
