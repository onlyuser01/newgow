<p>DraftKings, the leading daily fantasy and sports betting operator announced on Wednesday a new agreement with the Oregon Lottery.</p>
<p>Oregon Lottery Teams up with DraftKings</p>
<p>Under the new deal, DraftKings will become an official sportsbook provider for the Oregon Lottery. As a part of the exclusive agreement, DraftKings’ sportsbook application is going to replace the current Scoreboard app. The change is expected to begin on January 18 and until then, the Scoreboard app is going to function as usual.</p>
<p>From then on, players will be able to create an account with DraftKings and transfer their funds to the operator’s sportsbook app. After January 18, some functionalities of the Scoreboard app will be restricted. With that in mind, users will still have access to account information, as well as transaction histories and withdrawal facility for six months after the transition. Also, open bets for users with the Scoreboard app will remain until settled.</p>
<p>The Company Keeps Focus On Responsible Gambling, Environmental Initiatives</p>
<p>DraftKings’ latest partnership with the Oregon Lottery marks the second exclusive lottery agreement inked by the company. The first one dates back to 2019 when DraftKings struck a deal with the New Hampshire Lottery.</p>
<p>Similar to other jurisdictions where DraftKings operates, responsible gambling remains a key priority for the company. This is why bettors in Oregon will be able to access the sportsbooks’ built-in responsible gambling tools that include self-exclusion, cooldowns and deposit limits.</p>
<p>Besides responsible gambling, DraftKings remains committed to environmental campaigns as well. In conjunction with the Arbor Day Foundation, the company funded the planting of 1 million trees by Earth Day this year. In Oregon alone, the company has funded the planting of more than 110,000 trees. DraftKings’ project spans across 15 US states, as well as nine countries globally.</p>
<p>DraftKings to Bring Its Unique Sportsbook Products for Oregon Sports Fans</p>
<p>Oregon Lottery’s director, Barry Pack, acknowledged that DraftKings is among the premier sportsbook providers in the US. He added that it is exciting to offer an improved experience and same game parlay bets for sports fans in the state. In conclusion, Pack outlined that the new partnership will bring benefits for the Lottery by decreasing the number of third-party service providers and introducing “a simpler financial structure for player accounts.”</p>
<p>“DraftKings is thrilled to embark on this journey with the Oregon Lottery as we build out a coast-to-coast presence with our top-rated online sportsbook for these fans to experience ahead of the NFL playoffs and Super Bowl.” Paul Liberman, co-founder and president global technology and product at DraftKings</p>
