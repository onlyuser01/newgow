<p>Yokozuna Clash review</p>
<p>Quick verdict Beautiful design, a brilliant bonus game, and a good RTP (96.30%) make this slot a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Yokozuna is the highest possible rank a sumo wrestler can achieve in the Japanese sport. In this sumo themed slot, it goes even further, with the highest level wrestling opponent being not just a sumo pro, but an actual demon.</p>
<p>The cartoonish style of the setting makes the sport come alive as an epic, one on one wrestling match for the ultimate title.</p>
<p>Slap those knees and put on some weight to join them in the ring.</p>
<p>Big win in the Yokozuna Clash slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are as flashy as anything else put out by Yggdrasil Gaming, who are always pushing their style to the max. Here, the cartoonish setting and reels are stylish and cool.</p>
<p>The world is beautifully realised, with neat animations on the reels and of the sumo wrestlers.</p>
<p>The music is dramatic and atmospheric. Clearly some money went into the percussive composition that plays in the background of the main game, and blends seamlessly with the win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>Win with a high symbol</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Gaming also invest in interesting gameplay. Here, the main innovation is in the bonus (see below).</p>
<p>The base game, however, is pretty straightforward, with five reels, three rows, and an any way wins system in place that gives up to 243 ways to win in both directions.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbol.</p>
<p>Two Bonus symbols on reels one and five trigger the Sumo Bonus Feature. In this bonus feature, the player gets free spins that continue until their player is pushed out of the ring. This occurs in the following way. When a player wins from left to right, their sumo pushes the other sumo back a step. When the player wins from right to left, the player’s sumo is pushed back. There are seven steps in either direction.</p>
<p>Throwing the enemy sumo out of the ring puts the player through to round two of the free spin bonus.</p>
<p>The sumos are randomly assigned and the sumos that are in the action each round determine the mix of wilds and multipliers that are applied to the wins. This very cool, interactive bonus is the major selling point for this unique and strange slot.</p>
<p>Semi-final fight as first tier of free spins bonus</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.30%, comfortably above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€125.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which is not the best match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Nice to look at, fun to play. This slot is a delight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for players using our strategies, the medium volatility is too low to be very useful.</p>
<p>However, for other players who are less concerned with this aspect of the game, it could be the perfect Japanese-themed choice.</p>
