    <h1>Gold Ranch Casino Chumba Casino 1 For 60 Hon Dah Casino Hotel Real Money No Deposit Casino We Ko Pa</h1>

<p>The last time when PokerStars stopped in Prague was back in 2019. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the European Poker Tour (EPT) was played online last year. Now, it is time for PokerStars to return once again to Prague with EPT Prague that starts this December.</p>
<p>PokerStars Returns to Prague in December</p>
<p>Much has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic started last year. The pandemic impacted all industries including the gambling industry. Casinos were forced to close their doors and once they were allowed to reopen strict COVID-related measures were implemented.</p>
<p>The pandemic also impacted live poker games. But poker tournaments quickly found a way to overcome those difficulties by switching to online editions. This was precisely the case for the European Poker Tour (EPT). Although last year, due to the pandemic, the event was changed to an online version, this year, poker fans will be able to participate in live-action at Hilton Hotel in Prague, the Czech Republic in December.</p>
<p>While the dress code for the event is casual, no sportswear is allowed. Each of the visitors must bring a photo ID or a passport to enter the casino, but they must also follow strict health and safety measures that will be implemented.</p>

<p>COVID-Related Health and Safety Measures Will Be in Place</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of guests and staff, PokerStars, in collaboration with Kings Casino and the Hilton Prague Hotel will implement strict health and safety measures. The guidelines coincide with the current COVID-19 safety measures introduced by the Czech government.</p>
<p>PokerStars revealed that visitors of the ETP Prague will need to provide a vaccination certificate. If that’s not available, they need to present a negative PCR test which can be a maximum of 7 days old, or a negative antigen test result which can be 72 hours old. For the convenience of players, the organizers offer free-of-charge rapid antigen tests on-site.</p>

The venue will display signage encouraging social distancing and there will also be personal protection equipment (PPE) stations supplying hand sanitizers, disposal masks and gloves.</p>
