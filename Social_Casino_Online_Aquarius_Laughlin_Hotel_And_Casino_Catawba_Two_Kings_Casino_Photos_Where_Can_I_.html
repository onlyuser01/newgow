<p>The operator has revealed plans to launch in the highly-contested North American market with the company choosing Canada as its gateway country</p>
<p>The company will be rolling out its products for the first time in Ontario, Canada, and it will provide local players with access to both the Videoslots and Mr Vegas sister brand gaming websites.</p>
<p>Players will have access to a large variety of titles provided by some of the world’s leading iGaming developers, to wit Play’n GO, Evolution, Light &amp; Wonder, Pariplay, NoLimit City, Quickspin, Greentube, Games Global, and not least Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>This means that moving forward, Videoslots will have the opportunity to access popular features such as Clash of Spins, The Wheel of Jackpots, and Battle of Slots, among others. All of these are designed to boost player engagement and create more worthwhile and meaningful experiences for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Videoslots Embarks on North America with Ontario Launch</p>
<p>This expansion into the regulated iGaming market in Ontario marks the seventh international gaming license that the company has obtained. Previously, Videoslots has been licensed and still holds licenses in Malta, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Commenting on the upcoming launch Deputy CEO at Videoslots Ulle Skottling said:</p>
<p>Launching in Ontario is another milestone for the Videoslots team, and we are excited at the prospect of entertaining players in the region. Deputy CEO at Videoslots Ulle Skottling</p>
<p>Skottling noted that Videoslots has been enjoying a good reception in global markets and entering the regulated market in Canada was something that the company has long wanted for its operations.</p>
<p>This new entry comes at a time of rapid changes inside Videoslots as well. The company recently appointed Kim Lindsjö as its new head of affiliates. Videoslots has also been expanding its global footprint by bringing new suppliers on board. Although the company has faced some regulatory headwinds in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, Videoslots remains committed to regulated and licensed gambling.</p>
