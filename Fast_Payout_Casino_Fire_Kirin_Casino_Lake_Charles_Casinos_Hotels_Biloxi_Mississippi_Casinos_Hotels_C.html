<p>Red Rake Gaming, an online casino supplier with a leading position in multiple markets, is solidifying its presence in the Netherlands through a partnership with JOI Gaming and its local casino brand, JACKS.nl.</p>
<p>The tie-up will see Red Rake Gaming deliver a number of its games with the local operator and allow players the opportunity to access more innovative content. Some of the titles that will be featured on the operator include Guardian of Ra, 2 Kings of Africa, Medusa Hunt, and many more.</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming has polished features such as a million ways to win and other innovative content developed in-house to provide Dutch players with fresh iGaming experiences. The partnership was readily welcomed by Red Rake Gaming Managing Director Nick Barr who said that this content alliance with JACKS.NL would allow the company to quickly reach new audiences and bring some of the best games to players.</p>
<p>"We are very confident the Red Rake Gaming will play a strong part in JACKS.NL’s continued growth and delighted to work with all the team at JOI Gaming," Barr added.</p>
<p>JOI Gaming Head of Gaming and Retention Sjoerd Kranz was similarly delighted with the opportunity to add Red Rake’s titles to the company’s library and empower the portfolio with yet more exciting titles that are bound to strike home with Dutch audiences.</p>
<p>"Offering these games on JACKS.NL will enhance our portfolio even more and create a strong extension to the product offering on our platform," Kranz added.</p>
<p>Red Rake Gaming has sought to expand beyond the Netherlands, with the supplier signing a deal with Napoleon Casino in Belgium several months ago. Speaking of Belgium, Red Rake also negotiated another deal to present its content with Starcasino.be in the country.</p>
<p>The company similarly launched at PokerStars in May, as the famous poker company is actively looking to also strengthen its presence in the online casino vertical. Overall, the company has created some exciting games including Mystic Spirits, Gods of Ireland, Gold Rush: Riches, and Ramses Legacy.</p>
<p>The portfolio is constantly expanding, adding fresh opportunities for partners and players to enjoy a bonafide iGaming experience.</p>
