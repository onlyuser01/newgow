<p>Online gaming marketing affiliate firm Raketech announced that as of December 9, 2021, it acquired all assets and liabilities of A.T.S. Consultants, closing the previously announced transaction.</p>
<p>Positioned for US Growth Opportunities</p>
<p>Stockholm-listed Raketech said it “strengthened its sports portfolio and US footprint” via the addition of A.T.S. Consultants’ assets, including Winnersandwhiners.com, Statsalt.com and Pickpapa.com, while A.T.S. Consultants’ team of employees is now an integrated part of the talent team at Raketech following the successful completing of the acquisition.</p>
<p>“With all formalities now successfully closed I look very much forward to combining our commercial models and to share technology and know-how between our teams to address the so important US market.” Oskar Mühlbach, CEO, Raketech</p>
<p>Raketech CEO Mühlbach in his comments also outlined that the acquisition of A.T.S. Consultants means that over 20% of Raketech’s revenues in the first quarter of 2022 would be coming from US operations as the newly-acquired assets positioned the company to take advantage of the rapid growth across US markets.</p>
<p>“…I am happy that we through this acquisition strengthen our US organization with a strong local team with extended knowledge within the US sports industry. I am confident that together with the A.T.S. team we will be able to accelerate the growth of our market share in the US sports industry,” Mühlbach concluded.</p>
<p>Transaction Details</p>
<p>In October, Raketech and A.T.S. Consultants reached an agreement for the acquisition of the US-based firm by the online gambling affiliate in a cash plus stock deal valued at $15.5 million of which $12 million an upfront cash payment and $1 million in cash additionally paid six months after the transaction close.</p>
<p>The remaining $2.5 million of the total price will be settled through Raketech shares with a 36-month lock-up period. Based on certain performance measures, there is a possibility for additional payments 36 months after closing the deal.</p>
<p>Representing a multiple of approximately 6x EBITDA and 2.5x revenues for the last twelve months, the acquisition is expected to help Raketech reach over €50 million ($56.5 million) in annual revenue and an EBITDA margin of more than 40%.</p>
<p>Raketech has already identified several growth and development opportunities for its new US assets, among which the implementation of the company’s technology infrastructure and the introduction of affiliate marketing sales across all licensed jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A.T.S. Consultants are the latest US entity acquired by Raketech, following in the footsteps of the purchase of P&amp;P Vegas Group, the US subsidiary of Stockholm-listed QM Media AB, including its US betting tipster community, Pickandparlays.net and Onlinecricketbetting.net websites.</p>
