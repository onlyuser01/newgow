<p>The global sports betting, gaming and entertainment provider, Flutter Entertainment, announced Thursday it achieved prestigious safer gambling certifications for its leading brands in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Three Flutter Online Brands Awarded Certification by GamCare</p>
<p>The company revealed its brands Paddy Power, Betfair and Sky Betting &amp; Gaming have been awarded the Advanced Safer Gambling Standard by GamCare, the leading British provider of information, advice and support for people affected by problem gambling. Achieving the certification marks an incredible moment for Flutter, which is already famous for its strong dedication to responsible gambling. Each of the three flagship Flutter brands was awarded Gold Advanced Level 3, which is the highest level of certification by GamCare.</p>
<p>Flutter revealed that the certification comes after the brands have gone through an assessment. Considering the Safer Gambling Standard award, it is safe to say that the company’s three brands actively encourage and support safer gambling entertainment. According to Flutter, tombola, its leading online bingo brand is planning to achieve Advanced Level 3 certification as well. The company explained that the reassessment of tombola by GamCare is expected to be completed soon.</p>
<p>“It is a hugely proud moment for everyone at Flutter to have all of our online brands awarded the highest gambling changes by GamCare.“ Luke Sugden, director of risk and safer gambling, Flutter UK and Ireland</p>
<p>Flutter’s UK and Ireland director of risk and safer gambling, Luke Sugden, said that the company is proud to see its online brands achieve the highest certification by GamCare. He explained that safer gambling is a part of Flutter’s global sustainability strategy. This strategy includes Play Well and the Positive Impact Plan, two initiatives that seek to ensure a safe, positive and entertaining experience for Flutter’s customers. Last but not least, Sugden said: “This certification not only signals progress against this commitment, but is a credit to our fantastic colleagues, who continue to put safer gambling at the heart of everything we do as a business.”</p>
<p>The Company Rolled Out Additional Safer Gambling Measures</p>
<p>Flutter is truly a leader when it comes to safer gambling. Seeking to protect its younger customers within the UK and Ireland, the company’s brands introduced mandatory deposit limits for anyone under the age of 25. In addition, the brands implemented a £10 ($11.60) limit on slots and implemented an Affordability Triple Step method that further boosts the protection for online players.</p>
<p>To keep track of its progress on responsible gambling, Flutter introduced safer gambling KPIs. Additionally, the operator implemented remuneration for safer gambling objectives and introduced improvements within its assurance and compliance processes. Another key step in the process toward safer gambling was the increase in Flutter’s safer gambling team which currently has a head count surpassing 200 people. Besides awarding the company’s brands, GamCare also praised it for its “positive culture regarding safer gambling amongst its UK&amp;I brands.”</p>
