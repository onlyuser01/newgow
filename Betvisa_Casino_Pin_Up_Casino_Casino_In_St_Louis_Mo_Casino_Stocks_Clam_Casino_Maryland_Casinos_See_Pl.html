<p>Maryland Casinos See Downturn, February Gaming Revenue Totals $157M</p>

<p>Gaming revenues supplied by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency reveal the casinos won $157 million in February 2023. That’s a 3.6% year-over-year decrease or a decline of about $5.9 million from February 2022.</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor, Live! Casino &amp; Hotel, Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, Ocean Downs Casino, Rocky Gap Casino Resort, and Hollywood Casino Perryville won over $2 billion in 2022 from their slot machines and table games. The record-setting revenue experienced last year represented a nearly 7% year-over-year improvement.</p>
<p>Maryland Casino Revenue</p>
<p>$2.05B — 2022</p>
<p>$1.92B — 2021</p>
<p>$1.22B — 2020</p>
<p>$1.75B — 2019</p>
<p>$1.74B — 2018</p>
<p>$1.61B — 2017</p>
<p>$1.20B — 2016</p>
<p>$1.09B — 2015</p>
<p>MGM National Harbor, the market leader in Maryland, opened in December 2016. The integrated resort operated by MGM Resorts led the way last year with GGR of $884.4 million.</p>
<p>2023 Slowdown?</p>
<p>Maryland casinos continued their 2022 run into the new year with a prosperous January. Gross gaming revenue (GGR) totaled just shy of $167.3 million — an 8.8% gain on January 2022 that kicked off the state gaming industry’s record-setting campaign.</p>
<p>The state gaming industry managed through ongoing inflation and economic concerns, but the more than 12-month rally finally slowed in February. National Harbor reported nearly flat GGR of $65.6 million, a 0.4% year-over-year decline.</p>
<p>Live! Casino, the second-richest casino in Maryland, saw GGR drop more than 6% to about $55.7 million. Horseshoe Baltimore’s year-over-year decline was even greater with an 8% drop to $16.3 million.</p>
<p>The state’s three resort casinos combined to win about $19.4 million — a decline of about 3%. Ocean Downs was the only Maryland casino to report a year-over-year GGR gain in February 2023 at 3.7%. Churchill Downs, Inc. owned and operated the casino, won $6.8 million.</p>
<p>February 2023 had the same number of weekend days — eight — as February 2022. No significant weather last month could be cited for the gaming regression.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Benefit</p>
<p>Should the February casino trend continue into March and throughout 2023, some of the year-over-year comparable losses will be partially offset by the addition of online sports betting.</p>
<p>Gambling on professional and college sports in the Old Line State began in person at the state’s casinos in December 2021. Online sports betting, which Marylanders also authorized through a November 2020 referendum, only began in mid-November 2022.</p>
<p>In December, online sportsbooks accounted for over $478.2 million of the $497.2 million wagered on sports. Oddsmakers said they kept nearly $85.2 million of the bets on a strong 17% hold. Online books won $82.3 million.</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks continue to battle for market share with substantial promotional incentives for new customers. The December handle included more than $70.9 million in free bets.</p>
<p>Bettors tend to place free wagers on events with longer odds than they otherwise would with their own money. That led to the significant hold rate.</p>
<p>In January, promotional bets slowed, as bettors eager to wager legally online have used much of their incentives. Promotional wagers in January totaled about $21.8 million.</p>
<p>January GGR from sports betting totaled $59.6 million on a 13.5% hold. February numbers have not yet been revealed.</p>
