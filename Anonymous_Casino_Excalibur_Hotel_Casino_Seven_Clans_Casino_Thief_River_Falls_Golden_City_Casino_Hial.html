    <h1>Anonymous Casino Excalibur Hotel Casino Seven Clans Casino Thief River Falls Golden City Casino Hial</h1>

<p>On 1/15/21 I made 7 8 9 of clubs on the free bet black Jack having bet 4/5 euros on each side bet. The corresponding box does not come on and therefore I "believe" that I have not been paid. My "creed" has become certainty in checking the history of plays.</p>
<p>I think they are all there, too bad that the straight flush is missing. I could not go wrong with the verification because there are about 30 games from 18.30 to 19.30.</p>
<p>Finally: I started playing on RABONA at 4.00 on 15/01 (with 50 euros) to test the site.</p>
<p>When asked to withdraw â‚¬ 250 on a credit balance of 420, I am told in English that it is not possible.</p>
<p>Not bad, we'll see later.</p>
<p>Then, the icing on the cake of the winning bet is gone!</p>
<p>I wrote to customer support for explanations because, maybe, it could be a technical problem.</p>
<p>We will see if, and what they will answer me.</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
