<p>The latest collaboration will help the leading development studio reach new audiences in different markets around the world</p>
<p>BF Games, the leading development studio offering dynamic games for the online gambling industry, announced a new strategic content agreement, allowing it to significantly expand its reach. The company revealed Wednesday it joined forces with the iGaming behemoth, SOFTSWISS. Per the freshly minted deal, BF Games agreed to supply its portfolio of games for SOFTSWISS, delivering its unique titles to new audiences across the globe.</p>
<p>Currently, BF Games offers a growing portfolio of more than 80 unique slot games. Thanks to the new collaboration, those games will become available via SOFTSWISS’ Game Aggregator, the company’s leading iGaming content hub. The new content deal will enable clients in new markets to experience BF Games’ thrilling portfolio.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, SOFTSWISS’ partners and their clients will tap into top-performing and fan-favorite titles from the iGaming developer. Such include the famous Chicken Madness Ultra, Stunning Cash, as well as Horizon Hunters, among others.</p>
<p>Famous as a provider of dynamic slots that stand out with engaging features, BF Games already has a strong presence in strategic markets such as Latin America, North America, as well as Europe. Now, thanks to the collaboration with SOFTSWISS, the company will expand further its global footprint, bringing its unique games to new customers.</p>
<p>Late last month, BF Games joined forces with SkillOnNet for a new content deal. That collaboration boosted further the iGaming developer’s presence within the iGaming vertical while at the same time expanding SkillOnNet’s offering.</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the latest deal, by teaming up with BF Games, SOFTSWISS expands the offering of its Game Aggregator. The company’s partners can now benefit from more than 16,000 games available within the aggregator platform and that portfolio continues to grow.</p>
<p>The Content Agreement Brings Excitement to the Duo</p>
<p>Tatyana Kaminskaya, SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator’s head, revealed that the company is thrilled to team up with BF Games. She said that it is exciting to see BF Games become the latest partner for Game Aggregator. Finally, Kaminskaya said: “This cooperation will expand the game content options available to our clients, and will surely showcase the game provider’s outstanding content to new players.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted that BF Games is becoming a SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator partner.“ Tatyana Kaminskaya, head of SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator</p>
<p>Claudia Melcaru, BF Games’ head of business development, explained that the latest deal reaffirms the company’s commitment to become a go-to provider for the online gambling sector and continue to expand. Last but not least, she said that BF Games continues to grow its portfolio of offering, delivering thrilling new games which can now be accessed via SOFTSWISS’ portfolio of partners and their clients across the globe.</p>
