    <h1>Island View Casino Gulfport Ms California Hotel Casino Hotels Near Horseshoe Casino 123 Vegas Casino</h1>

<p>I quote the text from the email again.</p>
<p>There I often mentioned that I suffer from gambling addiction!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>I paid very large sums of money through a game of chance organized by you illegally on the Internet. A total of 4870 euros.</p>
<p>Accordingly, these are fees for public games of chance on the Internet.</p>
<p>I now have my gambling addiction under control and know how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Organizing and arranging online games of chance is prohibited under Section 4 (4) of the GlüStV. "(4) Organizing and arranging public games of chance on the Internet is prohibited." (§ 4 Para. 4 GlüStV) This prohibition is also compatible with constitutional and Union law. As early as 2009, the ECJ confirmed that the ban on online gambling is compatible with the freedom to provide services protected under European law in accordance with Art. 49 EC. In this judgment, the ECJ first stated that the online gambling ban naturally restricts the freedom to provide services. However, this restriction may be justified for overriding reasons of public interest. The ECJ sees such compelling reasons of general interest in the fight against crime. (ECJ, judgment of 08.09.2009 -C 42/07-)</p>
<p>It was only because of my illness that I paid you such high amounts during the period in question. I know again a judgment of LG Gießen, judgment 01/21/2021 - 4 O 84/20 and a judgment of the district court Regensburg of 05/31/2021 (Az.: 71 O 3074/20)</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible for me to legally register on your website and make such high contributions. This is reinforced by my gambling addiction. This obliges you to pay back my full losses. Quote from the LG Traunstein on October 8th, 2020: The plaintiff can also base his claim on § 812 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BGB, since his payments to the defendant were made without legal reason. The contract for gambling on the defendant's Internet domain is void under Section 134 of the German Civil Code, since the organization of public gambling on the Internet is prohibited under Section 4 (4) of the 1st State Treaty on Gambling Amendments. Whether this game of chance is permitted at the defendant's place of business is irrelevant, since German law is applicable. Since it is a prohibited game of chance, § 762 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BGB, according to which the payment made as a result of a game cannot be reclaimed, is not applicable (cf. Palandt/Sprau, BGB, 79th ed. 2020, § 763 edge 3).</p>
<p>Also, as you know with certainty, the case law in Germany is always clearer and leaves no room for doubt about my key points.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that my demand for reimbursement from you was successful in a German court.</p>
<p>My gambling addiction and your lack of player protection make things more difficult for you .</p>
<p>If I do not receive a response from you by March 6th, 2023, I will hire a specialist lawyer to file the lawsuit. This step is then essential. The fact that this lawsuit is successful has already been confirmed without a doubt by several legal entities.</p>
<p>I can enclose a copy of a certificate of my addiction and its advice if required.</p>
<p>Best regards "</p>
