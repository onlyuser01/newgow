<p>The company on a mission to make sports entertainment more engaging and fun, Better Collective, announced a leadership-level appointment Thursday. As a result, Petra Zackrisson, a seasoned veteran with years of experience in the industry, was appointed senior vice president of growth.</p>
<p>Targeting Expansion, Better Collective Appoints SVP of Growth</p>
<p>The appointment comes at a time when Better Collective plans to expand further its global presence. The company explained that the leadership-level hire seeks to boost its growth and accelerate the company’s presence in new jurisdictions around the globe. As an SVP of growth, Zackrisson will oversee strategic processes primarily related to Better Collective’s expansion in new markets.

According to Better Collective, she will step into her new position effective January 9, 2023.</p>
