<p>The five recipients will use the funding to develop prevention innovation and prevention amplification programs</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has announced the recipients of its Fall 2023 Agility Grants. As a result, a total of $176,000 will be distributed among five non-profit organizations that deal with problem gambling.</p>
<p>Under the NCPG Agility Grants program, the council will provide over a million dollars to problem gambling charities between 2022 and 2024, helping them prevent gambling harm in the country.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the recipients include the Alabama Council on Compulsive Gambling Prevention (ACCG), the Problem Gambling Coalition of Colorado, the AdCare Educational Institute of Maine, The LCADA Way and the Maryland Council on Problem Gambling. For reference, the first two parties will develop prevention innovation programs, while the remaining three will work on prevention amplification programs.</p>
<p>Two Organization Will Develop Prevention Innovation Initiatives</p>
<p>ACCG’s program “It’s More Than Just a Game” seeks to leverage education to teach middle school students in Alabama about the dangers of gambling. The program will see the students presented with a series of gambling and video gaming scenarios that will test their knowledge. The correct answers will be discussed with the whole class. Students will also be provided with educational pamphlets on the matter.</p>
<p>The Problem Gambling Coalition of Colorado, meanwhile, is working with the Denver Justice High School and the Denver Art Society to deliver the so-called Stacked Deck problem gambling prevention curriculum to high schoolers. This project will leverage art-based activities to teach students about responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Three Parties Will Work on Prevention Amplification Programs</p>
<p>AdCare Educational Institute of Maine, on the other hand, will join forces with The New England Prevention Technology Transfer Center to develop a graphic novel about youth gambling prevention. The novel, which will be distributed across New England and available in three languages, is a part of the Youth Gambling Prevention Graphic Medicine project.</p>
<p>Additionally, the LCADA Way will launch the Lorain County Problem Gambling Prevention Initiative in hopes of raising awareness about the risks of gambling harm and teaching the players to make responsible decisions. Campaign material creation will be led by teenagers in hopes of appealing to younger demographics.</p>
<p>Finally, the Maryland Council on Problem Gambling will launch Culturally Infused Problem Gambling Prevention for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Consumers. This brand new program will see the council use the Agility Grant funding to design “culturally specific prevention public awareness materials” that appeal to people with hearing impairments.</p>
<p>About the Agility Grants</p>
<p>The Agility Grants are backed by the NFL through the NFL Foundation, in line with the league’s commitment to promote responsible gambling.</p>
<p>FanDuel, one of the biggest gambling operators in the country, is also a sponsor of the program.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, executive director at the NCPG, commented on the matter, highlighting his team’s desire to “foster dynamic and responsive problem gambling prevention programs” across the country.</p>
<p>Each recipient receiving support this round displayed exemplary commitment to cultural competence, tailoring their approaches with sensitivity to the diverse needs of the populations they serve. Keith Whyte, executive director, NCPG</p>
<p>The grants have an emphasis on prevention innovation, collaboration, amplification and community impact and represent the council’s desire to make a change. They are awarded through funding rounds two times a year.</p>
