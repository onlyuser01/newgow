<p>Max Holloway vs. The Korean Zombie will serve as the headliner fight of the next UFC event</p>
<p>Both Max Holloway and The Korean Zombie were given a shot at the UFC Featherweight title last year, but each of them failed to take it from Alexander Volkanovski. Now, they’re fighting to determine which one should be given another chance to win the championship belt. Or at least they’ll get to fight Ilia Topuria (or some other rising star) in a title eliminator bout.</p>

<p>Max Holloway to Show Why He’s No. 1 Contender</p>
<p>Max Holloway (24-7) is a former UFC Featherweight champ who lost his title to Alex Volkanovski by unanimous decision in 2019. Volk defeated him by split decision in a rematch in 2020. Then, Holloway went on to win the next two fights before giving another shot at the title. Unfortunately for him, the Aussie beat him again. This time, it was by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Since his third loss to Volkanovski, he’s entered the Octagon once. It happened last April when we saw him beat Arnold Allen by unanimous decision. Winning another fight would get Holloway back in the title conversation.</p>
<p>Whether he’d get to fight Volk for the fourth time, or he’d need to fight a rising star like undefeated Georgian-Spanish prospect Ilia Topuria is still unclear. However, beating The Korean Zombie is a must for the Hawaiian legend if he wants to stay relevant.</p>
<p>The Korean Zombie Will Try to Take Holloway Down</p>
<p>The Korean Zombie is 17-7 in his professional career, with a TKO loss to Volkanovski in his most recent fight. Jung Chan-sung, as his real name is, is a real jack of all trades. He’s a former kickboxer, who also has a black belt in judo, as well as one in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>In theory, he should be able to go to war with Holloway, and maybe even get himself a win. The thing, however, is that Holloway is a striking genius, who holds the record for most significant strikes in the history of the UFC.</p>
<p>The Korean Zombie just cannot win if the UFC Singapore main event turns into a striking duel. However, he does stand a chance if the fight goes to the ground. The problem is that taking Holloway down is a real challenge. Even the wrestling expert Volkanovski failed to do it the last time they fought.</p>
<p>Max Holloway vs. The Korean Zombie Prediction</p>
<p>Max Holloway is a much, much better striker than The Korean Zombie. Plus, he’s got decent TD defense, meaning that he should be able to keep the fight upright. If everything goes according to his plan, he’s going to win this fight, most likely by another decision.</p>
<p>Pick: Max Holloway to win</p>
