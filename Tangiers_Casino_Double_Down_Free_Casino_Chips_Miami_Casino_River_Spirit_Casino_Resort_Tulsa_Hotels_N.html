    <h1>Tangiers Casino Double Down Free Casino Chips Miami Casino River Spirit Casino Resort Tulsa Hotels N</h1>

<p>First of all, I am not living in the USA, but cannot change it.</p>
<p>I played at Crashino with my deposit of 1073.67(194.76+278.53+600.3 USDT) on 19th Feb. and won 1250.38 USDT</p>
<p>and applied a withdrawal of 1250.38. However, after 6 hours it shows have not sent my withdrawal request.</p>
<p>during that time I had a bonus which should wager 40X with 200$. and won 5787.94 USDT. and it transferred into my balance automatically. and played again. finally remained 3004.47 USDT</p>
<p>After that, I found my 1250.38 USDT was still there and requested to cancel and merge the amount and applied withdrawal again.</p>
<p>After 80 HOURS later, they said the bonus winning amount cannot be over 250$ and they canceled all my withdrawal requests and modified the whole amount to 250$, and MADE a withdrawal request by themselves using my account without my permission without any message first, and ignored and deleted my previous withdrawal amount 1250.38 which I won with my deposit 1073.67 USDT</p>
<p>I formally make a complaint.</p>
<p>Crashino modified my(user) balance without any notification after 80 hours from my requests and made a withdrawal. Even they have a chance to announce it to me and get permission to modify my account. Crashino should get it back to me MY winning(1250.38USDT) + bonus winning 250$(this one I already get it) which I truly made using my deposit (1073.67USDT), and they should apologize, that they did not investigate it clearly and modify and deleted my true income. Crashino should not give a bonus to users which users cannot withdraw the amount. if the maximum bonus withdrawal amount is 250$ after the 40X wagering with 200$, should be input the balance of only 250$ automatically, not the whole amount. So that cannot make the same problem with users.</p>
<p>I totally understand that you cannot give me the whole bonus income 3004.47, I don't care, it's not usual but can happen. and received 250$.</p>
<p>But you guys should give me at least 1250.38 USDT which is my true income and deposit.</p>
<p>Cannot upload more than 5 screenshot, if you need more, please let me know.</p>
