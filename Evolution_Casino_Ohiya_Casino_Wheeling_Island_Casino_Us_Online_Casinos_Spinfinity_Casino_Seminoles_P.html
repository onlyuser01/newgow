<p>Seminole Tribe Allegedly Paying Off Signature Gatherers to Sabotage Ballot Initiatives</p>

<p>The Seminole tribe of Florida is buying off petition gathering firms in a bid to sabotage voter-led challenges to its state gaming monopolies, a POLITICO story claims.</p>

<p>One such company, Dunton Consulting, employed by Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS), told the politics-focused website it had lost 32 signature gatherers to the Seminoles in the previous two days alone. That’s more than half its team.</p>
<p>Dunton CEO Rasheida Smith said her employees were being offered money upfront to stop work, followed by an additional payment three days later, up to $7,000 in total. They’re also being awarded $250 bonuses for each Dunton employee they can recruit to switch sides and work for the tribe.</p>
<p>LVS Initiative</p>
<p>The Seminoles hold a monopoly on casino gaming in Florida at their seven Hard Rock-branded casinos. They want it to stay that way.</p>
<p>The tribe also, at least nominally, holds a monopoly on sports betting, per a compact negotiated and signed with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). Last week, a federal judge tossed out the agreement, although the Tribe is appealing the decision.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Las Vegas-based LVS has long harbored an ambition to open a casino in Florida. It has teamed up with Alabama’s Poarch Band of Creek Indians on a ballot initiative called “Florida Voters in Charge.”</p>
<p>This initiative is hoping to ask voters at a 2020 ballot whether they want to change the state constitution to allow pari-mutuel card rooms in North Florida to become full-fledged casinos. That’s provided they are 130 miles away from the Seminole reservation.</p>
<p>This could allow LVS or the Poarch Creeks to buy a cardroom in or around the Jacksonville area that could then be transformed into a casino resort.</p>
<p>Canvassers ‘Harassed’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, DraftKings and FanDuel have an initiative of their own, “Florida Education Champions.” For obvious reasons, they want voters to back a more open and inclusive betting market for Florida.</p>
<p>But the company in charge of that signature-gathering campaign, Advanced Micro Targeting, said its canvassers were being “harassed.”</p>
<p>Zachery Herrington, the company’s state director, told POLITICO he is concerned the tribe is hiring unprofessional or even “dangerous” staffers.</p>
<p>They will harass us for a spot. They will do something like piss someone off at a DMV, or a courthouse, or a parking lot, then everyone gets kicked out,” Herrington said. “It’s designed to burn that turf for everyone.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the tribe said they do not condone or tolerate such tactics by their canvassers, and would fire staff who engaged in aggressive behavior.</p>
