<p>The supplier is making another important stride into the European market with its arrival on NetBet’s Italian online casino</p>
<p>ESA Gaming, a leading supplier of online casino gaming content, will be delivering its EasySwipe original portfolio to the prominent operator, helping it benefit from a number of high-ranking and player-favorite titles.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming and NetBet Embark on Multi-Jurisdictional Pivot</p>
<p>The agreement does not focus on the Italian market exclusively, though, as under licenses from Malta and Romania, ESA Gaming and NetBet will be able to take the entire EasySwipe portfolio through other jurisdictions as well. Some of the releases that players will enjoy include Fruitbloxx and Pirate Mine, along with 13 more titles.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming has long touted the advantages of its EasySwipe portfolio, designed to appeal to diverse audiences, but also built in a way that allows companies to integrate the products easily into their portfolios no matter what infrastructure they use.</p>
<p>The supplier has also been heavily focusing on what it describes as a “non-traditional” type of content which is quickly becoming players’ favorite owing to its simplicity and freshness. Italy, Romania and MGA-covered jurisdictions are also just a part of the long list of places where the ESA wants to expand further.</p>
<p>ESA Gaming head of marketing Thomas Smallwood welcomed the opportunity to team up with NetBet and bring its products online with the prominent operator in Italy and beyond. Growth across multiple regulated markets is of particular importance to the company. Smallwood said:</p>
<p>This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to providing innovative non-traditional games to our partners and we are excited about the opportunities it presents for both companies. ESA Gaming head of marketing Thomas Smallwood</p>
<p>NetBet Group PR manager Claudia Georgevici welcomed the chance to be working with ESA Gaming and bring even more worthwhile titles to the NetBet portfolio. We are delighted to have access to their EasySwipe portfolio, which includes a range of high-quality, mobile-first games that are sure to be a hit with our customers,” Georgevici said.</p>
