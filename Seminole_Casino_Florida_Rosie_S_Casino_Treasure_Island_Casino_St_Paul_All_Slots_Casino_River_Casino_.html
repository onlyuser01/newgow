    <h1>Seminole Casino Florida Rosie S Casino Treasure Island Casino St Paul All Slots Casino River Casino</h1>

<p>Dear casino Guru ,</p>
<p>I 100% respectively apologize for my language and irrational outburst ! As you can understand I was extremely upset ! I have not won on any gaming very much and never this much ! I could barely contain my excitement and was so looking forward to my cash out and doing something I had wanted to do so badly and that was go see my father it has been 5 yrs since I've seen him and his health is very bad ! I had pack ,put a car on reserve ,made arrangements, and my dad and brother was anchiously awaiting my arrival ! It is a 932mile drive takes about 16hrs or more to get there they live in the vally in Texas, I live in Southern mo. So that's why I was so upset with winport casino they had to be the ones to take the money back it was not in my bitcoin wallet more than 2 minutes ! And it was not $1050 ! First it was $1034 in the morning and 20 hrs later it was $1054 and I looked the other day and it said like $1062 . I caught them living like 3 different times ! And there's no way a hacker could of known that presise day ,time,amount,and all that ! Thier input and out put wallet addresses was the same in/ out ! And they sent it 20hrs before it was supposed to be there!I called right after it disappeared and they had no idea of it and did not know what I was talking about said wait 24hrs ,well 20 hrs later when the amount changed I called again this time they was knollagble of the first transaction that morning ! They lied about knowing the hash number then when they dud try to give it to me they gave 3 different ones! There is no doubt in my mind they did it I didn't even have time to transfer it or rely even look at it cause it erased that fast ! My phone wasn't even in my hands when it happened I was looking for a code in a small paper note pad I keep in my purse ! I know from the bottom of my gut they did it ! And they say all thier mumbo jumbo and how else do I prove it when they say this and that ! It's just a loss ,a disappointment, a heartbreak,a basket of broken dreams! I just wish they would of said in the beginning they wasn't going to pay me cause at least I wouldn't of spent what money I did have and the anticipation of seeing my family before hand ! I was upset and still am ! But no excuse for loosing my wits and behaving in that manor! I apologize for that ! Thank you for your tolerance and help ,</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Becca G .</p>
