    <h1>Casino In Myrtle Beach Escanaba Casino Vegas Strip Casinos Apache Casino Lawton Ok Casino In Souther</h1>

<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>After 24+ days of trying to verify my account (very slow process from goldwin) I finally was able to do it and my cashout got rejected.</p>
<p>The reason was: -played delayed rounds of Buffalo King Megaways and Crystal Caverns Megaways; Fruit Party and Phoenix Forge; Phoenix Forge and Great Rhino Megaways; Great Rhino Megaways and The Dog House Megaways; Wild West gold and Madame Destiny Megaways.</p>
<p>On their general terms and conditions for playing with bonuses:</p>
<p>7.33 It is forbidden to: ''Delay any playing rounds, including free spins and bonus rounds, for the time when you donâ€™t need to wager the bonus or/and make new deposits.''</p>
<p>I'd like say that at the time i was using a VPN (they do not forbid it) and i had several disconnects, but everytime that happened I immediately opened the slot again and played the round. I did not delay it on purpose and I DID NOT open any delayed bonuses when my wager was done.</p>
<p>Aftrer wager was done i requested my cashout right after and did not play any slots in between.</p>
<p>I asked for proof that i played those delayed rounds after wagering was completed, but they stopped answering me.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
