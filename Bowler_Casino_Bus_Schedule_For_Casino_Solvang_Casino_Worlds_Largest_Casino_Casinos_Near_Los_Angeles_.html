<p>Play’n Go is determined to make its presence in the North American market felt. The company has already had two successful market launches in the region with Ontario and New Jersey, but now the company is readying up to attend the Global Gaming Expo, known simply as G2E to industry stakeholders, which will be taking place in Las Vegas, Nevada next week.</p>
<p>The company, which is headquartered in Sweden, and has been one of the most prolific developers and distributors of iGaming content is feeling more confident about its reach in the North American market.</p>
<p>As the importance of iGaming in North America becomes more visible, it’s crucial for European companies to make the trek across the Atlantic and secure market access and reach in the United States for starters. This is the first time Play’n Go will have been exhibiting in Las Vegas, on the occasion of one of the most significant industry get-togethers.</p>
<p>Play’n Go CEO and Co-founder Johan Törnqvist welcomed the opportunity to introduce his company to local operators and businesses that can only stand to benefit from Play’n Go’s unique proposition and value that it brings to the market. Play’n Go has been part of the European market for 20 years now, Törnqvist shared in the official press release.</p>
<p>However, the company is all ready to build and expand in the North American market. There are more than 300 titles that can be readily implemented with online casinos in the region and significantly boost the portfolios of gaming brands that are serious about player retention and engagement.</p>
<p>Some of the games that have been an absolute hit on both sides of the Atlantic include Reactoonz, Tome of Madness, and Book of Dead, among others. Book of Dead itself is the smashing hit that has been dominating casinos in Europe for the past six years, Play’n Go said.</p>
<p>Play’n Go CCO Magnus Olsson was excited about the new opportunities that the North American market may open. He confirmed that he is looking forward to being part of the upcoming G2E which is taking place on October 10 through October 13 and will feature thousands of delegates as hundreds of speakers.</p>
<p>Play’n Go CMO and Co-Founder Ebba Arnred said that there may be still companies that haven’t heard about Play’n Go, but this is just a temporary situation. The company’s mission moving forward is to make its product and name known to the North American market. We previously spoke with Stuart Trigwell, Head of Sales for Western Europe, who very much confirmed that the future of Play’n Go will be inextricably linked to the US and North America.</p>
