<p>The move fully utilizes the group’s cutting-edge technology, significantly enhancing the customer experience and providing an edge over the competition</p>
<p>Gaming and entertainment giant PENN Entertainment achieved a significant milestone by successfully migrating its Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino brand to its proprietary online gaming platform. This strategic undertaking marks a vital step in PENN’s digital expansion ambitions, allowing Barstool to better compete with other leading operators.</p>
<p>The Move Went without a Hitch</p>
<p>Barstool announced the planned migration on 7 July, informing customers of an impending 72-hour shutdown. Fortunately for the operator, the transition finished flawlessly across all 16 states where the brand is active, completing a significant milestone in the brand’s efforts to achieve technological independence. Barstool regarded the move as a significant achievement, allowing it to better compete with industry heavyweights like FanDuel, BetMGM, and DraftKings.</p>
<p>Despite the inconveniences related to the temporary shutdown, Barstool was confident the results would justify the downtime. The new platform offers a user-friendly interface, intuitive navigation, and improved features that cater to online gaming enthusiasts’ evolving needs and preferences. Head of Penn Interactive, Benjie Levy, congratulated the team on their achievement, expressing optimism for the company’s future.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud of our Interactive team who stepped up to the challenge to execute this complex project on time and with minimal disruption to customers. Benjie Levy, head of Penn Interactive, president &amp; COO of theScore</p>
<p>According to Levy, the migration would grant PENN’s in-house team complete control of all operations and product development, elevating Barstool’s casino experience to a world-class level. The new platform has features specifically designed for the North American market, allowing rapid expansion into new jurisdictions and swift adaptation to changing regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Barstool Can Better Capitalize on New Opportunities</p>
<p>With complete control over the technology and infrastructure, PENN Entertainment can remain flexible, introducing new features, meeting player demands, and staying at the forefront of industry trends. The new proprietary platform provides a solid foundation for Barstool’s digital expansion plans and positions the brand for continued success in the highly competitive online gaming market.</p>
<p>PENN’s continued investments in the Barstool brand hope to bolster its presence across the USA, improving its position in the country’s highly competitive sportsbook market. The group’s consistent Q1 results provide a stable base for expansion, while its Penn Game Studios subsidiary significantly enhanced the company’s technological base. These efforts place Barstool in the perfect position to improve its market share and grasp new expansion opportunities.</p>
<p>Barstool’s migration to its proprietary gaming platform signifies a significant milestone in the operator’s digital journey. The seamless transition will enhance the user experience, allow exclusive features, and expand players’ betting options. With a strong focus on security, reliability, and innovation, PENN Entertainment is well-positioned to drive growth and provide an exceptional online gaming experience for its customers, opening the doors to new and exciting opportunities.</p>
