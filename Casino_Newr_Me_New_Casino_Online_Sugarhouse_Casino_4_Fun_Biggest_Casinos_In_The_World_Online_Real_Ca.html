<p>The business-to-business (B2B) provider and aggregator platform, delivering engaging content for the iGaming industry, REEVO, expanded further the reach of its games via a new partnership with the iGaming solutions provider, Spinoro. Announced recently, the deal will see REEVO's games arrive for Spinoro customers. The collaboration will help expand REEVO's global footprint, while at the same time boosting the offering of the iGaming solutions provider.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the partnership, Spinoro's Game Hub will gain access to a portfolio of games provided by REEVO that include table as well as slots games. As a result, clients of the operator will be able to tap into fan favorites such as Diamond Luck and Reel Fortune.</p>
<p>Additionally, Spinoro will be able to deliver Treasures God and Mayan Magic Gold, among other recently released titles from REEVO. The content partnership encompasses upcoming releases, including Spinnerix &amp; Winnerix: The Magic Potion and Le Bo$$u: Richesse Royale.</p>
<p>Jeff Letlat, Spinoro's COO, shared his excitement about the new content deal with REEVO in a statement explaining that the company is delighted to join forces with the popular iGaming developer. "This will expand our games' offerings and will improve the interaction between our clients and our product," he added. Finally, Letlat said: "This partnership is a step forward in our mission to provide players with the most engaging and immersive gaming experience possible."</p>
<p>Famous as a leading developer of games, comprehensive solutions and platforms for the online gambling vertical, Spinoro is Anakatech's game vertical. The company's team of experts develops leading B2B solutions, as well as software and games. Spinoro also has a strong presence within the analytics and marketing vertical, providing an innovative and focused approach toward data for its growing client base.</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, was excited about the company's partnership with Spinoro. She said on the topic: "This year has so far seen us integrate and partner with best-in-class brands and providers and Spinoro is no exception, with this agreement seeing our content distributed far and wide across their extensive network of leading operator partners."</p>
<p>The collaboration with Spinoro comes on the heels of another important partnership for REEVO. Recently, the company confirmed it joined forces with Evolution, the globally-recognized gaming giant. Thanks to that deal, REEVO's platform will benefit from Evolution's leading portfolio of content. Before that, earlier this month, REEVO inked a deal with Booming Games and Pariplay.</p>
