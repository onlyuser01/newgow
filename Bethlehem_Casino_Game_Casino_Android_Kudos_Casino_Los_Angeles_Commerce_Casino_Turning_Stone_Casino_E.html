    <h1>Bethlehem Casino Game Casino Android Kudos Casino Los Angeles Commerce Casino Turning Stone Casino E</h1>

<p>Issue happened on the 18/01/2022 5pm-7pm</p>
<p>Hi, I recieved an offer by whats app by "Justin" the casino account mannager, he offfered me 100 spins for 20 euro deposit, i deposited</p>
<p>and used his offer and won 10 euro in the 100 free spins, I mannaged to run it up to 370 when wagering was completed.</p>
<p>At the moment my ballance was deducted 300 euros, I promptly contacted chat and I was told that it was a sticky bonus and to consult section 6 of their terms and conditions, their T&amp;cs state "The maximum withdrawal limit for no-deposit free spins is €50, $50, AU$75, C$75, NZ$75, 500 kr, 250 zł, R$300, 6,000JPY".</p>
<p>As far as I can see this is this does not apply to me as I "deposited" to get this offer and I see no other terms which tie me to a stickey bonus.</p>
<p>Further more I was given no information that this Bonus was "stickey"and chat was less than clear when I pointed this out.</p>
<p>Any help in this regard is greatly appreciated.</p>
