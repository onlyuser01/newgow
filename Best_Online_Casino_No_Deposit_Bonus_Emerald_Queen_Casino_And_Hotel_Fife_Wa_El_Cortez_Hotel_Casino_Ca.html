    <h1>Best Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Emerald Queen Casino And Hotel Fife Wa El Cortez Hotel Casino Ca</h1>

<p>I hit a $35,000 jackpot on one of the slots. EveryGame has a $2500 withdrawal limit every two weeks so I went ahead and requested the withdrawal. After days of waiting, they declined my withdrawal and took the entire jackpot away because "I redeposited winnings."</p>
<p>I’m sure there were some winnings in my balance that I used to pay for spins but I have also been consistently depositing my own money as well. I don’t understand how this is an issue. I played through the necessary wager.</p>
<p>The problem is that I received a bonus with the redeposited winnings, not just that I redeposited winnings. They are claiming I won this with an illegitimate bonus. However, they gave me the bonus and they deny bonuses a lot if you aren’t eligible for them so I guess I didn’t realize that I used "redeposited winnings." Another thing is that I didn’t even win this with the said bonus, it was gone hours before and I won the jackpot on my wallet, not the bonus wallet.</p>
<p>There’s your general wallet that you deposit funds into and then your chips (casino wallet). I think that they’re claiming I sold chips and then took that money from my wallet and repurchased chips so that I could get a bonus. My wallet has newly deposited funds, old deposits, and winnings all in one. Just to note, the only reason I keep money in there is because it takes minutes to deposit and takes like 2 weeks to withdraw, so I'm not going to withdraw until there's an amount that's worth it to me. I also use the two wallets things to keep myself responsible, so I buy chips for only the amount that I want to gamble and I sell some chips if I win so that I am always keeping some amount of my winnings to the side. Hope that makes sense, not trying to break any rules or game the bonuses by "redepositing." Just trying to be practical but I think that's what they're holding against me. I always play with this system and never a problem until I won a big amount.</p>
