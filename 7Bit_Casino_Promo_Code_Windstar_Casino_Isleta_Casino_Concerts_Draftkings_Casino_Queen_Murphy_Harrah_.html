    <h1>7Bit Casino Promo Code Windstar Casino Isleta Casino Concerts Draftkings Casino Queen Murphy Harrah</h1>

<p>Casinogurus support me on this. I got a email from silveredge casino to signup and I'll get a 300 free chip with code fresh300. I signed up using the link in the email but on the website upon registration I'm forced to type code 300free and I played it out. Try register you will see what I mean but it totally curbs you away from using the coupon you were supposed to use by email and by clicking on the link to signup or at least automatically redeem it for you on signup. But i was like hang on‚Åâ the email invitation I got clearly said I must play with coupon fresh300 so I typed it in and it worked and completed playthrough.</p>
<p>Though I played with the website registration bonus code 300free, I don't think it should count against me cos I was was told directly on email to use fresh300 which they failed to update on the website. The values are the same but that's it</p>
