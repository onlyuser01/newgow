<p>The new name, site and logo reflect the company’s ambition to modernize its products, COO Yahale Meltzer said</p>
<p>Groove, an iGaming platform and aggregator, has launched a new site, sporting a refreshed logo and color scheme. Now rebranded as Groove Technologies, the company will use groovetech.com as its official domain.</p>
<p>As first announced by European Gaming, the rebranded Groove will show off its tech capabilities and new solutions. The company is certain that its solutions will help its partnering operators improve their business and succeed.</p>
<p>The first thing groovetech.com visitors will notice is the new logo. Instead of the old yellow design, Groove Technologies now sports a sleek purple logo. The company’s entire site looks completely different from its old one and is now easier to navigate by visitors.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Groove Tech has reorganized its brand. Groove will now serve as its commercial brand. Meanwhile, GroovePlay will be the company’s aggregation division. Finally, the supplier unveiled GrooveOn, which is a new turnkey service.</p>
<p>Groove Offers Everything Operators Need</p>
<p>Over the last seven years, Groove has formed partnerships with more than a hundred content partners, cementing itself as a major platform. Its team will continue to refine the company’s service division with the goal of introducing intuitive tech that can maximize casino ROI for its partners. To that end, Groove Tech will leverage its upgraded tech stack and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Groove Tech offers robust back-office solutions that can be seamlessly integrated into casino brands, helping them differentiate their products from the competition. This includes tournaments and free spins, which can be quickly deployed, helping operators engage their customers in no time. Groove Tech’s smart-data-enabled back-office allows its partners to reliably gather data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Groove Tech is developing a new AI lobby that will be easy to navigate and will offer many opportunities to discover new content.</p>
<p>Groove boasts a rich library of games from best-in-class studios. Its aggregation platform adds around 100 new games each month, including lottery content, bingo, sports betting and casino titles. Groove also has a proprietary studio called GrooveStudio which produces exclusive content for the company’s partners.</p>
<p>Meltzer Praised the New Look</p>
<p>Groove’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Yahale Meltzer, said that the new logo reflects his company’s drive for modernization. He added that the creativity of the company’s new look is “vitally underpinned” by innovation in its tech platform.</p>
<p>We are a bigger company with bigger ambitions and we look forward to seeing the fruits of this brand and technology refresh as a driver of further growth. Yahale Meltzer, COO, Groove Tech</p>
