    <h1>Prism Casino Login Dubuque Casino Island View Casino Resort Gulfport Ms Tiverton Casino Hotel Niagra</h1>

<p>A new law firm targeting the gaming industry was founded by the former director of licensing at the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) Susan Hensel and her former colleague attorney Joseph Grad.</p>
<p>Gaming-Related Services</p>
<p>Their boutique law firm Hensel Grad PC will look to provide gaming-related services to a wide range of domestic and international clients, including operators, manufacturers of equipment, suppliers of technology and services, investors, and others.</p>
<p>“We believe the time is right for a law firm with a solid understanding of how US gaming regulation is created, implemented and enforced.” Susan Hensel</p>
<p>The boutique law firm would also look to act as a consultant for other jurisdictions nationwide and globally which face the challenges related to gambling regulatory regimes, as both Susan Hensel and Joseph Grad were involved with the development of the licensing regulatory framework in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“…have the knowledge, experience and relationships necessary to serve all of a client’s regulatory needs and believe a boutique law firm is the ideal platform from which to deliver the highest quality gaming law services to clients.” Susan Hensel</p>
<p>Regulatory Experience and Industry Legal Practice</p>
<p>Hensel, who was the first PGCB employee back in 2005 and then became the first director of licensing at the regulatory body, stepped down from the position last month. She boasts a wealth of regulatory experience being tasked with oversight of the licensing process for over 100,000 businesses and individuals during her tenure, while the Pennsylvania market was growing and evolving to become the second largest in the US.</p>
<p>Joseph Grad, who also ran his own legal practice offering services in gaming, corporate and healthcare and has experience in advising state gaming authorities, with the most recent one being the Sports Betting Working Group in Colorado, was one of the first attorneys hired at the PGCB. During his 5-year stay from 2005 to 2010, Grad performed as assistant chief counsel and special counsel for corporate finance and governance.</p>
<p>Grad noted that their firm would gladly partner with any company willing to enter a jurisdiction, starting from the moment the entry decision was made and all the way to achieving compliance with licensing requirements, helping them navigate the US gaming landscape. He confirmed the boutique law firm would focus on advising new or recent entrants to the US market.</p>
