<p>Famous iGaming content and software provider CT Interactive announced that its games have gone live with NetBet in Italy. The operator is well-established in the country and has been continuously growing its presence.</p>
<p>Operating for years, NetBet has solidified its leadership position with its supreme customer service and diverse gaming portfolio. Now, Italian customers of the operator will benefit from further engaging experiences by tapping into CT Interactive's portfolio of content.</p>
<p>Thanks to the launch, NetBet expands further its offering and delivers new games for customers in the country. At the same time, the deal helps expand the reach of CT Interactive's content to new audiences.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 27, 2023, a representative for NetBet noted: "As our company keeps growing, we want to make sure that we offer the most exciting and interesting from the world of slots." Finally, the operator's representative said: "I am happy to say that we found all of these components in CT Interactive’s portfolio. They provide very intriguing games with great designs."</p>
<p>The recent launch marked an exciting moment for CT Interactive as well. The company's Head of CRM, Silvia Hristova, added: "Our company is very proud to announce that our products are live on the website of NetBet – one of the most famous and experienced operators in Italy."</p>
<p>She explained that going live with the operator in Italy enables CT Interactive to reach new audiences. In conclusion, Hristova pointed out: "We look forward to growing our partnership with them and supplying them with more games in the future."</p>

<p>Upon announcing the collaboration, CT Interactive's Head of Business Development EMEA, Milena Tsankarska, acknowledged that GrooveGaming has a strong reputation within the gambling sector with its leading content and platforms.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in March, CT Interactive inked another deal, helping the company expand its European presence.
