    <h1>Oyo Hotel Casino East Tropicana Avenue Las Vegas Nv Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa Rancho Mirage Ho</h1>

<p>Dear OsoMami,</p>
<p>I've engaged in a conversation with the casino team, delving into various aspects of the matter. While I understand the casino team's standpoint that your winnings, stemming from a no-deposit bonus, significantly exceed the typical maximum win amount offered by casinos for such bonuses, and considering the possibility of a phrasing error in the initial bonus terms. It's crucial to emphasize that, at the time you gained your winnings, the bonus description explicitly stated "No Max Cash Out," and you adhered to all the rules without any wrongdoing, and that made us believe that you should receive your winnings in full.</p>
<p>Despite subsequent changes to the terms, retroactively applying these modifications appears unfair. I made efforts to convey our perspective to the casino team, however, they maintained their position, asserting that you've already received the maximum amount, and their decision is final. Unfortunately, the casino team ceased responding to my inquiries, leaving us with no alternative but to categorize this complaint as unresolved.</p>
<p>I understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in the rating caused by unresolved complaints could help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to react, we will reopen the complaint and you will be notified by email. Since the casino operates without a valid license and doesn't refer to any ADR service, there is no gaming authority to turn to.</p>
<p>I can only strongly recommend you choose casinos by their reviews and ratings in the future to avoid situations like this. I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
