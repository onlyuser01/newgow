    <h1>Delaware Casino Oregon Coast Casinos Nyc Casino Blue Chip Casino Hotel In Michigan City Portsmouth V</h1>

<p>NuxGame, a company that specializes in the provision of dedicated casino software and betting platforms has signed a new content alliance with a dedicated game studio</p>
<p>The partnership concerns Barbara Bang, a prominent iGaming developer, which is going out of their way to produce innovative products that will strike home with NuxGame’s own portfolio of operators and partners.</p>
<p>Barbara Bang Gets Access to Hundreds of Casinos</p>
<p>NuxGame is constantly on the lookout to add new studios that can help strengthen not just its overall technical platform, but also add variety in terms of innovative, future-proof, and out-of-the-box games.</p>
<p>Barbara Bang will provide NuxGame with a range of such titles developed in-house, including Sunshine Rich, Chieftain Buffalo, and Juicy Fruits. NuxGame welcomed the opportunity to welcome yet another prominent supplier in its ranks with company CRO and business development Dmitry Volkov praising Barbara Bang for its high quality of games.</p>
<p>He added that the supplier providers a variety of entertainment tools and builds content that appeals to gamers. The goal is, Volkov said, to build and distribute content that is aligned with customer expectations – which requires diversification and expansion of the existing NuxGame library.</p>
<p>Barbara Bang head of partnerships Ahikam Raviv was pleased with the opportunity to work with NuxGame and see the studio gain access to more operators and meaningful distribution channels. He hailed NuxGame as a great platform provider with an established footprint that would undoubtedly benefit the studio.</p>
<p>NuxGame Continues to Add Powerful Solutions to Platform</p>
<p>NuxGame has made a particular point of pursuing some of the best suppliers in the iGaming industry. Recently, the company agreed to a new partnership with an equally acclaimed and praised supplier in the face of RubyPlay.</p>
<p>Apart from strengthening its content library, NuxGame has been keen to offer its partner casinos new opportunities through the addition of advanced technological solutions. One such is the recent addition of a new multi-balance feature that allows players at partner casinos to deposit, play, and withdraw with different currencies without any friction.</p>
