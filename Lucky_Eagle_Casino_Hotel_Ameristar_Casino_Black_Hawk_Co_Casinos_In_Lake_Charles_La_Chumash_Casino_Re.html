<p>The gambling regulator in Malta, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), issued a statement warning about gambling operators that offer their services to customers illegally.</p>
<p>Illegal Operators Offer Services to Customers in Malta</p>
<p>Last week Friday, the MGA warned the public about nearly two dozen websites that operate illegally. Among the domains of the websites can be found multiple different variations of the Australian casino, 24pokies. The MGA acknowledged that the listed 18 websites do not have a license to operate in the country which is in breach of the current gambling legislation.</p>
<p>“The MGA would like to remind consumers not to utilize services provided by an entity unless they have ascertained that the entity in question is authorized to provide such services by the MGA. The gaming regulatory framework obliges authorized persons to comply with strict legal requirements in the interest of consumers,“ explains the gambling regulator</p>
<p>What’s more, the MGA urged the public not to engage with operators that are not authorized to offer their services. According to the gambling regulator, the current regulatory framework is developed in such a way to ensure the protection of the consumers. The Authority reiterated that engaging with unlicensed regulators poses risks to the consumers as such operators do not comply with the existing gambling laws. To ensure an operator is licensed to offer its services in Malta, online customers can visit the MGA’s official website and access a full list of licensed operators.</p>
<p>“The activities of unlicensed entities are unregulated and do not provide the necessary safeguards delineated by virtue of the framework, making transactions with such entities risky for consumers,“ added the MGA</p>
<p>Consumers that use licensed operators benefit from being protected by the current gambling laws in the country. This is because each licensed operator agrees to abide by the specific regulations which also safeguard the well-being of the users. While licensed operators abide by the laws, this is not the case for some illegal, offshore operators. Such black market operators may refuse to pay winnings or market misleading bonuses or promotions, which can have a negative impact on consumers.</p>
