    <h1>Casino Online No Deposit Bonus Parx Casino Shippensburg Temporary Casino Chicago Durant Casino Kwata</h1>

<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I'm having problems receiving my payout of 1700 euros at 1red.com.</p>
<p>I am a regular customer at 1red, fully verified, have already had withdrawals there and won well 2 days ago and requested a withdrawal of 1700 euros.</p>
<p>2 weeks before I had a withdrawal of 500 euros there and strangely enough there was</p>
<p>There were technical problems and my withdrawal was rejected about 6-7 times.</p>
<p>I was then helped in the support chat and the employee called the 1red finance department to solve the problem. After about 20 minutes the money arrived.</p>
<p>But now all I hear from 1red Casino is that I should wait and be patient.</p>
<p>After 2 days, as a regular customer, you can expect that my withdrawal will be approved because I played without a bonus and won, what else do you want to check after 2 days other than</p>
<p>Click on Accept Payout.</p>
<p>After 2 days in the chat they still say I should be patient and they apologize</p>
<p>for the long delay in my payment.</p>
<p>A few times I asked in the support chat there and the same ready-made answers always appear in the support chat at 1red, be patient, apologize 1000 times blah blah etc.</p>
<p>As a comparison, at VerdeCasino, if I play there every now and then and pay out something, a payout via bank takes about 8 hours without any problems.</p>
<p>I've always received my payouts from 1red, so far so good, but what's going on with them now, this stalling tactic, is it necessary to scare away regular customers?</p>
<p>10 months ago my withdrawals there only took a few hours and now? By simply</p>
<p>Catastrophe.</p>
<p>I don't have any problems with the fact that it can sometimes take a little longer because of the high volume of payouts etc. it's just the scam that's going on with them that's annoying.</p>
<p>I ask for help so that I can receive my payment.</p>
