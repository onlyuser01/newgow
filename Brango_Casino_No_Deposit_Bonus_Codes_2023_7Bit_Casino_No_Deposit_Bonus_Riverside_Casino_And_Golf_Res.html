<p>The Washington Huskies (#5) are coming to Reser Stadium to take on their Pac-12 rivals, the Oregon State Beavers (#11)</p>
<p>The Washington Huskies are 10-0 in the 2023 NCAAF season and are determined to stay undefeated until the end of the season. Theyâ€™re left with only two games to play before the end, the first of which is against the Oregon State Beavers who are 8-2 right now.</p>
<p>Although the Huskies have a much more illustrious history than the Beavers, the recent couple of duels between these two were pretty close. In fact, the last time they met, the Huskies won by just three points. Further, the last time a Washington vs. Oregon State duel took place at Reser Stadium, the home team won.</p>

<p>Washington Huskies Wanna Keep on Winning</p>
<p>The Huskies are 10-0 on the season and itâ€™s mostly thanks to their incredible offense. These guys are averaging 41.0 points per game, which is second only to the Oregon Ducks in the Pac-12 Conference.</p>
<p>Their quarterback Michael Penix Jr. has been great both when it comes to passing and rushing the ball. Heâ€™s thrown for a total of 3,533 yards in the 2023 college football season, with 28 of his passes resulting in a touchdown. Plus, in his last two outings, we saw him score two rushing TDs.</p>

<p>The Huskies, however, havenâ€™t been as impressive defensively. Theyâ€™re conceding 23.5 points per game, which is more than the Oregon State Beavers, as well as four other Pac-12 teams.</p>
<p>Their Achillesâ€™ heel in 2023 has been their defense against ground attacks. The Huskies defense is allowing 140.3 yards per game, which could be a major problem in Week 12 when theyâ€™re taking on Oregon State which averages 196.9 rushing yards per game.</p>
<p>2023 NCAAF Odds Suggest Oregon State Will Win in Week 12</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Huskies did a good job defensively, managing to stop Utahâ€™s runners from doing much. They kept the Pac-12â€™s No.1 rushing offense to just 115 yards. However, that happened on their turf. In Week 12 of the 2023 college football season, theyâ€™re taking on equally dangerous runners on the road.</p>
<p>The Oregon State Beavers are great on the ground with running back Damien Martinez being their standout player. Theyâ€™ve also been doing okay passing-wise, but itâ€™s their defense thatâ€™s been truly stellar in 2023.</p>
<p>These guys are conceding 20.5 points per game, which makes their defense the fourth-best in the conference. Whatâ€™s really impressive about this team, however, is that the Beavers have conceded under 20 points in six games this season.</p>
<p>Bookies seem to think they got what it takes to stop Penix Jr. &amp; the Huskies offense on Saturday, giving them shorter NCAAF Week 12 odds. However, the odds arenâ€™t miles apart, suggesting that weâ€™re going to see a real battle at Reser Stadium.</p>
<p>Washington Huskies vs. Oregon State Beavers Prediction</p>
<p>This is going to be a very close game in our opinion as each team has the tools to exploit the other teamâ€™s weaknesses. The alternative point spread is set to 3.5 points, which is great because we donâ€™t think either team can win by more than a field goal.</p>
<p>And if we had to pick which team is going to leave Reser Stadium victorious? Weâ€™d go with the Huskies, mainly because their QB Penix Jr. is playing at a Heisman Trophy level.</p>
<p>Pick: Washington Huskies +3.5</p>
