    <h1>Wynn Casinos Hollywood Casino Kansas City Casinos In Iowa Casino In Mississippi Casinos In Southern</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>I know that 99% of the time I don't have a chance with my complaint. Nevertheless, it is very important to me to put up a topic for discussion that will certainly also be of interest to many other players.</p>
<p>It is about whether online casinos are allowed to accept players from Switzerland or not. The legal situation in Switzerland has been as follows since January 1, 2019. It is not illegal for players to gamble at overseas casinos. But he has been banned from offering games in Switzerland without a license since January 1, 2019. Gambling is not permitted and illegal in Switzerland for providers without a license. I know that many casinos write in their terms that it is the player's sole responsibility to find out about the legal situation. I think that's wrong. It cannot be that the responsibility is transferred to the player and the casino violates applicable laws. A country's law still prevails over the terms and conditions of an online casino. I'm sure you agree with me here.</p>
<p>Many terms and conditions state that the user is responsible for checking the legal situation and whether playing is allowed. But especially in the case of Switzerland it is more complicated. The electorate has approved a law that bans gambling in Switzerland without a license for foreign casinos.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is illegal to offer gambling in Switzerland and for Swiss people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not illegal to gamble in foreign casinos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The casino is blacklisted by the Swiss judiciary (Zugangssperren (admin.ch).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also interesting why it is not possible to create an account from Switzerland in hundreds of other casinos.</p>
<p>In this sense, I have not made myself liable to prosecution and have not violated the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Most casinos (including Amok Casinos) have a black list of countries you cannot play from. Simple question: why is Switzerland not on this list?</p>
<p>After the amendment of the gambling law on January 1, 2019, the MGA sued Switzerland and was not successful. They are still not allowed to offer any games in Switzerland without a license.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I would like to ask you to clarify the situation and to claim back my losses since January 1st, 2019.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
