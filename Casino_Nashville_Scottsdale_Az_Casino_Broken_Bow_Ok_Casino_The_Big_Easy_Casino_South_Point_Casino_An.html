    <h1>Casino Nashville Scottsdale Az Casino Broken Bow Ok Casino The Big Easy Casino South Point Casino An</h1>

<p>I registered at the casino. Made a deposit and got a promotion which was 40 no wager fs. 8 fs for 5 days. So i claimed the spins once i had deposited. And then i opened the game as was told the game is no able to work because of my jurisdiction. I contacted support and was give a R100 as good gesture from the casino and was told a ticket was opened with a reference no. I played and wont but i can never withdraw my funds. I contacted my bank and i sent the documents to the casino. A document explaining what to do for my bank to accept the payment. But that never worked. After about 100 withdraws been failed. I eventually played the money out. Upon my funds being depleted i get a email saying when i made anotjer deposit they can pay my funds out and the so. I think thats unfair. I have emails and support chats. Please help</p>
<p>I am going to need a email address so i can fprward these emails to you.</p>
