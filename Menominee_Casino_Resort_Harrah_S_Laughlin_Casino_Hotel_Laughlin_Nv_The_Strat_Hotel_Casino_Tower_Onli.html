<p>Ohio Casinos Post September Revenue Record, Gaming Win Totals $164M</p>

<p>Ohio casinos and racinos combined to win more than $164 million last month, which marks a new September record for the state’s gaming industry.</p>

<p>Ohio’s four commercial casinos, which feature slot machines and table games, reported gross gaming revenue (GGR) of $71.9 million. Slots generated $50.8 million, and tables $21.9 million. The state’s seven racinos — which only feature video gaming terminals (VGTs) — won $92.7 million.</p>
<p>The Cleveland market fared well. MGM Northfield Park won $19.9 million (up 2.9 percent), JACK Cleveland $18.1 million (up 5.3 percent), and JACK Thistledown $14.2 million (up 20.8 percent).</p>
<p>Legalized gambling in the Buckeye State dates back to 2012, and last month was the best September ever for the state casino industry.</p>
<p>Casino September GGR</p>
<p>MGM Northfield Park $19.9M Hollywood Columbus $19.3M Hollywood Toledo $18.9M JACK Cleveland $18.1M Eldorado Scioto Downs $16M Hard Rock Cincinnati $15.6M JACK Thistledown $14.2M Miami Valley $14M Hollywood Mahoning $11M Hollywood Dayton $10.7M Belterra Park $6.9M</p>
<p>The GGR data is provided by the Ohio Lottery Commission and Ohio Casino Control Commission, the latter which regulates the four casinos (JACK Cleveland, Hard Rock, and Hollywood Toledo/Columbus).</p>
<p>Pandemic Demand</p>
<p>Ohio casinos were closed throughout April and May, but began welcoming back gamblers in June. COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, including a 50 percent capacity limit.</p>
<p>Poker is still off-limits, as are live events and concerts. Employees must wear face masks, but patrons are only urged to do so, not required.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations and regulations, guests are gambling at higher rates than ever experienced in Ohio.</p>
<p>September’s all-time best performance is the third consecutive record monthly performance. Ohio casinos and racinos won $172.1 million in August and $181.1 million in July.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Odds</p>
<p>The line on Ohio lawmakers passing a sports betting bill has shortened in recent months. Ohio borders five states, and only Kentucky doesn’t permit legal sports betting. Sportsbooks are operational in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Gaming industry analysts believe the Ohio market would be huge for oddsmakers.</p>
<p>We estimate that Ohio is the sixth-ranked US state in terms of sports fandom, and the seventh-ranked state in terms of college football fandom,” says Eilers &amp; Krejcik, a leading gaming industry analytical firm.</p>
<p>Ohio lawmakers are mulling an eight percent tax on revenue stemming from sports betting. Projections are upwards of $600 million a year in new gaming revenue, should that tax rate be implemented and mobile wagering is allowed.</p>
<p>Ohio is a sports-obsessed state. It is home to eight professional sports franchises, and eight NCAA Division I FBS college football teams, most notably the Ohio State Buckeyes. The Cleveland Browns are 3-1 for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Sports betting proponents, however, received a bit of a disappointment this week when state Sen. John Eklund (R-Lake County), the main sponsor of a sports betting bill, said details remain that need hashing out before the General Assembly will proceed with a vote.</p>
