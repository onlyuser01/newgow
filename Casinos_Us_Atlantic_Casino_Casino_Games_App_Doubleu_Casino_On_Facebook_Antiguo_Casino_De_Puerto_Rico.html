<p>We've thoroughly reviewed Cashback Casino and gave it an Above average Safety Index. It's generally a good casino to play at, but there are some things worth noting. In our review, we've considered the casino's player complaints, estimated revenues, license, games genuineness, customer support quality, fairness of terms and conditions, withdrawal and win limits, and other factors. Because Cashback Casino is related to other online casinos listed below, its rating is also influenced by them.

<p>According to our research and estimates, Cashback Casino is a smaller online casino revenue-wise. It's part of a group of related casinos. However, this group is still quite small even when evaluated as a whole. The revenue of a casino is an important factor, as bigger casinos shouldn't have any issues paying out big wins, while smaller casinos could potentially struggle if you manage to win really big.</p>
<p>We haven't found any complaints directly about this casino, but we have one complaint about a related casino in our database. Because of this complaint, we've given this casino 30 black points. You can find more information about the complaint and black points in the 'Safety Index explained' part of this review.</p>
<p>Warning: Cashback Casino has certain sections of Terms and Conditions that we consider to be unfair to the casino's players. Because of this, we advise you to look for a casino with fair rules or at least pay special attention to this casino's Terms and Conditions if you decide to play at it.</p>
<p>Cashback Casino has an Above average Safety Index. We've given it this rating because we think it's doing many things well, however, there is something holding it back from getting an even higher rating from us. Even despite that, you can expect this casino to be a good place to play at.</p>
