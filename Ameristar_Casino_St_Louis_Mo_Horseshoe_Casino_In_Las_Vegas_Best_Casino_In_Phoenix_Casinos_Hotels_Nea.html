    <h1>Ameristar Casino St Louis Mo Horseshoe Casino In Las Vegas Best Casino In Phoenix Casinos Hotels Nea</h1>

<p>In January 2022 I won $1,800 playing slots at Royal Ace Casino. I submitted all the required documentation and the casino staff would not pay my winnings as they were requesting 3 months of my banking statements. I refuse to disclose my private banking information and then they suggested that I get the withdrawal via cryptocurrency. I opened a cryptocurrency account and supplied them with my cryptocurrency address to receive my winnings. It was one excuse after another during chat or when I emailed them. They said to give them more time to send my money. Finally in April 2022 I received $700 in cryptocurrency. When I inquired about the remaining funds that were owed to me they kept giving me excuse after excuse after excuse. Then they sent me $100 in cryptocurrency instead of the remaining balance of $900 after their fees. Again I had to reach out to them through chat and email because they do not have a working phone number and all I got was lies, deflection, and ultimately have been completely ignored. I asked Royce to give me the transaction details of the remaining funds that they claimed that they sent me in f u l l and I would be able to cross reference the crypto address that it was coming from. Royal Ace refused to show me the transaction details because they didn't send my money and they know that they don't have the transaction details so I have just been completely ignored. I have the transaction details of what they sent me. Basically Royal Ace Casino is a scam Casino stealing from the gamblers who entrusted them and they should be blacklisted and held accountable for their unscrupulous business practices. I am determined to get the word out about Royal Ace Casino so that some other person doesn't get ripped off and given the run around then completely ignored as they go on taking other gamblers money not paying out winnings. I am so disgusted with royal Ace Casino and I hope that this complaint that I can back up with emails transaction details, I hope Royal Ace is held accountable. I understand they are out of Costa Rica and after being ripped off I learned that other people have been ripped off as well. There must be something we can do to stop Royal Ace from their thieving lying conniving business practices. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.</p>
