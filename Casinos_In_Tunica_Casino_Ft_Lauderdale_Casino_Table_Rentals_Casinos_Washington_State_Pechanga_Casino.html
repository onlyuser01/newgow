<p>The authority promised to take self-reported companies in mind when meeting out administrative decisions</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has asked unlicensed operators to self-report their activity. This refers to companies that hold a license in European jurisdictions but are not licensed by the MGA. The regulator implied that it might be much more lenient to companies that decide to come forward.</p>
<p>MGA Asks Unlicensed Operators to Come Forward</p>
<p>As outlined in Regulation 22 of the Gaming Authorizations Regulations (S.L. 583.05), all entities that offer licensable games either in or from Malta and do not possess a license to do so should contact the authority.</p>
<p>The MGA pointed out that its appeal concerns companies that are licensed in a country that is a member state of the European Union or is a part of the European Economic Area. The appeal also concerns any operators that might offer customer safeguards that correspond to Maltese standards.</p>
<p>Such companies should apply for a recognition notice, the MGA concluded, basically asking companies to apply for a license if they are to continue offering their products in or from Malta.</p>
<p>The Operator Will Keep Self-Reported Companies in Mind</p>
<p>Gambling operators have until April 14 this year to comply with this call and self-report their activities. The MGA expects such companies to come forward and detail their administrative non-compliance.</p>
<p>The regulator concluded that it will make sure to be less harsh toward companies that have self-reported their unlicensed activities when taking action against unlicensed gambling.</p>
<p>The Authority shall consider this act of disclosure when meeting out any ensuing administrative decision in this regard. MGA statement</p>
<p>The MGA noted that any entities wishing to learn more about the self-reporting scheme should contact the regulator. Unlicensed companies seeking to open a new page can connect with the MGA and learn more about the process by contacting the authority at [email protected].</p>
<p>In other Malta-related news, the regulator introduced changes to its Player Protection Directive a month ago. The MGA based the amendments on feedback received through a dedicated consultation process and required licensed companies to monitor markers of harm.</p>
<p>In short, the MGA wants companies to keep track of their players’ behavior and intervene when a customer exhibits signs of problem gambling. Tracking suspicious activity may also help the MGA prevent monetary fraud such as money laundering.</p>
<p>The changes came into power on January 12, 2023. The move demonstrated the authority’s dedication to safe and responsible gambling and, according to the announcement, paved the way for further framework updates and improvements.</p>
