<p>IGT has signed a new partnership with Qullqi SAC through which the company will deploy its Floor Manager systems and tech to the latter’s casino properties in Peru. The partnership covers seven casinos that are currently operated by Qullqi SAC.</p>
<p>Qullqi SAC Casinos Get a Boost in Peru</p>
<p>This agreement will cover the following properties specifically – Casino Macao and Casino Montecarlo based in Loreto. The partnership will also provide Casino Gambinos Paita and Casino Masaris Paita in Piura, and Casino La Torre De Babel in Ica.</p>
<p>Not least, the partnership will also provide systems to Casino Carrusel and Casino Crystal Palace in Lima. The agreement was welcomed by Ricardo Mustafa, the general manager of Qullqi SAC. He said:</p>
<p>Qullqi is honored to be the first operator in Peru to leverage IGT’s Floor Manager system technology, the most advanced game delivery system in the market.</p>
<p>He assured that the Floor Manager solutions provided to the operator will help players experience a much more holistic and rewarding gaming floor designed for adults. This technology will further assist with Qullqi SAC’s regional growth plans and ambitions.</p>
<p>The company and its properties will similarly receive access to a number of IGT slots, updates, and game upgrades, providing players with “maximum agility” and freedom to choose titles they are happy with. Understandably, the solution will also feature an analytics toolkit and visuals to make it easier for Qullqi SAC to track performance and make decisions based on data.</p>
<p>IGT SVP of Canada, South and Central America for Gaming David Flinn welcomed this opportunity and said that Qullqi only stands to benefit from this “strategic decision.” Flinn was confident that the rollout of the technology will provide the operator with real-time and high-performing solutions captured not just by IGT’s dedicated gaming library but also owing to the analytics tools that will guide the operator’s decision in making better business decisions.</p>
<p>Strategic Choice Set to Pay Off</p>
<p>Flinn assured that the company was already prepared to serve and cater to regional needs and preferences in Peru having done extensive research with its “Reactive Peru by IGT” initiative which is only going to pay bigger dividends as IGT continues to expand in the area with trusted and worthwhile partners such as Qullqi.</p>
<p>IGT has been busy of late, with the company announcing that it will roll out self-serve terminals with the Ontario Lottery Corporation in 2023, among other major deals around the globe.</p>
