<p>Benfica is one of the best home teams in the world, which is why bookies are giving shorter odds on the Portuguese than on the visitors from Italy. The hosts are priced at +120, but their UCL odds keep shortening. To see whether there’s value in backing the Eagles, keep on reading!</p>

<p>Estadio da Luz Crowd to Carry the Eagles on Tuesday</p>
<p>The Eagles are flying high when playing on their turf, especially in big games like the one that’s scheduled for Tuesday. The last time they played a Champions League game at Estadio da Luz, we saw them demolish Club Brugge 5-1.</p>
<p>Further, in the group stage of the competition, they went 2-1-0 at home, with wins over Juventus and Maccabi Haifa, and a draw with PSG.</p>
<p>They’re dominant at home, but that wouldn’t be possible if they didn’t have some really good players on the roster. In fact, their squad looks amazing in 2023, with a very long bench. Even though they work great as a collective, the Eagles do have a couple of standout players.</p>
<p>Goncalo Ramos is their best scorer this season with 25 goals in 37 games in all competitions. Still, their best player overall is Joao Mario, who’s not just been scoring a lot, but also recording plenty of assists. Speaking of Mario, he’s an ex-Inter Milan player who’s probably very eager to get revenge over his former club.</p>
<p>Inter Milan Hoping to Put an End to a Poor Run</p>
<p>I Nerazzurri did start the year in a good shape, but their form has been abysmal over the last couple of weeks. Scoring has been their main problem, which is kind of surprising given the fact that they got some really good strikers on the roster – Edin Dzeko, Romelu Lukaku, and Lautaro Martinez.</p>
<p>Their defense has been alright, allowing no more than two goals since October. The last time they conceded three goals in a game was against Barcelona on the road in a Champions League game.</p>
<p>Benfica vs. Inter Milan Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Milan will probably do okay in the defense, but their offense is bound to struggle. It’s not just because their strikers are out of shape but also because they probably won’t have the ball in their possession too often. Benfica’s players are almost guaranteed to be the ones to dominate Tuesday’s game. Our Benfica vs. Inter prediction is that the hosts are going to win, but probably by a small margin.</p>
<p>Pick: Benfica to win &amp; under 2.5 goals</p>
