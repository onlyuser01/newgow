<p>Оnline casino and sports betting company Rush Street Interactive has released its BetRivers online sports betting brand to bettors in the state of Arizona.</p>
<p>BetRivers Launches in Arizona</p>
<p>Arizonian adults can now sign up to the platform and access BetRivers’ diverse betting offerings. Local punters can access thousands of players, matches, and leagues with a press of a button, using the sportsbook’s mobile betting application.</p>
<p>The content has been made convenient and user-friendly with the inclusion of a stats center, live broadcasts, game trackers, betting tips, and other quality-of-life betting solutions.</p>
<p>The chief executive officer of Rush Street Interactive, Richard Schwartz, spoke on the launch of BetRivers in the state of Arizona. He revealed that his company is thrilled to have its industry-leading platform expand to new markets and become available to bettors in Arizona.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive’s entry in Arizona was set up in advance. In August, the company inked a multi-year market access deal with the Arizona Rattlers team from the Arena League Football. This helped RSI secure a license even before the Arizona sports betting market had officially launched.</p>
<p>Because of that, Schwartz thanked the Arizona Rattlers and the state’s Department of Gaming for the trust they placed in RSI. The CEO concluded that he is “looking forward to delivering responsible, player-first entertainment to enthusiasts across the state.”</p>
<p>RSI recently partnered with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation for launch in the state. The operator also expanded to the Canadian market with its Casino4Fun brand.</p>
<p>Arizona’s Fresh Market Continues Attracting Operators</p>
<p>Arizona officially launched its sports betting market at the beginning of September, right in time for the renowned National Football League. Many powerhouses in the betting sector realized the potential of the Arizona betting market and flooded the state.</p>
<p>Major names in gambling quickly secured licenses for operations in the state. Some of them included BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, and Penn National, followed by WynnBET and others.</p>
<p>Despite the great interest from commercial betting companies, some of the tribal bodies weren’t as thrilled by the launch of sports betting in the state. The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe proved to be one of the main opponents of launching sports betting in Arizona. The tribe argued that the process of legalizing sports betting was in breach of the local laws. The Yavapai-Prescott also added that it would hurt the tribal economy.</p>
<p>Still, despite the opposition from the tribe, Arizona sports betting is alive and kicking with more betting companies like Rush Street Interactive showing interest in establishing operations in the state.</p>
