    <h1>Casino Del Sol Tucson Arizona Morongo Casino Resort Spa Jack S Casino Downtown Cleveland Sandia Reso</h1>

<p>Hello: I withdrawn the amount of 600 euros on day 1 and they processed me on day 4, but the money does not arrive. They sent me an email a certain Hervé saying that in 2 days I would have the money in my bank account because they had sent me a transfer. 5 days have passed and the money has not arrived, they never answer the emails and I have already written 10 or 12 times, in the chat they tell you that it will come to me and they hang up.</p>
<p>After reading in Guru the discussions of this casino I think that it is indeed a casino that scams and does not pay.</p>
<p>A Wire (transfer) child can take 5 days when I gave them my IBAN and SWIFT.</p>
<p>I will have to write off the 600 euros but I want you to take good note so that these people do not cheat anyone else</p>
<p>A casino that does not even reply to any email is clear that it is a bad casino, but if it does not pay, it is also clear that it is a scam casino.</p>
<p>I have the screen of when they processed the withdrawal of the € 600</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
