<p>The new partnership with the award-winning games studio will expand QTech Games' offering, bringing a portfolio of quality skill and fast games</p>
<p>The leading distributor of games across Asia, QTech Games, announced it forged a new content partnership with Galaxsys, the award-winning provider of games for the online gambling sector. Details regarding the new partnership emerged Friday and saw QTech Games go live with content from the award-winning gaming studio. Under the terms of the new collaboration, content from Galaxsys will be integrated into QTech’s platform, allowing the studio to reach new audiences in emerging markets.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that this partnership will significantly expand the reach of Galaxsys’ games. This will enable the studio’s engaging and innovative games to engage with new players, delivering elevated excitement and thrill. At the same time, the collaboration reaffirms QTech’s growing position as a leading provider of content for the Asian iGaming sector. Ultimately, the partnership with Galaxsys complements QTech’s goal to become the largest provider of digital entertainment for the region by 2025.</p>
<p>Currently, Galaxsys’ extensive portfolio is recognized for its high quality and engaging features. The company offers more than 20 fast and skill games that are certified in a range of markets. It was back in 2021 when Galaxsys was founded and started making huge waves within the iGaming vertical. The innovative games studio holds multiple awards, including the Fast Games Provider of the Year from the SiGMA Europe Awards, among others.</p>
<p>Back in August, QTech Games announced another important content agreement. At the time, the company confirmed it extended its content library with the addition of crash games and instant-win titles from Turbo Games.</p>
<p>New Alliance Expected to Bring Mutual Benefits</p>
<p>Daniel Long, QTech Games’ chief commercial officer, was excited to see the company join forces with Galaxsys. He said QTech Games is delighted to expand its offering with the addition of quality games from the multi-award-winning iGaming content provider. Long praised the quality of Galaxsys titles, especially its hit crash game, Rocketon.</p>
<p>He added: “By combining video-game-level visuals with the latest math models for improved gameplay and varying volatility where needed, it is one of the pioneers in bringing this fresh format of risk to the digital gaming space.” Finally, Long said that the company is looking forward to seeing how the engaging and quality games will be received by players around the world.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to witness how these games perform across a range of untapped markets, which, in many cases, represent new territories for Galaxsys.“ Daniel Long, chief commercial officer at QTech Games</p>
<p>Gil Soffer, Galaxsys’ sales and business senior vice-president, was similarly thrilled to see the company forge the new content alliance with QTech Games. He said that the company is delighted to team up with the leading game distributor for the Asian region. Finally, Soffer predicted that the collaboration would bring mutual benefits.</p>
