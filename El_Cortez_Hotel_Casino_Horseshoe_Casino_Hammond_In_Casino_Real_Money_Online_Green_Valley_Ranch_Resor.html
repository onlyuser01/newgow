    <h1>El Cortez Hotel Casino Horseshoe Casino Hammond In Casino Real Money Online Green Valley Ranch Resor</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru,</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I are registered by Dutch law as having the same status as married people do. We are together for over 20 years, we bought a house together, we have three children and we share everything except the same surname. This includes bank accounts registered on our own names.</p>
<p>My girlfriend created an account at N1 Casino and I deposited the money (only € 20). We played every night for a couple of hours, we cleared the wager and our balance reached about € 200. We decided to withdraw € 50 and play on with the rest. We uploaded the required documents including the address proof and ID of my girlfriend and the proof of deposit from my bank account. Instead of paying out the money N1 Casino took our whole balance. My girlfriend received the following email:</p>
<p>Dear friend,</p>
<p>Informing you that we found out that you have used the 3rd party payment system. Using the 3rd party payment systems is prohibited. You must make deposits only from a bank account, bank cards, e-wallets or other payment methods that are registered in your own name.</p>
<p>Due to that violation we confiscated your winnings.</p>
<p>N1 casino did not only confiscate our winnings as stated but also confiscated the money we deposited. We tried to explain how our relation is and asked how we can get our account activated again/how we can get our balance back. We can prove everything we stated. We get no response via mail and received only copy pasted standard answers in chat stating: "violation + decision is final"</p>
<p>By the Dutch law we share everything including bank accounts. We offered to proof that, but N1 Casino is not interested.</p>
<p>We really would like Casino Guru to help us with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could you help us/mediate in getting our full balance back?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if not, could you have N1 Casino to transfer the deposit of € 20 back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently N1 Casino can accept deposits without any restrictions and/or verification. In the withdrawal phase it is completely the opposite. Probably this is legally possible but not fair or ethical in most people's standards (sore loser). We learned this the hard way. What we don’t understand and find totally unacceptable is why N1 Casino does not transfer back what is left of the deposit money and terminate the account in case of violation of their terms. We feel like N1 Casino is stealing our money.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>M&amp;D</p>
