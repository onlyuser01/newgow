<p>For Barcelona, this is a must-win game. With a victory over Eintracht on Thursday, Barca would get to the semifinal of the 2021-22 Europa League, which is the competition these guys are determined to win.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why winning the Europa League is so important for Barca, it’s because that’s their best chance to get ahold of a trophy in 2022. The trouble is that getting past Eintracht could be more challenging than initially expected. At least that’s the impression we got after their first duel.</p>
<p>As a reminder, last week, the two played 1-1. Barca was the pre-match favorite, but Eintracht was the better team for most of the game, making way more goal chances than its opposition. The most impressive thing is that Eintracht played with ten men on the pitch in the final 15+ minutes of the game.</p>

<p>Barcelona Desperate for a Win</p>
<p>Barcelona got to the Europa League after failing to qualify for the knockout phase of the Champions League. This team finished third in its UCL group, failing to advance to the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Barca also ended its Copa Del Rey journey too soon. Despite being one of the favorites to win the Spanish Cup, Barca got knocked out of the competition by Athletic Bilbao in the Round of 16.</p>
<p>When it comes to Spanish La Liga, Barcelona is currently in second place, but with only a tiny chance of getting to the top. It’s because the table-leader Real Madrid has a significant point advantage.</p>
<p>What all this means is that practically the only way for Barcelona to win a trophy this season is to win the Europa League. But they’re still far away from the title. Their first step is to get past Eintracht, for which they need to win on Thursday.</p>
<p>Barcelona players have the motivation to win, but do they have the quality? Sure, they do – they’re one of the best squads on the continent. The trouble is that Eintracht isn’t too bad either.</p>
<p>Eintracht to Fight Back</p>
<p>The German team was pretty impressive in the first leg, making 16 goals attempts against Barcelona. In comparison, Barca’s players created just seven chances.</p>
<p>What’s even more impressive is that Eintracht played with one player fewer than Barcelona from the 78th minute until the ref’s final whistle. It’s because their defender Tuta got sent off for roughing one of Barca’s players.</p>
<p>Eintracht showed they got what it takes to keep up with Barca. However, this Thursday, they’re playing on the road. Although they’re decent in away games – 3 wins, 2 draws, and 1 loss in 2022 – Barca is even better when playing at home.</p>
<p>Barcelona vs Eintracht Frankfurt Prediction</p>
<p>Barca is without a loss at Camp Nou this year, with four wins and two draws. The teams Xavi’s boys defeated since the beginning of the year include such soccer giants as Atletico Madrid and Sevilla. That said, they surely have what it takes to beat Eintracht as well.</p>
<p>Barca might win, but you can be sure Eintracht will not surrender without a fight. Instead, we will probably see the German team attacking with all they got – especially if Barca scores first.</p>
<p>Picks: Barcelona to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
