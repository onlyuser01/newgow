<p>Family and friends of the three victims left dead at the Stateline Casino on the border of Montana and North Dakota marked an anniversary of the tragic event this weekend.</p>
<p>Roll Back One Year</p>
<p>On November 6, 2021, deputies responded to a reported shooting at the casino on the border of Montana and North Dakota, and upon arrival discovered three people diseased, including the shooter, according to the report provided by Roosevelt County Sheriff Jason Frederick.</p>
<p>Two days later, Frederick told media that the shooting was the result of a domestic dispute between a man and his wife and a second man from Bainville and the dispute turned into a double murder-suicide. He also added that the case was considered close and no further investigation would be conducted.</p>
<p>According to surveillance footage from the parking lot of the casino, there was a quarrel between Bradford Mann, 56, and Scot Panasuk, 63, immediately after both men got out of their vehicles. Apparently, Mann had followed Panasuk to Colby’s Casino looking for answers.</p>
<p>Moments later, Mann took out a gun, shot Panasuk and then turned the gun towards his wife, Jennifer Mann, 49, who was sitting in the car and shot her dead. In the end, he pointed the gun at himself and committed suicide.</p>
<p>The Sheriff also said that examinations on the bodies of the victims were conducted and all evidence collected from the crime scene was processed. He added that Mann, who is from Williston, North Dakota, and Panasuk, who is from the small town of Bainville, Montana, knew each other.</p>
<p>Following the shootings, both Stateline Casino and Colby’s Casino remained temporarily closed to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<p>Situated about 300 miles from Billings in northeast Montana near the border with North Dakota, the small town of Bainville dramatically increased its population over the past decade following fracking operations in the Baaken oil fields.</p>
<p>Mourning the Losses</p>
<p>Following the days after the double homicide-suicide event, friends and families of the victims were recalling fond memories of the Mann family, sending prayers out for the wellbeing of their kids. Their recollections were gathered and published online by the funeral home.</p>
<p>Those mourning the loss of Panasuk expressed their grief in his obituary, outlining his great human qualities and contribution to the community.</p>
