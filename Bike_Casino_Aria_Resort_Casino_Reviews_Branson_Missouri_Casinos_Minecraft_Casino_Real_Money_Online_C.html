    <h1>Bike Casino Aria Resort Casino Reviews Branson Missouri Casinos Minecraft Casino Real Money Online C</h1>

<p>Hello casinoguru,</p>
<p>I’m extremly worried im not going to recieve my winnings on wizebets. Ive been very lucky the past couple of days and managed to get €77200 with a €1100 deposit.</p>
<p>Ive made several withdrawal requests. Now im aware of the withdrawal limits and im 100% sure that i did not exceed them. Now ive recieved an email 5 days later of my initial withdrawal request that ive exceeded the daily limit. And that i should try a lower number.</p>
<p>ive attached some files and ive made the withdrawal request of €4950. Now some time later on the same day i requested another withdrawal of €4975. I recieved an email like 10mins later that i exceeded the daily limit which is correct. So then ive waited 24 hours for my next withdrawal of €5000 and they didnt respond to that. So i thought weekly limit is 10k so im now below that. And today both withdrawals got cancelled due to exceeding daily limits…</p>
<p>Why would they first kind of approve them because if you exceed you almost immediatly get an email that you exceeded. And now 5 days later my ‘vip’ manager all of the sudden cancels my withdrawals.</p>
<p>thats when i started to get worried..</p>
<p>i made a new withdrawal request today of €3950 and later cancelled my €1150 withdrawal because inwas worried for the same thing (exceeding daily limit)</p>
<p>I just dont have a good feeling right now and i would like some help with this. Because its way to much money..</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>
