<p>BetMGM continues to expand its reach in the iGaming market by putting down more effort into delivering a better experience to its customers. Part of this commitment is the introduction of a brand new live dealer studio in Michigan, which will help the property raise its profile and strike home with online players in the Great Lake State.</p>
<p>BetMGM Doubles Down on Live Casino Products</p>
<p>This is a continuation of the company’s already established live product portfolio in the state. BetMGM first launched a dedicated live casino studio offer in the state in 2021 and has been actively working to expand on this offer. Now, the company is leveraging its bon rapport with Evolution, the preeminent supplier of live casino products, to create fresh opportunities for players.</p>
<p>As interest in live casino gaming is skyrocketing, MGM Resorts focuses on its digital brands being trendsetters rather than trend-followers. The studio is branded in the company’s distinct black and gold colors and features the marquee Golden Lion logo.</p>
<p>BetMGM presently accounts for 39% of the market share in Michigan, but it wants to make sure that its casino offering continues to raise the bar for competitors and secures an even bigger chunk of the market. BetMGM director of gaming Oliver Barlett commented on this opportunity:</p>
<p>This beautiful, new studio enhances BetMGM’s live casino experience in Michigan and deepens our partnership with Evolution. BetMGM director of gaming Oliver Barlett</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has the visibility and brand awareness to create a truly memorable product, Barlett believes, citing the existing intellectual property as one of its biggest assets. “We’re confident that it will amplify our market-leading casino offering in Michigan,” stated.</p>
<p>Evolution and BetMGM Build on Strong Partnerships</p>
<p>Besides, BetMGM and Evolution have been working since Day 1 together as the supplier has helped the operator find its way in the Great Lakes States. Evolution commercial director for North America Jeff Millar confirmed that his company is thrilled to be working side by side with BetMGM once again.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled that BetMGM has again entrusted Evolution with providing a full dedicated studio solution, powered by our technology. Evolution commercial director for North America Jeff Millar</p>
<p>Evolution added that the BetMGM live studio is one of the “grandest” properties they have developed for the purposes of elevating the live casino experience. It’s an opportunity to strengthen BetMGM’s own offer and expertise, as well as the established ties between the two companies.</p>
<p>The ultimate winners here are the customers who will immerse themselves in the distinct live and worthwhile games brought on by the Evolution and BetMGM brand.</p>
