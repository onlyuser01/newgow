<p>Jennifer Aument, who has over 25 years of experience in infrastructure development, delivery, and operations, is subject to regulatory pre-approvals before her appointment is confirmed</p>
<p>Aristocrat Leisure Limited, the Australian gaming and gambling company, has announced the nomination of Jennifer Aument as its new non-executive director.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Welcomes Jennifer Aument to Board, Cites Strong Infrastructure and Digital Tech Skills</p>
<p>Jennifer Aument’s previous leadership roles in large US and Australian infrastructure companies, including her recent role as global transportation chief executive at AECOM, has positioned her well for this new role. She also previously served as president and CEO of Transurban’s North American business, as well as holding public affairs and government relations leadership positions at Bechtel Infrastructure and other firms.</p>
<p>In addition to her infrastructure expertise, Aument has also demonstrated a strong understanding of consumer digital technology and government relations. She currently sits on advisory boards for Cornell University and the Eno Center for Transportation, and previously served on the board of commissioners for the Virginia Port Authority.</p>
<p>Neil Chatfield, Chairman of Aristocrat, expressed his delight in welcoming Jennifer Aument to the board: “Jennifer has a particular understanding of US and Australian environments, the complexities of supply chains and the delivery of major projects, and is a thought leader in the use of consumer digital technology. Jennifer also brings strong government relations and public affairs capabilities. Jennifer is an impressive, people-oriented business leader, with a track record of active community engagement.”</p>
<p>Pending regulatory pre-approval, Aument will be referred to as director (elect). Upon confirmation, she will be appointed as a director of Aristocrat Leisure Limited. Aument, who currently resides in Virginia, US, is expected to make a significant contribution to the company’s ongoing success.</p>
<p>Anaxi Strikes Multiple Strategic Partnerships in Online Gambling Industry</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s Anaxi has been keeping busy with strategic partnerships in the online gambling industry. In mid-February, the company teamed up with BetMGM to enhance its online casino offerings. BetMGM sought to leverage Anaxi’s creative expertise to create a top-notch player experience. This was just one of Anaxi’s partnerships, however.</p>
<p>Another partnership was announced in early March with Caesars Sportsbook and Casino. Anaxi aimed to provide a premium player experience across the globe for this well-known operator. Caesars, which competes with FanDuel in many states, now offers Anaxi’s content in its Caesars Casino Library.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of March Anaxi announced its partnership with FanDuel, allowing players in West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Connecticut to access new Anaxi content on the platform. FanDuel’s online casino now offers Aristocrat’s games, including Dolphin Treasure and Wild Ameri’coins. Anaxi’s iGaming products target the US market, but the company also has an international presence through content studios and partnerships, such as Roxor Gaming, which Aristocrat recently acquired.</p>
