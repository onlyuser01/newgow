<p>Fluffy Favourites review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fluffy Favourites has a somewhat split personality. In the background is a big top tent and a wide-open field. On the reels are a batch of soft toys and the occasional claw out of a shopping mall grabber machine. The connection between these two images is, presumably, that sometimes you find such machines at the circus and at fairs.</p>
<p>The heart of the machine is the stuffed toys rather than the setting. These adorable fluffy favourites of the title are rendered in a children's story art style that makes them hard not to love.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are similarly two toned. On the one hand is the crude digital drawing of the background and on the other are the painstakingly drawn watercolour toys on the reels.</p>
<p>The rest of the game has a kind of primary colour, kindergarten feel to it. The animations are simple blinking lines to show wins and the spinning of the reels.</p>
<p>The action has no musical accompaniment except for some drums while the reel spins and the win and spin sounds are standard audio calqued from other slots in Eyecon’s line up.</p>
<p>Player can change betting options of number of winlines together with the usual betting options</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fluffy Favourites consists of a five reel slot with three rows and twenty five win lines.</p>
<p>The game has a picking bonus and a free spin bonus, as well as a gamble feature that allows you to play double or nothing with your winnings. The gamble feature does not always appear in the game.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Three or more Wilds anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>The Free Spin bonus starts with five free spins per Wild in the triggering spin. A multiplier of three is applied to all winnings during the Free Spin bonus.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more of the Scatter symbol triggers a picking game in which the player is awarded one pick per symbol on the triggering spin. The player picks items, each of which has a randomly assigned multiplier on it. The winnings are then calculated as the player's bet on the triggering spin times the multiplier.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.30%, comfortably coming in at below average (our yardstick for average is roughly 96%).</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.01 if you play just one line, up to a maximum of $/£/€15.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a very weak match for our preferred slot machine strategies.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Fluffy Favourites slot</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Fluffy Favourites is not a very engaging slot. The artwork is slapdash and inconsistent, the sound effects dull and jarring, and the gameplay plain and uninteresting.</p>
<p>However, the biggest turn off for us is the low return to player. At 0.7 percentage points under the approximate average return to player, Fluffy Favourites is far from being one of our favourites, or even getting a recommendation.</p>
