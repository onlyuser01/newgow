<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming has confirmed that its flagship Fanatics Sportsbook brand has added another state to the list of jurisdictions where the company’s sports wagering products are now available in Virginia, the United States.</p>
<p>The company is in good standing to bring local players a variety of betting markets and betting options, as well as a powerful mobile-powered and user-centric gaming experience that is bolstered by iOS and Android compatibility.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after the acquisition of PointsBet assets which has now led to a migration of PointsBet users to the dedicated Fanatics Sportsbook app. The account balances, username, passwords, and rewards, as well as RG settings, are automatically transferred to the Fanatics Sportsbook, but consumers still need to download their dedicated app.</p>
<p>However, users will still be able to access their accounts using the same login details, as specified in the official press release by the company. The logic of this new rollout follows the previous launch of operations which happened last week in neighboring West Virginia.</p>
<p>What was interesting then and now is that Fanatics Sportsbook is not only going to be limited to the sports wagering requirement and it’s indeed planning to push forward with a dedicated iGaming product in those states that regulated the vertical.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fanatics is promising some exquisite rewards in Virginia, where players can benefit from the Rewards Surge campaign which will offer great bonuses and betting options for players over the Thanksgiving holiday and weekend.</p>
<p>Fanatics wants to make sure that its sportsbook is immediately recognizable and feels familiar to players. It offers an optimized search that the company hopes will make it much easier for players to find the events, leagues, and markets they are after, and it also features live streaming powered by Genius Sports Limited to ensure that the in-play betting options are on-point right from the start.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company is fully committed to Responsible Gambling and will seek to make the most of the experience by providing consumers with the necessary safeguards to play smartly and reasonably. The two back-to-back launches are hardly the only ones that are coming as the assimilation of PointsBet puts Fanatics in a very good position.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local, and established betting giants, such as Caesars, BetMGM, DraftKings and FanDuel,are looking at both Fanatics and also ESPN BET’s operations and planning their next move.</p>
