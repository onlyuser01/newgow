<p>Run Amuck review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed around a mad scientist’s lab.</p>
<p>Immediately, players will discover petri dishes filled with adorable goopy creatures. The colourful little characters have been brought to life by strange experiments.</p>
<p>Players will have to pour mysterious substances together and cross their fingers that they get the combinations right. They may just create a whole host of slime friends as they play.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The background music is a cheerful series of sci-fi chimes and beeps. This creates a quirky atmosphere and sets the mood to do daring chemistry experiments.</p>
<p>Hitting 'spin' prompts a satisfying sliding sound that makes it feel as though players are combining odd ingredients.</p>
<p>Players have the option to mute only the music or only the gameplay sound effects so they can curate the experience they most enjoy.</p>
<p>The stars of this game are the endearingly cute goo creatures. Made of glimmering slime in bright shades of blue, orange, green and fuscia pink, they look out from the reels with friendly expressions. Players will be keen to spin just to see what irresistible creature appears next.</p>
<p>The setting of the game is a whimsical cartoon lab, complete flasks of bubbling liquid and gleaming pipes. Players will have no doubt they have entered the workspace of an eccentric scientist.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a great atmosphere that’s fun to visit.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Run Amuck is a seven reel, seven row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing clusters of 4 or more matching symbols (connected either vertically or horizontally).</p>
<p>Upon wins, the clusters collapse together to combine into symbols that take up as few positions as possible.</p>
<p>After this combining, the other symbols on the reels vanish and new symbols appear to take their place. The process repeats until no new combinations can be formed.</p>
<p>The pace of the gameplay is lively and captivating. Players will have no trouble staying engaged with this one.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol, but there is a Bonus symbol which initiates Free Spins.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when the Bonus symbol lands 3 times (awarded 8 free games), or 4 times (awarding 30 free games).</p>
<p>The Bonus symbol will only land on the bottom left, bottom right, top left, and top right positions.</p>
<p>While in the Free Spins feature, a special set of reels are used, and players begin with a select number of watching symbols on the reels.</p>
<p>Free Spins rounds play at the same bet as the game was initiated on.</p>
