    <h1>Mgm National Harbor Casino Lake Tahoe Casinos Map Waterfront Casino Lahug Casino Near Gatlinburg Tn</h1>

<p>Forward to me said "proof" to my email beysslennard@gmail.com . In my complaint about another casino operated by the same group they are also providing "proof" I had allegedly created multiple accounts under the same email and username on one casino, however their logic is flawed. On my winnerama complaint they are saying I have multiple accounts with the same username and the same email on their casino however it is impossible to create two accounts with the same email and username as you woul get a "username already taken / email already used" error message which proves the accounts are not on the same casino, but accounts on different casinos operated by the same group. The reason it would show up as multiple accounts is because they likely share the same database for all of their casinos and I repeat I have one account per casino, one on Luckydraw, one on winnerame and one on Tangiers. Which I have registered days apart. Please Show me the rule that says it is prohibited to create a new account on a different casino, are you supposed to play only one casino for the rest of your life? even you who is working on this ticket Im sure you are registered on multiple different casinos. I dare you to create two accounts with all the same info (username /email) on Luckydraw im betting it will not work. Which proves they are being deceptive and I have not broken any rules</p>
