    <h1>Wildwood Casino Casino By Niagara Falls Atmore Al Casino Playlive Casino Cast Of Casino Royale 1967</h1>

<p>Dear Lucy casino management,</p>
<p>firstly I would like to thank you to firstly acknowledge me as I was never sent an email to be updated or even explained the situation.</p>
<p>I actually played from the Uk and Use a vpn which is not forbidden in your casino actually adviced unluckily other sites.</p>
<p>I took screenshots where where u site states so.</p>
<p>My previous accounts were under time out and not blackmailed as I was playing lot of money and loosing constantly. Also your site does not forbig the opening of other accounts and since deposits limits are not offered i decided to have time out and when I felt to play again I used another email which not only is not forbidden but highly advised.</p>
<p>When I ask your site to close my account the chat operator say he didn't care if one player couldn't stop playing to just don't play.</p>
<p>Which made me upset as vulnerable players are in danger but u could definitely close my account when i won the money.</p>
<p>I did not use anu software and thats for sure ,I'm not that tech liberally and i did played continuosly this is true and perhaps this is reason i won? If u investigated u will also realised I played over 15k in Uk pounds, one can lose but can one loose forever?</p>
<p>I'm 100% sure i did not do anything else than play costanttly, which it worked fine for your casino till u were gaining my money bit now it seems to be a problem once i won? the jackpot were won in 3 differenti times, once when i first open my account and after I actually won a small jackpot I lost all the money, all of it, the last two times I must admit when I won the two jackpot in such close time I was amazed and surprised as and simply thought after all the money spent on your site and the hours I playeda God must have helped me.</p>
<p>I did not use a software and this is a fact ,the game provider verified that and im not friend of them,i could have said the same when i lost constantly and i could have thought the games qere rigged.</p>
<p>Regarding the coinbase account im not sure why the close my account as I have used coinbase for years and also used it for gambling but in all truth I was over one year i didn't gamble so not sure they changed the rules on gambling, and I honesty thought since the casino had not license that they probable closed it because of the and even asked u if that could be the case.</p>
<p>You said u have not reason to believe I don't come from the uk, I have not issues to send u a proof of that, I have nothing to hide and if u need a proof of my passport I can provide that.</p>
<p>I have played so much money in your site and lost it all and now because I have won ,for once in my life a big amount I have to pass for an hakker or gang?</p>
<p>I am not , the money i have played were from my saving ,it all comes from one single bank account, unfortunately mine.</p>
<p>I truly hope you will pay the winnings as I did follow all the rules on your site, and if the slot I played was generous for whatever reason is not my fault, I do not have skills or a criminal mind to create that as if I had this " bug " or software as u call it why would I have won such a small jackpot 2 months ago and not the biggest one?</p>
<p>Btw, when i complained with the casino was because the casino did not offer depsoit limits and u also removed the time out option and u do not allowed allow players to self exlude yourself.</p>
<p>When offering screenshot u should show the whole chat and also I ruthless the chat operators are.</p>
<p>I would advice you to offer time out and also self-exclusion, and since u manager to block my ip u shoudl also off offer that to players of they request it and not tell them to just don't play.</p>
<p>From my side I have a clean conscience as I have simply played over and over and after I have won the second jackpot I increased the bet to the maximum bet which I actually read the t&amp;c before as many casino have hidden rules and I did not find a rule against the amount of time to play and neither maximum for bet.</p>
<p>I ahev lost so much much money at your casino that my drive was to get it back playing it thinking eventually I would have won and I did.</p>
<p>My request of cash out still stand as I am 100% sure im not an haker and not a gang, and I can prove my identity to the casino as I have absolutely nothing to hide.</p>
<p>It is sad as is so easy to make thousand and thousands of pounds in deposits and nobody question you but when is time to pay out u even refuse to belive the game provider which has nothing to do with me as they proved I did not do anything illegal.</p>
<p>Maybe for once luck was on the side of the player and for once on my life that I have own i even have to be called scammer? Not once was questioned when I played and lost all my hard money.</p>
