<p>Oregon gambling laws</p>
<p>Currently, online casino gambling for real money is not legal in the state. Sports betting is live in Oregon but casinos are not covered by the legislation. Instead, no commercial casinos are allowed to operate from the state or target Oregonians. You can access offshore casinos within state lines but this would be treated as unlawful gambling. However, social casinos that operate not-for-profit are allowed to provide free-play games.</p>
<p>Gambling age in Oregon</p>
<p>While online casino gambling is not legislated in the state, there are tribal casinos and you must be 21 or over to enter these venues. This is also true of sportsbooks both online and offline, as well as the state lottery.</p>
<p>Taxes on gambling winnings</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to win at one of the stateâ€™s casinos or sportsbooks, some of your winnings could be taxed above certain thresholds. The Oregon State Lottery imposes an 8% tax on all lottery winnings above $1,500 and this is applied by the state on other winnings, alongside the 24% federal rate. However, as tribal casinos are excluded from tax, there are no specific gambling taxes for winnings at these venues.</p>
<p>Regulation</p>
<p>Online casinos are not currently regulated in Oregon as they are not legally allowed in the state. Instead, any offshore casino that you play at within state lines will not offer you the protections that a regulated casino would.</p>
