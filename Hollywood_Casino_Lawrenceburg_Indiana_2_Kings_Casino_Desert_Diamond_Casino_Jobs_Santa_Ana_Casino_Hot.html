<p>Kane wonâ€™t attend the game against Ajax</p>
<p>Spurs seem tired in their game versus West Ham</p>
<p>Ajax rested and ready to take on the English team in London on Wednesday</p>
<p>Tottenham and Ajax will meet up at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, opening the UEFA Semifinals. Game 1 will have the Spurs host the Dutch guests in what we can only hope to be a spectacular first match played on Wednesday, May 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Ajax UCL Semifinal: The Story So Far</p>
<p>To properly understand the odds and chances of both teams winning, you need to be familiar with the events up to date. Tottenham did exceptionally, knocking Manchester City, the EPLâ€™s most likely winners this year, out of the race with Ajax dominating Juventus. Even more surprisingly, Ajax defeated Real Madrid, signing two landmark victories in their book.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s players did well, winning in terms of away goals versus City for a total aggregate of 4-4. Ajax dismayed the audiences by both showing Juventus the door and defeating Cristiano Ronaldoâ€™s home team with 3-2.</p>
<p>While Tottenham has struggled at home against teams, such as West Ham and even Brighton, UEFA has been another chapter for the team. Erik Ten Hagâ€™s team though, remains strong, and the Spurs must not drop their guard.</p>
<p>Date : Tuesday, April 30</p>
<p>: Tuesday, April 30 Time : 3 p.m. ET</p>
<p>: 3 p.m. ET Location : Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</p>
<p>: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium TV channel : TNT and Univision</p>
<p>: TNT and Univision Moneyline : Hotspur +138 / Ajax + 210</p>
<p>: Hotspur +138 / Ajax + 210 Spread : Hotspur pk, -Â½ +104 / Ajax pk, +Â½ -120</p>
<p>: Hotspur pk, -Â½ +104 / Ajax pk, +Â½ -120 Draw: +215</p>
<p>Ajax will be coming into the game strong with a lot of home talent, such as Frenkie De Jong and Matthjis De Ligt. These players will be joined by Dusan Tadic and David Neres, bringing the offensive power of Ajax to a new high.</p>
<p>One of the knocks on Tottenham at the beginning of the English Premier League (EPL) was that their defense wobbled and shook, and even Pochettino admitted this much. This cannot be the case if Spurs want to win on Wednesday or even draw against Ajax.</p>
<p>Spurs have suffered a first defeat at their new stadium, 1-0 against West Ham.</p>

<p>Tottenham Lose to West Ham â€“ What Does It Mean for Ajax?</p>
<p>Spurs right winger Lucas Moura recently said that he had never doubted his teamâ€™s ability to make it into the Semifinals. However, the recent loss against West Ham revealed a different story. Tired, Spurs didnâ€™t show much initiative against the methodical play of West Ham, conceding a 1-0 defeat in the end.</p>
<p>Will Harry Kane Play?</p>
<p>Tottenham may be criticized as a team that lacks depth, but the the Spurs have three injured players, one of whom will miss out on the game completely:</p>
<p>Harry Kane</p>
<p>Moussa Sissoko</p>
<p>Jan Vertonghen</p>
<p>Even though Sissoko and Vertonghen will be part of the Wednesday game, Kane will not attend, Pochettino revealed. This is a serious blow to Tottenhamâ€™s chances of winning the game.</p>
<p>Given their faltering performance against West Ham, many fans fear that the Spurs wonâ€™t nearly be in as good a form as they need to even contest Ajax. Meanwhile, Kane may even miss the entire season:</p>
<p>Im absolutely gutted that Iâ€™ve needed to have surgery at such a vital point in our season. Weâ€™ve tried everything to avoid this action but Iâ€™m very hopeful that this is not the end of the season for me yet in what has been a great year for the team and me personally #COYS ðŸ’™ â€” Harry Winks (@HarryWinks) April 29, 2019</p>
<p>Ajax Set to Win Another Game</p>
<p>Ajaxâ€™s victory over Juventus and Real Madrid has given them lots of confidence and they seem to be perfectly capable on taking on the Spurs.</p>
<p>Ajax â€“ Tottenham: UCL Stats 2019 Ajax Tottenham 5 Wins 5 4 Draws 2 1 Losses 3 19 Goals 17 159 Total Attempts 147 83% Passing accuracy 85% 54% Possession 50%</p>
<p>Fernando Llorente will probably have to replace Kane on attack, which means Ajax will be able to handle their defense better while constantly applying pressure against their opponents. With just a day to go, we are looking forward to the game between Ajax and the Spurs.</p>
