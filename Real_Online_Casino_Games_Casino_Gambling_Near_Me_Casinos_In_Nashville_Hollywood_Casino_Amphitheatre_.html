    <h1>Real Online Casino Games Casino Gambling Near Me Casinos In Nashville Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre</h1>

<p>Hello, I won € 27,000 at AmunRa Casino in early August. Until then, I deposited with Paysafe cards and then wanted to withdraw via bank transfer in € 1,000 increments, as this was the maximum withdrawal amount. I didn't have to verify myself until then. Then nothing happened at first. After a few days I got in touch with the live chat. There I was put off again and again with the statement that my gaming session had to be checked. After a while all payouts were canceled by the casino except for 3x € 1000. This was justified by the fact that a maximum of three payments can be made at the same time. I was put off with these statements until an email came from support at some point, telling me to verify my account. I emailed all the necessary documents to support on the same day. The whole thing went like this three times, because apparently something was wrong again and again (what exactly was never communicated, only that the documents could not be accepted). About a week ago, my player account was deactivated. When I wrote to chat support again they said my account is currently being verified and the account will remain deactivated until then. Since then I have written to the chat again and again, but am always put off with the fact that I should wait for an email from support, which will get in touch as soon as my account is verified ... as I said, a few days ago and I'm slowly desperate, because I don't get a specific statement and the account is now deactivated and further "evidence preservation" is no longer possible ...</p>
