<p>After a historic three-decade legacy of helping working families within the gaming and hospitality industry in Nevada, Geoconda Argüello-Kline announced her retirement from the Culinary Union.</p>
<p>Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Retires</p>
<p>Geoconda Argüello-Kline was a part of the Culinary Union for 32 years. For the last 10 years, she served the Union as a secretary-treasurer. During her tenure, she helped solidify the Culinary Union’s presence in Nevada. In fact, the Union has supported hundreds of thousands of families over the years. Moreover, thanks to the Union, many families and workers received vital support in the recent pandemic-impacted years.</p>
<p>Last week Friday, the Culinary Union announced that Argüello-Kline will be retiring from the position. Her position will be filled in by Ted Pappageorge, who has served as the Union’s president for the last 10 years. On the other hand, Pappageorge’s position as president will be taken by Diana Valles.</p>
<p>The Union Remains Committed to Protecting Workers</p>
<p>Born and raised in Managua, Nicaragua, Argüello-Kline came to the US back in 1979 as a political refugee. Then, in 1983 she moved to Las Vegas Valley. In 1989, Argüello-Kline was working as a guest room attendant at Fitzgerald’s Hotel but due to contract issues, she helped a picketing campaign outside the property that lasted for 6 months. Remaining focused on helping her family and other workers get better working conditions, she became involved with the Union in 1990.</p>
<p>“There is truly nothing we didn’t try or do in the fight to protect workers, organize, expand benefits, demand our fair share as companies made record profits, elect political leaders who will represent workers, hold elected leaders accountable for their actions or inactions, and champion issues that are important to working families.” Geoconda Argüello-Kline</p>
<p>Argüello-Kline said in a statement that to protect workers, the union has tried everything in its power. Moreover, she acknowledged that for the last 87 years, the Culinary Union has had the same daily priority – to protect the workers. What is more, Argüello-Kline acknowledged that she will always remember the power that the Union has with its arsenal of tools such as picket lines, protests, rallies, strike votes, and more.</p>
<p>“I congratulate my union brother Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge, who I have worked side-by-side with for over 30 years, and my union sister President Diana Valles on their new roles – they will ensure the Culinary Union and members continue to come back stronger than ever.” Geoconda Argüello-Kline</p>
<p>Pappageorge added that thanks to Argüello-Kline’s leadership and years of service, the Union has grown and by now it has 60,000 members. Additionally, he praised her dedication and sacrifice that made the Union and the working families stronger. In conclusion, Pappageorge outlined that he and Valles are “honored to take on these new roles and we will continue the fight to win justice for workers in Nevada.”</p>
