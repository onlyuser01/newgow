<p>The feature from Stakelogic elevates the excitement and thrill, bringing new experiences for players of Relax Gaming's slots</p>
<p>The popular iGaming aggregator and provider of unique casino games, Relax Gaming, announced a new partnership with the innovator and disruptor of the iGaming vertical, Stakelogic. Under the terms of the new deal, Relax Gaming’s renowned slots will be boosted by Stakelogic’s latest innovation for the live casino sector, Super Wheel.</p>
<p>The collaboration will see the bonus wheel supercharge the experience for Relax Gaming’s customers, adding a new level of thrill and excitement via a chance for additional prizes. Ultimately, Super Wheel will power a selection of games from Relax Gaming, elevating the experiences they bring.</p>
<p>The innovative feature can be triggered by players randomly. This takes them to a live casino studio where a host will spin a 54-segment money wheel, granting them a chance for a number of different prizes. Moreover, the engaging feature offers three additional bonus games that are presented via a second studio.</p>
<p>Players that trigger the secondary bonus round of the Super Wheel can benefit from Vegas Diamonds, Vegas Drops and Vegas Hold ‘n’ Spin. According to Relax Gaming, each of the games “offer ample winning opportunities with a minimum return ensured.”</p>
<p>Renowned as a leading provider, Relax Gaming currently offers more than 4,000 online casino games. The iGaming content supplier offers engaging slots, as well as hand-picked third-party studio games thanks to its existing partnerships.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Stakelogic comes on the heels of the release of Titan Strike, a new slot game from Relax Gaming that offers an RTP of 96.09% and features an ancient Greek theme.</p>
<p>Stakelogic, Thrilled to Deliver Super Wheel for Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Stephan van den Oetelaar, Stakelogic’s CEO, was excited about the new partnership with Relax Gaming. He praised the Super Wheel, explaining that this is one of Stakelogic’s products that revolutionize the iGaming sector. “By merging traditional slots with live casino technology an entirely new player experience is being created,” added Stakelogic’s CEO. Last but not least, Oetelaar said that the company is delighted to join forces with Relax Gaming and boost their portfolio with the Super Wheel feature.</p>
<p>“We are excited that Relax Gaming has decided to partner with Stakelogic, and will implement Super Wheel to make its slot games even more successful.“ Stephan van den Oetelaar, CEO at Stakelogic</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s CPO, shared the excitement of Stakelogic’s boss. She explained that this is not the company’s first collaboration with the leading technology provider. According to Hannah, the introduction of the Super Wheel represents the next natural step in the partnership between Relax Gaming and Stakelogic.
