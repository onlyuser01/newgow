<p>Red Rock Resorts (NASDAQ: RRR) has unveiled new renderings of the luxury casino hotel it hopes to build in Henderson, Nev.’s Inspirada community. The Inspirada would fill the same luxury locals niche as the company’s Green Valley Ranch, also in Henderson, and Red Rock Resort in the wealthy Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin.</p>

<p>According to documents filed with the city of Henderson, the proposed project would have about 58,000 square feet of gaming space and a 201-room hotel, down from a December 2022 estimate of 600. Plans for the Inspirada also include three restaurants, a food hall, a movie theater, and a 12-lane bowling alley.</p>
<p>The Henderson Planning Commission is set to consider the Inspirada’s development agreement at its next meeting on November 16. If approved, construction would start on or before Oct. 9, 2029.</p>
<p>Initially, the resort was have been built on 45 acres of land Station Casinos has owned since 2007. In May, the Henderson City Council approved a land-use designation change that increased the size of the project — and of Henderson itself — by nearly 300 acres annexed from the neighboring Eldorado Valley.</p>

<p>Doubling Up</p>
<p>The latest Red Rock casino plan is part of the company’s mission to double its Southern Nevada presence by 2030.</p>
<p>The locals chain plans to open its Durango Casino &amp; Resort in Southwest Las Vegas on December 5, two weeks later than originally planned. Durango will feature 73,000 square feet of gaming space, a sportsbook, 2,000 gaming machines, and 40 table games.</p>
<p>Red Rock recently opened the Wildfire Fremont Casino in downtown Las Vegas on the site of the former Showboat/Castaways Hotel and Casino, which it purchased and then demolished in 2004.</p>
<p>Last year, Red Rock purchased 67 acres in North Las Vegas for $55 million after receiving approvals for a new 75,000-square-foot casino and 600-room hotel on the site.</p>
<p>Also last year, the company purchased 126 acres south of the Las Vegas Strip for $172 million, boosting its unused land holdings in the region to nearly 430 acres.</p>
<p>In addition to the Red Rock Resort and Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock Resorts currently operates multiple gaming properties under the Station Casinos brand throughout the Las Vegas area. The company also runs 10 Wildfire casinos, including seven in Henderson.</p>
