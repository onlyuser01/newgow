<p>The global gaming company, International Game Technology (IGT), announced a new partnership, allowing it to further expand the reach of its leading technology. On Thursday, the company revealed it joined forces with Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, a casino operator for the market in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new multi-year deal, IGT agreed to power the operator's retail and mobile sports betting offering, delivering its award-winning technology, IGT PlaySports. Besides leveraging IGT's leading technology, the casino operator located in Ponce will also collaborate with the company's experienced trading advisory services team. Ultimately, the new partnership will see IGT power PlayBets by Ponce Plaza, Puerto Rico's first casino brand-led mobile and retail sportsbook.</p>
<p>In a statement, Joe Asher, IGT's President of Sports Betting, commented on the topic saying: "IGT PlaySports looks forward to helping Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino deliver the excitement of multi-channel sports betting to fans in the region through our proven technology and comprehensive services."</p>
<p>He highlighted the importance of delivering sports betting services for the operator. Finally, Asher predicted that Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino will be equipped with tools that would enable it to acquire new customers, propelling its growth and expansion.</p>
<p>Ramon Muñoz, Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino's General Manager, was also excited about the freshly minted agreement with IGT. "IGT has been a valued Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino gaming equipment supplier for many years, and we are thrilled to expand our strategic alliance and entertainment portfolio with PlayBets by Ponce Plaza, our soon-to-launch IGT PlaySports-powered sportsbook," he explained.</p>
<p>Finally, Muñoz pointed out: "Ponce Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino has been serving the local community since 2008 and we could not be prouder to be the first casino operator in Puerto Rico to run and operate its own sportsbook and to give sports fans an amazing betting experience backed by a local operator who they know and trust."</p>
<p>Recently, IGT announced it signed a new deal with the Kentucky Lottery. Announced late last month, the duo extended their contract for 13 more years. This collaboration helped strengthen IGT's presence in Kentucky, ensuring that the Lottery will benefit from its services through 2036.</p>
<p>As a leading provider of solutions and technology for the global gaming industry, IGT's IGT PlaySports currently powers the operations of nearly 100 gaming establishments across North America. Earlier this year, the leading technology that is a part of IGT PlayDigital, was recognized by the SBC North America Awards. At the time, the company secured the "Sportsbook Supplier of the Year" from the 2023 edition of the awards.</p>
