<p>The leading company powering mobile-first responsible payment solutions and digital payments for the global entertainment, leisure and gaming industries, OKTO, announced a new collaboration with the famous Romanian land-based operator GSbet. The new collaboration, announced Monday sees the operator leverage OKTO's leading mobile-first responsible payments solution for its complete retail network.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest collaboration, 3,000 GSbet self-service terminals within 1,100 different locations will benefit from responsible gaming experiences. Moreover, the collaboration delivers OKTO's cashless solutions which brings further innovation to the growing market in the region.</p>
<p>GSBet's owner and CEO, Gheorghe Sorin, shared his excitement in a statement released on December 12, 2022. He acknowledged that the new deal with OKTO represents a milestone moment for the GSbet.</p>
<p>Sorin added that the new collaboration will significantly transform the retail vertical by bringing digital payment experiences. Finally, he revealed: "Our mission is to offer our customers the best experiences and by partnering with OKTO, we further proceed in this direction."</p>
<p>Liviu Popovici, OKTO's Country Representative, added: "We are pleased with our partnership with GSbet, launching digital, secure payment experiences in an extremely significant and substantial market." He explained that GSbet is among the operators that understood the importance of digital payments.</p>
<p>Popovici said that digital payments can help operators by delivering a convenient payment alternative for the customers, but at the same time, said that those payments can help propel operators to their next phase of growth and tap into "fast-forward in-store digital transformation."</p>
<p>Additionally, the company's Country Representative confirmed that the quick roll-out of its solution is a testament to how seamless the technology is for both the online and retail verticals. Popovici did not miss saying that OKTO's payment solution also complies with the regulations of the jurisdiction where it is deployed.</p>
<p>Focusing on OKTO.Wallet, Popovici said that it "not only satisfies the digital demands of modern consumers but also satisfies the requirements set out by regulators in terms of safer gambling and proper supervision of self-service facilities, being suitable for all progressive businesses in the sector."</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes after OKTO recently inked a similar agreement. Back in October, the company forged a new partnership with Light &amp; Wonder. Under the terms of the deal, OKTO agreed to provide its leading cashless solutions powering the operator's gaming machines.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier this year, OKTO inked an important partnership with the Hippodrome Casino, the biggest and busiest casino in London. This collaboration saw the venue tap into OKTO.WALLET as a payment method.</p>
