<p>Wilds of Fortune Slot Review</p>
<p>Wilds of Fortune from Betsoft Gaming is a fruit-themed “one-armed-bandit” slot game launched in July 2022. Instead of sticking to the classic elements of the popular fruity slots that have been released by many other studios over the years, Betsoft decided to give Wilds of Fortune a cool twist with the help of a series of modern-day features including guaranteed wins in free repsins and instant payouts from three scatter combinations.</p>
<p>We have explored all of them along with the paytable, graphics, sounds, animations, and gameplay, and compiled this comprehensive online slot review for you. Read on to find out more about the 5×3 video slot that invites players to enjoy a relaxed and soothing experience while giving them the opportunity to win up to 500X the bet.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Get Ready to Be Spoiled!</p>
<p>Players will feel right at home sitting in front of the exciting slot machine, sipping on delicious refreshment drinks, and letting the soothing jazz music dictate their mood. This is the first-hand experience new players are prone to discover there. The simplicity of the theme and storyline automatically induces a state of familiarity and being at ease with the game.</p>
<p>The game is charming on its own through its classic fruit theme which is a constant reminder of the old-school classic slot machines. The backdrop itself showcases the image of a casino floor with entire rows of slots dispersed on both sides. The overall style of the design also has plenty of retro elements to it. The symbols have been carefully picked to remind players of old slot machines back in the day. Fans of classic slot games can expect to be spoiled with the numerous fruit, golden bell, melons, grapes, and lucky 7 symbols on the 5×3 grid that will immediately generate a laid-back, almost reminiscent experience for players. The money bag and diamond symbols that have been selected as scatters and wilds nicely complement the rest of the symbols and contribute to the formation of bigger wins for a more reading overall experience.</p>
<p>Wilds of Fortune: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>To create a winning combination, players need to match three of five identical symbols. The game pats both left to right and right to left. Wins formed with five identical symbols only pay left to right.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols are represented by the classic cherry and grape symbols that pay 25x the bet for matching five identical symbols. The mid-paying symbols are the melon and the bell which reward players with wins of 40x, and 50x for the same five-of-a-kind types of combinations.</p>
<p>Matching five single BAR symbols will trigger a payout of 60x the bet while the single 7 symbol rewards players with 120x their bet. Finally, the Triple 7 symbol pays 250x the bet.</p>
<p>The game’s wild symbol is represented by a diamond which can expand vertically to cover all the reels. The diamond symbols can appear on the second, third, and fourth reels. The expended wild reel can replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of the scatter symbol and it will also pay after expansion.</p>
<p>The game also features a bonus or scatter symbol represented by a bag of coins which we are going to discuss later on in our review.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack has been carefully chosen to perfectly match the atmosphere created by the graphics design, color scheme, and game elements. Players will listen to soothing jazz sounds along with the relaxing clinking sounds made by the machines while watching the blinking lights as the reels spin, revealing more wins.</p>
<p>Wilds of Fortune Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and easy to decipher. By clicking the “i” tab, players can first access the available game options, rules, paytable, and autoplay options. There they will get to control the game settings including the background music and sound effects which can be turned on and off on the spot, along with the turbo play mode. Betsoft also lets players choose Autoplay mode with up to 100 spins at a time and easily manage their best size using the available “+” and “-” buttons at the bottom of the grid.</p>
<p>Wilds of Fortune: Free Respins &amp; Scatter Wins Features</p>
<p>In order to trigger the Free Respins feature, players need a minimum of one expanded wild reel. The free spins are guaranteed to keep going until players are rewarded with a win. When at least three Money Bag Scatter symbols land on any position on the reels, players automatically receive a win. The higher the number of scatters, the greater the win.</p>
<p>During the Respins Feature, players who land a Diamond Wild on the three reels at the middle of the grid will see all pay symbols be substituted to form a winning combination. When the wild symbol falls and all the reels are no longer spinning, the wild is seen expanding across the whole surface of the reels for additional wins. At the same time, the respins feature will be enabled. The feature will keep running until players hit a win.</p>
<p>The Expanded Wild reels will last for the entire duration of the free respins feature. All extra diamond wilds seen landing will keep the expansion going.</p>
<p>The coin bag scatters are the highest-paying feature in the game. While they are not seen during the free respins feature, they do attract extra payouts when at least three symbols land anywhere while engaged in the base game. Players get a payout of 50x their bet for three scatters, 100x for matching four scatters, and 500x the wager for five scatters at the maximum bet allowed capped at $10.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Suitable for low-bankroll players looking for a classic fruity-themed one-armed-bandit game to carry them back in time, Wilds of Fortune is another excellent release from Betsoft. With plenty of modern features for engaging action on the reels and higher payouts, excellent graphic design, and a comfortable variance level, the game has plenty to offer.</p>
