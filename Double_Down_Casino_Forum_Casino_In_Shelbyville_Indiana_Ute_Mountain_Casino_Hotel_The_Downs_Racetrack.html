    <h1>Double Down Casino Forum Casino In Shelbyville Indiana Ute Mountain Casino Hotel The Downs Racetrack</h1>

<p>Hey Alan, Matej,</p>
<p>Had a look at what's what and I have to say I've seen prettier situations.</p>
<p>Matej: I've gone ahead and sent you screen shots of the blow-by blow for you to review.</p>
<p>Alan, there's a lot going on here. It started awesome actually, you made a cash deposit on a no maximum cashout deposit coupon and were doing quite well. If you had left it alone and just continued to play and win then this would be a much happier story but unfortunately you did what many new players who haven't read the terms and conditions are prone to do: You deposited on top of your ($14,000!!!) playable balance some very different funds. This time you used another coupon for deposit, this particular coupon had a 10x max cashout. When you did that you made it so that all of the funds in your account were now only valued at 10x your deposit amount or $400. This is called "mixing funds" and I'm sure that Matej would tell you you're not the first player to make this mistake. Any time you have a balance and you deposit any funds at all on top of it you're asking for a bad day. If it's cash only, no big deal as cash is king and carries no rules to speak of. If the funds are differing types with different rules attached then it's a different story.</p>
<p>The approvals department saw the situation and were kind enough to approve one single withdrawal request of $1980 (after bonus removal). It was not necessary and quite nice of them honestly as only $400 was the required approval amount from all of your requested withdrawals.</p>
<p>I reviewed your communications with the casino and I see back and forth regarding your particular bank and a different bank being requested. I'll just clarify that this is never the choice of the casino, it's has to do with who and what types of accounts our 3rd party payment providers can deliver to. Your bank wasn't among them. No additional payout option was provided by you and the approved funds after some time were deposited back into the casino.</p>
<p>Had you re-requested the withdrawal I could perhaps help you here and get it all ironed out for a withdrawal but you played the redeposited funds so even the amount that was approved is now gone.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate but that's where the story ends.</p>
<p>I genuinely wish I had better news for you but unfortunately in this case there isn't a thing to be done. Having an understanding of the terms and conditions of the casino and the specific rules regarding any bonus you accept is quite important, the other way to learn is the hard way as we see here and if you don't learn them on your own then it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Nick and Planet 7</p>
