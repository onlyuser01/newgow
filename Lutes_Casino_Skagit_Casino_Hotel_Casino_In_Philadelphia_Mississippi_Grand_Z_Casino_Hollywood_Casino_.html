    <h1>Lutes Casino Skagit Casino Hotel Casino In Philadelphia Mississippi Grand Z Casino Hollywood Casino</h1>

<p>Casino refused to pay out winnings, even after verification was submitted, and online chat rep said documents were verified. First time I played, I deposited $40 from my credit card. And got a 50% match bonus which totaled $80. $40 being my deposit. I lost .couple days later, I won using a free bonus for a credit of 100 my winnings were close to $5000 that was AFTER completing well over the play through and wager amount. I requested my withdrawal, then deposited 20 through my bitcoin account didn't use any bonus . Lost. Reversed withdrew a fee hundred a couple times not using any bonus at all. My withdrawal amount was still at about $5000 without using any bonuses. I never used any free bonuses besides the one I won money on, and before that I deposited money. I went through the verification process. Sent my face with my license. And cards they requested. After they said I was verified. They said wait 48 hours the withdrawal will process to my bitcoin account where I requested the funds to be deposited. The next day they locked my account. And when I called to ask why, they said there was a dispute from my bank when they tried to deposit the money, so they said they refunded one of my deposits which I have not received. And locked my account, cancelling my winnings. My bank has no recollection of a dispute. Or an attempt to deposit funds. I have screen shots of conversations. Deposit receipts. And saved emails from them they are denying me my winnings do to a bank dispute on my end that does not exist please help.</p>
