<p>After losing to the New Orleans Saints last weekend, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are now in danger of missing out on the 2024 playoff action. They still have roughly 75% chance of getting to the postseason, but for that, they need to beat the Panthers in Carolina next Sunday.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers Need to Bounce Back</p>
<p>Tampa’s superb run of four wins in a row ended last weekend when they lost to the New Orleans Saints 23-13 at home. They’re now 8-8 on the season, but there’s still hope they can make the postseason. Actually, they’ll probably do it if they beat the Panthers on Sunday.</p>
<p>They’ve already done it once this season. It was early December when we saw the Bucs win the NFC South clash 21-18. It was a very close game, which Tampa won thanks to a great performance from their defensive team in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Their offense, on the other hand, wasn’t too impressive. This goes especially for the fact that they played against one of the league’s worst defenses. Will they do better this time? They need to. Otherwise, they might end up not making the playoffs.</p>
<p>Will Carolina Ruin Tampa’s Playoff Plans?</p>
<p>The good news for the Buccaneers is that in the final week of the regular season, they’re taking on the worst team in the league. The Panthers are 2-14, with their wins being very narrow – they beat the Houston Texans 15-13 and the Atlanta Falcons 9-7.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that both of those wins happened on their turf. Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is where the Panthers are going to host the Week 18 game with the Bucs as well. That’s where they destroyed them 21-3 last season. However, things have changed a lot since, and the Panthers definitely do not look capable of repeating the same.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Carolina Panthers Prediction</p>
<p>The Buccaneers are way, way better than the Panthers, so anything but a convincing win on Sunday would be an embarrassment for Todd Bowles’s men. Not only that, but a loss in Week 18 could mean ending up without a playoff ticket.</p>
<p>This is why we’re 100% certain they’re going to take this game very seriously. At least seriously enough to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Pick: Tampa Bay Buccaneers -5.5</p>
