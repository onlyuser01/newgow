<p>Stakelogic has formed a new content alliance that will allow it to quickly deploy its live casino products across an ample network of partners</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live has now become an official supplier for Aspire Global, a platform that caters to hundreds of operators across the world, with a particular focus on Europe.</p>
<p>Through an integration facilitated by Pariplay, Stakelogic Live’s products will now be available to Aspire Global partners in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark, but also in jurisdictions covered by a license from the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live brings a variety of products that are well-received, including its Game Shows, American Blackjack and Roulette tables. The company’s latest networking partnership comes on the tail of a similar one with another supplier of platform solutions, SkillOnNet.</p>
<p>To ensure that the games run smoothly, Stakelogic Live has its own dedicated studios in Malta and uses high-definition cameras and powerful software and hardware to relay the action from the studio to players’ homes or anywhere they may be. The studio also offers the Super Stake feature to elevate the experience a notch further.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live Determined to Service Some of Biggest Operators</p>
<p>Commenting on this new partnership formed with Aspire Global, Stakelogic Live head of live casino Richard Walker welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with Aspire Global, arguing that the company powered some of the biggest iGaming brands in the world and that Stakelogic would now have the chance to expand across numerous jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>“This integration means that must-have live games are now available to their players, significantly increasing the reach of our titles,” Walker added. He also said that the live casino vertical is one that has been rapidly expanding and a space in which Stakelogic has a mission to provide the best possible product. Stakelogic Live previously confirmed that is going to go ahead with a branded studio for Circus Casino.</p>
