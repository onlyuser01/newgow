<p>The award-winning iGaming provider offering a wide range of engaging video slots, table, instant and branded games, Evoplay, announced a new partnership with the leading sports betting and iGaming operator, Interwetten. Inked earlier this week, the collaboration sees the iGaming content provider supply its portfolio of games, powering the offering of the operator. Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, Evoplay's games will become available to Interwetten players.</p>
<p>As a result, customers of the operator will be able to access engaging titles from Evoplay's diverse range of games. Such include hits like Elven Princesses and The Greatest Catch Bonus Buy. Additionally, Interwetten's clients will be able to experience other hit games like Penalty Shoot-out among other titles. While the latest partnership boosts the operator's offering, it also helps Evoplay reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the collaboration represents an important agreement for Interwetten. Currently, the operator's services are renowned across the globe, but it has a particularly strong presence in German-speaking countries and in Europe. Overall, Interwetten has more than 30 years of experience within the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Szczepan Scibor, Interwetten's Casino Executive, was excited about the latest content partnership. In a statement, they explained: "Evoplay’s track record of success made them a natural partner to expand our gaming offering." Last but not least, Scibor pointed out: "Interwetten prides itself on offering unmatched entertainment to players with the latest innovative experiences on the market, a criterion which is fulfilled by Evoplay’s diverse range of forward-thinking games, and we can’t wait to see how our players react."</p>

"As we strive to elevate gaming experiences through our dynamic catalog, we anticipate this will be a fruitful partnership for both," he explained in conclusion.</p>
<p>The deal with Interwetten comes on the heels of another strategic partnership inked by Evoplay recently. Back at the end of August, the company confirmed it boosted the reach of its games via a collaboration with REEVO, the constantly growing content and aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Before that, Evoplay confirmed it entered Portugal via an agreement with Solverde. At the time, the company confirmed that 30 of its innovative and engaging games will power the operator.</p>
