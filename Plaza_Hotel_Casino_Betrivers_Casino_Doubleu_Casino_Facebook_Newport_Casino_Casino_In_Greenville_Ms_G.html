    <h1>Plaza Hotel Casino Betrivers Casino Doubleu Casino Facebook Newport Casino Casino In Greenville Ms G</h1>

<p>The company known for its signature Slingo games has now introduced free rounds to bring players even more joy and satisfaction with their gameplay</p>
<p>The new feature is introduced with the company’s latest title, Saucy Slingo, which is developed in partnership with another company, MrQ. This free rounds mechanic is meant as a promotional tool to bolster games’ reach and pull with individual players and is expected to have a positive impact on interest in Slingo games in general.</p>
<p>Exclusive New Free Rounds Tool to Cater to Fans</p>
<p>MrQ players will be incentivized to try Saucy Slingo and not ever need to deposit any funds to do so. Saucy Slingo is the first game to be launching with this new promotional tool and will serve as a litmus test as to how efficient the measure can be when seeking to secure a stronger start for existing and new titles with new operators.</p>
<p>Saucy Slingo is also developed as an exclusive release for MrQ. Gaming Realms has long sought to innovate beyond its traditional stomping ground and the introduction of a dedicated free rounds promotional mechanic and tool is just what it needs.</p>
<p>The game comes with an increasing prize ladder, wilds and super wilds, and a max win of 5,000x. Gaming Realms commercial account manager Ian Robson hailed the introduction of the new exclusive game with MrQ and said that it would definitely be adding to the excitement players will enjoy at the casino. Robson added:</p>
<p>We are genuinely thrilled to be working with MrQ in this capacity and are excited to further strengthen our partnership with a key online casino brand. Gaming Realms commercial account manager Ian Robson</p>
<p>Bringing Innovation Where It’s Needed</p>
<p>MrQ head of product Satpal Chaggar was similarly excited to welcome the partnership with Gaming Realms and the company’s acclaimed Slingo product lineup.</p>
<p>“This opportunity is further enhanced by the launch of Saucy Slingo; our new fully exclusive Slingo game only available on MrQ.com,” Chaggar explained. He argued that this collaboration opens a new chapter for both companies.</p>
<p>Even then, this is not the first time that Gaming Realms has gone out of its way to work on exclusive partnerships with a well-represented entity from the gambling industry. The studio landed its IP license to Entain to build an exclusive Slingo Game.</p>
<p>Gaming Realms has been growing its reach in the meantime with the company setting up shop in Spain as well as SkillOnNet, as the supplier is now helping the operator of iGaming brands to diversify its library with fresh and innovative titles.</p>
