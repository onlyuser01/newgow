    <h1>Milkyway Casino Isleta Resort Casino Joliet Casino Bally Casino Pa Casino Public Relations VBET Vows</h1>

<p>As a partner of the upcoming charity event, the betting and gaming company seeks to boost the donations that seek to help with the rebuilding of the damaged Mykhailo-Kotsiubynsky Lyceum</p>
<p>The award-winning betting and gaming operator, VBET, announced a new sponsorship that seeks to support the upcoming charity match called Game4Ukraine. The charity soccer game is scheduled for August 5, 2023, and seeks to boost donations for the fundraising platform UNITED24 which seeks to help restore the Mykhailo-Kotsiubynsky Lyceum located in the Chernihiv region, Ukraine.</p>
<p>The lyceum suffered damage from the Russian occupying forces back in March last year. Ultimately, Game4Ukraine seeks to help raise funds for the restoration of the Mykhailo-Kotsiubynsky Lyceum and bring back hundreds of children to school.</p>
<p>The charity soccer match will meet two teams, led by Andriy Shevchenko and Oleksandr Zinchenko, who are ambassadors of UNITED24. Besides the match, the event will feature live music and other entertainment activations that seek to help raise donations.</p>
<p>Shevchenko shared his excitement about the upcoming event and said: “Football and music have always had an incredible ability to bring people together and we really hope this will be a day to remember for everyone, united in looking towards a better future.”</p>
<p>Zinchenko was similarly excited about the upcoming charity event and pointed out that it will be great to see globally-recognized soccer players and musicians participate in the noble initiative that seeks to help rebuild the damaged educational institution. “I hope we can fill the stadium on August 5th and really make this a day to be proud of,” he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>Activations Organized by VBET to Boost Donations</p>
<p>Game4Ukraine will take place at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London, the UK. By becoming a partner of the charity match, VBET will benefit from brand exposure via the stadium. The gaming and betting company’s logo will also be seen on the soccer player’s shorts.</p>
<p>Additionally, VBET vowed to create different initiatives that seek to promote the charity match. As the company has established a presence in different jurisdictions around Europe, it will leverage this to its advantage and help raise funds for the restoration of the lyceum.</p>
<p>“We understand the value of responsibility towards the country, society, and players, that’s why VBET could not stay indifferent to this event.“ Artem Ivanytsky, CMO at VBET Ukraine</p>
<p>Artem Ivanytsky, VBET Ukraine’s CMO, explained that the company understands the importance of the charity event which is why it is happy for this collaboration. “We proudly support Andriy Shevchenko and Oleksandr Zinchenko in their endeavors,” he added. Finally, Ivanytsky said that VBET won’t be just a partner of the upcoming event but it will also engage in activations that seek to boost the donations.</p>
