    <h1>Century Casinos River Bend Casino And Hotel Buffalo Bill S Resort And Casino Primm Nevada Ricky Gap</h1>

<p>Dear Xontin35,</p>
<p>I have checked the Self-exclusion policy of Slothub Casino and this is what I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conditions and Processes</li>
</ol>
<p>To self-exclude means to stop betting or gambling for a set time. Self-exclusion can be temporary or permanent.</p>
<p>By requesting one of our self-exclusion time periods on offer you agree to the following terms and conditions, which will be effective from the minute you receive a confirmation email of your chosen self-exclusion, this email will be sent to the email address used to register your account only and will display the date of self-exclusion completion.Requests made via our Chat function will not be actioned. However, a customer support agent will direct you to our customer support email service.</p>
<p>On receipt of an email request for account closure, the requested account and any linked accounts will be placed on our first stage, 24-hr cooling off period which will disable your account or accounts, allowing no gambling activity. Once this time has passed; while your account or accounts remain closed, a customer support agent will inform you of the 1-week, 1-month, 6-months and permanent self-exclusions available. There will be no variation of these time periods. To proceed with this process, we will require an email response. If we do not receive a response within a further 24 - hrs, your account will be reopened and confirmed by email.If after reviewing our self-exclusion options you decide you would like to proceed with a permanent self-exclusion, you will be required to set an exclusion period when prompted. On occasion, we might decide to place an account on a short self-exclusion period if we believe it to be needed and or beneficial to the customer. This will be communicated by email; the above terms and conditions will apply.</p>
<p>You are not permitted to leave any balance in your account during a self-exclusion time period. You will not be able to access your account to withdraw any funds during your requested self-exclusion. If you have an account affected by a self-exclusion that has any active bets, the Cash Out function will be applied at the point of self-exclusion confirmation. Bets will not be void; SlotHub will not be returned or remain active throughout a self-exclusion time period. Bets will not be reinstated after a self-exclusion completion. While Self Excluded, you are not eligible for any form of benefits, bonuses or reloads.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you received any confirmation email from the casino yet?</p>
<p>Did you send your self-exclusion request from the same email address that you used for registration at the casino?</p>
