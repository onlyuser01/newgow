    <h1>Are There Casinos In Florida Harveys Resort Casino Free Casino Apps Casinos In New Orleans Louisiana</h1>

<p>I'll try to respond point by point: 1. Its not different from classic table roulette, but this system dictates that player must wait a certain amount of time (spins) before jumping in to wager. At a real table they will not let you just stand there and not bet while takeing up space while others want to play. It is different than a totally electronic roulette machine that uses a RNG. No one can beat a RNG. This system must be played in a bubble machine where the outcome is physical not computer generated. 2. I may have switched 2.6 or .6 inadvertantly, don't worry about that. You are talking tenths or hundreths of a percent. 3. The advantage of American roulette is that there are 2 green numbers, when you are betting on them. This system bets on green numbers when they are cold, thus you have 2 chances of landing instead of one. (5.2% instead of 2.6%) 4. Yes, a number missing 538 times is increcibly rare or 111 times out of 1,000. These are the extremes. I could also say that I've seen the green numbers hit 7 or 8 times consecutively, but this would be extreme also. Throw out the extremes and focus on the more consistant percentages. We all know the wheel can be a monster sometimes, thats the nature of the beast, thats why it is gambling. 5. After a wait of the certain number of spins in which the numbers turn "cold," (my base number) the chances of them hitting are exactly the same as a hot number or any other number (2.6%.) In this case, since we are betting the green numbers, the chances improve to 5.2%, 2 divided by 38 instead of 1 divided by 38. We have doubled our chance of hitting a cold, green number There is a 17 spin "window" in which it is profitable if you hit, after 17 spins it is not profitable. A.I. says there is a 68.1% chance either a 0 or 00 will hit within that window. I couldn't do the math myself, thats why I asked A.I. The more you stretch out the base number, the higher the percentage increase that you will hit a cold green number according to A.I. What you are missing and what I have with held is the "base number", which I was hoping to recieve a little gratitude fo.. I will give the system away free but hoping for a little love if someone hits it big or wins consistantly.</p>
