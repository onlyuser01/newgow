<p>The First Installment in an “Electrifying Series”</p>
<p>Wazdan’s chief commercial officer Andrzej Hyla spoke about the “first installment” of what the company believes will turn into an “electrifying series”, describing the game as one with great potential to become a staple of their offering.</p>
<p>Hyka also discussed the “attention to detail on display” that will stimulate players’ senses and the easily-comprehensive game mechanics mixed with the theme inspired by mythology. Together, all these elements are prone to trigger “satisfactory results” for all Wazdan partners.</p>
<p>Among the most attractive elements and mechanics, we can mention the standard Hold the Jackpot round that comes with a variety of bonus symbols promoting bigger wins and turning all bonus rounds into even more exciting experiences.</p>
<p>The Sticky to Infinity and Cash Infinity features are also part of the new game, giving operators the chance to take advantage of higher rates of player engagement improving the player experience, and boosting retention rates.</p>
<p>Players Can Pick their Preferred Volatility Level</p>
<p>When engaged in the Hold the Jackpot bonus round with the help of the Buy Feature, players are allowed to freely choose their preferred level of volatility while jumping straight into the action. The one-of-a-kind Wazdan Features allow players to easily make any additional adjustments needed to turn the game into a unique product.</p>
<p>During the Hold the Jackpot bonus round, players will enjoy the action on 15 different reels while waiting for the Mystery and the Svarog Mystery symbols. These symbols are able to change into a number of Collector and Jackpot symbols.</p>
<p>The Svarog Jackpot is worth 1,000x the original bet and it can be triggered with the help of the Svarog Mystery symbol. Players who cover all 15 reels using bonus symbols can get their hands on the Grand Jackpot which is valued at 5,000x once the bonus round is complete.</p>
<p>Last December, Wazdan announced its sixth partnership deal with Paf, agreeing to power the company’s Spain-based brand with its top content. During the same month, the supplier also marked its seventh market entry for 2022 with the Czech Republic.</p>
