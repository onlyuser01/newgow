<p>PokerStars is an anchor in the online poker space. The company has operated for years and has been around since 2001, having established itself as the de-facto go-to platform for poker aficionados who want to play online and have a shot at turning poker into a career.</p>
<p>PokerStars has a reputation for its ‘by-the-book’ attitude towards gaming, which means that the operator is only available if and only has the necessary licenses to offer its products in a specific jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the platform is now available across dozens of countries and individual states and provinces in North America. This makes it a go-to choice for poker aficionados the world over. We dive into all that you need to know about PokerStars Review.</p>
<p>PokerStars Overview and Facts</p>
<p>PokerStars is the world’s largest poker network. Present in Europe, the United Kingdom, North America, and beyond, the card room has the world’s biggest player base. Many of these player bases are now being consolidated under shared-liquidity compacts such as the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The company took a drubbing in 2011 in the United States, but it has been stronger than ever since. PokerStars is regulated and operates in several US states, for example, it’s present in some of the biggest European markets such as Spain, Italy, and France, and maintains a hefty presence elsewhere.</p>
<p>It also runs multi-table tournaments, multi-million tournaments, and countless cash games. The platform became incredibly popular in the early 2000s thanks to Chris Moneymaker, Joe Hachem, and Greg Raymer who competed in WSOP satellite events on the platforms and made it to the grand event in Nevada.</p>
<p>PokerStars has a fleet of ambassadors that places the brand as a recognizable name with millions of people worldwide. Vanessa Selbst, Daniel Negreanu, and Jason Mercier are just some of the names to have joined the PokerStars team over the years and promote the brand but also a love for the game.</p>
<p>Games and Software on PokerStars</p>
<p>PokerStars brings you a solid variety of cash games to choose from which will be your bread and butter when it comes to gaming. The cash game selection is indeed unmatched when it comes to the opportunity to play flexible limits and play without interruption around the clock.</p>
<p>While some markets are still a bit underserved due to a lack of enough active players, the combination of liquidity in the United States is definitely helping. The PokerStars platform in the United Kingdom is definitely thriving, though.</p>
<p>The lowest stakes you can play are 0.01/0.02 and the biggest ones go to 200/400 units. You get to play the likes of Limit Hold’em, Seven Card Stud, Mixed Games, and quite a few interesting formats created by PokerStars to bring you even more worthwhile experiences, such as Zoom Poker or 6+ Hold’em. You will find more cash limits, such as 10/20 units and 50/100 for the various games.</p>
<p>PokerStars Multi-Table Tournaments</p>
<p>PokerStars’ multi-table tournaments are definitely some of the best. It’s often challenged by GGPoker, its main competitor, but all in all, PokerStars reigns supreme. Competition is always good for players, though, as it means that PokerStars is constantly on the lookout to provide you with the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Presently, the brand runs a number of global series which are adjusted for each individual market, including the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), Spring Championship of Online Poker (SCOOP), and the Micro Millions to name just a few of the prominent brands.</p>
<p>The company similarly runs weekly and weekend tournaments, which are there for the amusement of players who get to vie for varying prize pools and opportunities. Buy-ins and prize pools will vary. You have numerous prizes you can scoop up and they range from $1,050 to $50,000 for most of the weekly action.</p>
<p>Weekend events are naturally much bigger when it comes to guaranteed money pools, and these pools almost always exceed their targets which are doubly tantalizing for the player bases.</p>
