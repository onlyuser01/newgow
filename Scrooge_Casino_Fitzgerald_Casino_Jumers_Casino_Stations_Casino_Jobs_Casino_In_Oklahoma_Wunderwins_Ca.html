    <h1>Scrooge Casino Fitzgerald Casino Jumers Casino Stations Casino Jobs Casino In Oklahoma Wunderwins Ca</h1>

<p>Well it seems i was able to withdrawal the balance, strangely with couple smaller amounts. But anyhow the way the support treats its customers is strange. Now i have to see will they accept my withdrawals or are they going to cancel them.</p>
<p>My issue was the same as the guy i linked to the title. I was not able to withdrawal the winnings i got, always got an "oops, something went wrong, contact support"- message. Support had always the same questions and solutions several times without an result. I was not able to get any proper answers to my own questions, they always changed the subject, regarding what i asked. Live chat support felt very much like an AI or really scripted.</p>
<p>I did not do an bonusdepo it was fully raw.</p>
