<p>Expanding into the United States iGaming market, Paysafe has added Scot McClintic as SVP iGaming Product &amp; Strategy. McClintic will help spearhead the company strategy in the quickly expanding iGaming and sports betting segments in the country.</p>
<p>Scot McClintic Heads Paysafe iGaming Expansion Strategy</p>
<p>Paysafe Group is making a definitive shift towards the iGaming space, or if not a shift altogether, then at least branching off to cover the burgeoning iGaming sector in the United States. In the latest round of appointments, the company has brought Scot McClintic onboard as SVP, iGaming Product &amp; Strategy.</p>
<p>The segment is an exciting new opportunity for the company to expand into and satisfy a growing demand that is only going to accelerate over the next decade. McClintic will work under Paysafe EVP, US iGaming Ben Dalfen, and be in charge of Paysafe’s expansion efforts in iGaming, iLottery and sports betting.</p>
<p>Paysafe has chosen to create a user-friendly configurable payments platform that merchants can access through a single API plug-in, the company explained in a recent press release. The solution is fully integrated and unified in a single iGaming product suite to make for better ease of use. Stepping into the position, McClintic had this to add:</p>
<p>“I’ve been closely watching Paysafe’s rapid growth, particularly in the U.S., over the past few years and I’m thrilled to be joining such a dynamic, fast-paced company at such an exciting time in the industry.” -Paysafe SVP, iGaming Product &amp; Strategy Scot McClintic</p>
<p>McClintic’s Expertise to Shape Paysafe’s Strategy</p>
<p>McClintic makes a valuable addition in his new position, benefiting and empowering Paysafe through a decade of experience in strategic business development, as well as market analysis and product ownership. He is now focusing on licensed operators across the US iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>McClintic is coming from a position as Chief Product Officer and General Manager for Penn National Gaming-owned Barstool Sportsbook &amp; Casino, with a focus on the iGaming and online products of the company.</p>
<p>He has contributed a fair bit to other companies and honed his experience in strategic business development in other companies, including Comcast-NBCUniversal, where he helped forge the company’s sports betting operator strategy.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy appointments include Acumen Fiscal Agent, NRG Energy and Bloomberg. Dalfen was equally excited about the opportunity to work with McClintic, having this to add:</p>
<p>“Scot is a savvy, well-connected and highly customer-centric leader and we’re delighted he is joining the team to spearhead the next stage of our iGaming expansion strategy.” -Paysafe EVP, US iGaming Ben Dalfen</p>
<p>Dalfen is convinced that McClintic is a great addition in the company’s further growth in the iGaming and sports betting market. McClintic will bolster the company’s team and prove a valuable asset, Dalfen concluded confidently.</p>
