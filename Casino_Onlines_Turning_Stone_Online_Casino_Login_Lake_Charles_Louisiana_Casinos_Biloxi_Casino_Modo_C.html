<p>ESPN’s Daily Wager Says Adios to Las Vegas</p>
<p>Posted on: August 30, 2023, 07:54h.</p>

<p>The sports network made the announcement earlier today. “Daily Wager,” which airs on ESPN2, has broadcast from a 6,000-square-foot studio inside The LINQ Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for the past three years.</p>
<p>ESPN created some great content and incredible memories during our time at the Las Vegas studio,” said Scott Clark, vice president of fantasy &amp; sports betting content, in a statement. “With our new ESPN BET deal set to launch this fall, we felt it was best to return to our headquarters. We cannot thank everyone we worked with at Caesars Entertainment over the past few years, and we wish them the best into the future.”</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR) is the operator of the LINQ. ESPN is a unit of Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).</p>
<p>Speaking of Caesars</p>
<p>It appears that the LINQ’s status as the home of “Daily Wager” is the first clear casualty of the 10-year, $1.5 billion agreement ESPN struck earlier this month with Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: PENN).</p>
<p>That deal allows the regional casino operator to use the ESPN Bet brand on its mobile and retail sportsbooks. The pact was revealed nearly three years to the day that ESPN unveiled what was then viewed as landmark accords with Caesars (NASDAQ: CZR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG).</p>
<p>Following news of the ESPN/Penn relationship, it was widely speculated that the sports network would sever ties with the other two gaming companies. The announcement of “Daily Wager” moving to Connecticut could be the first sign of that happening.</p>
<p>It’s likely not an issue for Caesars, which was rumored to be looking to get out of the ESPN deal to save cash. Now, the operator has 6,000 square feet at the LINQ that can be used in a potentially more profitable fashion.</p>
<p>Changes Continue for Daily Wager</p>
<p>News of the move to Connecticut is the latest in a recent series of changes for “Daily Wager.” Doug Kezirian — a former Las Vegas sportscaster and original host of the ESPN show — was recently let go by the network, even though ESPN boasted of strong ratings for the program.</p>
<p>Another change is the addition of a Saturday edition of the sports wagering show, aimed at preparing viewers for college and NFL betting action. That edition will air at 11 a.m. Eastern time on ESPN2.</p>
<p>“Daily Wager” also airs on Sundays at 9 a.m. Eastern, Mondays at 4 p.m., and Thursdays and Fridays at 6 p.m. The show is not broadcast on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
