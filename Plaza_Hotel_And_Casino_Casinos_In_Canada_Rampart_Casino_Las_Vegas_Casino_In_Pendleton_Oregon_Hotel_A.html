    <h1>Plaza Hotel And Casino Casinos In Canada Rampart Casino Las Vegas Casino In Pendleton Oregon Hotel A</h1>

<p>Dear Buglann1225,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience with Casino Extreme. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>When exactly have you requested your winnings to be redeemed? When was the last time you communicated with customer support and what was it about? Could you please send me the link to the free chips you activated?</p>
<p>Regarding free chips, please bear in mind that there are often certain rules that must be completed in order to cash them out. I checked the casino's Terms and Conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>7.2 New User Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>a. The following rules apply to a new user free money Welcome Bonus placed at the opening of a new User Account:</p>
<p>b. If you received a non-deposit based bonus (free chips), you are required to wager 30 x the value of the free chip.</p>
<p>c. Only one free chip is credited per person, family, household address, email address, credit card number, and computer and shared computers (for example: university, fraternity, school, public library or workplace).</p>
<p>d. If you have taken advantage of any Welcome Bonus in the past, you are not eligible for any successive Welcome Bonuses.</p>
<p>e. Verification deposit is needed prior to any withdrawal been processed from the New Signup Bonus. If verification deposit is not made within 7 days from the date the New Signup Bonus has been received, all winnings and bonus amount will be removed with no prior notice.</p>
<p>Moreover, no-deposit bonuses often have a maximum amount you may win and subsequently withdraw. Generally, the casino's Terms state that:</p>
<p>7.7 Standard Free Chip Bonus Rules</p>
<p>b. You may withdraw a minimum of $/â‚¬ 50 and a maximum of 5x the value of the free chip bonus unless otherwise stated in the promotion.</p>
<p>c. Upon meeting your wagering requirements, any balance in excess of your maximum cashout limit will be removed from your account automatically.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
