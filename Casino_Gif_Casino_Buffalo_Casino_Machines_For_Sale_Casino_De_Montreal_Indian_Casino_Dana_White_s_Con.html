<p>Rodriguez versus Cortez: Whom to Back?</p>
<p>The title fight here is the bout between Junior Cortez (+165) and Christian Rodriguez (-200). Rodriguez is going five fights undefeated, his total so far. At the promising age of 23, he may be looking at a UFC career before long.</p>
<p>His opponent, Cortez, has lost once and he is understandably the underdog. Both fighters have the same number of fights, too. Rodriguez is touted as a talent in the making and a prospect who will eventually make it in the UFC.</p>
<p>He is also young allowing him to develop his skills further over the coming years. To do that on a professional level, though, he will have to overcome Cortez who is given good value on the moneyline here. There is always a temptation to bet against the favorite, but in this case, we believe the odds got the bout correctly.</p>
<p>Who Else is on the List?</p>
<p>Taking a look at the remainder of the roster, it’s easy to see why there are many tempting opportunities this Tuesday. We expect Martin Buday to bring in a quick fight by most likely KO/TKOing his opponent early and quick. His (-400) are there for a reason as he has a total track record of 8-1-0.</p>
<p>The fight between Jake Hadley and Mitch Raposo is far more interesting as they are both great fighters with 7-0-0 and 5-0-0 respectively. Hadley seems to be the favorite here, but we say pick Raposo as he offers a much better value and he is equally matched to Hadley from where we stand.</p>
<p>For the next pair, Chris Duncan is almost a sure-winner with his powerful punches probably securing him a KO victory on Tuesday. As to Paprocki vs. Silva, we feel Silva is a deserved favorite. You can explore other markets as well in a bid to eke out the best value here.</p>
