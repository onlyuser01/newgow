<p>The leading business-to-business solutions provider for online gambling operators offering live game shows, live casino games and more content, Evolution Group, announced its entry into the regulated gambling market in Panama. The company revealed Thursday it has gone live in the market via Codere Online, a leading casino operator.</p>
<p>Codere Online Introduces Evolution Content in Panama</p>
<p>The launch means that Codere Online customers via www.codere.pa can now access Evolution’s online slots and live casino games. This collaboration will deliver highly-popular live casino games, as well as live game shows offered by the leading developer for Codere Online clients in Panama. Such content will include some of the best titles from Evolution’s brands Red Tiger and NetEnt.</p>
<p>This new partnership further extends Evolution’s global footprint. What’s more, the new deal marks the leading provider’s first operator agreement for the newly regulated gambling market in Panama. Initially, the Gaming Control Board in the country certified one group of games. However, Evolution revealed it anticipates the certification and consequent launch of more games in the upcoming months. According to Evolution, its live games for the market in Panama are streamed from its state-of-the-art studio which enables online players to play together simultaneously.</p>
<p>What’s more, the new game further complements Evolution’s successful collaboration with Codere Online which spans to other markets in Latin America, as well as Europe. Besides Panama, the duo collaborates within other LatAm regions such as Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.</p>

She pointed out that Codere is the first operator to offer Evolution’s leading content in the country. Finally, Umaña said: “The Latin American market is very important for Evolution Group and this is another major expansion of our presence in this region.”</p>
<p>“We are proud of our long and successful partnership with Codere Online in multiple jurisdictions and delighted to have Codere Online as the first operator of our games in Panama.“ Mónica Umaña, Evolution’s head of operations LatAm</p>
<p>Salo Leder, Codere Online’s Regional Manager for Latin America, added that the company is excited to deliver leading online casino games and engaging experiences for players in Panama.
