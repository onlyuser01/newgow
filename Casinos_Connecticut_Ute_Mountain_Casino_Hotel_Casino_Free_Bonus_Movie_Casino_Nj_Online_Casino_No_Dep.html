<p>AC Milan will debut teams in EA’s FIFA 21 and Supercell’s Brawl Stars with Qlash helping the soccer team shape its esports footprint.</p>
<p>Qlash and AC Milan Join Efforts to Create Esports Club</p>
<p>Italy’s AC Milan is the latest athletic organization to follow in the footsteps of others and opt for esports exposure. Earlier today, the club revealed its entry into esports, tying up a partnership with Qlash, a platform focused on the competitive gaming experience.</p>
<p>The pair will launch a dedicated gaming outfit by the name of AC Milan Qlash that will compete in FIFA 21, a sports simulator and (one of) the most successful attempts to recreate soccer virtually.</p>
<p>AC Milan Qlash will field participants in the FIFA Global Series and FIFA Club World Cup, with Diego ‘Qlash Crazy’ Campagnani and Fabio ‘Qlash Denuzzo’ Denuzzo already ready to step in and represent the team.</p>
<p>The team will drive forays into other competitive titles, including Supercell’s widely popular mobile hit, Brawl Stars. A squad will participate in the upcoming World Finals on November 21 and November 22.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, AC Milan chief revenue officer Casper Stylsvig said that the agreement was an important step forward for the brand. He further added:</p>
<p>“We are sure it will be an exciting and incredible experience, both for us and for our fans around the world, and we’re delighted to be embarking on this new adventure in the world of esports in partnership with a leading company like Qlash.”</p>
<p>Investing in the Future without Breaking with Tradition</p>
<p>Qlash co-founder and chief executive Luca Pagano commended AC Milan’s drive to expand into new markets, and argued that not many traditional companies had the courage to branch off in what is a completely unfamiliar territory for them.</p>
<p>Pagano said that he was happy that AC Milan chose to partner with Qlash on a brand and commercial level, and allow the company to boost exposure for AC Milan among younger demographics.</p>
<p>Investing in esports is a way for sponsors to prepare for the future without breaking or neglecting traditions or the present, Pagano added. AC Milan is hardly the first team to have invested in esports.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) tied up a pivotal partnership with Chinese powerhouse LGD in 2018, fielding one of the most successful Dota 2 teams, a game developed by Valve Corporation, that enjoys a massive prize pool worth over $40 million for what is its upcoming crowning event in 2021.</p>
<p>Other soccer teams to have launched esports squads include but aren’t limited to FC Schalke, Bayern Munich, Ajax Amsterdam, AS Roma, and others.</p>
<p>The trend to see traditional athletic organizations show interest in esports is not limited to soccer either, with NFL and NBA franchises operating competitive gaming outfits of their own.</p>
