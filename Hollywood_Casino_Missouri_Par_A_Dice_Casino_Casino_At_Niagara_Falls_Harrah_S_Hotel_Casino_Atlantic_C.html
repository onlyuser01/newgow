<p>Sports Information Services has announced a new partnership with the leading sports betting platform bet365. Under the terms of the partnership, SIS will provide bet365 with the company’s select feeds of greyhound racing content, elevating the operator’s own coverage of the segment, and creating fresh opportunities for bettors and fans.</p>
<p>Bet365’s Greyhound Racing Gets a Boost</p>
<p>The partnership is set for a period of five years with SIS able to deliver extensive coverage of greyhound racing that will include 42 fixtures every week from races in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other popular international events. SIS is similarly interested to push its product portfolio and create fresh opportunities for its brand.</p>
<p>The agreement with bet365 will expand over the course of the next five years and it will help deliver on a key metric – better engagement and conversion of bettors. SIS commercial director Paul Witten said that his firm was very pleased with bet365 and what the company had to offer as a platform.</p>
<p>“This agreement is a further endorsement of the quality of our racing offer and SIS’ reputation as a trusted leading supplier of 24/7 live betting content for the last three decades.” SIS commercial director Paul Witten</p>
<p>Bet365 is also happy to be joining SIS for yet another partnership extension as the operator has a clear interest in upping the quality and quantity of its greyhound racing event which has been a popular asset for consumers.</p>
<p>New Greyhound Opportunities for Both Partners</p>
<p>As bet365 continues to pivot towards new markets and establish strong financial results at home and beyond, the addition of its SIS content will seek only to strengthen its product variety. Bet365 welcomed the addition of the SIS extended coverage to its portfolio publicly, adding:</p>
<p>“SIS has earned a deserved reputation within the betting industry for its top-quality racing content. This new long-term deal allows us to enhance our racing offering by providing premium greyhound racing to bettors across the world.” Bet365</p>
<p>Bet365 is similarly pleased with the addition of more greyhound products as the brand is determined to see better engagement from the segment and the consumers who visit the bet365 website to specifically place a wager on such events. Meanwhile, bet365 recently signed a partnership for content management services with Sportal365.</p>
