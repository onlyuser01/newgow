<p>Galaxy Gaming, Inc. has made a new advancement in its portfolio by introducing a brand new game management system. The Galaxy Operating System or GOS will provide a number of innovative features, such as progressive jackpots, LED sensors, and digital tracking to elevate the experience for partner operators significantly.</p>
<p>Commenting on this achievement in a press release, Galaxy Gaming CEO and President Todd Cravens said that GOS brings together an extensive knowledge of how table games progressives should work along with a modern approach to management systems.</p>
<p>This, Cravens said, created a realistic, dynamic, and scalableoperating system. "We believe that this is greater than just a progressive system. It’s a full operating system designed to evolve with the industry, our partners, and chiefly, with what players want. We can’t wait to thrill players with the GOS experience," Cravens explained.</p>
<p>One of the biggest highlights here is the digital tracking which will work with many of the company’s prominent games, including Roulette Up Progressive and Make’em All Progressive. There is also digital tracking enabled for another signature game, Two-Way Dice Progressive.</p>
<p>Galaxy will further strengthen its partner’s abilities to leverage GOS and use it to create all sorts of exciting opportunities for their customers. For example, the system will allow operators to link multiple tables, create unique jackpot opportunities, and further tailor the offer in a way that is suitable for their business and players.</p>
<p>Understandably, GOS features many subtler changes and innovations, such as sensors that instantly register bets when chips are placed. These sensors work with any configuration of the progressives, which is the main focus of this new product. The user interface and user experience have been updated as well to provide players with a slicker overall play area and also teach new players how to use the product.</p>
<p>The design is intuitive to empower businesses and players to get the most out of their time. GOS is not going to stop at just this release. Galaxy Gaming has confirmed that the solution has been designed as a brand-new hardware and software operating system that will be fitted with constant upgrades as time gets on. Galaxy will be introducing more improvements as well at the upcoming G2E 2023 expo that will take place on October 9, 2023.</p>
