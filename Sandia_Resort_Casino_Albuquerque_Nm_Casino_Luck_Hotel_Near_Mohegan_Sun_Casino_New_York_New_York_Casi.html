<p>FanDuel has committed substantial resources to the American Gaming Association’s “Have a Game Plan” campaign, which aims to promote responsible betting and raise awareness of problem gambling.</p>
<p>FanDuel Commits to Responsible Gambling Campaign</p>
<p>Today, US-based online gambling market leader FanDuel became the first mobile sportsbook operator to join the American Gaming Association’s (AGA) “Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly.” public service campaign, which aims to promote responsible sports betting throughout the country. The announcement comes at an appropriate time, March being Problem Gambling Awareness Month.</p>
<p>As part of FanDuel’s commitment to responsible sports betting, the company has made a substantial contribution to the cause. A considerable part of FanDuel’s media inventory, league assets, and team assets will be directed toward spreading the AGA’s message.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sportsbook operator will work alongside its league, team, and media partners to expand the scope of the public service campaign across various media platforms, including digital, radio, television as well as in-venue media.</p>
<p>FanDuel and the AGA hope to launch responsible gaming content live by May 2021.</p>
<p>The AGA’s “Have a Game Plan” campaign is essentially a state-by-state guide that introduces readers to the concept of responsible wagering and gambling addiction. Among other things, the guide informs consumers on the fundamentals of responsible sports betting and on how to identify tell-tale signs of gambling addiction. The guides also include instructions on where to find legal sports betting operators.</p>
<p>Have a Game Plan Promotes Responsibility For Consumers and Operators</p>
<p>FanDuel Group CEO Matt King has affirmed the company’s stance on tackling gambling addiction and promoting healthy wagering habits. According to him, FanDuel believes that promoting responsible gaming behaviors is a core tenet of growing its business and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>In regard to FanDuel’s substantive commitment to the cause, King added that the company also intends on building a consortium of partners to expand the scale of the initiative even further. King also encouraged other online gambling and gaming operators to join FanDuel in the AGA’s campaign.</p>
<p>AGA President and CEO Bill Miller has welcomed FanDuel in the “Have a Game Plan” campaign. According to him, the company’s contribution and commitment could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>Miller said that one of the AGA’s core principles is responsibility to its customers, which is why the association has decided to adapt its approach to the modern sports betting ecosystem. He stressed that an operation of this magnitude would require widespread collaboration with the industry as a whole. This includes gaming operators, media companies as well as leagues and teams, Miller continued.</p>
<p>Proper consumer education is more important than ever. As the US sports betting market continues to grow at unprecedented speeds, consumers need to be informed on how to bet responsibly and recognize the signs of addiction as soon as possible.</p>
