    <h1>How Much Do Dealers Make In Casinos Casino In Evansville Indiana Resort Casinos Hamburg Casino St Cr</h1>

<p>Entain has doubled down on strengthening its staff expertise and knowledge by leveraging technology.</p>
<p>The company has now introduced and launched its Data Academy training program that focuses on the United Kingdom and will seek to train team members as to how to best use data to ensure business success and focus on further STEM1development within the company, including the training of relevant cadre and use of existing and novelty tech, Casino Guru News learned in a public press release.</p>
<p>The idea behind the initiative is to see more Entain employees participate in the training on different levels and benefit in a variety of ways, including driving productivity levels, synergies, and efficiencies, so that both their personal careers and the business in general can move forward.</p>
<p>Data is the buzzword in this new initiative, as attested by Entain Chief Product &amp; Technology Officer Satty Bhens who insists on further exploring this tool on all levels of the company.</p>
<p>"Knowledge of data, and how to apply it, is an incredibly powerful tool – and it’s important for everyone across our business to feel empowered to make the best data-driven decisions," Bhens argues.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bhens is confident that the program would be a boon to the business as well as individual-driven colleagues who are willing to grow their expertise and business acumen through the Data Academy.</p>
<p>Presently, the Data Academy is hosted for up to 20 Entain employees in the United Kingdom, who will be working on strengthening their skills and acquiring new ones. Each Data Academy course is designed to be impactful which will take time, with a single course lasting anything between 13 and 14 months.</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, employees will receive Level 3 Data Technical or Level 4 Data Analyst certification which could help bolster their prospects within the company or beyond.</p>
