<p>Leading lottery company Scientific Games has signed a deal with Latvijas Loto, Latvia’s national lottery operator. The agreement will see Scientific Games provide the lottery firm with its critically-acclaimed AEGIS and WAVE X solutions.</p>
<p>Scientific Games Agrees to Provide Latvijas Loto with Solutions</p>
<p>The two companies will officially begin working together in spring 2023. According to the ten-year deal, Scientific Games will support Latvijas Loto and provide the operator with various maintenance services. In addition, Scientific Games will power the Latvian lottery with AEGIS, its proprietary open architecture enterprise gaming system. Lastly, Latvijas Loto will receive access to the WAVE X retailer point-of-sale terminals.</p>
<p>As a result, the Latvian lottery operator will be able to grow its business while remaining compliant with Latvia’s regulations and responsible gaming objectives. As per the deal, Latvijas Loto will increase its retail shops by 50%.</p>
<p>The deal with Scientific Games is in line with Latvia’s responsible growth initiatives. The country hopes to reduce the impact of problem gaming and to protect Latvian children from exposure to gambling content. Latvia also plans to launch more educational materials on the topic and keep people well-informed.</p>
<p>The Agreement Will Help Latvia’s Lottery Grow Responsibly</p>
<p>Edgars Lediņš, Latvijas Loto’s chairman, said that the company’s board has concluded that it is finally time to upgrade its systems and make them suitable for the modern age. To that end, Scientific Games is a perfect partner that will modernize the Latvian operator’s platforms and help it unfold its full growth potential.</p>
<p>Lediņš noted that his team is excited to modernize its offer and make its operations more efficient. He concluded that he is sure the Latvian retailers are going to love the new terminals and the support they will get.</p>
<p>Pat McHugh, Scientific Games’ chief executive officer, also commented on the matter. He said that his company is honored to work with Latvijas Loto and is glad to have the operator’s trust. McHugh noted that Scientific Games will do everything in its power to help Latvijas Loto grow its business responsibly over the next decade.</p>
<p>In other news, Scientific Games continues to expand its global lottery presence. A few weeks ago, the company secured a new partnership with the Colorado Lottery in the United States. A month earlier, the company inked a new agreement with Ecuador’s national lottery, expanding its presence in the LATAM region. A few days prior to that, Scientific Games penned a five-year extension to its contract with Loto-Québec.</p>
