    <h1>Casino Hotel In Lake Tahoe California Online Casino Ohiya Casino Legend Casino Ojibwa Casino Parx Go</h1>

<p>The Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, has launched cashless gaming on its casino floor, allowing its customers to pay and play without using cash. This would not have been possible without the property’s agreements with payment provider Sightline Payments and gaming products specialist Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Customers Can Now Play Cashless</p>
<p>Thanks to the new agreements, Parx Casino has implemented the Sightline Play+ solution to its Parx Wallet, allowing casino players to play cashless. The wallet app is managed by Light &amp; Wonder’s casino management system which has been deployed across the venue.</p>
<p>The launch of cashless gaming means that Parx visitors will be able to play many games across the property’s vast 260,000-square-foot gaming space without needing to withdraw cash or use chips. This will provide customers with easy access to Parx Casino’s 3,000 slot machines, 200 gaming tables and 50 poker tables.</p>
<p>The new Parx Wallet app is available for customers to download on their mobile devices. Parx Casino explained that customers can join its X-Club loyalty program and set up a Parx Play+ account to play cashless. According to the operator, customers will be able to fuel their accounts through various sources, including debit cards. In addition, Parx Play+ patrons, the casino announced, will be sent Parx+ Discover cards through email, which would allow them to spend their well-earned winning. The card can be used in all shops where Discover is accepted.</p>
<p>Sightline and L&amp;W Made the Launch Possible</p>
<p>The addition of cashless gaming would not have been possible without Sightline and Light &amp; Wonder’s invaluable help. The former company is known as a payments specialist that provides unparalleled cashless solutions that have all the safeguards needed to protect a player’s funds.</p>
<p>Mandi Hart, Sightline’s chief client solutions officer, said that her team is thrilled to launch cashless gaming at Parx Casino. She noted that her company’s Play+ solution has proven to be a best-in-class convenient, safe and secure technology for operators. Hart said that Sightline is excited to transform the gaming industry alongside Parx and Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>Speaking of Light &amp; Wonder, the company’s senior vice president of global gaming systems and service, Jon Wolfe, also shared his thoughts on the launch. He noted that the collaboration with Sightline allows the two companies to deliver modern digital experiences to industry leaders and exceed player expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, Marc Oppenheimer, Parx Casino’s chief marketing officer, shared his thoughts. He is certain that the Parx Wallet will provide the property’s visitors with “tremendous benefits” while ensuring their safety.</p>
<p>The ability to play cashless across our more than 3,000 slot machines with the Parx Wallet and Play+ will provide our customers with easy access to their funds both on and off property. Marc Oppenheimer, CMO, Parx Casino</p>
<p>This summer, the casino also inked an agreement with Kambi, a sportsbook tech supplier.</p>
