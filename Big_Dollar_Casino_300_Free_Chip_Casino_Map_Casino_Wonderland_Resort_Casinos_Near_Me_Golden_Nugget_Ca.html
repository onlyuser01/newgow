This time, however, he’s not fighting Prochazka who’s out due to a shoulder injury. Instead, the Brazilian veteran has a seemingly easier job on his hand – Jamahal Hill (11-1-1).</p>

<p>Glover Teixeira Ready to Get His Championship Belt Back</p>
<p>When he submitted Jan Blachowicz by rear-naked choke in October 2021, Glover Teixeira became the oldest first-time winner in the UFC. Half a year later, the Brazilian grappling expert tried to defend his title for the first time, but it did not go according to his plan.</p>
<p>Even though Teixeira is a 2nd-degree black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, who used to represent Brazil at men’s submission wrestling competitions in the past, his BJJ/wrestling skills failed him in the fight against Jiri Prochazka. The Czech fighter beat him by his own weapon – he defeated Teixeira with a rear-naked choke submission.</p>
<p>The two were supposed to fight again last fall, but Prochazka suffered a shoulder injury which forced him to vacate the title. As a result, Teixeira got himself a new opponent in the form of Jamahal Hill. Although Hill’s not as celebrated as Prochazka in the MMA universe, the two have a lot of similarities, which is why Teixeira needs to take this fight very seriously.</p>
<p>Can Jamahal Hill Conquer UFC in Brazil?</p>
<p>Jamahal Hill is about to have the toughest fight of his life. He’s coming to Rio de Janeiro as the No. 7 in the UFC Light Heavyweight Rankings, with a pro record of 11-1-1. His record in the UFC is 5-1-1, with his most impressive wins being the ones that happened last year. In February, he defeated Johnny Walker by KO; in August, he won by TKO against Thiago Santos.</p>
<p>Those two wins practically put him against Teixeira in the fight for the vacant championship belt. But this fight is going to be his biggest challenge thus far. Not only is the fight taking place on Teixeira’s turf, but the Brazilian is the kind of fighter Hill doesn’t have too much experience fighting against.</p>
<p>Hill prefers to fight on his feet, throwing hard kicks and punches toward his opponents. His BJJ skills are there just to help him prevent his rivals from achieving too much if they take him down. But even that happens rarely – his takedown defense is 69% at the moment.</p>
<p>Truth be told, he still hasn’t fought against too many takedown masters such as Teixeira, who averages 2.20 takedowns per fight. Of all of Hills’ previous opponents, only Jimmy Crute and Darko Stosic have better numbers than Teixeira.</p>
<p>Glover Teixeira vs Jamahal Hill Prediction</p>
<p>UFC 283 looks like a perfect storm for Glover Teixeira. He’s fighting in front of his crowd against the No. 7-ranked fighter in the division. Further, his grappling skills are so superior to those of his next opponent that it would be real strange if he didn’t beat him by submission. That said, we do understand that Hill didn’t get to fight for the title by accident. He’s a great striker, but we doubt he can knock Teixeira out.</p>
