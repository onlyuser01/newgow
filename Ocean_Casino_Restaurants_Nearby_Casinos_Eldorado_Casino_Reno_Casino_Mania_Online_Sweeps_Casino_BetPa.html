    <h1>Ocean Casino Restaurants Nearby Casinos Eldorado Casino Reno Casino Mania Online Sweeps Casino BetPa</h1>

<p>So again, I think it's ridiculous. Who comes up with the idea to pay attention to such conditions? As I said, I haven't had such conditions in any of the other casinos. In principle, if there is a bonus and you use it, then observe these conditions implementation, there is a limit, and so on. But there is no bonus that you emailed me so that I could even look at your site. Because I usually check the emails and if there is something interesting, I look at the casino page. And read me the usual conditions.</p>
<p>It was not I who made an abuse here, but Betpat. If there is no bonus available for a player, he will not be able to use it.</p>
<p>They sent me the email - I checked - bonus was there - I used it.</p>
<p>And that's awesome, the employees shouldn't be familiar with their rules either. Because your employees talk to me-want data to compare, look at my account and nobody has said anything about it.</p>
<p>They tell me how often I can pay out in the week, in the month, how much I can pay out - and still no mention of the fact that I have made "bonus abuse". I even asked which games you can play and which you can't! Madness the abuse of me! I really try everything to cheat a bonus. Ridiculous</p>
<p>Just for you on the subject of bonuses:</p>
<p>The bonus is not there to please the player, but to make it harder for the player to get a payout.</p>
<p>It's stupid of me to take a bonus, but I always only take bonuses when I deposit a little so that I can play longer.</p>
<p>You or the user of the bonus makes life difficult for yourself, you have to implement everything. Then watch out which bets are made - which game is on the shooting list, so it is not allowed to play.</p>
<p>And then another question? When I order a withdrawal, why is the money still in the account? Are you not obliged to immediately remove the arranged money from the customer's player account, because he wants to pay out this amount? And only then make it available again if he cancels the payout?</p>
<p>On the subject of abuse of a bonus.</p>
<p>Abuse only takes place if I have done it consciously. I do some kind of action in the game like in a game to get into a free game, but only continue the free game after the bonus has ended. I consciously used the bonus. Otherwise I would not have paid in. And no, not to abuse anything but just to play - as in any other SERIOUS casino too - Here you have a bonus, have fun with it.</p>
<p>And I certainly didn't do that with the free spins.</p>
<p>What did they do about it?</p>
<p>You send me a bonus by email</p>
<p>I go to your website</p>
<p>Ask what is allowed - which games</p>
<p>Then I use the bonus</p>
<p>Until then - no employee mentions anything of the strange condition - not even about the fact that you as a casino may be able to decide on a payout - that perhaps 10 times as much must be paid out.</p>
<p>Should actually be included in the bonus. But not with you.</p>
<p>As a casino operator, of course, you know your idiotic rule, which actually doesn't make sense, only harms the player. Rarely seen a rule as pointless as yours.</p>
<p>You send me an email about new bonuses - although you know that if I use the bonus, I have definitely already lost.</p>
<p>You take my winnings of 1000 euros, deduct 975 euros and I can have the 25 euros that I paid back. Because I violated the abuse from their point of view.</p>
<p>Strangely, before that, when I made deposits, even though I was abusing bonuses according to their statements, no complaint on your part if I lost everything. Why didn't my money get back?</p>
<p>If I am abusing, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I've already offered it to you once we'll meet in the middle-500 euro-off ready</p>
