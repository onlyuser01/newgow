<p>Canelo to Fight Mundo on December 19</p>
<p>A spectacular and long-awaited fight between the British super-middleweight champion, Callum “Mundo” Smith, and the four-division world champion from Mexico Saul “Canelo” Alvarez will take place on December 19. Switching to the 168-pound division, Canelo will fight for the Super WBA belt held by Smith of the super middleweight division.</p>
<p>To spice things up even more, the WBC has announced last week that the boxers will also fight for the vacant WBC Super-Middleweight title. Consequently, the winner on December 19 will have to fight in 90 days against Avni Yildrim, WBC ranked as #2.</p>
<p>“The WBC is extremely proud to have such tremendous fight for the vacant WBC Super-Middleweight title,” commented WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman</p>
<p>According to WBC President, Mauricio Sulaiman, the Canelo-Callum fight will give the fans superb entertainment and will close a very difficult year. Furthermore, Sulaiman thanked Avni Yildirim for his collaboration to make this happen.</p>
<p>A Clash of Two Titans</p>
<p>Born in Liverpool, Great Britain, Callum John Smith also known as “Mundo” is a professional boxer who has had 27 fights to date. The 30-year old professional boxer so far has 0 losses and 19 KOs.</p>
<p>Smith is taller than Canelo with his 6’3″ and reach of 78″. With that in mind, both Smith and Canelo have previously worn WBC belts. The spotless record of Mundo has gained him the “Diamond” WBC belt which he wore from 2017 to 2019 in the super middleweight division.</p>
<p>Focusing on Canelo, we see a worthy adversary for Smith. Only recently, the professional boxer from Mexico became a free agent. Although he is not as tall as Smith with his 5’8″ and his reach of 70.5″, Canelo to date has had two times more fights than the British boxer.</p>
<p>In Total, Canelo has had 56 fights with 35 KOs. With that in mind, undoubtedly the two boxers are going to bring a spectacular fight on December 19.</p>
