<p>Secure and licensed</p>
<p>Long before esports became the mainstream phenomenon they are today, Betway Esports was already at the forefront of esports betting and the industry as a whole. Betway has sponsored numerous professional esports organizations, and most notably Ninjas in Pyjamas and LGD PSG.</p>
<p>Partnership deals and PR stunts aside, Betway is one of the most diverse sportsbooks that offers a selection of esports betting markets, competitive odds, and various odds boosters. In todayâ€™s Betway Esports review, we will talk about the sportsbook in its entirety, and chiefly, itâ€™s strengths.</p>
<p>Betway features a helpful blog section dedicated to esports entirely, an unambiguous set of Terms &amp; Conditions, the handy Betway Boosts, and a great $30 Free Bet bonus for new customers to try.</p>
<p>Betway Esports Welcome Bonus</p>
<p>Betway Esports has one of the best welcome bonuses in esports. From the moment you enter and register, you can claim a $30 Free Bet esports bonus and use it on any esports you like, as long as you meet the T&amp;Câ€™s.</p>
<p>The bonus is available to new customers only and available in exchange for a $10 deposit. Your first deposit is matched up to $30, but to qualify, for the bonus you must use a debit or credit card only.</p>
<p>Betway Esportsâ€™ Free Bet has a 1x wagering requirement on any esports events so long as the odds you bet on are equal or greater than 1.75.</p>
<p>Betway Esports Promotions</p>
<p>Other promotions covering esports include the Esports Club which allows you to claim a $10 Free Bet every week. To qualify for the offer, players must make a qualifying deposit worth at least $25. The bet must then be spent on two or more selections with combined odds of at least 3.00.</p>
<p>Betway offers a variety of Odds Boosters which apply to individual events and change as soon as an event has been settled to make room for more bonuses. You may or may not opt in to any of the listed bonuses.</p>
<p>Esports Betting Markets</p>
<p>Betway Esports covers a variety of popular markets. Esports bettors will have the opportunity to choose from a number of esports games, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>CS: GO</p>
<p>League of Legends</p>
<p>Dota 2</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege</p>
<p>Overwatch</p>
<p>Betway runs a special Proâ€™s Predictions section to tip you off about potentially worthwhile bets. To make sure you never miss any of the available bets, you can also click on Esports Boosts to find optimized markets for additional value.</p>
<p>Betway In-Play Esports Odds</p>
<p>Similar to live sports, Betway offers in-play betting markets for esports. Live markets are offered at the discretion of the sportsbook, but they often include all major competitions, including:</p>
<p>DreamHack</p>
<p>Blast Pro Series</p>
<p>ESL, Overwatch League</p>
<p>LCS</p>
<p>There are various other League of Legends regional competitions and competitive leagues that are also featured in the in-play selection of markets. The company also sponsors BLAST Premier, DreamHack Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and several esports teams, including Invictus Gaming, BIG, MIBR, and Ninjas in Pyjamas.</p>
<p>Betway comes with a cash-out option, too, allowing you to withdraw your entire or part of your stake if you feel uncertain about the outcome. However, once again, this function is only available at the discretion of Betway Esports.</p>
<p>Betting Rules</p>
<p>Betway offers a comprehensive breakdown of how the betting works. This includes a description of how bets are settled and situations in which bets may be voided. For example, if a tournament is not completed, all outright bets are voided. Betway provides a very detailed explanation of each situation.</p>
<p>Desktop or Mobile</p>
<p>Betway Esports has a dedicated iOS and Android app primarily dedicated to sports. However, consumers interested in esports betting via mobile app will find the solution a handy and quick way to make a bet, claim a bonus, or request a cash-out.</p>
<p>NEW: We now offer LIVE esports match streaming on desktop, mobile and on the Betway app! ðŸ“º</p>
<p>Just look out for the play icon next to the odds on our website!</p>

<p>Registration and Verifying Your Account</p>
<p>To sign up at Betway Esports, you need to follow the instructions outlined in the T&amp;Câ€™s by the website. The main thing is to provide accurate and factual information. Betway Esports is mandated by regulation to verify your identity and for some jurisdictions, this may happen as soon as you have registered.</p>
<p>You could be required to enter a phone number which they send a special code to. All of this is part of the websiteâ€™s Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process designed to ensure that anyone who plays is of the legal age and does so from a jurisdiction where Betway is legally allowed to operate.</p>
<p>Redditâ€™s Verdict</p>
<p>Betway Esports has been discussed on multiple forums, and not least Reddit. As one of the leading websites where esports bettors and fans gather, itâ€™s only natural to consider the opinions of what Redditors have said throughout the years about Betway.</p>
<p>Now, there have only been a few threads on Reddit, and almost all alleged foul play on the part of the operator. In the majority of the cases, however, bettors were unaware of the terms and conditions, and specifically that before requesting a withdrawal with an active bonus, the wagering requirement must be met.</p>
<p>Short of that, there have not been many discussions about Betway Esports, or most esports bookies. One user recommended bet365 over Betway, citing some traction with the operator. Overall, though, we believe Betway is a trustworthy esports operator and one of the forefront runners in the esports betting industry.</p>
<p>Banking Options</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to deposit and withdraw from Betway some of which may be based on your jurisdiction. In general, Betway Esports extends support for over 20 depositing and banking methods each.</p>
<p>You can deposit with debit and credit cards, ecoPayz, Neteller and PayPal, Paysafecard, Giropay, Neosurf, POLi, Qiwi, Astropay, EntroPay, and others. Most of the cash out options overlap with the deposits, including Skrill, Qiwi Wallet, Bank Transfers, and others.</p>
<p>Betway Esports Twitter</p>
<p>Betway Esports has been successfully leveraging social media and Twitter in particular to announce tournament results, the addition of new features, and offering the community a great way to stay connected. The number of Twitter followers has grown progressively since 2016 with 135.8K people now actively following Betway on Twitter alone.</p>
<p>Betway Customer Support</p>
<p>Betway offers several ways of contacting customer support. Bettors will be able to choose from email, live chat, and phone lines. There is a comprehensive help section where you can find answers to anything concerning your Betway account.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can turn to live chat available 24/7 or send an email through the email form. If you insist on calling a landline, there are several phone numbers you may choose from, depending on where you are. They Betway Esports contact numbers are:</p>

<p>Ireland: 1-800-932-847</p>

The website is further certified by eCOGRA, IBAS, and the International Betting Integrity Association, all independent third-parties that uphold the highest standards in esports and sports betting.</p>
