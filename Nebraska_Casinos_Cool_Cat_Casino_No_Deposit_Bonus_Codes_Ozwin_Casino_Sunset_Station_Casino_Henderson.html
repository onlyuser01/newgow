<p>Insight on the $100,000 Birthday Freeroll Poker Tournament</p>
<p>The free-to-enter poker game is available for all new GGPoker players that sign up by entering code BLITZ40 and deposit $10 or more. According to GGPoker, the winner of the tournament will receive a prize of at least $10,000. The winner will also receive a $3,000 buy-in to be used in a “once-in-a-lifetime heads-up series” versus Bilzerian himself. Furthermore, GGPoker revealed that at least 50% of the field will win cash prizes.</p>
<p>If all of this doesn’t sound overwhelming, GGPoker also revealed extra bounty prizes. If a player knocks Blitz out, he or she may win an all-expenses paid trip to Las Vegas for the 2021 summer and even party with him. Moreover, one lucky player who knocks out any other Team GGPoker player, ambassador, GGSquad member, or one of Dan’s special guests may win a Spin &amp; Gold bundle or $1,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Daniel Negreanu, another GGPoker ambassador said that having Blitz join the Team GGPoker is a “huge win”. According to Negreanu, no other poker player has a bigger reach than Blitz.</p>
