<p>So, is our Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich prediction that the hosts will win? Not really, we think that Bayern is unbeatable at this point. But do we think it‚Äôs worth backing Tuchel‚Äôs boys at -143? You‚Äôll have to keep on reading this Der Klassiker preview to find out!</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund Relying on Home Support in Der Klassiker</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund currently has 21 points in the 2023-24 Bundesliga with a 6-3-0 record and a score differential of 20-11. These guys are 4-1-0 at home with 9 goals scored and just 4 conceded, showing that the largest soccer venue in Germany is their fortress where they‚Äôre very hard to beat.</p>

<p>The last time they played against Bayern Munich, they lost 4-2. However, the last time they played against their archrivals at Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, the game ended in a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs certainly something that‚Äôs giving them confidence ahead of the November 4 Der Klassiker, but there‚Äôs one fact that needs to worry them ‚Äì the last time they defeated Bayern in the Bundesliga was in 2018.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich Looking Unstoppable at the Moment</p>
<p>Bayern Munich is without a single loss in all competitions in the last 13 games. In the 2023-24 Bundesliga, Tomas Tuchel‚Äôs men are 7-2-0 with a score differential of 34-7. In their most recent league game, they obliterated Darmstadt 8-0 with all eight goals scored in the second half. Harry Kane was brilliant that day, scoring his second hat-trick since joining Bayern Munich this summer.</p>
<p>üá©üá™üëè Welcome back, Manuel Neuer!</p>
<p>The 37-year-old starts for Bayern today vs Darmstadt for the first time in 10 months. Incredible! ‚ú® pic.twitter.com/qFtGy71ZFk ‚Äî EuroFoot (@eurofootcom) October 28, 2023</p>
<p>Another thing interesting about that game is that the game saw the return of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after a 10-month hiatus due to a broken leg. Neuer is back, but we won‚Äôt see Joshua Kimmich in Der Klassiker. Why? Because he got a red card in the game with Darmstadt just three minutes after the kickoff.</p>
<p>His midfield colleague Leon Goretzka will also miss the Dortmund duel, but on the bright side for Bayern, we‚Äôre likely to see Serge Gnabry making his first Bundesliga appearance since breaking his hand in September.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich Prediction</p>
<p>With Kimmich and Goretzka out, Tuchel doesn‚Äôt have too many holding midfielders at his disposal. But he doesn‚Äôt need them. Instead of holding the ball and controlling the game, Bayern Munich is likely to attack all the time. Sure, this will create space for Dortmund‚Äôs counterattacks, so we might see the hosts scoring as well. Still, we doubt they can score as many as Bayern.</p>
<p>Picks: Bayern Munich to win &amp; over 3.5 goals</p>
