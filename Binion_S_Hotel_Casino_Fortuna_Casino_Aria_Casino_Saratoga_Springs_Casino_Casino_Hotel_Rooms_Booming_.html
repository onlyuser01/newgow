<p>Join the Shifty Dogs’ Quest for “Pure Tail-Wagging Entertainment”</p>
<p>The studio’s director of product, Moritz Blume, spoke about the new release as one that will deliver “pure tail-wagging entertainment and big win potential at all times” to players thanks to their freshest trademarked mechanic, Shift ‘n’ Win. The feature allows game symbols to move across the five reels and generate additional winning combinations that are higher than the standard wins in the game.</p>
<p>To activate it, players need to land a minimum of three Scatter symbols. In return, this will trigger Scatters located on the first and third reels to turn into cash value symbols. Next, with each new spin, both the Scatter and the Value symbols will be seen shifting one reel position to the left.</p>
<p>Once the Value symbol will be seen leaving the first reel, it will be added to the total win multiplier. When the Scatter symbol will leave the reels, the Shift ‘n’ Win feature will come to an end.</p>
<p>Provided players manage to land a new Scatter symbol, the feature will keep going until the respective symbol will exit the grid, attracting an unlimited number of retriggers.</p>
<p>Cash Collect and Double Collect Features</p>
<p>Primarily, players need to focus on helping the dogs break into the pet store, steal the treats, and take off prior to the police getting their paws on them. The action takes place on 10 active paylines on a classic 5×3 grid.</p>
<p>Bonus features like Cash Collect symbols which can land on the fifth reel while engaged in the base game will add together all cash value symbols. Next, a Multiplier will be added to the new value.</p>
<p>By landing the Double Collect symbol, players will get their hands on double payouts for more tail-wagging excitement.</p>
<p>In May, Booming Games announced it would expand in Colombia and the LatAm region with the help of a fresh partnership inked with Rivalo, a local Colombian operator.</p>
