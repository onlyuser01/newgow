    <h1>Best Casino In Oklahoma Free Casino No Deposit Atlantis Casino Resort Stream Casino Monticello Ny Ca</h1>

<p>DAZN has teamed up with GeoComply to give a boost to its safeguards against fraud and spoofing. The company is opting into GeoComply’s signature GeoGuard technology which will give the prominent brand better protection against unauthorized activities, such as the use of Proxies, Tors, and VPNs to access its products and offer.</p>
<p>As one of the leading streamers of sports content, DAZN has more than 20m premium subscribers from across 200 markets, which has made the company even more ambitious about protecting its platform and offer. GeoComply on the other hand is a firm with a sterling track record in protecting companies, mostly in the sports gambling space, from unauthorized access through geo-blocking solutions that effectively reduce fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>GeoGuard is not picked randomly either. The solution leverages a powerful algorithm that is able to track 98% of all anonymous IPs and leverages an ultra-low false positive rate, with GeoComply making sure that partners receive hourly updates.</p>
<p>Overall, the solution protects partner operators, such as DAZN and sportsbooks, from fraud, and piracy, and raises the compliance bar across the bar.</p>
<p>DAZN CTO Sandeep Tiku has welcomed the arrival of the solution and said that his company is committed to leveraging the best tools to protect its business, arguing that the streams provided by DAZN are about some of the biggest and most important sports events.</p>
<p>GeoGuard further helps the company ensure that it is protected and Tiku added that DAZN was delighted to be collaborating with GeoComply. GeoComply General Manager, Media &amp; Entertainment James Clark was similarly happy with the opportunity to work with DAZN.</p>
<p>GeoGuard can be trusted with protecting DAZN’s popular sports content and streams, he explained, confident of the successful collaboration between the companies. DAZN also operates a sportsbook division, DAZN Bet, which is a fairly new entrant into the market and has been slowly scaling up.</p>
<p>In the meantime, GeoComply has been building its reputation as a robust supplier of compliance solutions for the gambling industry. The company has improved its own operations through the recent acquisition of OneComply, a firm that makes it easier to follow brand licensing obligations across different jurisdictions and a great addition to GeoComply’s own product offering.</p>
<p>Similarly, GeoComply has been providing comprehensive reports about individual markets, helping stakeholders better understand the challenges and risks of not having adequate geo-location software and other compliance and safety features.</p>
