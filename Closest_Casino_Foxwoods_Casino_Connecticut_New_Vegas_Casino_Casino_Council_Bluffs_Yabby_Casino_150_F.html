    <h1>Closest Casino Foxwoods Casino Connecticut New Vegas Casino Casino Council Bluffs Yabby Casino 150 F</h1>

<p>On Wednesday, the South Dakota Commission on Gaming listened to a state government official explain the future gambling on sports at Deadwood casinos. The commission also decided to move the Fort Pierre horse races to October.</p>
<p>David Wiest Takes the Floor</p>
<p>On Wednesday, David Wiest, the deputy secretary of the state Department of Revenue, briefed gaming commissioners on the legislative process. He explained that two competing proposals had to be rejected.</p>
<p>Wiest said the bill that the Senate State Affairs Committee amended is the exact same one that now awaits Governor Kristi Noem’s approval. He reiterated that he and his department want “a good solid system in place” and are waiting for the governor to sign the set bill.</p>
<p>According to Wiest, after voters approved Amendment B, department officials discussed the architectural framework and potential rule proposals.</p>
<p>The executive secretary of the commission and her staff will recommend rules for the committee to review at a public hearing, after which the rules will be adopted and presented to the Legislature’s oversight committee for final approval.</p>
<p>Similar to previous commission meetings held in March, June, September, and December 2020, the commission did not talk about the possible rules of establishing a sports betting gambling framework in the state. The next commission meet-up is scheduled for June 16.</p>
<p>No to Betting outside of Deadwood Casinos</p>
<p>Rep. Mark Willadsen’s HB 1211 proposal was rejected 9-4 votes in the House State Affairs Committee, while the South Dakota Department of Revenue endorsed SB 44, which allows sports betting to take place only on the premises of casinos in Deadwood.</p>
<p>Wiest opposed HB 1211 because that would allow alcohol-selling establishments the opportunity to take wagers outside of Deadwood casinos, driving away business. Wiest further expressed his concerns that another proposal, HB 1231, would enable mobile betting, which people would be able to use from anywhere in South Dakota.</p>
<p>According to Wiest, if HB 1211 passes, more than 1,000 new venues such as municipal, county bars, convention centers, and full-service restaurants accept wagers.</p>
<p>Wiest also told the committee that technology allows everybody to make bets statewide. That alone is against what people have voted for. He argued that technology doesn’t change what is written in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dates for the live horse-racing meet, the Verendrye Benevolent Association, have been moved. The event that will be held at the Stanley County Fairgrounds was originally planned to take place on September 25-26 is now moved to October 2-3.</p>
<p>The general manager and association vice president, Shane Kramme, requested the change because of recent issues with the previous date.</p>
