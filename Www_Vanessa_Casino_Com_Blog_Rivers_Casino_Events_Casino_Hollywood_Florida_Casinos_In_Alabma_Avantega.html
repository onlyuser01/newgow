<p>PlayStar Appoints Jon Bowden as CMO to Help it Rise above the Noise</p>
<p>PlayStar, a challenger online casino brand, continues to pursue differentiation in the US market. Hellbent on success, the company has appointed industry heavyweight Jon Bowden to the position of chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>Bowden Will Help PlayStar Outmatch Its Rivals</p>
<p>Bowden is an experienced gambling industry professional who will help PlayStar achieve its goals. The specialist boasts years of experience in the gambling sector and has worked in marketing positions for multiple notable companies.</p>
<p>Prior to joining PlayStar’s quest to disrupt the US gambling market, Bowden used to work for multiple companies in the industry. His career began in The Rank Group where he served as senior marketing manager. This tenure was followed by a short stint as the senior brand marketing manager at Gala Coral Group, after which Bowden moved to Ladbrokes Coral.</p>
<p>The specialist served as the latter’s head of brand and performance marketing for two years and then settled in GVC Group, where he directed the Foxy brand. Around the same time GVC rebranded to Entain, Bowden was appointed as the brand director of the Gala brand and managed Gala Bingo, Gala Casino, and Gala Spins.</p>
<p>As the chief marketing officer of PlayStar, Bowden’s mission will be to promote the brand, lead the marketing team and reinforce the M&amp;A efforts. He will also be responsible for assisting the brand with its launch in New Jersey and other future market launches.</p>
<p>PlayStar’s CEO Knows Bowden Can Do It</p>
<p>Bowden lauded PlayStar as a brand that takes innovation to heart. He emphasized that the company offers some of the most unique gambling experiences and caters to people who wish to enjoy playing online casino games.</p>
<p>Because of this, Bowden is delighted to join the company and have the opportunity to turn its goals into reality. He added that with such a convincing mission, incredible team, and powerful USPs, PlayStar is poised for success.</p>
<p>Per Hellberg, the chief executive officer of PlayStar, welcomed Bowden to the company, lauding his vast experience:</p>
<p>“Jon is one of the most experienced marketers in the industry and his appointment as PlayStar CMO will undoubtedly prove vital in our mission to disrupt the US market.” PlayStar CEO Per Hellberg</p>
<p>Hellberg pointed out that the US betting market tends to be “ferociously competitive,” which is why PlayStar needs to rise above the noise and engage its players right away.</p>
<p>He is convinced that Bowden has what it takes to help PlayStar reach such levels of engagement. Hellberg concluded by saying that he is excited to have the new CMO on board and is looking forward to launching PlayStar in more states. In November 2021, PlayStar also acquired a new chief financial officer.</p>
