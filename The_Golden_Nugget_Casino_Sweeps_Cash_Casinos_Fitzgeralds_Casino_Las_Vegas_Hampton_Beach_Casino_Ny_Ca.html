<p>Thanks for your confirmation, Miidelgado.</p>
<p>According to the casino's terms and conditions:</p>
<p>We reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to void any winnings and forfeit any balance in your betting account, to terminate the Agreement and/or to suspend the provision of the Services or deactivate your account if: we identify you have disguised, or interfered, or taken steps to disguise or interfere, in any way with the IP address of any Device used to access our Site (such as using a Virtual Private Network "VPN").</p>
<p>Please understand the problem with using the VPN is that you might be involuntarily connected to another IP address that is related to a different casino account in the same gambling establishment, hence, it seems as if you created multiple accounts from one IP address. Or, on the other hand, a player might be using VPN to hide that they’re accessing the casino’s website from a restricted jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If the games you played from restricted jurisdiction, were not visible to you unfortunately we won't object to your winnings being confiscated.</p>
<p>I can only advise you to take extra precautions in the future when it comes to VPN usage in online casinos. Casinos often have two kinds of rules in their terms and conditions that might cause you issues. Either the casino has a flat ban on using systems that mask your IP(including a VPN) or they only disallow such usage to circumvent the blocking of restricted countries. This includes cases when you use VPN to gain access to games and game providers that are otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>Restrictions on games are determined by game providers, and the casino might not have a license for the said game in your country.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into issues with any online casino in the future.</p>
