    <h1>Casino Slot Machine Ruleta Casino Isleta Resort Casino Boulder Station Casino Lucky Tiger Casino GiG</h1>

<p>Portugal, in particular, provides one of the “most robust regulatory online gaming frameworks in Europe” and a “resolute taxation structure,” according to GiG</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has unveiled the launch of the online sports betting operator Betway in Portugal. Powered by GiG’s award-winning iGaming platform and sportsbook, Betway is the supplier’s second B2B partner in the country.</p>
<p>Portugal, both companies believe, offers significant growth opportunities to operators. The country’s revenues continued to increase in 2022, hitting a new record. This tendency has made the market much more appealing to big casino operators.</p>
<p>As announced, Betway is GiG’s first operator partner under the stewardship of former DraftKings and SBTech executives, Andrew Cochrane and Richard Carter. The two are now serving as GiG’s CBO and CEO, respectively, strengthening GiG’s underlying top-tier credentials. These veterans’ expertise would be key in delivering commercial growth, GiG believes.</p>
<p>The move expands GiG’s list of tier 1 partners in regulated jurisdictions, allowing it to increase its European presence. Portugal, in particular, provides one of the “most robust regulatory online gaming frameworks in Europe” and a “resolute taxation structure,” according to GiG. Because of this, innovative solutions, such as GiG’s, are in high demand.</p>
<p>GiG’s products are focused on driving player acquisition and retention and provide the company’s operator partners with opportunities to bolster their profitability. Thanks to that, the company was able to secure EGR’s Full Service Platform and Multi-Channel Supplier awards in 2023.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Support the Companies’ Expansion in Portugal</p>
<p>Andrew Cochrane, Gaming Innovation Group’s chief business officer, commented on the new deal, saying that he is proud that his team has developed such a close partnership with Betway. Cochrane praised Betway as a leading tier 1 operator and added that his team is glad to have developed a robust product for the Portuguese regulated market.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time to be a part of GiG, as we continue to invest in our product and technology capabilities to underpin further Tier 1 client wins and provide existing clients with ever more compelling product features. Andrew Cochrane, CBO, GiG</p>
<p>Betway’s chief executive officer, Anthony Werkman, also commented on the matter, thanking GiG for underpinning its ambitious growth strategy for Portugal. According to him, the partnership will benefit both companies’ expansion in this market.</p>
<p>As part of our ambitious growth strategy for Portugal in 2024, this GiG platform will help play a role in expediting our objectives to elevate the sports betting experience for existing Betway customers in Portugal and appealing to new ones. Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway</p>
<p>In other news, GiG just completed its acquisition of KaFe Rocks and set out to become a leading casino affiliate company.</p>
