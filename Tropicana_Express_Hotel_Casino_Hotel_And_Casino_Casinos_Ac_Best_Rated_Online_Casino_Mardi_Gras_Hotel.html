    <h1>Tropicana Express Hotel Casino Hotel And Casino Casinos Ac Best Rated Online Casino Mardi Gras Hotel</h1>

<p>I haven't seen here anything that we could help you with so far. I am sorry, but if this doesn't change, we will be forced to reject your complaint.</p>
<p>UKGC license is necessary for those casinos which want to operate on UK market (targeting the UK) but if the casino does not target UK market with their commercials (do not offer GBP currency, bonuses for UK players etc.) and their license authority allows it, they can accept UK players, they are just not protected by UKGC .</p>
<p>In this case your wife lost money and the casino decided to refund part of her money, which was really generous gesture, because no other casino, not even those licensed by UKGC, wouldn't give back your deposits in case you lose fairly! (Not to mention the fact, that she was asked not to make a complaint, but you did instead).</p>
<p>If you lost fairly, you have no right for refund . If the casino accepts your bet, they should also pay your winning even if you are from a restricted country. After the casino pays out the winnings to the player, his account should be closed. The casino should not take players from restricted countries, but if something like this would happened (they let you play and win), we believe your winnings should be paid as well. Also, please understand the fact, that you as a player accept the casino's T&amp;C by creating a new account and it is your responsibility to act accordingly to those T&amp;Cs as well, not only the casino.</p>
<p>Second of all - accepting a player from restricted country. Here is our standpoint:</p>
<p>As long as the casino didn't know about gambling addiction, there is nothing we can do for you.</p>
<p>In your case, I still don't know if your wife asked the casino to close her account or for self-exclusion, and you are avoiding to clarify this. If your wife asked for self-exclusion, please send me a valid proof of this and we will try our best to help - otherwise our hands are tied in this situation and opening of the account was in fact perfectly fine.</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed in this, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agree not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (After cooling off period and this cannot be done for players whos are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling. What player can do if he is unhappy in the casino:</p>
<p>Please, let me explain all the necessery points I think you need to know in this message.</p>
<p>Hi Stewart,</p>
<p>Please, let me explain all the necessery points I think you need to know in this message.</p>
<p>First of all, the self-exclusion problem.</p>
<p>Some casinos use lots of tools for responsible gambling. What player can do if he is unhappy in the casino:</p>
<p>Close the account or self-exclude himself, that's the two basic choices.</p>
<p>Closing an account is simple and has almost none impact - the player can reopen account anytime, and casino has no obligation to the player.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-exclusion does. If the player successfully makes a self-exclusion the casino agree not to open this account or if yes only under particular circumstances. (After cooling off period and this cannot be done for players whos are addicted/with gambling problem).</p>
<p>In the case of self-exclusion, if casino failed in this, the player may ask for a refund.</p>
<p>In your case, I still don't know if your wife asked the casino to close her account or for self-exclusion, and you are avoiding to clarify this. If your wife asked for self-exclusion, please send me a valid proof of this and we will try our best to help - otherwise our hands are tied in this situation and opening of the account was in fact perfectly fine.</p>
<p>As long as the casino didn't know about gambling addiction, there is nothing we can do for you.</p>
<p>Second of all - accepting a player from restricted country. Here is our standpoint:</p>

<p>And now the last point - the license.</p>
<p>UKGC license is necessary for those casinos which want to operate on UK market (targeting the UK) but if the casino does not target UK market with their commercials (do not offer GBP currency, bonuses for UK players etc.) and their license authority allows it, they can accept UK players, they are just not protected by UKGC.</p>
