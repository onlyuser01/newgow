<p>Boston-based daily fantasy and sports book operator DraftKings announced it launched a stand-alone casino app in New Jersey. The company which recently completed a three-way merger with technology provider SBTech started leveraging its in-house technology to develop its new casino app and create a more holistic product suite paired with dynamic experience for gamers. The casino app will feature DraftKings exclusive-only games, as well as some revamped all-time classics such as blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>DraftKings Utilizing In-House Technology</p>
<p>The operator which launched an online casino in Pennsylvania in April, found out in a recent study that 70% of its casino customers place their first bet on DraftKings-branded games, a fact that further exemplifies the demand for developing own gaming products, to complement customizable interface with unique customer experience.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to break new ground for DraftKings in the gaming space today with the launch of our DraftKings Casino app, the Company’s first perennial product that operates year-round irrespective of the annual sports schedules.” Jason March, Vice President of Gaming, DraftKings</p>
<p>The gaming operator outlined that this standalone version of DraftKings casino is a result of extensive research and preparation, despite one DraftKings casino already being available through the sportsbook app in the state since 2018. The online casino operator is willing to expand the scope of its new casino app into other states where regulations allow.</p>
<p>“Following our debut in the Garden State, we look forward to continued innovation, nationwide expansion where regulations allow, and to further positioning DraftKings as an all-inclusive gaming and entertainment experience.” Jason March, Vice President of Gaming, DraftKings</p>
<p>The new DraftKings casino app will offer popular slot and table games, in addition to games from third party providers such as IGT, Slingo, Scientific Games and others, as well as 24/7 access to the custom DraftKings Live Studio.</p>
<p>The daily fantasy and sports book operator is looking to diversify its offering, entering the iGaming space, a move probably prompted by the effects on sports during the virus-related health crisis. In New Jersey, the online casino vertical continued to post significant growth, as May figures revealed a 124.1% rise in revenue year-on-year, to $85.9 million. During that period, however, the sports betting vertical was down 36.2%, to $9.9 million, due to the total suspension of all major US leagues, as well as cancellations of major sporting events on a worldwide scale.</p>
