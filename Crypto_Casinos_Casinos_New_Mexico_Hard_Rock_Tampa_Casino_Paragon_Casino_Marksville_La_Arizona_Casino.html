    <h1>Crypto Casinos Casinos New Mexico Hard Rock Tampa Casino Paragon Casino Marksville La Arizona Casino</h1>

<p>I signed up a week ago to bet sports at Sportbet.one. Yesterday I transferred USDT $1000 to their live dealer casino. Within 45 minutes of playing live dealer blackjack I ran that up to $14,705. When I tried to transfer my casino balance back to the sportsbook it went under review for 12 hours, after which time they transferred just my original $1000 back to the sportsbook and removed all my winnings, sending me the following explanation by email:</p>
<p>Your casino session #55516 was canceled after the results of the provider's investigation.</p>
<p>The official response of the provider:</p>
<p>Checked the player's gameplay for signs of fraudulent activity. The investigation found that the user benefits by using shuffle tracking and card counting techniques.</p>
<p>You also violated several basic rules of our platform:</p>
<p>The betting company reserves the right to revoke the concluded betting agreement (including the bets placed before and after the beginning of the event), refuse to fulfill its obligations under this agreement (including paying out the winnings), or refuse to return any placed bets , if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bets are made by a group of clients acting in a coalition to bypass the restrictions established by the betting company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the client is suspected of using any software that automates the process of setting bets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the client uses the game account to play in arbitration situations;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The full text of the rules can be found here: https://sportbet.one/rules.</p>
<p>This time we are refunding your deposit and strongly recommend you to follow our platform rules.</p>
<p>Firstly, I did not engage in any "shuffle tracking" or "counting techniques". Here is the debit/credit history of each hand and a video where I go through the entire 89 hand history of the session so there can be complete transparency of the hands I played and the bet amounts I made.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about advantage blackjack play but I’ve seen enough movies to know that it’s a long grind and you would dramatically change your bet size based on the count of the deck. You can see by my debit/credit history that my session was short (45 minute), and I started off betting $500/hand and varied it by no more than $100-$200 per hand up to a maximum of $1000 a hand. Also you can see by my hand history that I won 13 of my first 17 hands of the session which accounted for the bulk of my winnings, and the pattern I exhibit is betting slightly more after a run of consecutive losses and slightly less after a run of consecutive wins. There would have been a few card shuffle changes within this session but that was the consistent pattern I exhibited and my bet size did not materially change due to any other factors throughout my session.</p>
<p>Also out of the 89 blackjack hands I played I experienced a net loss in 46 of them and a net gain in just 43 of them. Where I did experience winnings were on side bets such as "perfect pair" and "rummy", which no advantage player would participate in. I placed roughly 20% of my blackjack stake on each and every hand on these side bets and just got lucky there.</p>
<p>So after they get this bogus explanation from the gaming supplier they cite several rules that I would have broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bets are made by a group of clients acting in a coalition to bypass the restrictions established by the betting company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the client is suspected of using any software that automates the process of setting bets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the client uses the game account to play in arbitration situations;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these rules: 1) syndicate play, 2) automated betting software, 3) arbitrage are all related to SPORTS BETTING. These have nothing to do with the casino play or what they are falsely accused me of, nor do they have any other rules on the matter. So even if I was doing some sort of advantage play in the casino, (which I wasn’t!), they don’t even have specific rules against it. They are simply making up accusations then applying unrelated rules to avoid having to pay out legitimate winners.</p>
