<p>Los Angeles Rams Unveil Pick ‘Em Mobile App, Could be Predictive Gaming Precursor</p>

<p>The Los Angles Rams, one of two National Football League franchises in the second-largest US city, said Friday the team launched a free mobile game called “Rams Pick ‘Em” that tests fans’ knowledge of players and football situations over the course of a live game.</p>

<p>Rams Pick ‘Em will debut for the team’s preseason game today against the Oakland Raiders and will continue throughout the season. The Rams lost to the New England Patriots in last season’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Players compete to win exclusive prizes for each game, including two tickets and pregame field passes to an upcoming Rams home game, as well as autographed merchandise,” said the team in a statement.</p>
<p>Translation: Rams Pick ‘Em participants, no matter proficient they are at the game, will not be eligible for cash prizes. However, there is speculation that Rams Pick ‘Em could set the stage for the team to eventually offer some form of live predictive gaming with real money on the line.</p>
<p>Trending In That Direction</p>
<p>As Casino.org reported on Tuesday, the Washington Redskins, in conjunction with NBC Sports Washington Plus, became the first NFL franchise to roll out a predictive gaming product with real money involved.</p>
<p>“Predict the Game” debuted for the Redskins’ Aug. 8 preseason clash against the Cleveland Browns, allowing participants to win up to $1,000 per quarter by answering questions directly related to the game. The feature will be available to fans for the Redskins’ three remaining exhibition games, but is not expected to be around for the regular season.</p>
<p>Although cash prizes aren’t involved, Rams Pick ‘Em uses a methodology similar to Predict the Game by challenging fans with game-related questions and “micro outcomes.” Examples would be “What team throws a touchdown pass first?” or “Which of the following player notches a sack first?”</p>
<p>The NFL and its owners are not as opposed to sports wagering as they may have been five or 10 years ago. But the league has signaled it will approach the growing sports betting market with caution. That said, there are benefits for the league and its owners in embracing sports wagering.</p>
<p>Data confirm that bettors with action on games are more likely to watch those games on television than fans who are not financially invested in a particular outcome. Television viewing rights paid to the NFL by networks such as CBS, ESPN, and Fox are a major driver of revenue. Last year, the league generated between $16 billion and $17 billion in revenue, of which $8.78 billion was distributed to the 32 franchises, with the bulk of those sums coming from TV rights.</p>
<p>Owner’s Got Experience</p>
<p>The Rams being one of the first NFL teams to test a predictive gaming product, even though it doesn’t yet involve real money, isn’t surprising. Owner Stan Kroenke also controls Arsenal of the English Premier League (EPL), a league where fans have widely embraced in-game betting.</p>
<p>According to some reports, Kroenke and the Glazer family, owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the EPL’s Manchester United, have been helping fellow NFL owners understand the complexities of in-game and predictive betting.</p>
