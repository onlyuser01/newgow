    <h1>Four Bears Casino And Lodge Emerald Queen Casino And Hotel East R Street Tacoma Wa Seminole Casino F</h1>

<p>Dear Yuliia,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Self-prohibition</p>
<p>If you need to take a break from gambling, we are able to temporarily suspend your account on your request. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed for a minimum period of 6 months, and will not be reactivated under any circumstances during the exclusion period. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request. A written request (after 6 months has elapsed) is required before account re-opening can be considered.</p>
<p>Send an email to support@pin-up.team from the email address you used to open your account stating "Voluntary Blocking" in the subject field and "I request you to block my account" in the text field. Your account will be blocked within one business day."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to support@pin-up.team. In this way, you’ll have proof of such action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
