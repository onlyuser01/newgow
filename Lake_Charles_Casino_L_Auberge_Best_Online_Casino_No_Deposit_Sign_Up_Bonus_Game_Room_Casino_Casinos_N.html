<p>The Game Title Features the Famous Dream Drop Bonus Feature</p>
<p>Relax Gaming’s latest title features the famous Dream Drop Bonus. Online players can trigger this functionality during a base game spin by hitting five Dream Drop symbols. Once the feature is activated, players have the chance of winning one out of five jackpots. The jackpots feature different levels including Rapid, Mini, Maxi, Major or Mega.</p>
<p>During the Dream Drop Bonus round, players need to reveal three symbols matching the same jackpot out of a total of 15 options. Selecting a card reveals a jackpot symbol and once the player matches three of the same, they are awarded the jackpot and the round ends.</p>
<p>Wilds, Splitter and Free Spins</p>
<p>Besides the legendary Dream Drop Bonus, Grim the Splitter Dream Drop offers wilds, splitter as well as free spins. The game developer explained that if a wild lands on the reel “it is split in two, duplicating the symbols that have already landed – it’s even possible to split every single reel at once.”</p>
<p>And then there’s the Splitter Feature, a unique functionality that gives players a chance for higher prizes. The feature, according to Relax Gaming, can award the players a win of up to 20 symbols and can be stored up to three times on each of the reels.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Bonus Symbols award the players with seven free spins. Whenever a player lands an additional Bonus Symbol, they are awarded an additional spin.</p>
<p>A Game Unlike Anything Else Seen Before</p>
<p>Simon Hammon, Relax Gaming’s CEO, said that the newest slot title is unique and offers an experience, unlike any other product in the industry. He predicted that the innovative mechanic that enables reel splitting will be well-received by the players. Finally, Hammon acknowledged that Grim the Splitter Dream Drop features a spookier tone but at the same time offers funny and engaging experiences.</p>
<p>“Grim the Splitter is unlike anything we have created before or that we’ve even seen on the market.“ Simon Hammon, CEO of Relax Gaming</p>
<p>As a leading developer of games for the growing iGaming industry, Relax Gaming currently offers more than 4,000 casino titles. The developer’s games feature unique functionalities and options making them entertaining and engaging for online players.</p>
