    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Ohkay Casino Z Casino Doubledown Casino Slots Casino</h1>

<p>Dear kevin040195,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for your account closure? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be blocked and the reason why?</p>
<p>https://www.spinsamurai.com/en/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>„You can implement a cooling off period at Spin Samurai by contacting our support team who can advise you on how to request time off from gaming. During this time you will not be able to fund your account or play any games nor will you receive any casino marketing or promotional offers from us.</p>
<p>You can control how long you want the cooling off period to last and it can start from as little as a week or last up to 1 month, 3 months or even 6 months should you feel the need.</p>
<p>Temporarily disable your account with self-exclusion</p>
<p>If you know from the start that you are going to have certain gambling issues or you are just afraid that you are already not able to find a middle ground between how much you want to play and how much you actually can, then you may want to choose to exclude yourself from gambling at our casino.</p>
<p>This preventive measure can be activated by our Support via Live Chat for you. If you're worried that you can lose control over yourself while gambling, please contact our Support and we will try to help you."</p>
<p>Is this the email address that you have sent your email to? support@spinsamurai.com</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
