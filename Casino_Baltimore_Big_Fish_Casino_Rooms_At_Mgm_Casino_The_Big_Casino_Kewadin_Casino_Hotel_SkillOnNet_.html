    <h1>Casino Baltimore Big Fish Casino Rooms At Mgm Casino The Big Casino Kewadin Casino Hotel SkillOnNet</h1>

<p>Prestigious online iGaming platform SkillOnNet has expanded its presence in the Latin American market with the recent launch of a Mexican PlayUZU casino alternative. Mexico’s Dirección General de Juegos y Sorteos has issued the license that allows SkillOnNet to introduce its powerhouse brand to the country with the largest number of Spanish speakers in the world.</p>
<p>The new casino is a fully localized, Mexican version of the successful Spanish-based platform currently available in Spain and other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>The Mexican PlayUZU Offer</p>
<p>PlayUZU.mx will introduce Mexican players to the same fair casino that has ensured the success of its PlayOJO sister site in a number of regulated markets in Europe. Last May, the brand also announced its debut on the American market as part of a market access deal with Caesars Entertainment. Some of the most defining and eye-catching features of the casino are its zero-wagering policy and the OJOplus cashback option in real-time on all bets.</p>
<p>Mexican casino aficionados will also benefit from an array of domestic banking options, including CashLib, Directa24, Paysafecard, and Trustly. The casino also displays a rich selection of local games from reputable software providers such as Microgaming, Evolution, Thunderkick, or NextGen Gaming.</p>
<p>SkillOnNet uses an exclusive casino-based type of approach while delivering a unique player experience. This helps the brand be a reputable mass market and gender-inclusive player that plans on turning into the go-to destination for casual casino players.</p>
<p>Video bingo games also record huge success rates in Mexico. PlayUZU is seeking to seize this opportunity and also create a fully localized P2P bingo alternative for Mexicans.</p>
<p>PlayUZU’s Arrival in Mexico Backed by a TV Ad Campaign and Local Influencers</p>
<p>SkillOnNet’s head of corporate development Maor Nutkevitch expressed the brand’s enthusiasm for making its debut in Mexico. Nutkevitch also stated the group is feeling confident that it will manage to quickly secure “substantial market share” across the Latin American region. Their optimism is fueled by the undeniable success of their other Spanish-based platforms, respectively, PlayUZU and Bacanaplay in Spain and Portugal. Last July, SkillOnNet and Tom Horn Gaming signed an important partnership bringing quality Tom Horn-powered games to players in Portugal.</p>
<p>Hoping to replicate its impressive penetration rates and revenues in other Spanish-speaking countries, SkillOnNet will be using a creative communication strategy to drive significant brand awareness in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Plus, PlayUZU’s official launch in the country is also backed by an impressive number of local social media influencers, as well as a huge TV ad campaign with an impressive budget.</p>
<p>PlayUZU has been a constant and important presence on the iGaming market since its creation in 2020. Following the launch of the PlayUZU.mx platform, Mexican players can expect to find numerous advantages and offer specially tailored for their needs, including a fully comprehensive selection of top games, quick payments, and excellent compatibility across all platforms.</p>
<p>All games are available in Flash mode. Popular brands such as PlayMillion, Play Ojo Queen Vegas Casino, and Masked Singer are PlayUZU’s sister casinos.</p>
