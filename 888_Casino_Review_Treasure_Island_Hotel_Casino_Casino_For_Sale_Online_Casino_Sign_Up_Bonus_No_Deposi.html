    <h1>888 Casino Review Treasure Island Hotel Casino Casino For Sale Online Casino Sign Up Bonus No Deposi</h1>

<p>Scotland could soon become the first nation to ban greyhound racing in the United Kingdom, marking a break with tradition and marking a big focus on animal rights, The Times of London reported. There are presently 25 race tracks all across the United Kingdom, and while the majority of those is located in England, a ban in Scotland would definitely have a ripple effect and give activists momentum in trying to limit the races elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cannot Teach Old Dogs New Tricks, So Letâ€™s Wrap It Up</p>
<p>Greyhound racing, and horse racing in general, have been often linked to animal exploitation, an argument that is passionately upheld by many animal welfare organizations, and conscientious consumers. However, no nation which has strong ties to the sport has made such a clear statement about its own industry as Scotland is now preparing to. A petition to suspend greyhound racing and ban it completely has already been backed by 130,000 signatures.</p>
<p>There is compelling evidence to seek the prohibition of the sport as well, as data from the Greyhound Board of Great Britain confirms that there were more than 3,000 racing deaths in the period between 2017 and 2020. This excludes the report of 18,345 injuries that took place. A vote is supposedly planned for today.</p>
<p>According to Sage, a charity, chairwoman Gill Docherty, dogs in the industry are mistreated and they live in deplorable conditions that cannot be excused or improved upon, and that is why the activity itself would need to disappear. The United Kingdom is not the only place where the sport is beginning to peter out whether because of social objection to the institution itself or because of alternative forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>Greyhound Racing Is a Dying Breed</p>
<p>In the United States, there have been states to go so far as to prohibit greyhound racing, including Florida, and most are following the same track. Both Arkansas and Iowa are now phasing out the sport as well and will no longer allow it from January 1, 2023 onward. However, not everyone agrees. Thornton racetrack owner Paul Brignal commented for The Times that there have only been two serious injuries in 2020 so far, and one dog had died, but accidents do happen in any sport.</p>
<p>Docherty though also raised a point that many dogs in the industry were doped with cocaine in order to make them run faster, once again raising ethical issues with the industry, which could soon be its undoing.</p>
