<p>Clarion Gaming’s managing director Stuart Hunter rejoiced in the success of this year’s Global Gaming Expo (G2E) that took place from October 10 to October 14 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>G2E Back to Pre-Pandemic Glory</p>
<p>Stuart Hunter, who heads Clarion Gaming, the company responsible for the major gambling industry event ICE London, has highlighted the importance of in-person events for the development of the gambling industry praising the great success of this year’s edition of the G2E that took place at The Venetian Expo in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Clarion Gaming had a considerable presence at the international gambling event, which goes to show the significance such events have for the various stakeholders in the gambling industry, which are able to showcase their products, strike new partnerships and discuss important topics and innovations.</p>
<p>Hunter shared more on the company’s experience with G2E: “We had a great G2E and the feedback from everyone we spoke to was that they were delighted to be back on a busy show floor and that they were already preparing for London in February. A successful G2E represents great news for the global industry and after Vegas, all roads lead to London and ICE!”</p>
<p>Hunter also congratulated the organizers for the great work and the positivity they put into an inspiring event.</p>
<p>Additionally, Clarion Gaming’s representatives took an active part in the ICE Symposium, which took place at Top Golf Las Vegas to great attendance and success.</p>
<p>The event was organized in collaboration with the European Casino Association and focused on topics, which are key to the businesses in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>This Las Vegas edition focused on the acquisition and retention of talented employees, there were discussions on the regulatory model in the US, which is created for retail casinos, and how it should be changed in order to cater to the needs of new technologies and products and much more.</p>
<p>The Success of G2E Forebodes a Great ICE London</p>
<p>After such a packed G2E, Hunter also expects a great turnout at the ICE London event, which will take place from February 7 to February 9, 2023.</p>
<p>The 2023 edition will see all industry brands back on the ICE London show floor after two years of COVID restrictions thwarting the event from being executed at full scale.</p>
<p>It is only October but 85% of stand spaces are already sold out and demand is high. Exhibitors from 2022 will be returning again in 2023 with even bigger and more impressive stands.</p>
<p>In 2022, ICE London succeeded in gathering 410 exhibitors, which came from 59 different countries. Next year this number is expected to rise even further.</p>
<p>Hunter has highlighted that the 2023 edition of ICE London is expected to be the largest and most prominent in the history of the event.</p>
