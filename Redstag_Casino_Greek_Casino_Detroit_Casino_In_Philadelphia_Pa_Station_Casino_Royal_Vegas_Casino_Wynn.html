    <h1>Redstag Casino Greek Casino Detroit Casino In Philadelphia Pa Station Casino Royal Vegas Casino Wynn</h1>

<p>WynnBET is determined to grab as much of the sports gambling as it can as quickly as it can. With potentially billions of dollars on the table, Wynn Resorts’ sports gambling and iGaming operator wants a significant percentage. It already has a number of key deals lined up and just inked another one this week. A press release from the company yesterday revealed that it has signed on with the Colorado Rockies of MLB to become a sports betting partner for the team.</p>
<p>WynnBET Extends Reach Into Colorado</p>
<p>WynnBET now has a multi-year deal with the Rockies to go along with its multi-year deal with another MLB team, the Cincinnati Reds. Going forward, Rockies fans visiting Coors Field will see the sportsbook’s name on signage, as well as “app-activation assistance” in the concourses. The WynnBET app will offer prizes and giveaways from time to time, including tickets to games and trips to Wynn Las Vegas. The Rockies also have sports gambling partnership arrangements with DraftKings and BetFred.</p>
<p>In addition to its foray into MLB partnerships, WynnBET is connected to teams in other sports, as well. It is tied to the NBA’s Detroit Pistons and the Memphis Grizzlies, as well as NASCAR, and, as the NFL season approaches, deals with NFL teams can be expected to emerge. Wynn Las Vegas will play a part in WynnBET’s success, with a new sports podcasting studio coming to the property. As of the last update, the studio should be ready to launch by the time NFL rolls around in September.</p>
<p>WynnBET is already live in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Tennessee and Virginia. It just signed an agreement with the San Carlos Apache Tribe that will give it access to the Arizona market, with other territories to be added soon. The sportsbook joined the frenzy later than many others, but has been working hard to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>Colorado’s a Smart Market for Sportsbooks</p>
<p>Colorado has had decent success with its sports gambling. It’s been just over a year since sportsbooks were first able to legally collect wagers and, across the first 12 months, Colorado’s sports gambling handle was $2.3 billion. That resulted in gross revenue of $147.4 million and $6.6 million in taxes paid to the state – money Colorado didn’t have before. Adding license fees and other payments, Colorado has benefited nicely from the introduction of legal sports gambling. Pennsylvania, which has a little more time under its belt, saw a handle last year of $3.5 billion, resulting in $81 million going to the state. That was almost three times the amount from the year before, and Colorado can expect much of the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the Rockies, who are “incredibly excited to join forces” with WynnBET, the NFL’s Denver Broncos are tied to BetFred, BetMGM and FanDuel. The Colorado Avalanche of the NHL and the Denver Nuggets of the NBA have teamed up with a sportsbook, as well, with the Ann Walton Kroenke-owned teams signing PointsBet as their partner. Kroenke’s husband, Stan, is the majority owner and CEO of the NFL’s LA Rams and several other domestic and foreign teams, so additional sportsbook partnerships are likely on the way to the family.</p>
