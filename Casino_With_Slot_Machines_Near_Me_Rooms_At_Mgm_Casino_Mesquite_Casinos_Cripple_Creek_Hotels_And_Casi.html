<p>Hello Tobi1220sl and Guru mods,</p>
<p>thank you Tobias for contacting us.</p>
<p>On the 6th of February you deposited 300€ and claimed the Third Deposit Bonus for 100% Wager free bonus on top of your deposit.</p>
<p>For the sake of the facts I want to mention that your withdrawal request was reviewed by the finance department, and you were properly informed via email the day after requesting the withdrawal. The withdrawal feedback email from finance was delivered and seen by you the same day on the 7th of February. I can't speak about any correspondence outside the casino official because I'm unaware who you spoke to and who provided that information 2 months later. Either way it was needless because you were already informed by the relevant department at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Regarding your gameplay, you started by playing various slots on which you accumulated 3,300€ bonus balance. Then you requested 2k and continued playing eventually entering First Person Mega Ball by Evolution, where you placed several bets of 40€ and 80€ while still being under the Bonus Terms and Conditions. You can access the game log from Mega Ball and verify this by yourself from your account gaming history. If Casino Guru mods request the gamelog we can provide it privately. I also requested the logs from his slots gameplay to verify the legitimacy, for older gameplay we need to request it from the game provider and that can take a bit of time. Hope they provide them in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Our finance department acted upon the Bonus Terms and Conditions, specifically section 7 from the Welcome Package Bonus Terms. You placed bets higher than the 4$/€ max bet and they had to decline your withdrawal request in accordance. Bonuses usually come with Terms and Conditions, not just in our casino but everywhere. I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with them before claiming any bonus.</p>
<p>At the same time I am sorry you had to find out about it this way, it is never pleasant to have winnings retracted but we must guide ourselves according to the rules which we, and the players must abide to.</p>
<p>Remaining available for everything you may need.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Danielle</p>
