<p>In his State of the State Address, Governor Ned Lamont revealed that he is already working with neighboring states and tribal partners to “modernize gaming” in Connecticut. Besides the legalization of sports betting, Connecticut may also push forward the legalization of marijuana this year.</p>
<p>Will Connecticut Legalize Sports Betting and Marijuana in 2021?</p>
<p>It looks like Connecticut may be getting closer to legalizing sports betting and online gambling this year. The news came on Wednesday after Governor Ned Lamont released its State of the State Address. The Governor revealed that he is working with the neighboring states and “working with our tribal partners on a path forward to modernize gaming” and legalizing marijuana in Connecticut.</p>
<p>To enable the legalization of sports betting, the state legislature would need to collaborate with the Tribal leaders. This is because currently, gaming in the state is illegal except for two casinos. Those are Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard which is operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, operated by the Mohegan Tribe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Governor Lamont acknowledged that sports betting, internet gaming, and legalized marijuana is already available in the neighboring states. Another point which the Governor stressed is that those opportunities must not be surrendered “to out-of-state markets or even worse, underground markets“.</p>
<p>“Sports betting, internet gaming, and legalized marijuana are happening all around us.” Governor Ned Lamont</p>
<p>Governor Lamont stressed that resetting of the relationships with the neighboring and regional states is important. He outlined that this was one of the things which he improved at a time when the “federal government failed to come up with a national strategy” in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In his message, the Governor expressed his gratitude to all doctors, nurses, teachers, and other essential workers who have been on the front line against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Focusing on nearby New York, back in December, Senator Joe Addabbo called for the legalization of mobile betting. With that in mind, both states would undoubtedly benefit by filling some budget holes created by the pandemic with fresh tax revenue if sports betting and online gambling are legalized.</p>
