<p>NuxGame and Sumsub have entered into a new strategic partnership that will see the former benefit from the KYC and AML specialist’s solutions designed to protect business integrity within the gambling industry. NuxGame delivers betting and gaming software that will be enhanced by Sumsub’s own offer which focuses on ensuring that KYC and AML standards are met.</p>
<p>Compliance Crucial for iGaming Business Long-Term Success</p>
<p>To this end, NuxGame’s network of operators will have access to Sumsub’s security and compliance services which have been known to deliver the desired quality and industry standard. Sumsub offers an all-in-one identity verification platform that facilitates player onboarding and ensures that businesses steer clear of fraud or other regulatory shortcomings.</p>
<p>NuxGame is also interested in rapidly expanding its reach and to achieve this, it needs to build on a robust integrity solution, the type that Sumsub can provide. NuxGame also entered into a collaboration with Optimove, which specializes in marketing solutions that focus exclusively on customer preferences, and PartnerMatrix, a leading affiliate company and management system. NuxGame also has a partnership with Platipus Gaming.</p>
<p>NuxGame head of sales Bar Konson commented on this fresh opportunity, stressing the importance of compliance in the iGaming industry and why it plays such a crucial role in ensuring that businesses remain competitive and move forward. He explained:</p>
<p>Security and compliance have always been hot topics in iGaming, but never more so than now, with the rising demand and interest in blockchain technology driving industry standards and customer expectations considerably.</p>
<p>He also explained that Sumsub had a proven track record in delivering compliant and efficient solutions that made it simpler for consumers to onboard and have an enjoyable experience on NuxGame’s partner platforms. Not least, Konson argued that the months ahead will lead to a fruitful experience for both companies.</p>
<p>Sumsub Confident about Work with NuxGame</p>
<p>Sumsub chief strategy officer Peter Sever also welcomed the opportunity and commended NuxGame for what it brought to the table and to iGaming as a whole. Sever outlined Sumsub’s own ambitions in the industry and said: “We aim to develop the most advanced security and compliance products for the iGaming industry that earn the trust of leading players. By partnering with an established provider like NuxGame, we stay true to this mission.”</p>
<p>Sumsub previously released a detailed guide on KYC standards for the European gambling industry, imparting a lot of great knowledge and a deeper understanding of what operators need to be doing to move forward.</p>
