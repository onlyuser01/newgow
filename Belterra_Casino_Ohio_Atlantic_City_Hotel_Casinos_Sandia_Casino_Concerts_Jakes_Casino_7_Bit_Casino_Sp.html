<p>Hey, Thanks for the answer. I sent the information to you. So the situation was that I wanted to exclude myself from this casino due to gambling addiction. I sent them an email asking them to close my account as soon as possible. (as shown in the email they temporarily closed my account) Unfortunately I had a pending withdrawal request. I tried to find information on their website, can I get my withdrawal if my account is closed. I couldn't find this information anywhere. I panicked. So I wanted my winnings out and told them I accidentally sent the email to the wrong address. I find it strange that there is no mention anywhere that you can get the funds in the account even if the account is closed. They knew I had a pending request. So it couldn't be that I was unhappy with the games. I just wanted a break from playing because I knew my problem.Unfortunately, I didn't dare to tell about my gambling addiction because I was afraid that I would lose my winnings from this casino.I understood from their terms that the account remains closed for a minimum of one week.</p>
<p>I have been banned from all n1 interactive ltd casinos due to gambling addiction. One of the ltd casinos is casiqo and wildfortune, which are subsidiaries of spin samurai. Still, I have free access to casiqo and wildfortune casinos. I do not understand why. They don't respect my problem even though they know about it. It's not responsible. So I demanded 3500 euros back, which I lost after I requested the closure of my game Account. Because spin samurai is a subsidiary of casiqo and wildfortune. They should have been aware of my addiction.I also sent you proof that I am locked out of the casinos under the n1 interactive license. This is confirmed by bob casino.</p>
