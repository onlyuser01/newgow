    <h1>Poseidon Casino Vegas Payday Casino Captainjack Casino Buffalo Thunder Resort And Casino San Juan Ma</h1>

<p>Dear Mike3051,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please understand, that the Dutch license is necessary only for those casinos which want to operate in the Dutch market (targeting the Netherlands).</p>
<p>It is the same principle as if you enter the casino from a restricted country. We accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to emphasize, that we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds (or winnings) have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem that this is the case here (but correct me if I am wrong, please).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this case, we are not able to help you and you have no right for a refund of your deposits. I can only recommend you to do better research next time and play only in the casinos licensed in the Netherlands. Please let me know, if there is anything else, I could do for you regarding this case, otherwise, I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
