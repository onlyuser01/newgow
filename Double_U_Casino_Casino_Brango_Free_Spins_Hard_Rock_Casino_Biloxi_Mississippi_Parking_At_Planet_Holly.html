<p>The Dog House Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This is a slot for the dog lovers out there.</p>
<p>The Dog House Megaways is themed around a collection of dogs living in an idealised suburban neighbourhood. The collection of mutts live in adjacent gardens, dig for bones, and if you get them all together in the right place, they reward you with coins as well as tail wagging.</p>
<p>The cartoonish style makes the little barkers seem cheery and welcoming.</p>
<p>Big win in The Dog House Megaways slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are very cute. The variety and styles of dogs are varied and interesting. Each of them has been given a personality by the artist that shines through.</p>
<p>The animations add greatly to the experience. Each symbol is animated with a short loop that is triggered whenever the symbol is part of a win.</p>
<p>The music is a little annoying after a short while, as are the ambient sounds of dogs barking. But the win and spin sounds are effective. And the sound menu lets you turn off the music if it starts to get offensive.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The Dog House Megaways uses the Megaways system. This is a licenseable system that developers can reskin for their slots. Megaways games are any way wins, meaning that winning combinations are made by matching symbols appearing in the reels from left to right, starting in reel one.</p>
<p>Each of the six reels has a random number of symbols on it. The number of symbols will always be picked from two to seven inclusive. This means that the number of ways to win varies from spin to spin, but the maximum is 117,649.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol and comes with a randomised multiplier between x1 and x3. If multiple Wilds are part of a winning combination, the multipliers are combined (i.e. if there are two x3 multipliers a winning combo, the final multiplier is x9).</p>
<p>Three or more Scatters anywhere on the reels will trigger the Free Spin Bonus.</p>
<p>Player has two choices when Free Spins feature is triggered</p>
<p>Players can choose from between two free spin bonuses: Sticky Wild Free Spins and Raining Wild Free spins. In Sticky Wild Free Spins, any Wild symbol that lands remains on the reels until the final spin. As the reels change size, so does the Wild symbol.</p>
<p>In Raining Wilds Free Spins, up to six Wilds appear on every single spin.</p>
<p>Players can also buy directly into the Free Spins Bonus for 100 times their bet per spin.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.55%, comfortably over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Full paytable for The Dog House Megaways slot</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility. When combined with the RTP of 96.55%, this slot becomes especially appealing.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With an RTP of 96.55% and high volatility, we like this slot for use with our preferred slot strategies.</p>
<p>However, statistics alone aren’t all there is to a slot. So, it helps that this slot is filled to the brim with personality. The animations and graphics are lovely, and once you turn the music off, the sound effects are fun and appropriate.</p>
<p>Fans of Megaways slots will know exactly what they are getting with this slot, but that familiarity of gameplay isn’t a problem per se.</p>
<p>We recommend this slot.</p>
