    <h1>Downtown Grand Hotel Casino Harrah Casino Cherokee Nc Delaware Park Casino Point Casino Baltimore Ca</h1>

<p>The launch complements the gambling startup's plan for further expansion in the US and marks the second state where the company's real money gaming product is live</p>
<p>The first micro betting-focused app, founded by Jake Paul and sports betting veteran, Joey Levy, Betr, continues to expand the reach of its real money product. The company unveiled Thursday that its real-money product has officially launched in a second US state – Massachusetts. To celebrate the launch of its product, Betr organized a special launch party, while at the same time vowed to schedule activations at sports events, bars and other locations in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>Thanks to the launch, eligible customers in Massachusetts can download Betr’s micro-betting app which is available via Android and iOS stores. Although this is the second state where Betr launched its real money gaming product, the company revealed that it anticipates continuing to expand its presence and enter new states soon.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch of its real money gaming product, Betr confirmed the soft launch of its Scripts product, a unique “first-of-its-kind experience and effectively introduces instant gratification to parlays.” The solution that combines long odds of a parlay with a micro bet is expected to deliver instant gratification for the bettors and at the same time elevate their experience.</p>
<p>The Company Is Delighted to Launch Its Product in Massachusetts</p>
<p>Joey Levy, Betr’s CEO, said that the company is delighted to expand the reach of its product to Massachusetts. Moreover, he explained that the state has some of the most dedicated and passionate sports fans, as well as popular sports franchises.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to launch Betr Betting in Massachusetts, home of some of the world’s greatest sports franchises and fans.“ Joey Levy, CEO at Betr</p>
<p>Betr’s CEO added: “We will be just the 7th operator to enter the state, only trailing FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars, WynnBet, and Barstool to market.” Levy acknowledged that this marks a significant achievement considering the company’s launch was not even a year ago and it had limited resources. Finally, the CEO of the gambling startup thanked the gambling regulator in the state that greenlighted the launch of the company’s product.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank the Massachusetts Gaming Commission for their partnership and we are excited to introduce Betr to the Commonwealth’s top notch sports ecosystem,“ added Levy</p>
<p>The entry in Massachusetts marks another step in Betr’s plan for expansion this year. Back in January, Ohio was the first state where the company launched its product. Following the launch, Betr estimated that it has organically converted some 20% of its media audience to its real money gambling product.</p>
