    <h1>Casino Pictures Silver Sevens Casino Real Online Casinos Win A Day Casino Starfield Casino Location</h1>

<p>I had been playing on this site for some time and had made some deposits. All the gambling had been done from Denmark on the games that were available in Denmark.</p>
<p>The problem I am facing is that I had accidentally been on the site whilst I was on a vpn. I regularly use the vpn for browsing and watching Netflix. No bets were placed and no money was spent while the vpn was on. As soon as I realised the vpn was on I logged out.</p>
<p>I tried to explain to the casino that no bets were placed and no funds were used as this was a mistake, but the casino did not understand my mistake.</p>
<p>i have told them that I can accept that my account will be closed after I get my winnings.</p>
<p>accidentally being on the site while the vpn did not result in any bets place or any funds used while the vpn was on by accident.</p>
<p>I have tried to explain this but they do not seem to understand.</p>
<p>please help me with this case as I does not seem fair.</p>
