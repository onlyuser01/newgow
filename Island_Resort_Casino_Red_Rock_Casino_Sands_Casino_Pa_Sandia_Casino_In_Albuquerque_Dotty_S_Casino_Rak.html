<p>Raketech, Malta-based online affiliate, and content market provider, has proposed Ulrik Bengtsson, William Hill chief executive, to become its new chairman.</p>
<p>Ulrik Bengtsson Could Become the New Chairman of Raketech</p>
<p>After Christian Lundberg declined to be re-elected, Raketech proposed William Hill’s Ulrik Bengtsson to become its new chairman. Bengtsson joined William Hill in April 2018 as its chief digital officer and became its CEO in September 2019.</p>
<p>Before that, he was president, chairman, and chief executive of Betsson Group, a Swedish gambling company. Bengtsson was the CEO of Modern Times Group, a digital entertainment company based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>If Bengtsson becomes a chairman, approved by the Raketech committee, he will be officially appointed on May 17, during the provider’s annual general meeting.</p>
<p>Raketech nomination committee chairman Tobias Persson Rosenqvist said that with his profound knowledge, first-hand experience, and connections in iGaming, Bengtsson would be perfect for the position to accelerate the provider’s growth.</p>
<p>Raketech Has Great Management and Clear Strategy</p>
<p>Rosenqvist also said his gratitude to Lundberg for his hard work from 2017 to now and for “creating a well-balanced mix between entrepreneurial creativity and well-functioning governance and structure.”</p>
<p>Lundberg stated that when he was appointed he had a mission to create a structure and ensure Raketech’s ability to operate in a listed environment, on Stockholm Nasdaq First North. He stated that he is proud to see Raketech stable and listed with good management and clear strategy. Lundberg said: “My mission is thereby done, and it is time for me to hand over to someone else who can take Raketech to the next level.”</p>
<p>Other nominees proposed for by the Raketech nomination committee include the newly appointed Magnus Gottås, the re-election of Fredrik Svederman, Annika Billberg, Johan Svensson, and Erik Skarp. During the general meeting next month the complete proposal will be presented.</p>
<p>Raketech’s Strategic Acquisitions in 2020 Boosted Its Growth</p>
<p>In 2020 Raketech made some strategic moves and acquired US-facing affiliate site American Gambler and Canada and Germany-facing performance marketing company Lead Republik.</p>
<p>Through the deal with American Gambler, Raketech took ownership of local state assets and accelerated its growth even more. With this acquisition, the provider received revenue from the US between 5% and 10% for 2020.</p>
<p>The affiliate acquired the data-driven network Lead Republik for €1.4 million. Although registered in Malta, Lead Republik drew its revenue primarily from Canada, Germany, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>With these strategic acquisitions, Raketech registered a 23% increase in revenue for 2020.</p>
