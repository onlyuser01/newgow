<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) released a warning on its website aimed at all those who intend to complement watching Super Bowl LVI with placing bets.</p>
<p>Warning in the Midst of the Hype</p>
<p>The NCPG as an organization that is neither for nor against legalized gambling expressed its concerns ahead of the Big Game this Sunday. According to estimates, the Super Bowl will see wagers totaling $1 billion more than a year before as around 31 million people plan to bet on the event.</p>
<p>Super Bowl LVI is taking place at a time of rapid expansion of sports betting legalization across the US. Thirty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are now offering some form of legal sports wagering and NCPG executive director Keith Whyte felt compelled to address the public ahead of the game.</p>
<p>“The trends we are seeing around sports gambling and problematic play are very concerning. Too many people still don’t recognize they are exhibiting signs of this addictive behavior and are unaware of the help that is available to them.” Keith Whyte, Executive Director, NCPG</p>
<p>According to the findings of the second National Survey on Gambling Attitudes and Gambling Experiences (NGAGE 2.0) that was created by the NCPG back in 2018, problem gambling in the period 2018-2021 was prevalent with two particular at-risk groups: sports bettors, including those who play fantasy sports, and gamblers aged between 18 and 44.</p>
<p>More worryingly, the survey showed 220 million adult Americans have no idea if they experience signs of problematic gambling where to get help from.</p>
<p>“Every organization that provides gambling opportunities has a responsibility to develop policies and programs to promote responsible gambling and address problem gambling.” Keith Whyte, Executive Director, NCPG</p>
<p>Tips to Avoid Problem Gambling</p>
<p>The NCPG outlined that while the hype is ramping up and sportsbooks are advertising their betting lines for Super Bowl LVI, it is offering tips for those who gamble how to do that in a safe and responsible manner to minimize risk, as well as provide help for people already impacted by problem gambling.</p>
<p>The council stressed the importance of having a plan in place before starting to wager, whether you are a novice or have been gambling for years, pointing to the tips provided by the ResponsiblePlay.org website.</p>
<p>Finally, the NCPG provided a broader definition of problem gambling and its symptoms to help people who do not know they experience it realize that they may need help.</p>
<p>“Problem gambling, or gambling addiction, includes all gambling behavior patterns that compromise, disrupt or damage personal, family or vocational pursuits,” the NCPG stated, outlining “increasing preoccupation with gambling, a need to bet more money more frequently, restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop, “chasing” losses, and loss of control manifested by the continuation of gambling behavior despite negative consequences” as symptoms of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Noting that in extreme cases, excessive gambling behavior could lead to “financial ruin, legal problems, loss of career and family, or even suicide,” the NCPG advised anyone who recognizes the signs to seek help on the National Problem Gambling Helpline that is available 24/7 and 100% confidential.</p>
