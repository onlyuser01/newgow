<p>Three of the suspects are on the lam. Two suspects were identified as Dante Braxton, 24, and Jamile Rivera, 29, both of Atlantic City. Each is wanted for aggravated assault, possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, Atlantic City police announced in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Kamal Allen, 34, of Bridgeton, New Jersey, is being sought for two counts of aggravated assault, possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, police said. Akbar Pearson, 33, of Camden, New Jersey, was also charged already with aggravated assault, the statement added.</p>
<p>Pearson and two other victims were stabbed or slashed during the fight. When police arrived, the violence occurred at the casino’s valet area.</p>
<p>The victims were initially treated at the casino following the 1:31 am fight. They were transported to New Jersey’s AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center, City Campus. The victims are expected to recover.</p>
<p>Video of the fight was posted on social media sites.</p>

<p>Allen Worked in Violence Prevention</p>
<p>It was later revealed that Allen is an anti-violence task force worker from Atlantic City, BreakingAC.com, a local news site, reported. He is likely to be fired from his city post.</p>
<p>We’re aware of the incidents and the charges, and we’ve taken the position to terminate his employment, and we will move on as a unit,” Mayor Marty Small told BreakingAC.com.</p>
<p>“We gave him the opportunity, but as with any city employee who violates the terms of their employment, we have to make a decision,” Small added. “Our prayers go out to all who have been affected.”</p>
<p>Prior Violence</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident in September, a Philadelphia man was arrested for a fatal stabbing of another man at Atlantic City’s Ocean Casino Resort. The violent attack took place in a hotel room.</p>
<p>The suspect was identified as Andrew James Osborne, 34. As of several weeks ago, he was in Pennsylvania awaiting extradition to face charges in New Jersey. He’s facing counts of murder and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>
<p>The victim was identified as Brian Wilkinson, 47, of Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. He was pronounced dead in the room at the Boardwalk casino hotel, according to a statement released by Atlantic County Prosecutor William “Will” Reynolds.</p>
<p>An autopsy was performed by the Southern Regional Medical Examiner’s Office. The cause of death was stab wounds, which was ruled a homicide.</p>
<p>Last December, another violent brawl also occurred at Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City. A victim was treated at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center. Several participants in the struggle were thrown to the floor and punched. One assailant used a chair to injure another person.</p>
