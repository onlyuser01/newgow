    <h1>Excalibur Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Flowing Water Casino Casino In Ohio Sunset Station Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Sycknick86,</p>
<p>What do you mean by "investment account", please? Are we talking about a personal account? Does this account belong to you, so it is possible to verify that it is in your name? Are you please aware that players are obliged to use only payment methods in their names, and using a 3rd party payment method (or any business payment method) breaches the casino's Terms and Conditions?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although your screenshots contain information about the account number, I cannot see any information about the owner of the account there, and the date format is not clear. Do I understand correctly that it shows transactions/statements from the 6th of August 2023 until the 6th of November 2023? Is it please possible to generate a normal and classic bank statement showing your personal details, and account number for the period requested by the casino? Feel free to post it here or send it to my email (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
<p>I am afraid the provided screenshots do not meet common and standard conditions in order for the casino could consider it sufficient as a bank statement from your payment method.</p>
<p>In addition, you claimed that you made a deposit to the casino. When was this deposit made? From the screenshots provided by the casino above, I can see only $50,00 that was left in your account upon requesting the first withdrawal. Is that the deposit that you allegedly made to the casino? Did you make any real money deposits to the casino at all? If yes, when exactly and in what amount?</p>
<p>What should the screenshots of the bank statement from Lloyds Bank show to us? Should it be a confirmation that the $130 was successfully paid out? Can you please confirm you received the $130?</p>
<p>Dear Black Lotus Casino team,</p>
<p>Thank you for the additional information and clarification.</p>
<p>However, there are still questions that have not been answered completely yet, and a few more questions that arose.</p>
<p>Can you please send me the following:</p>
<p>The complete and detailed player game logs showing transactions (deposits/withdrawals) and bonuses</p>
<p>The user's transaction history and history of the bonuses used if they are not visible in his game logs</p>
<p>The information on what particular bonus was used to accumulate the disputed winnings and where can I find its specific rules if there are any + what exact rules were breached or applied by the casino</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, the casino paid out $150 ($130 after deducting a fee) to the player's payment method. What exactly do you need from the player to prove that the payment was not credited to his payment method? Can you please provide us with the payment method details to which the payment was sent?</p>
<p>You mentioned that "They made a withdrawal from the same winnings won from the $20 referral bonus." But, in the provided screenshots, I can see only 1 withdrawal request and $50 that was left in the player's account upon this withdrawal request. So, I think that the main issue is that the player continued playing with the winnings left in his balance upon making the withdrawal, right?</p>
<p>Were the wagering requirements and other conditions for the bonus in question completely met upon making this withdrawal? If not, what exactly was not met or what was breached?</p>
<p>If yes, and the player was entitled to withdraw the $150, why did the casino allow him to leave $50 from these winnings in his balance to continue playing? Did he see all those winnings as a withdrawable balance? Is there any rule stating that players have to request a withdrawal of the entire balance and that continuing playing means everything over the maximum cashout will be voided? Or, are players informed about it in another way?</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly that it would have been alright if the player requested a withdrawal of the entire balance (withdrawing the $150 - $130 after deducting a fee), and then deposited it back to continue playing?</p>
<p>If the bonus wagering requirements and conditions were completely met, should not it mean that he should have received $100 (deducting a fee) to his payment method from the withdrawal, while the $50 left in his account should be considered real money and not bonus money anymore ($150 together), without applying the bonus rules to these funds?</p>
<p>Feel free to use my email to share the necessary data and details (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
