<p>Relax Gaming, a leading iGaming aggregator and content developer, has signed a new content partnership with MegApuestas, breaking ground in the Colombian iGaming market, making it the first instance when the company has been able to launch its products in the country and Latin American region as a whole.</p>
<p>MegApuestas Welcomes Relax Gaming’s Proprietary Content</p>
<p>Thanks to the link-up, Relax Gaming will offer MegApuestas players access to award-winning games and an impressive portfolio of curated games. MegApuestas will benefit from a number of Relax Gaming’s established games, including Temple Tumble, Banana Town, Money Train 2, and more.</p>
<p>This marks an important milestone for the award-winning developer of iGaming content as it allows it to expand into a new geographical region backed by a trusted and respected local partner. The South American geographies open up countless opportunities for Relax’s aggregation and proprietary gaming solutions and Colombia in particular has been experiencing rapid growth in the iGaming vertical.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming will be able to use this market entry as a springboard to power its future launches in Latin America and well beyond as interest in regulating iGaming increases.</p>
<p>More partner operators are expected to be announced by Relax Gaming in the future. Commenting on this opportunity, company chief regulatory officer Alexia Smilovic Rønde welcomed the Colombian entry and said that the company was delighted to enter the Latin American region for the first time, noting that it coincided with Relax Gaming’s ambitions:</p>
<p>The high pace at which we’re expanding globally is deeply encouraging, especially with this new jurisdiction that boasts such a high regulatory profile. Relax Gaming chief regulatory officer Alexia Smilovic Rønde</p>
<p>To make this launch a success, Rønde said that the company used its experience with launching in other markets, making it easier for the company to navigate the important development in Latin America. Rønde confirmed that the company will remain vigilant and up-to-date with local regulations as it seeks to navigate and understand the region and future commercial opportunities better.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming Confident about Future of LatAm Growth</p>
<p>Relax CCO Nadiya Attard welcomed the partnership and its significance for the company. Colombia is a strategically important market as it was also one of the first to regulate its iGaming offer in the region and become a role model.</p>
<p>“We look forward to launching our proprietary content within Colombia with leading titles, and the business growth to come,” Attard said in a press statement, confident in the future potential of the market and Relax’s a place in it.</p>
<p>MegApuesta head of CRM Daniela Asaftei also welcomes the opportunity to introduce Relax Gaming content to local players. Asaftei said that the company will provide local players with a new level of entertainment and that MegApuesta is looking forward to seeing how these products are welcomed by local players.</p>
