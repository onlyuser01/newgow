<p>Online casino and sports betting company Affinity Interactive announced it has promoted Andrei Scrivens to the role of Chief Executive Officer. Scrivens, who has been serving as Chief Financial Officer since 2019, will step into his new role on January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Climbing to the Top of the Ladder</p>
<p>Scrivens is set to succeed Mary Beth Higgins who is calling an end to an illustrious 25-year career in gaming and is retiring but will remain in an advisory role for another six months to ensure a smooth transition of the responsibilities.</p>
<p>Scrivens has more than a decade of experience in the gaming and hospitality sector and was a key figure in the formation of Affinity Interactive through the merger of Affinity Gaming and Sports Information Group in 2021.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new appointment, James Zenni Jr., chairman of Affinity Interactive, outlined the instrumental role Scrivens has played in helping the company establish itself as an industry-leading platform, confident that his vision will continue to lead the business to even greater success.</p>
<p>He then switched his focus on Scrivens’ gaming industry experience, seeing it as an invaluable asset as Affinity Interactive is looking to “capitalize on the growing demand for omni-channel casino and online gaming products.”</p>
<p>“I look forward to continuing to partner together as we further enhance our best-in-class gaming offerings and products for customers and guests,” Zenni Jr. added before expressing his thanks to Higgins for her “leadership, dedication and countless contributions” to the success of the company, and wishing her well in her retirement.</p>
<p>Newly-promoted Scrivens hailed the incredible opportunity to take the wheel of the business during an exciting phase of its growth, paying tribute to the exceptional talent across the organization, as well as the commitment to the business objectives.</p>
<p>‘I am excited to work closely with ZCG and lead a world-class team as we expand our footprint across physical casino locations, online gaming platforms and digital media,” he said, expressing his gratitude to Higgins for her “leadership over the past few years,” and “looking forward to building on the strong foundation” that is already in place.</p>
<p>Scrivens, who also served as a Managing Director at Z Capital Partners (ZCG) for seven years before joining Affinity Interactive, was a Director at middle market private equity firm and boutique bank Chilmark Partners prior to joining ZCG.</p>
<p>“Leading AI has been a privilege and an incredible journey,” said Higgins, proud of all the achievements of the business and convinced that the time is right for the company “to transition to its next generation of leadership,” and confident that Scrivens is more than capable of answering to the demands of the role and executing “on the exciting developments” ahead.</p>
