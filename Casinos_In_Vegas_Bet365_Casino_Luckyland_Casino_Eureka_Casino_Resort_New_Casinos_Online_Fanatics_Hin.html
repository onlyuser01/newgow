    <h1>Casinos In Vegas Bet365 Casino Luckyland Casino Eureka Casino Resort New Casinos Online Fanatics Hin</h1>

<p>In November, residents of West Virginia gained access to Fanatics’ online casino. This marked the debut of the brand for the online casino vertical and its existing PointsBet users were given instructions on how to access their account with the operator. The launch was achieved after last year, Fanatics agreed to acquire PointsBet’s US-facing assets.</p>
<p>Now, as announced by Play Pennsylvania, Fanatics continues its online casino expansion with a planned launch in Pennsylvania for next week. Users who had PointsBet accounts were informed earlier this week by Fanatics that their accounts would be transitioned to Fanatics sportsbook and casino next week.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fanatics explained that users will receive further instructions in due time and are not required to do anything currently. Similar to other transitions for the sector, the company explained that the user’s information, including Rewards Points, Bonus Bets and outstanding balance will be automatically transferred to Fanatics sportsbook and casino.</p>
<p>Still, the operator explained that the Free Spins belonging to users with PointsBet Casino accounts are not going to be transferred to the new platform. Fanatics vowed to disclose additional details about the upcoming launch soon.</p>
<p>“PointsBet is becoming Fanatics Sportsbook and Casino, and your account is moving with you next week,“ reads an email sent to PointsBet users</p>
<p>Customers of the Operator Can Earn FanCash</p>
<p>Just like other betting and iGaming operators, Fanatics offers a loyalty program. The operator’s system allows punters who participate in online gambling and wager on sports to earn FanCash. This form of loyalty currency can then be exchanged for bonus wagers or can be used by sports fans to purchase sportswear of their favorite team.</p>
<p>Fanatics tapped into the established customer base of PointsBet by acquiring its US-facing assets in a deal for $225 million dating back to last year. While the company initially proposed $150 million for those assets, betting industry rival DraftKings made a $195 million proposal. This prompted Fanatics to upgrade its initial offer to $225 million, which was ultimately the cost of the acquisition.</p>
