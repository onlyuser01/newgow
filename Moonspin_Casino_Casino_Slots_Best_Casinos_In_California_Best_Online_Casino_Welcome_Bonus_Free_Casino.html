<p>Buffalo Bills Going for a Win in Florida</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 10-6 overall with four wins in a row. They defeated a couple of real heavyweights lately, most notably, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Dallas Cowboys. Now, they need to do the same against the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Dolphins probably won’t be too motivated as they’ve already done their job. The bad news is that Sunday’s game is played at Hard Rock Stadium where the Dolphins have been pretty good this season. Further, the Bills aren’t famous for being a team that does spectacularly well on the road.</p>
<p>In fact, their away record is 3-4 this season, but on the bright side, two of those three wins happened in their last two away games.</p>
<p>Will Miami Dolphins Take It Easy in Week 18?</p>
<p>The Dolphins are 11-5 on the season, with their most recent game seeing them get destroyed by the Baltimore Ravens in a battle for the No. 1 seed in the American Football Conference (AFC). The final score was 56-19 for the Ravens.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens gave the Miami Dolphins a taste of their own medicine and they didn’t like it too much.</p>

<p>They’re now second in the conference rankings, but if they lost on Sunday, they could drop down a few spots. Still, one thing is certain – whatever happens in Week 18, they will play in the playoffs.</p>
<p>This is why we might see them take it easy on Sunday. After all, coach Mike McDaniel probably wants to keep his key men 100% healthy for the postseason. On the other hand, he also wants them to enter the playoffs with high confidence, which is why bouncing back onto the winning track would be an ideal scenario.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Prediction</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins usually do not do great against big teams. In fact, the Dallas Cowboys are the only team that was over .500 when they beat them. This is definitely good news for the Bills who are known to produce great performances when needed.</p>
<p>On top of everything, they’ve got a very good record against their AFC East rivals, having won each of the last three duels with the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills</p>
