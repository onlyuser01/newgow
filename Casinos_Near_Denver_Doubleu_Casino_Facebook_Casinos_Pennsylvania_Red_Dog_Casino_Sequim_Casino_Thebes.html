<p>Hello Noily.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint through our website. We are very sorry that your winnings were cancelled. Unfortunately, in this case, we can’t help you. In casino’s T&amp;Cs it is clearly stated that you can take free spins only once and win a maximum of $100. In case that you take free spins again, all winnings are non-cashable.</p>
<p>From the casino’s T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>1.1.7. Only the first free spins/free bonus applied on the player's account are part of the Sign-up offer. Any subsequent free spins or free bonuses received before making the first deposit are not considered withdrawable and winnings will be voided.</p>
<p>The Casino offers free spins for players to try the games, and if they like them, they can deposit and play for real. In case that you make a deposit, you can take promotional free spins. You need to deposit between taking any two bonuses.</p>
<p>Each casino has a different bonus strategy. But all casinos have the same rule which says that bonuses are for recreational play only. Bonuses should extend the players experience or allow them to see how casino looks like and help them to decide if they want to play in this casino. Taking a number of free bonuses in a row is considered as bonus abuse in every casino. We agree that the casino should mention the rule 1.1.7 in each promotional e-mail and we will suggest this idea to them.</p>
<p>We understand that not everybody reads the terms and conditions. We hope that in the future all bonus terms would be enforced by the system and players would be not able to unknowingly beach terms such as max bet. Unfortunately, now players are responsible for reading the T&amp;Cs and following them. We are sorry but based on what you wrote to us, we have no other option than reject to your complaint.</p>
<p>Regards, Matej</p>
