    <h1>Fortune Casino Waterloo Casino San Tan Mountain Casino Big Candy Casino Casino Shreveport La All Rig</h1>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I received an offer from AllRight Casino by email and phone almost every day, and for the first time today I made a deposit of $ 20 in the free spins offer.</p>
<p>The deposit method is ecopayz.</p>
<p>The free spins victory money was discarded because there are few games that can be used when holding it.</p>
<p>The problem is from here.</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal is made after the cash betting conditions are exhausted, looking at the cashier, the only withdrawal choice is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So I contacted support "Asuna-san", but he said that only Bitcoin can be withdrawn.</p>
<p>However, even if you make a deposit with ecopayz at the time of deposit, you cannot make a deposit with ecopayz. There is no statement to that effect.</p>
<p>I asked for withdrawal again by ecopayz or bank transfer, but it was rejected.</p>
<p>I'm not convinced at all, so please take action.</p>
