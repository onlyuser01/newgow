<p>OneComply, a platform that provides compliance solutions to betting operators, has secured crucial funding thanks to its latest seed financing round.</p>
<p>OneComply Completed Its Latest Seed Financing Round</p>
<p>The round was led by Warner Investments and attracted additional investments by notable names from the gambling sector. According to OneComply’s announcement, key industry specialists such as Benjie Cherniak, Katie Lever and Quintin Singleton participated in the round.</p>
<p>OneComply opted to not disclose the exact sum it earned publically. However, it announced that it will use the funding to scale its business and enhance its products. OneComply will further boost its solutions that help online and retail gambling companies stay compliant by centralizing and streamlining all data required to help them maintain their license.</p>
<p>Bill Warner from Warner Investments spoke about the importance of OneComply’s mission to help companies stay compliant with the rules of the various markets they operate in. He pointed out that the growth of the US market has attracted countless new companies, making the sector more competitive than ever.</p>
<p>Companies that aspire to be successful have to not only differentiate their offerings from those of their competitors but to do so while avoiding breaching the local regulations. Warner added that this is where OneComply comes in:</p>
<p>“Managing this critical aspect of the business requires advanced, purpose-built solutions that are able to tie together all these disparate parts and break down the silos that can put a license in jeopardy.” Warner Investments Bill Warner</p>
<p>OneComply’s Solutions Are Critical to Companies in the US</p>
<p>Cameron Conn, the co-founder, and chief executive officer of OneComply, spoke about the funding round. He said that the money will greatly help the company and help it to enhance its offerings in the United States.</p>
<p>Conn explained that the US market tends to be tricky and its highly interrelated industry can hold an operator responsible for a regulation breach made by its partner or vendor. He noted that all separate elements of an operator have a compliance component to them and each component needs to be carefully managed and monitored. The CEO reasserted that this is precisely why OneComply’s solutions are so beneficial.</p>
<p>“OneComply has created a centralized portal to tie all these pieces together, giving our customers an easy way to manage all their licensing and compliance, plus providing a complete view of the health of their most important asset – their gaming license.”</p>
<p>OneComply’s solutions have helped numerous companies adhere to the rules of the markets they operate in. The company recently supported FansUnite’s entry into the US market.</p>
