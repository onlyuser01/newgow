    <h1>Hit It Rich Casino Pala Casino 400 Casino Ruidoso 7 Seas Casino World Casinos Open Near Me Wintomato</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>Based on the fact the casino contacted us recently and was able to provide us with all the requested data and details supporting the casino representative’s claims above, we decided to reopen and update the complaint.</p>
<p>Dear 23tomatik23,</p>
<p>After gathering and thorough reviewing of all the necessary information, we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's terms and conditions – there are reasonable grounds to believe that we are talking about the use of multiple accounts by one person, which is strictly prohibited in online casinos, and bonus abuse. Since the data shows that the owner of these accounts tried to avoid the connection of the accounts being discovered by the casino, for understandable reasons, we will not disclose the details and matches found. It would be very difficult to prove anything else. We accept the casino’s decision to confiscate the disputed winnings.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that regulates the casino, if you have not done it yet. In case of any questions or news from the regulator, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Wintomato Casino team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
