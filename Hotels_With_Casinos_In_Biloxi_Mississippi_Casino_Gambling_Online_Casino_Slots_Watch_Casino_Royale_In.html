    <h1>Hotels With Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Casino Gambling Online Casino Slots Watch Casino Royale In</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>I successfully registered at CasinoRocket on 7 March 2023. I also verified my account via e-mail. I successfully deposited 480 euros and finally won 1000 euros without a bonus. I then requested a payout of my balance in the amount of 1000 euros. I received a confirmation email. I then uploaded my passport, proof of address, bank statements, and the screenshot of the Paysafecard transaction in the requested format. On 8 March 2023 at 01.00 at night, I received a message that I had won a prize. I went to the casino's website to see what prize I had won. That's when I noticed that my account was blocked. I then sent four messages via email to support in the next 24 hours because I wanted to know why my account was blocked and if and when I would receive my 1000 EUro. The casino ignores my messages.</p>
<p>I think the casino's rating is too high for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The casino advertises a 24/7 - live chat that does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The casino does not respond to emails. This is particularly serious because you can only request a self-exclusion or a cool-off period via email to the support. Player protection is therefore not guaranteed at all if the casino ignores for days a request from a player who wants to have his account blocked because of gambling addiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The account remains active as long as deposits are made. Shortly after a win, the account is blocked and communication with the player is cut off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I demand an explanation from the casino:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an explanation as to why my account was closed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an explanation and apology why my messages went unanswered for so long. Â¨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the assurance that I will receive my 1000 EURO as soon as possible and without complications (no excuse that a bank supposedly still has to confirm something).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the notification of how much my won prize was, which I could not see because my account was blocked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also demand an authentic apology and not a copy-paste message like "Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience! We'd like to investigate this case and get back to you with the best solution".</p>
