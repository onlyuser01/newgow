<p>TalkBanStop is a pilot launched for 12 months that aims at reducing gambling-related harms. Thanks to combining gambling exclusion tools and trained advisers, the pilot aims to help people who have felt problem gambling.</p>
<p>A New Pilot Campaign Is Making Positive Impact</p>
<p>GamCare, Gamban and GAMSTOP all collaborated to launch TalkBanStop. The innovative pilot offers professional support from trained GamCare advisers. Moreover, it grants users free access to Gamban blocking software, available for multiple devices. Additionally, people participating can register for the free self-exclusion program GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>According to Ipsos Mori, a further important outcome of the layered approach was the positive state of mind it gave people looking to stop gambling,” reads a statement released by GamCare</p>
<p>Now, according to an evaluation by Ipsos Mori, the multi-layer pilot is already making a positive impact and helps people reduce gambling-related harms. Ipsos Mori explained that the “use of all three layers of support [reports] a lower appetite to gamble and a reduction in gambling-related harms.” Moreover, it said that thanks to the TalkBanStop campaign, more people are now aware of the free tools. In other words, the necessary information has reached the people who most need it.</p>
<p>Key findings of the evaluation by Ipsos Mori revealed that people who have engaged the pilot have altered their perceptions. Users that participated in the pilot acknowledged that using tools to prevent their access to gambling websites reduced their appetite to gamble.</p>
<p>Ipsos Mori’s analysis also found that advisors, via the National Gambling Helpline, promoted Gamban and GAMSTOP successfully. People that have contacted the helpline received clear information regarding the pilot’s tools and understood the benefits of the multi-layer approach. Overall, the awareness of the gambling exclusion tools and the pilot’s services has also increased. Ipsos Mori found that more people who considered having problem gambling became aware of the tools and the pilot.</p>
<p>Since the TalkBanStop campaign started there has been huge value in the collaboration of the three partners, all of which have a shared aspiration in reducing gambling harms.” Anna Hemmings, chief executive at GamCare</p>
<p>GamCare’s chief executive, Anna Hemmings, shared her excitement by saying that thanks to the pilot and collaboration between the parties involved, people who needed help were able to access it easily. According to her, the collaboration has a great impact and helps individuals recover. Last but not least, Hemmings said that GamCare wants “TalkBanStop to become normalized as a first port of call for anyone looking to stop or control their gambling.”</p>
<p>GAMSTOP Inked Partnership with Queens Park Rangers</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the English Championship football club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) inked a key partnership with GAMSTOP. Under the deal, QPR vowed to raise awareness of tools and resources for gambling self-exclusion. Moreover, the deal will see QPR feature GAMSTOP advertising.</p>
<p>The collaboration will bring GAMSTOP animations as well as details via the club’s website and digital media channels. In addition, there will be training organized that will help QPR and the community staff better understand GAMSTOP’s platform as well as other gambling-exclusion resources.</p>
