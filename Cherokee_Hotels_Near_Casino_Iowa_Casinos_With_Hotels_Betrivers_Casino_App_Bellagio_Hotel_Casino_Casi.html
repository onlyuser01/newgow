    <h1>Cherokee Hotels Near Casino Iowa Casinos With Hotels Betrivers Casino App Bellagio Hotel Casino Casi</h1>

<p>So I explain you the expiry of my account,</p>
<p>I earned money, so I deposited 400 euros and gambled myself up to 4300 euros. I was told I have to verify myself, I did and was successfully verified. Since then I have had 3 outstanding payments on my account, totaling €1500. I couldn't withdraw anymore because that's the limit and they didn't want to process the withdrawal. I was then told the withdrawal is being processed and will arrive in your account as soon as possible. What happens after the chat 2 hours later. Write me an email with this content:</p>
<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting our Polestar Customer Service.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your account is closed for cooperation with other customers or third parties in accordance with the conditions 9.1. This includes, without limitation, playing on behalf of others, sharing information, collaborating or coordinating with others.</p>
<p>What is completely wrong is that I very often play with 2 mobile phones myself because I use one more often for private things and the other for work. So I always made payments on one cell phone and just played on the other. Now I'm being accused of giving someone my own casino account details when it's all my own mobile phones and I've done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>What I have to mention is that I have played many times with the same provider on other websites and I have used my other phone so many times and I have never been accused of anything wrong. But now at such a high amount.</p>
<p>What the casino did after the email. They closed my account and sent me an email on Monday 4 days ago that they had returned my initial deposit, so only €400. (To date I still haven't received any money not even the €400 which the casino told me it will arrive).</p>
<p>Conclusion of the whole:</p>
<p>They just accused me of something I always did for no reason and they don't want to pay out my money because it's a higher sum 4300€. I believe they are just a scam and whenever a player wants to withdraw higher amounts something happens and the casino bans you or doesn't write you back.</p>
<p>I have tried everything and have written to everyone from rabidi and from the casino but no answer. I am very sad that something like this happened to me with such a large amount. I need the money urgently because I'm in need of money and in this situation in life I don't have that much money.</p>
<p>I hope you help me with this case</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Michael</p>
