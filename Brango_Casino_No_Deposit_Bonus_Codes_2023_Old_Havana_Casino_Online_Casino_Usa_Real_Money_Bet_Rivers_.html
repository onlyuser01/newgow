<p>The 2021 World Series of Poker launches today and will run through November 23. This year, the series features a total of 88 gold bracelet events. The events will be held while following strict health and safety regulations and visitors will be required to provide proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>The World Series of Poker Returns Today at Rio in Las Vegas</p>
<p>The World Series of Poker (WSOP) marks its return with the 52nd annual series that starts today. This year, the WSOP will feature a plethora of tournaments which will run from September 30 through November 23, 2021. The location is Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and in-person and online registration for the events opened back in August.</p>
<p>This year, there will be a total of 88 bracelet events. The long-anticipated $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em World Championship event, also known as the Main Event, is expected to bring a significant number of people. While in 2020, the event attracted only some 1,300 people, this was not the case with 2019. Back then, the number of entries surpassed 8,500 people, marking the second-highest number of entries in WSOP history. Now, the event is expected to once again see record entries, despite the strict health and safety protocols that will be in place during the event.</p>
<p>2021 WSOP Offers Plenty of Action for Poker Players</p>
<p>Other tournaments that are worth noting include “The Reunion”. The tournament launches on October 1, featuring a $5 million guaranteed prize pool. On the other hand, on October 5 the $25,000 Heads Up No-Limit Hold’em Championship launches. The championship has a cap of 64 players and will undoubtedly gather the most elite players in the world.</p>
<p>Between October 8 and November 19, poker fans can also enjoy the “Return of the Record Breakers.” On Fridays and Saturdays during the 2021 WSOP, there will be flagship No-Limit Hold’em events such as Monster Stack, Double Stack, Millionaire Maker, and more.</p>
<p>Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the WSOP revealed that attendees of the 2021 WSOP must “expressly agree to comply with any and all rules and safety guidelines put in place by the event organizers.” Proof of full vaccination will be required for players who want to participate in the events. Wearing masks while players are seated at their poker table will be optional, however, they will need to wear their masks within other areas within the venue.</p>
<p>The industry-leading global nicotine brand VELO announced yesterday that it will be a primary sponsor of the 2021 WSOP. The company unveiled that it will feature multiple on and off-site activations that allow players and fans to “Never Miss a Hand.” Additionally, there will be a total of $50,000 in cash prizes for the Player of The Year as well as No Limit Leaderboard winners.</p>
<p>Ty Stewart, WSOP’s executive director, acknowledged that the WSOP is the “ultimate expression of pushing your limits to achieve your goals.” He outlined that the experience for the participants this year will be elevated thanks to the VELO sponsorship.</p>
<p>“We’re constantly exploring new and different ways to elevate our presence and enhance experiences for our age 21+ nicotine consumers.” Leila Medeiros, SVP of Next Generation Products for Reynolds</p>
<p>The SVP of Next Generation Products for Reynolds Leila Medeiros deemed the partnership as a natural fit for VELO. Additionally, she stressed that the WSOP is the most anticipated poker event. According to Medeiros, this sponsorship provides a unique opportunity for VELO to engage with poker fans and interact responsibly with nicotine consumers age 21 and older.</p>
