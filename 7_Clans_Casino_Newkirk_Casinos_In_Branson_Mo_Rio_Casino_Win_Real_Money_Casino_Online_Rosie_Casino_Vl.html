<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr. won the 2023 Home Run Derby at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, making the slugger from the Toronto Blue Jays a part of the first father and son duo to win the popular contest.</p>

<p>Guerrero Jr. entered this year’s Home Run Derby as the second favorite on DraftKings’ prop betting board at +370 odds. Two-time champion Pete Alonso from the New York Mets was the consensus favorite at +320 odds.</p>
<p>When my family pushes me to do something, usually good things happen,” said Guerrero, Jr. who last participated in the derby in 2019.</p>
<p>Guerrero Jr. put on a hitting clinic at the 2019 Home Run Derby when he crushed 91 home runs during the contest. But he lost to Alonso in the final round.</p>
<p>Vladimir Guerrero won the 2007 Home Run Derby during MLB’s All-Star festivities at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. The elder Guerrero played right field for the Anaheim Angels during the 2007 season.</p>
<p>Over a 16-season career that spanned four teams, Guerrero smacked 449 home runs and drove in 1,496 RBI, with a slashline of .318/.379/.553. In 2018, Guerrero was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown.</p>
<p>First Round: J-Rod Sets Record with Onslaught</p>
<p>Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman was the #8 seed, but the switch hitter demonstrated power by hitting 27 home runs from both sides of the plate. Chicago White Sox centerfielder Luis Robert Jr. lived up to his #1 seed when he hit 28 home runs to advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p>Alonso sought revenge on Seattle Mariners outfielder Julio Rodriguez, who knocked him out of last year’s derby. As the #2 seed, Alonso could never get any rhythm going and hit only 21 home runs. Rodriguez had the #7 seed, but the effervescent 22-year-old fed off the energy from his hometown crowd during a jaw-dropping performance. Rodriguez set a new derby record with 41 home runs in the first round. For the second year in a row, Rodriguez knocked out two-time champion Alonso.</p>
<p>I unfortunately ran into a buzz saw,” said Alonso. “He had a ridiculously historic round. That was incredible to watch.”</p>
<p>Mookie Betts from the Los Angeles Dodgers had the #3 seed, but he was the only lower seed to enter the first round as an underdog. Betts was +170 odds to win his round against #6 Guerrero Jr., who was a sizable favorite at -205 odds. In the first round, Betts belted only 11 home runs. Guerrero Jr. easily advanced to the next round with 26 home runs.</p>
<p>In the battle of two close friends and fellow Cubans, #5 Randy Arozarena from the Tampa Bay Rays squared off against #4 Adolis Garcia from the Texas Rangers. Garcia was the favorite to win the round, but he struggled with only 17 home runs. After a slow start, Arozarena tallied 24 home runs to advance to the next round.</p>
<p>Semifinals: Arozarena Goes Off, J-Rod Gassed</p>
<p>Heading into the semifinals, Rodriguez was the new betting favorite to win the Home Run Derby at +100 odds, or even money. He was ahead of Roberts (+280), Guerrero Jr. (+290), and Arozarena (+600).</p>
<p>Rodriguez knew he needed a big opening round if he wanted to defeat Alonso, so he went full gas during his 41-dinger barrage in the first round. He looked a bit tired in the second round and connected on only 20 home runs. Guerrero needed just 21 home runs to advance to the finals and knock out the young Dominican.</p>
<p>I wanted to live in the moment,” said Rodriguez. “Kind of be able to give a show to the Mariners fans and just give it my all. For that second round, I was just … gassed … but it was fun. It was fun.”</p>
<p>Rodriguez was the runner-up last year when he lost to Juan Soto in the final round of the 2022 Home Run Derby at Dodger Stadium.</p>
<p>On the other side of the bracket, Arozarena defeated Robert to advance to the finals. Robert hit 22 home runs in the semifinals, which wasn’t even close to Arozarena’s second-round bombardment. Arozarena caught fire and connected on 35 home runs in the semifinals. It was the second-most homers in this year’s contest, and Arozarena locked up a spot in the finals against Guerrero.</p>
<p>HR Derby Finals: Guerrero Outslugs Arozarena</p>
<p>The final matchup included one of the betting favorites and one of the underdogs. Guerrero Jr. was +370 odds coming into the derby as the second favorite, and Arozarena was the second-highest underdog on the board at +1100 odds. At the start of the semifinals, Arozarena was an underdog once again among the final four at +600 odds.</p>
<p>Guerrero finished this year’s derby with 72 home runs, with his manager, John Schneider, pitching to him. His home run total for the entire contest was set at 44.5 over/under, and Guerrero easily hit the over.</p>
<p>Arozarena connected on 82 total home runs, but couldn’t outduel Guerrero in the final round. Oddsmakers installed Arozarena’s total at 28.5 over/under, and the over easily hit.</p>
<p>“I feel tired,” explained Guerrero, Jr. after the final round. “But I feel happy.”</p>
<p>Guerrero was at the ballpark in San Francisco during his father’s victory in 2007, but he was only eight years old at the time.</p>
<p>I don’t remember much about 2007,” said Guerrero, Jr. “I feel very happy, very proud that my father and I both won the Derby.”</p>
<p>According to a DraftKings prop bet, Guerrero Jr defeating Arozarena in the finals paid out +1100 odds. If Arozarena pulled off the upset over Guerrero Jr., that prop bet would’ve paid out +4000 odds.</p>
