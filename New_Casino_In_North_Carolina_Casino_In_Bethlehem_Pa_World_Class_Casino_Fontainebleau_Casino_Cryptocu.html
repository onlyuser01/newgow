    <h1>New Casino In North Carolina Casino In Bethlehem Pa World Class Casino Fontainebleau Casino Cryptocu</h1>

<p>I don’t know at what point my account was fully confirmed. First they asked me for a passport and a residence permit no older than 90 days. Before loading, I asked if a selfie with a passport was required, as other casinos requested this. They answered no. Uploaded a bank statement, registration in the passport, passport. Then they asked for a selfie with a passport - I uploaded a selfie with a passport. This was all quickly checked and confirmed. Then they began to request screenshots of transactions from the crypto wallet and asked to confirm the movement of funds. I sent screenshots of my transactions, also confirmed that before making a deposit in their casino, I won in another casino and confirmed that money was coming from my cryptocurrency wallet to the card, and provided a statement. They were not happy that I took screenshots from the crypto wallet in the extension, but the difficulty was that I had a crypto wallet (browser extension), they asked me to take screenshots from the application, I somehow imported my wallet into the mobile application and provided them with screenshots. It seems like I got through it somehow, because I explained to them that I don’t really understand crypto wallets and provided what was in my power. They checked all this for about 3 days. Then they asked to be verified via Skype. I work a lot, we agreed on Tuesday, I told them the time. Then they said - by decision of the casino administration, we decided to make the payment without video verification and provide them with the payment amount + address again. I was glad that they would pay me urgently, but I have been waiting for 5 days now. They said earlier that they processed my request for payment, but for some reason due to some error the payment did not go through. They made the request again and are also diagnosing the error so that the second payment is successful. I registered at this casino for the first time through some forum back on September 17, and only on September 24 did I make my first deposit using the 120% bonus they offered in the amount of 3,723 RUB. I was very lucky. The last time I communicated with them was today about my payment, when it will be, I attached screenshots of the support response. I really want to get my winnings.</p>
