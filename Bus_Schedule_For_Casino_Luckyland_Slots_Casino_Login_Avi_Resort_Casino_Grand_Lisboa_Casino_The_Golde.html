    <h1>Bus Schedule For Casino Luckyland Slots Casino Login Avi Resort Casino Grand Lisboa Casino The Golde</h1>

<p>The digital gaming and sports entertainment leader is prepared to take the Bay State by storm with many exciting and exclusive offerings</p>
<p>An official press release revealed DraftKings’ plans for the 10 March Massachusetts online sports betting launch. The operator will utilize the next few days to the maximum, focusing on raising awareness of its imminent arrival in the Bay State via commercials and promotional events. Entering a new jurisdiction marks a significant milestone in DraftKings’ expansion efforts and should net the company substantial long-term benefits.</p>
<p>Fans Can Support Their Favorite Teams</p>
<p>10 March is fast approaching, and hopeful operators are doing their best to reach as many customers as possible during launch day. As one of the USA’s top sportsbooks, DraftKings has invested significant efforts to bolster its presence in the Bay State. The company hopes to draw in hopeful bettors with its varied selection of bet types, exclusive promotions, and ability to wager on numerous sports and leagues.</p>
<p>DraftKings has forged relationships with hometown teams like the Boston Bruins, New England Revolution, Boston Celtics, and the New England Patriots. Fans will soon be able to support their favorites and wager on exciting events like the NCAA Division I Basketball tournaments. Customers can participate via the DraftKings Sportsbook app on Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>The Operator Plans Special Promotional Events</p>
<p>In the few days before the launch, DraftKings has prepared an extensive marketing campaign, hoping to inform sports fans of the many new online sports betting opportunities. The company plans to execute several marketing campaigns before and immediately after the launch like Boston sports watch parties and an official celebration with special guests.</p>
<p>The operator has also prepared its “Bet Local” commercial, which will commence on 10 March. The promo will feature famous Massachusetts athletes and celebrities who will help spread the word and inform fans of their new ability to bet online. Such campaigns aim to elevate DraftKings and help it secure its share of the new market.</p>
<p>DraftKings Should Secure a Sizeable Market Share</p>
<p>Launching in a previously untapped jurisdiction is a golden opportunity for all operators. However, several sportsbooks allegedly pulled out of the state before launch due to stiff competition from big players like FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, and Caesars. Analysts agree that an operator would need between 7% and 8% of the overall market share to be profitable.</p>
<p>Such a milestone should be relatively easy to reach for DraftKings as the company commands substantial mindshare and has invested heavily in the launch. DraftKings co-founder, CEO, and chairman Jason Robins was excited to reach millions of new fans, delivering a safe and exciting sports betting product to the state’s diehard fans.</p>
<p>This launch will mark a major milestone for our company, and we’re proud to become the hometown sportsbook for customers in the Commonwealth. Jason Robins, DraftKings co-founder, CEO, and chairman</p>
<p>The Massachusetts launch should allow DraftKings to maintain its considerable momentum coming out of 2022. The operator’s yearly revenue hit $2.2 billion, representing a significant 73% year-over-year increase. With a positive outlook for 2023 and an entirely new market at its fingertips, DraftKings may continue to surpass expectations.</p>
