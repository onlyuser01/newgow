    <h1>Atlantis Casino Reno Rich Palms Casino Ballys Casino Ac Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta Cana Meskwaki B</h1>

<p>Nasdaq-listed, leading company boasting the most prestigious gaming brands on the planet Caesars Entertainment has announced a joint venture partnership deal with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI). According to the terms of the agreement, the two parties will work together to build and open Caesars Virginia, a $650 million casino in Danville, Virginia.</p>
<p>The Casino Will Create Thousands of New Jobs</p>
<p>The new project will be initiated this current week with ambitious plans of becoming a massive magnet for tourists in the area and the surroundings by the end of 2024, the scheduled date for its official opening. The casino will be a full-service entertainment venue that will support the local economy through thousands of new jobs in construction and operational fields. The new employees will help maintain the 500 rooms in the dedicated hotel and offer their services on the top-tier gaming floor dedicated to casino players and sports aficionados. The venue will count 1,300 slots, 85 live table games, 24 electronic table games, a World Series of Poker room, and a Caesars Sportsbook. The sportsbook app is currently live and prepared for download and registration in the state.</p>
<p>The massive resort will also offer spa services, will have its own pool, and a number of high-class bars and fine dining restaurants. Guests looking for five-star entertainment will also benefit from a live entertainment theater with 2,500 seats and a 40,000-square foot convention space.</p>
<p>Caesars Virginia to Attract Fresh Guests &amp; Caesars Rewards Loyalty Members</p>
<p>The new casino that will be managed by Caesars is expected to attract both fresh guests and current members of the Caesars Rewards loyalty program who live in the Danville area and other parts of the US.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment’s president and chief operating officer Anthony Carano expressed the company’s excitement for being able to build a “world-class Caesars resort in Danville with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a valued partner of Caesars Entertainment” for over two decades. The new casino resort is expected to bring the brand’s unparalleled service and excellent Caesars Rewards loyalty program perks, along with its “superstar entertainment talent and culinary excellence” to the people of Virginia.</p>
<p>EBCI’s principal chief Richard Sneed called the venture “a vital opportunity for our nation and our people” while mentioning the long and successful partnership with Caesars that has been further expanded with the new deal.</p>
<p>Caesars currently owns over 50 world-class resorts with one-of-a-kind amenities including Eldorado, Caesars Palace, Silver Legacy, Harrah’s, or Horseshoe. One year ago, EBCI Holdings was given the green light to buy the Caesars Southern Indiana casino.</p>
