    <h1>Casinos In New Orleans Aria Casino Duluth Casino Is Hard Rock Casino Open 24 Hours Myb Casino Soarin</h1>

<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board has announced that Soaring Eagle Gaming will become the state’s 15th online casino and sports betting operator. Soaring Eagle Gaming has partnered with GAN and met Michigan’s requirements and is live now.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Gaming Will Operate under Eagle Casino and Sports</p>
<p>Saginaw Chippewa tribe’s gaming arm will operate under the name Eagle Casino and Sports. Michigan’s law states that all players that want to enjoy the operator’s services need to be older than 21.</p>
<p>Henry Williams, Michigan Gaming Control Board’s executive director, stated that with Eagle Casino and Sports’ official authorization, the market now has 15 providers, and players of legal age (21) can register on any of these platforms.</p>
<p>He also added that all federal tribes in Michigan are now offering online sports betting and casino service. Williams concluded by congratulating the Saginaw Chippewa tribe.</p>
<p>Online betting and casino gaming were launched in Michigan on January 22, 2022. The law states that only commercial and tribal casinos can obtain licenses. The legalization of the online wagering industry proved to be a major success as the total sports betting handle for the year was almost $4 billion and December only was responsible for $500 million of that handle.</p>
<p>Recently, Michigan was also accepted into the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement. Thanks to this development, the state will share poker liquidity with Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey. Michigan’s entry into the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement opened the way for other states, one of which is Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Even though Pennsylvania is one of the largest gambling sectors in the US and is a massive proponent of interactive wagering, it showed little interest in joining MSIGA.</p>
<p>The Launch of Eagle Casino and Sports in Michigan Has Been in the Works for a While</p>
<p>Plans to launch Eagle Casino and Sports in Michigan were revealed back in November 2021. At the end of November, Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort announced that it will partner with GAN and Kambi Group and stated that it intends to launch the platform in early 2022. Fast forward to April 2022, and the platform is now live.</p>
<p>Kambi is the company’s multi-channel sportsbook and GAN is responsible for providing the platform where online games and the sportsbook will be integrated. In a statement, Soaring Eagle stated that the platform will offer a “great experience for the players.”</p>
<p>In a separate press release, GAN said that it will be working with Soaring Eagle to design an Android and iOS app and thus, make the platform as accessible as possible. Online casino games at Soaring Eagle’s platform include both slot and table games.</p>
