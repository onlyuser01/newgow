<p>Pariplay, the subsidiary of NeoGames S.A and a leading content aggregator and provider, has expanded its footprint in Latin America by receiving the green light to offer its services in Panama. As a registered supplier with the Panama Gaming Control Board, Pariplay will be able to offer its Fusion platform to local operators.</p>
<p>The Fusion Platform Will Provide Players From Panama With Over 14,000 Games</p>
<p>The Fusion platform of Pariplay is available via a simple integration and once partners utilize it, they will be able to provide their respective players with over 14,000 games by more than 80 globally renowned providers.</p>
<p>Slots, live casino games, sports betting, instant win games, virtual sports, bingo, and poker are some of the featured products.</p>
<p>Adrian Bailey, Pariplay’s managing director, commented on the company’s latest expansion. He stated that the LatAm region is growing at a very fast rate and it provides Pariplay with a lot of opportunities to introduce its products in various markets.</p>
<p>One of those markets is Panama. Bailey stated that Pariplay’s library will “resonate well with local players” and will provide them with a unique gaming experience.</p>
<p>Jorge L. Morales, Pariplay’s director for Latin America and the Caribbean, shared his thoughts as well. He said that the expansion in Panama is a major milestone and that the company has “ambitious plans” for this region.</p>
<p>He added that he’s looking forward to working with local operators to provide players with fantastic games.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s LatAm Expansion Mission Has So Far Been Very Successful</p>
<p>Pariplay considers Latin America to be of huge potential, which is why the company is dedicated to expanding to as many jurisdictions in this region as possible. Back in April, the content aggregator signed a deal with Winpot.mx, Wiztech’s Mexican subsidiary.</p>
<p>Thanks to that development, the operator will reap the benefits of the Fusion platform and provide local Mexican players with thousands of quality games.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Lotería de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires licensed Pariplay in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Buenos Aires is an autonomous region and has a population of over 3 million.</p>
<p>Bailey stated that as an autonomous region, the city of Buenos Aires “has a rich heritage in the industry” and that is one of the reasons why the company is delighted to receive a license here. He added that apart from the thousands of quality games, players will also have the chance to enjoy games “with special local appeal.”</p>
<p>Morales doubled down on Bailey’s statement by saying that receiving the license is a massive milestone and that he’s happy to be a part of the success in the region.</p>
