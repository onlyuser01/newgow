<p>This strategic partnership will equip the BIG EAST Conference with state-of-the-art monitoring software and tools from US Integrity</p>
<p>In a bid to fortify the integrity of competitions and promote awareness about the evolving sports wagering landscape, the BIG EAST Conference has entered into a comprehensive partnership with US Integrity.</p>
<p>BIG EAST Conference and US Integrity Prioritize Education in Groundbreaking Alliance</p>
<p>This strategic alliance will empower the BIG EAST Conference with cutting-edge monitoring software and tools provided by US Integrity, enhancing its ability to safeguard the integrity of sports events.</p>
<p>BIG EAST Conference officials will have access to US Integrity’s monitoring software and resources through an exclusive dashboard. The dashboard will feature regular monitoring reports and industry insights derived from US Integrity’s in-depth analysis of wagering activity.</p>
<p>However, this collaboration is not merely about surveillance. It also extends to education, with US Integrity committing to providing extensive educational resources to BIG EAST Conference student-athletes, coaches, staff, and officials.</p>
<p>The BIG EAST Conference, consisting of 11 nationally prominent colleges and universities, has a rich history of fostering healthy athletic competition and academic excellence. Established in 1979, the BIG EAST Conference is headquartered in New York City, with member institutions located in eight of the country’s top media markets.</p>
<p>BIG EAST Commissioner and US Integrity CEO Speak Out on Safeguarding Sports Integrity</p>
<p>Val Ackerman, commissioner of the BIG EAST Conference, commented on the importance of the alliance: “Protecting the integrity of our competitions and those who participate in them is of utmost importance to the BIG EAST Conference, particularly as the sports wagering landscape nationally continues to accelerate. We look forward to taking advantage of US Integrity’s state-of-the-art services to provide additional protections to our schools through enhanced monitoring and educational programs.”</p>
<p>Matthew Holt, CEO and co-founder of US Integrity, emphasized the significance of integrity measures and real-time tracking tools in the context of the expanding sports betting jurisdictions that impact the BIG EAST Conference. Holt stated that such collaborations contribute to maintaining the integrity of sports betting and enhancing the distinctive and proprietary anomaly-detection tools developed at US Integrity.</p>
<p>This collaboration comes at a crucial time as college sports have been shaken up by sports betting scandals. For example, in August, seven former and current athletes in Iowa faced charges following a sports betting investigation by the Iowa Criminal Division.</p>
<p>At the same time, the NCAA revised guidelines for student-athletes involved in gambling on college sports at their own schools. Under previous rules, such actions led to permanent loss of eligibility. Responding to concerns about excessive penalties, the NCAA now imposes a one-season suspension and a loss of one year of eligibility for those betting on teams at their school (excluding their own).</p>
