<p>It makes no sense to start playing Scackers right away with big stakes. Sometimes the game doesn't pay out in the first few rounds. In this case, you can lose the entire deposit.

<p>Moderate risk strategy in Gates of Olympus</p>
<p>Players are encouraged to start the game with $3. After 12-15 spins you should withdraw $1-1.5 every 10 spins. That's how the bank "heats" and the Gates of Olympus Variation brings you closer to bigger wins. It is also recommended to pay attention to the scatters: if the scatters start disappearing every 3-4 spins and their number increases, the multiplier will soon increase from x3 to x12. A double bet on the 3rd or 4th round of $10-15 has a 70% chance of winning back your previous 5-6 bets. This continues until the bank "burns out". Based on statistics and observations from professional players, the slot machine boosts the winnings and offers multipliers and regular symbol wins for up to three hundred spins or more!
