<p>After successful expansion in South Africa, Betfred Sportsbook is entering yet another state in the United States, bringing 50 years of bookmaking expertise to the Free State. The company will still await regulatory approvals before it can launch its full operational capacity in Maryland, and also, it is teaming up with Long Shot’s of Frederick.</p>
<p>Betfred plans to bring both a retail and mobile betting experience, but for this to happen, the online betting industry will have to be launched in the state. Right now, Maryland is considering a fall rollout of the mobile betting products, just on time for the 2022 football season.</p>
<p>But even without remote gambling options, Betfred is prepared to cater to local sports fans. For one, the company is first planning on a temporary retail sportsbook that will be located in the vicinity of Maryland Jockey Club’s OTB.</p>
<p>With this, the sportsbook will be able to present betters with food &amp; beverage options, video walls, seating, odds display, and more. The whole project is said to be at least 8,800 square feet, which will provide gamblers with a comfortable environment where they can place their bets. There will also be self-serving kiosks.</p>
<p>The partnership and pending launch have been welcomed by Long Shot’s Chief Executive Officer Alyse Cohen who said that the opportunity to bring a sportsbook to Frederick was something that truly motivated the company. This opportunity with Betfred Sports is precisely what Long Shot’s is about.</p>
<p>Cohen is confident that Long Shot’s is one of the best off-track betting locations in Maryland and as such, it will provide visitors with a great sports betting experience, no doubt bolstered by Betfred’s own dedicated offer. For the company’s part, Betfred Sports COO Bryan Bennett was equally pleased with the newly-formed alliance.</p>
<p>He said that Long Shot’s success with off-track betting is a great way to create synergies between the two companies and create some of the best sports betting experiences for gamblers in Maryland. Betfred expects that the temporary retail sportsbook will open in September.</p>
<p>Then, in 2023, the company should be able to push ahead with its permanent sportsbook. Online betting could very well be up and running by then, giving Betfred and Long Shot’s an additional edge. Elsewhere, Betfred has been doing very well.</p>
<p>Even though retail results came under heavy fire in the last reporting period, the company has been able to end the period through September 26, 2021, with more overall employees.</p>
