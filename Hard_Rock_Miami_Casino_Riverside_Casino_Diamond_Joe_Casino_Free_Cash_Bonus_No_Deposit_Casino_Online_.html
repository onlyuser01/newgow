<p>The recently updated rules implement restrictions for the simultaneous broadcasting or streaming on platforms different than Twitch</p>
<p>Much has changed on the streaming platform Twitch in the last year. Changes to its policies resulted in the ban of content from different gambling platforms, while some streamers criticized its limits related to the freedom of speech, resulting in an outflow of content creators to different platforms.</p>
<p>Kick, the Stake-owned streaming platform, welcomed those changes and was excited to see new content creators aboard. What’s more, the platform challenged Twitch’s dominance by providing lucrative financial contracts, relaxed rules and a place where blacklisted content creators can emerge once again.</p>
<p>While those changes and the consequences that followed sounded like standard business, further changes to Twitch have now shocked not only gambling streamers but other content creators as well. The new rules effectively restrict content creators from simulcasting on multiple platforms, whenever they engage in Twitch streaming.</p>
<p>“When you are streaming live on the Twitch Services you may not simultaneously live stream or broadcast (“Simulcast”) on any other “Twitch-like Service,” meaning any web-based network, platform, or service that supports live streaming of user generated content, without advance written permission from Twitch,“ read the updated terms of service from Twitch</p>
<p>Per the latest restrictions, streamers are banned from simultaneously live streaming or broadcasting their content to other platforms similar to Twitch. Such actions are restricted unless “written permission” from Twitch is secured in advance. An exception is made for mobile-first streaming services, as well as non-profit, non-commercial organizations such as government institutions.</p>
<p>“For clarity, you may Simulcast on mobile-first services that support live streaming. This Section does not apply to non-profit or government entities that are live streaming for non-commercial purposes,“ explain Twitch’s terms of service</p>
<p>It is yet to be seen how the broader Twitch streaming community will react to the latest changes. While some may transition to the platform’s competitor Kick, others may decide to stay and continue growing their position on Twitch. In light of the updated terms of service, content creators that simulcast on multiple platforms may be subject to bans or other forms of penalty from Twitch.</p>
