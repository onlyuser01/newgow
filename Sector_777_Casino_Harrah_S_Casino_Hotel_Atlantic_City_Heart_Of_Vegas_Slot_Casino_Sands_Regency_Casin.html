<p>VBET, an Armenian-based online sports betting and gaming brand, announced Ukrainian national soccer player Oleksandr Zinchenko as its official ambassador.</p>
<p>Expand Ukraine’s Presence</p>
<p>VBET, part of BetConstruct Group, announced a collaboration with the prominent soccer talent and current player of English Premier League (EPL) Manchester City as part of its ongoing efforts to establish a presence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Oleksandr Zinchenko is one of the brightest football talents of Ukraine. He will be able to present our brand like no one else. We are proud of this collaboration and will do our best to make it extremely fruitful and capable of bringing a lot of bright emotions to our fans.” George Givishvili, CEO, VBet Ukraine</p>
<p>Zinchenko, a 25-year-old left-back, joined Manchester City from Russian club Ufa in 2016, and since then has managed to win three EPL titles, one FA Cup, four EFL cups, and one FA Community Shield Cup. He also came close to winning the most prestigious soccer tournament, the Champions League, but his team lost the 2020/21 season final to local rivals Chelsea. Zinchenko, who has a total of 108 appearances, two goals, and seven assists against his name for his club, is also captain of Ukraine’s national soccer team.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to become VBet’s ambassador. Together, we’ll develop Ukrainian football and Esports, on and off the field. I believe we’ll be able to succeed and move forward.” Oleksandr Zinchenko, Ambassador, VBET</p>
<p>The collaboration will be focusing on the Ukrainian market where VBET was granted an operating license by Ukraine’s national gambling and lottery regulator KRAIL which approved the brand to operate online casinos and poker in the country.</p>
<p>Other Sports Partnerships</p>
<p>In August, VBET entered into a strategic partnership deal with Ukraine’s Ice Hockey Federation (FHU) to become the title sponsor of the Ukrainian national ice hockey team, help the federation restore the status of ice hockey as one of the most popular sports in the country and build the national ice hockey team brand to attract new young and inspired fans.</p>
<p>VBET is also partnering with the Ukraine national soccer team, Ukraine women’s national soccer team, and is a title sponsor of the Ukraine Premier League, Ukrainian Cup, and Ukrainian Super Cup. On a club level, the gaming brand is a partner of Vorskla and Oleksandriya, as well as Monaco from Ligue 1 in France and Portsmouth from the EFL.</p>
<p>VBET’s parent company BetConstruct won the Multi-Channel Supplier of the Year at the 2021 SBC Awards for its complete sports betting and gaming platform solution and as the latest recognition of its continuous efforts for improvement.</p>
