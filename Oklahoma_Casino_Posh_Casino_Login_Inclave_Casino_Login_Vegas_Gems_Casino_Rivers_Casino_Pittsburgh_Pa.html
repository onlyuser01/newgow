<p>Hello dear Radka 🙂</p>
<p>I understand and see the problem too. 🙂</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many players who give bad ratings, for example, right after 1 or 2 deposits because they unfortunately lost and they are frustrated.</p>
<p>This is exactly the point that I personally find somewhat unfair towards the casinos.</p>
<p>After all, in my opinion, your site is so well-known and successful that many players come to your site first to choose casinos, which I think is great!</p>
<p>You are doing everything really well here and I am really happy that you exist! But I would wish that there was some kind of system in which, for example, only verified players gave ratings or they were only allowed if one had a certain amount of experience in the casino.</p>
<p>I just think it takes something that satisfies both sides 🙂</p>
<p>I can really well imagine that it is very unpleasant and bad for casinos when people give bad ratings because the others might then look for something else and that will damage the casino.</p>
<p>But what bothers me personally the most, if I may be honest, is exactly this topic. 🙂</p>
<p>Yesterday I noticed at a casino that is new that it has 5 user reviews that I think 4 out of 5 reviews are fake because it is a person who writes reviews in several accounts so that the casino is presented well, which does not necessarily have to be the case .</p>
<p>I personally feel betrayed by this. 🙂</p>
<p>I wanted to register there yesterday and looked at the reviews beforehand and when I saw that I avoided the casino because I just felt a bit fooled 🙂</p>
<p>I can write to you privately which casino I mean if it should be important to you 🙂</p>
<p>✌🏼🌿✌🏽</p>
