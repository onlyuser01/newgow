<p>SOFTSWISS, a leader in the provision of innovative gaming solutions for the iGaming industry and specifically casino brands and operators, has released data from its latest analysis of how partners who use the company’s Casino Platform see their audiences interact with crypto payments.</p>
<p>According to SOFTSWISS, 85% of all consumers to whom the In-Game Currency Conversion feature is available prefer it when willing to play with cryptocurrencies. The way this works is SOFTSWISSS’ tool allows players to convert 9 different fiat currencies into their designated cryptocurrency while in-game.</p>
<p>This news comes at a time when cryptocurrency as a payment method has been gaining momentum, again based on SOFTSWISS’ comprehensive data. Apart from facilitating payments, the In-Game Currency Conversion has another function – it allows players to bet with crypto on games that do not natively support cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>According to SOFTSWISS Casino Platform’s team, 65%-70% of all players who had used the In-Game Currency Conversion at least once continue to make over 90% of the bets through this feature.</p>
<p>Another thing that the team noticed is that the retention rate of players who use the In-Game Currency Conversion is higher than those who do not. Right now, In-Game Currency Conversion accounts for 85% of the total volume of bets on crypto casinos. SOFTSWISS Casino Platform Head Darya Avtukhovich has noted that this achievement was indicative of SOFTSWISS’ ability to pioneer innovation and in a particular vertical such as cryptocurrency gambling.</p>
<p>"We understand the industry requirements thanks to our expertise and analytical work, and the result is the constant evolution of the SOFTSWISS Casino Platform, which maintains its status as one of the most reliable on the market," Avtukhovich said. The company is keen to present a lot more as part of its attendance at the SBC Summit Barcelona 2023 where it will present its Casino Platform along with other products available.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has made another observation – users who tend to use the In-Game Currency Conversion tend to be twice as involved as players who do not. According to the company, the tool also allows companies to read better into audiences and focus on the more valuable customers that they attract.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has been working hard to ensure that its offer is leading in the iGaming sector. The company secured GLI-33 and GLI-19 certifications.</p>
