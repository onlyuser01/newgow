<p>Evoplay, a provider of premium slots for the online gambling industry, announced the release of Super Bartender, its newest instant game. The new game launched Monday and takes the players to a virtual bar that grants a chance for winning big prizes thanks to multipliers.</p>
<p>Visiting a cocktail lounge, Super Bartender players can engage in exciting instant game action. The new game grants the players a chance to pick one card out of six random cards at a time. The cards feature symbols popular within classic fruit games such as lemons and cherries, while a piano soundtrack creates a relaxing atmosphere.</p>
<p>“We are so excited to stir up something different for our players and serve them a highly-engaging title that we are sure will go down a treat with fans of our perennially popular instant games.“ Ivan Kravchuk, CEO at Evoplay</p>
<p>Ivan Kravchuk, Evoplay’s CEO, shared his excitement about the latest instant game saying that the company is delighted to deliver a new title that provides a different type of experience. He explained that Super Bartender brings engaging experiences to the company’s growing player base. Last but not least, Kravchuk said: “As always, Evoplay’s bright, captivating graphics are instantly distinctive, while mechanics such as the multiplier bar add a thrilling edge that will keep players coming back for more.”</p>
<p>The Game Offers an Engaging Experience and Options for Big Wins</p>
<p>Evoplay’s newest instant game title features an RTP rate of 94.00% and a max win of €12,800 ($14,000). The game supports multiple languages and is available via desktop or mobile devices. Super Bartender displays a total of six random cards for online players. Selecting one card at a time can reveal different fruits. Once this happens, the player can pick another card or collect their winnings.</p>
<p>Revealing different fruits helps fill in a special fruit mixer that features multipliers of x2, x4, x8, x16 and x32, granting chances for massive wins. Still, Super Bartender players need to be on the lookout and avoid hitting a card with a red “X,” which can end the streak and result in losing the bet. If this happens, the mixer meter is reset, and the player starts a new round.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the players, the game offers random button functionality. Selecting this function, the game opens a random card out of the six available. Given its instant game mechanic, Super Bartender customers can collect winnings at any time, regardless of what multiplier they hit, delivering engaging and entertaining gameplay.</p>
