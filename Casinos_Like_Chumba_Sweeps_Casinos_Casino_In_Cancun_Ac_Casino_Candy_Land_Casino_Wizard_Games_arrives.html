    <h1>Casinos Like Chumba Sweeps Casinos Casino In Cancun Ac Casino Candy Land Casino Wizard Games arrives</h1>

<p>Ontario opened for business a little over a week ago, and the province has attracted interest from top igaming firms. The latest to join is Wizard Games, a content creator which focuses on online casino games. Owned by Aspire Global, the studio’s forays in Ontario mark its ambition to expand further across the North Americanmarket.</p>
<p>This may be achieved through dedicated content which the company is now bringing to the province. A big chunk of the studio’s offer focuses exclusively on slots, which is one of the most popular gaming segments and verticals. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has cleared the company to bring its dedicated variety of products.</p>
<p>Wizard Games will not be running on its own, though, and it will be integrated with Pariplay’s own aggregator platform, Fusion. Fusion already hosts thousands of games and Wizard Games will be added to the 888casino and BetMGM igaming properties already live in the province.</p>
<p>As to Wizard Games’ exact offer, the studio has over 120 titles, including Wilf Riches, Dragons of the North, and many others which will appeal to gamers in Ontario and give them a reason to want and explore the slots. Wizard Games already established itself in the European market and is also popular with players in the United States.</p>
<p>The company was able to secure market entry in key igaming jurisdictions in the USA, including New Jersey and West Virginia. Meanwhile, the company already has some experience operating in Canada. Wizard Games’ products were approved for a rollout in Alberta, another Canadian province, and are de facto known to local gamblers.</p>
<p>The news about the launch was welcomed by Wizard Games managing director Joey Hurtado who expressed his confidence that the company’s games are already performing very well in North America. Joining the Ontario igaming market is just the latest of the steps in the long journey Wizard Games has taken in the region, Hurtado assured.</p>
<p>"Together with our leading operator partners, we are excited to embark on this journey, delivering engaging and entertaining content to a brand new audience," he concluded, optimistic about the company’s future opportunities in the industry.</p>
