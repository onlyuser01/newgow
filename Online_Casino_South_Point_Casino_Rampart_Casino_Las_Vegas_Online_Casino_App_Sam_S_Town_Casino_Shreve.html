    <h1>Online Casino South Point Casino Rampart Casino Las Vegas Online Casino App Sam S Town Casino Shreve</h1>

<p>hi,i am aware of all this rules.the casino by purpose left my acount open to tempt me to gamble my wins away.after i requested acount closure to protect my wins they left it open for 48 hours due so called verification .no problem i can wait for 1 months but i requested to block my acount wich they ignored .after i lost my wins 5600€ they were very keen to close acount after i was mad at the chat ..this tells me that acount closure is possible in every moment .the verification is just a delay tactic.after i they closed my acount i told them there were some misplaced bets wich were not payed and askked to check them .they opend acount and then later i was attempted to play so i deposited 900€ and lost it in meantime they should have check on me and block the acount .if i contact my banc and request my acount to be blocked due potential fraud they will also tell me to wait 48 hours?the casino has failed with everything and they are not responsible at all .they claim to be regulsted but by whom?curacao has no regulation.to oppose all this rules on players with no legit license is just criminal.and then they know i lost 5600€ and played for 14 hours in a row is there some sense in this people to let me deposit additional 900€ .they are here for money only .they dont care if you die behind the computer .at least after all this they can solve the problem and refund my deposits .</p>
<p>conclusion:the acount should have been closed after i send them a screenshot of the misplaced bet .that moment she should have closed the acount because my request was to reopen acount only to check the relevant misplaced game round .the next day after i lost my deposit she closed acount again and was trying to breibe me with cashback and bonusses .this is not the way to handle players wich you know they have a gambling problem.this is criminal behaviour.what here happend in my country the casino would get a huge fine or even worser !</p>
