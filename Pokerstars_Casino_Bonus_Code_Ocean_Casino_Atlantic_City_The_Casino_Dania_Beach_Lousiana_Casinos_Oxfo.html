<p>During COVID-19, casinos around the world were shut down in order to prevent the virus from spreading. This meant hundreds of thousands of employees were left without employment, although some were able to still receive partial income from their employers. In many cases, especially in the US, unemployment pay was offered by federal and local governments. However, when commercial activity began to rebound, casinos found it difficult to attract workers. Many reported being short-staffed in a number of areas, and, despite unemployment pay having mostly come to an end and some properties offering lucrative signing bonuses, there are still shortages. The Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino is putting together a two-day event to give people interested in filling those positions a chance to learn what it’s like to work in the gaming and hospitality industries.</p>
<p>Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino to Hold Virtual Employment Forum</p>
<p>The Yaamava’ Resort &amp; Casino, located in Highland, CA, and run by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, is holding a two-day virtual employment event for individuals who are interested in working in gaming and hospitality. The event is free of charge and, because it’s virtual, is open to everyone, everywhere. Representatives from the tribe, as well as a few from the gaming industry, will lead a series of panel discussions to provide their insight into what employment is like from their perspective.</p>
<p>The event, Next Level Casino Careers, runs today and tomorrow, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM PT. Peter Arceo, the GM of the casino, said in an announcement about the event, “We are a culture of education, community, and innovation. This virtual event is aligned with that purpose and designed to take careers to the next level.”</p>
<p>Several Industry Executives on Hand</p>
<p>The event has the support of several executives from the gaming industry. Hector Fernandez, Aristocrat’s President of Americas, BC Slots CEO Brian Christopher and Scientific Games CEO of Gaming Matt Wilson are just a few that are listed as speakers. In addition to gaming executives, there are also representatives from aligned industries, such as hospitality, with SXM Media VP Head of Industry (Travel + Tourism) Laura Fernandez participating in a panel on business networking.</p>
<p>Also on the list of panelists, and possibly an example of the continued marriage between gambling and sports, Corey Norkin will be involved in a panel on partnerships to maximize value. Norkin is the VP of Global Partnerships for MLB’s LA Dodgers, who are currently competing against the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS.</p>
<p>Even if it weren’t for those employees who didn’t want to return to the gaming industry post-COVID-19, there are still a lot of opportunities for those considering a casino or gaming career. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics believes the gambling industry will need 24% more employees over the next ten years, in addition to the 20,500 openings presented through vacancies, with the food service management segment growing by 15% during the same period.</p>
<p>Those who want to participate in the event can sign up on the Next Level Casino Careers website.</p>
