    <h1>Mount Airy Casino Restaurants Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Michigan Riverwind Casino Concerts Casin</h1>

<p>And finally, a few questions that indicate the suspicious behavior of the betting company BETPAS in general:</p>
<p>BETPAS bookmaker belongs to a large group of Turkish illegal bookmakers supported by PronetGaming and which bookmakers are constantly hacked by illegal Turkish authorities, so they often change their url by changing the bars to their name!</p>
<p>Why did the bookmaker BETPAS send me an invitation to open an account to my e-mail, so that I could open an account later.</p>
<p>Why my account with them was exclusively in Turkish Liras and why they accepted me as a player even though I do not have a Turkish ID, because they are strictly forbidden to join non-Turkish citizens.</p>
<p>I deposited my money through EcoPayz, and now as I see the option of depositing and withdrawing through EcoPayz does not exist on their site and often there are no payment options from the legal Turkish bank, which used to have them. Now there are only payments with BTC only? ?? What happened in the meantime?</p>
<p>The other day on the Turkish forum I met an identical case with a Turkish player, but when I posted a comment on that forum, his case just evaporated from that forum?</p>
<p>And finally, logically, if I'm a hacker trying to steal money from an account, if I don't succeed, what is the logic that I spend time transferring money to the casino, then playing games there and losing money, so how come I'm not there is some winning combination, but they were all losing, so I left the site ???</p>
<p>I am writing all this to you with the aim of giving you a clearer picture of the essence of this problem. I have been damaged in many bookmakers where, although not unfair, they call on their rules to take my money, but at least there was little logic in that.</p>
<p>But here we already have a situation that should worry us all. The question is what if, according to this example, many other bookmakers do the same thing and take money from players in the same way, while gambling platforms and the licensor support it ?? With that, every reason for the existence of online betting, players, licensors of rewiew sites and everything else will be lost. I think that we must immediately stop in the way of such fraudsters and cybercriminals.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to bother you, but in my opinion this is a very explicit case and I will not allow anyone to steal my money in that way.</p>
<p>I would ask for your comment on all this and if possible independently of all how would you judge this if you were a licensor ??</p>
<p>Also, if you have a suggestion or idea, feel free to write, it might help.</p>
<p>Lots of greetings</p>
