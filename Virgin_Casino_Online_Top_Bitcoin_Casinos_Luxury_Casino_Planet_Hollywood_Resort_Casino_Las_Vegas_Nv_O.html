<p>I won't $1ooo for the first time on the site called King Billy casino,so I wanted to withdrawl $900 and keep playing with the other $155 that I had left,so I tried to do everything right by downloading my documents which now I'm scared thst they have all my details.then I tried to withdrawl from bank transfer it went in for few hours then back into the account, then I thought maybe I'll do it thru another way by waiting 3 to 7 days before goes into my account, and the same thing happened..in went back in the site account, that's when I started to think I better talk to an operator, I tried to do that,and it's a electronic system which they say they will get back to me by email as soon as they can,I waited all afternoon and night till this morning, and I have not received any thing what so ever. I start to feel anxious and I didn't feel right ,feeling that I got done,after I told my husband that I finally win something and I could pay him his money now that he originally given me from the start to play with,I was so excited, now I'm so disappointed and scared to tell my husband that it was a non legit casino,which he asked me if I was sure if it was real,I said yes I read all the information about it,and I thought I did do that,but I don't think it matters cause I did read and tried to becareful no to get a fake casino,but I think now I did again. I deposited 5 times in 1 day ,on King Billy casino yesterday before I started to win. Now I'm sad I feel ill by not getting my wins ..r u able to help me pls. I need to do something before I gave to tell me hubby that I got done again. Thank u hope to hear from u..</p>
