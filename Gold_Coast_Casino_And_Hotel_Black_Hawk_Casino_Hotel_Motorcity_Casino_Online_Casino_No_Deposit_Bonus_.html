<p>PGA Tour, PointsBet and NBC Sports have come together for a special betting simulcast during PGA Tour events starting with the Waste Management Phoenix Open on February 4.</p>
<p>NBC Steps into the World of Simulcast with PointsBet and PGA Tour</p>
<p>NBC Sports continues to seek closer partnerships with sports, and on Monday, the organization announced a collaboration with the PGA Tour and PointsBet Sportsbook for the first betting companion show.</p>
<p>Starting on time for the Waste Management Phoenix Open, golf fans will have a chance to enter a simulcast betting event that will focus on the PGA Tour event along with others to follow.</p>
<p>The new experience will be known as NBC Sports Edge BetCast and it will be available exclusively on Peacock Premium, a streaming platform that has just become the exclusive home of the WWE Network.</p>
<p>This is not the first similar initiative NBC has signed recently. Last week, the network teamed up with Boom Sports to provide fans with more free-to-play sports betting options.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, president, NBC Sports Regional Networks and executive VP, David Preschlack shared that the company was excited to be teaming up with PGA Tour and PointsBet to bring a next-generation viewership experience to consumers. He further had this to add:</p>
<p>“With TPC Scottsdale’s Stadium Course as the backdrop, we look forward to compelling sports betting presentation on Peacock Premium as a companion to watching the world’s best golfers competing on some of the most iconic holes on the PGA Tour.”</p>
<p>BetCast will not rely on the hype built up around sports betting for its success. Rather, it will have Golf Channel’s Steve Burkowski and George Savaricas as commentators, who will then be joined by PointsBet’s own star talent, Teddy Greenstein.</p>
<p>The trio will tune in for two and a half hours every day during the Phoenix Open and deliver insights during the events and beyond. BetCast will not be just a place to talk golf, though. It would also feature hard data, facts, and statistical information guiding bettors to better choices.</p>
<p>The show will have live odds and various prop bets available and all the relevant information will be updated by PointsBet with the odds sorted out by the sportsbook’s trading desk. This partnership comes amid rumors that NBC may shut down its main NBCSN sports channel by 2022.</p>
