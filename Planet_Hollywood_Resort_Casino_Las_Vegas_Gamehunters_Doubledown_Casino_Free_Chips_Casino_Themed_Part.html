    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Gamehunters Doubledown Casino Free Chips Casino Themed Part</h1>

<p>Hello, trying to get some answers on a payout that I requested 3 days ago. I'm not trying to complain, simply get answers because no one from VIP support (I was give Platinum status due to may gaming history at other locations) nor their online chat is responding or giving me an kind answer except 'we left a note for finance'.... That being said, here's the story:</p>
<p>I signed up on 11/14/2023, did a match bonus deposited approx $300 in LTC, they matched and went on to play some Gates of Olympus, get screwed (by Gates) out of a $300 bonus buy so my VIP host kicks me what he's calling $50 cash, I assume this means no playth-through or rollover requirements and move on.</p>
<p>I proceed to hit a nice $3k bonus and decide to play something else all while talking to my host on Telegram. I mentioned the bonus and he gave congrats etc, I asked him about my ability to withdrawal and he stated it'll be simple, and instant (remember this). But that I had to play through over $20,000..normally I'd not have taken a bonus like this, but I'll admit I did because A I had the $300 to lose and B I had read that they don't do roll over on another forum, but that was an obvious mistake on that posters part and me for not checking on it...again no harm, no foul.</p>
<p>I proceed to annihilate the 20k requirement and within about an hour or so I was ready to cash out 11k from my winnings. At which point as to not give the impression I was gone for ever, I did a withdrawal for 10k, and played with the rest for a bit promptly loosing, again no harm, no foul.</p>
<p>During that day I had been in pretty much constant contact with my host, asking him about the payout status, what I should expects etc...according to him, everything was peaches and creme and I should be getting by close of business. I trusted his word, and went on about my day an evening.</p>
<p>The following day, no funds, reach out to support because my host's status on Telegram was he was at home and I felt rude bothering him there. Support told me that he had left a note for finance and that I'd be getting funds shortly...that was the last time support has answered my chat requests, they now are all left on read (correction...as I am writing this...support told me "It's in queue don't worry" but has been mum on sending me a response when I (instantly) replied asking what in queue meant)</p>
<p>Again, I am just looking for support, and clarification on this...I'd really like to know the day I can expect my funds arrive. That's it, and not for one second do I feel that is too big of an ask.</p>
