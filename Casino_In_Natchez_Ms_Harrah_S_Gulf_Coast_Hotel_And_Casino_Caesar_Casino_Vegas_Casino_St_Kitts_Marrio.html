<p>Migrating Grasshoppers Swarming Across Las Vegas Strip Causing Panic Among Tourists (VIDEO)</p>

<p>Grasshoppers reminiscent of one of the Bible’s seven plagues have descended on Las Vegas, and videos taken by terrified tourists show the astounding level of critters who are in town not to gamble, but on their migration path, according to entymology experts.</p>
<p>Millions of grasshoppers have flocked to the UV lights around the Venetian, Luxor’s beam, and other major Las Vegas Strip casinos. Las Vegas has been plagued by droves of the insects migrating across Nevada. (Image: NBC News)</p>
<p>According to some scientists, the insects are set for a long run at the Strip and other parts of the town.</p>
<p>Some of you have been asking about the widespread radar returns the past few nights in #Vegas,” the NWS Las Vegas station tweeted Friday. “Radar analysis suggests most of these echoes are biological targets. This typically includes birds, bats, and bugs, and most likely in our case–&gt; Grasshoppers. 🦗 #VegasWeather.”</p>
<p>Bug experts say an abnormally wet year led to the plague-like spawning of the insects in the desert region.</p>
<p>Across social media, images abound of the insects stationing themselves at various casinos in the city. One particular landmark they’re drawn to is the Luxor Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>The pyramid-shaped resort is topped by a massive searchlight that shoots high up into the Vegas sky. On a clear night, it makes for a picturesque scene. Now, however, the swarm of insects dancing in the light can look almost apocalyptic.</p>
<p>“Something is not right in this world,” says an unnamed female voice in a video of the bugs at the Luxor that’s making the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>While some have noted the Biblical connotation of a plague of locust-like insects at a pyramid, others have said that grasshoppers are actually good luck charms.</p>
<p>On one hand I hate bugs, but on the other hand I've heard in certain cultures that grasshoppers are considered good luck. Maybe Las Vegas has a little too much good luck now — Aiden D. Ace (@AidenAces1) July 28, 2019</p>
<p>Not the First Time</p>
<p>Despite the name, the pallid-winged grasshopper is a common desert species, Nevada state entomologist Jeff Knight told reporters on Thursday. They start out earlier in the year in areas south of Las Vegas and migrate into the central part of Nevada.</p>
<p>“This is a big year, and it just happened within the last couple days,” he said.</p>
<p>While the nighttime scenes look bizarre – and frightening, to some – Knight said that the grasshoppers do not carry diseases. Nor do they bite. However, they have been an inconvenience. The Weather Service alerted drivers that the insects combined with blowing dust could limit visibility.</p>
<p>Knight said that he’s seen swarms like this invade the Las Vegas area “at least four or five times” in his more than 30 years in the industry. He expects the insects to hang around town for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The Twitter account @LasVegasTalk noted that an “exodus of grasshoppers” hit the town in 1958. The pesky bugs forced casino owners to turn off their neon marquees because they drew bugs to them.</p>
<p>No Bugs in Flights</p>
<p>Even with all the buzz about the insects, there have been no reports of casinos reporting decreased traffic because of them. It’s also been business as usual for McCarran International Airport, whose runways are only a short distance away from the Luxor.</p>
<p>Erika Hanuscin, a spokeswoman for the airport, told Casino.org Saturday that the airport has not seen any delays or cancelations due to the insects.</p>
