    <h1>Las Vegas Best Casino No Limit Coins Casino Lodge Casino Gold Country Casino Golden Nugget Lake Char</h1>

<p>The leading provider of games and technology for the online gambling sector continues to expand its global footprint and reach new customers</p>
<p>The content-driven iGaming technology provider, Bragg Gaming Group, announced a new agreement with the leading operator, Unibet, expanding the footprint of its games in the United Kingdom. Details regarding the new collaboration emerged Wednesday and see the leading betting and gaming operator introduce content from the innovative iGaming provider to its customers in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, Unibet, which is a part of the global gaming group, Kindred, has a strong presence in the UK. The company offers a plethora of casino-style games and betting options, catering to the needs of a wide range of clients. Now, thanks to the new deal with Bragg Gaming Group, Unibet will expand its offering further.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest agreement, customers of the brand will be able to access Dreamy Genie and Fairy Dust from Bragg’s Bragg Studios and Powered by Bragg content portfolio. Additionally, Unibet’s clients will be able to experience Atomic Slots Lab’s games, including Egyptian Magic, among others.</p>
<p>Besides Unibet, Bragg previously launched its content with another Kindred brand, 32Red. Now, the latest deal further complements Bragg’s growing position as a go-to provider for the online gambling industry and allows it to engage with new audiences in the UK.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this month, Bragg agreed to deliver its content for customers of FanDuel in two strategic markets, Connecticut and Michigan. Without any doubt, that deal helped strengthen the operator’s presence within the online gambling sector, while at the same time expanding its offering. Similarly, the deal expanded Bragg’s footprint in the US.</p>
<p>The iGaming Content and Technology Provider Continues to Expand</p>
<p>Gareth Jennings, Kindred’s head of RNG casino, was delighted to see games from Bragg’s extensive portfolio boost the offering of Unibet in the UK. He spoke about the quality of the iGaming developer’s content. Finally, Jennings predicted that the partnership will deliver success and said that Kindred is delighted to continue collaborating with Bragg.</p>
<p>“We’re used to the level of quality we get from Bragg games and they will be a very welcome addition to our lobby in the UK as they have been elsewhere.“ Gareth Jennings, head of RNG casino at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Back in July, Bragg forged a global distribution alliance with the renowned betting and gaming company, 888 Holdings. Thanks to this deal, exclusive content from Bragg was delivered for multiple brands of the company.</p>
<p>“Having seen the way our product is expertly handled and taken to market by Unibet in other regions, going live in the UK with its popular platform there was an easy decision.“ Lara Falzon, president and COO at Bragg Gaming Group</p>
<p>Lara Falzon, Bragg’s president and COO, said that the company is delighted to deliver its products for Unibet, especially considering the brand’s strong presence in many regions, including the UK. Finally, she said that the latest deal boosts Bragg’s footprint in Europe and complements its growth.</p>
