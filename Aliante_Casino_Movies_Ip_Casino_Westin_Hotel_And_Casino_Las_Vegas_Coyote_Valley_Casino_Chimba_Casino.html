<p>Denver Broncos vs. Chicago Bears is a duel between teams that are still without a single win in the 2023 NFL</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Broncos suffered the biggest loss in the history of the franchise. They got obliterated by the Miami Dolphins 70-20, suffering their third straight loss. Bouncing from such a humiliating loss is difficult, but on the bright side, Sean Payton’s men have a relatively easy job on their hands in Week 4. On Sunday afternoon, they’re taking on the Chicago Bears, which is also 0-3 this season.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, the Broncos would have no problems beating the Bears, who in 2023 don’t seem like a team that can achieve much. However, the boys from Colorado might be too shaken up by last weekend’s loss, which is something the Bears will be looking to take advantage of.</p>

<p>Denver Broncos Need to Dig Themselves Out of the Pit</p>
<p>It’s 100% certain that the atmosphere isn’t good in the Denver Broncos locker room after the embarrassing loss to the Miami Dolphins. Denver’s defensive team probably has no confidence in its abilities after allowing 10 touchdowns in Florida.</p>

<p>🔰The Miami Dolphins defeated the Denver Broncos in a historic 70-20 victory at Hard Rock Stadium on September 24, 2023</p>
<p>🔰The Dolphins broke franchise scoring record, which was their previously set on November 24, 1977, with 56… pic.twitter.com/OR0MEGXlg3 — Zim Mgo (@Tlepabc) September 25, 2023</p>
<p>The reason why this is such a huge problem is that the defense used to be Denver’s strongest point for a couple of seasons. Their offense wasn’t too productive in the past, which is why they decided to sign Russell Wilson who was supposed to take the team to the next level. But he still hasn’t done it.</p>
<p>He did relatively well in the three games the Broncos have played so far in the 2023 season, but he’ll have to do even better in the future. Luckily for him and his teammates, they should have an easy job against the Bears who just aren’t great defensively.</p>
<p>Chicago Bears Looking to Take Advantage of the Situation</p>
<p>The Bears are 0-3 so far, with losses to the Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Kansas City Chiefs. Sure, those are tough opponents, but the Bears did get hammered by each of them.</p>
<p>It’s mainly because Chicago’s defensive team did not do great. In total, these guys have conceded 106 points. That accounts for 35.33 per game, meaning that if it weren’t for the Broncos, they’d be the team with the worst defense in the NFL.</p>
<p>The Bears’ offense hasn’t been too impressive either, but it’s due to the fact that they’ve played against teams that are great defensively. Does this mean they’re going to run riot on Denver’s defense in Week 4?</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Chicago Bears Prediction</p>
<p>The Broncos are 4-13 with Russell Wilson as their quarterback, which needs to change ASAP. Alarm bells are ringing, meaning that it’s now or never for the Broncos to start winning again.</p>
