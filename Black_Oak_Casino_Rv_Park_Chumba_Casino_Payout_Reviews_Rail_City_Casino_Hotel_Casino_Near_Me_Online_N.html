<p>Gaming Corps secured the license ahead of the introduction of new rules that will regulate B2B companies in the country</p>
<p>Gaming Corps, a gaming software developer, has secured a license from the Swedish Gaming Authority. The permit has a validity of five years and will allow the company to manage gaming software in its native market.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps, which is a company based in Sweden, has secured the new license in the wake of the introduction of new requirements in the Swedish market. The country recently decided to regulate B2B gaming companies and, starting July 1 will only allow licensed suppliers.</p>
<p>The new license is an important development for Gaming Corps, which will be able to continue doing business locally, supplying licensed iGaming operators with its rich selection of innovative games. The developer boasts a diverse portfolio of premium table games, slots, crash games, mine games and a certified Plinko.</p>
<p>Many of Gaming Corps’ games are hits that constantly attract new players to its partnering operators’ platforms. Such successes include titles like Coin Miner, Penalty Champion, Jet Lucky 2, Raging Zeus Mines &amp; Aztec Bonus Pot.</p>
<p>The new license will further consolidate Gaming Corps’ presence in Europe. The company already holds licenses in a number of notable regions, including Gibraltar, the Netherlands, Greece, Estonia and Spain.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps Is Bullish on Expanding</p>
<p>Gaming Corps’ chief executive officer, Juha Kauppinen, commented on the development, saying that his team feels gratified to have secured a license in yet another market. He noted that Gaming Corps is bullish on expanding the number of markets where players can access the developer’s premium gaming content.</p>
<p>Now that Gaming Corps holds a license in Sweden, it will be able to better protect players from harm and promote safer gambling in the region. Kauppinen said:</p>
<p>The new license regulations in Sweden are a very positive step to help protect players and promote safer gambling, and we are very happy to offer our games to players in line with these new regulations as a licensed games developer. Juha Kauppinen, CEO, Gaming Corps</p>
<p>Gaming Corps recently struck a chain of content agreements with several companies. Most recently, the provider supplied games to the Estonian operator Coolbet, allowing it to grow its regional presence. A few days earlier, Gaming Corps also signed a partnership agreement with Play North, agreeing to power the operator with content.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Gaming Corps also injected content into SoftGaming’s aggregation platform, boosting its reach.</p>
