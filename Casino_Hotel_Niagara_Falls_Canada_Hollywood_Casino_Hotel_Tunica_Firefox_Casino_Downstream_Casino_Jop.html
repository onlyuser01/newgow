<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), the world’s premier mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, announced an exciting multi-year partnership with the popular free-to-play social casino platform Roobet.fun. The two parties will leverage UFC’s massive viewership to bolster their offerings, playing to their mutual strengths. Their shared values provide a stable foundation for a positive and long-lasting relationship.</p>
<p>The Deal Expands on Previous Shared Projects</p>
<p>Roobet.fun’s new collaboration with the UFC builds upon its existing ties with the organization. The social game operator produces several popular podcasts like On the House with MMA agent Jason House and Champions Corner, featuring former UFC flyweight champion Brandon Moreno. Roobet’s close relations with the UFC will significantly enhance their future collaborations and provide lasting value.</p>
<p>The new multi-year partnership will enhance Roobet.fun’s exposure inside the UFC octagon, extending to select UFC pay-per-view events and Fight Nights. This prime placement exposes the brand to millions of viewers worldwide, enhancing its visibility in the gaming and betting markets. Roobet.fun co-founder and head of partnerships Anthony Brennan noted the partnership would give fans exciting and groundbreaking experiences.</p>

<p>In addition to the octagon branding, Roobet.fun will be featured as a presenting partner on select episodes of UFC’s highly acclaimed Embedded series, offering fans an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at top UFC athletes as they prepare for upcoming fights. The two parties will also collaborate on content across UFC-owned social media channels and digital platforms.</p>
<p>MMA Fans Will Be the Biggest Winners</p>
<p>This collaboration presents the UFC with a strategic opportunity to strengthen its leadership position as a global sports and entertainment powerhouse. By aligning with a dynamic and forward-thinking gaming platform like Roobet.fun, the organization can explore new avenues to connect with fans and enhance its presence in the rapidly evolving world of online entertainment.</p>
<p>Such positive news arrives at the perfect time for the UFC as it recovers from its recent integrity scandals. The Championship has taken significant steps to address its deficiencies and now seeks to strengthen its brand name and move away from past controversies. The UFC’s fan-centric approach has worked well so far and should continue to drive engagement and ensure MMA’s lasting popularity.</p>
<p>Roobet.fun’s innovative gaming platform will add a new layer of excitement and entertainment to the upcoming UFC events and Embedded series. As the partnership unfolds, both parties are poised to significantly impact the gaming and sports entertainment landscape, redefining fan engagement and creating a win-win situation for all involved.</p>
