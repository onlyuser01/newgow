<p>ORYX Gaming, owned by Bragg Gaming Company, has announced that it will be able to provide gambling operators with exclusive content through the White Hat Gaming platform. ORYX will distribute its products through White Hat’s established network of partner operators starting in December.</p>
<p>The first batch of games will be delivered in the coming weeks, with most titles coming from 2022 on in. ORYX will be able to reach at least 40 new brands in Europe and the United Kingdom, owing to a license from the UK Gambling Commission and multiple licenses with local jurisdictions across the continent.</p>
<p>White Hat is available in jurisdictions covered by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) licensing conditions, and ORYX is set to benefit from a significant commercial expansion. Bragg COO Chris Looney has welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with White Hat Gaming as an established platform provider that will get the ORYX games to more players.</p>
<p>“The range of brands to whom we can provide our exclusive iGaming content has been strengthened, especially in the UK where we’re looking to leverage our new license. This agreement meets our goals and emboldens us as we continue to push on across Europe.” Bragg COO Chris Looney</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming head of content Kola Okoko was equally pleased to be welcoming the ORYX Gaming portfolio to the company’s dedicated distribution platform. “We’re always looking to add the best titles and grow our offering, and this deal with ORYX makes our portfolio that much more appealing,” Okoko added.</p>
<p>A Global Focus on Content Distribution</p>
<p>White Hat Gaming is confident that the games that will be coming as a result of the partnership will be well-received by players with more titles in the pipeline, all pointing to a flourishing partnership.</p>
<p>ORYX has been looking to consolidate its presence across various channels, boosting awareness for its portfolio of games. In one such initiative, ORYX successfully negotiated for its products to be featured as part of Mr Gamble’s Twitch stream, which, while sporting a modest audience, is a new way to engage with consumers.</p>
<p>Europe is hardly the only focus for White Hat Gaming which announced a new dedicated division that will focus fully on the US iGaming market. Scientific Games signed a content partnership with White Hat Studios, the US-oriented division, in October.</p>
