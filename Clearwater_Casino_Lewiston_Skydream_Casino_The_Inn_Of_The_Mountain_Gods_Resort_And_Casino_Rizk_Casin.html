    <h1>Clearwater Casino Lewiston Skydream Casino The Inn Of The Mountain Gods Resort And Casino Rizk Casin</h1>

<p>DraftKings and CQ Holding Company are bringing their partnership onto a new level with the opening of a second retail sportsbook in Louisiana. The new property follows the pair’s forays in Illinois where they also worked on the introduction of a 6,000 square feet property which is now up and running.</p>
<p>The new property in Louisiana is based at the Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and will serve as a temporary home to sports betting operations for the two companies in the state. The property is equipped with 20 self-serve kiosks and has three over-the-counter booths for purchasing tickets.</p>
<p>DraftKings Ties Sports Betting in the Gaming Floor</p>
<p>This comes on top of the already existing gaming space on the Mississippi River which features over 860 gaming machines along with 12 dedicated tables. Riverboat casinos continue to be a permanent fixture of Louisiana’s gambling landscape.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opening, DraftKings senior director of retail sportsbooks Michael Kibort said that the company was excited to showcase its expertise and bring a second sportsbook in the region:</p>
<p>“Through our collaboration with CQ Holding Company and Hollywood Casino, we look forward to revolutionizing the sports betting experience, while providing sports fans with an outstanding entertainment facility in Baton Rouge.” DraftKings senior director of retail sportsbooks Michael Kibort</p>
<p>However, this is just a temporary solution and it will later move to the commercial casino that is currently being built in the vicinity. The land-based facility is bang next to the boat and will make it easy for frequent customers to keep trickling in once the property is complete. The new Hollywood Casino will significantly up the available gaming space.</p>
<p>Presently, the boat has around 27,000 square feet but this will go up to 100,000 square feet once the building is complete. CQ Holding Company CEO and president Terry Downey added:</p>
<p>“The temporary DraftKings Sportsbook at Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge will provide customers with new, exciting ways to enjoy this historic property, and we’re thrilled our expanded DraftKings partnership will offer guests its premier sports betting technology.” CQ Holding Company CEO and president Terry Downey</p>
<p>Previous Attempts So Far Successful</p>
<p>Downey is confident that the new venue will be an opportunity for bettors to immerse themselves in an advanced sports betting environment. Downey said that customers can expect a new way to enjoy sports at the Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge both as part of the temporary and later permanent sportsbook.</p>
<p>DraftKings and CQ Holding Company have already launched their permanent sportsbook in Casino Queen. DraftKings launched a temporary sportsbook in Illinois back in 2020 prior to going ahead with the official launch earlier this week for the permanent one.</p>
