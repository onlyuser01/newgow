<p>Please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino and we will try our best to help.</p>
<p>We are sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion.</p>
<p>You can also contact the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) ( Lodge a Complaint - Malta Gaming Authority (mga.org.mt) ) and submit a complaint to them. It's a good licensing authority and it might have better options and tools to help players. Please let me know how the MGA responded ( michal.k@casino.guru )</p>
<p>If you feel you want to take this complaint further, you can contact the casino's official ADR Maltese Alternative Dispute Resolution Entity (MADRE) here https://madre-online.eu/file-a-claim-international/</p>
<p>We will mark the complaint as "unresolved" in our system. We understand this isn't a satisfactory solution to your issue. However, the decrease in the rating caused by unresolved complaints might help to change the casino's approach. If the casino decides to reopen the complaint, you will be notified by email.</p>
<p>We have conveyed our standpoint to the casino team, however, regrettably, we were unable to reach a mutually agreeable solution with them, as they have maintained their initial decision.</p>
<p>While we acknowledge the evidence provided by the casino team that the player has previously violated terms and conditions in other casinos within the same group, leading to the decision to flag the player as suspicious, we find that the player has adhered to all rules in this specific casino. The player has rightfully obtained their winnings in accordance with the established regulations, and thus, we do not view it as justifiable to nullify the player's winnings in this particular case.</p>
<p>After a throughout discussion and consideration of all the facts, we have come to the following conclusion:</p>
