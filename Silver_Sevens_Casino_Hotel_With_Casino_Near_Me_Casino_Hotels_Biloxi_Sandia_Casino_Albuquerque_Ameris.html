    <h1>Silver Sevens Casino Hotel With Casino Near Me Casino Hotels Biloxi Sandia Casino Albuquerque Ameris</h1>

<p>A leading supplier of official sports data and data-driven content entered into a deal with the largest US casino operator to accelerate its market growth.</p>
<p>A new strategic partnership deal between Genius Sports and Caesars Entertainment will cover the whole spectrum of sports data content offering of the data supplier, including its customer acquisition tools and fan engagement solutions. According to the agreement, Caesars’ entire portfolio of casinos, sportsbooks and other wagering entities will gain access to Genius’ official data.</p>
<p>We are thrilled that Caesars Entertainment has recognized our investment in official sports data as it fuels the next generation of fan experiences. Our range of live sport, in-game betting products and media services will support Caesars’ acceleration of its U.S. market growth, through exciting new brand, acquisition and monetization opportunities.” Mark Locke, CEO, Genius Sports</p>
<p>A big part of the deal involves access for Caesars trading and sportsbook platform to official NFL products and data feeds, to expand on a previous NFL official sports betting partnership and further the casino operator’s NFL-backed sportsbook offering with official league data and Next Gen Stats supplied by the exclusive NFL data provider.</p>
<p>We are excited to see the continued growth in the relationship between Caesars and Genius, two key strategic League partners. NFL fans expect the best, and the combination of their data, capabilities and resources ensure they will provide our fans with exceptional betting experiences.” Christopher Halpin, Chief Strategy &amp; Growth Officer, NFL</p>
<p>In addition, Genius Sports will become a programmatic advertising partner of the casino operator and will provide its suite of technology tools to boost customer acquisition, fan engagement and client retention for Caesars’ sportsbook and casino products. Kenneth Fuchs, Caesars’ Head of Sports, is optimistic that this partnership will enhance the operator’s NFL sportsbook offerings and give customers a “more engaging and exciting” interaction with the brand.</p>
<p>Official Data from Other Sports Competitions</p>
<p>Besides Genius Sports’ NFL products, Caesars will gain access to the official data and in-play content from other premier US sports organizations like NASCAR, as well as content from the English Premier League, Liga MX, DIMAYOR and Argentinian soccer.</p>
<p>True to the Caesars experience, it’s our goal to treat our sports bettors like royalty. We know how exciting NFL betting is for our players and through our partnership with Genius, we can now provide bettors with the live NFL data they need to make wagers like a true Caesar.” Kenneth Fuchs, Head of Sports, Caesars Entertainment</p>
<p>Last month, Caesars launched Caesars Sportsbook, the most dynamic sports betting app, powered by data science, analytics and proprietary development, and supported by a global team. Looking to treat every sports bettor “like a Caesar,” the betting platform offers extensive odds, flexible limits and access to the operator’s loyalty program.</p>
<p>The partnership with Genius Sports comes hot on the heels of another important development for Caesars, the sale of William Hill’s non-US assets to Gibraltar-based 888 Holdings in a reported $2.75-billion deal that will allow the US casino giant to focus entirely on its domestic market.</p>
