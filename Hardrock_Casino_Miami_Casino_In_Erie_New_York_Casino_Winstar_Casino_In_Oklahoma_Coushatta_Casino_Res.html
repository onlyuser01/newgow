<p>Push Gaming continues to grow its footprint in the Dutch gambling market with the B2B gaming supplier entering a new competitive deal with Play North, an established local operator of iGaming products and entertainment. The partnership enables Push Gaming to deploy a number of its own unique and player-favorite games which are now available to Play North audiences.</p>
<p>Push Gaming to Now Power Play North Gaming Brands in the Netherlands</p>
<p>Among those games are Deadly 5, Mad Cars, Big Bamboo, Jammin’ Jars, and others. Players who are keen to explore the full portfolio will be able to do so through one of Play North’s many established brands in the country, including Kansino, Pikakasino, Rocket Casino, and Kiirkasiino.</p>
<p>Push Gaming is bringing along with it a dedicated RGS platform that will make the integration, management, and promotion of the new games much easier and more intuitive. This is the latest commercial partnership for Push Gaming which is actively seeking to expand its reach in regulated markets, with the Netherlands playing a big role in that strategy.</p>
<p>Push Gaming has recently signed a partnership with Rivalo to enter the Colombian gaming market and the company explored another top-tier partnership with Sky Betting and Gaming.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest tie-up with Play North, Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey said that the company was pleased to be teaming with the casinos and brands. The agreement is a step up for the supplier in the Netherlands, enabling the company to pursue its growth objectives. She added:</p>
<p>This partnership will enhance our presence further in the Dutch market and maintain our trajectory as we continue to grow not just in Europe but in several wider global regions.</p>
<p>Play North Head of Casino Daphne Xerri also joined and said that the quality and innovation captured by Push Gaming’s extensive catalog of titles is an important opportunity for the company’s operators to deliver an excellent quality of entertainment. “We look forward to seeing how our players react to Push Gaming’s entertaining and award-winning games now being offered through our casinos,” Xerri concluded.</p>
