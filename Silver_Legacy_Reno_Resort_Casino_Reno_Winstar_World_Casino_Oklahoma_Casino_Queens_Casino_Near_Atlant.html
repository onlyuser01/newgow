<p>Thank you for your reply, Beast777. I would like to emphasize that we accept the situation when the casino allows players from restricted countries to open an account as long as they don’t use this as an opportunity to later cancel the player’s legitimate winnings. Simply said – if the casino allows players from restricted countries to deposit and play, they should pay out their winnings as well. However, if the player personally chose to make deposits and lost, we believe they are not eligible for any refunds because they could lose their deposits in the same manner at any other casino.</p>
<p>Therefore, we investigate further and help only those players, whose funds or winnings have been confiscated due to being from a restricted country.</p>
<p>Please, if there is anything else, we could help you with, do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise, we will reject this complaint. Thank you for understanding.</p>
