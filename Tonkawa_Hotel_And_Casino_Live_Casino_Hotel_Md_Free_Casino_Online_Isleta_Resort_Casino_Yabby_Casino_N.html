<p>Leading gambling platform and services provider OpenBet has agreed to leverage its capabilities to facilitate the launch of Sports Illustrated Sportsbook’s first retail location. The brick-and-mortar sportsbook, which launches as a result of the partnership between Sports Illustrated and 888, will mark the former company’s foray into the retail sector.</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated and its parent company Authentic Brands Group first joined forces with 888 in 2021, seeking to conquer the digital sports betting market. The success of the partnership has now prompted Sports Illustrated’s desire to replicate its digital success in the retail betting market as well.</p>
<p>Because of its reputation, OpenBet was selected to facilitate this venture and help Sports Illustrated and 888 take the retail market by storm.</p>
<p>As agreed, OpenBet will supply world-class sportsbook technology to the sportsbook, located at the Island Resort &amp; Casino in Michigan. The provision agreement will see OpenBet provide the sportsbook with a variety of products and services including state-of-the-art betting counters and self-service kiosks.</p>
<p>Thanks to OpenBet’s comprehensive Trading System, customers of the sportsbooks can enjoy a huge selection of betting options, including same-game parlays, in-game wagering, teasers, futures, and player props.</p>
<p>The deal cements OpenBet as a leading provider of betting solutions in the United States. It follows a LATAM-facing agreement between the provider and Play7.Bet.</p>
<p>The Deal Paints a Promising Future for Betting in Michigan</p>
<p>OpenBet’s vice president for the US, Deb Krupinski, commented on the new partnership, expressing her team’s excitement about the tie-up with 888 and Sports Illustrated Sportsbook.</p>
<p>We are delighted to partner with 888 and Sports Illustrated Sportsbook to power their first-ever retail launch. Customers at the Island Resort &amp; Casino in Michigan can now immerse themselves in the ultimate sports betting experience in a safe and secure environment. Deb Krupinski, VP US, OpenBet</p>
<p>Krupinski added that his team is excited to deliver its solutions to an iconic sportsbook and called the partnership agreement a “significant milestone” for OpenBet. He reiterated his team’s commitment to supplying its clients with cutting-edge tech and unrivaled content and expressed his excitement about the future of the partnership.</p>
<p>888 Holdings’ US president, Howard Mittman, also commented on the new alliance and celebrated the launch of the new Sports Illustrated Sportsbook, powered by OpenBet. He added that the agreement with OpenBet “paints a promising future” for the Michigan retail betting landscape.</p>
