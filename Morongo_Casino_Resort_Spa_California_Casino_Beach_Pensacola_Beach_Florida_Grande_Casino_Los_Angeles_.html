<p>ZeroFlucs, a company that offers unique software powering racing and sports markets, announced a strategic appointment on Friday. The company revealed that it hired Benjie Cherniak to serve as its strategic advisor.</p>
<p>Joining ZeroFlucs, Cherniak brings more than 15 years of experience within the sports betting industry. As an industry veteran, he has significant knowledge of international and US-facing markets. In his new position, Cherniak is expected to help ZeroFlucs continue its growth.</p>
<p>The company has come a long way since its foundation back in 2021. The start-up took the Australian market by storm offering leading technology for wagering service providers. Now, having Cherniak on its side, ZeroFlucs seeks to expand further in Australia but also aims at the growing sports market in North America.</p>
<p>According to a statement released on November 11, 2022, the company's software "enables sports betting operators to dramatically augment their pricing offerings while leveraging their own existing data sources and relationships." Such options include blended betting, same-race and same-game parlays and more.</p>
<p>Steve Gray, ZeroFlucs' founder and sports wagering industry veteran in Australia, commented saying: "Working with Benjie has been absolutely pivotal for us: helping us refine our product positioning and messaging, as well as providing contacts and market insight."</p>
<p>Moreover, he acknowledged that Cherniak has a track record in the industry and is respected by the operators he worked with in the past decades. Finally, Gray said: "It's hard to imagine a better partner for us on this journey."</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Cherniak added: "ZeroFlucs technology is a game changer for race and sportsbook operators." He explained: "That they can significantly augment market offerings is a big win - but that they can do so utilizing an operator's existing pricing feeds ensures pricing accuracy and an enhanced user experience, thus differentiating from the competition."</p>
<p>Cherniak revealed that it is exciting to join Gray's team of dedicated professionals at ZeroFlucs. Finally, he said that he is looking forward to the growth of the company in Australia and internationally.</p>
<p>ZeroFlucs is a company that leverages decades of experience in technology including slot machines, interactive gaming and wagering. The company's software stands out with high-performance thanks to the use of modern coding languages and offers stability as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ZeroFlucs' software is designed in a way to fit the needs of operators within any location of the globe, seeking to support businesses and help them grow. Other main priorities for the company are consistency and flexibility, as ZeroFlucs delivers products that can help operators customize their margins to fit their needs.</p>
