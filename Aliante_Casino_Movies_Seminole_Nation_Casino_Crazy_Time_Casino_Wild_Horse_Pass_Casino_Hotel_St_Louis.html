<p>“Our partnership with Betfred enables us to enhance the fan experience and helps provide additional opportunities to engage with our ever-growing Red-and-White Community.“ Doug Raftery, executive business officer at Loudoun United FC</p>
<p>Bryan Bennett, Betfred USA Sports’ COO, acknowledged that the company has collaborated with many soccer clubs in the UK. At the same time, he added that the new deal marks an exciting moment as the collaboration with Loudoun United is the first US-facing deal with a soccer team.</p>
<p>“Betfred has a long history of successful sponsorships of soccer clubs in the UK, and we couldn’t be more excited to enter into our first partnership in the US with Loudoun United.“ Bryan Bennett, COO of Betfred USA Sports</p>
<p>Bennett pointed out that in the last few years, the team developed a large fan base. Last but not least, the COO said that Betfred is looking forward to delivering unique experiences for fans of the soccer team via Betfred Sportsbook in Virginia.</p>
