    <h1>Stars Casino Bonus Code St Louis Casinos Hotels Resort World Casino Turning Stone Casino Lodge Misso</h1>

<p>Dear Sam,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"In general, there is a 35x (times) wagering requirement linked to all bonuses which also extends to the qualifying deposit amount. Unless specifically stated otherwise, this translates into the following example: Player deposits $30 and receives a 100% deposit bonus worth of $30. In order to meet the wagering requirements, the player has to stake $60 (deposit+ bonus) x 35 = $2,100. Then, the player can withdraw the bonus money and any potential winnings made from it."</p>
<p>"Players wishing to withdraw their balance while an Active Bonus is in effect have the option of contacting the Customer Support Team. However, the Active Bonus and all winnings associated with it from both the Cash Balance as well as the Bonus Balance will be declared void."</p>
<p>Please could you confirm that you have activated a bonus and you would like to withdraw your promotional winnings? If yes, please forward me a link of the specific bonus that you have redeemed. Please remember, the wagering requirements don’t apply to the real money play. Thank you in advance for your reply. I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
