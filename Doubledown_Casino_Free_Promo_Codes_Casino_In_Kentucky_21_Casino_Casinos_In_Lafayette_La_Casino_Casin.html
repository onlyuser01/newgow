    <h1>Doubledown Casino Free Promo Codes Casino In Kentucky 21 Casino Casinos In Lafayette La Casino Casin</h1>

<p>Dear e965001,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked the terms and conditions, and this is what I found https://gg.bet/en/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>8.3. The customer confirms that they will only deposit funds from their own account, bank card, or system, registered in the customer’s name, and will only use their means of payment to deposit funds to their own account. The customer must not use the details of third parties to withdraw funds and must not allow third parties to make withdrawals using the customer’s payment details. If it is established that this term has been violated, we reserve the right to request documents from the customer and the owner of the payment details. In the event that these documents cannot be provided, we reserve the right to block the account in question and stop any activity on it until the identity confirmation process has been successfully completed. If this term is violated again, the accounts in question will be blocked and all winnings will be confiscated. In the event that a customer adds an additional payment option, they agree to complete an additional verification process for that payment method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check our Fair Gambling Codex for Players https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-players :</p>
<p>"Payments</p>
<p>For deposits and withdrawals, you should only use bank accounts and credit cards held in your own name. If you don't do this, you might get into trouble when trying to make a withdrawal. This rule is mostly in place to prevent credit card misuse and also because of international anti-money-laundering regulations."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing or withdrawing funds using a joint card or this possibility is communicated beforehand. Technically it is very difficult to check who’s the owner of the payment method at the depositing stage. This can be checked only during account verification, which is usually done when a withdrawal is requested. Therefore, it is a player’s responsibility to use allowed payment methods only.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to prove that you are a legitimate owner of the payment method and you haven’t received approval from the casino allowing you to use a third-party payment method, I’m afraid there’s not much we can do for you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tomas</p>
