    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Dining Casino Video Zitobox Casino Tropicana Casino Pioneer Casino Laughlin Flutter</h1>

<p>Flutter Entertainment and its cutting-edge poker platform, PokerStars, are at the forefront of innovation in the vertical with the companies announcing that they are rebranding the virtual reality (VR) product launched several years back in 2018.</p>
<p>PokerStars VR will now be known as Vegas Infinite, a part of a broader and more ambitious project within the PokerStars brand. Vegas Infinite wants to establish itself as the next-generation virtual entertainment destination, an effort undertaken by many companies in the gambling space and pivoting heavily towardsinnovative technologies such as 3D, VR &amp; AR, blockchain, NFTs, and more.</p>
<p>Vegas Infinite is in many regards like a scaled metaverse where players can enjoy personal player suites, luxury casinos, and rooftop escapes, the press release informs. To access Vegas Infinite, players may connect via Meta Quest VR or Steam VR, and to improve accessibility for consumers – no headset is actually required.</p>
<p>PokerStars VR solution was launched before the Flutter acquisition of the brand in 2021. When this happened, the parent company deployed its Flutter Edge portfolio of solutions which are designed to boost the overall performance of the platform which has now got a new look and feel.</p>
<p>PokerStars Director of VR &amp; Innovation James O’Reilly also welcomed the opportunity to see this interesting product reimagined once again and streamlined to cater to an avid community of players.</p>
<p>"Today, we're much more than poker and much more than VR. Vegas Infinite is where we're taking our players next and there's lots more in store," O’Reilly said speaking of the company’s flexible and well-rounded product that is poised to lead the world of entertainment.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Vegas Infinity uses ToxMod, an AI live chat that helps a dedicated moderation team, and further adds to the level of player safety found on the website. Players can themselves access numerous in-game tools designed to help them control their spending limits as well as track how much money they have spent in general.</p>
<p>All of this is done in a frictionless yet efficient manner, PokerStars says. Vegas Infinite also brings a number of other excellent products to revitalize the poker gameplay by adding some more "casual" experiences such as blackjack, roulette, craps, slots, and Rocket Rush, an in-house product by the company.</p>
<p>Although its high buzz and wow-factor value, VR is still a fairly nascent part of the gambling industry – be that poker or other verticals, and its adoption, while inevitable, will take time.</p>
