<p>The leading gaming and betting company continues its European expansion and confirmed plans to launch its flagship brand in France later this year</p>
<p>Betsson Group, the globally recognized betting and gaming operator, announced today that it secured an important license, allowing it to continue its European expansion. The company revealed that it was granted a license in France, allowing it to roll out its sports betting services within the regulated gambling market in the country.</p>
<p>The market entry comes as a result of a collaboration with a local partner, explained the Group. Moreover, it added that it plans to launch Betsson, its flagship brand, at some point during the fourth quarter of this year. Undoubtedly, the market entry in France represents an important achievement for the company on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>The Group explained that its sportsbook in France will benefit from OMEGA Systems’ robust Player Account Management system. Moreover, the Betsson sportsbook will be powered by Sportradar and will leverage innovative and engaging features delivered by Goma Development. Such user-friendly features are ultimately expected to deliver unrivaled betting experiences for French bettors and sports fans alike.</p>
<p>The latest entry of the Group in France propels its global expansion. It enables the company to roll out its leading betting services to new customers in the region and bolster its position within the regulated gambling sector in Europe.</p>
<p>The expansion to France follows another important recent announcement of the Group. Earlier this month, Betsson confirmed it acquired a license in Serbia, allowing it to launch its games with the popular brand, Rizk.</p>

<p>Sabri Tekaya, Betsson France’s managing director, outlined that the entry in France represents an important moment for the company and comes after extensive preparation. “France is one of the largest European markets, and the Betsson Group is ambitious about engaging with all French players through its flagship brand,” added the managing director.</p>
