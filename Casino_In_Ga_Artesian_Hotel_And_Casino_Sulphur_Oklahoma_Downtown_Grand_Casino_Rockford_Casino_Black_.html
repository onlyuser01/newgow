    <h1>Casino In Ga Artesian Hotel And Casino Sulphur Oklahoma Downtown Grand Casino Rockford Casino Black</h1>

<p>The famous award-winning betting operator Luckbox has launched casino games on its own online betting platform. The new casino is already open to customers and includes a large variety of sports and esports betting offerings.</p>
<p>Luckbox Has Added Casino Games to Its Offerings</p>
<p>This move is an important step for Luckbox as it seeks to grow its business. By adding casino games to its platform and diversifying its gambling offerings, the company is set to benefit from the growth of the global betting and casino market.</p>
<p>Thomas Rosander, the chief executive officer of Luckbox, spoke extensively about the new casino games and the future of the company. He revealed that the operator’s main focus this year has been to recalibrate its next-gen wagering platform to set things up for future expansion.</p>
<p>Rosander explained that the online casino deployment “marks the most substantial and first visible milestone” to this end. He is delighted that this has been achieved before 2021 is even over and is optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>“The addition of casino brings Real Luck Group an expected near-term revenue stream in a vertical where I have had prior successes throughout my career, including my tenure as CEO of Dunder, which achieved annual revenues of €80 million in less than three years,” Rosander said.</p>
<p>The Company is Poised for Revenue Growth</p>
<p>Rosander continued that as of September 30, 2021, Real Luck Group, Luckbox’s parent company, had $16 million in cash and no debt whatsoever. With such a strong foundation, it is “well-capitalized” to continue evolving the Luckbox platform and continue driving organic player traffic through its programs.</p>
<p>According to the CEO, Luckbox is currently entering the revenue growth phase. He thanked the whole Luckbox team for achieving this major milestone within the timeline the company had promised to its stakeholders.</p>
<p>As for the growth phase, Rosander said that Luckbox will now fully commit to that. The company’s plans include scaling its player acquisition efforts across all of its verticals of sports and esports betting. Luckbox also thinks of further growing its newly-introduced casino games.</p>
<p>“We will continue to iteratively enhance our proprietary products as we strive towards providing a superior betting experience for the next generation of players,” he vowed. Rosander promised to keep investors updated about all major updates.</p>
<p>According to industry specialists, the global online casino market is expected to reach a total revenue of almost $135 billion by the end of the year. Analysts think that this number will continue soaring in the years to come, making Luckbox’s introduction of casino games a powerful move.</p>
<p>Luckbox’s growth was foreshadowed this year when the company sought to acquire new talent and increase its workforce.</p>
