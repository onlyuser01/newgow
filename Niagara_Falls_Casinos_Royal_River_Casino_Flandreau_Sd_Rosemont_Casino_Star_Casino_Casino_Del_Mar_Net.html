<p>Clients of Wind Creek Casino, Pennsylvania are now going to enjoy content by the digital entertainment leader NetEnt. With the recent deal, NetEnt continues its plan for expansion across the U.S.</p>
<p>NetEnt Launches Online Content for Wind Creek Casino</p>
<p>The digital entertainment company NetEnt continues its expansion on the fast-growing U.S. market. Today, September 22, the company announced the launch of leading portfolio of casino games for Wind Creek Casino in Pennsylvania. Wind Creek online players will now be able to access NetEnt’s leading casino content which includes a popular range of table games as well as the local top performer Divine Fortune.</p>
<p>Last year in July, NetEnt entered the online Pennsylvanian market. This happened right after the state established the regulated online casino market. With the most recent move, NetEnt undoubtedly is increasing its presence and market share in the Keystone State. Furthermore, according to the company, the market proved to be a major success with quarterly results showing consistent growth.</p>
<p>NetEnt Cements Its Presence in Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Commenting on the subject, the Chief Marketing Officer at Wind Creek Hospitality, Ken Rohman said that this is an exciting time for the company to add iGaming offering to Pennsylvania’s online market. He added that with the favorite casino games by NetEnt, Wind Creek will quickly gain market share. Rohman said that Wind Creek is looking forward to working with NetEnt’s knowledgeable team to build and deliver “first-rate online experience to our players”.</p>
<p>NetEnt VP of Commercial for the Americas, Brian Kraft deemed the partnership as a “major achievement”. He added: “The deal underlines our status as a go-to supplier in Pennsylvania both with established operators and emerging brands.” Furthermore, Kraft stressed that NetEnt’s content is performing strongly and it is highly popular. In conclusion, he said that as a result of the partnership, Wind Creek will undoubtedly make a big impact in the online casino market.</p>
<p>The Operator Continues to Expand across the U.S.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the recent partnership by NetEnt, we cannot miss saying that the company is focused on increasing its presence in the U.S. Only recently, the operator signed a groundbreaking partnership with BetMGM, aiming at rolling out its content in West Virginia. Last week, commenting on the subject, Kraft, deemed the partnership as “significant”. Furthermore, he added that the company continues its plan to expand across the U.S.</p>
<p>Looking back in July, NetEnt signed a couple of key partnerships. Following an agreement with Tipico, the operator launched its range of content in New Jersey. Another key partnership increased the online presence by NetEnt when the company signed an agreement with 888 casino. Focusing on the bigger picture, we can honestly say that for NetEnt the sky is the limit.</p>
