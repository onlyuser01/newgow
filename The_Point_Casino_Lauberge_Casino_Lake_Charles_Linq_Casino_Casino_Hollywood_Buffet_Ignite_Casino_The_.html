<p>Bellagio is one of the best casinos in Vegas for poker and one of the oldest modern properties to open doors on October 15, 1998. If poker is uppermost on your mind, you should definitely drop by Bellagio and enjoy the cavernous space hosting over 40 tables and attracting some of the best high-stakes action in town.</p>
<p>Yet, Bellagio will have a bit to offer to amateurs and professionals alike and its trademark Bobby’s Room is one of the best places high-stake players gather to play in town. Of course, the casino has much more to offer than just poker, but the property’s history with the game goes back years.</p>
<p>Bobby’s Room is actually named after the 1978 World Series of Poker Champion, Bobby Baldwin, who also served as president at Bellagio. The casino’s gaming space sprawls on 116,000 square feet.</p>

<p>Great prime ribs and great Metro Pizza slices affordable at $1/$2 with everything that a foodie desires. More tasty meals will complement your time at the low limit tables, which will usually be cheaper during the day. Don’t forget to visit Tupac Shakur’s memorial on your way to Ellis.</p>

<p>The Cosmopolitan Casino Las Vegas will make any food lover feel right at home, and add to your stay in Vegas as one of the best casinos to gamble in. Yet, if you experience a casino with your mind as well as with your stomach, The Cosmopolitan is the right venue for you.</p>
<p>From tasty tapas to beautiful burgers, the venue hosts a variety of great foods, including “Wicked Spoon,” “Rose. Rabbit. Lie” and “Eggslut” to name just a few. The Wicked Spoon buffet is an amazing place to crash in between gaming sessions, but you may have to prepare yourself for an upscale experience with The Cosmopolitan when it comes to your budget.</p>
<p>Cosmo actually relies more on the big socializing factor and you would probably find more pure, uncut gambling in other gaming floors, but make no mistake to miss out on Cosmo just yet. There are 110,000 square feet of gaming space to enjoy featuring all sorts of table games, including Blackjack, Roulette, Single Zero Roulette, Fortune Pai Gow Poker, and more.</p>
<p>The slot selection is pretty great as well, bringing you over 1,300 slots at price ranges from $0.01 to $500. In spite of its focus on socialization, Cosmo definitely has a dedicated gaming floor for even the fussiest of gamblers. Therefore, we have no doubt The Cosmopolitan is one of the best casinos in Vegas to stay and gamble in.</p>
