    <h1>7Bit Casino 50 Free Spins Casinos In Deadwood Sd Cannery Casino Hotel Sugar Sweeps Casino Stratosphe</h1>

<p>Dear darkmatt99,</p>
<p>No, you created 2 accounts on our website, and you submitted your complaints with another account where you filled in a different email address. Therefore, the notifications were sent to the wrong email address.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I fixed it, and from now on, you should receive all notifications to the correct address (kar<strong>*</strong>*1@hotmail.co.uk). So, please, check your email inbox, confirm your email, and after logging into your account with the correct email address, check the section "Complaints" with all your active complaints.</p>
<p>Since I know that you are in contact with a Jumpman representative via email, and no one from the casino has contacted me regarding your issue at all, I would like to ask you the same questions I asked in the open thread with Fluffy Wins Casino.</p>
<p>"When exactly was the disputed bonus offered to you or when exactly were you informed about this bonus offer, and how was the disputed bonus offered to you? Did you see it somewhere in your account, or did you receive an email with this bonus offer? Did you activate the bonus before your accounts were blocked? If you activated this bonus, did you play with the bonus funds, or were the accounts blocked earlier than you managed to? Did you meet the wagering requirements for this bonus, or were there bonus funds that needed to be wagered?</p>
<p>Please note that if you did not meet all the bonus/general bonus terms and conditions, and we are talking about only winnings from a bonus that were not wagered for the needed number of times, it is not possible to withdraw such funds, and it is not considered real money or withdrawable funds at all.</p>
<p>When exactly were your accounts blocked, and what exact bonus are we talking about? If there are any special terms and conditions for this bonus, are you please able to find this offer on the casino's website and send me a link to it or send me the terms and conditions for this bonus? If you are not sure about this information, can you please ask the Jumpman representative to provide you with it?</p>
<p>I see in the provided screenshots that you are still in contact with someone from Jumpman. Can you also ask them if their offer to provide you with an alternative bonus relates to all your blocked accounts falling under Jumpman? What alternative bonus did they offer you?</p>
<p>Also, the Jumpan representative asked you to provide them with some information and details - please, forward me the complete communication with them, not just screenshots with their replies."</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
