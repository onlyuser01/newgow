    <h1>Casino Hotels In Atlantic City Nj Casino Royale Lynd Fortune Casino Online Stream Casino Binion S Ho</h1>

<p>I want to add this text. It is copy paste from chat.</p>
<p>"Yes, i understand you position, but i want ask you</p>
<p>about Rule "Only one bonus can be active on your account at any given time. If there are several bonuses on one account, the bonuses are activated and wagered in turn"</p>
<p>In this case, you need to understand that these two rules contradict each other.</p>
<p>Corvo 12:47 PM</p>
<p>This rule is common to all bonuses, but in your situation, the bonus is composite, so there are no contradictions in this situation, Oleg.</p>
<p>Олег **** 12:48 PM</p>
<p>Why, then, when the first part is canceled, the second is not automatically canceled?</p>
<p>This confuses the players and results in situations like this</p>
<p>The mechanics of the site is made in such a way that I could not enter the welcome free spins until the welcome bonus was canceled.</p>
<p>I want to resolve this situation, i think i do not make something wrong, I hope, if you thing that i need to do some wager from deposit bonus add this wager and return my balance. i will make wager</p>
<p>Corvo 12:52 PM</p>
<p>Our website allows you to apply both parts of the bonus, without canceling any of them, you personally canceled part of the bonus. The second one was not canceled because you have completed its application.</p>
<p>When using a compound bonus (deposit bonus and free spins), if the user cancels the first part of the compound bonus (deposit bonus), all winnings received as a result of wagering free spins are canceled. They wrote off everything except the deposit amount.</p>
<p>May I help you with any others questions, Oleg?</p>
<p>Олег **** 12:59 PM</p>
<p>Okay, i want to ask you to resolve this situation, but you do not want to do it</p>
<p>Only by rule want to cut winnings. I udnerstand you, but i will write complaint on site Casino Guru to review this situation. I think you made unfair desition.</p>
<p>Corvo 01:02 PM</p>
<p>There is a set of rules on our website that sets out the procedure for applying bonuses, this paragraph of the rules was announced to you, you canceled the deposit part of the bonus, so the second part was debited from your account. It is possible to apply both of these bonuses on our website, there are no such difficulties. This decision was taken by you personally.</p>
<p>Олег **** 01:04 PM</p>
<p>No, i do not to this decision. I can not activated bonus</p>
<p>Because i entered cashier</p>
<p>and there i see active bonus</p>
<p>No any place where i can activate free spins</p>
<p>I am a simple player who does not know your site, I came to play and did not expect that I would be treated like this when I won</p>
<p>Corvo 01:08 PM</p>
<p>You entered the "cashier" section, and to conduct boos, you need a section to the left called "bonuses and promotions".</p>
<p>Олег **** 01:08 PM</p>
<p>Yes, i was there</p>
<p>And there i saw active bonus 325 eur, i can not see how to activate free spins</p>
<p>And only after i cancel Active Bonus, on this place i saw Free Spins</p>
<p>Corvo 01:11 PM</p>
<p>Tell me, please, did you take a screenshot of the screen at that moment, Oleg?</p>
<p>Are you still with me?</p>
<p>Олег **** 01:14 PM</p>

<p>Can I help you with something else?</p>
<p>Олег **** 01:19 PM</p>
