<p>GiG has signed a deal it announced earlier this month. The agreement will see the company make a foray into Switzerland</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), an iGaming company offering cloud-based products, announced that it had inked a Head of Terms agreement with a notable Swiss company. Now, the supplier confirmed that the deal has been signed.</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group Confirms Swiss Entry</p>
<p>As reported by GiG, the deal with “an established land-based and digital casino operator in Switzerland” has now been signed. Under the agreement with the still undisclosed company, GiG will provide its new partner with its award-winning player account management (PAM) platform.</p>
<p>The original announcement was made on January 10, when the company noted that the deal might not come into effect until Q1 2024. In its new announcement, GiG confirmed this projection.</p>
<p>The full agreement, GiG said, was signed for an initial period of five years. The agreement may be further extended depending on how the relationship between the supplier and the operator evolves.</p>
<p>For GiG, this is a very important deal as it will allow the world-class provider to make a foray into the tempting Swiss iGaming market. Online gambling in the country is still something fairly new, allowing GiG to be one of the local pioneers. In addition, it will help GiG expand its European footprint and improve its overall global presence.</p>
<p>GiG Is Happy to Expand Its Presence</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group’s chief executive officer, Richard Brown, commented on the agreement. He shared that he is very happy to pen this agreement with the Swiss company and added that he cannot wait to launch GiG’s products in the country. Brown added that GiG is very experienced in delivering proven solutions to online and retail operators and is looking forward to further expanding his company’s reputation.</p>
<p>Our considerable experience at delivering robust and innovative solutions to retail organisations in highly complex regulated business, continues to help our reputation as a provider of choice. Richard Brown, GiG, CEO</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group leverages an innovative and proprietary platform that makes it well-position to capitalize on the rapid growth of iGaming in Switzerland, the company noted. GiG also added that Swiss iGaming is projected to experience spectacular growth, with analysts predicting gross gaming revenue of €100 million for 2023 and €440 million by 2024.</p>
<p>In other news, GiG recently unveiled another Head of Terms agreement with a major European company. Once again, the supplier refrained from naming its new partner before the deal has been officialized. However, GiG teased that it is to supply this new and “well-known” partner with PAM and CSM solutions.</p>
