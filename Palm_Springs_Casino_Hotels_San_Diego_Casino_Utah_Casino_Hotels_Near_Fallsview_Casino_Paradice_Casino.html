<p>NOVOMATIC’s digital and interactive division is on the move once again. Greentube is expanding in Latin America with LatamWin, a prominent local operator. The new partnership will enable both partners to strengthen their operational reach in the region and Chile in particular.</p>
<p>For one, Greentube will have the opportunity to deliver on more of its acclaimed titles with a trusted and respected brand locally. LatamWin will boost its portfolio of products and engage with products through even better and more worthwhile titles.</p>
<p>Greentube Key Account &amp; Sales Manager for LatAm, Julia Schagerl, welcomed the opportunity and said that players will now have the opportunity to engage with the company’s outstanding games.</p>
<p>Schagerl confirmed that Greentube sees LatamWin as a strong regional partner and that the collaboration will help expand the company’s footprint across numerous "regulated market," and thus introduce more players to Greentube’s outstanding iGaming titles.</p>
<p>Moving forward, LatamWin players will have access to a select variety of games and iconic slot options, such as Book of Ra Deluxe, Lucky Lady’s Charm Deluxe, and Diamond Link: Mighty Elephant to name just a few. There will also be more titles by Greentube, and some of its latest releases, too.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will deploy many of its newer options, including Twin Spinner Book of Ra and Dragon Blitz. LatamWin is already present in many local and regulated gambling markets, which makes it a perfect partner for Greentube.</p>
<p>The partnership was similarly welcomed by LatamWin CEO Wilfred Adelsdorfer who said: "To be able to integrate their slot portfolio onto our platform is great for both ourselves and the players who will now be able to access their iconic slots."</p>
<p>Greentube has been growing its list of partners over the past months as reported extensively on Casino Guru News. The company forged a new content alliance in Ontario with none other than Entain. Similarly, the supplier drove forays into the European market once again with the help of Casino777.nl.</p>
<p>Greentube is unfaltering when it comes to expanding its reach. The company is servicing both its European and North American markets. In September, the company signed a deal with BetMGM for Michigan.</p>
