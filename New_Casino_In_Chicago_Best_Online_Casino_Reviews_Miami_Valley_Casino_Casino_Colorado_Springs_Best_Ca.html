<p>The leading gaming, entertainment and hospitality company in Australia, SkyCity Entertainment, announced upcoming changes to its senior-level team. Earlier this week, the company revealed that its current Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Ahearne, confirmed his intentions to step down from his role.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by SkyCity Entertainment, the CEO plans to end his tenure with the company effective from the end of March 2024. Once this happens, Ahearne anticipates returning to Europe with his family, the company revealed.</p>
<p>In light of the announcement, SkyCity Entertainment said that it has started the process of recruiting a new CEO. The company confirmed that it is currently reviewing options for internal as well as external candidates. At the current moment, SkyCity Entertainment did not disclose how long the process will take but confirmed that a relevant update will be published once it is complete.</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Julian Cook, SkyCity's Chair, explained that Ahearne's strategic guidance helped navigate the company through difficult periods. "This has included dealing with the significant fire at the New Zealand International Convention Center and rebuild, navigating the business through COVID-19 and the recovery and responding to regulatory matters relating to the SkyCity Adelaide business," he added.</p>
<p>Moreover, Cook said that Ahearne's guidance resulted in significant improvements and investments toward the compliance of SkyCity. "Michael has worked hard to set a strong platform for the business going forward and has been tireless in seeking to do the right thing for SkyCity," explained the company's Chair. Finally, he thanked Ahearne on behalf of the board and acknowledged his exceptional leadership, dedication and commitment that propelled the growth of SkyCity.</p>
<p>Ahearne first joined SkyCity Entertainment back in December 2017. At the time, he was appointed to the role of Group Chief Operating Officer. Then, in November 2020, Ahearne was appointed to the role of CEO which he continues to hold until this moment.</p>
<p>Currently, SkyCity is a renowned gaming, hospitality and entertainment business in Australia. The company has different businesses across the country with venues in Queenstown, Hamilton, Auckland and Adelaide and a growing team of more than 5,000 employees.</p>
<p>Currently, SkyCity's portfolio includes three luxury hotels, five world-class casinos, more than 50 bars and restaurants. As a leading gaming and entertainment operator, the company continuously invests in its properties, bringing new amenities that seek to elevate customer experiences.</p>
