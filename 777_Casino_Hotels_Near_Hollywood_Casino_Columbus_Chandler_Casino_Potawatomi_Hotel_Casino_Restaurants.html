<p>Crowder sustained a core injury against the Orlando Magic last weekend. At the time, the Bucks said Crowder had a groin injury. An MRI revealed something more serious with a left abductor and abdominal tear. Crowder consulted with a specialist, who confirmed that he needed immediate surgery.</p>
<p>Crowder, 33, underwent surgery on Tuesday. The Bucks indicated that he could return mid-January, but abdominal injuries are tricky.</p>
<p>Crowder averaged 8.1 points and 3.9 rebounds, mostly off the bench as a defensive specialist and spot-up 3-point shooter. He shot 53% from the floor, including 52% from 3-point range for the Bucks this season.</p>
<p>Next Man Up: MarJon Beauchamp, Andre Jackson Jr.</p>
<p>Crowder started two games but was primarily the sixth man on the Bucks and the anchor of their second unit. Before his injury, Crowder logged the third-most minutes on the Bucks behind stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard.</p>
<p>The Bucks already had a thin bench after they acquired Lillard in a three-team trade with the Portland Trail Blazers that also involved the Phoenix Suns. Losing Crowder for two months is a huge blow.</p>
<p>Sports can be brutal at times,” said Bucks head coach Adrian Griffin. “Jae came into training camp in phenomenal shape. Mind, body and spirit. He’s a tremendous piece of what we’re trying to do moving forward.”</p>
<p>Griffin will lean on backup forwards MarJon Beauchamp and rookie swingman Andre Jackson Jr. to fill in for Crowder.</p>
<p>It hurts, man,” Beauchamp said in an interview with The Athletic. “Jae was playing so well for us. I know he wanted this bad. He’d been working hard. He looked like the Jae Crowder that we know.”</p>
<p>The Bucks selected Beauchamp with a first-round pick in the 2022 NBA Draft. He averages 7.1 points and 2.6 rebounds off the bench this season.</p>
<p>Jackson, a second-round pick from the 2023 NBA Draft, won a NCAA championship with UConn in March. He averages 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game and has logged 13.5 minutes per game since Crowder went down.</p>
<p>Betting the Banged-Up Bucks</p>
<p>The Bucks (6-4) are currently in sixth place in the Eastern Conference playoff standings. Their starting five are still trying to develop chemistry after the Bucks pulled off a blockbuster trade for Lillard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the high-octane Indiana Pacers occupy first place in the Central Division with a 7-4 record. The Pacers average a league-best 126.5 points per game, nearly 10 more per game than the Bucks.</p>
<p>The Bucks are still the consensus favorite to win the Central Division at -250 odds. They’re seeking a sixth-straight division crown. The Cleveland Cavaliers are +240 odds to win the division, which they haven’t done since 2018 when LeBron James bolted in free agency to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>After their impressive start, the Pacers improved to +1300 odds to win the Central. The Chicago Bulls (4-7) are +5500 odds to win the Central Division, and the Detroit Pistons (2-10) are a long shot at +50000.</p>
<p>After their sluggish start, the Bucks are now third on DraftKings’ NBA futures board at +450 odds to win the championship. The new-look Boston Celtics are the consensus title favorite at +350 odds, followed by the defending champion Denver Nuggets at +400.</p>
<p>The Celtics (8-2) are the betting favorite to win the Eastern Conference at +155 odds, but the Bucks are a close second at +200. The Philadelphia 76ers are now +600 odds to win the conference. The 76ers are off to a torrid start at 8-2 after they traded unhappy shooting guard James Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers.</p>
<p>The Bucks are the worst betting team in the NBA this season. They have a 1-8-1 record against the point spread and have failed to live up to expectations after the Lillard trade.</p>
