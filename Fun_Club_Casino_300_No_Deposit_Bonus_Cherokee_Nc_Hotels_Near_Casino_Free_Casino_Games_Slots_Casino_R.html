<p>An official press release by payment provider Nuvei revealed that the company made a partnership contract with online gaming operator Kindred Group. Nuvei’s pay-in and payout options aim to boost player conversion through various quality-of-life changes and boost Kindred’s European growth.</p>
<p>Kindred Focuses on Its Core Markets</p>
<p>The new partnership does not come as a great surprise, considering Kindred’s long-term plans. The company, which primarily operates in Europe and Australia, recently announced that it targets an underlying EBITDA margin of 21-22% in 2025. The iGaming giant adjusted its estimates due to the stellar performance of its Netherlands division. North America also expects growth, but the company announced its intentions to focus on its core markets by improving the customer experience.</p>
<p>Kindred’s deal with Nuvei is a natural extension of these plans, as it will allow European players to focus more on gaming and less on navigating payment menus. Mickael Marceau, Kindred Group’s director of payment solutions, noted that the partnership had been an easy solution given Nuvei’s stellar reputation.</p>
<p>Nuvei has an excellent reputation in iGaming and a proven track record of delivering a seamless and secure payment experience in countries all over the globe. Mickael Marceau, director of payment solutions at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Marceau lauded the payment provider’s best-in-class card acceptance rates and added that maximizing player conversion was critical to the operator’s growth in key markets. The current agreement will introduce Nuvei’s payment options to Kindred’s European brands, and the two companies have revealed a mutual desire to expand their partnership outside the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Nuvei Is a Market Leader with a Proven Track Record</p>
<p>Partnering with a high-profile gambling operator like Kindred should be a substantial boon to Nuvei’s European market share. The payment provider has been expanding steadily since 2017, completing a major acquisition almost yearly. It operates in over 200 markets, supporting over 150 currencies and 570 alternative payment methods with a reputation for reliability and customer focus.</p>
<p>Kindred’s European clients will be able to benefit from market-leading payment acceptance and instant payout options while returning clients will have access to one-click deposits. Nuvei president Yuval Ziv also expressed optimism on the partnership’s prospects, adding that partnering with a leading operator like Kindred would help showcase the payment provider’s stellar services.</p>
<p>Kindred operates some of the most recognizable brands in European iGaming, so we’re proud to be supporting its growth across Europe. Yuval Ziv, president of Nuvei</p>
<p>Ziv also drew attention to Nuvei’s proven record of optimizing gaming operator conversion rates and accelerating revenue growth. He reiterated the company’s focus on guaranteeing a positive player experience via an industry-leading platform.</p>
<p>Players using one of Kindred’s many Europe-facing iGaming brands like Unibet, 32Red, Maria Casino, and Bingo.com should soon benefit from Nuvei’s extensive suite of payment options.</p>
