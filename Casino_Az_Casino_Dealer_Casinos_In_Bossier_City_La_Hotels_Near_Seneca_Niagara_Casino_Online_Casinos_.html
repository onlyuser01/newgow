<p>Indiana Casino and Sportsbook Revenues Rebound in July</p>

<p>Indiana’s casinos enjoyed a good start to the fiscal year in July.</p>

<p>According to the monthly data released by the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC) on Friday, the 12 state-licensed commercial casinos reported $201.2M in taxable adjusted gross receipts (AGR) for the month. That’s a 6.7% increase from June’s total of $188.7 million.</p>
<p>More importantly, it ended a three-month skid that saw revenues slide as economic conditions worsened. While the economy may be technically in a recession – based on the definition that the country’s gross domestic product shrank for the second quarter – other indicators like a good jobs market and falling gas prices help offset that.</p>
<p>There’s also some perspective that’s needed here. While there had been steady declines since March’s $219.2 million taxable AGR, those months still represented some of the highest totals in Indiana, dating back to at least 2017.</p>
<p>Since 2017, there have been 10 months where monthly taxable AGR broke $200 million. Seven of those have happened since April 2021. The other three occurred in March of 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>
<p>So Indiana’s casinos are still amid a strong run, and if certain economic factors continue to settle, they look poised to keep that going.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Stays No. 1</p>
<p>The state’s newest casino continues to be its top producer.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Northern Indiana reported a total win of $36.8 million, more than $6 million ahead of Horseshoe Indianapolis. After $1.5 million in free-play credits and other deductions were taken, the Gary land-based casino reported a taxable AGR of $35.3 million.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Hammond reported a taxable AGR of $26.5 million, with Horseshoe Indianapolis reporting $26.2 million after taking a 12% reduction from its win for its racino operations.</p>
<p>The best month for a Southern Indiana casino belonged to Caesars Southern Indiana, as the EBCI Holdings property reported a taxable AGR of $21.2 million.</p>
<p>With July’s start of the fiscal year, Indiana’s progressive tax rates on casino revenues reset. That’s why state tax receipts fell by more than half from June’s $65.7 million to $32.4 million in July, even though revenues increased monthly.</p>
<p>For most casinos in the state, the first $25 million in AGR is taxed at 15%. The rate increases to 20% for the next $25 million and 25% for the $25 million after that. AGR between $75 million and $150 million is taxed at 30%, with revenues between $150 million and $600 million taxed at 35%.</p>
<p>If any casino reports more than $600 million in AGR, those revenues get taxed at 40%.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Handle Drops, Revenue Rises</p>
<p>Moving to sports betting, Indiana continues to rank among the top states in the country in terms of handle.</p>
<p>The state’s sportsbooks reported a handle of $206.6 million for July. That’s down nearly $50 million from June’s total due to fewer sporting events during the month. However, it represents a $12.1 million increase from the July 2021 report.</p>
<p>The sportsbooks reported a better win rate even as the handle went down. July’s taxable AGR of $20.9 million was a 32.3% increase from the $15.8 million sportsbooks won in June.</p>
<p>Indiana also received nearly $500,000 more in taxes because of the better month for the books. According to the IGC, the sports betting tax generated nearly $2 million for the state.</p>
<p>FanDuel once again claimed the top spot among sportsbooks. Its $61.5 million handle for the month was $1.4 million better than DraftKings. The Flutter Entertainment brand reported gross revenues of $7.3 million, while DraftKings won $4.5 million.</p>
