    <h1>Maryland Live Casino Casinoes Dreams Curacao Resort Spa Casino Resorts Casino Casino Bingo Near Me M</h1>

<p>They emailed me demanding more information which I already gave them last year.</p>
<p>Here is the text from their email:</p>
<p>Hi Ahmad,</p>
<p>üëÄ Why have I received this email?</p>
<p>When players reach certain thresholds we are required by law to run a source of funds check, to verify how your deposits at MrQ are funded. We know it can seem intrusive, but you have our word; any information you send is treated as confidential and only accessed securely by our team of experts.</p>
<p>What do I do next?</p>
<p>As your account has reached one of these points, we've limited your depositing and your withdrawals are on hold whilst we ask you for the following:</p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Information about your income. Are you employed or self-employed? If so, let us know what you do for a living. If not, do you get your income from benefits or another source?</p>
<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Your most recent bank statement(s). We need to see your income being paid to you anddeposits to MrQ. If one statement includes both, you only need to send one. If it doesn't, you'll need to send us two.</p>
<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Proof of payment methods. You'll need to send a photo of all payment methods used in the last month. Remember to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First 6 and last 4 digits of the long number (use paper to cover up the rest!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Supporting documentation that verifies your income. This could be a payslip that relates to the income on your bank statement, a tax return, a bank statement showing funds or a benefit entitlement and award letter. We'll give you some guidance on what to send once we understand your income source.</p>
<p>Once ready, please send them to verification@mrq.com.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, this is all irrelevant. They have no right to withhold my winnings. I don‚Äôt care if they close my account but they must send me my ¬£800.</p>
<p>I have of course replied to them and explained that I chose not to send them source of funds in order to increase my monthly deposit limit of just ¬£300. Everything was agreed, I had long telephone discussions with them last year and I cooperated with them fully.</p>
<p>I think this email was triggered by an error when I tried to deposit more than I had because I typed numbers in the box even though I had selected ¬£50.</p>
<p>They usually reply within a day but they haven‚Äôt done that today and I just don‚Äôt see why my withdrawal is being withheld when I‚Äôve done nothing but deposit ¬£150 in total, play and win. I am contacting you early about this because of their lack of response, live chat and phone number. Their automatic responses claim they can take 5 working days to simply get a response!</p>
<p>I have told them everything they asked me and done everything they asked of me in the past. Nothing has changed so I see no reason for the delay in sending me my winnings.</p>
