<p>Pariplay, a powerful aggregator and a leading content supplier in the industry, joins forces with Gaming solutions developer and supplier, Greentube with a multi-jurisdictional agreement.</p>
<p>Greentube Extends Its Reach with Pariplay’s Fusion Platform</p>
<p>Pariplay, a leading aggregator and content supplier, has signed a multi-jurisdictional distribution agreement with Greentube, a leading supplier and developer of Gaming solutions for Internet and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Under the agreement between the two suppliers, content from Greentube, the NOVOMATIC Interactive division, will become available on Pariplay’s Fusion platform. Greentube’s reach is going to be extended, across regulated markets.</p>
<p>Fusion hosts one of the industry’s most comprehensive offerings and is licensed in over 16 controlled markets.</p>
<p>Pariplay Embraces Greentube’s Fan-Favorite Titles</p>
<p>Greentube’s diverse portfolio is available on the platforms of many leading operators. It is famous for its online adaptations of NOVOMATIC games. Its innovative, cutting-edge, in-house designed, and produced content has a strong presence across several markets.</p>
<p>The supplier’s portfolio of products includes popular fan-favorite titles such as Lucky Lady’s Charm deluxe and Sizzling Hot deluxe, along with Book of Ra deluxe. All of them will be available on Pariplay’s operator network.</p>
<p>Pariplay’s CCO Christine Lewis said that Greentube offers some of the most popular titles, loved by players worldwide, thus needs no introduction. She said that their slot portfolio would be the perfect addition to any operator’s platform.</p>
<p>Greentube CFO/CGO Michael Bauer stated that the company’s content has a global following. Its goal is to offer players from all over the world engaging and immersive content. Pariplay is a leader in the industry, and a powerful aggregator, offering top-notch content to a wide range of operators in the industry. Bauer said that joining forces with Pariplay makes complete sense, and the company is excited for the future of the collaboration.</p>
<p>Greentube recently made an ambitious move towards esports after a strong development in 2020. The company has acquired HERO, a block-chain-powered esports betting provider. HERO’s mission is to eliminate the middleman, allowing participants to create their contests and compete with each other.</p>
<p>Pariplay with a Strong Start This Year</p>
<p>Pariplay keeps its momentum. Fusion, the aggregator platform, recently welcomed Gamshy Games to add its state-of-the-art games to Pariplay’s portfolio. Some of the fan-favorite titles available on Pariplay’s platform include Jumping Sushi, Inferno, Western Barn, and Fruit Tribe.</p>
<p>Fusion gives its partners exposure to new audiences, offering them a gateway to new customers across multiple markets.</p>
<p>Pariplay recently appointed Jose Micallef as its new Business Development Director. With his industry know-how and extensive experience, Micallef is a valuable addition to the company’s team. Pariplay’s goal is to grow and expand its presence in the United States and other controlled markets.</p>
