<p>The UK Gambling Commission suspended from operation an online gambling operator that failed to integrate the safer gambling self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP, sending out a clear message that if operators do not abide by their responsible gambling obligations, it is determined to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>Operation Suspension, License under Review</p>
<p>The Commission said that as of November 3, 2022, LEBOM Limited, operating from lebom.app, has been suspended from offering its services to UK customers and will remain suspended until the regulator is satisfied with the operator’s full GAMSTOP integration.</p>
<p>Commenting on the enforcement action, executive director of Operations for the Gambling Commission, Kay Roberts, outlined that “it is simply unacceptable for any online operator to fail to integrate with the scheme” that “provides a crucial service for people who feel they are suffering from gambling harm.”</p>
<p>In 2020, integration with the self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP became mandatory for all online gambling operators, and they are also expected to refuse service to customers who have registered with the scheme.</p>
<p>The regulator noted to LEBOM that its obligation to treat customers fairly and fully informed of any developments which may impact them remains valid during the suspension and that the operator should continue to allow its customers access to their accounts and funds.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission also stated that it has launched a review of the operator’s license under section 116 of the Gambling Act 2005.</p>
<p>Commitment to Enforcing the Rules</p>
<p>When it comes to enforcing the rules and sanctioning operators which do not abide by their obligations, the Gambling Commission has already shown its mettle by issuing hefty fines to some of the largest operators such as Entain, Betway, Smarkets and others.</p>
<p>In September, Super Group’s flagship sports betting brand Betway was slapped with a £408,915 ($464,000) penalty for promoting its products to underage audiences by inserting its hyperlink logo on the children’s pages of West Ham United Football Club’s website.</p>
<p>A month before Betway, betting and gaming group Entain fell into the regulator’s crosshairs for failures in social responsibility obligations and anti-money laundering procedures. For these transgressions, Entain was ordered to pay a £17 million ($20.6 million) fine.</p>
<p>For similar social responsibility and AML breaches, the UK gambling watchdog sanctioned Smarkets a month earlier following a probe into the operator’s policies and practices. Smarkets was slapped with a £630,000 ($770,000) financial sanction, received a formal warning and would have to undergo an audit.</p>
