<p>Jud Hannigan has resigned as the chief executive officer at Allied Esports. The news came via a LinkedIn announcement shared on Hannigan’s profile in which he detailed his motivation behind the decision on Thursday. He originally stepped into the position back in February 2017 and presided over the group’s growth and expansion efforts in various entertainment verticals, including poker and esports. Before assuming the responsibility as CEO, Hannigan worked with Allied Esports in various positions as VP.</p>
<p>Seven-Year Journey, Seven Years of Transformative Changes</p>
<p>The man welcomed the opportunity to work with the company and he said that it was an important journey that continued for seven years in his case. Allied Esports started in China and gradually expanded to other countries and continents. During his time with the company, Allied Esports successfully listed on NASDAQ and launched a number of initiatives across numerous Web3 and esports initiatives.</p>
<p>“As an entrepreneur, it’s surreal taking an idea from a collection of PPT slides in my bedroom in Beijing to a bell ringing ceremony at the Nasdaq in Times Square,” the executive wrote reminiscently of those events. He offered his praise to the wonderful and talented people involved with the organization and said that the group would continue on its mission to create the most dynamic physical assets in esports, reminding of past achievements such as the esports truck, and more.</p>
<p>“I’ve been blessed to be able to steer this ship through both difficult and gratifying times and it’s been an honor building and leading this team, who I’m confident will continue to build on our success thus far,” Hannigan said. Allied Esports CEO Jud Hannigan</p>
<p>Hannigan is leaving the company after driving significant positive changes. The group’s most recent financial update with Q1 2022 EBITDA indicated strong momentum for the company. Allied Esports remains an important pivot in the esports industry, even though it has folded its ambitions for the poker vertical through the sale of the World Poker Tour in 2021.</p>
