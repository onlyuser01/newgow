    <h1>Hard Rock Hotel Casino Bristol Casinos In Florida Santa Fe Station Hotel Casino Chukchansi Gold Reso</h1>

<p>Posting the latest complaint update:</p>
<p>"We, at Gamdom, acknowledge how uncomfortable such situations can be, however, certain gaming patterns and amount thresholds trigger the application of Due Diligence measures.</p>
<p>According to the Anti Money Laundering and Anti Financial Crime Regulations, we are obliged to apply enhanced due diligence measures.</p>
<p>In particular, when the customer denies to provide adequate Source of Funds information, we are alerted for suspicious activity and possible fraudulent actions.</p>
<p>Upon receipt and review of proper documentation, we are in the unpleasant position to freeze their account and disable the withdrawal option, as international AML standards indicate."</p>
<p>I have asked the casino to provide more specific information, and I am still waiting to receive this. I understand that this is incredibly frustrating, but unfortunately these situations can take some time to bring to a conclusion. I will do my best to do so as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>I have no clue what seems to be the issue, the only part closest to the clear thing seems to be the casino got alerted about your account the moment you started asking about the purpose of the proof of income.</p>
<p>Uhm,..ok..</p>
<p>Does anyone else see something more specific?</p>
