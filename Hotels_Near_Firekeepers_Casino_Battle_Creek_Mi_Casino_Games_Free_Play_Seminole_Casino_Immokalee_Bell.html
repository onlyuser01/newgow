<p>Light &amp; Wonder has confirmed that the collaboration will help all parties involved to further boost their pull with iGaming audiences</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital provides a number of excellent proprietary games designed to engage consumers. Many of these games are based on classic film and TV titles, giving the studio а unique signature style. This uniqueness positions Atlantic Digital firmly in the industry and establishes it as a cutting-edge and leading supplier of gaming products.</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital to Leverage Playzido RGS to Reach More Audiences</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital will be boosted by the capabilities of Light &amp; Wonder-owned Playzido Remote Gaming Server (RGS) designed to simplify the delivery process across new partners and give the developer the opportunity to deploy its products quickly with target players.</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital will in fact now release a number of games that are developed directly through the Playzido RGS platform and thus help expedite the process, reduce costs, and drive synergies. All of this is part of OpenGaming’s ambitions to establish itself as the de facto go-to ecosystem for online and digital gaming.</p>
<p>Atlantic Digital managing director Sam Hobcraft has welcomed the opportunity and said that the collaboration was a “perfect storm” to drive the distribution of the studio’s excellent branded games. Hobcraft added:</p>
<p>We’re able to build games quickly and efficiently via the super-professional team at Playzido, but even more importantly, we’re now able to access the biggest operators on both sides of the Atlantic. Atlantic Digital managing director Sam Hobcraft</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Digital partnerships director Steve Mayes has welcome the opportunity on a similarly good note and said that he was excited to see the Atlantic Digital team join the OpenGaming platform and further benefit from the technological capabilities that Light &amp; Wonder had to provide through the use of the Playzido solution.</p>
<p>OpenGaming Certain to Contribute to Atlantic Digital’s Success</p>
<p>“Branded game creation is undeniably difficult to perfect, but we’re already delighted to see the level of skill, effort and attention that Atlantic Digital is investing into their games,” Mayes added. The executive was confident that the collaboration will further enable Atlantic Digital to pursue international growth.</p>
<p>As to OpenGaming, the platform already has more than 3,500 games that it builds either in-house or obtains from third parties. These games are then distributed among a fleet of operators that are licensed and operating in regulated gambling markets.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder has been actively expanding its reach with the OpenGaming platform over the past months, adding Blueprint Gaming and PlayJeux to the fold.</p>
