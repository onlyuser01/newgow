<p>Hsieh was honored Saturday night in the downtown Las Vegas casino district with a visual tribute displayed on the Fremont Street Experience lighted canopy.</p>
<p>The five-minute tribute featured images of Hsieh and the Eric Clapton song “Tears in Heaven.” The canopy covers a pedestrian mall on historic Fremont Street. The street, lined on both sides with casinos, is known as Glitter Gulch.</p>
<p>Casino owner Derek Stevens said Hsieh’s family asked him and his wife, Nicole, to take the lead in putting the tribute together, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Stevens owns three resorts on Fremont Street — the Golden Gate, D Las Vegas, and Circa Resort. Circa opened last month. It is the first hotel-casino built from the ground up in downtown Las Vegas in 40 years.</p>
<p>Stevens also is seen as helping transform the downtown area, which had fallen on hard times during the economic downturn more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Supporting this City and the people within it, Tony Hsieh changed the landscape of Downtown Las Vegas,” Stevens said in a tweet.</p>
<p>At news of Hsieh’s death, public officials and institutions throughout Southern Nevada responded on social media sites.</p>
<p>The Mob Museum in downtown Las Vegas tweeted that Hsieh “was a longtime friend and tremendous supporter of the Museum and incredibly passionate about the revitalization of downtown Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>“We will miss him dearly,” the museum tweeted.</p>
<p>Boost to Downtown Las Vegas</p>
<p>In his mid-20s, the Illinois-born Hsieh sold an online marketing firm, LinkExchange, to Microsoft for $265 million in stock.</p>
<p>In 1999, a decade after selling LinkExchange, the Harvard University graduate invested in a startup online shoe retailer, ShoeSite.com, later named Zappos, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Amazon bought Zappos in 2009 for $1.2 billion. Hsieh stayed on with the company, whose core values include “be humble” and “create fun and a little weirdness.”</p>
<p>For a while, Hsieh lived in Las Vegas in an Airstream trailer.</p>
<p>In 2013, Hsieh moved the Zappos headquarters into a building that once served as Las Vegas City Hall. During this period, Hsieh pledged $350 million to revitalize downtown Las Vegas, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Hsieh recently retired after 20 years at the company’s helm and purchased homes in the snow-skiing resort town of Park City, Utah.</p>
<p>House Fire</p>
<p>Hsieh died from injuries in a fire at a waterfront home on Nov. 18 in New London, Connecticut. He had been in Connecticut with his brother at the time, according to news accounts.</p>
<p>New London Fire Chief Thomas Curcio told The Day newspaper that firefighters arrived at the home around 3:30 am and discovered “somebody trapped in a portion of the house.” This person reportedly was suffering from possible burns and smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>The chief said firefighters “had to force entry. They removed the victim, started CPR, and transported him to the hospital.”</p>
<p>The victim, whose name was not immediately released, ultimately was taken to the Connecticut Burn Center in Bridgeport, about 65 miles from New London, according to news accounts.</p>
