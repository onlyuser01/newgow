<p>In a strategic move to enhance its sports wagering loyalty platform, Fanatics, the renowned sports merchandise company, is gearing up to introduce collectibles and trading cards to its rewards program.</p>
<p>Fanatics Eyes Collectibles Integration into FanCash Program</p>
<p>A representative from Fanatics confirmed in a statement for Casino.org that the company envisions incorporating collectibles into the FanCash sports betting rewards program in the future.</p>
<p>The company spokesperson mentioned that, although the collectibles launch is not something that will happen soon, Fanatics perceives numerous possibilities for FanCash to be integrated throughout the complete Fanatics ecosystem. The spokesperson conveyed that their objective involves persistently constructing a strong rewards program and advancing the overall fan experience.</p>
<p>Presently, the FanCash loyalty program enables sports betting enthusiasts to convert their accrued rewards into bonus bets or merchandise on a one-to-one basis. The program offers bettors a 1% reward for regular or straight wagers, 3% for parlays, and 5% for same-game parlays.</p>
<p>Fanatics’ Game-Changing Loyalty Strategy</p>
<p>In the world of sports betting, customer loyalty initiatives are widely appreciated, and Fanatics aims to stand out by leveraging its unique rewards offering. Consequently, Fanatics is exploring distinctive avenues such as allowing customers to redeem FanCash for clothing and merchandise, with the potential addition of collectibles.</p>
<p>Fanatics took a significant stride in this direction with its acquisition of Topps Sports &amp; Entertainment for $500 million in January 2022. This move highlighted the company’s commitment to being a major player in the sports card industry. The brand has also secured agreements with prominent leagues like Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA), along with partnerships with international sports teams and entertainment properties.</p>
<p>Fanatics Ramps Up Momentum After Sportsbook App Rollout</p>
<p>Fanatics plans to focus on collectibles following the launch of the Fanatics Sportsbook app in Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Tennessee. The app offers simplified signup, intuitive betting, and transparent withdrawals. It features live scores, odds, and various betting options, from moneyline to player props with a focus on enhanced user experience and leveraging FanCash – part of the loyalty program – for exclusive rewards.</p>
<p>Fanatics’ acquisition of PointsBet’s US operations and Banach Technology has improved the platform’s capabilities, including trading models and risk assessment tools. This move supports Fanatics’ potential entry into the New York market pending regulatory approval, while expansion into the Arizona market is also rumored as the state prepares to grant more sports betting licenses.</p>
