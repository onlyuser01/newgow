<p>With time about to expire and the Bears trailing by just a point, Chicago sent Parkey onto the field to hit a game-winning 43-yard field goal. He nailed it. But Philly coach Doug Pederson had called a timeout just before the snap to force a re-kick.</p>
<p>The second try hit the left upright, then fell to the crossbar, and ricocheted back onto the field. NBC announcer Cris Collinsworth called it a “double doink” that left the home crowd Chicagoans in disbelief.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers in Las Vegas had a different reaction.</p>
<p>When it hit the crossbar, we hit the jackpot,” South Point oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro told FOX Business’ Stuart Varney on Monday.</p>
<p>ESPN’s David Purdum reports that a Bears Super Bowl win was the worst-case scenario for multiple Las Vegas books. Chicago began the season as a 100/1 longshot. Only the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets had longer preseason title odds.</p>
<p>“I feel terrible,” Parkey said after the game. “I let the team down. That’s on me. I have to own it. I have to be a man. Unfortunately, that’s the way it went today.”</p>
<p>Dog Days of NFL</p>
<p>The Wild Card weekend of the NFL Playoffs was a clean sweep for the underdogs, as they went a perfect 4-0 against the spread. Underdogs also won three straight up, the exception being the Seattle Seahawks, which lost 24-22 at the Dallas Cowboys but were spotted 2.5 points.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Colts were given 1.5 points, but stomped the Houston Texans 21-7. The Los Angeles Chargers (+3) overcame the Baltimore Ravens in Maryland 23-17. The Eagles were 6.5-point dogs.</p>
<p>As for some notable bets, the William Hill sportsbook at Atlantic City’s Ocean Resort confirms it took a $300,000 wager on the Ravens. MGM said it took $365,000 at its Las Vegas books from one customer who put all the money on the Chargers. The wagers delivered a $100,000 profit.</p>
<p>Divisional Round Preview</p>
<p>Eight teams remain in the running for Super Bowl 53. Here are the Divisional Round odds as of Monday.</p>
<p>Saturday Colts vs. Kansas City Chiefs (-5.5) Cowboys vs. LA Rams (-7) Sunday Chargers vs. New England Patriots (-4) Eagles vs. New Orleans Saints (-8)</p>
<p>There are several substantial futures wagers that could pay out large returns. Purdum reports that the largest is a $20,000 bet on the Chargers made art 22/1 odds that would net $440,000. Another bettor risked $2,300 on the Cowboys at 75/1 odds that would return $172,500.</p>
<p>The Westgate SuperBook has the Saints the favorite to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy at 9/4, or implied odds of 30.77 percent. A $100 bet and a New Orleans title nets $225.</p>
<p>The Chiefs and Rams are next at 9/2, followed by the Patriots (5/1), Chargers (8/1), Cowboys and Colts (14/1), and defending champion Eagles the longshot of the eight at 16/1.</p>
<p>$100 on Philly and quarterback Nick Foles continuing his magical run and a back-to-back Super Bowl win would net $1,600.</p>
