    <h1>Foxwoods Casino Hotels Casinos In Gulfport Ms Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Blue Chip Casino L</h1>

<p>Hub88 has strengthened its variety of content and games by adding more titles from the prominent network of suppliers and studios</p>
<p>As a result, Hub88 will have access to a number of outstanding games that are designed to significantly strengthen its ability to deploy prime experiences for its partner operators.</p>
<p>Hub88 Gains Access to more Games with 1×2 Network</p>
<p>The games provided to Hub88 feature titles from established suppliers and studios, such as Iron Dog Studio, AD Lunam, 1x2gaming, and Prospect Gaming, all proprietary suppliers in the 1×2 Network.</p>
<p>Apart from these, there is also the aggregated content from other hand-picked suppliers that are also considered among the best in the industry. This means that Hub88’s partner operators will gain access to games such as Maverick, Megaways Jack, Rainin’ Money, and The Prospector Wild Series, among countless others.</p>
<p>Hub88 head Ollie Castleman has welcomed this opportunity and said that 1×2 Network was a supplier with an outstanding collection of opportunities to offer to partners. Castleman added:</p>
<p>We are extremely pleased with our commercial partnerships to date this year and collaborating with 1X2 Network is another feather in the cap as we push forward with our growth trajectory. Hub88 head Ollie Castleman</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 1×2 Network commercial director Chris Loftus argued that the company was determined to ensure that it continues to increase its global footprint and reach. One way to do this is through partnerships with established platform providers such as Hub88.</p>
<p>Presently, 1×2 Network has more than 120 studios and delivers them to partner operators all over the world. Hub88 offers an agile integration platform solution that leverages a single API to help build up online gaming operations.</p>
<p>Hub88 Makes It Easier for Partners to Thrive</p>
<p>Hub88 makes it easier to track performance and KPIs in real time and offers its solutions for partners on the go through an iOS and Android mobile app. Hub88 has been actively growing the number of content that it provides.</p>
<p>Recently, the company teamed up with SlotMarix and formed a new alliance together to help Hub88 clients gain access to the outstanding collection of titles featured in the aggregator. Other similar partnerships have been negotiated with the likes of Platipus and Lady Luck Games, among some of the prominent suppliers that have gone over single integrations rather than as part of bigger aggregators.</p>
