    <h1>Fairfield Inn Suites By Marriott Tampa Fairgrounds Casino Treasure Bay Casino And Hotel Motor City C</h1>

<p>I made more deposits at the casino and won a big win. I made a withdrawal request several times and the money was always returned to my game account. The message did not come as to why this was done. I asked in a chat and there was an answer when any document was missing. Eventually, when they accepted the documents (which I sent really a lot of), a message came out as to why I was using a VPN connection! Excuse me? I don't even know what it is.</p>
<p>Other casinos have never had any problems paying out winnings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only read after winning a casino guru review. I wouldnâ€™t have deposited at this casino if I had known about the bad reputation. I have all the documents and email messages / chat conversations on file. What can be done about it?</p>
<p>regards</p>
