    <h1>Casino Adrenaline Casino Map Casino Sault Ste Marie Mi Sunset Station Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Fand</h1>

<p>Dear Epedro46,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent a request for the self-exclusion? My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in that request for how long you wish your account to be suspended and the reason why?</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gambling section on the website and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"EXCLUDE YOURSELF FROM GAMBLING</p>
<p>In the event of risky gaming behaviour, you can temporarily or permanently exclude yourself from participating in games of chance via our website. You can find this option under 'Limits'.</p>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>This option allows you to exclude yourself from our website for a limited time. You can choose a break from 1 day to 6 weeks. During this break you cannot log in to our website. Note: this also means that you can no longer access your account.</p>
<p>Self-exclusion</p>
<p>With this option you can exclude yourself for a longer period. You can choose a self-exclusion of at least 30 days. The maximum is 'forever'. During this self-exclusion you will not be able to log in to our website. Note: this also means that you can no longer access your account.</p>
<p>If you change your mind or want to change something during a break or self-exclusion, you should contact our customer service."</p>
<p>Is this klantenservice@fairplaycasino.nl the email address that you have sent your email to?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
