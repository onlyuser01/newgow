<p>Swiss Casinos Group is expanding its online products range with the arrival of Playtech’s iPoker Network.</p>
<p>Swiss Casinos Welcome Playtech’s iPoker Network</p>
<p>Playtech continues to expand and reach out to new clients and now signing a fresh partnership: the gaming software development company founded in 1999 and listed on the London Stock Exchange is teaming up Swiss Casinos Group for an access to its online poker software and iPoker Network.</p>
<p>That’s exciting news, says Shimon Akad, Playtech’s chief operating officer who commented: “Having invested heavily in our new Poker web client, in addition to our native Poker app and popular downloadable desktop Poker Client, we can offer operators access to an exceptionally flexible platform as well as an ever-growing network.”</p>
<p>The executive said it was a pleasure to welcome Swiss Casinos to the iPoker Network family, expanding on other partnerships that were established this year. Playtech sealed an esports partnership with Golden Matrix, a key deal that aims to grow its esports and betting presence internationally.</p>
<p>In addition, the stability of the network enables Playtech to supply a large choice of partners; however large the player base is and whatever the main business or marketing approach. It also provides considerable adaptability and innovation for operators, while ensuring a safe and friendly environment for gamers. The present partnership builds on an earlier agreement established back in 2019.</p>
<p>Swiss Casinos Launches Country’s First Online Poker Portfolio</p>
<p>In the meantime, Swiss Casinos, operating in Pfäffikon, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen and Zürich, now offers the very first Swiss online casino. This new initiative is an answer to the strong for innovating gaming products since the new Gambling Act came into effect in 2019 in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Registered players can choose from some of the most popular and challenging variants of poker, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha and 6 Plus Hold’em. In addition to cash games, tournaments and Sit &amp; Go’s are also available. The focus is on a safe gaming environment and recreational gaming that provides the opportunity to both amateur and experienced players to get together.</p>
<p>Marc Baumann, chief executive at Swiss Casinos stated: “Launching our online casino offering in partnership with Playtech over the past twelve months has been incredibly rewarding, and we are excited to be bringing the iPoker.com network to Switzerland for the first time.”</p>
<p>Besides, Playtech declared wanting to transfer its tax residency at the beginning of next year, from the Isle of Man to the UK , making it possible to host shareholders meetings in the UK. That would for sure permit a wider involvement from shareholders.</p>
<p>As part of its partnership initiatives, Playtech also recently extended its agreement with TruNarrative for Affordability UK, in order to ensure customer protection and comply with the new affordability standards like establishing a consumer-friendly iGaming and betting experience.</p>
