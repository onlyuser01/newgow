<p>US nation’s first streaming video network serving sports betting audiences SportsGrid announced today the NewsWire weekday news program is set to debut streaming live on April 12, 2022.</p>
<p>‘Perspective and Authority’</p>
<p>The NewsWire, a sixty-minute live sports wagering news program, will be presented by long-time broadcast veteran and journalist Craig Mish, featuring the most important headlines, events, and storylines of the day with comprehensive reporting on all sports betting-related matters.</p>
<p>“NewsWire is based on two tenets —perspective and authority. Both tenets are supported by the strategic content alliance between SportsGrid, The Sporting News, and Legal Sports Report delivering the relevant daily news with insightful and authentic analysis to the sports betting audience base across the nation.” Jason Sukhraj, General Manager, Audience and Syndication, SportsGrid</p>
<p>The program will be supported by the editorial teams of The Sporting News, a dynamic digital publisher with over 35 million monthly users, and Legal Sports Report, a media focusing on the legal aspect of the online sports wagering industry, providing it with actionable insights to further boost the program’s offering of sports betting legislation, technology, and operators news.</p>
<p>On behalf of The Sporting News, Benson Taylor, global editor-in-chief at the media, expressed his delight to partner with SportsGrid and launch the NewsWire, stressing The Sporting News’ “strong heritage of going beyond the score to deliver insight, analysis, and content” related to the biggest sporting events.</p>
<p>“We’re excited for the opportunity for our award-winning journalists to offer their perspective to the NewsWire audience, and to be a part of SportsGrid’s broad multimedia platforms,” he concluded.</p>
<p>The collaborative initiative that will bring together the strategy, reporting and editorial resources of The Sporting News and Legal Sports Report under the SportsGrid strategic content alliance will help develop a reputable world-class editorial program, utilizing new ways to create, present and distribute video content, powered by digital technologies.</p>
<p>Valuable Sports Gambling Industry Insight</p>
<p>Dustin Gouker, a publisher for Legal Sports Report, outlined that the NewsWire’s focus would be on the “business of sports betting in North America,” as journalists of LSR would “provide viewers with valuable insight into the ins and outs of the sports gambling industry as it expands across the US and Canada.”</p>
<p>The multimedia content and technology company SportsGrid, including SportsGrid Streaming Video Network, SportsGrid Radio, SportsGrid.com, DailyRoto, and SportsGrid Studios, is providing digital innovative solutions, leveraging effective collaboration and coordination of workflow to saturate news with deep editorial insights, analysis and perspective.</p>
<p>SportsGrid intelligence and data are featured via Sportradar’s real-time data feeds and content solutions via seamless integration with the leading data technology supplier.</p>
