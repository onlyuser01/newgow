<p>Esports betting platform and media company Rivalry announced today a new addition to its Board of Directors, Kirstine Stewart, to assist the company’s ambitions to grow into international markets.</p>
<p>Key Addition to the Board</p>
<p>The election of Stewart to the Board of Directors of Rivalry was approved by the company’s shareholders at their most recent meeting, alongside other key decisions to affirm Rivalry’s resolve to establish a presence in regulated online sports betting. One such decision was the election of former president and CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Stephen Rigby, to the Board.</p>
<p>A leading media and technology executive with extensive global experience, Stewart, whose career started in television broadcasting at top cable channels such as Hallmark, HGTV, The Food Network and National Geographic, will leverage her knowledge and experience to help propel the company to international growth.</p>
<p>With a series of executive roles both in Canada and the US, including head of Canada’s national broadcaster CBS and VP of North American Media at Twitter, Stewart boasts a wealth of experience driving partnerships in news, entertainment, government and sports.</p>
<p>Kirstine’s background reads like the DNA of Rivalry. She has extensive experience in media, specifically at Twitter, which innovated what content and brands look like on the internet. Then going to the WEF as Head of the Future of Media is a caliber of global experience that aligns with our ambitious expansion plans at Rivalry.” Steven Salz, Co-Founder and CEO, Rivalry</p>
<p>Stewart’s most recent role as Head of the Future of Media at the World Economic Forum allowed her to establish business contacts with executives and chairs of companies like Facebook, Google, Bytedance and NBCU. Stewart currently serves at an innovative digital rights company Pex as CRO.</p>
<p>“I’m confident this significant knowledge and category understanding will enable us to further execute on our vision to provide the safest and most engaging sports betting and sports media experience in the world for the next generation of fans.” Steven Salz, Co-Founder and CEO, Rivalry</p>
<p>Excited to Help the Team</p>
<p>Stewart, who also has held positions on the boards of public, private and nonprofit organizations like theScore, WOW and DMZ, expressed her excitement at the opportunity to join the board of “such an innovative team in the sports betting industry.” She asserted, “Rivalry’s media and betting strategy is creating something unique for the next generation of sports bettors, and I am excited to see us continue to grow and evolve alongside this fast-paced industry. I can’t wait to get to work collaborating with such a dynamic, well-informed and motivated team.”</p>
