    <h1>Nugget Casino Sparks Nv Hollywood Casino App Caesers Casino Wind Creek Casino Md Live Casino BetMGM</h1>

<p>BetMGM, a gambling company describing itself as “the king of online sportsbooks” has extended its partnership with the National Football League (NFL). The multi-year agreement will set the operator as the League’s official sports betting partner in Canada.</p>
<p>BetMGM to Work with the NFL in Canada</p>
<p>Choosing BetMGM as NFL’s partner in Canada is a sensible choice considering that the operator was one of the first to be approved by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario when iGaming went live in the province. The company is furthermore lauded as one of the most influential operators in North America.</p>
<p>As a partner of the NFL in Canada, BetMGM will be able to use official NFL branding to promote its products in the country. In addition, the operator will be allowed to promote its offerings locally through NFL’s official digital media platforms. Lastly, the agreement will allow BetMGM to offer special NFL offers and engage its fans with exclusive promotions.</p>
<p>The deal with the National Football League in Canada expands BetMGM’s already significant presence. The betting company is also one of the League’s partners in the USA. Because of that, since 2021, BetMGM has been able to run in-game TV spots throughout the NFL season.</p>
<p>NFL Is Glad to Have Chosen BetMGM</p>
<p>Gavin Kemp, NFL Canada’s senior director of corporate partnerships, is aware of the quality of BetMGM’s betting products. He said that his team is glad to be working with BetMGM in Canada and have the operator as the League’s official sportsbook partner.</p>
<p>Kemp noted that people love BetMGM’s unique gaming platform and said he is sure that the company will quickly conquer the emerging Canadian online market. He concluded that the operator will enhance the experience of sports bettors in “new and innovative ways.”</p>
<p>Adam Greenblatt, chief executive officer of BetMGM, also shared his thoughts. According to him, the expansion of the company’s partnership with NFL into Canada is an important move. He elaborated that this deal will “set the stage for amazing opportunities ahead of the upcoming football season.”</p>
<p>We’re already seeing great interest from our Ontario customers and this collaboration truly elevates the BetMGM experience. Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>BetMGM continues to grow and create more value for its customers. In late June, the company teamed up with the Tom Joyner Foundation to introduce special executive series. Earlier, BetMGM secured a new batch of games from EveryMatrix, a renowned iGaming software provider.</p>
