<p>Land-based casino operator in the UK Rank Group announced a new partnership with GamCare that would see safer gambling and social responsibility training delivered to over 1,400 team members.</p>
<p>‘Safer Gambling is a Strategic Pillar’</p>
<p>The agreement of Rank Group, operator of Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo venues in the UK, with the country’s leading provider of information, advice, and support for problem gamblers, GamCare, will kick off later in May and will run through November, offering 150 days of training.</p>
<p>Delighted at the “significant scale” of the partnership with GamCare, Rank Group’s chief executive officer John O’Reilly outlined the “relentless commitment” of Rank Group to improve its interaction with customers and provide them with “the safest and best experience.”</p>
<p>“Safer gambling is a strategic pillar of the Rank Group and it requires investment, expertise and a deepening of all our knowledge,” O’Reilly continued, focusing on GamCare’s expertise in optimizing “safer gambling and social responsibility interactions.”</p>
<p>“… I am certain that our colleagues will benefit enormously from their expertise which will, in turn, give a much improved service to our customers.” John O’Reilly, CEO, Rank Group</p>
<p>Expanding GamCare Partnership</p>
<p>A long-standing partner with GamCare, the new partnership with Rank Group will continue on the path established in the past 18 months during which Rank Group employees working in Customer Service, digital and land-based Mecca Bingo units have been receiving responsible gambling training and education.</p>
<p>Pleased to be extending the partnership with Rank and “deliver safer gambling training across all their brands,” GamCare CEO Anna Hemmings outlined the importance of investing in “people’s skills and knowledge” to improve the level of customer interaction responsible gambling-wise and “help reduce the risk of gambling harms.”</p>
<p>“Our training incorporates the experience of our service users, the huge level of collected evidence and industry research across numerous fields and GamCare’s many years of experience working across the sector.” Anna Hemmings, CEO, GamCare</p>
<p>Intermediate and Advanced Level Courses</p>
<p>In addition, GamCare will deliver a one-day intermediate-level course on social responsibility and interaction to 950 people from various Rank Group business functions working at Grosvenor Casinos, Mecca Bingo clubs, Rank Interactive, and others.</p>
<p>Seeking to strike a balance between compliance and customer-focused engagement, the course will utilize case studies for team members in client-facing functions to train them on how to interact with customers in a safer and responsible gambling way.</p>
<p>The expanded training program provided by GamCare will also include an advanced level course, a two-day program aimed at supervisory and managerial level personnel, that will allow a further 500 team members to benefit and improve their knowledge, skills, and capabilities.</p>
<p>Participants in the advanced level course will also learn motivational interviewing skills to boost their level of effectiveness when communicating with high-risk customers.</p>
