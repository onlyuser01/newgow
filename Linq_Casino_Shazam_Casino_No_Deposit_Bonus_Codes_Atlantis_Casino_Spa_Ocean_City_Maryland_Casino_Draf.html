<p>888, the company that acquired William Hill earlier this year, provided insights into its efforts to promote responsible gambling across its retail business during the ongoing Safer Gambling Week. According to the company, the initiative is a great opportunity to reflect on its progress.</p>
<p>Mark McCaffrey, the company’s head of compliance policy, retail &amp; sportsbook, highlighted the efforts of the company’s shop employees who have a great relationship with their customers. According to McCaffrey, 888’s genuine care for the customers provides it with a significant advantage when it comes to safer gambling.</p>
<p>McCaffrey also noted that 888 has introduced a number of new tools and changes that help them shield consumers from harm. This includes the introduction of exception reporting that helps 888 employees identify at-risk players based on changes in their behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, 888 introduced a new affordability approach to prompt conversation at key points in the customer journey. Furthermore, the company made improvements to the system its workers use to record customer interactions and decisions, providing a more holistic view of their time with the company.</p>

<p>In addition to innovating through the use of cutting-edge technology, 888 also recently teamed up with BetKnowMore to offer a training program for its cluster operations managers and shop teams. The training will enhance the managers’ and team’s skills even further, McCaffrey said.</p>
