<p>Estimated 11 casino properties will be available by 2023 in Primorye Gambling Zone, head of Department of Tourism and vice governor Konstantin Shestakov confirmed.</p>
<p>Primorye Gambling Zone Right on Schedule</p>
<p>The anticipated Primorye Gambling Zone in Russia will host at least 11 casinos with the properties being finalized by 2023, Konstantin Shestakov, regional vice governor said during a recent visit to the future gaming hub.</p>
<p>So far, seven companies have expressed interest in investing a total of $1.2 billion. Participants from Cambodia, Russia, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Russia are all among the investors.</p>
<p>Speaking from Primorye, Mr. Shestakov explained that the entertainment complexes were in the process of finalization. An investor from Cambodia was also in the process of completing an 11-story hotel &amp; casino.</p>
<p>First Properties Opening and Scheduled</p>
<p>Shambhala CJSC, a Russian-headquartered company, on the other hand, was preparing for a soft launch of its own casino at some point in March 2020, Mr. Shestakov added. Meanwhile, the Diamond Fortune Casino should arrive by September 2020.</p>
<p>All work on site in the IRC is supervised by Primorsky Krai Development Corporation JSC, established to specifically oversee the sprawl of the gaming zone. In an official statement, the Corporation emphasized on the progress that had been made.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there has been a spike in interest to build new casinos in the region, Primorsky Krai specified. The company further confirmed that there were enough spots to accommodate new arrivals, and that partnerships with global gaming entertainment leaders have been established.</p>
<p>Primorsky already has the Tigre de Cristal, the first tentative property which opened back in 2015 and has been drawing a respectable crowd to the site.</p>
<p>A Boost for Tourism</p>
<p>Speaking to a media outlet, Mr. Shestakov, also head of the Department of Tourism, noted that the arrival of so many new properties would be linked to growing numbers for tourism. In turn, this would necessitate diversifying the region’s tourism offer and better infrastructure.</p>
<p>Mr. Shestakov specifically pointed out that Japanese tourist are one of the key target groups, and that the Department was working with Japanese counterpart to promote the zone more efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Department has struck deals with Costa Rica and Royal Caribbean, so estimated 20 cruise ships will dock in Vladivostok in 2019 and their number should remain steady throughout 2020 and up to the official opening of the zone.</p>
<p>Crimea and Russia’s Latest Appetites</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia has its sights firmly on the South where Crimea will be transformed into another gaming hub. So far, there are four zones across the Russian Federation where gambling is legalized, to name Altai, Krasnodar, Kaliningrad and Primorsky with Crimea facing some serious obstacles.</p>
<p>After the unlawful annexation of Crimea in 2014, the international community has been unanimous in condemning the move. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin is now hopeful to transform Crimea into a holiday and gambling hub.</p>
<p>It has been 5 years since the annexation, and Crimea’s economic status has been morose. Russia has even levied accusations against Ukraine for failing to provide financial support for the peninsula.</p>
<p>Far from the political bickering, however, Primorye Gambling Zone is quickly moving to a complete launch. The Tigre de Cristal will soon not be the only casino.</p>
