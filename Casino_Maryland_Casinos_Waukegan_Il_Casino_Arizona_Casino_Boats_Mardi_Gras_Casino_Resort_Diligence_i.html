<p>Smart Gaming, the operator that recently received a license in the Netherlands, announced a new partnership with the leading regulatory and operational compliance company, Diligence in Gaming.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the new deal announced Tuesday, Diligence in Gaming will support Smart Gaming’s entry into the Dutch regulated gambling market and its new live casino brand betnation.nl. But this is not the first time the duo joined forces. Previously, Diligence in Gaming inked a partnership with Smart Gaming to help the operator gain a license in the Netherlands. The lengthy process has taken six months but in the end, last month, Smart Gaming received its license to operate in the Netherlands. Now, the terms of the new deal will see Diligence in Gaming continue to support betnation.nl in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Dutch Market Requires a Local Specialist</p>
<p>Mike de Graaff, Diligence in Gaming’s Regional Compliance Manager for the Netherlands, revealed that the market in the country has specific compliance requirements. He explained that a specialist with local experience and expertise is needed to ensure the compliance of operators in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>“Smart Gaming worked with us for six months before receiving their license, to ensure all was ready for the go live. Excellent planning has paid off, and we look forward to working with them in the future.” Mike de Graaff, Regional Compliance Manager, NL at Diligence in Gaming</p>
<p>Graaff pointed out that the Dutch gambling regulator, the KSA, will test operators if they comply with the local regulations, which is why it is vital to ensure compliance before going live. Diligence in Gaming’s boss acknowledged that the company collaborated with Smart Gaming in the last six months to receive its license and ensure compliance when going live. In conclusion, Graaff said that the company is looking forward to collaborating with the operator further.</p>
<p>“Diligence in Gaming, led in the Dutch market by Mike de Graaff, is the only provider of these vital services in the Netherlands.” Robert Schouten, CEO at Smart Gaming</p>
<p>Robert Schouten, Smart Gaming’s CEO, added that Diligence in Gaming is the only company with such experience offering services in the Netherlands. He acknowledged that Diligence in Gaming and Graaff helped Smart Gaming significantly during the application process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Schouten pointed out that the company will continue to collaborate with Diligence in Gaming to ensure “the highest level of compliance and maintain a safe environment for our players.” Last but not least, Smart Gaming’s CEO said that Diligence in Gaming and Graaff helped train the company’s senior management, compliance and customer service team and the results are exceptional.</p>
