    <h1>Dreams Curacao Resort Spa And Casino Reno Casino Hotel Casino In Southern California Golden Hearts C</h1>

<p>After inking a milestone content deal with bet365 in mid-May and announcing it will power Betway with Live Blackjack, popular iGaming content supplier Pragmatic Play has released Queen of Gods, an Ancient Egypt-themed video slots game. The new slot comes with variable volatility and plenty of free spins, multiplier wilds, and a Mystery Option.</p>
<p>Queen of Gods Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Paylines: 10</p>
<p>RTP: 96.36% | 95.26% | 94.32%</p>
<p>Hit Freq: 1 in 120</p>
<p>Max Win: 1,839x</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max Bet: 0.10/100</p>
<p>The game has the standard 5×3 reel grid design in place and it is loaded with specific Ancient Egypt deities that represent the high-paying symbols in the game. The list includes gods like Anubis, the protector of graves, Horus, the god of kingship and the sky, and Sebek, the crocodile god. Queen Cleopatra is the highest-paying symbol. The game also features wild symbols, helping players create matching combos on the ten available pay lines in order to trigger higher wins. To score a win during the base game, players must land at least five matching symbols on a single payline for a payout of 2x-5x the bet for the royals and 10x-20x the stake for premium game symbols. The wild symbols can randomly land on reels two to four and they can complete a winning line by replacing any other symbol with the exception of scatters.</p>
<p>The game has a bright design, with the active game area in the middle, right in between Anubis’s statues, the beaming rays of sun, and the beautiful columns with Egyptian patterns. The slot’s soundtrack has also been chosen carefully, adding more to the mystical atmosphere. Pragmatic Play’s chief business development officer Yossi Barzely believes the choice of theme and the added bonus round with high-paying symbols should attract “both new and existing Pragmatic Play enthusiasts.”</p>
<p>Free Spins Round &amp; Mystery Option</p>
<p>To trigger the Free Spins round, a player must land a minimum of three scatters during the base game. Here, players receive four different spin alternatives as well as different wild multipliers. As a rule of thumb, the more spins a player chooses, the lower the wild multiplier will be. Players also have the alternative of letting the Egyptian gods pick their luck through the mystery option. This choice triggers a random number of spins and multiplier wilds to be played during the free spins bonus round.</p>
<p>During the same free spins bonus round, the game activates the special reels that can exclusively host the four highest-paying symbols and the wilds selected by players before the start of the round. As expected, this boosts the big-win potential of the game up to 1,823x the bet.</p>
<p>Queen of Gods joins other fresh titles that the supplier has added to its portfolio of 200+ games in the last few days, including Wild West Gold Megaways, Fortune of Giza, and Zombie Carnival.</p>
