<p>Top Favorites to Win the 2023 Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum</p>
<p>This race isn‚Äôt a part of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series calendar, meaning that it‚Äôs not essential for the drivers to do well in it. Still, the 2023 Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum serves as a dress rehearsal for the new season, giving every driver an opportunity to test their car and strategy before the real competition begins.</p>
<p>The exhibition race has always been a favorite of both fans and drivers. In the past, it used to be driven in Daytona on a road course with 35 laps. Last year, however, a new chapter in the history of Busch Light Clash started ‚Äì the event got its new home.</p>
<p>The last year‚Äôs Busch Light Clash was the first one to take place at The Coliseum (oval). The race now consists of 150 laps, each of which is a quarter of a mile in length. The new environment obviously suited Joey Logano, who won the inaugural event and then went on to become the 2022 NASCAR champion.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, it‚Äôs no surprise that Logano is one of the top favorites to win the 2023 exhibition race. What is kind of surprising is that he‚Äôs not the No. 1 favorite. Instead, he‚Äôs sitting in third place behind Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre wondering about what‚Äôs behind this, it‚Äôs that these two drivers have championship ambitions in 2023. Both feel as if they ended up without the trophy by accident last year, which is why they‚Äôre planning to take the 2023 campaign super-seriously from the very start. And that implies that they‚Äôre gonna do their best on Sunday at The Coliseum.</p>
<p>Our Prediction for the 2023 Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum</p>
<p>Considering that this is the first NASCAR race of 2023, we suspect a surprise might happen, albeit not a major one. We think none of the top three candidates will win this race, but we do think the man sitting in the No. 4 spot on the list of favorites might do it.</p>
<p>The man in question is Kyle Busch, a true veteran who‚Äôs changed his allegiance to Richard Childress Racing (RCR) after spending 18 seasons as a member of the Joe Gibbs Racing team. He swapped his Toyota for a Chevy, which he‚Äôll debut on the racetrack this coming Sunday. We think it‚Äôs going to be a debut to remember.</p>
<p>Pick: Kyle Busch to win the 2023 Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum</p>
