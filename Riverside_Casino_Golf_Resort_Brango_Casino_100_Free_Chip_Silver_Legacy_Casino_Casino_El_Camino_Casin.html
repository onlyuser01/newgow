<p>The 26-year-old casino employee was ordered to pay nearly $85,000 in restitution and spend four months in prison</p>
<p>Crimes related to casinos are rarely difficult to solve. Extensive monitoring of the casino floors and financial audits help prevent attempts for thefts or embezzlement. Despite the efforts of gambling operators, some perpetrators still try to steal from venues, only to get caught sooner or later.</p>
<p>In one such case, a former casino employee was sentenced to prison and restitution. The case involves Jordan Lewis Cook, a 26-year-old from Hopkins who was employed by Gun Lake Casino, a premier gaming and entertainment venue located in Wayland, Michigan. The man was accused of stealing more than $100,000 while he was employed by the casino.</p>
<p>Gun Lake Casino is currently owned and operated by the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, commonly referred to as the Gun Lake Tribe. According to the prosecution, Cook stole more than $100,000 between September 2021 and November 2022. During that time, he took large sums of cash from the casino’s cash-out kiosks.</p>
<p>Cook was tasked with fixing jammed machines across the casino floor. However, as seen in video surveillance, upon fixing the machines, he pocketed substantial sums in cash. Besides evidence in the form of video surveillance, the prosecution uncovered that between September 2021 and November 2022, Cook’s bank account grew with a significant number of cash deposits.</p>
<p>Mark Totten, the US Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, announced the penalty Cook received for the aforementioned crime, as confirmed by a report from Fox17 West Michigan. The 26-year-old was sentenced to four months of imprisonment followed by a two-year supervised release. Moreover, Cook was ordered to pay some $84,564 in restitution.</p>
<p>The Tribe Collaborates with Law Enforcement to Resolve and Prevent Crimes</p>
<p>Speaking on the topic, Totten said that the recent case reaffirms the US Attorney’s Office’s dedication to collaborate with law enforcement and tribal authorities to bring to justice people who engage in unlawful behavior on tribal lands. “Together we will hold criminals accountable for their wrongdoing,” he added.</p>
<p>“The Gun Lake Tribe is committed to the safety and well-being of all persons within its jurisdiction and welcomes and appreciates the strong commitment and partnership with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan and local law enforcement.“ Seth Carter, interim director of public safety for the Gun Lake Tribe</p>
<p>Seth Carter, an interim director of public safety for the Gun Lake Tribe, spoke about the importance of the safety of the tribe’s members and guests on tribal land. He praised the efforts of the US Attorney’s Office and support from law enforcement. Finally, Carter said that the Tribe remains committed to preventing crimes and providing support while developing a community that is safe.</p>
