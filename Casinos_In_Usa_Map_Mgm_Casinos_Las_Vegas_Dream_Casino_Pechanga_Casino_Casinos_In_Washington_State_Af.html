<p>AffPapa has revealed a new partnership with PowerUp, a casino that focuses on recreating the retro arcade experience online and bringing its users a unique iGaming product that is hard to replicate anywhere else. The new partnership comes just after AffPapa has appointed a new chief executive to help the company steer towards even more ambitious performance markers.</p>
<p>The link-up with PowerUp is designed to connect the casino, which features more than 4,000 unique games, including slots and live casino games by tier-one providers, with some of the leading affiliate marketing experts in iGaming. To get there, PowerUp will now be able to benefit from AffPapa’s ample network of partners who can help the casino operator expand its reach.</p>
<p>Licensed under a Curacao eGaming permit, PowerUp is well-positioned to pursue international growth while also creating a safe and reliable gaming environment for players. PowerUp will be able to choose from a number of trusted affiliate partners who can help amplify the coverage for the brand and reach new players.</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, PowerUp CO-founder and Director Alfred Ballester said that everyone was quite excited about the partnership and appreciated the opportunities presented therein:</p>
<p>"At PowerUp-Partners we’re extremely excited to have joined AffPapa. With an experienced leadership team and a unique offering, AffPapa’s platform will provide our brand with the extra growth we’re looking for."</p>
<p>The casino's affiliate program is very competitive, offering rates of up to 50% and quick payments to partners, the press release informs. The opportunity was also welcomed by AffPapa Head of Commercials Yeva Avagyan who was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see PowerUp Casino become a part of the AffPapa family and find new opportunities to expand its reach.</p>
