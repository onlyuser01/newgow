    <h1>Eldorado Hotel And Casino Casino In Mesquite Soboba Casino Jobs Binions Casino Ojo Casino Route 777</h1>

<p>Route 777 review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Route 777 reimagines the hardcore biker road trip in line with a 777-slot. The game features a motorcycle gang patch and a desert background that can’t help but conjure up the idea of both Route 66 and the Hell’s Angels disaster at Altamont.</p>
<p>The reels are overlaid with a series of rotating animations of scorpions, dried cattle bones, and worn out cars dumped on the side of the road.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the open road, this slot is doing its best to create a high-octane version of the classic road trip adventure.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are a definite selling point for this slot. From the motes of dust that dance in the beams of the desert sunset background, to the orange-monochrome animated loops that frame the reels. The symbols are neat and simple, the gang patch is suitably threatening, and the standard fruit and bells are augmented with the fruit of a prickly pear cactus.</p>
<p>The slot is accompanied by a rock and roll soundtrack that echoes the feel of movies like Easy Rider. It all blends well with the jazzed up animations, and the win &amp; spin sounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the visual presentation of the slot is fantastic.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Route 777 is played on a three by three reel with seventeen win lines.</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty straightforward with a few simple twists, mostly relating to respins and a pair of bonuses (details below).</p>
<p>When the first two reels land with an identical set of symbols, the player is awarded with five respins. The first two reels move down by one symbol between each respin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols.</p>
<p>Hitting three Wilds on one spin triggers the Free Spin Bonus. The player gets a randomised number of free spins between five and fifteen.</p>
<p>Hitting three Wilds in one spin during the free spins trigger the Fortune Wheel Bonus. During this bonus, the wheel spins until the player either collects three identical sevens or the stop sign lands. If the player gets three identical sevens, the player is awarded the payout associated with the seven in question. Rarer sevens pay out more.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.3%, a little over our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a poor match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The low volatility of this slot turns us off a bit, but the decent RTP and excellent gameplay make it a good slot for the right kind of player. If you’re not too worried about the low variance play and have always dreamed of riding a chopped hog with the Hell’s Angels, this could be a good slot for you.</p>
<p>Otherwise you may want to give this one a skip and seek out something similar in the realm of minimalist slots.</p>
