    <h1>Soaring Eagles Casino Does Florida Have Casinos Asia Lotus Casino Jaragua Hotel Casino Treasure Isla</h1>

<p>Hello, I had deposited a total of £1714 throughout the whole of February, which was done through my partners debit card as we use the same account, and played without issues. Then out of nowhere after £1714 deposited a need to send verification documents, I then get told that the card used has to be removed from my account as it's not my card and I was breaching the terms and conditions by using it. I get the card verified in the end stating that I had my partners permission to use the card.</p>
<p>I go through a nightmare process verifying my ID because I didn't have access to my driving licence at the time, which I still don't now so my address can't be verified as they will not accept a credit card statement from an online credit card company as proof of address.</p>
<p>They claimed that I needed to send verification documents through as I had reached their threshold for this request, but in their terms and conditions, their threshold is £2000, I was at £1714. This to me sounds like they knew the card being used wasn't in my name and they wanted to allow me to deposit as much as possible and then they void the use of the card as it's not in my name.</p>
<p>I read through their terms and conditions and can not see anywhere that it states clearly that a third party payment method voids any bets, or is not allowed. My arguement with this is that I should not have been allowed to even deposit almost £2000 if they would have refused any winnings because of the card not being in my name.</p>
