    <h1>Treasure Island Resort And Casino Mn Betvisa Casino Online Gold Country Casino Oroville Casino Escan</h1>

<p>The new C-level addition will play a crucial role in the company’s international B2B expansion plans in the betting and gaming industry</p>
<p>Leading provider of player account management (PAM) platform services for sportsbook and iGaming operators, Soft2Bet, has appointed Martin Collins as its Chief Business Development Officer. Collins brings a wealth of experience in the iGaming sector and will drive Soft2Bet’s growth and expansion in the global B2B betting and gaming markets, helping the company stand out amidst harsh competition.</p>
<p>Collins Is a Perfect Fit for This Demanding Position</p>
<p>Soft2Bet, headquartered in Santa Venera, Malta, has a strong presence in European regulated markets and aims to grow its footprint in the B2B segment of the global betting and gaming industry. The company has achieved considerable momentum, finalizing several high-profile partnerships to strengthen its position in its most profitable jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The appointment of Martin Collins as Chief Business Development Officer underscores Soft2Bet’s commitment to achieving its growth plans. The new C-level addition has an impressive track record in the iGaming industry, making him an ideal candidate for this leadership role. Collins was excited to begin, noting that the company was in the perfect position to capitalize on its success.</p>
<p>I believe Soft2bet can be a unique and flexible offering to many major operators in the market, consistently working with their customers to help them achieve their goals. Martin Collins, Soft2bet Chief Business Development Officer</p>
<p>Collins previously worked as Director of Sales and Business Development at Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), another Malta-based betting and gaming solution provider. His two decades of relevant experience have fostered a passion and drive to help organizations flourish. Collins’ strategic skills should be invaluable for Soft2bet as he helps the company identify new business opportunities and pursue further growth.</p>
<p>The Company Will Use His Talents to Pursue New Heights</p>
<p>Soft2bet bolsters its leadership team during a pivotal moment as it recently obtained operating licenses for several high-profile European markets like Greece and Romania. Expanding into these new jurisdictions provides the leading supplier with unparalleled opportunities to bring value to operators, accelerating their growth. Soft2bet’s continued investments in its software and technology should allow it to find traction in these markets.</p>
<p>Collins’ appointment will also be instrumental in developing existing markets like Italy. Soft2bet recently secured a stable foothold in the region, giving it direct access to its thriving gambling industry. Soft2Bet CEO Uri Poliavich was enthusiastic about the new appointment, hoping the new CBDO would help the company maintain its impressive momentum.</p>
<p>We’re happy to welcome Martin to Soft2Bet and are looking forward to his vast experience and deep knowledge of our sector getting us to the next level! Uri Poliavich, Soft2Bet CEO</p>
<p>By onboarding Martin Collins as Chief Business Development Officer, Soft2Bet positions itself for continued growth and success in the international B2B betting and gaming markets. The company’s customer-centric approach and unrelenting focus on innovation allow it to consistently iterate and improve its offering, paving the way for new strategic partnerships and enduring growth.</p>
