    <h1>Mardi Gras Casino Resort Free 100 Registration Casino The Palms Resort Casino Las Vegas Casino In Al</h1>

<p>The provider of quality games, powering online gambling operators across the globe, Pragmatic Play, introduced its latest thrilling slot title. The company confirmed Monday the launch of Viking Forge, a new 5x6 slot game offering an RTP of 96.05% and engaging features such as Free Spins, coin collection and the player-favorite scatter pay mechanic.</p>
<p>As the name of the new slot suggests, it features a Viking theme. Just like other quality games offered by Pragmatic Play, Viking Forge uses quality sound effects and vibrant colors. The slot game utilizes standard card symbols between 10 and Ace along with symbols such as traditional Viking mugs, swords and hammers.</p>
<p>To elevate the excitement even further, Viking Forge grants a chance for mouth-watering payouts thanks to multipliers and the fan-favorite tumble feature. Engaging with the tumble feature, lucky players can secure subsequent wins from a single spin, taking home significant prizes, a statement released by Pragmatic Play reveals.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, was excited about the recently released slot game. "Our mythological games have proven time and again to be fan-favorites, and weâ€™re combining that with the ever-popular cascading wins mechanic in our latest creation, Viking Forge," she explained. Finally, Cornides pointed out: "Adding in a coin collection feature that can either award cash prizes or multipliers ensures fans of numerous game styles can embrace the Norse genre and enjoy a thrilling gaming experience."</p>
<p>To secure a win, players of Viking Forge need to land eight or more matching symbols anywhere on the reels during the base game. Once this happens, the winning symbols are removed from the reels, allowing new symbols to drop from above. This, in turn, creates a chance for subsequent wins from a single spin.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play's new slot also brings a coin collection feature. This feature enables coins to be "randomly attached to any other symbol during the base game," the iGaming content provider explains. Such coins can have a money value of up to 20x the player's wager or bring a multiplier of up to 10x. Lucky players who secure a combination with a coin benefit from a special meter that grants a payout once the game's tumble sequence ends.</p>
<p>To trigger the game's Free Spins bonus round, players need to land at least four Scatter symbols during the base game. Once this happens, they are awarded at least ten free games together with a payout that is at least 3x of their wager.</p>
