<p>BetMGM, the leading sports betting and iGaming operator, has brought a new talent to represent the company and become its latest celebrity brand ambassador. Vanessa Hudgens, who is a well-known face on American television, will help promote the brand and participate in various marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>She will be part of a sprawling overall marketing and social media attempt to help introduce BetMGM’s iGaming and casino solutions to broader audiences. Hudgens made her debut in the High School Musical series, playing the role of Gabriella Montez, but her role immediately led to other roles, such as "Bad Boys for Life," Tick, Tick… Boom!" and "Spring Breakers," all of which exposed her to Hollywood and further success.</p>
<p>She has done live shows for a number of productions, including FOX’s "Grease: Live" and the Broadway musical "Gigi." Hudgens’s name precedes her, and she will have the opportunity to help elevate the BetMGM brand to new heights.</p>
<p>BetMGM CRO Matt Prevost welcomed the new addition in the face of Vanessa and said that the talented and gifted actress will be particularly important to BetMGM’s further success and evolution as an entertainment heavyweight. Prevost offered nothing but praise for the new ambassador:</p>
<p>"We look forward to the partnership and her support in our goal of reaching new audiences in unique and engaging ways."</p>
<p>The company is also committed to raising its overall commitment to responsible gambling education, which is key in September under the American Gaming Association’slatest initiative. BetMGM has already partnered up with GameSense, a program that helps train staff to spot and recognize problem gambling in customers and developed by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation.</p>
<p>The GameSense program has been used by MGM Resorts proactively so that the company can constantly be on top of gambling harm and ensure that its members of staff are trained to act to the benefit of customers who may be experiencinggambling-related harm. Being at the frontline of the gambling industry also means that you need to be prepared to help guide consumers, BetMGM believes.</p>
<p>Hudgens’ addition definitely makes for a great opportunity to drive important messages with her fans who may also happen to be BetMGM customers and players. Recently, BetMGM launched another star-studded marketing campaign with Kevin Garnett, Barry Sanders, Wayne Gretzky, and others, titled "IT’S ON." More similar marketing campaigns are on their way as BetMGM continues to grow rapidly across North America.</p>
