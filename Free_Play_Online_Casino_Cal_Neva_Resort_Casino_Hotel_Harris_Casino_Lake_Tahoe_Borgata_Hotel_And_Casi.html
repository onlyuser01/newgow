    <h1>Free Play Online Casino Cal Neva Resort Casino Hotel Harris Casino Lake Tahoe Borgata Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I follow the advice of someone who advised me to post my problem on several forums.</p>
<p>I'll start from scratch.</p>
<p>On 05/23/2020 I made a deposit of € 250 at Casino Gods and took the welcome bonus over 100%. Then had 500 € balance. Wager was 40x bonus so 10k.</p>
<p>I started playing over several days until May 28th, 2018, I had over 10k and at that time I had € 1974.69 on my account.</p>
<p>The same day I logged in again and almost fell over. Balance € 250 ???</p>
<p>OK support wrote, he could not help and passed it on.</p>
<p>Received an email on the same day, I violated the bonus terms, reason high bet breach, bet between 14-30 €. Only a stake of € 5 was allowed. But I did a couple of feature buys and so it was my fault and the profit was justifiably gone.</p>
<p>Have also sent me the lists with all assignments, everything is clearly recognizable and correct.</p>
<p>OK I thought to myself, I got my deposit of € 250 again, just try again.</p>
<p>No bonus active, 250 € real money. So no bonus rules.</p>
<p>Started to play and made a € 100 Feature Buy at the balance of € 185 with White Rabbit. (No bonus, no problem). Bonus paid over € 1500.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I had a balance of € 1801, went to the cash register and requested payment.</p>
<p>Then a verification marathon started over 5 days. But no problem worked.</p>
<p>On 5.6.20 I log in and can't believe my eyes, account balance again 250 €, they want to be kidding me I thought.</p>
<p>Live chat again could not help but passed it on.</p>
<p>Again received an email that I had violated the bonus terms. With the same reason and the same attachment that was there the first time.</p>
<p>High Bet Breach bet between 14-30 €.</p>
<p>First, no bonus was active.</p>
<p>Secondly, I even made a bet of € 100.</p>
<p>So total nonsense.</p>
<p>I have now requested all records since my first deposit and have also contacted the internal complaints office.</p>
<p>Either it's just stupid or they just want to rip me off. But everything should be clear from the documents.</p>
<p>In any case, I stay tuned and don't let myself be kidnapped.</p>
<p>In this sense, nice weekend</p>
