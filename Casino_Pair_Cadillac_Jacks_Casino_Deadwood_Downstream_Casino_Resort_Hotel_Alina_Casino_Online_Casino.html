<p>Martina Åkerlund, CEO of Triggy AB said that the release of the American Football in their live score apps is a big success for Triggy and it is also a part of their strategy to offer multi-sport coverage. She also stated that more sports will be added in 2021 to build up their offerings on the U.S. market. Many ambitious pioneering sports betting operators have shown interest in the full in-play betting experience.</p>
<p>Triggy Ambitiously Strengthens Its Presence in the U.S.</p>
<p>Triggy’s goal is to become a hub for the development of interactive betting products that will give players the ability to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p>Although created a bit over three years ago Triggy has managed to create products that are innovative and embraced by SB Live, LeoAlerts, and Pinnacle Live Soccer Scores.</p>
