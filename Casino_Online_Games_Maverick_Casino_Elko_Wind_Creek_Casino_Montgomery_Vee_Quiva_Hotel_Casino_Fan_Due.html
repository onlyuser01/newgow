    <h1>Casino Online Games Maverick Casino Elko Wind Creek Casino Montgomery Vee Quiva Hotel Casino Fan Due</h1>

<p>Dear Basel999,</p>
<p>We apologize for any delays and for your frustration, however upon the first submission of documents our staff was not aware of the nature of your deposit, you then contacted us, the issue was rectified and the account was verified.</p>
<p>Due to certain security thresholds, your withdrawal request was cancelled and a photograph of you holding the Proof of ID document you provided was requested by the relevant department for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>The Svenplay Team</p>
<p>9.2 Svenplay holds the right to not process a payment if the Account Holder’s identity, age and place of residence and proof of funds have not been sufficiently verified.</p>
<p>58.3.16 Players may be requested at any given time to provide all necessary KYC documents for the verification of their account (proof of identity, payment method(s) and residence).</p>
<p>62.1 Payments are processed in a time not exceeding 72 hours starting from the moment that the request has been approved by the Payments Department. Before the first payment is made to the User via electronic payment methods (Skrill, Webmoney, Credit or Debit card, etc.), the client is obliged to upload an electronic copy of a passport of his national ID at the relevant section under his Profile. Svenplay, at its own discretion, may ask from the client additional documents (e.g. proof of address, selfies, etc.) prior to their first payment. Remember that forgery is severely punished by law and in cases of suspicion of placing a counterfeit or an edited copy of the documents by electronic methods, Svenplay reserves the right to send such documents to the appropriate regulatory authorities. 62.2 Before making the payment, the employees of the company will verify the correspondence of the name, surname, father’s name, birth dates of the client and also other data. If differences are found between the actual data and the data provided by the client, Svenplay reserves the right to make a refund for all bets by the User and refuse to pay out winnings to the User unless they prove their identity and accuracy of entered data.</p>
