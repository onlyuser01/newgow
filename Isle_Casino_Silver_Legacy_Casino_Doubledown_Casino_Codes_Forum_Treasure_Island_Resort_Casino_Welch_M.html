<p>Alanis Morissette’s Manager Gets Six Years for Stealing Millions, Blames Gambling Addiction</p>

<p>Alanis Morissette may be reflecting that it’s a little ironic that her business manager, Jonathan Schwartz, a man who was supposed to keep her affairs in order and manage her money, ended up pilfering all her cash and causing havoc.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Schwartz, 47, was sentenced to six years in prison for stealing over $7 million from Morissette and others, and ordered to pay $8.6 million in restitution.</p>
<p>“I alone am responsible for the devastation,” said Schwartz, who wept at the hearing. “I will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>One Hand in Her Pocket…</p>
<p>Schwartz, a partner in the firm GSO Business Management, who himself earned $1.2 million a year, admitted stealing almost $5 million from Morissette between May 2010 and January 2014, and more than $2 million from five other clients who have not been named. He claims he did it to fund his gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“At first, I ‘borrowed’ a little from clients, with the hopes that I would pay them back if I won that night’s bet. That snowballed, and as I kept losing, I kept stealing,” Schwartz wrote in a mea culpa, published in the Hollywood Reporter last month.</p>
<p>But prosecutors painted a different picture: one of a calculated schemer who stole to fund a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and not because he was in the throws of a self-destructive illness.</p>
<p>“Every expression of remorse he has made and every purported act of self-improvement he has taken occurred only after he realized he had no ‘choice’ to do otherwise,” Assistant US Attorney Ranee Katzenstein said in a court filing.</p>
<p>The Mess You Left…</p>
<p>The court heard how Schwartz was at first able to hide the money he stole by claiming Morissette was a spendthrift who built studios and bought houses against his advice. When confronted with the theft, he claimed she was a drug addict who was mentally unstable.</p>
<p>“I’d go on tours he recommended and they would lose money, but he’d still urge me to spend! Spend! Spend! He was creating an alibi from the start,” said Morissette in a statement to the court.</p>
<p>“He not only stole $5 million in cash from me, he stole a dream,” she said, adding that the betrayal of trust had “shaken her to the core.”</p>
<p>His former partner in the business, Bernard Gudvi, said in addition to the stolen money Schwartz’s actions are expected to cause $20 million-worth of damage due to the blow to the company’s reputation.</p>
