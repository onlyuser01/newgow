    <h1>The Meadows Casino Movie Casino Royale Cast Murphy Nc Casino Green Valley Ranch Hotel Casino Border</h1>

<p>Bingo and online slots brand MrQ has added a new content partner with Relax Gaming’s Powered By and Silver Bullet aggregation solutions as well as original content.</p>
<p>MrQ Adds Relax Gaming Aggregated and Original Content</p>
<p>Despite regulatory challenges in the United Kingdom, premier supplier of iGaming solutions, Relax Gaming, has consolidated its footprint in the country, deepening ties with bingo and slots company MrQ.com, owned by Lindar Media.</p>
<p>MrQ.com is the leading company for Lindar on the UK market, now adding a further appeal to its offer with the incorporation of Relax Gaming’s in-house gaming products as well as third-party games.</p>
<p>Relax’s products available under Silver Bullet and Powered By studio partners, which include NetEnt but also Kalamba Games, 4ThePlayer, and Fantasma, as well as proprietor titles such as Snake Arena and Hellcatraz, have gone live on MrQ as a result.</p>
<p>Commenting on these news, Lindar Media’s managing director, Savvas Fellas, offered praise of Relax Gaming’s platform, which comes with quick and easy access, as well as a wide variety of games that appeal to players. Fellas was convinced that the addition of Relax’s solutions would allow Lindar, and MrQ in particular, to consolidate its market share. He further had this to add:</p>
<p>“We’re excited to collaborate with the Relax team to deliver an experience that engages and retains a large player base in the UK. The Relax catalogue will also help us as we look to take MrQ into different markets.”</p>
<p>Daniel Eskola, COO at Relax Gaming, also had a few things to add. He specifically expressed Relax’s satisfaction to have been among Lindar’s first choices in deciding to expand MrQ’s slots and bingo offer and adding innovative titles to the existing offer.</p>
<p>Eskola said that adding yet another partner was only a confirmation that Relax Gaming was capable to adapt and continue with a well-rehearsed expansion strategy, which should see the addition of more high-profile partners.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has previously broken crypto ground with the addition of Roobet, a crypto-focused online casino, and iGaming operator. MrQ.com has been part of the UK market since it launched back in 2018, obtaining the relevant license from the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) and gradually expanding its clout.</p>
<p>The addition of Relax Gaming software is the third content deal MrQ has signed since it was inaugurated into the United Kingdom two years ago. The move will allow MrQ to offer a more diversified portfolio whereas Relax can ink another name to the company’s list of growing partners.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Relax Gaming added Apollo’s portfolio to its Powered By aggregation vertical. As a result, Powered By will now feature Apollo’s HTML5-friendly and optimized award-winning titles, such as Gangster World, Slot Birds and Bonus Joker II.</p>
<p>In fact, Relax already has over 50 studio partners today, making its platform one of the largest in business.</p>
