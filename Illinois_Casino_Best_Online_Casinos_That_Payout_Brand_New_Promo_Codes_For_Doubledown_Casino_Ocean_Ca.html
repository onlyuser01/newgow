<p>Mermaid Millions Review</p>
<p>Theme and Story Line</p>
<p>Mermaids Millions slot machine takes you down under the sea, where Neptune rules and the mermaids play. There is sunken pirates’ booty and all manner of sea creatures as well as the mythical mermaids who deliver the big bucks.</p>
<p>The theme clearly draws on Disney’s The Little Mermaid while making sure not to annoy Mickey Mouse’s copyright lawyers.</p>
<p>Like the lobster says: Everything’s better down where it’s wetter; take it from me.</p>
<p>Mermaids Millions is a 5 reel slot with 15 winlines</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics and animations are professional and high def. They look excellent on any size screen. The fact that the background is blue can strain the eyes a bit, but the Symbols show up well against the colour and so the visuals do work.</p>
<p>The soundtrack between spins is a pleasant underwater bubbling noise, which is oddly relaxing. When you spin the reels the soundscape wakes up a bit and there are the chimes and spinning noises you would expect.</p>
<p>Overall Mermaids Millions looks good and sounds good.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The basic game is a five reel slot with anywhere from one winline up to fifteen.</p>
<p>There are two different bonus games triggered by hitting either the Scatter or Treasure symbols (more on these below).</p>
<p>The slot is easy to get into and all the controls are highly intuitive. By switching on the expert settings you can set up the auto play options, or else use the preprogrammed 5x and 10x auto play buttons.</p>
<p>It all makes for a well-paced experience.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>As previously mentioned the game has two bonus symbols: the Mermaid and Treasure symbols.</p>
<p>The Mermaid symbol is a Scatter. However, if you hit three or more of the Mermaid symbol you also trigger a Free Spin bonus of 10 free spins. During the free spins, every payout is tripled.</p>
<p>The Treasure symbol is a Bonus symbol. It triggers a minigame in which you may open a number of boxes to generate a prize. The more symbols you hit the bonus with, the more boxes you may open. You can still hit the treasure bonus during the Free Spins.</p>
<p>On top of this, the Neptune symbol is wild. This wild symbol will also pay out independently should you hit a winline with more than one of them.</p>
<p>The Neptune symbol can assist with hitting any winline apart from the Scatter (Mermaid) and Treasure symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>This game has a decent RTP of 96.56% which is about the average for the industry.</p>
<p>There is a 75 coin maximum per spin. However, you can set the value of the coin from anywhere between $0.01 to €/£/$1.00 at the site we tested, which gives more than enough flexibility in your bet size (a bet spread of between €/£/$0.01 to €/£/$75.00 per spin).</p>
<p>Mermaids Millions is a medium volatility slot with a maximum single line payout of 7500 times the line bet (for five Neptune symbols) on a regular spin or 22,500 times during free spins.</p>
<p>Gameplay video featuring free spins</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mermaids Millions is nice to look at, with solid gameplay and a wide range of bonus features for such an old slot.</p>
<p>Its RTP is pretty standard so for our recommended strategies we would recommend increasing the volatility by playing fewer winlines.</p>
<p>All in all, it is a decent slot that is easy to recommend.</p>
