<p>The nation-wide lockdown has prompted more people to turn to online poker, bringing a 60% traffic spike for 888poker.</p>
<p>Poker Giant 888 Sees 60% Increase in Traffic in April</p>
<p>888 Holdings, the company that operates 888poker and multiple other gambling outlets, has reported a significant increase in traffic in the United States. According to data released by 888, the number of active players is 60% higher year-over-year (YOY).</p>
<p>Head of Commercial Development at 888 Holdings, Yaniv Sherman commented on the number, explaining that there has been an “uptake in daily poker active players” on the company’s U.S. poker platform.</p>
<p>Specifically, Sherman said that the Interstate Poker Network, covering several regulated poker markets in the United States, has registered the traffic benefits. Sherman also commented on the company’s global poker network, confirming that players have been more active in the past few months.</p>
<p>“We are seeing similar trends on our global poker network, a testament of a recreational destination that people are enjoying while sheltering in place.”</p>
<p>Poker is practically returning to the mainstream. Once outlawed as a black sheep in the United States, after the decision in the United States v. Scheinberg ruled that PokerStars, Cereus, Absolute Poker, and Full Tilt Poker had violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).</p>
<p>The decision dated April 15, 2020, prompted the complete shutdown of online poker anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>The First Time in a Long Time Poker Is Growing</p>
<p>The 888poker products have fared well, though. After 2011, Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey hurried up to bring independent legislations allowing them to conduct online poker and even pool their prize pools.</p>
<p>The company operates in all three markets, and most recently – Pennsylvania. Furthermore, 888 is also hosting the World Series of Poker (WSOP), the world’s most prestigious poker event that has been pushed back to an undisclosed date in the fall of 2020 due to the current lockdown in Nevada.</p>
<p>Commenting on recent developments, Sherman said that this had been the first time in a long time that there was a growing poker network and strengthened demand, particularly in the United States.</p>
<p>Sherman emphasized on the importance of providing players with the online experience they expect.</p>
<p>“If people can opt for the online experience, they will do it if they have a good online experience. People have more time on their hands and are looking for things to do. Ironically, poker is now more taboo than sports gambling. But at the same time, betting is now entertainment, and so it is easier to get legislation passed that allows for it.”</p>
<p>888poker has a chance to win over new customers, and the company seems to know how exactly. “This is not the Wild West,” Sherman said, adding that the company would seek to offer the best experience novice players can get, and help them establish themselves on the platform.</p>
<p>Hopefully, online poker will continue to grow after the lockdown is over, or so 888poker and Sherman hope.</p>
