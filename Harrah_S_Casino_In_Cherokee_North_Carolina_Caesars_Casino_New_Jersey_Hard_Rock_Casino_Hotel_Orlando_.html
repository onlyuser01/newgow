<p>Award-winning supplier of live casino games Authentic Gaming has leveraged its international success to “hit the ground running” for its Spanish launch.</p>
<p>Bringing Quality and Innovative Products for Spanish Players</p>
<p>Authentic Gaming has expanded its operations to the Spanish gaming market as the company continues to scale its global footprint. As a result, the company has launched its live table games portfolio in one of Europe’s highest-grossing markets, with several operators already signing up with Authentic Gaming. The company will not stop there, as it looks to expand its product portfolio to other brands that are regulated on the Spanish gaming market. This should happen over the coming months, the company said in a press release.</p>
<p>Authentic Gaming has been able to negotiate a swift market entry by obtaining the necessary regulatory approval and leveraging its existing relationships with global operators already present in the country. The live dealer studio will provide games streamed from the prestigious Gan Via Casino in Madrid, where Authentic Gaming introduced five-wheel installations.</p>
<p>This marks the highest number of live wheel casino games any operator in the country presently has with the products accessible through iJuego.es del Casino Gran Via. Authentic is also launching with roulette, which comes in three main categories divvied up across Studio, Auto Roulette, and Authentic Roulette.</p>
<p>Commenting on this success, Authentic Gaming CCO Magdalena Podhorska-Okolow said, “This is a significant time and strategic move for Authentic Gaming. Our debut in Spain has allowed our operating partners to launch our content in yet another regulated market and will undoubtedly pave (the) way for new operators to add a good variety of new roulette games to their players.”</p>
<p>Tapping into the Quick Expansion of the Spanish Market</p>
<p>The decision to launch on the Spanish market comes as Authentic Gaming is determined to continue and expand its offer in licensed jurisdictions and leverage its knowledge of live dealer games to break ground into still underrepresented verticals in the country.</p>
<p>With Spain posting 43% year-over-year growth between 2018 and 2020, Authentic is confident that the market will continue to represent a strong opportunity for live dealer game operators. While the country has introduced new gambling rules limiting the scope of the industry, Authentic Gaming and others are optimistic about future growth opportunities.</p>
<p>“Our current offer in Spain is innovative and unique in this sector, meaning we will be able to partner with the very best and they can offer an unrivaled experience to their player base,” Podhorska-Okolow concluded.</p>
