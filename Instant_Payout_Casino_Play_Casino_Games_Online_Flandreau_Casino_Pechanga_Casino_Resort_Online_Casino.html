    <h1>Instant Payout Casino Play Casino Games Online Flandreau Casino Pechanga Casino Resort Online Casino</h1>

<p>The casino and hospitality juggernaut has once again proven its commitment to sustainable, responsible and transparent practices</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has become the first gambling company to support the United Nations’ CEO Water Mandate. The latter initiative seeks to raise awareness of water crises and address the problem.</p>
<p>The CEO Water Mandate was established in collaboration between the UN Secretary-General, the UN Global Compact and the Pacific Institute. It seeks to encourage companies in the power sector to be responsible when it comes to water-related practices.</p>
<p>CEO Water Mandate supporters should improve their practices in six core areas – direct operations, supply chain and watershed management, collective action, public policy, community engagement and transparency.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, the CEO Water Mandate is supported by a total of 234 companies from various sectors.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts Remains Committed to Sustainability</p>
<p>MGM Resorts’ president and chief executive, Bill Hornbuckle, addressed his company’s decision to sign the mandate. He noted that Las Vegas’ innovative approach to water has taught his company a lot. MGM plans to use this knowledge to improve its practices, realizing the ongoing effects of climate change in the Western United States.</p>
<p>The ongoing drought and effects of climate change in the Western U.S. are a wake-up call that we need to do more, and to that end—we’re proud to endorse the CEO Water Mandate to not only share what we’ve learned in Las Vegas, but also help strengthen our commitments. Bill Hornbuckle, president &amp; CEO, MGM Resorts</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is a business that truly depends on water, considering all of its beautiful fountains and luxurious pools. The company understands that it needs to be more responsible in managing its water resources and managed to reduce its consumption by 37% between 2007 and 2021. In 2022, the company also finalized its Global Water Policy.</p>
<p>Other notable water-saving initiatives have seen the casino giant replace large sectors of real grass with drought-tolerant landscaping in its Las Vegas properties. Furthermore, the company has been installing a variety of water-saving fixtures across its venues, helping it further reduce unnecessary consumption. MGM Resorts also augmented the efficiency of its Las Vegas cooling tower systems which helped it bring down evaporative loss.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has been committed to making its business as sustainable and responsible as possible. Thanks to that, MGM Resorts is a member of the A-List of leaders in corporate transparency when it comes to the usage of water and responsibility to climate change. The casino and hospitality juggernaut was also invited to attend the 2023 UN Water Conference next month.</p>
