<p>The Hell is Real Derby is on the program on Sunday, July 17. The clash between two Ohio-based MLS franchises – Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati – is one of the most interesting matchups of the entire round.</p>
<p>This is going to be the 10th duel between these two interstate rivals. Currently, Columbus Crew leads the series with four wins, three draws, and two losses. It’s needless to say that Cincinnati FC players are going to give their utmost in Sunday’s Ohio Derby to try to improve their all-time record. Getting one over their main rivals is just one in a long list of reasons why this is going to be a super-exciting clash.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps even more important reason, is that there’s just one point separating the two teams that have playoff ambitions in 2022. Further, both Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati are without a single loss since May.</p>

<p>Columbus Crew Favored to Win the Hell is Real Derby</p>
<p>Even though they have just one point more than Cincinnati FC (as well as one game more), Columbus Crew are seen as odds-on favorites in the eyes of the bookies. If you’re wondering why their odds are so short, it’s because this team has recently signed a couple of really good players.</p>
<p>The best example is Colombian forward Cucho, a 23-year-old who played for Watford in the English Premier League last season. He came to Columbus earlier this month and has two games so far. Did he impress in those games? He sure did – Cucho scored a total of three goals in those matches.</p>
<p>More good news for Columbus Crew is that two of their first-team players – Milos Degenek (defender) and Arthur (midfielder) are ready to come back after spending several games sidelined due to fitness concerns.</p>
<p>FC Cincinnati Hoping to Stay Undefeated for a While Longer</p>
<p>May 28 was when FC Cincinnati lost an MLS game the last time. That’s when CF Montreal beat them 4-3 in Canada. Since then, we saw FC Cincinnati win one game and play a draw on five occasions.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that in each of those matches, FC Cincinnati scored. In fact, they scored a total of 10 goals in those five games. Unfortunately for them, they also conceded a lot of goals.</p>
<p>As a result, their score differential in the 2022 MLS is 32-35. This makes their offense third best in the Eastern Conference, while their defense is third worst.</p>
<p>Columbus Crew vs FC Cincinnati Prediction</p>
<p>Our prediction is that the Hell is Real Derby is going to be a hell of a game. We’re certain that both teams are going to play great soccer, possibly scoring plenty of goals. That said, we do think Columbus Crew will score a goal or two more than Cincinnati FC.</p>
<p>Picks: Columbus Crew to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
