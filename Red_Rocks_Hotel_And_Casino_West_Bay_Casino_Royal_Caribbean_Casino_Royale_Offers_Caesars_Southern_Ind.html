    <h1>Red Rocks Hotel And Casino West Bay Casino Royal Caribbean Casino Royale Offers Caesars Southern Ind</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>First, I need to emphasize that any lack of amounts processed or at least requested within the time-frame is indicative enough to prove that there was no transaction pending within the time frame. Every player can check that for themselves accessing the path below using any desktop browser or the designated desktop app:</p>
<p>Cashier &gt;&gt; My Account &gt;&gt; Account History &gt;&gt; Select date range up to a month back &gt;&gt; Search</p>
<p>Regarding the screenshot, please note that this does not look anything like our payout confirmation email. Having withdrawn a couple of times with us, the player should be aware of that. Still, as suggested, we have double checked our email base and found naught resembling the provided screenshot.</p>
<p>We advise the user to check their email security because the provided evidence did not come out of any email exchange with us. Email security is very important in online casino business, because parties can endanger their funds when there actually is a real withdrawal request.</p>
<p>In case the player is worried about their email security, they may contact us to temporarily disable the account and re-verify it before the user confirms they are feeling safe to use it once again. In case no email of sorts is extended to us, we will consider the player feels safe about their email safety.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Mikey</p>
<p>Casino Extreme Management</p>
