    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino Casino In Eagle Pass Casino Card Game Rules Southland Casino Hotel Ca</h1>

<p>On the 13th/2/2023 I had won $900 with betway casino, under no bonuses</p>
<p>I put in for a withdrawal, I needed a new card verified. So I sent in all photo ID and bank details they asked for ( I have used this casino for years and have had all cards and accounts previously verified) while waiting for card to be verified I asked for a bank transfer withdrawal. Few days later I received an email stating that my new card had been verified and my $900 withdrawal had been REPROCESSED (which I did not asked for) I waited over 5 days and nothing showing in my bank so I contacted betway live chat and they said they had processed my withdrawal into my SWIFT account and gave me last 4 numbers, I then told them I dont and never have had a swift account and that was not my account, a day later I received an email stating my swift account withdrawal was unable to be processed as name and swift account didnt match. I then said please reprocess to my bank card that was verified. 2 days later I contacted them again and they said they cannot process to my new card as my bank does not accept payment from them?????.</p>
<p>So I had to open a new option of withdrawal and went with Neteller and asked them to process my withdrawal to my neteller account. They then said all this new account needs to be verified and I have to send all photo ID etc to them AGAIN. It has been 4 days and I just contacted them again to be told they still trying to sort neteller getting verified and i have to be patient. I think ive been more than patient, and now just getting the run around... can some one please help</p>
