<p>Megan Fox Plays Casino Owner in New Movie</p>

<p>In Megan Fox’s next film, she plays a casino owner with a highly questionable correlation to reality. “Johnny &amp; Clyde” is a grindhouse slasher flick featuring gratuitous killing, Megan Fox looking great, and apparently not much else.</p>

<p>So far, the movie has four one-star ratings on imdb.com — there are no zero-star ratings — including this one, from user psxexperten: “This was the most pointless excuse of a movie I have ever seen. I want my time back.”</p>
<p>Based on the trailer that dropped Wednesday from Screen Media, Fox’s Alana, who runs a casino in Rhode Island for her father in Las Vegas, finds herself defending her gaming establishment against Johnny and Clyde (Avan Jorgia and Ajani Russell), a mass-murdering couple in need of a fresh infusion of cash to support their mass-murdering lifestyle.</p>
<p>While robbing an armed vehicle owned by Alana’s casino and killing its driver, the couple discovers that Alana’s casino features a secret vault because Alana also happens to be a crime boss.</p>
<p>Think “Bonnie &amp; Clyde” meets “Ocean’s 11” meets “Natural Born Killers.”</p>
<p>Don’t Think Oscar Buzz</p>
<p>Little do Johnny and Clyde know that Alana has a secret weapon awaiting them — a vicious, axe-wielding undead slasher-demon casino guard named Bakwas. The trailer concludes by showing Alana firing multiple weapons, including a rifle she uses to shoot pottery off a woman’s head at close range.</p>
<p>But don’t take our word for how good it looks. Judge for yourself:</p>
<p>Twisted Tale</p>
<p>In an interview with horror movie site Bloody Disgusting, the film’s director describes Fox’s character as “very dark.”</p>
<p>I don’t want to give away too much, but visually we wanted her to almost be like a Disney princess, but a messed-up, very dark, twisted version of that,” Tom DeNucci said.</p>
<p>DeNucci also helmed 2019’s “Vault,” starring Don Johnson, and is really establishing himself as the director of choice for unbearably bad movies about vault break-ins.</p>
