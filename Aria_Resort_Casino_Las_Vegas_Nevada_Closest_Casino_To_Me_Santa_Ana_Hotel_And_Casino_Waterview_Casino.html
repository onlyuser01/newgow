    <h1>Aria Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Closest Casino To Me Santa Ana Hotel And Casino Waterview Casino</h1>

<p>I have played with the same card and bank account, revolut, for a year or so now and never had an issue other than they would only pay back to the account not the card. Suddenly with this wirhdrawl they are demanding a Spanish mobile number, I have lobster (UK) and have sent line proof, and also they are demanding a Spanish bank</p>
<p>account which I do not have and do not want. They have paid higher amounts to my revolut account in the past but won't pay this. Please help. BTW I had to make a new account here as I couldn't reset my password, it wouldn't let me</p>
