<p>The next iRacing event in the eNASCAR Invitational Pro Series is on the cards. We are looking at Dover International Speedway’s 150-lap race. This is an opportunity for Hendrick Motorsports to clinch a fourth race in a row.</p>
<p>eNASCAR Pro Series Dover Overview</p>
<p>The eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series is heading for Dover International Speedway’s virtual Monster Mile up on Sunday, May 3. The event is the next on the eNASCAR racing list, a relief for NASCAR fans who thought the lockdown would force motorsports to come to a halt. If anything, we have seen an uptick in virtual races, and the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series has clocked some pretty impressive viewership numbers.</p>
<p>Hendrick Motorsports has been winning every competition so far quite unapologetically. Well, if not every then at least the last three races. Alex Bowman edged out fellow teammate William Byron during the Talladega Superspeedway race.</p>
<p>Byron himself had had quite the run before that – winning both Richmond Raceway and Bristol Motor Speedway, becoming the first racers to have notched up a back-to-back victory plain and simple. There are 150 laps to be clocked this weekend and you better gear up!</p>

<p>Where and When to Watch eNASCAR Dover International Speedway 2020</p>
<p>Date : Sunday, May 3</p>
<p>: Sunday, May 3 Time : 1 p.m. ET</p>
<p>: 1 p.m. ET Stream/TV: FOX, FS1, Fox Sports App</p>
<p>This Sunday’s eNASCAR Finish Line 150 race will be covered by FOX and FS1, as well as on the company’s dedicated sports app. The sixth race in the Pro Invitational Series will feature 150 laps, as the name already suggests.</p>
<p>All top three finishers from the previous bout, Talladega, will have to start at the back, with Bowman, Corey Lajoie (+2500) and Ryan Preece (+1200) having a bit of a challenge to overcome to make it to pole position again. To make things easier for you, NASCAR has featured Live Racing Updates for you to benefit from fully.</p>
<p>Before the actual race, though, you will get to watch the Saturday Night Thunder program which kicks off at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, so if you insist on watching a game before the Sunday showdown, this is your chance. The event will be available at both eNASCAR.com/live but also NASCAR’s official YouTube channel.</p>
<p>What Can We Expect from Dover Speedway Looking at the Odds?</p>
<p>The Dover Speedway looks promising, packing quite the field of contestants. Naturally – after all eNASCAR doesn’t shift the pool of drivers from the next, yet it’s good to have a look at the participants’ list one more time.</p>
<p>As usual, sportsbooks have inevitably placed William Byron (+175) in the lead. The two-times eNASCAR Invitational Pro Series single races winner is always in the lead, getting accolades from the bookies.</p>
<p>I had so many questions about what just happened.. then we found 2nd hand footage at the end. I cannot believe it. pic.twitter.com/BfN1sNAsg8 — Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>Byron has kept a good pace, always neck-and-neck with Timmy Hill who keep in the lead. Meanwhile, despite his recent win, Bowman is listed down the odds list at (+2000). Other notable picks, though include Ryan Preece (+1200) who has made it to top 10 last Sunday.</p>
<p>There was also Kyle Busch (+2000) who pulled eight followed by Kurt Busch (+3300) in the ninth position. An amusing upset during Talladega was Denny Hamlin (+1000) swooped in and hit the power button of her dad’s computer – way to call it.</p>
