<p>EveryMatrix has confirmed that its slot aggregation and content platform SlotMatrix will now be part of betPARX’s offer in several states. betPARX is an operator of gaming and betting products and it’s one of the most prominent brands in the United States. Moving forward, the operator’s library will be strengthened by SlotMatrix’s exceptional quality games and products.</p>
<p>SlotMatrix is a powerful aggregation solution that features more than 300 studio partners along with over 22,000 games, and it will be bringing a range of fresh experiences to players in several states, including NewJersey, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. EveryMatrix is still in the process of finalizing its license in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The two companies are also not shy about expanding their collaboration in other iGaming states when the opportunity arises. EveryMatrix holds licenses in multiple other states as well, including West Virginia, Connecticut and beyond that - in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>This new partnership supplements a previous arrangement between EveryMatrix and betPARX under the conditions of which, EveryMatrix brought its in-house studio games developed by Spearhead Studios and Armadillo Studios to betPARX through CasinoEngine, its bespoke iGaming Integration Platform.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Americas President Erik Nyman welcomed the opportunity to see his company embark on this adventure with betPARX and provide it with a powerful aggregation solution that features a variety of excellent features, including free spins tournaments, leaderboards, jackpot capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>"As a result, we are very confident betPARX will boost its player retention and significantly grow its business using our aggregator SlotMatrix," Nyman said.</p>
<p>betPARX Senior Director of Interactive Marketing Gil Bushkin was similarly happy with the news and welcomed the opportunity to work with EveryMatrix and benefit from the platform and company’s capabilities.</p>
<p>"betPARX continuously seek to incorporate well-known, exciting, and highly sought-after game titles to provide an enjoyable user experience for our players," Bushkin noted. SlotMatrix has been a largely popular solution as well.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the content aggregation platform was integrated directly into Livespins, a socially charged live casino experience that focuses on slot streaming. This new launch with betPARX further strengthens EveryMatrix’s position in the United States fast developing iGaming landscape.</p>
