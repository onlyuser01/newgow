    <h1>Grand Casino Hinckley Mn Little Creek Resort Casino New Casino Las Vegas Casino Coushatta Seneca Nia</h1>

<p>Gambling products and services provider Scientific Games has scored a huge win as it has had its Connecticut Lottery contract extended. The Connecticut Lottery Corporation has signed in Scientific Games for another five years, providing the gambling company with its industry-leading digital second-chance drawing platform and second-chance drawing services. The deal also notably covers Scientific Games’ NextGen mobile app and customer management services.</p>
<p>Depending on how the deal develops, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation might decide to extend the contract by three more years.</p>
<p>A Second-Chance Platform Will Launch Soon</p>
<p>The second-chance platform is scheduled to release at the beginning of 2022, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Connecticut Lottery. The launch will implement various promotions, celebrating 5 decades of lottery, which is a huge part of the plans for expanding digital player engagement.</p>
<p>Pete Donahue, the senior director of marketing and interim director of sales for the Connecticut Lottery, has spoken on the matter. He emphasized that Scientific Games is a long-time valued partner for retail instant-win games and has been one since the 1970s. In Donahue’s words, the lottery’s players adore second-chance programs, which is why the lottery is excited of the prospects to have a new, modernized, more consistent, and more meaningful engagement with them.</p>
<p>“Our new second-chance platform and CRM tools will allow us to enhance our player relationships and the player journey,” Donahue concluded.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the Connecticut Lottery is one of the Top 10 lotteries for the instant game per capita sales. With the deal in place, it will offer even more tempting promotions to its digital players.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is Glad to Continue Working With the Lottery</p>
<p>Scientific Games is glad to be able to continue its partnership with the Connecticut Lottery. The vice president of SG’s digital content studio, Amy Bergette, spoke on the deal. According to her, the continued partnership between the two parties is a recipe for success.</p>
<p>“With Scientific Games’ second-chance drawing platform and services, NextGen mobile app, and proven lottery CRM program, the Connecticut Lottery will further enhance player engagement with the Lottery’s brand and will move to a more sophisticated approach with digital campaign management,” Bergette commented.</p>
<p>With the deal extended, Scientific Games will remain the primary instant games provider of the Connecticut Lottery. The Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership program will see SG responsible for product management, retail optimization, logistics, and digital engagement.</p>
<p>Scientific Games is a famous provider of lotteries and iGaming titles. The company had reportedly planned to launch an IPO for its Australian lotteries but eventually gave up on the idea and sold the business for $6 billion.</p>
