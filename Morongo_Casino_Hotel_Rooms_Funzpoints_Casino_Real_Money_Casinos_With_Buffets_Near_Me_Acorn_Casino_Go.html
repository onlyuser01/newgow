<p>BGaming will be able to expand its global presence and reach more players</p>
<p>BGaming has penned a new partnership agreement with Casimba Gaming, a provider of customer-centric aggregation solutions, marketing data, design and development expertise. Under the agreement, BGaming’s award-winning portfolio of casino games will be integrated into Casimba’s aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As announced, the studio’s lineup of over 100 mobile-friendly titles will make its way into Casimba’s B2B solution. As a result, the latter company’s partners and their players will be able to access fan favorites such as the crypto-casino-themed Limbo XY and the Nordic-themed Gemhalla.</p>
<p>The partnership will help Casimba Gaming cement itself as a leading industry name. By integrating more games into its portfolio, the company will be able to “meet the increased demand for a high-quality iGaming experience.”</p>
<p>Casimba Gaming is a newly launched brand resulting from the recent merger between the marketing and software development agency Whitezip and the platform provider Markor Technology.</p>
<p>The Two Companies Are Delighted to Work Together</p>
<p>Casimba Gaming’s director of B2B, Lavina Karlsson, commented on the new tie-up. She said that the partnership with an esteemed software provider such as BGaming is a great opportunity to elevate Casimba’s aggregation service. As a result, the company will be able to “deliver a heightened level of diversity and innovation,” Karlsson said.</p>
<p>BGaming’s contribution can be observed in the vast selection of user-friendly, mobile-optimized slots and crypto-casino-themed games, which we can now extend to our casino partners in the future. Lavina Karlsson, director of B2B, Casimba Gaming</p>
<p>In the meantime, BGaming’s head of sales, Olga Levshina, said that her team is happy to join forces with Casimba Gaming. Levshina said that she hopes for a fruitful partnership that will extend BGaming’s presence.</p>
<p>We are delighted to work with Casimba Gaming, who are such an important and significant client for us. We are confident that this partnership will strengthen our presence in major markets, including Europe and Canada, as the provider continues its growth trajectory. Olga Levshina, head of sales, BGaming</p>
<p>Speaking of BGaming, the studio just rolled out Savage Buffalo Spirit Megaways, a Megaways spin on its hit buffalo-themed title. This followed the release of a dice-themed slot called Dice Million and a magic-themed game titled Luck&amp;Magic.</p>
