    <h1>Casino And Hotel Tulsa Casino Keyboard Lucky 7 Casino Hotel Caesars Casino New Orleans Murphy Nc Cas</h1>

<p>Developer of iGaming products Stakelogic has partnered up with Soft2Bet, a company that focuses on the development of casino and sportsbook platform options and engines. As a result, Stakelogic’s slots and live casino games will be integrated with Soft2Bet. This will immediately make them available to Soft2Bet B2B partners and casinos, such as Yoyo Casino and Betinia.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has an established presence in both the slot and live casino segment, and it runs a number of exciting games that have helped the company build up its portfolio and reputation. Some of the noteworthy games run by Stakelogic include versions of blackjack, auto-roulette, roulette, and an array of money-wheel game shows.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has developed hit titles such as Wild Buzz, Zickie Zacke, El Cowboy Megaways, Wild Moon Saloon, and others. In so far as some of the authentic Live Casino titles are concerned, Stakelogic has a lot to show up for, including the Super Stake Roulette 5,000x, its latest addition to the live dealer segment, and a worthy continuation of its growing portfolio.</p>
<p>Stakelogic Live has an advanced product development process and established best practices to help it build one of the best Live Casino overall offerings in what is already a very competitive market, to begin with. Soft2Bet director of gaming Daniel Mitton welcomed this opportunity to work with the prominent iGaming developer and said:</p>
<p>Stakelogic is widely recognized and respected in the industry due to its exciting product offering, while its new live casino range delivered through Stakelogic Live is truly breath-taking. We can’t wait to see where this partnership goes as both our companies continue to expand in regulated markets.</p>
<p>Stakelogic sales manager Danila Dzehs was equally pleased with the opportunity to collaborate closely with Soft2Bet. Dzehs added that Soft2Bet is precisely what Stakelogic has been looking for in a partner and praised the former’s state-of-the-art platform and network of prestigious brands. The partnership naturally helps both brands raise their profile and increase their presence in the iGaming market.</p>
<p>Stakelogic is clearly happy to make sure that its products may reach bigger audiences whereas Soft2Bet has a bigger leverage to use when offering its platform solutions to third-party interested in getting the whole package, which includes brilliant online slots and Live Casino titles.</p>
<p>Stakelogic has also been looking to expand quickly across different markets. In March, the company established a partnership in the Netherlands with Jack’s Casino in a bid to secure a bigger footprint in Europe.</p>
