<p>UK betting exchange Smarkets has expanded its partnership with the marketing brand Strive Sponsorship. The latter agreed to power Smarkets’ websites with daily sports content.</p>
<p>Strive to Power Smarkets with Content</p>
<p>As per the deal, Strive Sponsorship will provide content, podcasts and editing services to Smarkets News and SBK Betting Zone. Thanks to Strive’s talented writing team, Smarkets’ sites will receive coverage of nine of the most popular sports. This includes the National Football League, the National Basketball League, soccer, rugby and golf, among others. Content will include articles, opinion pieces, betting tips, podcasts and more.</p>
<p>This agreement builds on Smarkets and Strive Sponsorship’s existing deal. The two companies have worked together for four years now, which has seen Strive take care of Smarkets’ social media by providing it with engaging sports content and services.</p>
<p>Strive Is Ready to Boost Smarkets’ Sites</p>
<p>Malph Minns, the managing director of Strive Sponsorship, spoke about the deal. He explained that the highly competitive global gambling industry makes it increasingly important to engage customers. Through Strive’s premium content, companies can attract and retain customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, Minns said that his team feels honored to be entrusted with developing longer-form content for Smarkets News and SBK Betting Zone. He noted that this attests to the supreme quality of Strive Sponsorship’s services.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be entrusted with developing longer-form content for both the Smarkets exchange and SBK sportsbook app is testament to the high quality and versatile team we have and our ability to deliver specialist content agency services. Malph Minns, managing director, Strive Sponsorship</p>
<p>Smarkets Is Glad to Have Strive by Its Side</p>
<p>Adam Baylis, the head of customer marketing for Smarkets, also shared his thoughts on the deal. He shared that his company is excited to bring talented Strive writers to its site. Baylis explained that this aligns with Smarkets’ mission to be a leading source of information when it comes to sports.</p>
<p>Strive was the obvious partner to help us deliver this vision given their great team and strong understanding of sport, betting markets, engaging digital content, and their consistently high level of delivery over a number of years. Adam Baylis, head of customer marketing, Smarkets</p>
<p>Baylis explained that the new deal will help Smarkets improve its coverage. According to him, Smarkets News will closely follow the developments in sports and will provide unique angles of the latest news in the sector. Thanks to the deal with Strive, Smarkets will be able to engage fans of sports and sports betting alike.</p>
<p>Smarkets continues to expand across the sports betting sector. A few days ago, the company announced its plans to join the Iowa betting market.</p>
