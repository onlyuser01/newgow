<p>The retail sportsbook that will be available for punters to place their bets will be only a temporary solution, as the construction of the permanent sportsbook is already underway. The state-of-the-art sports betting facility, once finished, will comprise of a large feature bar, an expansive wall of TVs, as well as a VIP Lounge access area.</p>

DraftKings and Mardi Gras Casino are committed to providing a safe, immersive and entertaining gaming environment to ensure sports fans in Colorado have the most enjoyable experience possible.” Ezra Kucharz, Chief Business Officer, DraftKings</p>
<p>Mardi Gras Casino is operated by the Rhode Island-based Twin River Worldwide Holdings, and the gaming company has a partnership deal in place with DraftKings. In March the Limited Gaming Control Commission, the regulatory body in Colorado, issued 2 licenses to DraftKings, one for retail sports betting and one for online operations, the retail sportsbook intended for the Mardi Gras Casino.</p>
<p>“This partnership with DraftKings allows us to provide an unmatched sports betting experience to Coloradans, not only with their mobile betting access, but also with this exciting DraftKings retail sportsbook location. We are looking forward to introducing our guests to the fully renovated space in the coming months and until that time, are glad to be able to give our guests the ability to safely start placing bets as many professional sports begin to resume in the coming weeks.” George Papanier, President and CEO, Twin River Worldwide Holdings</p>
<p>DraftKings’ online sportsbook was one of four, along with FanDuel‘s, BetMGM‘s, and BetRivers‘ with which the Rocky Mountain State went officially live with sports betting by the end of April. Both DraftKings and FanDuel launched their sports betting operations in partnership with Twin River Holdings.</p>
