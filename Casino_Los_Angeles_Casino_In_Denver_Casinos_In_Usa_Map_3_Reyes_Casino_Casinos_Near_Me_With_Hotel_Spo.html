<p>BetMGM, SportsGrid Bolster Partnership Ahead of Football Season</p>

<p>Just in time for the 2022 football season, BetMGM and SportsGrid said today they’re expanding their partnership announced earlier this year.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the broadened accord weren’t revealed. Currently, the gaming company’s content will be featured across SportsGrid’s original, live programming and enhanced by social media and television advertising.</p>
<p>Under the multi-year agreement BetMGM’s trading team and experts will provide insight during various broadcasts including Ferrall Coast to Coast, Pro Football Today and In-Game Live Primetime,” according to a statement issued by the companies.</p>
<p>Additionally, Warren Sharp — SportsGrid’s lead NFL analyst — will deliver updates from various MGM integrated resorts. MGM National Harbor in Maryland is the only specific venue identified in the press release.</p>
<p>BetMGM, SportsGrid Ideal Match</p>
<p>SportsGrid is the only 24-hour sports wagering streaming network in the US.</p>
<p>The media entity already features multiple sports wagering programs on its radio network. For example, The Morning After is a dedicated wagering show, while the popular Ferrall Coast to Coast frequently delves into betting chatter, particularly during football season. College Football Full Circle, a podcast by Mike Carver and Joe Lisi, focuses on NCAA football wagering.</p>
<p>“BetMGM’s odds and promotions will now be featured throughout the entirety of Ferrall Coast to Coast. Sharp’s live reports also will be distributed over SportsGrid’s multi-media content platforms, including the video streaming network, website, digital syndication publisher network and both companies’ social media properties,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>BetMGM is currently live in 16 states, Washington, DC, and Ontario, Canada. The operator also has market access in Florida, Kansas, Maryland, and Ohio, among others, according to its website.</p>
<p>Sports Betting, Media Deals Continue Piling Up</p>
<p>Sportsbook operators and media companies continue to expand partnerships, and BetMGM and SportsGrid are just one example. Earlier this month, SportsGrid announced it is airing on FuboTV.</p>
<p>Last December, FanDuel, the largest online sportsbook operator in the US, reached a deal reportedly worth $30 million with the Pat McAfee Show, which airs on SportsGrid’s streaming platform. The statement issued by BetMGM and SportsGrid doesn’t mention that arrangement.</p>
<p>Last year, Macquarie Research forecast more than $30 billion worth of iGaming and sports wagering revenue by 2030, attributable to accords with media companies. The research firm estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33&amp; over the coming years for online casino and sportsbook operators through agreements with media companies.</p>
<p>When it comes to the combination of sportsbooks and media entities, the elephant in the room remains if and when ESPN will make a notable move — potentially an acquisition — to bolster its footprint in the sports wagering industry.</p>
