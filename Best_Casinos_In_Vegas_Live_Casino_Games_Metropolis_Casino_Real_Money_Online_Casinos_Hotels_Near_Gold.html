<p>Low6 free-to-play games are expected to boost fan engagement and activate revenue for the NHL and its commercial partners</p>
<p>The National Hockey League (NHL) announced it has entered into a new partnership with sports gamification expert, Low6, to enhance fan experiences and popularize its product.</p>
<p>Shared Values of Engagement and Innovation</p>
<p>Under the collaboration, Low6 became an official free-to-play gaming provider of the NHL and its free-to-play games are seen as second-screen interactive experiences bringing shared values of fan engagement and digital innovation that can help the league captivate more fans of ice hockey globally.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Low6 co-founder and chief executive officer, Jamie Mitchell, outlined the company’s plans for the near future, thrilled to see the platform being selected by the NHL as the league’s provider of free-to-play games.</p>
<p>“Over the next two years, we will be providing highly innovative games, actionable data and a whole heap of fun for users,” Mitchell said, emphasizing that Low6’s gamification suite will benefit the league and its commercial partners by “activating revenue.”</p>
<p>Low6 launched its first free-to-play NHL game, NHL PrePlay, in partnership with Canadian-based online sportsbook operator BET99 in December, asking hockey fans in Canada to provide answers to a set of questions linked to the outcome of the matches throughout each game day of the NHL season, competing for a chance to win C$100,000 ($73,800), weekly ticket giveaways and NHL shop gift cards.</p>
<p>Included in BET99’s marketing communications, the free-to-play game helps BET99 receive brand exposure and facilitates its objective to provide betting education to its users.</p>
<p>Another NHL free-to-play game produced by Low6 is the Pepsi Zero Sugar NHL Goalie Challenge in which fans are asked to choose three goalies from the NHL and match them with one of three options: getting a win, racking up the most saves or having the fewest goals scored against them. With an interactive element to it, the game allows players to drop cans of Pepsi on which goaltender they thought would earn a shutout.</p>
<p>Free-to-Play NHL Games</p>
<p>Half a dozen new NHL free-to-play games were launched by Low6 in the past three months, including NHL Stats Streak presented by SAP, NHL Winter Classic, NHL Stadium Series, NHL All-Star Bingo, the 2023 NHL All-Star Fan Vote presented by Guaranteed Rate, and 2023 Stanley Cup Playoffs Bracket Challenge presented by Geico.</p>
<p>A new NHL game is already down the pipeline, the 2023 Stanley Cup Final Bingo, and will soon be launched by the sports gamification expert.</p>
<p>Outside of hockey, Low6 has been producing free-to-play games for other sports, including basketball, soccer, and even esports, actively supporting its partners to engage with their fan bases through gamification.</p>
