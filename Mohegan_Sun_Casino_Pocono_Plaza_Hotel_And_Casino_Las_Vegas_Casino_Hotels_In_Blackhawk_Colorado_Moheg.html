    <h1>Mohegan Sun Casino Pocono Plaza Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino Hotels In Blackhawk Colorado Moheg</h1>

<p>The topflight women’s basketball league has become the latest organization to join the trade group’s public service campaign</p>
<p>“Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” is a campaign that is run by the American Gaming Association in a bid to boost awareness for regulated and responsible gambling websites and practices.</p>
<p>Delivering Responsible Gambling Messaging to Basketball Fans</p>
<p>The campaign has been running over the past several years and features a number of prominent partners, such as operators and sports leagues with the Women’s National Basketball Association being the latest prominent member of the initiative.</p>
<p>As a result, the WNBA will work hard to educate fans about responsible gambling and seek assistance from all of its 12 participating teams to amplify the campaign’s message.</p>
<p>This will happen through in-venue, digital, social media, and broadcast content as well as through web and in-app integrations with various online assets owned by the WNBA and its teams. Commenting on this new opportunity, WNBA chief growth officer Colie Edison said:</p>
<p>Legal sports betting has opened the door for deeper engagement with our league. As we explore this new avenue, the WNBA is committed to ensuring those who choose to wager on our league have the knowledge and tools to do so responsibly. WNBA chief growth officer Colie Edison</p>
<p>There will be various activations as part of the campaign, helping to make fans aware of responsible gambling practices with the launch of the season on Friday, May 19, seeing a number of such initiatives take place. AGA SVP Casey Clark was happy to see the Have A Game Plan expand with yet another committed member.</p>
<p>Reaching the Market’s Broad Group of Diverse Participants</p>
<p>Boosting the campaign’s voice with existing basketball audiences was an important goal for the company. Clark added:</p>
<p>As legal sports betting matures across America, reaching the market’s broad group of diverse participants will require exactly the kind of leadership the WNBA, NBA, and all of our Have A Game Plan partners have shown. AGA SVP Casey Clark</p>
<p>Have A Game Plan has collaborated with a number of other organizations in a bid to make sports fans aware of the best practices when engaging with sports wagering.</p>
<p>Those other organizations include Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, NASCAR, and numerous teams, such as the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, Vegas Golden Knights, and operators, to name BetMGM, Bally’s, Barstool Sportsbook, BetPARX, and others.</p>
