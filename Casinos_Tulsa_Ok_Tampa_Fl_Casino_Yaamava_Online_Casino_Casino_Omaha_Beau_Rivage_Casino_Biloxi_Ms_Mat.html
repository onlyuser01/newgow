<p>Now, Wolff has positioned himself to go from long-shot contender to the youngest U.S. Open champion since the legendary Bobby Jones in 1923.</p>
<p>On the strength of five birdies on the front nine, the 21-year-old Wolff shot a 5-under 65 on Saturday at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., to surge to the top of the leaderboard ahead of Sunday’s final round.</p>
<p>Bombs Away</p>
<p>Wolff only hit two fairways, but did everything else right, as he beat the field scoring average by a whopping 8.6 strokes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Wolff opens Sunday as one of only three players under par for the 120th edition of the championship. He’ll be paired with Bryson DeChambeau, who is two shots back at 3 under. They will tee off at 1:30 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of holes out there, that maybe people would try to hit it in the fairway or maybe take the safe play, because it is a U.S. Open and they know that pars are a good score. But I don’t really like to think of it that way,” Wolff told reporters. “I like to go out there and do what I feel comfortable with, rip dog, and see how it goes from there. I feel comfortable with every part of my game, so I don’t like to shy away from things when I’m feeling confident, and I’m probably going to do the same [Sunday].”</p>
<p>Wolff, with one career win, opened the tournament at 80/1 to win at Westgate SuperBook, and was 30/1 entering Saturday’s third round. He’s now at 7/4. DeChambeau is 9/4. They are the clear front-runners, with Xander Schauffele the distant third choice at 8/1.</p>
<p>Who Else?</p>
<p>Wolff’s lead isn’t huge, but there’s not exactly a lot of players within striking distance, either. DeChambeau is 3 under, Louis Oosthuizen is 1 under, and Schauffele, Hideki Matsuyama, and Harris English are tied for fourth at even.</p>
<p>According to SuperBook’s Jeff Sherman, there are bets of $2,400 on Schauffele at 20/1 and $1,000 on DeChambeau at 20/1. As the final round got under way, Sherman said Wolff, Oosthuizen and Matsuyama were receiving the public support.</p>
<p>“I bet you I’m probably going to be a little antsy,” Wolff said. “It’s the U.S. Open, and I have a lead. I’m going to try to keep my nerves as calm as they can be and not really try to think about it.”</p>
<p>Patrick Reed and Justin Thomas joined DeChambeau as the 9/2 favorites entering Saturday’s third round. However, Reed shot a 77 and is 3 over, and Thomas shot a 76 and is 4 over. Both enter Sunday at 100/1 at SuperBook. Tracking the right way is Rory McIlroy. He was 40/1 entering Saturday, but shot a 68 to move to 1 over and within six shots of Wolff. He enters Sunday at 12/1.</p>
<p>“If I go out there tomorrow and shoot another 68,” McIlroy said, “I won’t be too far away.”</p>
<p>Final-Round Odds</p>
<p>Here are the betting leaders at SuperBook, with scores in relation to par in parentheses. Matthew Wolff (-5) 7/4</p>
<p>Bryson DeChambeau (-3) 9/4</p>
<p>Xander Schauffele (E) 8/1</p>
<p>Louis Oosthuizen (-1) 10/1</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy (+1) 12/1</p>
<p>Hideki Matsuyama (E) 16/1</p>
<p>Harris English (E) 25/1</p>
<p>Viktor Hovland (+2) 60/1</p>
<p>Webb Simpson (+3) 80/1</p>
<p>Justin Thomas (+4) 100/1</p>
<p>Patrick Reed (+3) 100/1</p>
<p>Rafa Cabrera Bello (+2) 150/1</p>
<p>Zach Johnson (+2) 150/1</p>
<p>Joaquin Niemann (+3) 150/1</p>
<p>Thomas Pieters (+3) 150/1</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson (+5) 200/1</p>
<p>Absent from that list? Phil Mickelson, who received a noteworthy bet, and Tiger Woods, who garnered the lion’s share of the bets. Both players missed the cut.</p>
<p>At FanDuel, the bet on the winning score is -126 for 2 under or worse and -108 for 3 under or better.</p>
