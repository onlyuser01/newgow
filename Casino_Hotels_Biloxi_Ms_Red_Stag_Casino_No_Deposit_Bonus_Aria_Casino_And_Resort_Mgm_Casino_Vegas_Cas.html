    <h1>Casino Hotels Biloxi Ms Red Stag Casino No Deposit Bonus Aria Casino And Resort Mgm Casino Vegas Cas</h1>

<p>Vincent Group brand Coolbet has become the latest gambling company to join the International Betting and Integrity Association or IBIA for short. The leading North American B2B and B2C igaming company will be an important ally as IBIA continues to oversee the global gambling industry in an attempt to rid it of corruption.</p>
<p>Coolbet Fully Committed to IBIA Mission Statement</p>
<p>Coolbet has recently received a license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario AGCO and will now be available as an authorized gambling partner in the Canadian province. Coolbet has licenses in Malta, Sweden, and Estonia and is one of the biggest igaming and sports betting companies in the world.</p>
<p>Presently, IBIA’s members process an estimated total value of €115 billion or approximately $122 billion per annum. All of this amount is wagered in regulated markets. Welcoming the partnership, GAN Limited SVP of global sports Endre Nesset welcomed the opportunity that Coolbet has been recognized by IBIA as a trustworthy partner.</p>
<p>GAN acquired Vincent Group back in 2021. Commenting on this opportunity, Nesset explained:</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to be part of the IBIA. There is strength in numbers and power in unity, and together with the rest of IBIA’s members we are in great position to help maintain the integrity and stop foul play in our industry.” GAN Limited SVP of global sports Endre Nesset</p>
<p>IBIA remains one of the strongest proponents of a sports gambling industry that is free of corruption and underhand practices. All members who join IBIA, many of which operate in multiple realms of the gambling experience, are fully committed to assisting IBIA in discovering suspicious betting patterns and acting against those with the help of law enforcement and sports bodies.</p>
<p>More Trustworthy and Reliable Partners</p>
<p>IBIA has been actively trying to expand the reach of its partner list, realizing that the organization will do just as well as the higher the number of partners it has. Videoslots, a popular sport and igaming brand also joined earlier in May in a bid to bolster the association’s efforts against corruption. Other recent additions include VBet, an established sports gambling brand that is committed to upholding the company’s mission statement.</p>
