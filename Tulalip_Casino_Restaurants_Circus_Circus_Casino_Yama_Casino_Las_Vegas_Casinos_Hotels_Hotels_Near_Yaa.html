<p>The Philippines is looking to expand its online gambling industry with poker bumped to the top of the country’s regulator list of growth avenues</p>
<p>To this end, PAGCOR, which regulates POGOs and gambling in the country, has announced plans to overhaul the existing regulatory framework. This was confirmed by the watchdog’s chairman and chief executive Alejandro Tengco who said that regulated online poker is one of the verticals to be introduced moving forward.</p>
<p>Tengco Outlines Plans for Online Gambling in the Philippines</p>
<p>The reveal was made during the G2E Asia Conference in Macau attended by Asgam, a leading media in the region, which reported exclusively on the updates that are set to take place in the Philippines over the coming months and years.</p>
<p>According to the publication, Tengco outlined a future for gambling in the country in which slot machine standards are elevated, but there are also opportunities to explore sports betting, eBilliards, eCasino, and eBingo games. This comes at a strange time as the Philippines has oft been criticizing the current state of affairs in the POGO sector, the offshore gaming operators which have come under bad-mouthing from local lawmakers and international politicians.</p>
<p>However, Tengco and PAGCOR seem to be moving forward with those plans, with online gaming and poker part of the expected big changes in the markets. This comes on the tail of already successfully completed projects, such as an update to the regulatory manual for POGOs to follow.</p>
<p>POGOs Set to Be Part of Gambling Future</p>
<p>PAGCOR will now strengthen its hold over the POGO sector and make sure to act in those instances of non-compliance that necessitate a tougher response. POGOs have been lambasted for their alleged involvement with human trafficking and operating without paying taxes or applying for licenses.</p>
<p>The sector has become an apple of discord for the Philippines with China exercising its diplomatic charm offensive to pressure the country into clamping down on the sector. However, Tengco seems committed to pushing forward with expanding the sector and introducing online poker, on top of all other iGaming verticals.</p>
