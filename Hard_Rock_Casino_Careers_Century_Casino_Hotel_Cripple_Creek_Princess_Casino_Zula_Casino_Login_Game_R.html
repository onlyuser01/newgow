<p>The leading developer and supplier of solutions for the iGaming industry, Greentube, announced a key business-to-business (B2B) partnership. The company said Wednesday that it expanded its North American footprint by joining forces with the exclusive sports betting partner to MGM Resorts nationwide, BetMGM.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Greentube, the NOVOMATIC Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, and BetMGM applies to the regulated market in Michigan. Under the terms of the new partnership, BetMGM customers in the state will be able to enjoy leading Greentube games such as Mighty Emperor, Mighty Elephant, Mighty Sevens and the highly popular series Diamond Cash.</p>
<p>David Bolas, Greentube's Commercial Director, commented on the topic in a statement released on August 31, 2022. He said that the company's team is excited about the launch in Michigan with BetMGM. Bolas deemed the partnership as important and added: "The US and Michigan in particular are key territories for Greentube." Last but not least, Greentube's Commercial Director pointed out: "It's another very important step for us in the context of the wider US market and preparations for launching in Pennsylvania are already underway."</p>
<p>The newly announced collaboration isn't the first partnership between the duo. In fact, earlier this year, Greentube and BetMGM joined forces for the regulated market in New Jersey, one of the most important US gambling markets. As a result, Greentube launched its portfolio of popular games via the iGaming operator.</p>
<p>It was back in January 2021 when Greentube rolled out its online gambling operations in the Great Lake State. Then, early in February this year, the company received its Michigan license. This enabled the leading iGaming content provider to forge partnerships with operators in the state.</p>
<p>Now the new collaboration with BetMGM marks a milestone moment for the company. The new deal for the market in Michigan complements Greentube's plan to expand its portfolio to all key regulated gambling markets in the US.</p>
<p>Besides its entry into the regulated market in Michigan, recently, Greentube revealed it received World Lottery Association (WLA) supplier certification for its leading omni-channel solution Plurius. The prestigious certification confirms the company's commitment to risk management and security of its products and systems. Effectively, the certification allows Greentube to join forces with WLA members including some of the leading lottery operators around the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Greentube is among the leading providers of tailored and classic iGaming content for customers in different parts of the globe. The leading provider offers secure and safe casino entertainment. Its portfolio of products includes table games, video poker games, classic slots, video bingo games and many more casino-style games.</p>
