<p>Sporttrade has become the latest organization to join the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). The company, which operates out of Philadelphia in the United States, is a sports betting technology firm that delivers advanced platforms facilitating the work of operators in the newly regulated sports wagering market.</p>
<p>IBIA Welcomes Sporttrade’s Addition to List of Members</p>
<p>The company’s decision to join IBIA’s member list reflects a stronger commitment to making sure that fraud in sports contests is kept to a minimum. Sporttrade cares about integrity a lot as it offers an innovative sports betting product whereby players in New Jersey can create and trade wagers much like they would do stock options or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Sporttrade is joining a strong club of sports betting companies, sports leagues, and associations all of which are committed to building a more resilient and transparent wagering industry. IBIA’s partner account for an annual sports gambling handle of $137 billion annually, and account for close to 50% of all regulated online betting.</p>
<p>Sporttrade CEO and company founder Alex Kane were naturally excited to have the opportunity to push the firm into the orbit of IBIA partners. He commented on the new membership, saying:</p>
<p>We are proud to be an IBIA member as it cements our mission of elevating the sports betting industry. We are committed to advancing fair, transparent, and efficient open sports betting markets. Our membership in the IBIA and our utilization of industry-leading technology, like Nasdaq’s market surveillance, is critical to achieving that promise. Sporttrade CEO and company founder Alex Kane</p>
<p>IBIA CEO Khalid Ali was equally delighted with the opportunity to welcome a strong operator in North America as part of the organization. According to Ali, Sporttrade membership will significantly extend the organization’s ability to survey the regional market and serve as a custodian of fair wagering options. So far, IBIA members account for 70% of all online gambling revenue.</p>
<p>IBIA Strengthens Reach in North American Market</p>
<p>Sporttrade’s addition dovetails nicely with the existing operating capacity of IBIA and its partner in North America, as the US sports betting market continues to grow. IBIA is firmly committed to promoting integrity across the regulated gambling industry and has been calling on operators and official sports bodies to join forces so they can take concerted efforts to stop the corruption in sports and guarantee the fairness of sports contests at a time when the offshore gambling market is declining but match-fixers are proliferating, nevertheless.</p>
