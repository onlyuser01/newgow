    <h1>Casinos In Vicksburg Mississippi Casino North Carolina Thunder Valley Casino Resort Photos Casino Bo</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, as SlotHub casino, we are really sorry for the problem you have experienced.</p>
<p>When I check the logs, I see that your statements are incorrect and misrepresented.</p>
<p>You stated that you did not violate any bonuses, but as our support team shared before, you violated the bonus rules.</p>
<p>Our bonus policies and terms of use are clearly stated on Slothub. Our players must read them clearly, especially when they use a bonus.</p>
<p>As in every casino, some games are on the prohibited list while they have an active bonus. These casino games are clearly stated on the bonus policies page.</p>
<p>You have violated our bonus policy by playing these games more than once while having an active bonus, and your active bonus and bonus winnings have been canceled for this reason.</p>
<p>Your main deposit has been added back to your account and I am viewing that you have successfully withdrawn it</p>
<p>You have played the following prohibited games with your active bonus and earned profits from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spinions Game Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sizzling Kingdom: Bison</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wolf Gold</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You said you didn't play these games, but your account logs are as follows:</p>

<p>Also last week our promotion team made some changes to our bonuses, but these were related to deposit bonuses. Our bonus rules and policies have always been the same, with no changes made to them that have changed or deceived our players.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about your complaint. It is clear that you have violated the bonus rules, and at Slothub we are particularly clear about our Bonus policies.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Slothub Casino</p>
