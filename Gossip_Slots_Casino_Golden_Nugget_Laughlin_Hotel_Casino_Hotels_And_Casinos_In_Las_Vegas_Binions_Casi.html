    <h1>Gossip Slots Casino Golden Nugget Laughlin Hotel Casino Hotels And Casinos In Las Vegas Binions Casi</h1>

<p>Resorts Digital Gaming has negotiated a new partnership with streaming company and organization Slot Squad. Slot Squad is a collection of streamers who try to present players and online casino fans with more immersive gameplay sessions. The new collaboration will help Resorts Digital Gaming to seek and expand online as it pursues better engagement with players.</p>
<p>Slot Squad to Bring a Refreshing Angle to Online Gaming</p>
<p>Resorts Digital Gaming has a dedicated platform that will now integrate the Slot Squad experience, enabling players to interact and play alongside the streamers. Commenting on this opportunity, Resorts CEO Ed Andrewes explained:</p>
<p>When we opened in 1978, Resorts was the first casino hotel in Atlantic City, and the first legal casino in the United States, outside of Nevada. Resorts CEO Ed Andrewes</p>
<p>Andrewes stressed that innovation has been an important part of the companyâ€™s culture in the years since its launch. Both the slots and table game sectors have proven particularly important. He explained that the launch of resortscasino.com was a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Now, the addition of Slot Squad will guarantee that Resorts continues to expand its digital footprint and do so successfully and with the help of a trusted organization. Building up the digital platform is of the utmost importance to Resorts, Andrewes assured.</p>
<p>Resorts will also proceed with the launch of in-person live streams which will be attended by Slot Squad. Meanwhile, Slot Squad founder David Copeland joined the conversation and said:</p>
<p>This partnership is just the beginning. As we grow together, we look to immerse online casino players into the amazing atmosphere of the original Resorts Casino through a variety of unique initiatives. Slot Squad founder David Copeland</p>
<p>Copeland said that his company was able to bridge the gap between in-person experiences and online gaming and he was happy to be working with Resorts to make this happen. Previously, Resorts Digital bolstered its content offer with Scientific Games and Playtech, looking to reinforce its New Jersey iGaming operations.</p>
