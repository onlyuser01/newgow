    <h1>123 Vegas Casino Alabama Casino Hotels Near Sky River Casino Casino In Flagstaff Mandalay Bay Resort</h1>

<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has partnered with Matching Visions, an affiliate network based in Malta. This new partnership will result in the provision of GiG Comply, a B2B marketing compliance software by GiG. The development comes just several days after GiG extended its partnership with Avento Group for the same product.</p>
<p>Matching Visions Wants to Remain 100% Compliant</p>
<p>While speaking about the newly-formed partnership, the CEO of Matching Visions, Dennis Dyhr-Hansen, stated that it is extremely important for the company to be 100% compliant, regardless of the brand or geo that it sends traffic to.</p>
<p>He also added that Matching Visions’ goal is to be completely transparent with all of its partners and that is the reason why the company takes compliance extremely seriously and will do everything in its power to “be at the forefront of compliance.”</p>
<p>Dyhr-Hansen concluded by saying that Matching Visions is delighted to work with GiG to make that happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CMO of GiG, Jonas Warrer, said that GiG is more than happy to provide support to Matching Visions in terms of increasing its affiliate marketing compliance. Warrer also noted that the demand for GiG Comply has been massive and the fact that so many companies, with Matching Visions being one of them, are looking to implement it shows that they put great value in creating a sustainable gaming movement, one that is extremely responsible. He concluded by saying that this is something that GiG is very proud of.</p>
<p>GiG Comply Helps Operators Promote Their Brands</p>
<p>The automated marketing compliance solution by GiG allows Matching Vision and other affiliate networks and operators to scan websites for any types of code red words. The software analyzes snapshots from various marketing campaigns and gives real-time insight into the content.</p>
<p>Many operators and affiliate networks are now demanding these types of tools due to the fact that the online gaming/betting industry has become more regulated in every country around the world.</p>
<p>That is also the case with the US. After the Supreme Court deemed PASPA as unconstitutional in 2018, states gained the power to regulate online betting and online gaming however they please. More than 20 states have legalized online betting since then and online gambling is legal in Delaware, New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Original projections stated that the online wagering industry in the US will make $12.2 billion by 2025, however, a recent analysis conducted by Joseph Greff, a J.P. Morgan analyst, concluded that the industry’s growth will be much bigger than that. One of the reasons why is the recent launch of online betting and online gambling in Connecticut.</p>
