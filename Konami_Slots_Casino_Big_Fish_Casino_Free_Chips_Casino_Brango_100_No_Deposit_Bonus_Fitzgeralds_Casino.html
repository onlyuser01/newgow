<p>Goldberg will operate from BCLC's offices in Vancouver and Kamloops in his new role</p>
<p>British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), the corporation conducting gambling on behalf of the province of British Columbia, announced it has appointed Mark Goldberg as its new Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Vice President of Business Technology.</p>
<p>Support Operations, Grow Tech</p>
<p>The appointment of Goldberg as CIO and VP of Business Technology effective January 23, 2023, is set to bring more than two decades of information technology industry experience and transformation leadership to BCLC to support operations across lottery, casino, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Pat Davis, president and chief executive officer of BCLC, was pleased to welcome Goldberg to the team at BCLC, hailing his “demonstrated success in leveraging information technology to grow and scale business objectives for global companies,” convinced that Goldberg’s credentials will contribute to work aimed at delivering “truly exceptional player experiences.”</p>
<p>Goldberg will be positioned in BCLC’s office in Vancouver but will have to travel regularly to the company’s head office in Kamloops where more than a third of BCLC’s Business Technology division employees are based as continuing the company’s commitment to growing its tech sector presence will be his key responsibility.</p>
<p>“This is a key role, as technology truly underpins every facet of our business,” said Davis, highlighting the overarching nature of technology spanning across “the systems that enable the purchase and validation of lottery tickets, … the complex network of slot machines” at BCLC’s casinos and community gaming centers, and providing the infrastructure of BCLC’s regulated gambling website, PlayNow.</p>
<p>Just days ago, BCLC announced that the PlayNow.com product powered by OpenBet’s Player Account Management (PAM) and sportsbook solutions became available for players in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.</p>
<p>Changes to the Management Team</p>
<p>Goldberg’s most recent role was as Vice President of Information Technology and Global Real Estate and Facilities at the social media management platform Hootsuite, where he had worked for four years. His career also features roles at various companies in the travel and hospitality, consumer products and heavy equipment industries during which he had to develop and enable transformation strategies.</p>
<p>The appointment of Goldberg is the next high-profile addition to the management team at BCLC after the appointment of Davis as President and CEO last year. Davis replaced Lynda Cavanaugh who was a temporary appointment to the role the Board of Directors made at the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>By the time of Davis’ appointment, BCLC Board Chair Greg Moore confirmed two other appointments, Dan Beebe, who joined the company as its new Chief Operating Officer and Sandra Austin, who assumed the role of Chief People Officer.</p>
