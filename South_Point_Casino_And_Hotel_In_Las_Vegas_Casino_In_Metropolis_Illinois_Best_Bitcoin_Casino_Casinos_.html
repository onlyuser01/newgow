<p>Please, I need help, i was scammed by Villageslots, they gave me 25 spins (No Deposit) and i waggered them and i was told to deposit at least $10 , after i deposited $16 I was told to send documents, i sent my ID which was clear and 3 months bank statement that has my Physical address, i was told i was verified just after sending them, i was told to withdraw, i made withdrawal request(refer to the attached screenshot) it was pending for like 5days(which was more than their recommended days) i checked my Account i found that they cancelled the withdrawal,(refer to the attached screenshot) i asked their accounting department what was the reason for cancelling, they told me i had to submit the Ecopayz ID for me to get my money, but i keyed it in during the withdrawal in the first place, i took the screenshot of my ecopayz showing my ecopayz accoung ID,(refer to the attached proof screenshot) i sent them they told me my withdrawal will be reviewed 2 days from that time, i waited for that 2 days, and there was nothing, i sent them an email asking why did i not get anything, they said they have technical errors that was where i realised i was scammed, even now i still have not gotten anything, please help me get my money back, villageslots scammed me. And i do not think they deserve to be licenced since they are defrauding innocent people.</p>
