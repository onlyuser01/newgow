    <h1>The Commerce Casino Hotel Telegraph Road Commerce Ca L Auberge Hotel Casino Lake Charles L Auberge C</h1>

<p>The global gaming and entertainment company, Hard Rock International, together with the only federally recognized Tribe in Kern County, California, the Tejon Indian Tribe, celebrated the groundbreaking of the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon, a new gaming, hospitality and entertainment venue located on Tejon Tribal land. The new hotel and casino property will be located at Hwy. 166 and Sabodan Road West of the community of Mettler.</p>
<p>The celebratory groundbreaking event included Tejon Indian Tribe leaders and members, local community leaders, as well as representatives of Hard Rock. At the event, nearly two dozen people held commemorative shovels, breaking the ground for the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon.</p>
<p>The new premier hotel and casino location is expected to use 700,000 square feet. From that total, the gaming space will take 150,000 square feet, offering 48 table games, video poker machines, as well as 2,500 of some of the most popular slots. Additional amenities at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon are expected to include a Rock Shop, the Council Oak Steaks and Seafood, a fine dining restaurant, as well as signature Hard Rock Cafe and a Rock Shop. Those amenities, along with others are expected to become available with the completion of phase one of the ambitious project some 22 months after the groundbreaking.</p>
<p>Then, phase two of the project is expected to take another 20 months to complete, rounding out the complete hotel and casino. With the second phase of the project, the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon is expected to bring a hotel with 400 rooms, a cigar lounge, a spa, a pool and additional dining outlets. Moreover, the new casino and hotel is expected to offer a Hard Rock Live event venue that can be used for entertainment activities such as sports events and concerts.</p>
<p>Jim Allen, Hard Rock International's Chairman, commented on the topic in a statement explaining: "Hard Rock is proud to partner with the Tejon Indian Tribe on creating a world-class entertainment destination." Additionally, he pointed out: "The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tejon property will be another incredible offering in our West Coast portfolio and we are committed to supporting the local community and creating a lasting positive economic impact for the State of California."</p>
<p>Octavio Escobedo, III Chair of the Tejon Indian Tribe, added: "This is an exciting day for the state of California, Kern County and the Tejon Indian Tribe." Finally, he spoke about the importance of the project for the Tribe and thanked the local government, California's State Legislature, Governor Gavin Newsom, Hard Rock International and other organizations for their vital support.</p>
