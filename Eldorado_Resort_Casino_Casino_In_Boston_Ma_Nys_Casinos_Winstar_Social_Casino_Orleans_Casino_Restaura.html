<p>The gambling regulator in New Jersey, the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE), released its latest report outlining the performance of licensed sports betting, internet gaming and casino operators in October.</p>
<p>DGE Releases October Report</p>
<p>The total gaming revenue reported by racetracks, casinos and their partners last month hit $445.7 million. Although this was a strong month, still, the results marked a slight 0.7% decrease when compared to the $448.7 million reported for the corresponding period in 2021.</p>
<p>While the total gaming revenue last month did not surpass the result from 2021, this was not the case for year-to-date results. DGE’s latest report reveals that year-to-date total revenue reported by licensed operators in hit $4.32 billion. When compared to the same period in 2021, this year, a strong growth of 10.8% is observed.</p>
<p>Last month, the taxes paid by operators hit $45.5 million. This marked a slight decrease when compared to the $45.8 million in taxes reported for October 2021. On the other hand, year-to-date taxes increased hitting $432.9 million until the end of October this year. In contrast, for the same period last year, taxes were $396.8 million.</p>
<p>Casino, Sports Betting Revenue Decreases</p>
<p>A breakdown of the $445.7 million in revenue shows that casino operations were responsible for the majority of revenue or $220.6 million. When compared to the $237.5 million reported in casino win from the same period in 2021, this year, a decrease of 7.1% is observed. Not unexpectedly, a breakdown of the casino win shows further decreases. Slots machine win last month hit $166.2 million while table game win hit $54.4 million, down 7.3% and 6.6% respectively.</p>
<p>The sports wagering revenue last month decreased as well hitting $77.9 million, down 7.4%. This comes as no surprise, considering that the betting handle this October decreased significantly. The total sports betting handle last month was $1.06 billion, down by nearly 19% from the $1.30 billion reported in October last year.</p>
<p>In contrast to the reported declines, the total internet gaming win increased last month. In total, the internet gaming win hit $147.2 million this October, up 15.9% when compared to the $127 million reported in October last year. A further breakdown of this result shows that peer-to-peer revenue decreased by 8.2% to $2.2 million.
