<p>Inter to Miss a Couple of Key Men</p>
<p>Inter’s second-most expensive player, Nicolo Barella, is out due to a red card suspension. Inter’s fourth-most expensive player, Alessandro Bastoni, is also out for a suspension. On top of that, this team will also miss Robin Gosens, Matias Vecino, and Joaquin Correa, all of whom are injured.</p>
<p>Most of those guys have been away for a couple of games, but that didn’t stop Inter from playing well. After losing to AC Milan in Derby Della Madonnina in Serie A, Inter beat AS Roma in the Italian Cup.</p>
<p>Inter’s most recent game took place last Saturday when we saw them play a 1-1 draw with Napoli at Estadio Diego Armando Maradona in Naples.</p>
<p>When it comes to games played at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, Inter has lost only two games this season.</p>
<p>Liverpool Playing Elite Soccer in 2022</p>
<p>Liverpool has lost only two games this season in all competitions. Both of those defeats happened on the road. Still, that shouldn’t worry the Reds too much as they’ve been playing fantastic soccer since the start of the year.</p>
<p>In 2022, Liverpool is without a single loss, with seven wins and two draws. The best thing is that six of those victories happened in their previous six games.</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s boys have been in fantastic form, all of them! Of 24 Liverpool players who played at least one EPL game this season, 15 have scored at least one goal. Their top scorer is Mohamed Salah, who many believe is the best player in the world in 2022.</p>
<p>Salah has scored 23 goals in all competitions, but 22 of those happened in 2021. Since January 2, Salah hasn’t scored a single goal for Liverpool. Is it time for him to end the goal drought?</p>
<p>It sure seems like it! Salah definitely has the skills to score against Inter, and so do his teammates – Sadio Mane, Diogo Jota, and others.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to Win; Over 2.5 Goals</p>
