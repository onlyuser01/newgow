<p>Nottingham Forest and Manchester United meet in the semifinal of the 2022-23 Carabao Cup. The first leg is taking place at City Ground in Nottingham, on Wednesday, January 25</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest should really feel good about themselves after getting to the Top 4 of the Carabao Cup. It’s fair to say that not even their biggest fans expected the Tricky Trees to get this far. The big question is whether they can get even one step further.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers don’t think so. They see Manchester United as a huge favorite not only to win this match but also to win the trophy at Wembley in February.</p>

<p>Nottingham Looking for Their 1st Win Over Man United in 28+ Years</p>
<p>December 17, 1994 – that’s the date when Nottingham Forest defeated Manchester United the last time. Truth be told, the two haven’t met too many times since. In fact, they played only one competitive game so far in the 21st century.</p>
<p>It happened in the Premier League last December when we saw the Red Devils triumph 3-0 at Old Trafford. This game, however, is played on Nottingham’s turf, but will it mean much?</p>
<p>It might be because Nottingham players tend to show up when playing at City Ground. Actually, they’re without a single loss at home since September 2022. Still, they’re yet to welcome such a strong opponent as Man United.</p>
<p>Manchester United Craving for Silverware</p>
<p>It’s been nearly six years since the last time Manchester United won a trophy. In 2023, the Red Devils are still in the contest for several titles, but the one that seems the easiest to win is the Carabao Cup.</p>
<p>They’re the biggest favorite to win the trophy, and it’s not just because they’re in top shape at the moment. It’s also because the other three teams just aren’t as strong as them – Nottingham, Southampton, and Newcastle.</p>
<p>We think it’s almost 100% certain Erik Ten Haag’s team will go for a win in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semifinal. This way, they wouldn’t have to worry much about what’s going to happen in the rematch one week later.</p>
<p>Another reason why they want to win on Wednesday is to get back on the winning track. Their 10-game undefeated run (9 wins and one draw) in all competitions ended last Sunday when EPL table leaders Arsenal beat them 3-2.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United Prediction</p>
<p>The last time these two played in Nottingham, the visitors won 8-1. Still, that was a very, very long time ago – back in 1999. This time, we don’t expect such a demolition job, but we do think Man United will record another dominant win.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester United to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
