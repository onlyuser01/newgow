<p>Responsible gambling is in the key of everything Betsson Group does, head of responsible gambling at the company, Eduards Jakubovs, said cited by CasinoBeats.</p>
<p>Betsson’s Commitment to Responsible Gambling Remains Intact</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity to be part of the Safer Gambling Week, Betsson Group continues to be an echelon for responsible gambling efforts, as confirmed by Head of Responsible Gambling Eduards Jakubovs, cited by CasinoBeats.</p>
<p>Discussing the future of responsible gambling, Jakubovs confirmed Betsson’s unequivocal stance on responsible gambling vowing support for the initiative. Betsson, Jakubovs explained, was always in favor of supporting initiatives that help educate staff and the general public about responsible gambling.</p>
<p>He confirmed that Betsson has been adapting its offer and securing the necessary tools to identify problem gambling behavior and uproot it completely. Betsson’s main focus now remains on recreational players who visit Betsson brands for purely entertainment purposes, Jakubovs added.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the Safer Gambling Week, Betsson had launched an e-learning course covering the basics of responsible gambling. The training was carried out by Sustainable Interaction, a recognized industry expert in the area of responsible gambling, Jakubovs said.</p>
<p>Responsible gambling initiatives such as SGW have been ongoing for years now, with the first edition dating back to 2017 and the most recent edition ending on November 25 this year. Overall, more than 100,000 employees at 9,000 gambling establishments have participated in the four-year history of the initiative backed by the likes of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), British Amusement Catering Trade Association, The Bingo Association and others.</p>
<p>Don’t Look for Problem Gamblers, Says Betsson</p>
<p>Jakubovs summed up the key takeaways from responsible gambling initiatives by saying that companies must not be looking for players who are susceptible to gambling products, but rather those who enjoy gambling as a hobby.</p>
<p>Even then, all companies should be working towards educating and raising awareness on safer gambling policies. By holding events such as Safer Gambling Week, Jakubovs and Betsson believe there is an opportunity to broach a national discussion about the dangers of reckless gambling.</p>
<p>What’s more however, the campaign helps operators familiarize themselves with technology, tools and practices that guarantee a safer overall gaming environment for consumers.</p>
<p>Betsson, Jakubovs said, was constantly investing in such solutions to help make the gaming sector a safer place for consumers. The key tenets set out by Safer Gambling Week and similar initiatives are values by which Betsson operates all the time, Jakubovs concluded.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) noted that underage individual’s exposure to gambling products has declined in the third quarter of the year. Earlier this year, BonusFinder reported that an estimated 94% of players in the United Kingdom were already aware of responsible gambling tools.</p>
<p>When Betsson published its interim report for April-June for 2020, the company called responsible gambling the core of its operations and a prerequisite for long-term sustainable customer relations.</p>
<p>Calls for industry-impacting regulation have been raised in the past, with some proving more disruptive than others. For example, the industry is happy to embrace responsible gambling practices but has been sceptical of some changes.</p>
