    <h1>Wildhorse Hotel And Casino Seneca Niagara Casino Casino In Lake Charles La L Auberge Turtle Lake Cas</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>From what I see Makkan you deposited a free chip, played the chip and made the required playthrough, then made a cash deposit using Bitcoin on top of it. Had there been no free chip in play (cash only) any win would have been free and clear (1x playthrough and no withdrawal limit) but no deposit bonus funds come with extended rules. In this case the rules would be 30x playthrough for slots and keno and $100 maximum cashout. All funds are now mixed and follow the 30x playthrough $100 max withdrawal rules.</p>
<p>You should always refrain from mixing different types of funds within the casino and assure that your playable balance is as close to $0 (below $5) as possible when depositing any kind of money into your casino account.</p>
<p>Once the funds are removed (by playing the funds down or requesting them for withdrawal) then you can move forward. I see also you attempted to deposit more than one no deposit bonus in a row, it's important to note (though not relevant in this case as the bonuses were denied thus not in play) only one no deposit bonus is allowed between cash deposits unless issued directly by the casino itself.</p>
<p>All that said you should be eligible for the majority of the requested withdrawal ($110 requested vs $100 maximum withdrawal), the holdup currently is the documentation you have submitted doesn't line up. The bank statement you submitted with proof of address has a different physical address than the registered address in your casino account, that is creating your current issue and preventing your casino account from being verified. Also a valid method of withdrawal needs to be submitted.</p>
<p>One of my agents will reach out to you momentarily via email to assist you Makkan, just communicate and follow their instructions and we will see if we can't get things moving for you.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Nick and Captain Jack</p>
