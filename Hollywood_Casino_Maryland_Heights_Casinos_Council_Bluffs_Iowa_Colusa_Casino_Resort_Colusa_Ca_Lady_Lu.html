    <h1>Hollywood Casino Maryland Heights Casinos Council Bluffs Iowa Colusa Casino Resort Colusa Ca Lady Lu</h1>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>I have been playing on this site since January, 2021.</p>
<p>I have raised concerns about this particular house game possibly having a bug around the time the site was completely updated in October, 2022. There would be multiple times over multiple sessions where the house would win 15-20 times in a row on the first flip which did not seem right in a game with such a low house edge and a 50/50 chance of winning. However, I was advised to just verify my bets.</p>
<p>I noticed the day I made the screen recording that I lost a previous round despite choosing the option that was verified so I started recording my gameplay to make sure I was not confused and to be able to show the site’s support in case it happened again. It has happened several more times since then but has been dismissed by support.</p>
<p>I most recently contacted the casino last week due to having issues withdrawing my winnings from the site due to various random errors which only began, again, when the site was updated in October, 2022. I have since been advised that this issue has been resolved but I have not tried to withdraw since then as I have not kept enough winnings to meet the minimum withdrawal amount since my previous withdraw attempts.</p>
<p>I have over 2 million bets at this site so I, of course, cannot go back and verify each bet. Despite the small amounts lost on bets that I should’ve won per their own verification tool, these can add up especially if it is happening to others. I do not feel the site owners are intentionally cheating or rigging the system but there’s obviously a bug that they are refusing to acknowledge and fix.</p>
