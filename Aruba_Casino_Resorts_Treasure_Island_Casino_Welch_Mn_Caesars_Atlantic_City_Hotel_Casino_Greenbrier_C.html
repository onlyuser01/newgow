    <h1>Aruba Casino Resorts Treasure Island Casino Welch Mn Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino Greenbrier C</h1>

<p>NuxGame, a business-to-business software company that delivers solutions to the online casino sector, has formed a new alliance with REEVO, which is known for its game aggregation platform, Casino Guru News learned in an email press release. As a result, REEVO’s titles and third-party content will be injected directly into NuxGame’s platform and thus become available to players worldwide through hundreds of partner brands.</p>
<p>REEVO has been building an outstanding variety of games and solutions, bringing its own in-house solutions along with tier-one games by third parties. Presently, the company is adding new suppliers to its aggregation solution monthly and it is growing ambitiously in the sector. REEVO has already confirmed that it will be adding more than 60 game suppliers in 2023 alone and is one of the fastest-growing and most successful companies in the sector.</p>
<p>NuxGame caters to both iGaming and sports betting brands and operators. The platform already has custom-built odds for more than 370,000 sports events every month and it further offers titles by 120 leading suppliers. NuxGame will now leverage REEVO’s portfolio of games while relying on its own advanced platform as well, which includes player engagement and loyalty solutions.</p>
<p>REEVO Head of Sales Petra Maria Poola was pleased to see this partnership between the two companies form. She welcomed the opportunity to have NuxGame, a trusted platform provider, collaborate with REEVO, a leading gaming supplier.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to bring NuxGame's innovative solutions to our platform, enriching our content library and solidifying our position in the iGaming community," Poola added. The deal was also hailed as a success by NuxGame Chief Operating Officer Denis Kosinsky who welcomed the chance to be working with REEVO and help enhance the product offering that his company’s clients came to expect.</p>
<p>REEVO has also been expanding its library of games by adding prominent studios such as Hacksaw Gaming and Stakelogic. REEVO has been determined to surpass its milestone of 60 studios this year, and it has already created a formidable portfolio of third-party studios. As an individual developer, REEVO has also been expanding opportunities to introduce its games to aggregators.</p>
<p>REEVO’s own games focus on slots and table games and they are produced on-site at the company’s studio in Romania. REEVO has developed 50 games of its own, but the company’s portfolio continues to grow monthly.</p>
