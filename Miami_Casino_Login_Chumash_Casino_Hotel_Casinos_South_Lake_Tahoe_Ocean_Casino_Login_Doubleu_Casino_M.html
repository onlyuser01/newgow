<p>Mr. Macau Slot Review</p>
<p>Mr. Macau is another excellent release from Betsoft Gaming that features an Asian theme. The game has found its inspiration in Macau, also known as the Las Vegas of the East located off the coast of mainland China. Known for its 40+ premium casinos including some of the biggest casino resorts on the planet, Macau helped the talented guys at Betsoft design and release the slot with five reels, 20 fixed pay lines that can be easily activated with a single click, and a high Return to Player rate expected to bring players good chances of winning like Macau’s highest rollers.</p>
<p>We have carefully assessed the game’s paytable, special features including Mr. Macau’s Wild Boost, Stick and Respin, Sticky Wilds, and Triple 7 Free Spins, theme, storyline gameplay, sounds, and animations. Keep reading to learn more about the game from our pros.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Join Mr. Macau for a Night on the Town</p>
<p>Players are invited to get ready for a spectacular night out with the inimitable Mr. Macau, exploring Macau’s mesmerizing highlights, glitz, and glam and trying their luck in the undisputable entertainment capital on the Asian continent.</p>
<p>The studio opted for an appealing red and gold backdrop represented by a luxurious casino floor which nicely complements the theme. Since gold and red are the main good luck colors part of Chinese culture, they are oftentimes seen in Chinese casinos, so their presence in Mr. Macau was a mandatory condition that Betsoft successfully respected.</p>
<p>Mr. Macau: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>Players are rewarded with a payout as soon as they land three identical symbols on one of the pay lines part of the paytable, starting with the utmost left side. All symbols are connected to classic symbols you would normally find in any land casino, ranging from Aces through Jacks as the lowest-paying symbols. Payouts start at 0.15x for landing three identical low-paying symbols, followed by 0.45x payouts for four identical symbols, and all the way to 0.90x for five matching symbols. The mid-range symbols pay 0.30x for three symbols landing on the pay lines, 0.90x for four symbols, and 1.80x for five symbols.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cherries, the flaming 7s, the dice, and the chip stacks represent the medium-paying symbols in the game. Players get up to 2.40x for five chip stacks symbols, and 1.80x for five cherry, flaming 7s, and dice symbols.</p>
<p>Mr. Macau along with the gold 88 symbols stand for the most valuable symbols. Mr. Macau pays 3.60x for five symbols while the gold 88 symbol rewards players with a payout of 9x for five matching symbols landing on the pay lines. The game also features starry wild symbols along with bonus scatters marked through the triple 7s signs.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack and all the sound effects have not been chosen randomly. On the contrary, Betsoft has done a good job at opting for a pleasant murmur of the crowds for sound FX and a soothing jazz soundtrack. Players are carried to a playground packed with neon and strobing lights so they can experience some truly unforgettable simmering nights at Macau’s luxurious casino resorts.</p>
<p>Mr. Macau Gameplay</p>
<p>The game has smooth and simple gameplay with easily accessible rules available in the dedicated Rules section found when clicking the “i” tab. The five reels and 20 pay lines keep the action simple. The highest win per every line pays. At the same time, all coinciding wins from different pay lines are added together. When accessing the Settings section, players can easily control the background music, sound effects, and Turbo Play option the best way they see fit. Autoplay mode is also available. Players can select a maximum of 100 auto spins at a total cost of 2,000. The “+” and the “-” signs help players quickly place their bets and start spinning the reels.</p>
<p>Mr. Macau: Free Spins, Sticky Wilds, Wild Boosts &amp; Stick &amp; Respins</p>
<p>While knowing the basics of how to play Mr. Macau is mandatory, it is even more important to know how to win money in the game. While no special skills and strategies are needed, simply crossing one’s fingers for the winning symbols on the reels is not the only way to do it. We recommend players take advantage of the excellent bonus features to significantly increase their chances of winning big.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are plenty of bonus features to watch out for and most of them can be easily triggered while still engaged in the base game. Here is a quick rundown:</p>
<p>Free Spins and Sticky Wild Symbols</p>
<p>The game hosts two special symbols: the wild symbol and the scatter. Both can only be seen on the second, third, fourth, and fifth reels. The wild is represented by a red and gold marquis with the word WILD written on it. Some wilds also feature stars and other symbols above the word WILD, which turns them into sticky wilds.</p>
<p>When a pair of stars show up on top of the wild, the wild will stay there for the following two spins. When just one star is seen on top of the wild, players are only given one sticky wild spin. Wilds are important as they replace the rest of the symbols with the exception of the scatters, even though there are some wilds that feature scatters on top which allows them to successfully replace the scatters.</p>
<p>The scatter symbols are represented by the image of a classic slot machine with three red 7s.</p>
<p>Landing a trio consisting of red seven machine symbols means collecting 10 free spins. Four scatter symbols reward players with ten free spins with multiplier wilds that can go as high as 3x.</p>
<p>While engaged in the free spins round, all wilds will continue to be sticky for the entirety of the feature.</p>
<p>Randomized Bonus Features</p>
<p>The game also comes with two bonus features that can be randomly activated after a spin that has not generated a win.</p>
<p>Wild Boost</p>
<p>Here, players get additional wild symbols for their upcoming spin once they see a gold frame showing around the edge of the reels to prove the feature is activated. While engaged in the base game, players can still be rewarded two or three wilds during a spin. Once the Wild Boost gesture is engaged, players receive five, six, or seven wilds simultaneously.</p>
<p>Stick and Re-spin</p>
<p>When this feature is engaged, it randomly selects a special symbol to turn it into a sticky symbol until the feature ends. Next, the reels are spun again until players earn a payout with the help of the respective special symbols. Big payouts are possible since sticky symbols can be seen lining up on the pay lines.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With a classic casino theme with a Macau-inspired twist in place, 20 fixed pay lines, and plenty of special features for higher odds of winning big, Mr. Macau is another excellent title from the Betsoft Gaming giant worth looking into.</p>
