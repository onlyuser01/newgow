    <h1>Four Winds Casino 10 Free Slot Play South Lake Tahoe Casino Casinos At Sea Nyny Hotel Casino Nooksac</h1>

<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>In regards to that matter, we would like to provide all the information. Lettest87 got 340 euros as a loyalty cashback bonus. We value our users and offer a 10% cashback bonus on any deposit losses that occur within a month in order to increase their enjoyment of using our website.</p>
<p>According to the bonus requirements, only 5x of the bonus amount is withdrawable from the wins. It means he could only withdraw 1700 EUR. Moreover, the player violated the rule which referred to the maximum bet (20 EUR). Some of his bets exceeded the limit, and that caused him to win a lot more money.</p>
<p>The just course of action would be to forfeit all of the winnings and credit the money back, allowing him to wager the bonus once more in accordance with the bonus rules. However, we always prioritize customer satisfaction. Thus, Mystake team decided to grant him 7,500 euros as a gesture of goodwill. You may find it strange, but our brand always tries to meet the expectations of the players. Some users receive special gifts from the Loyalty team from time to time. Since he won more than 250K, which rarely happens, they made that exception for him.</p>
<p>Considering the facts, we donâ€™t understand the reason for the complaint. We allowed him to withdraw even more than the amount of cash back bonus permitted.</p>
<p>I hope these details will be helpful in resolving the case.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
