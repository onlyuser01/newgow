<p>Detroit Lions vs Pittsburgh Steelers is the final game of the 2022 NFL preseason. It’s played at Acrisure Stadium (formerly known as Heinz Field) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Sunday, August 28, with the kick-off time being 4:30 pm.</p>
<p>Although this is a preseason game, it doesn’t mean it’s not important. On the contrary, this game gives the head coaches one last chance to decide the roster for the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Even though we expect to see a lot of backups on the field, this isn’t going to be a snooze fest as all of them are determined to show their worth to their bosses.</p>

<p>Detroit Lions Looking Good in the Offense</p>
<p>The Lions are 1-1 in the preseason, with a loss at home to the Atlanta Falcons (27-23) and a win on the road against the Indianapolis Colts (27-26). Their defense didn’t do great in those two games – which was expected based on their performances in the 2021 season – but their offense was surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Coach Dan Campbell rotated his three quarterbacks in the first game of the preseason, with the likely starter in the 2022 NFL season Jared Goff getting the least time on the field. In the second game, Goff stayed sidelined all the time with backups David Blough and Tim Boyle sharing the QB role.</p>
<p>Both did relatively okay, each throwing for one touchdown against the Colts. We say “relatively” because they wouldn’t have done as great if it weren’t for their offensive teammates who had a fabulous game that day, most notably, wide receivers Tom Kennedy and Trinity Benson, as well as the guys from the offensive line.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers Want to end the Preseason With a 100% Win Record</p>
<p>Mike Tomlin’s boys did great in the two NFL preseason games they’ve played so far. They beat the Seattle Seahawks 32-25 at home, followed by a victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars 16-15 on the road. They’re back home for the final game of the preseason campaign and it’s needless to say that spirits are high in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>In their first preseason game, their offense was superb; in the second, it was their defense that did a fantastic job. What should we expect to happen in their third game of the preseason? A little bit of both is the answer.</p>
<p>We’re likely to see all three of their QBs get some time on the field – Kenny Pickett, Mitch Trubisky, and Mason Rudolph. For Rudolph, this could be a sort of a tryout game as the Lions are reportedly interested in a trade. For the other two, this game is the dress rehearsal for the regular season.</p>
<p>When it comes to their defense, they’re supposed to do okay on Sunday, with Tomlin probably giving a couple of new players a chance. Former Buffalo Bills cornerback Levi Wallace is likely to play and so should rookies DeMarvin Leal (defensive tackle) and Mark Robinson (linebacker).</p>
<p>Detroit Lions vs Pittsburgh Steelers Preseason Prediction</p>
<p>Lions vs Steelers is a preseason game, which is always hard to predict. Underdogs surprise the odds on a regular basis in these sorts of games, but this time, we don’t think it’s going to be like that. We think the favored Steelers are going to win.</p>
<p>They are a better team than the Lions and considering that this is the final game of the preseason, they might decide to go all-in. Another reason why that’s likely is that the game is played on their turf.</p>
<p>Picks: Pittsburgh Steelers to win and cover the spread; over 39 points</p>
