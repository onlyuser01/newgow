<p>Playtech ventures into Swiss gambling market with Swiss Casinos Group.</p>
<p>Playtech to offer games and supporting software to the casino operator.</p>
<p>Amended Swiss gambling law locks out unauthorized international gaming companies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, London-listed gaming technology provider Playtech officially launched its first live casino offering in Switzerland. This venture was made possible through a partnership deal that the technology provider has signed with the Swiss Casinos Group. The casino operator one of the leading gaming company’s in the country’s land-based casino sector. Swiss Casinos Group operates Casino Zurich, one of the country’s largest land-based casinos.</p>
<p>According to Shimon Akad, the chief operating officer of Playtech, Swiss Casinos was the right company to partners with for the Swiss gambling venture. This is mostly because of the gambling operator’s stellar reputation in the country. Besides, Playtech has always been very keen to expand its gaming footprint across several newly regulated markets and Switzerland was one of them.</p>
<p>“This kind of partnership, opening up a new sector in a newly regulated market, is a perfect example of our strategy in action. We look forward to a long, successful partnership with Swiss Casino,” the Playtech chief operating officer commented.</p>
<p>As per the terms of the very lucrative partnership deal, Playtech has been able to roll outs its amazing selection of casino and live casino products to online gamblers visiting Swiss Casinos Group facilities. This move was very timely – the technology provider managed to be the very first one to launch both jackpot casino games as well as a live casino client in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Playtech’s Technology</p>
<p>The Playtech offerings are part of the of its Playtech ONE omnichannel solution which gives players access to a wide variety of content from almost anywhere and on a wide range of devices. To make it even better, the players only need a single wallet and a single account to access all of that content.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the gaming technology provider’s casino games and live casino games are driven by Playtech IMS. This is an industry-leading player management system and data-driven business intelligence technology. With such a strong portfolio of in-house software, the casino has been able to not only provide industry-leading games but also a vast range of premium-branded games for their customers.</p>
<p>Gambling in Switzerland</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Switzerland amended its gambling law, a move that effectively gave Swiss land-based casinos the exclusive right to offer online gambling services. Initially, there was a long-standing loophole in the country’s law which allowed unauthorized international gambling operators to offer their services to the country’s residents. These loopholes were sealed by the amendments.</p>
<p>Now, the local physical casinos are allowed to partner with international gaming companies. On the flip side, the international operators are not allowed to bring standalone gambling operations into the country.</p>
