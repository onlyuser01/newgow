    <h1>Caf Casino Casino Tucson Tampa Florida Casino 123 Vegas Casino Slots Jackpot Casino Casinorex Player</h1>

<p>Dear casinoguru team,</p>
<p>I am from Germany, but due to easier communication I have decided to submit my complaint in English.</p>
<p>some days ago, at the 25th of November, I was able to register myself with my personal details on the online Casino site "Casinorex.com".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have had issues with a number of casinos operating under N1 Interactive limited (licence holder/ MGA / BC2 / 394/2017 issued on 08/01/2018) which owns and operates a variety of casino brands, one of which is Casinorex.</p>
<p>For example I requested to be completely self excluded in august 2021 on „live.casino", which is a casino operating under the N1 Interactive MGA licence which also operates casinorex. They did not asked me why or something.</p>
<p>I also emailed them to request to be blocked from all of their other casinos or brands, if not already happened.</p>
<p>But I still was able to open a new account at casinorex and to make deposits over 1850,00€ in total.</p>
<p>I also want to mention, that before I self excluded myself at „live.casino", I also did that on for example „slotwolf", which is also operating under the same license. At this point it was not possible to exclude „forever" at slotwolf, there was just the option to exclude myself for a specific time.</p>
<p>Another, but not decivise point is, that I asked the casinorex support before I startet to play, ehrtet gambling is still allowed in Germany, otherwise they should please close my account directly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the support gave me wrong information here as well, as gambling in Germany has generally only be permitted under German licenses and according to German player protection since this year.</p>
<p>However, I feel the operators and license holders responsible gaming system has more than failed to me and at this point, my addiction took over and I lost control.</p>
<p>For sure I used the same credentials on all of their Sites.</p>
<p>Please see attached picture from live.casino, as a proof for my self exclusion.</p>
<p>Attached you will also find the mail to livecasino, as well as a Short chat log.</p>
<p>I clearly request casinorex to reimburse me my deposits.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and kind regards.</p>
