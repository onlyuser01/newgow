    <h1>Casinos In Florida Muckleshoot Casino Auburn Wa The Rivers Casino James Bond Casino Royale Arizona C</h1>

<p>I originally signed up with Robinroo Casino on 1st May 2021. At the time of sign up before i could even make a deposit i was asked to provide all documents to fully verify my account including Licence, Credit Card, Electricity Account for proof of address etc So before i start i just to clarify that my account has been fully verified from day 1.</p>
<p>On 24th Nov 2021 i made a deposit no wagering requirements as no bonus used. I then won $40k on keno. I put in 2 withdrawal requests at $5k per request totalling $10k as per the withdrawal limit of $5k pwk.</p>
<p>On 30th Nov 2021 $5k hit my bank account. week had passed &amp; i got on live chat to query why it was still showing as pending. I was informed it had been finalised on their end &amp; must be my bank holding it up. A few hours later i got an email congratulating me on my win &amp; to confirm the max withdrawal limit of $5k per week. 8th December second $5k hit my bank account. Up until this point i had only ever been contacted by Robinroo support. On 13th Dec 12:17pm i got an odd email from a Mike - VIP Manager he was writing to inform me on my account status. He said they'd become aware my account 'Melzii3' is in direct violation of Terms and Conditions. that i'd created a secondary account on 8th May 2021. there was a hyperlink to section 4 of their T&amp;C stating are only one account per household, computer &amp; workplace &amp; that winnings will only be paid out to players having one account. He said if you have more than one account, all winnings and bonuses will be VOID &amp; In accordance to their T&amp;C that my Melzii3 account will be revoked, and subsequently, all balances will be voided! How is it that this has only just conveniently come to their attention now that im owed $34k &amp; not anytime prior in the past 7 months my account has been active for when i've had a fully verified &amp; account that i used regularly. I had no need for a secondary account.</p>
<p>I tried to sign in only to find my account could not be accessed, said to contact support in which i did. They repeated what the email had said, and suggested i wait for respond via email. Clearly outraged i emailed back, to say i had no second account &amp; reiterated that i already had a fully verified account &amp; that they had no right to wrongly accuse me, close my account &amp; void my winnings &amp; that i would be proceeding with legal action. I got a reply that advising that on 8th May 2021 a secondary account had been created matching the following details: name, phone, address, DOB &amp; IP address. Now from my understanding, if i was to sign up to any casino with the matching details of an existing user, it would tell me that a user with that same email or mobile or username already exists right?? Making it impossible for me to have duplicated my own account with the same matching details.</p>
<p>Instantly i knew they had to be making this up in order to not have to pay me the outstanding balance of $34,000 that and the fact that on the date they have given being 8th May 2021 i was away for work for the week &amp; in fact on the road driving that exact day to reach our destination making it impossible for me to have a) duplicated a secondary account little own from the same IP address as my account which i opened and use at home. Not only that i had proof to indicate my whereabouts on the date given. I emailed them asking for proof of this so called account. I asked them to supply me with the transaction history to this account. Surely if i was using a second account wouldn't my credit cards be linked to it?? I wanted to see something, anything whatever they had that linked me to this so called account other than my name, address, DOB &amp; mobile number which is all easily accessible information that anyone would be able to get hold of.</p>
<p>NO RESPOSE/PROOF HAS BEEN GIVEN TO DATE</p>
<p>NO ATTEMPT TO PHONE ME TO DISCUSS ANYTHING</p>
<p>TO DATE MY ACCOUNT REMAINS CLOSED</p>
<p>Every time i attempt to get an answer, i receive an email back advising a ticket is created. The following day i receive an email saying the ticket has been solved. To date i have tried to get them to give me the time of day to plead my case. I have forwarded 2 emails from 2 separate companies both providing invoices to clarify my location on 8th May 2021. First email is from my employer which had my payslip attached which clearly shows me being reimbursed by the company for the accom i had pre-paid for whilst away for work 8th - 14th May 2021. Second email is from AirBnB with the invoice attached showing check-in check-out credit card details. same card that's verified on my Robinroo account! NO further correspondence has been received.</p>
<p>I have lodged a civil dispute https://www.centraldisputesystem.com on 17th Dec but no response has been given.</p>
<p>I have been wrongly accused, account closed, balance VOIDED &amp; all correspondence attempts ignored in a plea in order to not have to proceed with paying out my complete balance owing of $34,000 after already paying me $10,000. PLEASE HELP ME</p>
