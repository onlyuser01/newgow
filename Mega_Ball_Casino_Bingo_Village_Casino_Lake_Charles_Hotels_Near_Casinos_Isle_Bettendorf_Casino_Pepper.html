    <h1>Mega Ball Casino Bingo Village Casino Lake Charles Hotels Near Casinos Isle Bettendorf Casino Pepper</h1>

<p>Actor Jerry Ferrara will become the newest celebrity partner of leading US gambling operator BetMGM. Ferrara will feature in a marketing campaign for the brand, participate in various promotional events, and co-host its long-running sports podcast “Unleashed.”</p>
<p>Ferrara Is an Emerging Movie and TV Celebrity</p>
<p>Ferrara is best known for his role as Turtle on HBO’s comedy series Entourage. His other recent TV roles include Joe Proctor in the Starz crime drama series Power and Kirk Zehnder in USA Network’s Shooter TV series. Ferrara has also earned three Screen Actors Guild nominations and starred in several feature-length films like Sully, Dating and New York, and Club Life.</p>
<p>The breakout star is a passionate New York Yankees, New York Knicks, and New York Giants fan. He also hosts the Bad 4 Business (B4B) podcast, which focuses on interviews with actors, athletes, and ordinary people.</p>
<p>He Will Co-host BetMGM’s Sports Podcast</p>
<p>As BetMGM’s official celebrity partner, Ferrara will be the co-host of the brand’s sports-related podcast “Unleashed,” which is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Audible. He will also be part of an upcoming marketing campaign for the operator and feature in fan events.</p>
<p>Ferrara expressed his excitement to work with BetMGM and share his passion as a diehard sports fan via the upcoming podcasts.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be the first BetMGM ambassador to co-host Unleashed, and I’m excited to share my passion and knowledge with fellow sports fans. Jerry Ferrara</p>
<p>Matt Prevost, BetMGM’s Chief Revenue Officer, lauded Ferrara’s talents as an actor and exclaimed that the Entourage star would help create unique and fun content for the podcast and engage with sports fans through the operator’s other promotional events.</p>
<p>Celebrity Campaigns Are Nothing New for Gambling Operators</p>
<p>BetMGM is not the only gambling operator to recently attract celebrity endorsement. In May, SciPlay started a new marketing campaign for its game Jackpot Party, featuring actress and entrepreneur Sofia Vergara. The company hoped to leverage Vergara’s substantial fan base to draw attention to its Jackpot Party app.</p>
<p>In June, crypto-based online sports betting platform Sportsbet.io attracted football legend Kanu Nwankwo as its newest African ambassador. The four-year contract will see Kanu partake in various promotional efforts to tap the ever-growing popularity of cryptocurrency on the continent. With his endorsement, the operator hopes to tap into Africa’s rapidly growing sports betting market.</p>
<p>In a twist, one celebrity recently started a gaming venture of his own. Social media star Jake Paul recently co-founded a sports betting app called Betr, focusing on micro-betting. The business venture attracted significant interest from investors, sports team owners, influencers, athletes, and celebrities, gathering a substantial $50 million. Paul will use his social media influence to promote the new app. His weekly sports show “BS w/ Jake Paul” will become part of Betr’s media venture and will play an active role in the promotional campaign.</p>
