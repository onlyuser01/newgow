    <h1>Hotels Close To Winstar Casino Bet Casino Casino Tucson Draftkings Casino Michigan Northern Edge Cas</h1>

<p>Well they paid me but it took much longer then the 48 hours they claimed also they owed me $25 and only sent me $20. On their website they claim to pay for all fees when you withdraw money but they kept telling me I had to withdraw in dogecoin if I wanted my money because the BtC transfer fees were to high. Well I finally caved in and made a dogecoin wallet but they ended up paying me in BtC anyways and took $5 off my balance for the transfer fee... I still feel like they owe me $5! The website lied about both the 48 hour transfer time (it took about a week 7 days) and they made me pay the transfer fee after making me wait all that time ðŸ˜¡. I have numerous screenshots of customer reps telling me that I would be paid in 3-4 hours and the next day 4-5 hours and all of it was lies. Somebody told me that when the price of BTC is going up this casino will wait as long as they want before they pay you so that they send less BTC then what you should have got. So they made me wait all that time and sent me less BTC and on top of that made me pay $5 for the transfer!! I was cheated out of more then the $5 if you look it at it mathematically!</p>
