    <h1>18 Casino Near Me Closest Casino To Nashville Tn Las Vegas Casino Slots List Of Casino Games Caribbe</h1>

<p>I exactly know what you're talking about since this sadly happens quite often and our Complaints team deals with such cases on a regular basis. I'd say it depends on the information you get from the customer support.</p>
<p>For example: You come to a casino, you register, choose US as your country of residence, then you go to the chat. You ask the support if it's OK to play in their casino from US. If they confirm it's OK, you make a few deposits, lose, then you make another one, win and they refuse to payout the winnings since you apparently play from a restricted country, I believe it's their fault since the support gave you wrong info. In such cases, you should get your winnings and then they can close your account.</p>
<p>In such cases, casinos sometimes say that their Terms say your country is restricted no matter what the support said, but I don't think it's right. The support should be there for you and they must provide you with the correct information.</p>
<p>Whenever you ask the support for information that could potentially have some impact on you in the future, I always recommend to take screenshots.</p>
