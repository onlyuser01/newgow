Annually, CT Interactive seeks to introduce up to two dozen new games, delivering content that appeals to a wide range of audiences.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria, the company confirmed that a new portion of its engaging games were certified for the market in the European country. Last week, CT Interactive confirmed that a captivating collection of its slot games was certified for the market. Those games promise to deliver unique entertainment and engaging experiences for online players. Moreover, the certified content enables CT Interactive to reach new players.</p>
<p>The latest certification will enable Bulgarian players to access a special suite of fruit-themed slot games from the leading iGaming supplier.

Just like other games from CT Interactive, the recently certified games feature fruit symbols that are instantly recognizable and stand out with their quality design.</p>
<p>The list of titles that were recently certified in Bulgaria includes games such as Giraffe Wild and The Big Chilli. Additionally, new players are going to be able to access CT Interactive's game which offers a unique 5x5 layout called Wizard Blizzard 5x5.
