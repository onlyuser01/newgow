<p>‘Thursday Night Football’: Green Bay Packers Looking to Show Win Over Dallas Wasn’t a Fluke</p>

<p>This past Sunday, the slumping Green Bay Packers did the unthinkable when they handed the Dallas Cowboys a loss in OT. Now, they’re hoping to show it wasn’t an accident in their “Thursday Night Football” matchup against the 6-3 Tennessee Titans.</p>

<p>After five consecutive losses, the Packers finally tasted success at the end of Week 10. It could prove to have been a pivotal moment for QB Aaron Rodgers and the Pack, as they can now improve their chances of seeing a deep postseason run.</p>
<p>The victory wasn’t just a big moment for the Packers, but for first-year wide receiver Christian Watson as well. He entered the game with just 88 receiving yards and zero touchdowns, and came out of it with 107 yards on four receptions and three TDs. The Titans will be keeping a close eye on him on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Getting Loud at Lambeau</p>
<p>Thursday night’s game plays out in Green Bay’s backyard. Lambeau Field, now the second-oldest NFL stadium in the US, will be rocking with Packers fans who are just as reenergized as Rodgers.</p>

<p>Green Bay is now in second place in the NFC North, even though they’re a team that’s had many offensive problems this season. The Pack hopes the recent upset and the home crowd, weathering sub-freezing temperatures, will make a difference in their performance as Week 11 gets underway.</p>
<p>The Titans beat the Denver Broncos 17-10 on Sunday and descend on Green Bay as the leaders of the AFC South. Running back Derrick Henry has become the team’s best offensive weapon, even if he was a little slower than normal in that game.</p>
<p>Henry had 19 carries for 53 yards against the Broncos, the first time in five games he failed to hit triple digits. The Titans have won six of their last seven, and the seven-year vet has been a big part of that success. The Titans currently have one of the best rushing offenses in the NFL, averaging 133.4 yards per game, and will continue to push the ground game.</p>
<p>Packers Out in Front</p>
<p>The last time these two teams met, almost two years ago, Green Bay won by a score of 40-14. Every time the Titans turned around, the Packers were there to frustrate their attempts.</p>
<p>The recent history between these two leans toward the Titans, however. They’ve played Green Bay six times since 2001, with Tennessee taking four of those games. In spite of that, Tennessee hasn’t won at Lambeau since 2004.</p>
<p>Almost 10 years ago, Rodgers put up one of his best-ever performances against the Titans, throwing three TDs and running for another two. At the end of the day, the Packers walked away with a stunning 55-7 win.</p>
<p>This game won’t be that lopsided, but the Packers are going in as favorites. Much of that can be chalked up to the Lambeau bleachers.</p>
<p>This is going to be one of the toughest games of Week 11, especially if others get rescheduled this Sunday because of the weather. The Packers don’t have the best defense against a rushing game, but they know what they’re up against and what’s at stake on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks have shifted the lines downward slightly each week as the season has progressed, and the over/under for this game is around 41. Hitting that mark shouldn’t be a problem for two teams with veteran squads and a strong will to thrash their opponents.</p>
