    <h1>Clams Casino Recipes Sls Sahara Casino Free Online Casino Slot Games Lousiana Casinos Doubledown Cas</h1>

<p>I registered with Cadoola in mid-April and deposited €100 by credit card (no bonus used). I then came up with a winning sum of € 500, which I also wanted to have paid out. After a few days of waiting, I contacted the live chat to ask when the payment would be made. They asked me to be patient due to "technical issues". About a week later my bank contacted me that my credit card details were circulating on the internet and I immediately blocked my credit card. Two days later, my withdrawal request was canceled because the bank had returned the transfer (because the card was blocked). So Cadoola's email support (28.04.) wrote me that they need my bank account details to transfer the money to me. I immediately replied to the email with the required data. In the meantime I made another deposit (€100) - this time using my new credit card details - played - won another €500 - made a withdrawal request - and actually got the money credited to my current credit card account about a week later.</p>
<p>But nothing happened to the outstanding €500 on my account. This was followed by countless chats with the support of the site - I also had to send the required data to another e-mail address (kyc@cadoola.com) - until today (2 months) I have not received any e-mail support got only answer. The €500 is also visible as a credit in my account, but I can't create a withdrawal request because a pop-up appears with the text "Account frozen". The chat support was also unable to answer me when my payout would be processed.</p>
