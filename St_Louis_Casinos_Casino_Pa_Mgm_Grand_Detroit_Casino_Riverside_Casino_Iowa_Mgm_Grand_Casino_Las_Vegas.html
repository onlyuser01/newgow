    <h1>St Louis Casinos Casino Pa Mgm Grand Detroit Casino Riverside Casino Iowa Mgm Grand Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Rabona team would like to provide details regarding the current case, which we would clarify the situation for all parties involved.</p>
<p>After a check performed by our Risk team, it was found out that the player is creating duplicates on the brand with the aim to take advantage of our bonus system.</p>
<p>Due to this, we have acted in full accordance with the following T&amp;C on our site:</p>
<p>3.2 Your account with the Website must be registered in your own, correct, name. Only one account per person, per household/address, per phone number/email, and per IP address is allowed. Any other accounts that are opened on the Website will be considered as "Duplicate Accounts". You must not attempt to open a Duplicate Account, including by providing false or alternative credentials. If you open or attempt to open any number of Duplicate Accounts, we reserve the right to close some or all of your accounts without any compensation and apply the following sanctions:</p>
<p>3.2.1 each action performed using a Duplicate Account is considered void;</p>
<p>3.2.2 any promotions that the Duplicate Account has participated in will be canceled;</p>
<p>3.2.3 any winnings obtained on the Duplicate Account will be void. Any processed withdrawals will be reversed and will be owed back to the Company;</p>
<p>3.2.4 the Duplicate Account will be closed without an option to reopen it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do consider such actions consisting of duplicate creation as fraudulent against us, due to the fact that this is being made with the clear idea to take advantage of our bonus system and get a bigger chance of making winnings.</p>
<p>Our Risk team has also detected the use of the same payment method on different accounts and this is one more evidence of the fraudulent activity against us.</p>
<p>All of the previous clarification has led us to further refer to the following T&amp;C:</p>
<p>9.4 Should we arrive at a reasonable suspicion that you have engaged in fraud, any illegal or improper activity, or have otherwise breached the Terms, we reserve the right to take any number of the following action, at our sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice:</p>
<p>9.4.1 immediately block your account and suspend your access to the Website and/or its services, suspend all pending withdrawal requests and other payments to you for the period of investigation;</p>
<p>9.4.2 permanently close your account with the Website and all other partner websites on our platform and deny any future use of the Website and the partner websites;</p>
<p>9.4.3 void any winnings obtained, cancel any pending withdrawals and refund the last deposit made into the account;</p>
<p>9.4.4 void any winnings obtained, cancel any pending withdrawals and confiscate the real money balance of your account;</p>
<p>9.4.5 void any bonus balance on your account and/or limit your future participation in our bonus and promotional offers or deny them to you;</p>
<p>We would like to clarify that the player has in reality not lost any money, due to the fact that the withdrawal made prior to the account closure is more than the deposited amount.</p>
<p>We have acted in full accordance with our General T&amp;C and have applied the needed measures to prevent further harm caused to us.</p>
<p>The account will remain closed due to all of the above points.</p>
<p>We hope this text fully clarifies the current case.</p>
<p>In case of further questions, we remain available.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Rabona Customer Support Team</p>
