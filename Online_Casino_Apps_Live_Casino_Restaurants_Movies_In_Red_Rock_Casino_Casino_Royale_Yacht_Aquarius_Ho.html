<p>The prohibition of college sports wagering partnerships is one of the changes aimed at college-aged audiences</p>
<p>The US gaming industry body, the American Gaming Association (AGA), published an update to its Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering, bringing further protection for young audiences and adding age restrictions for those featuring in sports betting advertising.</p>
<p>Introducing Legal Age of Wagering</p>
<p>The update to the code setting the industry standard for responsibility in marketing and advertising of sports betting was developed in collaboration with AGA members and is set to bring the most significant changes to the policy since its inception.</p>
<p>Commenting on the policy changes, AGA president and chief executive officer, Bill Miller, outlined that the code established in 2019 “reflects the commitment of [AGA] members to set and adhere to a high bar for responsible advertising.”</p>
<p>“Today’s updates advance that commitment and represent our intention to protect consumers and evolve our standards as this nascent market matures,” Miller added.</p>
<p>Seeking to enhance the level of protection for college-aged audiences, the new code updates introduce several changes, including the prohibition of college partnerships promoting, marketing or advertising sports wagering, with the exclusion of alumni networks or content aimed at raising problem gambling awareness or focused on responsible gaming, and of sportsbook NIL deals for amateur and college athletes.</p>
<p>For the first time, AGA’s code sets age restrictions for those participating in sports wagering advertising and promotional campaigns, prohibiting individuals aged under the age of 21 to participate in sports betting advertising, and changing all references to “the legal age of wagering” to 21 and above.</p>
<p>“Advertising plays an essential role in migrating consumers away from predatory illegal sportsbooks and into the protections of the legal, regulated market while providing responsible gaming resources,” continued Miller, outlining the commitment of the association and its members “to building a sustainable marketplace that protects vulnerable populations and gives consumers the knowledge and tools to keep sports betting fun for adults.”</p>
<p>No More “Risk Free” in Gaming Messages</p>
<p>The changes also include a ban on the use of “risk free” in advertising and a formal annual review process and update for the responsible advertising standards. The new updates are set to go into effect immediately, allowing for a grace period until July 1, 2023, for existing or deployed assets.</p>
<p>Alongside the code updates, the industry body appointed the founder and principal consultant at Logan Avenue Consulting LLC and consulting partner for the Responsible Gaming Council, Dr. Jennifer Shatley, as co-chair of the Code Compliance Board.</p>
<p>With more than 25 years of responsible gaming policy experience, Dr. Shatley will provide oversight of the compliance board and review complaints about code violations.</p>
