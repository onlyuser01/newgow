<p>Who wouldâ€™ve thought that the Cincinnati Bengals would be so good in 2021? They finished the previous season with a 4-11 record. After seven weeks in the 2021 season, theyâ€™re 5-2. Can they add another victory to the count?</p>
<p>It seems that doing it is not going to be a problem in Week 8. Not only are they on a superb run, but theyâ€™re also facing one of the worst teams in the AFC. The team in question is the New York Jets, whose record is 1-5.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers see the Bengals as a clear favorite to win the Week 8 game, as you can see from the odds theyâ€™re giving. The question is, can the Bengals cover the 10-point spread?</p>

<p>Bengals Keep Getting Better and Better</p>
<p>The Bengals werenâ€™t too impressive in the pre-season, winning one of their three games. Then, in Week 1, we saw them beating the Minnesota Vikings in overtime 27-24. Next came a loss against the Chicago Bears by just three points.</p>
<p>Then, they won two straight games â€“ against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. They lost to the Green Bay Packers in Week 5, even though they took the game to overtime.</p>
<p>In Week 6, we saw them destroying the Detroit Lions 34-11, which was expected. What wasnâ€™t expected was the Bengals blowout win over the Ravens in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The Bengals won 41-17, with quarterback Joe Burrow recording 416 passing yards, his career-high. Speaking of records, receiver Jaâ€™Marr Chase went on to cover career-high 201 yards.</p>
<p>Equally impressive was the Bengalsâ€™ defense, which held Lamar Jackson to just one passing touchdown. If they managed to stop the in-form Ravensâ€™ QB, they should have no problems doing the same against the Jetsâ€™ QB.</p>
<p>Jetsâ€™ Starting QB Zach Wilson Out With an Injury</p>
<p>Zach Wilson suffered a PCL injury in the Week 7 game against the New England Patriots and will have to stay off the field for at least a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The big question is, who will his replacement be in Week 8? Mike White was given that role against the Pats and did relatively okay. Right after coming in, the guy threw his first-ever touchdown in the regular season.</p>
<p>No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson suffered an injury and walked to the locker room.</p>
<p>The Jets scored this touchdown on the very next play with Mike White at QB.</p>

<p>White started very well, but then had problems doing a lot in the remainder of the game. He finished with 20/32 passing, which isnâ€™t that bad. Whatâ€™s bad is that he threw two interceptions and got sacked once.</p>
<p>In addition to White, the Jets also have Josh Johnson as a QB option. The veteran has been a real journeyman throughout his career, even spending some time at Cincinnati as Andy Daltonâ€™s backup. The trouble with Johnson is that he hasnâ€™t played a game since 2018.</p>
<p>All this means the Jets are in trouble. Winning the Week 8 game seems like mission impossible for this team. In fact, the only thing they should hope for is not to get obliterated by the Bengals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, it seems that a blowout loss is on the way. The Bengals look certain to win the game by at least 10 points.</p>
<p>Pick: Cincinnati Bengals to win and cover the 10-point spread; over should hit as a result.</p>
