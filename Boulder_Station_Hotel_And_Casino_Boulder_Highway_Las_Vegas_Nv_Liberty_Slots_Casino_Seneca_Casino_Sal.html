<p>Several gaming machines and firearms were seized from the site on Wednesday, police said. The business allegedly fronted as a furniture store.</p>
<p>When police first entered the operation, suspects at the scene broke windows to escape from the store and ran across the street to scatter, KCAL, a local TV station, reported based on a video they viewed.</p>
<p>The raid came after police surveilled the furniture store for two months, according to the Orange County Register newspaper.</p>
<p>Authorities recently obtained a search warrant. SWAT officers and other personnel then descended on the enterprise.</p>
<p>Police told the newspaper they had gotten over 50 recent complaints about the business they searched on Wednesday. It was described by authorities as a “24-hour a day operation every day.”</p>
<p>Slaphouse Explained</p>
<p>“Slaphouse” is the term used to describe an illegal gambling operation found in a residence or business, KABC, another local TV station, explained in a recent report.</p>
<p>The name relates to players “slapping” the controls on some of the games.</p>
<p>Slaphouses are often hidden in abandoned businesses or operate using a storefront of a seemingly legitimate enterprise.</p>
<p>Often, they are sources of related criminal activity, police have reported.</p>
<p>Neighboring Alleged Slaphouse Raided in October</p>
<p>During an October raid, Anaheim police apprehended about 70 people at an alleged slaphouse located next-door to the one raided on Wednesday. Some 25 of them were later issued citations in 2020, such as for alleged drug violations or gambling charges.</p>
<p>Thirteen were booked at the Anaheim Detention Facility for more serious offenses, including warrants, parole/probation violations, and gambling violations, Anaheim Police Sgt. Shane Carringer told Casino.org back in October. Their cases were forwarded to local courts.</p>
<p>That storefront was vacant, but formerly was a hydroponics business, police added. Police seized over two dozen video gaming machines and electronic gambling tables in October. Currency was also seized from that alleged gambling joint.</p>
<p>Carringer noted that three handguns were found at the suspected gambling site, as well as a “variety of drugs and drug paraphernalia.”</p>
<p>Officers used flashbangs to initially startle the crowd. The business was described in October by KCAL as a “shuttered storefront for an out-of-business hydroponics shop.”</p>
<p>In January 2020, the Long Beach Post, another California newspaper, reported that several illegal gambling operations appeared in the Long Beach region over 12 months. They were found in a vacant dollar store in Zaferia and an old thrift shop in North Long Beach, the report added.</p>
<p>Between July 2019 and January 2020, local police closed eight different alleged illegal gaming sites, the Post said. Visitors were apprehended.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in Texas last month, two police raids in Hood County led authorities to seize 88 illegal eight-liner gaming machines, according to KXAS, a Fort Worth TV station.</p>
