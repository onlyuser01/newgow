<p>Little Bighorn review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Little Bighorn is themed around the famous Battle of the Little Bighorn where Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes fought the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army and won.</p>
<p>Players will ride out onto a gloomy plain, the sky bronzed by the sunset. Here, they’ll encounter a variety of characters, including Native Americans and US cavalry. With an array of weapons at hand, they’ll join the fray and fight to the end of the battle.</p>
<p>This slot may especially interest history buffs and those who enjoy Old Western slot themes.</p>
<p>Win in the base game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The mournful soundtrack is filled with twanging notes that highlight the Old Western atmosphere of this slot. The reels spin with a mechanical click that brings to mind a gun cocking, which increases the sense of tension.</p>
<p>The color palette of Little Bighorn’s graphics is restrained, focusing on the dusky shades of brown, orange, and grey. This creates a somber mood that fits the battle scene well.</p>
<p>Some American history enthusiasts may recognize the characters that appear on the reels, such as Sitting Bull and George Armstrong Custer. The animation of these historical figures has a faded, antique look that creates the impression of old photographs.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of weapons among the symbols, including ornately decorated axes, pistols, and knives. Native American cultural symbols, such as totem poles, also appear.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and graphics create a moody fantasy of the iconic Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Little Bighorn has a 3-4-5-3-2 reel structure.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel and going towards the rightmost.</p>
<p>The maximum win while playing Little Bighorn is 25,676x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Scalp Wilds appear only on the third reel and when they land, any American soldier symbols on the reels will transform into Wild symbols. Then the Scalp Wild symbol will always nudge to cover the entire reel, with each nudge adding a +1 multiplier to the new Wild symbols.</p>
<p>Totem Scatters appear on the second, third, and forth reels during the base game as well as during the Scalp Free Spins feature. Totem Scatters appear only on the third, forth, and fifth reels during the Spirit Call Free Spins.</p>
<p>If players land 1-2 Totem Scatters while in the base game, they are transformed into expanding Wilds. Whenever Totem Scatters appear during the Free Spins feature, they are transformed into expanding Wilds and award an additional free spin.</p>
<p>Big win in the free spins feature</p>
<p>If players land 3 Totem Scatters, the Scalp Free Spins feature begins, starting with 8 free spins. If players land a No Mercy Scatter symbol, the Spirit Call Free Spins feature is triggered and +2 spins are awarded.</p>
<p>No Mercy Scatters only appear on the fifth reel and when they land fully on that reel, the Spirit Call Respin feature begins. The No Mercy Scatter travels to the first reel as the feature begins and one of the Wild chieftain symbols is revealed, each offering unique special features.</p>
<p>Players can up their bet by 50% to guarantee a Totem Scatter will appear on the second reel.</p>
