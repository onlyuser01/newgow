<p>Land-based gambling in Brazil</p>
<p>Brazil's gambling culture has a rocky history. Authorized gambling was legal up until 1941 when the Social Democratic Party moved to 'preserve social morality' and outlawed most kinds of betting activity. The main reason behind this was gambling's links to organized crime, and the government wanted to introduce tough measures to combat it. Only two exceptions escaped the ban – lotteries and horse racing.</p>
<p>Much of this strict legislation is still in place today, although there have been several attempts to overturn it. Some activities, such as poker and sports betting, have seen the rules around them relaxed — Law No. 13,756/2018 introduced in 2019 effectively legalized sports betting — and it's possible for entities to apply for a license to offer them to clients.</p>
<p>Note: To understand which games are allowed in Brazil, it's useful to look at them through the prism of 'games of chance'. The more a game is seen to be down to chance, or luck, the less chance it has of it being permitted – this explains why poker, with all the skill involved, is generally accepted, while slots machines and roulette have had a tough time.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen a concerted effort from certain sectors to relax the restrictions on gambling further. Several important bills have been put before Brazilian Congress proposing the regulation of casinos and casino games, however these are subject to a long approval process and, as of December 2020, still haven't been passed.</p>
<p>Because of the strict legislation, there are only a handful of casinos in Brazil today and these only offer authorized betting games. There's a chance that more will appear in the future with possible reform on the horizon, but, until then, Brazil remains one of the most restrictive countries on the South American continent when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>Internet gambling in Brazil</p>
<p>Brazilian law does not formally recognize online gambling as an activity, so the practice is generally treated similar to its land-based equivalent from a legal perspective.</p>
<p>Yet despite moves towards relaxing laws in the land-based industry, the government has maintained a consistent stance against online activity. In 2008 and 2010, legislative acts banning players from internet betting were brought before Congress but were ultimately voted down.</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean? Well, strict opposition means no domestic betting website has ever been created, however, there is no law against players in Brazil using foreign betting sites or online casinos. Many Portugal-based sites have taken advantage of their shared language by offering their services to a much bigger audience than in their own country.</p>
<p>That said, anti-virtual gambling movements still exist in Brazil and, if they are successful, then the law will change. For this reason, it's sensible to do your own research before gambling if you're in the country.</p>
<p>How to choose the best Brazil online casino</p>
<p>Casino Guru aims to help you find the perfect playing experience when you visit an online casino. This page contains a series of filters that will help you sort through the Brazil-friendly casinos out there to find the ones matching your preferences.</p>
<p>Starting with the 'Recommended' filter: when you select this tab, you'll see the most highly-rated Brazil casinos, according to our team of experts – these passed our test with flying colours. The 'Newly opened' tab, meanwhile, will give you the most recently added sites available to players in Brazil, and 'All' will present the full list of available options.</p>
<p>You can employ other filters to pinpoint your preferred site. Mobile casinos are a popular choice for players and clicking 'mobile-friendly casinos' will find the casinos you can play while on the move. You can also find sites that accept the Brazilian Real by going to the 'Currency' filter and choosing 'BRL' in that section.</p>
<p>Note: If you're looking for further information on searching for great casino sites, then check out our How to choose an online casino article that will inform you of every aspect of the process and will help you avoid choosing the wrong casino.</p>
<p>Brazil online casino bonuses</p>
<p>Online casino bonuses tend to be popular among players simply because they give us the chance to suss out what a new casino is like and the quality of games it offers. The two main types of bonuses are deposit bonuses, when a casino gives you free credit or spins after you deposit money, or no deposit bonuses, when you get them before you part with a single cent.</p>
<p>You can see which bonuses are available to casino players by going to our list of casino bonuses and choosing 'Brazil' in the 'Bonuses for players from' section. To whittle these down according to type, simply go to the 'Bonus Type' section and choose the relevant sort, so for deposit bonuses just choose the 'Deposit Bonus' option. Visiting the list of deposit bonuses and selecting 'Brazil' there will also give you these options.</p>
<p>The Casino Guru team works hard to keep the selection as fresh as possible, so each one you click on will be relevant and up to date.</p>
