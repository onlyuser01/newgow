<p>Information about EcoCard casinos</p>
<p>EcoCard was a prepaid card operated by payment provider ecoPayz. It has since been rebranded as the ecoPayz Mastercard, but customers could still use their old cards until the end of 2020, if necessary.</p>
<p>There are still ecoCard casinos around, despite it being defunct: you just use the ecoPayz Mastercard now instead. You can find out how to find the best ecoPayz sites by going to our ecoPayz casinos page, where you can also find info about the company behind the payment method, the pros and cons of the service, how to make ecoPayz deposits, and how to find bonuses offered by ecoPayz casinos.</p>
<p>History of ecoCard</p>
<p>ecoCard was launched in the year 2000 by UK company PSI-Pay Ltd. Its intention was to explore the new digital market, and its name appealed to the growing interest in green business practices at the time.</p>
<p>In 2008, ecoCard was authorized by the FSA (Financial Services Authority) as an electronic money issuer â€“ a move that boosted their reputation in the UK payments industry. Its range of services expanded, too. Instead of just a prepaid card, the company began to offer a digital wallet and an app. This led to a rebranding in 2013: ecoPayz became the umbrella name for all company services, with the ecoCard being just one of them.</p>
<p>Note: The company has since enjoyed global success. It has created a presence in many countries, and forged a key partnership with Western Union, making them the only UK-based e-wallet to have such a deal. Another important link-up with Mastercard led to the ecoCard becoming the ecoPayz Mastercard: all prepaid cards now featured the famous Mastercard logo. Users with the old ecoCards had until the end of 2020 to use them before switching over to the new card.</p>
<p>Today, ecoPayz Mastercard holders have more benefits than ecoCard holders did: they can use it in millions of ATMs worldwide, and control their spending easily via a nicely designed app. Its prepaid nature makes it particularly useful for online casino players who can only spend the money they load onto it and keep track of how much they're gambling.</p>
<p>Finding the best ecoCard casino for you</p>
<p>It's still possible to find casinos offering ecoCard as a payment method: just remember that you'll need to use ecoPayz Mastercard instead. To fully enjoy your experience, though, it's essential to find a safe casino to play on.</p>
<p>Casino Guru is dedicated to helping you find the best casinos, and this page will help you find the most reliable ecoCard sites. Our team have analyzed each online casino and awarded them a Safety Index: this reflects their performance in terms of objective criteria. You can see each casino's rating in the information box next to them.</p>
<p>Our filters will help you quickly find the sites you want. Here a few of the most important ones.</p>
<p>Recommended</p>
<p>The quickest way to find the best ecoCard sites is clicking the 'Recommended' tab. These are the options that score the highest according to our team and will give you the best chance of a positive playing experience.</p>
<p>Newly opened</p>
<p>Sometimes, new casinos interest us. They might have some tempting welcome bonuses as they try to build a good reputation. Select this tab to see those.</p>
<p>Game provider</p>
<p>If you're a fan of a certain games company, then this filter is the one to use. 1x2 Gaming and Betsoft are two examples of popular companies.</p>
<p>Currencies</p>
<p>Different casinos accept different currencies. A growing number of crypto casinos accept Bitcoin and other virtual currencies for deposits, for example. This filter will help you find the currencies you want to use.</p>
<p>EcoCard casino bonuses</p>
<p>One last thing you might want to do is find bonuses offered by EcoCard casinos. These could include a deposit bonus, which you receive after making a payment, or a no deposit bonus that you get just for registering with the casino.</p>
<p>Our list of casino bonuses is the place to start for this: go there and tick the 'ecoCard' box in the 'Payment methods' section. You can then sort these according to their different types. To see deposit bonuses, for example, choose the 'Deposit Bonus' box in the 'Bonus Type' section. You'll get the same results by going to our list of deposit bonuses and selecting the 'EcoCard' box there.</p>
