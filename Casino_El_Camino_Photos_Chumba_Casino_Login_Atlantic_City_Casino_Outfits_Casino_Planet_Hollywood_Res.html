    <h1>Casino El Camino Photos Chumba Casino Login Atlantic City Casino Outfits Casino Planet Hollywood Res</h1>

<p>thank you I agree with the fact that a rule was broken here is my issue I couldn’t find the place to look to see how much rollover I have left or my progress. It is takes awhile to navigate the site and locate it so I was playing with my friend and he said buy a bonus and if it lets you buy it you are through the play through so we did and it lost money like $120 so we played awhile longer and bought one more for $100 on this game and that lost $40. Other then those 2 bonus buys my bets were very conservative we had fun hit some nice bonuses and would probably end up redepositing our winnings plus more so not sure why the casino wants to lose a couple of losing players who enjoy playing not so much in it to make a profit.</p>
<p>So I understand that it would make sense that if those had been used to try and complete the rollover quickly or hit a big profit that’s bonus abuse, but i played well over the requirements and only was betting max of $4 a spin mostly $1 or $2. I am a losing player they are beating me pretty good but i play for fun and if I’m some kind of cheater then why do I lose 95% of my deposits? The punishment for that didn’t fit the crime in my opinion it was to take away all of my winnings for the session?</p>
<p>I think there is a way to treat your customers when an honest mistake has been made and I am just wanting to give them an opportunity to reconsider or possibly offer some kind of compromise because I do like the site and up until now had great interaction with customer service.</p>
