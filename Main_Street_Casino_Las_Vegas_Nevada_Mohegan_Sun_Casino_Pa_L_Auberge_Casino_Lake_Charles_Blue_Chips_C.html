    <h1>Main Street Casino Las Vegas Nevada Mohegan Sun Casino Pa L Auberge Casino Lake Charles Blue Chips C</h1>

<p>Hello. I registered with latest or casinoguru or askgamblers in this casino via vpn, since it is not possible to enter the latest forum or casinoguru or askgamblers without vpn. On June 24, I decided to make a deposit for a 100% bonus + 50 free spins for a total of 41.63 usd, before making a deposit, I asked all the information in support - is this bonus available to me? they saw perfectly that I was Russian. After the deposit, the bonus was successfully credited. I went to go into the game and then I see this error...</p>
<p>Unfortunately this game appears to be restricted for your country by the game provider.</p>
<p>If you have any questions please contact our Support Team.</p>
<p>And in all the games of all providers such an error ... I looked at more than 100 slots, I decided to open the game through vpn, it opened.</p>
<p>I started asking in support what is the problem? he said that not all providers of all games are available for your country, so far they have seen that I am from Russia, but they have not written anything.</p>
<p>As a result, my account for the game was blocked. And they said to wait for the results, yesterday I uploaded all the documents to them - a passport, an account statement not older than 3 months, a selfie with a passport, a residence permit.</p>
<p>They told me to wait, there is a trial. I'm tired of waiting for you!</p>
<p>This is your mistake, since Russia was in the list of countries for registering an account, also Russia is still in my profile</p>
<p>Also, access to https://www.richardcasino.com/en does not block Russia and does not give an error when you click on registration that Russia is banned from playing, Russia is also selected in the icon of the list of countries for registration</p>
<p>You also have mirror access, although everything goes smoothly with a direct link. https://www.richardcasino5.com/</p>
<p>In general, I have already been waiting for the return of the 2nd day - the mistake is exclusively yours that you did not remove Russia from the registration icon and did not block access for registration.</p>
<p>how will you make a refund if my account has an active first deposit bonus of 100% + 50 free spins, if you cancel it, all funds will burn. Please make a refund of my deposit of 41.63 USD to my litecoin wallet from which I made a deposit. I will be at work tonight, today I definitely need a refund from you! Here is my litecoin that needs a refund from which I made a deposit LNocNVh3XmmnwPHTbmWkaBh7GHXAskp8i2</p>
