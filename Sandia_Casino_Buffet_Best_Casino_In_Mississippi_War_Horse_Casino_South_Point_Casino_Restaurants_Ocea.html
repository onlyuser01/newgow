    <h1>Sandia Casino Buffet Best Casino In Mississippi War Horse Casino South Point Casino Restaurants Ocea</h1>

<p>There has been a lot of uncertainty surrounding the latest UFC bout. After the schedule had to be pushed back a bit, UFC 249 is finally returning on May 9 in Jacksonville, Florida and a total of 12 matches are planned for viewers – 7 prelims or undercard bouts, and 5 fights on the main card, including Tony Ferguson vs Justin Gaethje.</p>
<p>It’s this particular event we are interested in today, as Ferguson and Gaethje’s bout is the most important one, and that’s the one we will take a closer look at. At the same time, UFC 251 has been postponed, much to the disappointment of Dana White, who’s been keeping the can-do attitude on.</p>
<p>When and Where Is UFC 249 Taking Place?</p>
<p>Date : Saturday, May 9</p>
<p>: Saturday, May 9 Time : 10:00 pm EST</p>
<p>: 10:00 pm EST Location :VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena</p>

<p>UFC 249 Betting Odds: Ferguson vs. Gaethje</p>
<p>Tony Ferguson (-199)</p>
<p>Justin Gaethje (+174)</p>
<p>If the odds are anything to go by, Tony Ferguson is definitely coming in hot here with (-199). This is about as much of a sure winner as you can get when it comes to sportsbooks. And why wouldn’t the bookies rally behind Ferguson? The man is coming in on a 12-fight winning streak, and one that most experts agree, Gaethje is just not very likely to upset.</p>
<p>Ferguson’s last defeat was back on May 5, 2012 (he lost to Michael Johnson) and today stands at the impressive 25-3. The man has put some mileage in the UFC. He even forced Kevin Lee to tap out at UFC 216 and won the lightweight belt, but had to give up the title, because he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the part of the knee that helps the joint rotate.</p>
<p>Ferguson has been raking up an impressive list of victories, including his successes versus Anthony Pettis in UFC 229 and then, not too long after, he defeated Donald Cerrone in UFC 238 by technical knockout. The list of defeated opponents goes on and on, with Edson Barbaroza and Josh Thomson two of the other opponents to have suffered a defeat to Ferguson.</p>
<p>Ferguson Vs. Gaethje 36 Age 31 5’11” Height 5’11” 76.5” Reach 70” 11 Stats 4</p>
<p>Then you have Justin Gaethje. The man is a showman through and through. His lightsome attitude in the Octagon could be misleading, and while the odds put him much below Ferguson one can’t help but wonder – is that really justified? Gaethje’s record is not at all bad – 21-2, and even though he has only won three times in a row since his last loss, it seems a bit of a stretch to give him such long odds just yet.</p>
<p>Gaethje has beaten pretty much the same opponents as has Ferguson. Well, more or less. There is certainly Cerrone and Barboza there, so by that same token, the man is solid.</p>
<p>It’s Either a KO for Gaethje or Submission for Ferguson</p>
<p>Some seem to suggest that they are already pretty sure what would happen. And so, on the one hand, you have Ferguson who’s known for his endurance. The guy can go the distance and when the opponent is starting to wear off, that’s when Ferguson submits them.</p>
<p>But “El Cucuy” has an aggressive, guns-a-blaze fighting style that often helps him land incapacitating hooks early on and pretty much wrap up the bout before anyone has had much time to settle in. Ferguson definitely seems in better shape, but Gaethje really wants to get back in the ring with Nurmagomedov and to do that, he will have to steamroll Ferguson.</p>
<p>Despite his somewhat less impressive form, we believe El Cucuy can make it back in the Octagon against Nurmagomedov and that Ferguson will lose this one. And besides, he recently said that he is “fighting Nurmagomedov next.”</p>
<p>Pick Justin “El Cucuy” Gaethje</p>
