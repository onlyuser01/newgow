<p>Sportradar, a multinational sports data specialist, has unveiled a new partnership with the Caribbean Premier League. The deal will allow the data company to collect and deliver sports data from the league and power various betting products and services.</p>
<p>Sportradar Reiterates Commitment to Pro Cricket</p>
<p>Sportradar was chosen as an official data partner, official betting streaming partner and official integrity partner of the Hero Caribbean Premier League, Massy Women’s Caribbean Premier League and the SKYEXCH 6IXTY competitions. Sportradar was selected among its competitors through a tender, which it ended up winning.</p>
<p>As a result, Sportradar will now collect and distribute sports data from the aforementioned leagues. The said data will power various media and sports betting companies. The sports data company hopes to provide customers with more data-points from each Caribbean Premier League than ever before. It also promised to provide audio-visual streaming content from 38 Caribbean Premier League matches and 19 6IXTY matches a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sportradar will power the Caribbean Premier League with a new Match Centre that will deliver live scores, ball-by-ball commentary, game summaries, scorings and various other insights. As announced by Sportradar, the ball-by-ball commentary is an innovative feature that leverages the company’s AI-powered solutions to deliver relevant live data. Sportradar will also use its AI capabilities to boost the league’s integrity and protect it from wagering fraud via the Universal Fraud Detection System.</p>
<p>The Caribbean League Welcomed Sportradar</p>
<p>The Caribbean Premier League’s head of marketing Chris Watson commented on the deal. He said that he is glad to welcome Sportradar as the official partner of the Hero Caribbean Premier League, Massy Women’s Caribbean Premier League and SKYEXCH 6IXTY and praised the data provider for its cutting-edge Match Centre.</p>
<p>Their unrivaled Match Centre gives fans the ability to follow matches from our tournaments wherever they are which is another way we can bring our fantastic supporters even closer to the action. Chris Watson, head of marketing, Caribbean Premier League</p>
<p>Eric Conrad, Sportradar’s managing director of strategic partnerships and content, also commented on the matter. He is sure that Sportradar will be able to vastly improve the Caribbean Premier League’s global visibility and help it grow. According to him, the sports data company will channel up to 2.5 billion cricket enthusiasts toward the league.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be able to support the League and its athletes in reaching a new, global audience. Eric Conrad, MD, Sportradar</p>
