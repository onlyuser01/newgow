<p>Ahead of Sunday’s Premier League clash between Manchester City and Liverpool, there’s only one point separating the two. The reigning EPL champion – Man City – is at the top of the table, meaning that it’s the Reds from Merseyside who need to go for a win.</p>
<p>Beating Man City is a Herculean task on its own, let alone doing it at Etihad Stadium in Manchester. The proof of this is that Liverpool’s done it only twice in the past ten years. Can Jurgen Klopp’s boys do it again? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Anything But a Loss Works for Pep Guardiola’s Team</p>
<p>The Manchester City vs Liverpool game is played in the Premier League Round 32, but both of these teams have played 30 games so far. What this means is that each team has to play another eight EPL games before the end of the season. This includes Sunday’s match, which is, by far, the hardest, for both teams.</p>
<p>After the clash with Liverpool, Manchester City has a relatively easy schedule in the Prem, with its toughest opponent being West Ham in the penultimate round. What this means is that it wouldn’t be surprising if Pep Guardiola’s team won all of those games.</p>
<p>Knowing this, their future looks good. However, everything can go sideways if they lose to Liverpool on Sunday. In that case, the Reds would get to two points more. With a draw at Etihad, things would remain the same. But with a win over Liverpool, Manchester City would practically win themselves another title.</p>
<p>Liverpool Needs to be Taken Seriously</p>
<p>Even though oddsmakers are leaning towards Manchester City in this game, Liverpool mustn’t be underestimated. After all, this team has been playing fantastic soccer since the start of 2022.</p>
<p>In fact, the Reds have lost just one game this year. It happened against Inter Milan in the second leg of the Champions League Round of 16 when Liverpool had a comfortable lead from the first leg. Speaking of the Champions League, Liverpool played a quarterfinal game against Sporting last Tuesday, winning 3-1 on the road.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Premier League, Liverpool has all wins since January 2. That’s ten straight wins in the top English flight.</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Liverpool Prediction</p>
<p>It’s going to be a real barnburner, probably with plenty of goals. But which team is going to be happier when the ref blows the final whistle? No one should be surprised if it’s Liverpool. Not only are the Reds in fantastic form but this is a must-win for them.</p>
<p>Picks: Liverpool to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
