    <h1>Casino Bonus Codes Horseshoe Casino Hammond Indiana War Horse Casino Lincoln New Jersey Casinos Choc</h1>

<p>I won $6767.40 on a $100 free chip I got in a email. I made all the requirements and stipulations of the bonus. I wagered the $5000 that was required and made another $5000 in winnings. I tried the withdrawal but wouldn't let me because of the bonus. I just stated that I had to cancel the bonus to withdraw all withdrawalable winnings. I cancelled the bonus and it took back the $100 it gave me to play with. When I went back to make the withdrawal it said my withdrawalable balance was $4500. And it let my withdrawal it all. I live chatted with the casino shortly after the withdrawal was pending to see what all I needed to make the withdrawal go smoothly. I was told all I had to do is make a $20 deposit and send a pic of my driver's license. I did both within the next few days. I was then told it will go through a 48 hour review and if they need anything more they would contact me through email. And the money would be in my account 3 to 5 days after the review. I heard nothing or no email after the 48 hour review so everything is all good right? Wrong! After about 10 days of constantly checking my account not a penny. So I contacted customer service to see what's the hold up. I was then told sense I wanted a Bitcoin withdrawal I needed to make another $20 deposit using Bitcoin. After that the $6767.40 would be all mine. No problem. But 5 days later and still no deposit of winnings into my bank. So I call instead of messaging. Now they are saying I can't get my winnings because of terms and conditions. I meant all the terms and conditions of the bonus and even after cancelling the bonus still had the money in my account. So give me my damn winnings. I spent all my savings thinking I was told this was a lagit casino and I would get the winnings. Even got me to pay $20 two separate times. What a sucker! So now I'm out $2500 in savings and $40 they suckered me into giving their casino. I have screenshots of the withdrawal and there emails so I think talking to a lawyer is my next step. Don't waist your money at this casino. There are so many more "legit" casinos out there you don't need to waste your money or time at this one.</p>
