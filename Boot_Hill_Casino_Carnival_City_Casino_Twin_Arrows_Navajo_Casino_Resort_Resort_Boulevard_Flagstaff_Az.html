    <h1>Boot Hill Casino Carnival City Casino Twin Arrows Navajo Casino Resort Resort Boulevard Flagstaff Az</h1>

<p>The GamblingNews podcasts have seen a massive response since being introduced around two months ago. They regularly discuss the gaming industry with individuals from all facets of operations, and Rory Kimber, the Account Management and Marketing Director for Malta-based 1X2 Network, joined us to discuss how the gaming software company is pioneering the space.</p>
<p>Throughout his extensive career, which began with Paddy Power years ago, Kimber has been somewhat of a lucky charm for his employers. Each has ultimately merged with another that led to a significant profit for the company, but 1X2 Network isn’t looking to be purchased. It is, instead, setting the pace for all gaming developers, remaining at the forefront of HTML5 development, with a varied portfolio of sports games, table games and slots.</p>
<p>Despite the company’s extensive history, there are always new challenges that have to be met and overcome. 1X2 Network was recently approved to offer its services in Greece, which required a great deal of paperwork and regulatory scrutiny. However, the company emerged victorious and is already seeing a significant response to its entry.</p>
<p>Because the iGaming space is becoming more competitive, operators need an edge to win over customers. This is where technologies such as HTML5, artificial intelligence and others come into play. By leveraging innovation, 1X2 Network is able to develop solutions that can be easily integrated into different platforms quickly, allowing operators to capitalize quicker on their investment and beat the competition.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, as 1X2 Network continues to expand, it will explore options in Latin America. The region is ripe for explosive iGaming and sports betting growth, but has to have a local flair to the content provided. This is where 1X2 Network excels and where Kimber expects the company to focus a significant portion of its resources going forward.</p>
