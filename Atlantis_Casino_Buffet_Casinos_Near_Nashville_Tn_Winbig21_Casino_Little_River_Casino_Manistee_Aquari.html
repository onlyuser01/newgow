<p>AffPapa, the host behind one of the fastest-growing industry get-togethers, iGaming Club, has announced a new instalment in the series, indicative of the event’s success so far and the sustained interest in it.</p>
<p>The networking gathering has quickly grown to prominence among iGaming specialists who are looking eagerly forward to the new editions of the event, and AffPapa now has another stop to add to the calendar with iGaming Club Conference Malaga 2024, taking place on May 26 through May 28.</p>
<p>Hosted in Malaga, Spain, at the NH Hotel Malaga, the event is expected to gather more than 800 affiliates, operators, and B2B providers, and will come with its signature opportunity to network, schmooze, and exchange know-how between participants. Once again, AffPapa is focusing on breaking the ice and nudging communication by developing clever social lubricant activities.</p>
<p>Among those are the speed-dating sessions, dynamic panel discussions, networking drinks and activities, and not least – the third annual AffPapa iGaming Awards Ceremony, which will seek to distinguish the best and brightest in the industry. The newly announced conference was welcomed by AffPapa CEO and Co-Founder Levon Nikoghosyan who was very excited to see yet another gathering added to iGaming Club’s sprawling legacy. He said:</p>
<p>"I am delighted to announce our flagship event, the iGaming Club Malaga Conference 2024. This has been a long time coming, driven by the demand and positive feedback from our previous events. It’s a natural progression of what we’ve already built on — expect two days of intensive networking and connecting the best minds in the industry."</p>
<p>Malaga is just one of the confirmed locations for the year. The most anticipated gathering in the format right now is the one that is taking place in London, the United Kingdom on February 6. More details about iGaming Club events will be forthcoming this year.</p>
