<p>Duel of the Dead Megaways review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Duel of the Dead Megaways mixes a Western theme with zombies. The slot is set in a dusty old town that has seemingly been overrun with the undead.</p>
<p>Standing in their way is a selection of cowboy characters, all of which seem to have drawn inspiration from the popular Django Unchained movie. While never specifically referenced, characters look uncannily similar to the ones portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Kalamba sets a dark tone with the design of the Duel of the Dead Megaways slot game. This would be more in line with slots like Tombstone RIP than the more zany Western offerings like Peter &amp; Son’s Wild Duel.</p>
<p>The backdrop for the slot is an abandoned old town in the Wild West, with one-half of the screen displaying a graveyard shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>The game, ironically, really comes to life with the zombie animations. The shoot-out sequences are a lot of fun to watch, and the character design is brilliant. Plenty of fun sound effects accompany these sequences to further immerse players.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>As a Megaways slot, you will find six reels in each base game spin of Duel of the Dead Megaways. Each reel can display between two and seven symbols, except the sixth one, which can only display four. This is a result of a locked set of symbols in the bottom corner that can feature in the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>As a result, the number of ways to win is reduced from the standard 117,649 found in a Megaways slot down to 84,035.</p>
<p>All of the controls for the game are found around the spin button. The stake is adjusted by clicking on the stack of coins icon, and there are autospin and turbo features available.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Duel of the Dead Megaways comes with some top bonus features. The features are all focused around the central storyline, and the slot uses a shoot-out feature similar to the ones seen in titles like Wanted: Dead or a Wild.</p>
<p>The Zombies Go Wild feature can trigger on any random spin when the Sheriff lands on the first reel. She then expands, and all symbols on reels 2-5 are turned into Zombie symbols. She will then start shooting at the symbols for a period of time. When a Zombie is hit, its multiplier increases by one. When the round finishes, all of the Zombies turn Wild with their multipliers attached, and wins are calculated.</p>
<p>The slot ups the ante when Deadeye Bob, the locked prisoner on reel six, becomes active during the Zombies Go Wild feature. The Sheriff and Bob both shoot across the reels. Whenever Bob is hit, up to three multipliers are added to random Zombies. When Bob hits the Sheriff, the feature ends.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also a Free Spins bonus that is triggered when you land three or more Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The Duel of the Dead Megaways slot has a really attractive maths model. When you load the slot up, you are greeted by the news that a maximum win of 20,000x your stake is available. The slot also boasts a high RTP of 96.22% and is considered highly volatile. High volatility slots are a key part of our slot strategy and are always something we are happy to see.</p>
<p>The stake is adjusted by clicking on the coins icon, and a minimum bet of $0.20 and a maximum of $50 are available.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Duel of the Dead Megaways is another fine entry into the Western slot genre. Kalamba has loaded this game up with some great bonus features and some excellent winning potential that will please players. The slot’s design is also great, though the decision to model characters so closely on Django Unchained feels a little odd. Overall, though, this is a fantastic offering from Kalamba that we are happy to recommend.</p>
