<p>EveryMatrix has been robustly building up its footprint in the North American iGaming landscaping, making sure that it moves at a confident pace across the vertical which in turn promises to be the next big thing across the region, with talks in New York about the potential legalization of online casinos intensifying.</p>
<p>Now, EveryMatrix has got an official go-ahead from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) to provide its offer in the Keystone State and bring a variety of opportunities to local iGaming operators. Besides Pennsylvania, EveryMatrix holds licenses in Connecticut, NewJersey, Michigan, West Virginia, and up north in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The company will deploy its iGaming content aggregator and offer licensed PGCB websites the opportunity to dive into a variety of games designed to improve the user experience and deliver on impeccable and worthwhile options for players.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix President of Americas Erik Nyman has welcomed the opportunity to see his company secure this new license, as the company’s foothold in the region, and iGaming specifically, expands. He also outlined the significance of the move for the year ahead.</p>
<p>"This is a great start to 2024. We will continue to roll out our games portfolio and aggregation services to fill both the content gap while also adding rich bonus and gamification features that will be completely new to the US market," Nyman noted.</p>
<p>Nyman is confident in the opportunities that the PGCB would present to existing and new EveryMatrix clients who will have the opportunity to build and expand their libraries with unique and impactful content facilitated by EveryMatrix.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix has been steadily building its iGaming footprint in the United States over the past several months. The company signed up with Caesars Sportsbook to deploy its range of online casino products for the brand’s gaming platform, with games such as Book of Armadillo, Fortune Dragon Queen Exotic Wilds, The Lioness, and others among the featured titles.</p>
<p>A similar partnership was struck with betPARX which has benefited from SlotMatrix’s ample selection of studio partners and games since last October. EveryMatrix is keen to continue growing its offer exponentially and provide players with new opportunities, while also ensuring that it secures partnerships with prominent gaming operators. The move to Pennsylvania would allow it to pursue this goal relentlessly into the new year.</p>
