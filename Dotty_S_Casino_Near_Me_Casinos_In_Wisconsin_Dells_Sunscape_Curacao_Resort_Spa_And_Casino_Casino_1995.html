    <h1>Dotty S Casino Near Me Casinos In Wisconsin Dells Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa And Casino Casino 1995</h1>

<p>I deposited almost 20,000 and never withdrew anything. Then I was lucky and already had 80,000 profit on the account. The verification of the account is pure chicane. Three times the same sent then after 2 days they managed to verify. I then immediately gave the Max 4000 for payout. During the day I continued to play with the usual high stakes. In the early evening I was locked out and got an email that my winnings had been confiscated for violating the bonus scheme. I've never activated a bonus because I know and can't play many games. I sent this back by email. The supporter said cheekily, yes, I know the management made it different for you and added a bonus that I was playing for. He says I agreed to the bonus rules through the reorganization. According to the terms and conditions, they are allowed to. The 4000 were also not paid out even though I gave the payout in the morning. . You haven't had a bonus at all. They didn't answer this question, nor did they send an email, my case was checked again and everything was legally confiscated. I think that was already planned with the sneaky bonus because I was surprised that the 4000 in the afternoon were still being processed even though my account was verified.? You don't pay out big winnings just for the casino itself. This is completely criminal and just luckily has nothing more to do. And they got 20,000 deposits. I did not transfer 1 euro</p>
