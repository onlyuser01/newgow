    <h1>Sweepstake Casino Lightning Casino Casino Cerca De Mi Ubicaci n Lucky Block Casino California Hotel</h1>

<p>Hi, so I had 3 withdrawls submitted at paradise8 casino cuz I was entering them whenever the casino allowed me to ( the amount available to withdraw would change from 0 to 0- whatever max they were allowing me at the time). Guessing their withdrawl limits allowed only a certain amount in certain time frames so they are spread out. So on January 7th I entered the max amount for bitcoin withdrawal which was $598.15. Weird amount but that's what I was allowed. On the bonus I took, i know that $200 in bonus funds I had to give back out of that and it would only be for around $400. On the 8th I was allowed to enter another withdrawl, max of 400 so that's what I did. Then I wasnt allowed to submit another one until the 14th which I did for the max it let me which was $599. So all 3 pending withdrawals equaled about 1600 - 200 bonus funds they would be taking out so about $1400 is what I should have been paid out. On January 15th I received $830 in one bitcoin payout from them and all 3 pending withdrawals went away so they screwed me out of about $570 after taking their $200 back in bonus funds. I emailed them immediately on the 15th and asked them what's going on and they never replied. I sent another email a couple mornings ago on the 19th and still no reply. I still have another $400 in my account and I've been checking daily and they still arent giving me the option of withdrawing it. It's been so long that I know they are avoiding me. When I've emailed them previously with questions they always replied within 3 days. I'm hoping you guys can help me get my money back. You guys were able to help me get a withdrawl from a different site a year or so ago and hoping you can do the same cuz I think you guys are my only hope unless theres other sites that do the same as you and I can try them next if you cant. But I'm coming back here first cuz I know you guys are legit. If you cant help me get the rest of my payout atleast you can put the word out for people to be cautious using their site if they dont pay the rest. thanks in advance, I appreciate you guys and will be looking forward to hearing back from someone.</p>
