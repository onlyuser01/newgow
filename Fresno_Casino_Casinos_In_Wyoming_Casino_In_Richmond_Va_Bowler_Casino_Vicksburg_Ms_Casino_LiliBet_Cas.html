    <h1>Fresno Casino Casinos In Wyoming Casino In Richmond Va Bowler Casino Vicksburg Ms Casino LiliBet Cas</h1>

<p>hi. my username at Lilibet is T****e (for you dear Lilibet customer service agants) At Lilibet casino I paid $10 on 22/03/2022 04:49 via Skrill, and then again $10 deposit via Skrill on 23/03/2022 06:35. After I played, my balance increased to $43. At this point I made a witdrawal request 25/03/2022 03:26. Same day on 25/03/2022 I have uploaded the required verification documents, my selfie, my online profile, my proof of address and my photo ID. All of them was accepted by the Lilibet system, except the backside of my ID card. Tha's because there is the issue date there on the backside, and it was issued in 2020, so the system did not accepted it. Error message says: Identity card rejected. However the police here in Hungary and all the authorities do accept my ID when I need to identify myself. I am a law abiding citizen and that is my valid ID card. Ask anyone in Hungary, you'll see, there is the issue date on the back of the ID card. After this I have sent my documents again in email to the Lilibet support. They answered:" Dear Istv√°n,</p>
<p>We are contacting you regarding your account.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that your account must be verified in our system.</p>
<p>Please log into your account, click on your profile picture in the upper right corner, and select the "ID Verification" option.</p>
<p>Select Start Verification to begin the verification process. Please follow the on-screen instructions to upload your documents.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Verification Team"</p>
<p>So they don't understand my problem. That is I'm stuck. When I click there, to the my account/ID verification" button, see the attached screenshots.</p>
<p>So I am unable to continue the verification on their website. I wrote email again to the verification team and waiting for their manual verification team with all my required documents attached in email. I would like to cashout my small $43 prize.</p>
<p>And here's my $43 that I'm going to get from them.</p>
<p>I just want them to manually verify my account and pay me this little win.</p>
<p>Best Regards: A new Lilibet customer.</p>
