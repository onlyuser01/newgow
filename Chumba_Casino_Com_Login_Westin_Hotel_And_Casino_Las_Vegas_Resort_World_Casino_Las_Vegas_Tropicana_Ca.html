<p>Helle team.</p>
<p>During the whole time of this complaint, we have tried many times to get this bug on our side. But it has never worked.</p>
<p>The technical team could not do it either.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, we can advise you not to play this slot. That's what we told you at the beginning - until the problem is completely solved, we would not advise you to play this slot. But you have continued to play anyway, despite the warning.</p>
<p>We can't disable the game for just one account in the casino, and we have no other complaints, and all checks indicate that there are no problems either.</p>
<p>First mention of the issue had been made on 06.11.2022 where the player had been asked to make the basic troubleshooting steps. After which the customer had contacted us saying that the issue still persists. Initial case was passed to the technical team and they had checked the players account and could not locate the isssue and had informed that there are no issues associated with the game provider.</p>
<p>Player later had closed her account for a week on 11.11.2022 and came back regarding having the same issue on 20.11.2022 after what the ticket was passed to the platform technical team on 20.11.2022 regarding the player being logged out of his account after attempting to close the game Temple Tumble, but whilst doing so she received an error and the Visual would show as she is logged out, but in reality she would remain logged in to his account.</p>
<p>On 25.11.2022 the technical team had said that the issue had been fixed and the cause had been an issue with a broken script.</p>
<p>On 29.11.2022 they had asked us to provide them with a video recording from the player side where the issue could be visible as we had mentioned to them that the issue is still existant.</p>
<p>Player did not provide us with a video or a reply till 12.12.2022</p>
<p>On 18.12.2022 the player had provided the requested videos where we could see the issue.</p>
<p>Between 19.12.2022 and 11.01.2023 we had asked for multiple updates regarding the case as it should not take that long and on 11.01.2023 we had been provided witht he following reply â€“ Due to the uniqueness of the case the investigation is complicated and they are still working on the issue.</p>
<p>Between 11.01.2023 and 01.02.2023 we had once again asked for updates on many occassion yet none besides we are working on the issue had been provided.</p>
<p>On 01.02.2023 technical team had informed us that they had finally understood the source of the issue and on 03.02.2023 they had informed that the potential fix is ready, but they are not able to release it yet as it would impact other changes.</p>
<p>On 06.02.2023 client had not been able to login to her account, but after password reset she had been able to do so.</p>
<p>On 14.02.2023 they had made an update that should fix the issue after which the customer had contacted us on 24.02.2023 and mentioned that she is no longer been able to login to her account again.</p>
<p>Technical team, had first implied that there had been no issue and the player should try to reset password and check SPAM folder, but later had informed us that there had been no reset link sent due to an issue with service queues.</p>
<p>Between 01.03.2023 and 06.03.2023 we had not received any updates from the user regarding if she is experiencing any other issues.</p>
<p>On 09.03.2023 she had informed us that she has been able to change his password and login to his account, but had not mentioned if the issue with Temple Tumble game remains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we are heavily reliant on the platform in case of such issues we are not able to fix them as quickly as we would desire. The customer has been aware of the issue from the start as well as had mentioned that she is playing at her own rish and with her own responsibility, but had proceeded with the gameplay willingly.</p>
<p>At the moment we have sent a repeat request for inspection, but as we can expect the result will be the same.</p>
<p>We always deal with problems of any nature very clearly. Here - the problem is that we can't find anything, it complicates any process.</p>
<p>As before, at this point I can only advise against playing this slot.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Andrei</p>
