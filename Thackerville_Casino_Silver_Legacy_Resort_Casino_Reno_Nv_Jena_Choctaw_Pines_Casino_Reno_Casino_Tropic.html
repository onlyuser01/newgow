    <h1>Thackerville Casino Silver Legacy Resort Casino Reno Nv Jena Choctaw Pines Casino Reno Casino Tropic</h1>

<p>There is a serious issue with this casino I will start from the top.</p>
<p>Upon completing wagering requirement 2 months ago I was told a $25 deposit was necessary to verify my litecoin account for transaction. Took me a few weeks but I finally deposited the correct amount.</p>
<p>First red flag: When I sent more than enough litecoin to casino deposit address it showed as $24.65 right below $25 which is real strange seeing how my crypto exchange/wallet tells me the exact amount the would receive after I paid gas fees. There should've been no more charges, so I checked the blockchain and sure enough there was an anomaly on their end. They took just enough to put it below $25 before putting it into my account. But that wasn't an issue one customer rep assured me. Still raised a brow on my end because what did they do with the rest of that change they took.</p>
<p>Nearly two weeks pass because they claimed now I had to kyc my account again when I was already verified before making a deposit. In fact, the only reason I found out I had to deposit $25 is because I wasn't told this until after I kyc'd. 2nd red flag</p>
<p>So eventually after kyc for the 2nd time I put in for a withdrawal $180+$20=$200 out of the account. Took them nearly four days to send me an email saying that I wagered over $10 while playing with a bonus. Which is an absolute lie because I never wager that high and I have more evidence they make this up to confiscate winnings unlawfully. In the email it stated my winnings were voided and my deposit returned back to my account.</p>
<p>Needless to say heart dropped, they completely ripped me off. I went to my account and sure enough they took the $180 and left me a little over $25 which I could not withdrawal because the minimum is $100. So I decided to email about my deposit they never responded. So I went back in to burn the deposit money so they wouldn't keep it. I ended up winning up to $144.00 in a matter of minutes wagering $1.00 and only $1.00 every spin purposely.</p>
<p>So yet again I went to withdrawal, and wanted to see what excuse would they have this time. And beyond my absolute reasoning and thought process they took my winnings again. Then used the same reason that I wagered over $10 while playing. I was so infuriated by thus blatant lie I had to set my down for awhile. And not only did they take the new winnings I just won this time, but also my deposit and left my account at $0.05. I haven't heard from them since despite my email attempts. Customer service just ignores me or they end the session early with repeated pre-text.</p>
<p>I have two emails from them claiming I requested a reverse on both of my withdrawals which is also completely untrue and their attempt at a cover up. I have screenshots proving everything. They were a bit slow editing my account to fit their story. I am highly disappointed in this casino and the individuals who operate in this manner at thus casino as well. I'm sure I will never see any of my winnings or my deposit.</p>
