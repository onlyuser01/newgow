<p>WPT Host Lynn Gilmartin has raised nearly $30,000 in support of Australian wildlife who have been affected by the recent bushfires.</p>
<p>WPT Host Raises Nearly $30K for Australian Wildlife</p>
<p>Lynn Gilmartin, a host for the World Poker Tour has launched a fundraiser to help animals that are in danger due to the Australian bushfires. In just three days, the initiative has raised over $20,000 from players across the poker community.</p>
<p>“The generosity we’ve seen from the poker community for many causes over the years has been extraordinary. Now, Australia needs some of that kindness”, reads a statement from the page.</p>
<p>Initially, Gilmartin hoped to raise just $5000 when she started the fundraiser earlier this week. Now, just a few days later, over 240 donors have contributed AU$28,000 to the cause. Many players have donated, and even Kitty Kuo has stated that she will pledge some of her winnings from the Aussie Millions event.</p>
<p>Money Raised for the Wildlife Warriors</p>
<p>All of the money raised via Gilmartin’s fundraiser will be contributed to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors, an organization founded by Terri Irwin and her late husband Steve Irwin in 2002. Its goal is to be the most effective wildlife conservation organisation in the world.</p>
<p>Donations collected by the Wildlife Warriors goes to help a number of causes in support of caring for animals around the world. The Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital is one such cause, which looks after a wide variety of animals, like possums, koalas and various reptiles. Over the years, more than 75,000 animals have been treated at the hospital.</p>
<p>There is also the Rescue Unit, which is very busy at the moment. Funds contributed to the unit goes towards tools that help volunteers rescue animals from dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Many species across Australia have been threatened – koalas in particular. Since the fires started last year, one-third of the koala population has been wiped out.</p>
<p>In times like these, it’s important that wildlife care charities receive assistance. So, Gilmartin has chosen a very worthwhile cause, as the Australia bushfires continue to endanger the lives of Australians and Australian animals.</p>
