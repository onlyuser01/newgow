For ring winners, there will be one more prize – a seat at the WSOP Million Dollar Freeroll, a $1 million guaranteed freeroll tournament in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In 2020, the WSOP Winter Online Circuit attracted huge interest as over 85,000 online poker players participated in the ring events running from December 13, 2020, through January 10, 2021.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the tournament series, winner of one WSOP ring and six WSOP bracelets and GGPoker Global Ambassador Daniel Negreanu could not hide his excitement at the opportunities the series offer to every player to “win a big prize and gold ring, while enjoying a taste of the WSOP experience.”</p>
<p>“This time around, there’s also the not-insignificant matter of $100,000,000 in prizes to enjoy as well; it might be getting cold outside, but the action is just heating up at GGPoker.” Daniel Negreanu, Global Ambassador, GGPoker</p>
<p>One hundred of the best and most consistent players at the series will get a chance to grab a piece of the $100,000 Series Leaderboard prize pool as each entry into a tournament or a side event of the series will be rewarded with points.</p>
