<p>The provider of live casino, slots and virtual sports games, powering the iGaming industry, Pragmatic Play, announced a new Latin American-facing partnership. The company confirmed Tuesday it joined forces with Betmais, a leading online gambling operator in Brazil. Per the freshly minted agreement, Pragmatic Play agreed to supply a wide range of its games, supercharging the operator's offering. Thanks to the new deal, Betmais' customers in the country will be able to access Virtual Sports, Live Casino, as well as slots games provided by Pragmatic Play.</p>
<p>The iGaming provider's Virtual Sports products stand out with cutting-edge 3D renderings. Such titles include greyhound and horse racing, as well as Pragmatic Play's fan-favorite Force 1 product. The leading content provider's Live Casino titles are also going to become available for customers of the Brazilian operator. Such titles include proven casino classic hits like roulette and blackjack, along with innovative gameshow-style games like Snakes and Ladders Live and Sweet Bonanza Candyland, among others.</p>
<p>As noted, the deal encompasses games from Pragmatic Play's Slots portfolio. Thanks to the new content agreement, Betmais' clients will benefit from recent player-favorites like Infective Wild, Twilight Princess, as well as award-winning titles like Sugar Rush and Gates of Olympus. Overall, Pragmatic Play offers more than 300 unique slot games that deliver unrivaled entertainment.</p>
<p>Livia Troise, Betmais' CEO, shared her excitement in a statement explaining: "Pragmatic Play is one of the leading purveyors of iGaming experiences in the world and we are delighted to now populate our platform with its Slots, Live Casino and Virtual Sports products." Finally, she said: "It is already a household name among players in the Latin American region and we know its games will spawn an overwhelmingly positive response from our players."</p>
<p>Victor Arias, Vice President of Latin American Operations at ARRISE powering Pragmatic Play, spoke about the importance of the Latin American region for the company. He said that Pragmatic Play continues to expand its portfolio of partners in the region, offering unique games. Finally, Arias said: "Pragmatic Play is committed to delivering top-quality content and innovative gaming solutions, and this collaboration reinforces its dedication to becoming the premier supplier in the region."</p>
<p>The deal with Betmais complements the positive momentum gained by Pragmatic Play in Latin America. It enables its unique games to reach new customers while at the same time solidifying its presence as a go-to provider. Earlier this year, Pragmatic Play inked a content deal with Vem Betar, another prominent operator for the regulated gambling vertical in Brazil.</p>
