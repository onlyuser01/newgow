<p>Players using poker machines must now utilize swipe cards to set enforceable restrictions on both their financial losses and the duration of their gambling sessions</p>
<p>Crown Melbourne has declared its commitment to becoming the world’s safest casino with the help of a groundbreaking initiative that comes in the form of a new carded play system.</p>
<p>The casino, once embroiled in controversy following the 2021 Finkelstein royal commission, has announced that poker machine players will now be required to use swipe cards to establish binding limits on both losses and time spent gambling.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts chief executive, Ciaran Carruthers, expressed the casino’s ambition to operate the safest casinos globally, emphasizing the transformative nature of this pioneering shift, reported the Australian media outlet The Age.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, patrons utilizing Crown Melbourne’s 2500 poker machines will need to employ a swipe card to determine their maximum allowable losses and set time constraints. This innovative approach aims to promote responsible gambling and empower players to manage their gaming activities more conscientiously.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will receive detailed player activity statements, providing insights into their ongoing spending and playing habits. This move is part of Crown Melbourne’s commitment to fostering an environment of transparency and responsibility.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts Unveils Ambitious Plans for Statewide Gaming Reform</p>
<p>The new system is not limited to Crown Melbourne alone. Plans are underway to extend it to the state’s other 26,380 poker machines in pubs, clubs, and RSLs.</p>
<p>This development coincides with a challenging period for the casino, as recent reports indicate an investigation into allegations that CEO Ciaran Carruthers intervened to permit blocked patrons to gamble.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts, having faced a substantial $100 million fine last year for allowing prolonged gambling at its Southbank complex, remains under scrutiny for past practices. This year, Crown Resorts also got slapped with a substantial AUD450 million ($309.8 million) fine by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) for significant lapses in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism measures at Crown Perth and Crown Melbourne.</p>
<p>This move towards heightened player protection aligns with broader industry reforms. Former premier Daniel Andrews previously announced stringent gambling and anti-money laundering measures in August, affecting all pubs and clubs.</p>
<p>Back in September, Crown Resorts introduced a Premium Player Program at its Crown Melbourne and Crown Sydney casinos, excluding Crown Perth, in a strategic move to rebuild its. The program, directly overseen by Crown Resorts, enforced strict eligibility criteria, collaborating with regulators to ensure compliance with post-inquiry regulations, reflecting the company’s commitment to responsible gaming and ethical practices under the leadership of CEO Ciaran Carruthers.</p>
