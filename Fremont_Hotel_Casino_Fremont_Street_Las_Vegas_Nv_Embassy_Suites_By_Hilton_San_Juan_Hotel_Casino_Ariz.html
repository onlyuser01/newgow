<p>Pariplay, a NeoGames subsidiary, has added a new studio and developer to its Fusion aggregation platform, Arcadia Gaming Solutions. Moving forward, Fusion partners will be able to access Arcadia iGaming titles and elevate their own customer experience by offering innovative games by the developer.</p>
<p>Arcadia Becomes Part of Fusion Platform Family</p>
<p>Arcadia has focused on developing online casino experiences that are predicated on physical arcade machines, leading to unique gameplay for players. Arcadia is hoping to carve out a brand-new niche in the live gaming experience whereby arcade favorites can be integrated with the live casino games experience and provide players with brand new opportunities in the vertical.</p>
<p>The company’s first title, Fortune Pusher is already part of the Fusion platform. More games are expected to be added soon, Pariplay said in a press release. Fortune Pusher is described as an “arcade coin pusher” which will now be available to players. Players get to control the coin that is shot into the machine and then watch as prize chips are pushed around so that a win is scored.</p>
<p>Arcadia films the machines in action using high-definition cameras which are available across a range of platforms, including desktop and mobile devices. Pariplay director of partnerships Callum Harris welcomed this new addition which is bound to elevate the experience for players owing to its unique product:</p>
<p>Arcadia is a true innovator when it comes to video-streaming live game machine technology, and we are thrilled to have them as a new Fusion partner as we always look for content that stands out and offers something unique to players.</p>
<p>Harris and Pariplay also have big expectations from Arcadia and the company’s subsequent releases. Arcadia Group CEO Avey Gabrielli hailed the opportunity and content partnership with Pariplay.</p>
<p>Elevating Live Casino Gameplay with Arcade Touch</p>
<p>Through this connection, Arcadia Group will have the opportunity to connect with players around the world. “We have great plans to expand our portfolio with even more games that offer a fantastic gaming experience, and with the help of a distribution partner like Pariplay, we know we will be able to quickly gain momentum in numerous regulated markets,” Gabrielli said.</p>
<p>Pariplay reunites games by more than 80 suppliers and currently features 13,000 games, including innovative novelties such as Arcadia’s products.</p>
