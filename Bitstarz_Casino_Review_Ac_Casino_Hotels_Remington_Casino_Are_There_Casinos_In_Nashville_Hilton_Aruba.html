<p>Do LA Lakers‚Äô Veterans Still Have It?</p>
<p>LeBron James is the oldest NBA player entering the 2023-24 season. ‚ÄúKing James,‚Äù a four-time MVP who‚Äôs won the NBA Championship four times will be 37 in two months. Despite his advancing age, he looks fit and ready to do at least as well as last season.</p>

<p>As a reminder, his field goal percentage last season was .500, which is his second-worst number since coming to LA. He also recorded fewer assists than usual ‚Äì 6.8 per game.</p>
<p>On the bright side, all of the other Lakers‚Äô key men are still in the best years for playing basketball ‚Äì Anthony Davis (30), D‚ÄôAngelo Russell (27), and others. The bad news for the Lakers fans is that the same applies to the Denver Nuggets as well.</p>
<p>Nuggets Looking for Their 8th Straight Home Win Over Lakers</p>
<p>The Denver Nuggets are famously good at Ball Arena in Denver, one of many bits of evidence being that they‚Äôve got all wins in the last seven Lakers vs. Nuggets games played in Colorado.</p>
<p>Actually, they have a very good record against this opponent regardless of the venue ‚Äì they won each of the five games they played against the Lakers so far in 2023.</p>

<p>The reigning NBA champions are eager to start their title defense, which is no surprise as their roster looks at least as good as last season. Nikola Jokic is their biggest star, but he‚Äôs not the only one. In addition to the 2024 NBA MVP favorite, this team also has Jamal Murray and many other elite players.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers vs. Denver Nuggets Prediction</p>
<p>The confidence is sky high in Denver‚Äôs locker room with the Nuggets players impatiently waiting for the start of their title-defending campaign. They have a tough opponent coming to Ball Arena on the 2023-24 season opening day, but we have no doubt that Jokic &amp; Co. will be able to handle it.</p>
