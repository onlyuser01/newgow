    <h1>Gila River Resorts Casinos Vee Quiva Hotel Monte Carlo Resort And Casino Grand Sierra Resort And Cas</h1>

<p>Good day. I opened an account in Bitcoin currency (I made all deposits from my Bitcoin wallet, I also made a conclusion to it) in a cryptowild casino, took a bonus on my first deposit (I lost it). I made the following deposits without a bonus. All bets lost at 0.8-3 dollars and I bet the last 10 dollars, and caught x180. Then he continued the game reaching a balance of 0.25 BTC. And set the output to 0.03 btc. And left the casino.</p>
<p>The next day, June 4, I read a letter that you need to fill in the data, send your passport and selfie with the date and name of the casino. I sent them 2 selfies and a passport, as they requested. And he continued the game after losing to 0.18 BTC</p>
<p>The next day, 05.06 I checked the mail, there were no letters from the casino. Tried to log into the account gives an error that the account is blocked. I wrote in a chat they told me that my account was blocked due to duplicate account. I did not create other accounts with them, and I made the gain from the last money in the account, playing without a bonus in bitcoins. They told me to wait while the head sends me a letter, with explanations and explanations of my ban.</p>
<p>06.06 I checked the mail, there are no letters from the casino. I turned to the chat again to find out how long to wait, they told me that they again made a request to the head. And so I can duplicate the request from email. I sent an email to the e-mail, but my mail gave an error that this mailbox is not available. I wrote about this error in the chat, they said thanks, we will solve the problem of inaccessibility of mail.</p>
<p>07.06 My mail is empty again, in a chat they told me that they sent another request to the head to answer for what reason and for what they banned me. They said to wait, that this is because of the weekend.</p>
<p>06/08 Mail is empty again, I unsubscribed in a chat, waiting 20 minutes for an answer. They said your account is now banned for fraud, although before they wrote that there were duplicate accounts. I asked about the letter from the head and why now is another reason. They closed and left the chat because of this the screenshots of the latter could not be made.</p>
<p>My summary:</p>
<p>He played in bitcoins, took only the bonus on the first deposit that he lost. Verification passed. I have no other accounts in this casino. Winnings made without active or other bonuses. I did not violate the rules of the casino.</p>
<p>The casino does not make contact, changes the reasons for the ban over time, does not want to provide evidence or anything to me and closes the chats.</p>
<p>I ask you to consider this complaint at the cryptowild.com casino or, if possible, suggest where else you can go (under license or how else). For me it looks as strange as possible that when you win, the casino can block any account without writing specific reasons. And just ignoring it. I really hope for your help</p>
