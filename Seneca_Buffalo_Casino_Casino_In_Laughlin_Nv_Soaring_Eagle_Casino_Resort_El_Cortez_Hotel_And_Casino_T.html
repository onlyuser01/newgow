<p>The leading supplier of sports betting technology and solutions, BETBY, announced it forged a new partnership, growing its Latin American footprint. The company unveiled Wednesday details regarding its latest partnership in the region, an agreement with Fun88, a market-leading Asian gaming brand. Under the terms of the new long-term partnership, BETBY agreed to power the brand with its innovative technology.</p>
<p>With the new deal, Fun88 anticipates offering exceptional sports betting experiences for its increasing number of customers in the region. Leveraging BETBY's cutting-edge technology, the brand anticipates growing in the region. Moreover, thanks to the company's AI-generated content module and feed, Fun88 plans to expand while offering unique games for its customers.</p>
<p>The partnership follows an extensive search by the leading Asian brand. Ultimately, Fun88 selected BETBY for its leading technology, advanced solutions and official data feeds. Using this technology, an important goal for the brand is to meet and exceed the expectations of its customers across Latin America.</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for Fun88 praised the new deal with BETBY. They explained: "We are excited about our partnership with BETBY and look forward to bringing our passion and expertise for sports and betting to the Latin-American market." Finally, the spokesperson noted: "The overall quality and flexibility of BETBY along with their dedicated team support makes us confident in this collaboration."</p>
<p>Chris Nikolopoulos, BETBY's CCO, was similarly delighted about the freshly minted long-term partnership with Fun88. "Fun88 has established itself as a leading brand in the Asian market," he explained. Finally, Nikolopoulos pointed out: "With an experienced leadership team, and an ambitious growth strategy, Fun88 has all the ingredients BETBY looks for in an operator."</p>
<p>Recently, Fun88 inked an important sports-focused collaboration. The brand clinched a deal with Newcastle United, strengthening its ties with the Premier League soccer club. As a result of the deal, Fun88 was designated as the team's official Asian betting partner.</p>
<p>On the other hand, last summer, BETBY expanded the reach of its solutions and portfolio of partners by teaming up with NuxGame, a leading iGaming provider. Per the deal, the provider gained access to BETBY's innovative technology. Per that partnership, NuxGame tapped into BETBY's Betby.Games portfolio, offering engaging and quality games.</p>
