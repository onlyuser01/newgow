    <h1>California Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Harrah S Casino North Carolina Taj Mahal Casino Atlantic City</h1>

<p>It’s time for the second week of the 2023 season of the Professional Fighters League (PFL). The event called PFL 2 is on the program on Friday, April 7, with the Women’s Featherweight fight between Larissa Pacheco and Julia Budd being the headliner bout</p>
<p>Larissa Pacheco (19-4) is the reigning PFL Women’s Featherweight who starts her title defense with a fight against the former Bellator champion, Julia Budd (16-5). Oddsmakers think Pacheco will win, but Budd is hungry for success after losing two fights in a row. Maybe it’s time for her to quench her hunger.</p>

<p>Larissa Pacheco Looking for her 7th Straight Win</p>
<p>Of all the fighters taking the stage in PFL Week 2, Larissa Pacheco is the biggest favorite, priced at -750. What this means is that those who back her would win $100 on a $750 bet. So, is it worth risking so much? Well, we do think she’s favored for a reason – Pacheco is the fighter who won last year’s PFL Women’s Featherweight tournament.</p>
<p>She did it by defeating legendary Kayla Harrison even though she was a +450 underdog before the fight. The fight lasted for full five rounds with Pacheco eventually winning by decision. She showed in that match that she’s a great wrestler/grappler who can deal with the Olympic gold medalist in judo.</p>
<p>Before demonstrating her fantastic wrestling/grappling skills, we saw her demolish a couple of fine strikers. She defeated Julija Pajic, Olena Kolesnyk (twice), Genah Fabian, and Zamzagul Fayzallanova, each by KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Julia Budd Hoping to End Her Losing Streak</p>
<p>Julia Budd is a former Bellator champ, who used to hold the Women’s Featherweight World Championship from 2017 to 2020. In 2021, she inked a deal with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), winning against Kaitlin Young by a decision on her promotional debut. However, she then went on to lose the following two fights – to Genah Fabian and Aspen Ladd.</p>
<p>It sounds bad, but there’s a caveat. She lost to Fabian by unanimous decision in a fight in which Fabian was 4.8 pounds over the limit. In the fight against Ladd, Budd lost by a split decision after a real battle in the cage that lasted for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Larissa Pacheco vs. Julia Budd Prediction</p>
<p>Larissa Pacheco is a -750 favorite for a reason – she’s very, very likely to win the fight on Friday. However, we don’t think it’s going to be too easy for her. Budd is a very tough fighter who lost only three fights by stoppage. The last time it happened was against Cris Cyborg in the Bellator title fight.</p>
<p>However, it’s been a while since she fought for 25 minutes the last time. Considering that she’s turning 40 in a few months, we suspect her cardio might not be good enough to stay in the ring for full five rounds.</p>
<p>That said, our PFL 2 prediction is that Pacheco is going to win by a finish, but very late in the bout. We should see at least three rounds on Friday.</p>
<p>Pick: Larissa Pacheco to win inside the distance; over 2.5 rounds</p>
