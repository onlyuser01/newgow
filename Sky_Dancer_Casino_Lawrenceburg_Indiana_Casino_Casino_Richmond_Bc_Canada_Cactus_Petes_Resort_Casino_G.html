<p>Logrand Entertainment-owned Mexican betting and entertainment company, Strendus, has inked a three-year contract with the Spanish professional football league LaLiga. The agreement will place Strendus in the position of the league’s official sponsor in Mexico.</p>
<p>Sharing the Passion for Sports</p>
<p>An announcement for the deal was published on LaLiga’s official website. Thanks to the deal, Strendus will have the opportunity to act in compliance with Spain’s recently introduced laws that prohibit operators from teaming up with football franchises.</p>
<p>Logrand Entertainment’s director of online operations, Lenin Castillo, spoke about the deal with LaLiga. He revealed that Strendus has always sought to know its customers and be close to them. Castillo mentioned that Strendus’ goal is to differentiate itself on the market by providing highly personalized offerings to its customers. The director of online operations added that he’s thankful to everyone who has supported the operator over the years.</p>
<p>Castillo added that the partnership with LaLiga is the culmination of Strendus’ long years of development and fan support. He finally promised that the alliance with the football league would bring many benefits to Strendus users.</p>
<p>The chief executive of LaLiga’s North American branch, Boris Gartner, also spoke about the crucial importance of having strong partners. He believes that the deal with Strendus will allow LaLiga to reach more fans of the sport.</p>
<p>“For many years, we have played with passion and shared it with viewers – we are proud to share it now with Strendus consumers as well,” Gartner said.</p>
<p>About The Two Parties</p>
