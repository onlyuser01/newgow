<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Green Bay Packers Week 15 game is on the program on Sunday, December 17, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay</p>
<p>Sunday’s Tampa Bay vs. Green Bay game is interesting for a number of reasons, the main being that these two teams are very similar in 2023.</p>
<p>They’re both playing with a new quarterback compared to the previous season, they’re both doing well defensively, and most importantly, they’re both at 6-7 right now. Both teams have a good chance of making the playoffs, which makes their duel in Week 15 extremely important.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers Looking for Their 3rd Straight Win</p>
<p>The Buccaneers are 6-7 overall with two of those wins happening in their previous two games. First, they defeated the Carolina Panthers 21-18 at home, which isn’t much of an achievement, but they then went on to beat the in-form Atlanta Falcons 29-25 on the road.</p>
<p>They’re doing alright defensively, which is no surprise. But they’re also scoring a lot, which may come as a bit of a surprise given that they no longer have Tom Brady on the roster. Instead, in the 2023 NFL, Baker Mayfield is their starting quarterback.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old who came to Tampa as a free agent has been playing very well so far. He’s thrown for a total of 2,934 yards so far, recording 20 TD passes and just eight interceptions, with his quarterback rating being 52.3. That’s his best QB rating since 2020.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers Relying on Lambeau Field Power</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers are 6-7 in the 2023 season, with four of those wins happening on their turf. Plus, they won each of their last three games at Lambeau Field, the last of which was a 27-19 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers’ replacement in the role of the QB, Jordan Love, had a fabulous evening, throwing for 267 yards and three touchdowns, with zero interceptions. And in the game before that, he did something similar – Love threw for 268 yards, three TDs, and no interceptions against the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him and his team, he didn’t do as great last Monday. The Giants beat the Packers 24-24 with Love throwing for one TD and one interception.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Green Bay Packers Prediction</p>
<p>Both teams are punching above their weight in the 2023 season, but it’s Green Bay that’s really been impressive. These guys have slain some real giants, which is why we think they’re going to be able to beat the Bucs as well.</p>
<p>In fact, we think they might even cover the spread, the main reason being that Sunday’s game is played at Lambeau.</p>
<p>Pick: Green Bay Packers -3 (-118)</p>
