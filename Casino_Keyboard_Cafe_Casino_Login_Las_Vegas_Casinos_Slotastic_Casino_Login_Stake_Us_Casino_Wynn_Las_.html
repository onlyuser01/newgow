<p>Wynn Las Vegas announced yesterday that the company is reopening its Strip Buffet on Thursday, June 18. The Buffet will be operating under an all-you-can-eat concept which Wynn deemed as “experience of your dreams.“</p>
<p>Visitors will be able to reorder as many dishes as they want for a period of two hours. Operating under strict health and safety protocols, the Buffet will implement social distancing. Furthermore, one-time menus will be offered as well as QR code menus. The venue will promote a resort to casual attire. However, visitors with tank tops or swimwear will not be permitted to enter the premises. Wynn’s Strip Buffet requires a reservation which can be done online.</p>
<p>Guests of the Buffet will have a pick from 90 different food choices. Among those is slow roasted prime rib, crab legs and sushi, but also a variety of tasty desserts.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Strip Restaurants, Casinos and Bars Slowly Reopen for Visitors</p>
<p>The gaming industry and other businesses deemed as non-essential were ordered to close down back in March. The order by Governor Steve Sisolak was aiming to flatten the curve of coronavirus (COVID-19) spread in the state. Now, three months later, businesses located on the Las Vegas Strip are preparing for visitors.</p>
<p>The reopening of businesses is in line with strict social distancing and health and safety protocols introduced by state officials. Many of the businesses which announced reopening assured that they will do what is necessary to protect both their employees and guests.</p>
<p>Besides Wynn Las Vegas, another major player announced reopening plans. Caesars Entertainment has announced plans to reopen Paris Las Vegas on the same day as Wynn Las Vegas – June 18.</p>
