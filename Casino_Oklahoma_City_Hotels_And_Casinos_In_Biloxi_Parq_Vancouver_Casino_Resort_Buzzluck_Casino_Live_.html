<p>The victim was identified as David Danzinger. Police said he had blood on his face and a plastic bag stuffed in his mouth. Nearby was a tent pole covered with blood. Witnesses identified the assailant as “Sosa,” who, they said, is “well-known for his violent behavior,” according to Las Vegas TV station KLAS.</p>
<p>Sosa, formally known as Cecil Walls, 41, apparently followed Danzinger on the bridge. He then allegedly grabbed the victim as they got into a fight. Danzinger lost consciousness from his injuries and later passed away. An autopsy revealed he suffered cuts and bruises on his head, abrasions on his neck, and bruises on his left tricep, according to KLAS.</p>
<p>Walls later was discovered on 9th Street while pushing a shopping cart. The suspect also pushed a shopping cart on the bridge.</p>
<p>Walls denied involvement in the other man’s death.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t there yesterday. These aren’t the clothes I was wearing yesterday,” Walls told Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officers, according to Las Vegas TV station KVVU.</p>
<p>Walls was apprehended and booked at Clark County Detention Center on Monday. No bail was set. He remained in custody on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It has been determined that Cecil Walls had been using his dad’s date of birth. Walls is 41 years old, and his full name is Cecil Walls Jr. Walls' booking photo accompanies this release. https://t.co/HPGezom58f pic.twitter.com/kt8fY0KbwP — LVMPD (@LVMPD) July 18, 2023</p>

<p>Seven other dogs were found alive there, as well. It appears that people were moving the dogs from two vehicles. The case was turned over to the LVMPD’s Animal Cruelty Unit.</p>
<p>Katrina Brazil, 47, was charged with two counts of willful and malicious torture, maiming, and killing of a dog, according to KLAS.</p>
<p>Man Accused of Impersonating Federal Agent</p>
<p>A man who allegedly impersonated a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent in Las Vegas has agreed to a plea deal.</p>
<p>The suspect, Zachary Sanns of New Jersey, pretended to be a federal agent during a May 30, 2020, rally connected to the death of George Floyd, according to Las Vegas TV station KTNV.</p>
<p>Sanns wore a vest at the rally with a DHS patch on the front, which said “Federal Agent” on the back. He also had a ballistic helmet and night-vision goggles, a gun belt with a pistol and an extended magazine, and an AR-15-style rifle with an optic magnifier, according to KTNV.</p>
<p>Sanns allegedly told federal authorities he worked for the DHS.</p>
<p>Given their impression that he was a federal agent, Sanns participated in law enforcement during the protest. He assisted real officers and walked behind secure lines, authorities said.</p>
<p>He was charged with impersonation of a federal agent. He could face up to three years in jail, a year of supervised release, and a $250K fine.</p>
<p>The rally was held near Fremont Street and 7th Street in Las Vegas.</p>
