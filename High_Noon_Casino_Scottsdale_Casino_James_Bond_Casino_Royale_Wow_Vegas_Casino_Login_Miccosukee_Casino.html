<p>Crown’s Property in Sydney Opens Doors without Its Casino</p>
<p>Crown Resorts’ newest venue located in Sydney, Australia opened its doors for visitors today. Although the luxury resorts’ main attraction was planned to be the VIP casino, visitors would have to wait for that amenity as for the moment it remains closed. The luxury resort, located in Sydney’s central area Barangaroo, took four years to construct. Claimed as the “most luxurious” hotel in Australia, the project had a price tag of AU$2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Crown Sydney’s luxurious complex features the Crown Towers “six star” hotel, multiple restaurants, high-class retails as well as bars. With that in mind, the high roller casino remains closed because the NSW regulator withheld the approval for the casino last month. This decision was the result of an inquiry that was aiming to determine if Crown Resorts was still suitable to hold a second casino license in Sydney.</p>
<p>During the inquiry, allegations against Crown of money laundering and ties to organized crime surfaced. Furthermore, at the end of the hearings, more claims against Crown surfaced alleging that vital details were concealed during the inquiry by the gaming giant. Consequently, the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) revealed that the new venue’s gaming license will be considered next year in February.</p>
<p>Guests Can Enjoy Multiple Available Amenities</p>
<p>The newly opened Crown Towers hotel with its 275 meters height is in fact the tallest hotel in Sydney. The luxury hotel offers 349 guest hotel rooms. Furthermore, there are more than 10 restaurants and bars as well as a spa and a pool. Guests of the luxury venue can also enjoy wonderful views from an observation deck, located 250 meters above the ground.</p>
<p>“We are excited to open the doors and let Sydney experience it.” Peter Crinis, Chief Executive Officer at Crown Sydney</p>
<p>In a statement, Peter Crinis, Crown Sydney’s Chief Executive Officer, revealed said that Sydney is one of the world’s greatest cities and it deserves a great hotel. Undoubtedly Crown Towers will deliver great experiences, added Crinis.</p>
<p>According to him, the amazing bars and restaurants will make the hotel an “incredible destination for Sydney“. In conclusion, he revealed that Crown Sydney is excited to open its doors and let Sydney’s guests experience it.</p>
