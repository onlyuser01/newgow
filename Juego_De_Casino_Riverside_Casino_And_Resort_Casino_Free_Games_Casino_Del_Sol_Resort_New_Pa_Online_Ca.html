<p>Action 24/7 President Tina Hodges recently talked about sports betting in Tennessee and the launch of her company’s new online sports betting app.</p>
<p>Action 24/7’s New App</p>
<p>Tennessee-based sportsbook operator Action 24/7 has recently launched a digital sportsbook app for Android and iPhone. The app allows users to quickly and comfortably bet on a variety of sports matches.</p>
<p>In November, the State of Tennessee decided to legalize online sports betting. There are already several international companies active on the fledgling market, but Action 24/7 is the only locally-operated service in the State.</p>
<p>Action 24/7 President Tina Hodges recently appeared on the Tennessee Star Report to discuss the current state of affairs in the fledgling sports betting market as well as the launch of Action 24/7’s new sportsbook app.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Market in Tennessee</p>
<p>After a brief introduction from the host, Ms. Hodges says that the betting app has so far enjoyed positive feedback and substantial interest from consumers. She also notes that a sizable amount of people are not aware of the recent legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>The online sports betting market is already inundated with big players. Ms. Hodges says that competing with companies of this size is tough. Action 24/7 does not have the budget to run a massive marketing campaign, especially given the recent spike in advertising costs. However, Ms. Hodges stresses that Action 24/7 has found great success and public interest despite this limitation.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodges also touches on the topic of the COVID-19 pandemic. She says that while the spread of the virus has had a substantial impact across most industries, she believes that sports have been affected in a particularly interesting way. Ms. Hodges explains that there is no certainty which players will be participating in games since any of them can be kept off the field due to health concerns. She notes that this has introduced some fluctuation, with both upsides and downsides.</p>
<p>App Design Philosophy</p>
<p>After a short commercial break, Ms. Hodges explains to listeners how to place bets through Action 24/7. Players can access the betting platform either through Action 24/7’s web page or by downloading the app, which is available for both Android and iPhone. She explains that wagers can be placed either through a digital transfer or by cash. Players who prefer the latter option can deposit cash at one of Action 24/7s many local retail partners.</p>
<p>Given that sports betting was legalized only recently, Action 24/7’s app is designed to comfortably introduce the betting process to players who may be new to it. The app also aims to alleviate some of the pressure on betters as it allows for bets to be placed earlier and faster.</p>
<p>One of the app’s strongest and most well-received features is its immediate pay-out. Ms. Hodges says that this is what separates Action 24/7 from much of the industry. She notes that to her knowledge, Action 24/7 is the only company that provides immediate and legitimate pay-out options.</p>
<p>Players can use the app to place bets on a wide variety of sports, including football, soccer, basketball, baseball, and even rodeo. Betting on animal sports, such as dog and horse races, is not allowed.</p>
