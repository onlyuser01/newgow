    <h1>Horseshoe Casino Bossier Horseshoe Casino In Baltimore Boombet Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Punta C</h1>

<p>As efforts to maintain a safe betting ecosystem in America continue, two more operators have vowed to assist the American Gaming Association (AGA) with its responsible gambling endeavors.</p>
<p>Two More Operators Vowed to Promote Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>The ones who volunteered to help the Association are Parx Casino’s parent company, Greenwood Racing, and the Providence-headquartered gambling and entertainment firm Bally’s Corporation. The two will offer their support to the Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly Initiative – a campaign that promotes safer, responsible, and moderate gambling.</p>
<p>Have A Game Plan was launched in 2019 and aims to teach US bettors how to play responsibly and make informed decisions. With more and more US jurisdictions legalizing sports betting, the AGA is aware that sending out a message about safe gambling is crucial to preventing gambling harm.</p>
<p>Numerous organizations, such as gambling operators, suppliers, sports leagues, teams, players, etc have demonstrated their support of AGA’s initiative. As partners of Have A Game Plan, Greenwood and Bally’s join a strong lineup of allies, including Barstool Sportsbook, BetMGM, DraftKings, Delaware North, Entain, FanDuel, Global Payments, MGM Resorts International, MSG Network, Monumental Sports and Entertainment, NASCAR, New York Knicks, New York Jets, New York Rangers, the NHL, Nuvei, Penn National Gaming, the PGA TOUR, Rush Street Interactive, SeventySix Capital, Sightline Payments, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, USFL, Vegas Golden Knights and Washington Commanders.</p>
<p>Greenwood and Bally’s Are Glad to Join the Initiative</p>
<p>Greenwood and Bally’s will join the efforts to teach the public how to bet responsibly by launching various education materials on their digital platforms and social media outlets.</p>
<p>Marc Oppenheimer, chief marketing officer of Parx, spoke about the importance of supporting responsible gaming. He emphasized how important safe betting is to Greenwood Racing’s sports betting strategy and said that his team is excited to extend its commitment to consumer education. Oppenheimer is delighted to join AGA and contribute to the evolution of gambling in North America.</p>
<p>Robeson Reeves, president of interactive for Bally’s Corporation and chairman of the ESG committee, said that his company is just as devoted to safe gambling. As one of the leaders in the global gaming industry, Reeves realizes the need to support healthy betting. He is delighted by the opportunity to team up with the AGA and demonstrate Bally’s commitment to responsible gambling. With responsible gambling being one of the key topics in the industry, numerous operators have vowed to support AGA’s initiative. In January Penn National Gaming became one of the many allies of Have A Game Plan. Two weeks ago, Delaware North also joined the campaign.</p>
