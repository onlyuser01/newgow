<p>Pink Casino, a LeoVegas Group brand, is debuting in Canada which adds to the group’s efforts in securing a more permanent position on the North American market.</p>
<p>Pink Casino Makes Its Mark on Canada</p>
<p>LeoVegas continues with the expansion of its Pink Casino brand across Canada bringing local players a world-class gaming and entertainment experience, the company announced in a press release on Monday. This is the first time Pink Casino has ventured in North America and launched beyond its home bastion in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, LeoVegas already operates under several trade names in Canada, with Pink Casino adding to a growing ecosystem of top-tier gaming choices. Pink Casino will similarly benefit from LeoVegas’ knowledge and local expertise, allowing the latest brand to adapt itself to specific market tastes and preferences.</p>
<p>The further expansion of LeoVegas’ brand portfolio has been made possible with the help of the company’s proprietary technical platform which arrived earlier in 2020. LeoVegas is optimizing the use of its current resources in a bid to spur global growth and expand its outreach.</p>
<p>Pin Casino has a specific focus on female demographics and is a content platform similar to 888ladies’, only it has achieved much better integration with the target audiences and has conducted a better outreach.</p>

<p>“This is a superb way to use our strong brands and deliver profitable growth. I look forward to offering the Canadian market even more gaming fun and entertainment in the form of Pink Casino.”</p>
<p>Canada is part of LeoVegas’ ambitious growth portfolio that features a ‘Rest of the World’ growth vertical of in the country plays important role. The region as a whole accounts for 18% of the group’s total revenue in the third quarter of 2020, making for a pivotal segment for the company.</p>
