    <h1>Slots Casino Near Me Juwa Casino Login Hotels Near Southland Casino Resorts Hotel Casino New Usa Onl</h1>

<p>Hi I need to warn people about a horrific experience I had with this casino group!</p>
<p>After requesting a withdrawal and verifying my account I got an email saying it would be processed instantly and in certain situations up to 24 hours .</p>
<p>I now see that my withdrawal for 702â‚¬ has been rejected I wrote to support and they replied that I I have mistyped my payment information on the withdrawal page?</p>
<p>Now I am getting worried! Because I screen recorded my session I went back into my photo library and checked my video quickly finding out that what the casino told me was blatantly wrong I copied my details from my bank app leaving no mistake for errror.</p>
<p>Next morning I wrote support again and now I am told that the other agent was a newly hired agent that made a mistake by telling me that I mistyped my payment information</p>
<p>Then he tells me that wisho casino currently have issues with users withdrawing back to their cards?</p>
<p>Okay now whatâ€™s next excuse now??</p>
<p>(Update) now they Said they identified the problem and that I should make a deposit to with skrill and withdraw with skrill.</p>
<p>Ideposited 20 euro with skrill and quickly verified my skrill account</p>
<p>Now they say new problems have caused problems with my skrill withdrawal?? ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS!!!â€™</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I WAS ACCUSED OF TYPING PAYMENT INFORMATION WRONG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOW SUDDENLY ITS A PROBLEM WITH CREDIT CARD WITHDRAWAL FOR MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOW THEY TELL ME TO DEPOSIT WITH SKRILL ONLY TO LOCK UP MORE OF MY MONEY .. (720â‚¬)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I signed up this site after reading the supposedly high rating on casino-guru and ask gamblers</p>
<p>If you look at playerâ€™s reviews at ask gamblers the comments and ratings look very trustworthy (not sarcastic)</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know what to believe anymore</p>
<p>but I have been told that I should wait 12 days before submitting my documentation</p>
<p>I have been treated unfairly and have video of every bet transaction and dialogue..</p>
<p>I would never accuse them of scamming because maybe they are right?? Maybe there is some technical difficulties delaying my withdrawal.. but this is a maybe bit to shady for my liking.</p>
<p>Will update soon if they somehow figure out to pay my winnings.. but I might never see my money again</p>
<p>The thing is they have reverted my withdrawal 6-7 times itâ€™s almost feel like they want you to spin your balance but then again what do I know??</p>
<p>They wonâ€™t give me my money but at least they are sorry and of course "here you go my friend here is 100 free spins with 0.10 bet size for the inconvenienceâ€¦ and we hope you have a sunny day</p>
<p>A SUNNY DAY???? A SUNNY DAY????</p>
<p>If they do comment this posts they might accuse me of breaking some terms or gaslight me for telling about my experience</p>
<p>But in the end at least i stood up to myself</p>
<p>And fought my case</p>
<p>When the first support member accused of something false I knew this would be a long fight ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«</p>
<p>I just wish people could be trustworthy and treat each other with care but unfortunately those time a long gone ..</p>
<p>I will never play here again even if I get my funds and I think they know that too</p>
<p>Why would they give an annoying customer that keep contacting support for information about the whereabouts of their money ?</p>
<p>Well..they have the power to not give me my money without any consequences so why would they??? I just hope there is some beautiful angelic person in the financial department that decides to process my withdrawal..</p>
