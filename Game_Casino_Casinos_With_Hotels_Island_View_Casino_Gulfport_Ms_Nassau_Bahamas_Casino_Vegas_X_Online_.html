<p>The provider of leading player development, marketing and gaming platforms that provide real-time operational tools for the hospitality and gaming sector, Quick Custom Intelligence (QCI), announced that it expanded the reach of its QCI Enterprise platform version 5.2 The company revealed last week that its 5.2 version of the QCI Enterprise Platform has successfully deployed for three of The Cordish Companies' Live! Casinos, located in Maryland, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The new version of the platform builds further upon the rich legacy of the award-winning QCI Platform. It provides unique options for automation and plays an important part in the daily management of retail gaming operations. Moreover, QCI's improved platform stands out with boosted efficiencies and leverages accurate data models.</p>
<p>Dr. Ralph Thomas, QCI's CEO, shared his excitement about the recent announcement in a statement. "Live! Casino's adoption of the QCI Enterprise Platform is proof of the importance of having a dynamic host management tool to effectively manage a dynamic gaming organization such as Live! Casinos," he said. Finally, Thomas confirmed: "We collaborate daily with the 1,800 player development professionals using our host tool to constantly add features and functionality for ease of use."</p>
<p>Tom Tuchschmidt, Live! Casinos' Vice President of Casino Relationship Marketing, shared Thomas' excitement and acknowledged the benefits of QCI's leading solutions. "Since we started using QCI earlier this year, I have found it to be a standout when it comes to Casino CRM programs," he said. According to Tuchschmidt, QCI's technology delivers powerful tools for hotel profitability and centralized metrics for player worth, among other unique capabilities.</p>
<p>The Vice President of Casino Relationship Marketing at Live! Casinos explained: "My casino host engagement has been strong because they find QCI easy to navigate and helpful in executing their contact strategy with their VIP players." Finally, Tuchschmidt pointed out: "I find the dashboards incredibly helpful when delivering player analytics and host performance reports to our senior leadership."</p>
<p>The latest collaboration comes after only recently, Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming unveiled they elevated the experiences for their guests by introducing QCI's Enterprise Platform. The collaboration, announced back in March, saw the companies benefit from QCI's leading technology.</p>
<p>At the same time, QCI was able to expand further the reach of its innovative technology. In that line of thought, the latest collaboration with Live! Casinos further complements this goal and allows the leading provider of solutions for the gaming sector to continue expanding its reach.</p>
