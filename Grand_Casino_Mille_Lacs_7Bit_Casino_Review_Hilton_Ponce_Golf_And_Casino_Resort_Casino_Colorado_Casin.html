    <h1>Grand Casino Mille Lacs 7Bit Casino Review Hilton Ponce Golf And Casino Resort Casino Colorado Casin</h1>

<p>I want to make an inquiry and not a complaint, and I decided to turn to the complaints department on this issue.</p>
<p>I don't play in the casino at https://www.efbet.com/ but I still sent a color copy of my ID in the summer of 2020. and my account has been verified. On 31.10.20 I make a deposit with a card to which I send a color copy for verification. On 07.12.20 I make a deposit with another card to which I send a color copy for verification. On the same date I won the amount of BGN 220. and release the money to withdraw. But they refuse to draw me and want me to verify a card I don't even remember. I made a reference and it turned out that for the last 10 years. I have 1 more successful deposit made with a card on 13.05.2016. which I have obviously not verified. I renew all cards every 2 years and I have no information about this card.</p>
<p>Is it right for them to approve my cards and for my account to be verified, but to inform me when withdrawing that I have not verified the account?</p>
<p>Other online casinos where I play send me a message if I have used a new deposit method or the account has not been verified. I receive messages and reminders that I will not be able to receive payment if I do not take certain measures.</p>
<p>I do not claim any amount because after I found out that I would not receive payment, the money was played. I also sent an email asking what the verification options are but I don't get a response.</p>
<p>Can you tell me if there is an option in which the account can be verified? Or since I don't have any information about this card, should I consider my account blocked, locked or unusable?</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>
<p>With respect</p>
<p>Николай</p>
