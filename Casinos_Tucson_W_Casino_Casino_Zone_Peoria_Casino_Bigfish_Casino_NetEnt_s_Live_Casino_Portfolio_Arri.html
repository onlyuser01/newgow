    <h1>Casinos Tucson W Casino Casino Zone Peoria Casino Bigfish Casino NetEnt s Live Casino Portfolio Arri</h1>

<p>NetEnt has rolled out its portfolio of live games on Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino consolidating its footprint in the live segment in Sweden.</p>
<p>Sweden’s Svenska Spel Adds NetEnt Live Products</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has completed the technical integration of NetEnt’s portfolio of live casino games for its Sports &amp; Casino platform. As per the agreement, NetEnt’s flagship live products have been integrated and rolled out on Svenska Spel’s digital skin.</p>
<p>The games include Blitz Blackjack, Auto Roulette Studio and a number of Perfect Blackjack titles. With this partnership, NetEnt is expanding its footprint in its native Swedish market, with Svenska Spel as one of the largest gaming firms in the country.</p>
<p>NetEnt is also bringing an A-level of marketing tools to allow Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino to take advantage from tailored campaigns designed to boost player acquisition and retention.</p>
<p>By signing this partnership with NetEnt, Svenska Spel expects to see a growth in the live dealer segment. Here is what Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino VP for Casino Jonas Nygren said:</p>
<p>“We are proud that all the hard work we have put into our offering is showing in the products. Launching with Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino is a major step in the growth of our live casino business and I’m sure that their players will enjoy our games.” Svenska Spel Sport &amp; Casino VP for Casino Jonas Nygren</p>
<p>Nygren was joined by his colleague over from NetEnt, Director of Live Products, Andreas Rengifo who argued that the launch with Svenska Spel was a major step towards the expansion of the live casino business.</p>
<p>Rengifo expressed confidence that Svenska’s players will find the products a worthwhile and engaging addition to the portfolio.</p>
<p>NetEnt Continues to Grow Its Portfolio at a Good Pace</p>
<p>NetEnt’s live product growth has been consistent over the past few years. The live casino portfolio has undergone several major changes, adding visual as well as gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Games such as Perfect Blackjack and Auto Roulette Studio have been some of the newest additions to the portfolio. NetEnt has been building up on its player experience, improving the user interface, usability and graphics.</p>
<p>It has mostly paid off. NetEnt’s products have enjoyed a great rate of adoption not only in Sweden but also in the United States.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Scientific Games and NetEnt struck a new partnership. As per the partnership, SG Digital’s OpenGaming platform will now feature NetEnt slot games.</p>
<p>Before that, NetEnt struck another deal with Wind Creek Casino in Pennsylvania. The company signed a similar partnership with BetMGM in West Virginia. Earlier this year, Tipico signed a partnership with NetEnt ahead of a planned New Jersey launch.</p>
