    <h1>Colusa Casino Resort Horseshoe Casino Shreveport La Hinkley Grand Casino Jokers Wild Casino Online C</h1>

<p>I have made a withdrawal of R2000 and it was canceled, they said they require me to submit the itemized bill which I didn't even know what it was at first,</p>
<p>then I asked the customer support on how can I acquire that and they told me that i can get it by contacting my network provider and then I did that and then submitted it</p>
<p>and then after some time I contacted the customer support to notify them that I have submitted the itemized bill and the person who was assisting me by that time told that they received the itemized bill and he/she has forwarded the itemized bill to the payments team</p>
<p>and told me that i should wait until they receive a response from the payment team so that i could receive my winnings.</p>
<p>It was on the 03.01.2024</p>
<p>Then I waited a day.</p>
<p>On the 04.01.2024 I contacted the customer support requesting an update with the withdrawal because the games weren't opening also</p>
<p>And then they told me that they haven't received any updates from the payment team yet, and told me the very same thing as yesterday, as if they're copying the same message from yesterday.</p>
<p>Then I waited another day and then today on the 05.01.2024 I reached out to the customer support again and asked information about my query and then the same copied answers again as if I'm talking to a machine,</p>
<p>Then after 30 minutes or an hour I received an email saying that my account has been closed.</p>
<p>Then after 5 to 10 minutes again I received an email from the customer support saying as follows :</p>
<p>Dear Koketso,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience!</p>

<p>So what i do not understand is why my account was closed and also what does they mean when saying my balance is voided?</p>
<p>Was the account closed because I kept on requesting an update every day?</p>
<p>Also I will lose the money that I won?</p>
<p>This is really not fair at all.</p>
<p>I just hope that you will resolve this issue, as I was referred by someone online about this website saying that you might be able to help me.</p>
<p>Thanks regards.</p>
