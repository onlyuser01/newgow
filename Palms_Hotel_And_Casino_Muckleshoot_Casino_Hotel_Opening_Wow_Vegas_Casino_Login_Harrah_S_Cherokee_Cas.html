<p>The first 2023 Thanksgiving Game is the Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions, which is taking place at Ford Field on Thursday, November 23</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers won against the Los Angeles Chargers last weekend with 23-20 on the scoreboard. They won thanks to a brilliant drive in the final portion of the game. The comeback of the Detroit Lions was even more impressive.</p>
<p>They were 13 points behind the Chicago Bears with under four minutes left on the clock, but then went on to score 17 points and win the game 31-26. As a result, they’ve come very close to the Philadelphia Eagles who are in the No. 1 spot in the National Football Conference standings.</p>

<p>Can Packers Upset the Odds Again?</p>
<p>The Packers entered last weekend’s game as three-point favorites, but they ended up winning the game by a field goal. They played on their turf, which helped them a lot to pull off a comeback. Still, the main reason why they won is that their opponents just weren’t great.</p>
<p>Green Bay’s quarterback Jordan Love did alright in that game, recording 322 receiving yards and two touchdowns. That, however, isn’t too much of a success given that the Chargers are horrible when it comes to passing defense – they’re allowing 291.6 yards per game, which is more than any other team in the league.</p>
<p>Green Bay’s next opponent, however, is conceding just 223.5 yards on average. Does this mean the Packers are in trouble in the 2023 Thanksgiving game?</p>
<p>Detroit Lions Eying the No.1 Seed in the NFC</p>
<p>The Eagles are currently top of the NFC standings with an 8-1 record. The Lions are just behind with an 8-2 record, but with an easier schedule than Philly. In fact, the only team with an above .500 record (at the moment) they’re going to play in the remainder of the season is the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>What this means is that they just need to make sure they don’t get complacent. There were some signs in the previous game that they’re heading there.</p>
<p>Their quarterback Jared Goff had a very strange game, throwing for two touchdowns, but also for three interceptions – his highest number of interceptions in 2023.</p>
<p>That man Amon-Ra St. Brown deserves more respect cause he’s one of the best WR’s in the league</p>

<p>Those two TDs Goff threw for happened thanks to Detroit’s wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs.</p>
<p>The Lions were brilliant running the ball in that game. They recorded 115 rushing yards against the Bears, with David Montgomery making 12 carries and demolishing the opposition defensive line to score one touchdown. Another rushing TD was the work of Jahmyr Gibbs.</p>
<p>Green Bay Packers vs. Detroit Lions Prediction</p>
<p>Who’s gonna win the first Thanksgiving game of 2023, the Green Bay Packers or Detroit Lions? Our prediction is the Lions. These guys have just been much better than the Packers. Their QB needs to straighten himself up, which is why we expect Detroit not only to win but to blow Green Bay out.</p>
<p>Picks: Detroit Lions to win and cover the spread.</p>
