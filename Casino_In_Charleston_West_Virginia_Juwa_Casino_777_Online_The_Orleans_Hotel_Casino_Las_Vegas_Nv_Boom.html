<p>Orlando City vs. Inter Miami a.k.a. The Florida Derby is on the program on Sunday, September 24 at Exploria Stadium in Orlando</p>
<p>When the betting markets opened, Orlando City vs. Inter Miami odds were in favor of the Herons at some online sportsbooks. Things have changed since. Orlando Cityâ€™s MLS odds went from +160 to -110 after it became apparent that Lionel Messi will not play on September 24.</p>
<p>The soccer GOAT will have to take a break from playing soccer for at least a couple of days due to a muscle injury thatâ€™s been bothering him for a while now. Thatâ€™s why he had to leave the field in the Toronto FC game last week after playing just 37 minutes. Despite not having the best player in history on the field, the Herons were still able to score four goals that evening. Can they do the same again?</p>
<p>Orlando City vs. Inter Miami Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Orlando City -115 Draw +295 Inter Miami +280</p>
<p>Goals Total Odds Over 3 +100 Under 3 -120</p>

<p>Orlando City Would Love to Get One Over Its Rival</p>
<p>Orlando City might not be the team with the best roster in the MLs, but these guys have been doing great in 2023. Theyâ€™re currently second in the Eastern Conference, with just a few points away from securing a spot in the 2023 MLS Playoffs.</p>
<p>Although there are no major stars in Orlando Cityâ€™s locker room, these guys have been playing great as a collective. Theyâ€™re equally good offensively and defensively, which their score difference proves. So far this season, theyâ€™ve scored 45 goals while conceding 36.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s interesting about Orlando Cityâ€™s performances in 2023 is that this team always shows up in big matches. For instance, each of Orlandoâ€™s three wins happened against teams that are doing great this season â€“ St. Louis City, Columbus Crew, and FC Cincinnati. Each of these was in the top three in their conference when they played against Orlando City.</p>
<p>Can Inter Miami Do Without Messi (Again)?</p>
<p>As confirmed by coach Gerardo Martino, Lionel Messi will not play against Orlando City due to an injury. The same was the reason why he left the pitch in the 37th minute of the game with Toronto FC when it was still 0-0 on the scoreboard.</p>

<p>Finnish winger Robert Taylor was the one who replaced him, which proved to be a great decision by coach Martino. Why? Because Taylor went on to score two goals and make one assist. Thanks to his output, Inter Miami was able to win 4-0 and get closer to the playoff zone. The Herons are now just five points behind the closest team from the top 9 (DC United) with two games in hand.</p>
<p>This wasnâ€™t the first time Inter Miami won without Messi. The Herons did the same against Sporting Kansas City when Messi was away in Argentina on international duty.</p>
<p>Orlando City vs. Inter Miami Prediction</p>
<p>Inter Miamiâ€™s best player is Lionel Messi, but this team is not a one-man army. The Herons have already proved a couple of times that they can do without him. Martinoâ€™s boys are motivated to win and we think theyâ€™re going to pull it off.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
