    <h1>Hinckley Grand Casino Pit Boss Casino Seminole Casino Nolimits Casino Fantasy Springs Resort Casino</h1>

<p>Hi Veronica,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn't know that when you play at an online casino you have to wait 14 days to collect your money, 888 casino contractual terms and conditions write about 3 business days to pay your winnings. Furthermore, I am used to the land-based casino that pays immediately or other online casinos that pay in 24 hours, I have played a few times on Leovegas and Unibet, they pay in 24 hours. I was alarmed because I read online on GURU that 888 casino has more than 100 complaints against its organization and GURU always reports on the 888casino.com profile card the numerous complaints because it does not pay the players. Furthermore, I found online sentences from courts and gambling authorities in the UK and Austria which report this casino as unsafe and have inflicted heavy fines of millions of euros for its illicit behaviour, furthermore the same authorities wanted (as we read) to revoke it the license to offer online gambling services online. https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gbp9-4m-fine-for-online-operator-888 - https://www.businessinsider.com/888-casino-record-fine-problem- gamblers-ukgc-gambling-commission-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T</p>
<p>I sure hope it's as you say they have delays in payments for internal reasons. Clearly I immediately set the monthly account top-up limit to 100 euros because last time I got carried away by loading more than 1000 euros on 888casino.com and now I find myself with liquidity problems. I was very happy when I won and I would certainly have continued to use the services of 888 but then they turned a good experience into a bad affair, they proved to be not very serious in their payments and for this reason I entered the limit of 100 euros per month, I cannot risking money with online casinos that pay so late because I have a family budget to manage, I even explained it to him via email. I wouldn't want them to have seen the 100 euro limit inserted and not want to pay the winnings obtained and try in every way to make me play the $6300 in the hope that I will lose it to their advantage. I clearly will not play on this casino anymore until they pay, hoping that they behave honestly so as to avoid complaints to the different authorities in the EU and Luxembourg. To conclude I would like to correct my mistake, the withdrawal is $6300 and NO EUROS. If you would like other documents and/or screenshots, I am ready to provide them immediately upon request. Thank you for your cooperation and we hope that 888casino.com behaves honestly by respecting the constraints of the MGA license and other active licenses, it would be a shame to report them for what is happening. Best regards</p>
