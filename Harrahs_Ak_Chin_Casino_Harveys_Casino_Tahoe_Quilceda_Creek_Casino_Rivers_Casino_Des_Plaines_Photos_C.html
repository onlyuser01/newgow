<p>Last Friday, Doug Ford, the Ontario Premier, announced that the customer capacity limits would be lifted on numerous businesses, casinos included, and the two gambling facilities in Niagara Falls saluted this decision by stating that it is a step “in the right direction.”</p>
<p>The president of Niagara Casinos, Richard Taylor, also praised the decision by saying that it is a great one for the casinos.</p>
<p>Niagara Falls is Reviewing the New Requirements</p>
<p>While speaking about Ford’s decision, Taylor added that being able to work at full capacity is a good step and so are the loosened requirements concerning maintaining a physical distance. He stated that the company is currently checking the new guidelines and is delighted to welcome back a higher number of guests and associates.</p>
<p>Taylor also noted that the biggest priority at Niagara Casinos will remain the safety of guests and the staff will remain committed to providing the best possible service.</p>
<p>While speaking about the new guidelines on Friday, Ford stated that the plan on lifting all COVID-19 restrictions by the end of March is in the works and may see the light of the day if all goes well. That includes not mandating masks or vaccine passports.</p>
<p>This would be massive development for the gambling industry in the region, as it will be able to expand and grow rapidly. Recently, the sports betting industry was slightly revolutionized with the introduction of new guidelines, which can prove to be good for the industry if the restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>The Changes Effective as of Today</p>
<p>The loosened restrictions concerning customer capacity are effective today, Monday, October 25. Apart from casinos, other companies/businesses that will be able to work with full capacity are bingo halls, bars, gyms, indoor event spaces and restaurants.</p>
<p>Ford’s announcement on the new guidelines concerning the pandemic came just a few hours after Niagara Falls announced that the Avalon Theater at Fallsview Casino Resort, which has 1,500 seats, will start hosting live entertainment. During the peak of the pandemic, the theater was forced to close its doors and curtains. After staying in the dark for approximately two years, entertainment will be reintroduced with Fallsview’s Christmas Wonderland, a Christmas-themed production.</p>
<p>This festive spectacle will include world-class dancers and singers and will be held from December 1 to December 18, during which Avalon will be turned into a winter wonderland.</p>
<p>Although there aren’t any guarantees that Ontario is coming closer to fully overcoming the pandemic, the recent period has proven to be effective in terms of handling the problems, which is why authorities are looking to ease up the measures. However, it all falls down on what types of challenges come in the next few months.</p>
