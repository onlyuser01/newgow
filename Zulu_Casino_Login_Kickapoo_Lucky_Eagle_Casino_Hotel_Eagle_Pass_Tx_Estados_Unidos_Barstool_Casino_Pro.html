<p>The Game Offers Exciting Gameplay and Great Prizes</p>
<p>Yggdrasil‚Äôs Easter Island 2 features a relaxing beach vacation theme. The game places the familiar statue duo and their bird friend at a beach, where they are surrounded by sand, parasols, and palm trees. Although the theme of the game is relaxing, Easter Island 2 provides the players with exciting gameplay options and great prizes.</p>
<p>Winning a spin awards the player with a Symbol Swap Respin. As a result, the winning symbol replaces all low-playing equivalents, which increases the potential to win during respins. Furthermore, winning four, five, or six in a row awards the player a ‚Äúcolossal symbol‚Äú, which leads to larger symbols with bigger prizes. Last but not least, players can also hit a ‚Äúwild colossal symbol‚Äù on any spin, which leads to big cash prizes.</p>
