    <h1>Four Winds Casino South Bend Indiana Red Dog Casino No Deposit Bonus Schenectady Casino My Choice Ca</h1>

<p>The fast-growing business-to-business (B2B) iGaming industry supplier, Push Gaming, was recently recognized for its efforts in terms of information security systems after being awarded a prestigious certification. The company confirmed last week that it secured an ISO/IEC 27001 certification, recognizing its commitment to the highest standards of information security management.</p>
<p>To secure the prestigious certification, Push Gaming's operations have undergone a nine-month assessment. Its processes have been through extensive testing to ensure they meet the strict assessment of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. Overall, Push Gaming had to meet the requirements of more than 100 clauses and controls to secure the accreditation.</p>
<p>Besides the company's processes, the assessment determines that Push Gaming's senior management team and operations now comply with the highest data protection practices. Those standards and practices are set by the International Electrotechnical Commission, as well as the International Organization for Standardization.</p>
<p>Fiona Hickey, Push Gaming's Director of New Business and Markets, shared her excitement in a statement saying: "This award is a great boost to our continued expansion as a company and signifies to our partners the way we do business."</p>
<p>Finally, she noted: "Itâ€™s vitally important that our standards are as high as possible across the board, which allows us to continue serving a growing number of operators and players with the utmost confidence."</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 is an internationally recognized certification. It acknowledges the efforts of companies to protect information assets by implementing extensive policies to keep data safe and secure. The certification is strategic, especially for operators that want to enter new jurisdictions. Not unexpectedly, the certification will also play a key role for Push Gaming, considering its ongoing expansion to new markets around the world.</p>
<p>"The studio is now able to assure its partners that their sensitive data is afforded the appropriate stringent, safe environment that is curated with as much care and importance as the leading content it delivers to them," explained the company.</p>
<p>The recent certification comes after earlier this month, Push Gaming announced its debut for the Italian iGaming market. The entry into one of the most lucrative European markets expanded further the company's presence on the Old Continent and enabled its popular games to reach new operators.</p>
<p>Before that, back in February, the company expanded further its European footprint after announcing a deal with 777.be. Per the terms of the new partnership, the company strengthened its presence in the online gambling market in Belgium.</p>
