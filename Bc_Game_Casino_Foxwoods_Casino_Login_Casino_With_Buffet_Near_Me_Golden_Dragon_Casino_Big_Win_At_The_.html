<p>Tottenham Hotspur welcome table-leaders Arsenal in the first North London Derby of 2023. The game is played on Sunday, and we think it‚Äôs going to be a real banger</p>
<p>North London Derbies are always entertaining, but this one‚Äôs gonna be special. It‚Äôs because both teams are fantastic in the 2022-23 season ‚Äì Arsenal are sitting top of the Premier League table; Tottenham are in fifth place right now.</p>

<p>The Spurs Always Show Up in the North London Derby</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur are 10-3-5 in the Premier League this season, which accounts for 33 points. That‚Äôs eleven points fewer than Arsenal, who have one game in hand as well. The chances are slim that the Spurs can challenge the title, but they definitely have every right to hope for a top 4 finish.</p>
<p>For that to happen, however, they need to get in a winning mode. Antonio Conte‚Äôs men are 1-1-1 in the Prem since the end of the World Cup, in which a number of their players took part. This explains why they didn‚Äôt do great in the first two games after the break ‚Äì they drew 2-2 with Brentford on Boxing Day and lost to Aston Villa 2-0 on New Year‚Äôs Day.</p>
<p>However, they got back onto the winning track on January 4, when they defeated Crystal Palace 4-0 in South London. This weekend, they‚Äôre coming back to the north of the city, which is where they‚Äôre 6-0-3 in the 2022-23 Premier League.</p>

<p>That might not seem too impressive, but the Spurs always seem to do well when playing against Arsenal at home. In fact, they won five of the previous six North London Derbies that took place on their turf. In those five wins, they scored a total of 10 goals, half of which were the work of their skipper Harry Kane.</p>
<p>After a slow start to the season, the Spurs No. 9 is playing fantastic soccer at the moment, scoring 15 Premier League goals in 18 matches. If Tottenham are going to beat Arsenal again, Kane will have to put on his best performance on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Gunners Need a Win</p>
<p>With 44 points (14-2-1), Arsenal is sitting in the No. 1 place in the Premier League. The trouble is that the reigning champions ‚Äì Manchester City ‚Äì are dangerously close behind. The Citizens are five points behind, but the season is long, and they seem more than capable of bridging that gap.</p>
<p>In fact, even oddsmakers believe Manchester City will overtake the top spot before the end of the season. One of the reasons is that the Gunners haven‚Äôt proved they can do great in big games.</p>
<p>This season, the only loss they suffered happened against Manchester United on the road. One of the draws they played happened in an away game against Southampton; the other one happened at home against Newcastle, the team currently occupying the No. 3 position in the Prem.</p>
<p>To be fair to Mikel Arteta‚Äôs boys, they did slay a couple of giants this season, including Liverpool and Tottenham. However, both of those wins happened at their stadium.</p>
<p>Tottenham vs Arsenal Prediction</p>
<p>We‚Äôre taking Tottenham in this game. The Spurs have a strong roster and a manager who just loves big games. Conte and his boys also seem to love playing against Arsenal, especially if the game‚Äôs taking place at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
<p>Picks: Tottenham Hotspur to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
