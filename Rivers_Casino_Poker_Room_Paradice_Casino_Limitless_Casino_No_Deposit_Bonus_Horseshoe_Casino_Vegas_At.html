<p>Only a day after Spinomenal, Relax Gaming becomes the second supplier of advanced online casino products to make a splash in the Greek iGaming market</p>
<p>The company, which is known for both its in-house development capabilities and its robust aggregation platform, has obtained a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission to move into the market.</p>
<p>Market Entry That Has Been Long in the Making</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has been interested in expanding in the country for a while now, and particularly after the major overhaul of the country’s gambling laws back in 2021.</p>
<p>Since then, Relax Gaming has been looking for a way to enter the legislation and introduce its titles, including esteemed and appreciated games such as Net Gains, Temple Tumble 2 Dream Drop, and the upcoming Money Train 3, which will now be available to Greece players.</p>
<p>Now, the company will finally have this opportunity, offering local players a taste of its bespoke products and the aggregation platform that brings no fewer than 4,000 online casino games.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming focuses on the provision of advanced high-performing slots and games by its own studio and third parties. The company has been awarded a range of distinctions, including the Slot and Casino Developer of the Year Award at the SBC Awards, and Best Game Provider at the AskGamblers Awards, among many others.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest news, Relax Gaming CRO Alexia Smilovic Ronde said that the company was very excited to obtain this iGaming Supplier License from the country’s regulator.</p>
<p>Ronde explained that Greece is a country where the iGaming market has a huge potential that is only going to grow in the coming months.</p>
<p>“We’ll keep a close eye on regional regulatory developments to continue with its successful journey of expansion in newly regulated markets,” she added. The company has made no immediate announcement as to which company it may be launching with just yet, but the company is expected to launch with a local operator in the first quarter of the year.</p>
