<p>Players can join the event by buying a ticket or qualifying through one of the satellite events</p>
<p>ACR Poker’s $5 million GTD Venom Progressive Knockout (PKO) Tournament is just around the corner, promising players “the biggest pots of their lives.” The recurring event is the world’s biggest PKO tournament and a major event on professional poker players’ schedules.</p>
<p>Set to return on October 19, the event will be the seventh Venom PKO event in ACR Poker’s history. The company told players to expect bounties to “grow to epic proportions.” According to the official announcement, deep into the event, a “knockout blow could be worth as much as tens of thousands of dollars.”</p>
<p>Buy-in for the event is $2,650, although players can also qualify for the event in other ways. For example, poker players can secure a ticket for the $5 million GTD Venom PKO Tournament through satellite events for only a fraction of the aforementioned cost.</p>
<p>ACR Poker guaranteed fans 633 seats through the satellite events, which run until Sunday, October 29. This means that players can potentially join the huge event for as little as $33 or fewer if they take advantage of the Mega Satellites. Alternatively, fans can enter through the Blitz Satellites and Step Tournaments, both starting at 11 cents.</p>
<p>Two Weeks of Intense Action Await</p>
<p>The exciting poker event is set to begin on October 19 and will run for almost two weeks. The final table is set to take place on Wednesday, November 1.</p>
<p>ACR Pro Chris Moneymaker commented on the upcoming $5 million GTD Venom PKO Tournament, sharing his excitement about the event.</p>
<p>Our Venom PKO is well known as the world’s biggest progressive knockout tourney. We will again have four day 1 options, and we expect to shatter the guarantee, just like the previous six times it has run.</p>
<p>Players can learn more about the $5 million GTD Venom PKO Tournament including how to enter the event on ACR Poker’s official website, or if you can’t wait, feel free to explore the top 10 best real money poker sites where you can find other cash tournaments.</p>
<p>Players should also familiarize themselves with the special terms of conditions and keep in mind that they cannot sell their primary ticket for the event. Additionally, ACR Poker warned that players who secure a spot for day 2 of the event are precluded from participating in any other day 1 flight to accumulate a larger chip stack.</p>
