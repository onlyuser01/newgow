    <h1>Slots Casino Real Money Lucky Lady Casino Best Online Casino New Jersey Legends Casino Hotel Sam S H</h1>

<p>Dear Jenny1308,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found https://888starz.bet/en/information/rules/:</p>
<p>"For customers who want to set limits on their gambling we offer a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which allows you to close your Account or to restrict your gambling activities on the Service for a period of up to 1 (one) year. Once your Account has been self-excluded, it will be closed until the expiry of the selected period. At the expiry of the self-exclusion period, you will be able to re-commence the use of any Services by contacting Customer Support.</p>
<p>If you want to set limits on your online activity then contact us at block@888starz.bet. We may limit the maximum amount of your stake. You can amend these amounts in any time but any change will be realized only in 24 hours after the last update.</p>
<p>During the self-exclusion period you must not attempt to open a new Account and you must accept that the Company shall have no financial liability and shall not be held otherwise accountable if you continue gambling or using a new Account with the Service under a different name or address. In exceptional cases, a customer's account may be unblocked before the self-exclusion period expires."</p>
<p>I would recommend sending an email including all the relevant information to block@888starz.bet. In this way you’ll have proof of such an action. Specify in the request for how long you wish your account to be closed and clearly state the reason why. Additionally, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you need any assistance and keep me updated. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
