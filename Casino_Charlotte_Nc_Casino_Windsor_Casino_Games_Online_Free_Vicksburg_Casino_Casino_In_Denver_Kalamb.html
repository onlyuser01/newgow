    <h1>Casino Charlotte Nc Casino Windsor Casino Games Online Free Vicksburg Casino Casino In Denver Kalamb</h1>

<p>2016-launched next-gen business-to-business iGaming supplier Kalamba Games has released Rumble Ratz Megaways, its first premium Megaways slot. The game has the popular cat versus mouse theme and counts a massive number of payways and K-cash, Megwayas, and Buy Bonus options.</p>
<p>Rumble Ratz Megaways Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Join the Small Furry Friends Band!</p>
<p>Kalamba Games’ co-founder and chief operating officer Alex Cohen spoke about the new game’s “engaging features, changeable reel sizes” made possible via the popular Megaways mechanic and impressive maximum win going over 5,000x. He added the company was positive about the game quickly turning into a “big hit with slot enthusiasts” all over the world. The game invites players to join the curious gang made of small furry friends while walking in the shoes of Rumble Ratz in their attempt to outsmart the cat while looking for cheese and, of course, huge wins. The whole Kalamba Gaming team brought its contribution to the release of the game that brings a fresh twist on the Megaways mechanic, creating a premium-looking slot that will be immediately recognized by all Kalambians.</p>
<p>All six reels are packed with symbols displaying different rat protagonists together with the wild symbol that replaces the rest of the symbols with the exception of the K-Cash symbol.</p>
<p>Sweet Dreams Are Made of Cheese!</p>
<p>When players land the K-Cash symbols and collect the cheese, the Megaways mechanic automatically boosts the height of all columns up to six, beefing up all available pay ways and players’ odds of winning. The respective value is gradually accumulated and visible on top of the grid, being eventually awarded when the K-Cash reset symbol lands.</p>
<p>To get Free Spins, players need to come across a minimum of three bonus symbols. Upon entering the Rumble Ratz free spins round, players are granted a number of three respins. The feature is available for retriggering every time the reel is expanded and reaches a height of six rows via the K-Cash feature. The collected amount corresponding to the K-Cash symbols is then multiplied by climbing a ladder featuring progressive multipliers. Each step of the ladder unlocks and expands a brand new reel.</p>
<p>HyperBonus for Bonus Rounds</p>
<p>Players can also unlock the HyperBonus feature to enter the bonus round that comes with three different K-Cash multiplier options: 4x, 7x, and 10x. The game displays cool, crisp graphics and interesting animations and it is packed with card royals and rats icons as symbols. Mobile players can access the game on smartphones and tablets and enjoy the same high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Kalamba Games started distributing its gaming content via the Gaming Innovation Group platform.</p>
