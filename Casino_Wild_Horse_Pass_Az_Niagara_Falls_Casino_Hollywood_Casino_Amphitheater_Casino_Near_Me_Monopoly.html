    <h1>Casino Wild Horse Pass Az Niagara Falls Casino Hollywood Casino Amphitheater Casino Near Me Monopoly</h1>

<p>Hey there - thanks for bringing this to the light.</p>
<p>It might be good to paste the explanation provided by the casino right here on the forum as well:</p>
<p>"Let us explain the situation;</p>
<p>This is an ongoing process that we are undertaking at Pledoo. We are assisting our customers in reclaiming their funds through a chargeback procedure due to issues encountered with the payment system provider involved in processing these payments, which resulted in the funds not being received by us.</p>
<p>We have initiated this process because we firmly believe that it aligns with industry standards and, more importantly, because we genuinely want to assist our customers in recovering their funds.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the funds did not reach us, and therefore the most appropriate course of action is to return the money to our customers. Despite our efforts to resolve the issue with the payment system provider internally and directly, they are unwilling to cooperate. Therefore, the subsequent course of action entails working closely with the customers' banks, and we are ready to provide comprehensive assistance and step-by-step guidance.</p>
<p>We understand the customer's concerns and skeptical mindset about the matter. Still, we want to ensure that everything is legal and we have the customer's best intentions in mind.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Pledoo Team</p>
