<p>The fire, which ignited around 4 p.m., forced the temporary closure of two adjacent restaurants, with hopes of reopening later in the day, according to Fire Chief Scott Evans and Resorts President Mark Giannantonio. Black smoke billowed into the sky, accompanied by vivid orange flames beneath the Resorts Casino Hotel sign, creating a spectacle that drew onlookers, reported the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Aris Matos and his wife Michelle, diners from Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, witnessed the unfolding drama from inside the casino. Matos recounted the unfolding situation, explaining that they had continued dining, and he observed the smoke intensifying. He mentioned seeing a restaurant worker rushing outside with a fire extinguisher in an attempt to suppress the flames. However, the worker returned to the restaurant, instructing everyone to evacuate due to the flames being too substantial.</p>
