<p>Age of Troy review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Sing to me, Muse, of the accursed wrath of Achilles… cus this slot’s all about the city of Troy.</p>
<p>The reels are full of Greco-Asian paraphernalia. You can find ancient meditteranean pottery full of gold and olive oil in neat rows. Not quite a thousand ships, but a few, plus Helen’s whose face famously launched them. A somewhat softboy-looking Paris, her abductor or lover depending on which side of the war you take.</p>
<p>And of course the Greek horse, made of wood, and holding in its hollow belly the doom of a city. Playing Age of Troy, you’ll drift back in time on a ship of myth and legend.</p>
<p>Huge win with stacked top paying symbol of the game</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are simple, but elegant. The Greek font and background art sell the atmosphere well and the symbols are on theme and well drawn.</p>
<p>The animations are simple, but sufficient to make gameplay easy to follow.</p>
<p>There’s not much sound design, which is probably the biggest letdown. Some ambient sound or music could have elevated the game’s sense of atmosphere considerably.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Age of Troy is a five reel slot. It has three rows per reel and twenty win lines. There is a free spin bonus and four progressive jackpots, and players can use the gamble feature to bump up their volatility (already high in this game).</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty typical for a slot. Nothing too exciting here, but more or less all the features you would expect.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol.</p>
<p>Three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reel result in the player getting 12 free spins. During the free spins, the Wild symbols are stacked, making for bigger wins when they land. Free spins can be retriggered.</p>
<p>Big win in the Free Spins bonus game</p>
<p>Age of Troy is also part of the EGT four suit progressive jackpots. The jackpot can be awarded at the end of any random spin. When triggered, the player is given a picking game with twelve cards. The player picks cards until they get three of the same suit. The jackpot associated with that suit is then awarded to the player.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96%, spot on our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€120.00 per spin, a good range that should work for most players’ bet sizes.</p>
<p>Full paytable for Age of Troy slot machine</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it an excellent match for our preferred slot machine strategies which target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The front end of Age of Troy is solid and simple. The gameplay features cover most players' needs, and the visuals are decent if unexciting.</p>
<p>The real place this slot shines though is under the hood. The 96% RTP is right in the middle of our range for average. Couple that with the very high volatility and you have a pretty good candidate slot to play with our preferred slot strategies.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this fun historical slot.</p>
