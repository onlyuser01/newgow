<p>888 Holdings has strengthened the leadership team of its US-based branch by appointing the media heavyweight Howard Mittman as president.</p>
<p>Mittman Named President of 888’s US Business</p>
<p>Mittman has years of experience in executive positions in the media sector. He has served as the chief revenue officer and publisher for Condé Nast and as a chief media executive for the sports and sports culture website Bleacher Report. Mittman has held several advisory positions in various companies, including EverBlock Systems, TPG Integrated Media, and KERV Interactive.</p>
<p>As the president of 888’s US arm, Mittman will be responsible for the company’s business-to-business operations, which include a partnership with the famous World Series of Poker tournament series. Mittman will also oversee the launch of 888’s Sports Illustrated sportsbook.</p>
<p>Mittman is delighted by the opportunity to work for one of the betting industry’s “most respected and successful businesses.” He lauded 888’s commitment to innovation, its customer-oriented approach, and its market-leading products.</p>
<p>Mittman added that the 888 workers he has met have impressed him with their passion for ensuring the best experience for customers. He hopes that his work with them will help the company grab the “significant opportunities ahead.”</p>
<p>Mittman Joins at a “Hugely Exciting Point” for 888</p>
<p>Itai Pazner, the chief executive officer of 888, welcomed Mittman to the company, noting that the latter will be responsible for launching the Sports Illustrated brand into several new US jurisdictions in the coming months and years. The CEO praised the new appointee’s impressive track record and said that he is the perfect man for the job.</p>
<p>Daniel W. Dienst, executive vice chairman of Authentic Brand Group, the company helping 888 run the Sports Illustrated brand, agreed that Mittman is a good fit for the role. According to him, the new president is sure to help Sports Illustrated improve its business. Dienst added that he is excited to capitalize on the opportunity to “build a differentiated wagering experience for the loyal and avid fans of sports.”</p>
<p>Pazner described the current period as a “hugely exciting point in 888’s long-term growth strategy in the US online betting market.” He noted that the company’s cutting-edge technology and expertise, alongside Mittman’s leadership, will help to improve the profitability of 888’s operations in the United States.</p>
<p>On a separate note, 888 is currently set to acquire the British brand William Hill from Caesars entertainment. However, the recent investigation of William Hill may force the British regulator to revoke the latter’s license, which prompted 888 and Caesars to amend their deal.</p>
