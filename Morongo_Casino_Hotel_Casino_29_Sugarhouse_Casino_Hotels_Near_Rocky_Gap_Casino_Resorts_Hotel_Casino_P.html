<p>The digital gaming platform governed by the Curaçao Gaming Commission, PlayLottoGlobal, announced its plans to significantly expand its global presence. Last week, the company confirmed that it will launch its leading live casino games, scratch cards, slots and lottery options in Brazil and Mexico on March 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Players in the two jurisdictions can expect unrivaled entertainment and casino options. Moreover, PlayLottoGlobal takes pride in offering one of the most popular and in fact, the 9th largest lottery options in the world.</p>
<p>Considering that the platform is 100% digital, to access it, the players will need an internet connection. However, PlayLottoGlobal will be available not only for desktop devices but for mobile devices as well. The platform will offer a variety of payment methods such as credit and debit cards, as well as cryptocurrencies and other online payment options. According to a statement released by PlayLottoGlobal, the payments will be in either Euros or US Dollars.</p>
<p>Todd Poindexter, PlayLottoGlobal's CEO and Founder, shared his excitement saying: "Our experienced, global team has been incredible as we prepare to launch the latest and most innovative digital gaming space that will offer users around the world a place to experience their favorite games from the comfort of their own home."</p>
<p>Finally, he explained: "Our platform also offers users and marketers the opportunity to participate in PlayLottoGlobal's invite-only, two-tier affiliate program, which gives them the opportunity to earn recurring, residual and passive income on customers they introduce who play the lottery, online casino and electronic games."</p>
<p>The upcoming launch from PlayLottoGlobal reaffirms its ongoing global growth plans. In fact, the company confirmed that by the end of Q1 this year, it anticipates its platform will be available in up to 180 countries around the world. Under its license by the Curaçao Gaming Commission, PlayLottoGlobal can operate in up to 180 different global jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recently, a lot of leading gambling companies saw the potential of the market in Brazil, which resulted in multiple launches and entries. Back in January, Pragmatic Play delivered its leading content for Aposta Certa customers in Brazil. Besides expanding the provider's offering, the recent deal boosted Pragmatic's global footprint.</p>
<p>Before that, back in December, Kambi Group inked a deal with Rei do Pitaco in Brazil. Under the multi-year partnership with the leading sportsbook technology provider, Rei do Pitaco will benefit from leveraging technology and services to boost its real money sportsbook operations in the country.</p>
