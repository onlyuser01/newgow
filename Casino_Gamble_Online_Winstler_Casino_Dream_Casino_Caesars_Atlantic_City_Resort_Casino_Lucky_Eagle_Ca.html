    <h1>Casino Gamble Online Winstler Casino Dream Casino Caesars Atlantic City Resort Casino Lucky Eagle Ca</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m going to try to make this long story short I got a bonus I made a deposit I played through all of my Playthru now Iâ€™m up over $5000. I decide Iâ€™m going cash out and I did I cashed out 5000 and left the rest in there . heard anything. I decide I want to play that I know Iâ€™m not allowed to play that game due to the restrictions and requirements of the bonus. So then I think well let me find out because Iâ€™m done with my Playthru and that money is already been taken out of play because itâ€™s in my withdrawals that are STILL pending . So I open up light chat and I say am I still bandit by the requirements of my bonus even though Iâ€™m done with that. Ahead after all the Playthru, which is rare.. so am I still buying it by these requirements after my place is finished I was told and I quote you are correct youâ€™re not going to buy the Playthru requirements( i have screen shots ) so I go and I play my roulette and I go to bed I wake up this morning. All of my money is going the money. I was trying to withdraw the money that I had left in my account so I get on the phone course is busy busy busy so I had to go through life chat and I explain to them just like I explained to you and he told me that was because I play roulette so imagine my surprise to hear that when I was just told the night before that, I was not binded by my bonus, because I finish the Playthru . And the money is no longer in play. Well, I was told thatâ€™s the way it is and I have to deal with it. The moneys gone because I played roulette. It didnâ€™t matter what anybody told me thatâ€™s the way it is and I have to deal with it and they had the audacity to try to give me $100 chip with 40x play through requirements to make up for what they done! ðŸ˜³ you can probably imagine where I told them to shove that shit. Question to them was why would anybody intentionally play a game that wasnâ€™t allowed? No when you have $5000 so you intentionally screwed up your money. Why would anybody do that so obviously I was under the impression that it was OK because one of THEIR employees said it was. And I was told thereâ€™s nothing I can do but they have to be something I can do that is the most unfair treatment and I told them Sell and I said I hope they shut your ass down for this. You canâ€™t screw hard-working people over like this it was misleading and. .</p>
