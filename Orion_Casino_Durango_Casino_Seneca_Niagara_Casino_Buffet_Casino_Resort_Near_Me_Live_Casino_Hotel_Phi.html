<p>When sports betting ads flood your social media feed or the ongoing TV broadcast, they often issue testy challenges. “Do you have what it takes,” some of them ask rhetorically? Yet, there is one sports betting website that will happily pay you for “just” watching and perhaps only seek to test your knowledge of the sport, rather than ask you to wager money.</p>
<p>Test Your Knowledge of Super Bowl, Win Money</p>
<p>The Game Day, a sports betting operator, is now going to pay up $2,022 for watching Super Bowl LVI and taking the site’s questionnaire. The operator wants you to make sure you have your eyes on the big game throughout the entire broadcast, including the halftime and post-game shows. This is not everyone’s cup of tea, but if you do pay attention and are the selected candidate, this is how you earn some buck quickly.</p>
<p>So, what’s The Game Day going to do? The website will ask you 15 NFL-themed questions, but don’t worry. You will earn money for each question you answer successfully while losing nothing. The website is paying $134.80 for each answer you get right. Plus, you won’t be penalized for not answering a question right. You just carry on and try the next one.</p>
<p>The Game Day is somewhat specific in their preferences, though. The team wants to find a true football fan who has the ability to “recall iconic moments,” strong attention to detail, and “the ability and availability to monitor and analyze everything that happens on Super Bowl Sunday.”</p>
<p>Fill out the Form to Get Selected</p>
<p>If you needed an excuse to watch the NFL and not be distracted, it appears that this is it. To get your chance to participate, you need to fill out The Game Day’s online form. The form will take some time to complete, as it would effectively test your NFL knowledge and why you love football. You will be asked to describe your favorite franchise and why as well as pinpoint the final outcome of the game.</p>
<p>To comply with sports gambling laws in most of the United States, The Game Day has set the entry age at 21 which could be a bit of a let-down for some passionate football fans out there, but more such opportunities should be forthcoming as the sports betting market in the country is growing at a rapid pace.</p>
