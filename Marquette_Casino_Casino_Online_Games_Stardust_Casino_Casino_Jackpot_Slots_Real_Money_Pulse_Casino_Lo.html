<p>$25K Slot Machine Win Leads to Violent Home Invasion Robbery in Milwaukee</p>

<p>The luck of a Milwaukee man and his roommate changed drastically this past weekend after being attacked, bound and robbed — in their home — of the money he had won days before at Wisconsin’s Potawatomi Hotel and Casino.</p>

<p>Christopher Czarnecki got the win from the two separate visits this month to the slots at the gaming venue. He pocketed $12,000 on June 3 and $13,000 on June 5.</p>
<p>Some of the money went to buy a used car. Much of the balance wound up stored in a new safe that was kept in the residence.</p>
<p>“I was excited as heck,” Czarnecki told WTMJ-TV.</p>
<p>Only a few acquaintances knew he won. But on Saturday night, there was a knock at the rear door.</p>
<p>“The door kind of pushed opened a little bit while I was reaching for the handle,” roommate Hunter Marks told the TV station.</p>
<p>I looked to see a guy standing there with a mask on and a pistol pointing towards me. He nearly hit me in the mouth with it.”</p>
<p>Marks got into a struggle with the bandits.</p>
<p>“Next thing I know I see the first dude come in with the gun. Then I see two more people behind him,” Czarnecki recounted.</p>
<p>One of the thugs used the gun to strike Marks. Both Marks and his 77-year-old mother were restrained with plastic ties placed on their hands — as were Czarnecki and his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Czarnecki was ordered to open the safe.</p>
<p>“I thought they were going to kill me. I honestly did,” Czarnecki said.</p>
<p>The bandits scooped up the money. They forced the four victims into a bedroom.</p>
<p>Before fleeing, the robbers positioned a stove to block the bedroom door. Moments later, Czarnecki and Marks were able to kick open the door.</p>
<p>Any injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Czarnecki told the TV station if he won again, “the bank’s probably the better way.”</p>
<p>Police are continuing to look for the suspects.</p>
<p>High-Tech Robbers</p>
<p>Hearing a rumor about a winner is not the only way robbers find out someone has cash in their residence.</p>
<p>In 2015, robbers watched for frequent patrons in a Baltimore casino. They identified one, and then placed a GPS device on his car located nearby, and tracked him to his home.</p>
<p>Later, two residents were robbed at a Montgomery County residence where the identified gambler lived. Each was restrained by zip ties and bound by duct tape before the robbers fled with $6,000, according to The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Casinos Can Issue a Check</p>
<p>Following the Milwaukee robbery, the Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino released a statement to WTMJ that — in part — reminds patrons big winners can opt to take their winnings in a check instead of cash.</p>
<p>While on casino property, winners can be escorted to their vehicle by venue security officers. Though that could bring more attention to them while at the casino.</p>
<p>Slot machine winners with higher payoffs will get attention automatically. A light goes off on the machine and music starts to play.</p>
<p>It can be five minutes or more before a staff member comes over. The employee may ask for an ID and may also check the machine for possible malfunctions.</p>
<p>Following that, perhaps 10 minutes will pass before the winner gets the cash. One employee may count out the money and another is likely there to watch.</p>
<p>Expect a much longer wait if a winner asked for a check from the casino. Often, banks will cash these checks quickly recognizing the venue and its credit trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Taking the money in cash is not a way around reporting about the winnings to tax authorities. A win over $1,200 is reported to the IRS automatically and winners will receive a W9 form.</p>
<p>Potawatomi Tribe Tries to Limit Competition</p>
<p>On another front, last November, the Potawatomi tribe agreed to an amended compact with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, ending a 15-year dispute over gambling expansion and revenue-share payments.</p>
<p>The tribe will withhold $250 million in payments to the state if another tribe is one day permitted to build a casino in the region.</p>
