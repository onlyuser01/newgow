    <h1>Hollywood Casino Jobs Stick Resort Casino Border Casino Oklahoma Casino Florida Fort Lauderdale Sout</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not 100 procent sure about verification, but before i was able to do anything they asked my my proof of ID and on email i got an mail regarding account registration. Then i was able to deposit and play.</p>
<p>Thing is i tried to withdraw my funds since start of december. It didnt go through so i contacted them, they have been replying since start. What they said first time was there was error on their side of bank, so they refunded money back to my gaming account and asked to try to withdraw again. So i did it, it got stuck again. So i contacted them again and they said the same thing. So this happenes like 4 5 times. It just went like a loop, fault on their side and so i try again. Last time i got pissed and said to them, can they check where is the problem, they said money takes to arrive 2 to 5 banking days. I replied that i can not take this money out, so maybe they check something they replied that i tried to withdraw money on 6th of January which is not 1.5 months. I replied, so they check our conversation and replies they start from start of december and maybe they should check more into the case. And that was it. They said they will bring the case to the relevant department, but it will only occur the same process again that i try again and wait. I mean i would want them to check where is trouble, maybe its my account or details or smth, i just felt they were trying to fool me around and didnt take any serious actions.</p>
