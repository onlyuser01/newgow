<p>Andrew Higginson, one of Flutter Entertainment’s directors, will be departing from its board. He will officially leave in December, ending his time with the company.</p>
<p>Higginson to Leave Flutter in 2023</p>
<p>Higginson is currently senior independent director at Flutter, non-executive director Evergreen Garden Care, non-executive director at Warburtons and chair at JD Sports Fashion. He joined Flutter as a non-executive director in 2019 and has since worked with its board.</p>
<p>Higginson has a lot of experience in both executive and non-executive roles and is very knowledgeable on commercial and retail matters. His past experiences include a tenure as the chair of Wm Morrison Supermarkets and 15 years on Tesco’s board. In the past, Higginson also chaired the Poundland Group and N Brown. He also used to work as a senior independent director at Sky and NED at the Rugby Football Union.</p>
<p>McGann Thanked the SID for His Contributions</p>
<p>Gary McGann, chairman of Flutter Entertainment, spoke about Higginson’s leave and thanked him for his time with the company. McGann emphasized that Higginson contributed a lot to the London Stock Exchange-listed operator and helped the company grow. McGann is glad that Higginson’s leave is not with an immediate effect and thanked him for opting to stay until the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Since joining the board in 2019, Andy has provided Flutter with the benefit of his extensive business leadership experience which the company will continue to benefit from until the end of the year. Gary McGann, chair, Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>Starting next month, Higginson will vacate the seat of chair of the remuneration committee. He will be replaced by Alfred Hurley Junior. Holly Keller, on the other hand, will replace Higginson as a SID starting January 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Flutter’s Team Underwent a Reshuffling</p>
<p>Higginson isn’t the only Flutter worker who will be leaving the company in 2023. Conor Grant, chief executive of Flutter’s UK and Ireland-facing business, also announced his departure from the operator. At the end of 2022, Grant will allow Ian Brown to take over the Flutter. In a statement, Grant said he fully trusts Brown and believes he is leaving the company in safe hands.</p>
<p>Grant’s announcement came a few weeks after the leave of Paddy Power’s CEO, Victor Corcoran. Both Flutter and Corcoran refrained from commenting on the matter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media and PR heavyweight Steve Hawkes joined Flutter a month ago. Hawkes was named director of reputational/public affairs for Ireland and the United Kingdom and will work to help Flutter connect with its customers.</p>
<p>In other news, Flutter recently posted its H1 results, showcasing a 9% year-on-year increase in its revenues.</p>
