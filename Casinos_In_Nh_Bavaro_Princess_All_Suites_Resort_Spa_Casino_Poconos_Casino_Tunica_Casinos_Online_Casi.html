<p>Dear SERZ15,</p>
<p>After gathering all the necessary information and after having an internal discussion with my team, we decided to close this complaint as unjustified - as was already mentioned, there are reasonable grounds to believe we are talking about using someone else's identity to register in 7Signs and/or 5Gringos Casino. It would be very hard or even impossible to prove anything else. Especially if there were suspicious payments between these players.</p>
<p>Successful verification is a must in most online casinos, and the personal information provided must be true and in the player's name. Unfortunately, the casino and its sister casinos are owned by the same company, and all of them have access to the data filled in by players, and the account in 5Gringos even has not been fully verified. Therefore, we understand the casino's attitude and suspicions regarding your identity. Although the account in 5Gringos could have been made by your friend, it does not make sense, and it is one of the reasons why we agree with the casino's decision. The casino acted in accordance with its terms and conditions, and we accept its decision.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that regulates the casino. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, 7Signs Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
