<p>UK-based gaming technology producer International Game Technology (IGT) is expanding its offering for the US sports betting market by building its own full-service Trading Team, the company announced today. The addition will be based in Las Vegas and will add another dimension to IGT’s PlaySports sports betting solution.</p>
<p>Focus on Customer Service</p>
<p>The Trading Team will support IGT’s sports betting terminals, PlaySports, by providing odds-making with localized pricing as for pre-game, so for in-play bets. Furthermore, the diverse team will continually monitor and optimize the platform and will be ready to provide on-call expertise regarding every aspect of routine sports book operations. Its addition will make the most widely deployed B2B sports betting solution in the US even more appealing to customers.</p>
<p>“IGT’s in-house, U.S.-based Trading Team enhances the appeal of the entire PlaySports offering and enables us to deliver an ‘all-in-one’ solution for operators seeking a single sports betting service provider.” Enrico Drago, Senior Vice President, PlayDigital, IGT</p>
<p>PlaySports’ clients will be offered compelling and original promotional bets, wagering combinations and exclusive parlay, as well as strategies for player retention and new client acquisitions designed by the new team’s content managers, looking to further cement IGT’s leading market position.</p>
<p>“IGT PlaySports’ pure B2B focus, the Trading Team’s in-depth knowledge of regional and local betting preferences and trends, and the Company’s favorable regulatory standings in tribal and state-governed jurisdictions across the U.S. continue to create opportunities for our customers and drive our nationwide sports betting leadership.” Enrico Drago, Senior Vice President, PlayDigital, IGT</p>
<p>IGT PlaySports is already featuring more than 200 kiosks installed in 40 gaming outlets across 14 US jurisdictions, and the flexibility and reliability of the platform has long been recognized by its customers as its greatest attributes. Adding services as the ones provided by the Trading Team will complete the sports betting solution and will improve customer experience, Enrico Drago outlined.</p>
<p>IGT PlaySports Presence Across the US</p>
<p>Retail and online sports books run by casinos, lotteries and racetracks and via mobile apps in the states of Nevada, Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Oregon, Indiana, Iowa, West Virginia, Mississippi and Rhode Island can rely on the fully integrated PlaySports platform, backed now by world-class trading service.</p>
<p>Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming was the latest gaming operator to recognize the advantages of IGT PlaySports self-servicing sports betting kiosks. In August, the casino company signed a multi-year partnership with IGT under the terms of which Boyd’s Las Vegas gaming properties will feature the sports wagering solution.</p>
