<p>Juventus Ready for a Big Finish of the Season</p>
<p>It was a strange season for Juve so far. The Italian soccer powerhouse was deducted 15 points a few months ago, but the league decided to give them back to the black-and-whites. As a result, they’re now second in the Serie A standings.</p>
<p>Napoli have already secured the trophy, but Juve still have a chance to turn this season into a vintage one. If they finish second in the domestic league and win the Europa League, not even their biggest critics would have anything bad to say.</p>
<p>They definitely look capable of staying in the No. 2 position in Serie A, but can they win the Europa League? Oddsmakers think of this team as the main favorite with the odds of Juve winning the title being +200 at the moment. But to get a shot at the title, they need to deal with Sevilla in the semifinal first.</p>
<p>Sevilla Players Love This Competition</p>
<p>Sevilla is the team that’s won more Europa League/UEFA Cup titles than anyone else. With six wins, the Spanish team will remain the Europa League ruler for a long time. It’s because the four teams that share the second place on the all-time winners list each have just three titles in the collection.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that one of those four teams is Juventus. However, the last time the Italian heavyweight won this competition was exactly 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Sevilla, on the other hand, most recently won the Europa League in 2020. And these guys are determined to do it again. They’re not doing great in the Spanish league, so winning the trophy on the continent would mean salvaging the season.</p>
<p>Juventus vs Sevilla Prediction</p>
<p>Juventus players realize how tough Sevilla is. After all, the Spanish team is the one that knocked out the mighty Manchester United. That’s why you can be 100% certain that Juve will take this game seriously, aiming for a big win.</p>
<p>Prediction: Juventus to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
