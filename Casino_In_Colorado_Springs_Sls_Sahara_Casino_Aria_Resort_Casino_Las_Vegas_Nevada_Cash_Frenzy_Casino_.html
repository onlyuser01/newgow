    <h1>Casino In Colorado Springs Sls Sahara Casino Aria Resort Casino Las Vegas Nevada Cash Frenzy Casino</h1>

<p>Blueprint Gaming has inked a partnership agreement with Galaxy Gaming for the release of table games with Side Bets</p>
<p>At the start of March, Galaxy Gaming announced the launch of its 3 Dice Baccarat game at Aspers Casino Westfield. Now, the Las Vegas-based developer and distributor of innovative games, bonusing systems, and technology solutions, has signed an important licensing agreement with Blueprint Gaming.</p>
<p>Side Bets to Breathe New Life into Table Games</p>
<p>The leading UK-based game studio that belongs to Germany’s Gauselmann Group had chosen Galaxy Gaming for its popular, trademarked Side Bets feature.</p>
<p>Once it has been added to its table games in the second quarter, the Side Bets feature is expected to enhance the engagement potential for Blueprint Gaming’s table games while breathing fresh life into the gameplay.</p>
<p>The freshly licensed Side Bets features will become available across Blueprint Gaming’s entire portfolio of table games in all the jurisdictions the studio currently operates in.</p>
<p>The first game that will reach the portfolio will be Blackjack Player’s Choice with as many as six Side Bets made available on the date of the launch.</p>
<p>The terms of the new agreement also include the 21+3, which is the leading Side Bet on online and brick-and-mortar gaming venues. The game reunites two of the most popular casino card games on the planet, Blackjack and Three Card Poker.</p>
<p>21+ 3 has been proven to offer high-paced action at the tables and an overall growing table win and hold.</p>
<p>What Else Does the Deal Include?</p>
<p>According to Galaxy Gaming’s director of iGaming Jason McCulloch, the newly signed licensing partnership will also include other popular titles like Lucky Ladies, Perfect Pairs, Suit’em Up, Lucky Lucky, and Buster Blackjack.</p>
<p>McCulloch described the games as “some of the most popular side bet titles in the world” while expressing excitement to watch them bring new thrills to players in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming’s director of key accounts and marketing UK Jo Purvis acknowledged their games’ trusted performance over the years while expressing their interest in constantly offering new experiences for players and operators alike.</p>
<p>Purvis called Galaxy Gaming’s Side Bets “the perfect tool that would help boost player engagement and revenue growth through their potential of adding fresh ways of enjoying their favorite table games.</p>
<p>Galaxy Gaming has established itself as a premium provider of proven games with top-tier performance. Via its Progressive Games Partners subsidiary, the company is considered the leading licensor of proprietary table games for the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>In January, Blueprint Gaming signed an agreement with NorthStar Gaming as a means of building more momentum in the Canadian gaming market through the launch of its portfolio of slots for Ontario players.</p>
