    <h1>Casino Mafia Movie Northern Quest Resort Casino The D Hotel And Casino Mgm Grand Hotel Casino Vegas</h1>

<p>HungryBear, the up-and-coming UK and Canada-based game studio, is now intent on expanding its innovative Slot Masters tournament series with the addition of more original content and products.</p>
<p>To this end, the company has signed a partnership with Blueprint Gaming which will allow HungryBear to access the former’s IP and games portfolio and create unique experiences to be incorporated into the Slot Masters solution, Casino Guru News learned in a press release.</p>
<p>The partnership benefits both companies as HungryBear will continue to innovate the experience by bringing more worthwhile games inspired by popular and player-favorite games whereas Blueprint will get another opportunity to strike home with new crowds who may be unfamiliar with its games.</p>
<p>Both companies stand to extend their reach. Slot Masters has been quickly becoming a top-of-the-range experience in iGaming with players enjoying a head-to-head multiplayer experience that is played in a free format.</p>
<p>HungryBear has promoted the tournament series as one of its flagship products and a format in which players can make strategic choices about the opponents’ scores. Commenting on the new opportunity to grow the available IPs that the company can base its products on, HungryBear CEO Justin Chamberlain said:</p>
<p>The partnership with Blueprint allows us to further enhance and improve the Slot Masters experience by offering players the opportunity to play the world’s leading multiplayer game with the legendary and industry-leading content and IP that Blueprint own.</p>
<p>He thanked the company for the opportunity to expand and said that HungryBear was looking forward to incorporating award-winning and player-favorite titles such as Luck O’ The Irish, Wish Upon a Jackpot, King Kong Cash, and Fishin’ Frenzy among the games that will be featured in the Slot Masters format with modifications to fit the format.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming Managing Director Matt Cole has welcomed the opportunity to see this new partnership take place and allow for the company’s products to be reimagined based on new and popularmechanics and concepts. He hailed the Slot Masters format as a truly innovative solution that appeals to a wide audience of players and that is bound to have a positive impact on the brand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, HungryBear has been looking to expand as well. The company recently signed a partnership with Light &amp; Wonder to strengthen its distribution channels and strike home with new audiences.</p>
