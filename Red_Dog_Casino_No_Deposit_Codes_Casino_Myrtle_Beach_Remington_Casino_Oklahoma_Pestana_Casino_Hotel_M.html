<p>MGA Games will explore the Portuguese gaming market thanks to a new agreement with Moosh.</p>
<p>MGA Games, an expert in localized gaming products for global casino operators, has been selected as the latest partner of Caravel Entertainment, a company creating innovative, safe and trustworthy experiences for gambling enthusiasts.</p>
<p>MGA Games Supplies Caravel’s Brand with Content</p>
<p>Under the agreement with Caravel, MGA Games will supply Moosh, one of the operator’s online gambling brands, with iGaming content. As a result, the Portuguese online casino company will be able to offer exciting games to its fans, featuring characters such as Paolo Futre, Chef Chakall, Diego Miranda, Carolina Mendes, Ana Catharina, Fanny Rodrigues and Teresa Guilherme.</p>
<p>This deal will allow MGA Games to expand its footprint while providing Moosh with engaging content to offer to its customers. The companies have been keen on expanding their iGaming footprint, which is why the deal was welcomed by both parties’ teams.</p>
<p>Javier Lanfranchi, MGA Games’ sales director, commented on the matter. He said that he feels honored that Moosh opted to pick MGA Games as its latest partner in Portugal. Lanfranchi promised to not let down Moosh and its customer base and promised to provide the operator with content that will surprise its users.</p>
<p>We are sure our Portuguese Celebrities and wide and varied catalog of slot games will impress their players. Javier Lanfranchi, sales director, MGA Games</p>
<p>Lanfranchi also reaffirmed that MGA Games’ content is produced with the utmost care using the best technology available. As a result, its games provide mobile players with intuitive solutions and tools that enhance the overall gaming experience. Example solutions include the Triple View system and sequential downloading.</p>
<p>MGA Continues to Push Forward</p>
<p>A week ago, MGA Games announced the beginning of its expansion in Africa through an agreement with Premier Bet. This made MGA Games one of the pioneers on the continent, allowing it to tap into a market that has been somewhat neglected by many big companies.</p>
<p>Seeking to engage African casino lovers, MGA Games powered Premier Bet’s content offering with a rich variety of games, including hit titles such as Buffalo Bingo, Sweet Home, Bingo Sea, Magician, Roma Bingo and Calaca Party, among others.</p>
<p>While untapped markets are of great interest to MGA Games, the company has also been working hard to consolidate its presence in established jurisdictions as well. To that end, in December, the supplier inked an agreement with SOFTSWISS, adding content to the latter company’s aggregator platform. As a result, SOFTSWISS partners will be able to access MGA Games’ rich portfolio of iGaming titles.</p>
