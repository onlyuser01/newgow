<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has announced that the PGA TOUR has joined its Leadership Circle, a group of organizations that support the NCPG's efforts to mitigate the harm associated with gambling</p>
<p>As part of this membership, the PGA Tour has committed to investing in the NCPG to ensure its long-term sustainability, future growth, and innovation.</p>
<p>PGA Tour’s Broad Reach Will Help Raise Awareness of Problem Gambling</p>
<p>To promote Problem Gambling Awareness Month in March, the PGA TOUR will launch a cross-platform marketing campaign that will use a variety of media channels to provide educational resources and messages to its fanbase.</p>
<p>Scott Warfield, the PGA Tour’s VP of gaming, highlighted that joining the NCPG’s Leadership Circle is a natural fit for the PGA Tour:</p>
<p>Properly preparing and educating our fanbase on responsible gambling will always be a key focal point of our sports betting strategy at the PGA Tour. The National Council on Problem Gambling is committed to those same causes, and we are proud to join their Leadership Circle as we continue to promote the core values of responsible wagering. Scott Warfield, VP of gaming, PGA Tour</p>
<p>The PGA Tour is one of several leading sports and betting organizations that are members of the NCPG’s Leadership Circle, including FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>Keith Whyte, the executive director of the NCPG, expressed his appreciation for the partnership with the PGA Tour and stressed the importance of promoting responsible gambling practices to golf fans nationwide. He noted that the PGA Tour’s broad reach provides a unique opportunity to increase public awareness of problem gambling and the various resources available for those seeking help.</p>
<p>By collaborating with the PGA Tour, Whyte hopes to make meaningful strides toward mitigating the harm associated with excessive gambling and empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their gambling behavior.</p>
<p>The Leadership Circle Membership Is One More Addition to the PGA Tour Initiatives</p>
<p>The partnership between the PGA Tour and the NCPG is the latest in a series of industry-leading initiatives by the organization since the 2018 Supreme Court decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).</p>
<p>In January this year, the PGA Tour joined forces with US Integrity, which is now using its innovative technology to proactively identify any irregular patterns in contests, officiating, and wagering.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour also extended its collaboration with Genius Sports, providing educational programs for players, caddies, and officials to enhance the PGA Tour’s regulations and raise awareness of the risks associated with corruption related to betting activities.</p>
<p>In addition to these partnerships and the latest collaboration with the NCPG, the PGA Tour holds a platinum membership with the NCPG and is partnering with the American Gaming Association in their “Have A Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” program. These collaborations and initiatives aim to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game across all aspects of the premium golf tournaments managed by the PGA Tour and show the organization’s commitment to tackling problem gambling.</p>
