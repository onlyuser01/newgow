<p>South Dakota has become the latest state to accept sports wagering license applications as the United States towards the full legalization of its sports betting industry.</p>
<p>License Applications Are Available on the Commission’s Site</p>
<p>South Dakota will accept sports betting license applications. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming has announced that it will start accepting those applications on July 1. The license applications are available since May 20 on the Commission site.</p>
<p>Voters approved the Deadwood sports betting legalization amendment on November 3, 2020. The state legislature authorized sports wagering specifically within Deadwood city. Even though it is no longer illegal, sports wagering is not yet available in the state. The legislature is targeting September 1, 2021, as a possible launch date. Once sports betting launches in South Dakota, fans would be able to place bets at Deadwood casinos.</p>
<p>Deadwood’s gambling facilities reopened in March. According to the state commission, casinos in the city had a 102% increase in gambling handle, compared to the same time in 2020, and a 61% increase compared to March 2019.</p>
<p>Rules and Fees</p>
<p>The House Committee rejected mobile wagering statewide, which would have allowed South Dakotans to bet through their mobile devices. Now, they will have to make their bets only in land-based casinos in Deadwood. Along with many safety and security measures, applicants or licensed premises are not allowed to refuse to give records upon requests by the Commission. Anyone who is a part of the market, like equipment suppliers, licensees, and service providers, will not be allowed to place bets on any of the sporting events.</p>
<p>The application fee for providers who wish to offer sports wagering services is $5,000. Facilities that want to offer sports wagering will have to pay a $2,000 incenses fee and a $2,000 annual renewal fee.</p>
<p>History of the Bill</p>
<p>After South Dakotans approved the constitutional amendment in November 2020 for Deadwood, the bill awaited to pass in the South Dakota Senate, the Senate finally voted with 32-2 in February.</p>
<p>After that, the state’s House Representatives passed it with a vote of 58-8 in March, and Governor Kristi Noem signed the bill in March.</p>
<p>In February, another House Bill sought to allow sports betting at alcohol-selling facilities like bars and restaurants, but it was killed with a 9-4 in the House State Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Legal gambling activities in South Dakota include off-track and online horse betting, lottery, daily fantasy games, and gambling at one of the 12 tribal casinos spread across the state. Now, sports betting will also be added to that list of gaming activities.</p>
