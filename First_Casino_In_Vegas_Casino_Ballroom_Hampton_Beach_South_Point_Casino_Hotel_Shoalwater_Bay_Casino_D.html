<p>Sports betting in the US has been continuously increasing its popularity as more states are legalizing and introducing the activity. Along with that, came esports betting and even betting on scripted events. As a result, some states currently offer betting on the Emmy Awards or the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Now, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is reportedly also probing the possibility of betting on scripted matches, a report released by CNBC reveals. By definition, scripted speech represents a text written before it is read or performed. In the case of WWE, the matches are scripted before they happen and carry a storyline.</p>
<p>According to people close to the matter, to ensure the integrity of betting, WWE matches would be scripted months ahead. This will undoubtedly change the way they are produced but it may open a door for an expansion of the WWE to new audiences and pick the interest of new or even seasoned bettors.</p>
<p>Besides scripting matches ahead, to ensure the integrity of the betting, WWE reportedly plans to keep the results of the matches hidden from the wrestlers. They would likely know the script of the match but won't be told of the outcome until hours before the start. In other words, the wrestlers would know if they are losing or winning just before the game, says the new report citing people close to the matter.</p>
<p>The new report by CNBC claimed that people involved in the process revealed that WWE is collaborating with Ernst &amp; Young (EY), a leading accounting firm, to probe chances of pushing for the legalization of scripted match betting in different states. This is not a coincidence considering that EY, as well as PwC have collaborated with the Emmy Awards and the Academy Awards to ensure the secrecy of the results.</p>
<p>Reportedly, WWE is looking into legalization options for markets in Indiana, Colorado and Michigan. This is likely a strategic move as currently, World Wrestling Entertainment has a registration with the gambling regulator in Indiana, the Indiana Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>According to the recent report, the gambling regulator in Colorado, the Colorado Division of Gaming, isn't planning to allow or introduce wagering on WWE scripted matches. What's more, currently the state doesn't allow placing bets on fixed outcome events.</p>
<p>Even if WWE manages to push the legalization of betting on scripted matches in some of the states, it would then need to team up with a sports betting operator. Currently, operators that offer similar options such as betting on the Academy Awards include DraftKings, as well as FanDuel.</p>
