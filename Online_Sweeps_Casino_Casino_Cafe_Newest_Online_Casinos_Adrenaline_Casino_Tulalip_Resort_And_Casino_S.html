<p>The deal with Sky Bet will notably mark the very first time Grey London has worked with a gambling company</p>
<p>British gambling operator Sky Bet has selected Grey London as an agency partner, replacing the outgoing Who Wot Why. The operator is excited about the change and believes that a bright future awaits Sky Bet and its new ally.</p>
<p>As the agency of record of Sky Bet, Grey London will manage the gambling company’s advertising account in the United Kingdom. The agency will be responsible for developing a long-term strategic brand platform for Sky Bet and affirming it as a leader in the British market.</p>
<p>This will notably mark the first time Grey London has managed a gambling company. Previous entities Grey London has worked with include companies and organizations such as Pfizer, Pringles, the United Nations and Volvo.</p>
<p>The UK Introduced Stricter Advertising Laws</p>
<p>For the past few years, Who Wot Why served as Sky Bet’s agency. However, the introduction of stricter advertising rules by the Advertising Standards Authority prompted Sky Bet to introduce a change.</p>
<p>Under the renewed rules, gambling companies should avoid appealing to minors. As a result, they are prohibited from using celebrities and famous athletes in their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, Sky Bet came under scrutiny for a marketing campaign featuring the ex-soccer professional Micah Richards. Since Richards is retired, the Advertising Standards Authority concluded that the ad does not appeal to young audiences and did not reprimand the operator.</p>
<p>Grey London Is the Perfect Agency for Sky Bet</p>
<p>Grey London’s joint managing director, Jonny Tennant Price, commented on the agreement. He praised Sky Bet as a rare instance of a client that is truly dedicated and passionate about transforming its business. Price said that in the next few months, his team will be hard at work implementing a pioneering new brand strategy for the operator. He is certain that this will lead to exciting new creative work.</p>
<p>Leigh Peacock-Goodwin, Sky Bet’s head of brand marketing, also shared his sentiments on the agreement. He said that he sees “a bright and busy future” ahead of Sky Beta and its new partner. Peacock-Goodwin added that Sky Bet was looking for an agency partner that is able to help the operator chart a new and exciting stage for itself. Grey London is exactly what Sky Bet was looking for, the head of brand marketing concluded.</p>
<p>Last December, Sky Bet expanded its odds services partnership with Sporting Solutions. Thanks to that, the operator will continue to benefit from the latter company’s products through 2023.</p>
