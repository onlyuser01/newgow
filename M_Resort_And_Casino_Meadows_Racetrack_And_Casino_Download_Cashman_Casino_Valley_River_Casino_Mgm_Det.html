<p>NOVOMATIC continues to report strong performance for its digital gaming and entertainment industry, Greentube, which has completed another acquisition deal</p>
<p>Greentube has acquired Ineor, an established international software developer which will help the company to further strengthen its presence in the iGaming market and develop hard-hitting solutions that help advance the entire industry.</p>
<p>Greentube Grows Portfolio with Ineor</p>
<p>The company acquired 80% of the shares in the Slovenia-based company, and will now leverage its critical software development capabilities and resources to boost its own offer globally.</p>
<p>Ineor has an established track record in both computer programming and the development of dedicated gaming software. The company already provides its solutions in the digital sector for a number of multinational organizations.</p>
<p>Greentube stands to benefit from this deal by incorporating this expertise into its own offer, following on a number of similar integrations of late. The company acquired a 65% stake in Alteatec recently, and it now participates in Flamingocatz, an up-and-coming studio and developer of iGaming content with an exclusive focus on the North American market.</p>
<p>Previously, Greentube also acquired Present Creative, another prominent US-based studio dedicated to building strong and distinguishable iLottery and iGaming products. Greentube has been able to leverage its strong momentum from previous years to quickly boost its production capacity and ensure that it snaps up assets that contribute to the company’s further expansion moves in global markets.</p>
<p>Greentube also announced the Greentube Mynt solution designed to significantly boost the company’s capabilities in producing and delivering new products, all of which are brought forward with the help of a Remote Gaming Server. Commenting on the latest partnership, Greentube CFO/CGO Michael Bauer said:</p>
<p>This acquisition is a fantastic one as we continue to bolster our technology platform in what will be a very big year for us strategically. Ineor has been a highly valued partner for a number of years and it’s great to be able to harness its resources in-house. Greentube CFO/CGO Michael Bauer</p>
<p>Challenging Ineor to Be Better</p>
<p>Ineor founder Dejan Spasovski was equally thrilled to see his company become a member of the Greentube and NOVOMATIC’s family. The companies have already worked together, and Spasovski said that Ineor has been able to grow as a global software expert thanks to the constant challenges that its new owner laid out for it over the years.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have become a part of the Greentube family through this acquisition,” Spasovski added and said that the partnership will be a mutually-beneficial one.</p>
