<p>Betsson Group is looking to strengthen its exposure and operations in the vibrant esports betting market through a new tie-up with an established leader in the vertical. This is where Sports Information Services or SIS for short comes in.</p>
<p>The company provides multi-channel live betting services, including competitive video gaming. Betsson will be able to tap into SIS’ esports betting product, and specifically, Competitive Gaming, which will offer end-to-end solutions to the company, Casino Guru News learned via an email press release.</p>
<p>SIS has a reputation for delivering superior margins in real-time, which allows companies that are determined to strengthen their position in esports to do so quickly and easily. Competitive Gaming is a product that has already been adopted by several rivals, including Spreadex and bet365 and is likely to continue making waves across the industry, as demonstrated by Betsson Group’s choice to go after this solution as well.</p>
<p>Commenting on the opportunity, SIS Commercial Manager for UK and Europe Dave Richardson said that the company was delighted to see its esports betting product roll out with more trusted brands whose customers are interested in the vertical and want the best possible service.</p>
<p>"SIS Competitive Gaming continues to attract interest from operators worldwide, with our end-to-end solution seen as a compelling option to elevate the esports betting experience. We’re looking forward to working alongside the Betsson team to maximise the potential of this ever-growing vertical," Richardson said confidently, highlighting the product value of Competitive Gaming and SIS’ overall position in the market.</p>
<p>Competitive Gaming is a highly trusted and respected product which is overseen by staff who have undergone training and certification with the Esports Integrity Commission. SIS has been a leader in the provision of esports betting solutions for operators that want to expand in this vertical.</p>
<p>In December, the company teamed up with bet365 to offer esports betting products and markets in New Jersey, United States. Meanwhile, esports betting has been expanding globally as a vertical. In North America, there have been tentative attempts to introduce the vertical in a more permanent position, especially since the pandemic when states such as Nevada allowed betting on esports on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>Operators have been keen to increase their presence in the segment. Stake, a prominent betting and gaming company, teamed up with Oddin.gg, a supplier of betting odds and solutions, in May.</p>
