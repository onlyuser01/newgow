<p>Dear Nick,</p>
<p>Guiseppebrassotti97 was detected of having multiple accounts. According to the Casino’s Terms and Conditions a player can only open one account on the Website, additional accounts are being closed:</p>
<p>"3.10. The customer’s account must be registered on his/her own, personal, and correct, name and personal details. The customer must ensure that all data given at the registration stage is true, complete, and free from error. Registration is allowed only once per person, family, household address, email address, payment account number, site cookies, IP address, and shared computer, i.e. Public library or workplace and cannot share any of the aforementioned with a previously registered account. This therefore also means that the customer has to register personally. Furthermore, a customer can only have one account. Any other accounts which a customer opens with the company, or which are beneficially owned by the customer shall be considered duplicate accounts. 1BET shall close any duplicate account/s consequent to the identification of the main account. If 1BET closes a duplicate account all bonuses, free bets, and winnings acquired using that duplicate account will be void and forfeited. If the amount in the duplicate account does not cover the amount to be refunded to 1BET, 1BET shall seek to recover the loss incurred directly from any other of your accounts.</p>
<p>3.11. A duplicate account is considered as such in any case where the account IP address, Personal details, payment account number, and site cookies match with an already existing account with the company."</p>
<p>Full T&amp;C: https://1bet.com/pages/terms-and-conditions</p>
<p>The player was informed by our Support team about this issue, and everything was explained in detail – why the account was closed, and winnings voided. During the conversation, the player even confirms the existence of another account. The personal details in both accounts are mostly the same.</p>
<p>We hope this will clear up the situation.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>1Bet Casino</p>
