<p>Blizzard fans can start prepping for this year’s edition of Blizzcon which will be taking place in November, with tickets going on sale in May.</p>
<p>BlizzCon Comes back to Anaheim Convention Center</p>
<p>For yet another year, Blizzard’s fan festival will be held at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 1 and November 2. BlizzCon 2019 will feature a number of attractions and activities, along with the well-known developer panels, esports competitions, and other community highlights.</p>
<p>BlizzCon will be setting a pre-launch event that will have gamers gather around the convention center and mingle ahead of the actual grand opening. Looking to inspire attendees and offer an unforgettable experience, Blizzard will be offering not only the traditional BlizzCon Portal Pass but also a separate ticket that grants admittance to the Darkmoon Faire.</p>
<p>The Darkmoon ticket will let you be among the first to enter the event on both Friday and Saturday as well as grant you a dedicated parking space. If you don’t care about the extra amenities, you can opt for a regular BlizzCon Pass, which will similarly allow you to check out the BlizzCon Pregame Festivities.</p>
<p>There will be a BlizzCon Benefit Dinner which will donate the proceedings to CHOC Children’s, the best children medical facility in the United States. If you are eager to make sure that you can attend the event in person, consider participating in the upcoming ticket sales:</p>
<p>BlizzCon Ticket Sale #1: Saturday, May 4 – 10 a.m. PDT</p>
<p>BlizzCon Ticket Sale #2: Wednesday, May 8 – 7 p.m. PDT</p>
<p>You will be granted in-game goodies as well as an awesome commemorative Human Footman or Orc Grunt figurine, marking the 25th anniversary of Warcraft. The figures represent 25 years of conflict and camaraderie, but mostly conflict Blizzard noted on their page.</p>
<p>You will need to decide what statue you want at the time you purchase the ticket, though, as Blizzard will be placing a bulk order to produce all statues ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Blizzard Entertainment president J. Allen Brack had the following to say, commenting on the upcoming event:</p>
<p>“BlizzCon has served as a home away from home for the Blizzard community, a place where online friends can meet up in real life and new friendships are formed,” “We’re looking forward to welcoming everyone to the show this year, reconnecting, celebrating, and sharing some of our latest developments.”</p>
<p>This sums up the known information about Blizzard’s current plans for BlizzCon 2019. More details will be announced at a later date. Last year, we got multiple new developments, including the announcement of Diablo: Immortal and Warcraft III Reforged.</p>
<p>BlizzCon 2018 also confirmed that World of Warcraft Classic is coming this summer, which is big news for the majority of us who are very much nostalgic about the olden days.</p>
