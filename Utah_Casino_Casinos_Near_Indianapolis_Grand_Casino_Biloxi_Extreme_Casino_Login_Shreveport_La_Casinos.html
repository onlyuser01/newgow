<p>B2B provider of gaming content, technology, hardware and services Inspired Entertainment announced a new exclusive agreement with Flutter Entertainment-owned brand Paddy Power.</p>
<p>Managed Services, VLT Cabinets</p>
<p>The agreement between Inspired Entertainment and the brand operating over 350 betting shops in the UK will see the tech solutions supplier provide Paddy Power with fully integrated managed services covering its entire UK estate, installing approximately 1,400 terminals and providing remote and field tech support, content and platform deployment.</p>
<p>Vince Bateson, head of Retail Gaming at Paddy Power, hailed the excellent partnership Paddy Power had developed over many years with Inspired Entertainment.</p>
<p>Our customers know and trust Inspired’s product and we’re delighted to be able to enhance our offering with the very latest terminal and the very best technology. Vince Bateson, head of Retail Gaming at Paddy Power</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Paddy Power will procure approximately 1,400 Vantage server-based gaming-ready cabinets by the end of 2023. Powered by an intelligent operating system, the cabinets of the Inspired VLT family feature functionalities that make players recommend the games to others.</p>
<p>“Inspired’s Vantage terminal has performed exceptionally well in our trials and is a perfect fit with our strategic goal of providing our customers with the best possible experience in our retail shops,” Bateson concluded.</p>
<p>For Inspired Entertainment, president and chief operating officer Brooks Pierce hailed Paddy Power for its “exceptional job” in operating the high street betting shops in the UK, “thrilled to partner with such a premier provider.”</p>
<p>Mutually Beneficial Agreement</p>
<p>As for the agreement, Pierce believes that it would be mutually beneficial, helping Paddy Power improve its product offering and drive growth in revenue alongside a reduction of operational costs while serving as “a prime example” of Inspired Entertainment’s UK transformation, where the business is shifting from “hardware-centric capital-intensive business model” to an asset-light one based on “managed services, content and platform.”</p>
<p>The agreement with Paddy Power is the latest between Inspired Entertainment and a UK-based operator involving the procurement of new gaming machines, following the deal with Betfred last month.</p>
<p>Under the five-year deal, Inspired Entertainment agreed to install 5,000 of its Vantage cabinets from the VLT family at Betfred’s UK estate of 1,400 betting shops. The deal also included remote and field tech support, as well as platform and content deployment.</p>
<p>On the gaming content front, Inspired Entertainment released three new holiday-themed games, Santa LinKing, Santa’s Winning Wishlist and Big Santa Fortune, to expand its gaming portfolio ahead of the end-of-year festive period.</p>
