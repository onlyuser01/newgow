The overall revenue generated by the state’s gaming industry reached a significant total of $467 million for the month, marking a 6% increase compared to the previous month and an 8.8% rise from July 2022.</p>

<p>The revenue boost contributed significantly to state and local governments, amassing a total of $192 million in tax revenue for July. The online casino sector was a major driver of the revenue growth, with operators collectively raking in $132.9 million from players. While this figure indicated a slight 1.8% dip from June, it reflected an impressive 34.8% increase when compared to July 2022.</p>
<p>Among the standout performers in the online casino sector was Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, which claimed $54.4 million in combined earnings.

<p>However, in the realm of brick-and-mortar casinos, the data highlighted a relatively stagnant in-person visitation trend despite an increase in the number of venues over the year. The 17 operational casinos reported $214.7 million in slots revenue for July, a marginal difference from the previous year’s 16-casino figure. Table games revenue totaled $83.4 million, a $3 million decrease from July 2022.</p>

<p>Parx Casino maintained its position as the leader in slots revenue with $33.3 million, albeit a 1% decrease from July 2022. Meanwhile, Wind Creek Bethlehem retained its status as the favored destination for table games, generating $23.7 million, just under 1% higher than the previous July’s level. Aside from the great performance of the sector, the PGCB has been slamming casinos in the state with hefty fines due to regulatory breaches, including underage gambling and inadequate supervision of children.</p>
