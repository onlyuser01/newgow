<p>IGT, a global leader in gaming technology, is set to revolutionize the California Lottery’s operations with its cutting-edge cloud-based solutions, as announced on October 12, 2023</p>
<p>The California Lottery has solidified its collaboration with International Game Technology PLC (IGT), securing a seven-year extension that promises to reshape the future landscape of the state’s lottery experience.</p>
<p>California Lottery Chooses IGT’s OMNIA™ Lottery Solution for Unmatched Gaming</p>
<p>Under the freshly-inked contract, IGT’s subsidiary, IGT Global Solutions Corporation, will be the primary technology provider for the California Lottery, marking a continuation of their fruitful partnership. This agreement allows for a potential extension until 2033, with the option of five additional one-year renewals.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this collaboration is the adoption of IGT’s innovative cloud-based platform, seamlessly integrated into its OMNIA™ lottery solution. This move replaces the existing second-chance platform and extends to the migration of the lottery’s operational management tools and applications into the cloud. By doing so, the California Lottery aims to enhance flexibility, and reliability, and accelerate innovation, ultimately offering players an unparalleled gaming experience.</p>
<p>Jay Gendron, IGT chief operating officer, Global Lottery, highlighted: “IGT’s enhanced second-chance promotions platform will provide maximum flexibility for the California Lottery to create a variety of exciting promotional drawings and bonus capabilities for its players.”</p>
<p>He further expressed the company’s commitment to driving increased sales for the California Lottery, ultimately supporting the state’s public schools.</p>
<p>IGT Will Keep Providing Uninterrupted Comprehensive Services</p>
<p>Beyond the technological upgrades, IGT will continue to provide comprehensive services to the California Lottery. This includes supporting and maintaining the central system, communications network, and managing over 140,000 point-of-sale hardware across 23,000 retailer locations.</p>
<p>Additionally, IGT will offer instant-ticket games and services, field services, marketing, research capabilities, and call center support, ensuring a seamless gaming experience for players statewide.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking partnership reaffirms IGT’s position as a global leader, serving 25 lotteries in the US, eight of the world’s largest lotteries, and 16 of the world’s top 25 lotteries. The collaboration between IGT and the California Lottery promises a future where technology meets entertainment, setting the stage for an exciting era in the state’s gaming industry.</p>
<p>Another major expansion in the US came with IGT securing an eight-year contract with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC) to provide its iLottery gaming system and related components. The deal allowed CLC to offer online Keno and draw-based lottery games for the first time, including popular games like Lotto!, Cash5, Play3 with Wild Ball, and Play4 with Wild Ball.</p>
