    <h1>Fontainebleau Las Vegas Casino Doubledown Casino Free Codes Outfits Casino Play For Real Money Casin</h1>

<p>It's about this casino being unfair to everything. I deposit 800 euros) first 300 and then 500). I have won 1300 and I make a withdrawal of 1000. After 5 hours they send me an email saying that it cannot be withdrawn since you have to bet 5 times the deposit, it means that I deposit 300 and I lose them, then I deposit 500 and it turns out that to withdraw you have to bet the 300 lost plus the 500 deposited later, which makes a total of 800 x 5 times.....total 4000.</p>
<p>That is to say, you have to bet 4000 euros to be able to withdraw, which is a real one.</p>
<p>I believe, and forgive me for saying so, that you are making a mistake with many casinos: the good ones for you are bad and the bad ones turn out to be good.</p>
<p>There are quite a few that you indicate that they admit players from Spain and it turns out that they don't, but vice versa there are also some.</p>
<p>There are also casinos, and I already told you, that are the same group, but they do not appear as such in your system.</p>
<p>For example: Ybet is the brother of Macau and you have already put it but there are also several more casinos, such as France casino, Vegas kasino, and others that are also from the same group and you do not have it reflected.</p>
<p>I am sorry to tell you this but if you consider that you are the best platform in the world, I think you are wrong because you make serious mistakes.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
