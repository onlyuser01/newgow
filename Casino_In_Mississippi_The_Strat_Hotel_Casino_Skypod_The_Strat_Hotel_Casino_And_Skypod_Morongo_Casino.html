<p>International sports and entertainment technology provider for online gaming markets FansUnite Entertainment Inc has received an important license from the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). The AGCO license will allow FansUnite to turn into a fully-registered sports betting and iGaming supplier in Ontario, as the market prepares to welcome private operators early in April.</p>
<p>AGCO License to Become Effective Starting April 4</p>
<p>Starting April 4, the AGCO license will enable FansUnite to provide its advanced sports betting solutions to all Ontario operators that have received the approval of the AGCO. Chief executive officer for FansUnite Scott Burton expressed the company’s excitement upon receiving the license that would allow it to scale its operations and operate as a supplier of iGaming products and sports betting solutions within the province.</p>
<p>Ontario is deemed one of the most promising gambling markets in North America. According to H2 Gambling Capital, Ontario should yield $2 billion worth of revenue across iGaming and sports betting, bolstered by the private business involvement that will begin early next month.</p>
<p>FansUnite is focused on both domestic growth and global expansion. The new license will allow it to cater to the needs of fresh casinos online and sportsbooks eager to penetrate the Canadian iGaming market.</p>
<p>The market will launch with the help of AGCO’s subsidiary, Gaming Ontario, The AGCO already gave the green light to PointsBet and theScore Bet and allowed them to officially launch their services on the big market launch day. Other companies to have shown interest in the market include Bragg Gaming, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, and PokerStars to name a few.</p>
<p>Last September, the AGCO released the final draft for the online gaming and sports betting legislation, thus fixing a series of past ambiguities regarding integrity and advertisement. While some skeptics have been cautious about letting too many private companies into the province, most industry observers have agreed that this would lead to a high overall gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>What Should Canadians Expect From FansUnite’s Services</p>
<p>FansUnite is currently running a full-service iGaming platform focused on esports and sports that address the needs of the next generation of virtual players and bettors. The platform displays a rich variety of betting options including in-play and pre-match bets while operating several business-to-consumer and business-to-business virtual gaming software solutions.</p>
<p>Canadians who choose any of the AGCO-certified operators powered by the now licensed FansUnite supplier will benefit from all company software advantages. Among them are top-tier fixed and pari-mutuel odds, in-stream and live betting solutions, and industry news.</p>
