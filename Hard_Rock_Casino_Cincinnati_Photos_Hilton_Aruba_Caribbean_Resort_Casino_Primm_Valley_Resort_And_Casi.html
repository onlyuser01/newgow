    <h1>Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati Photos Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort Casino Primm Valley Resort And Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Aschebersch,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. I am afraid, there is nothing we can do for you in this case. The casino proceeded correctly by returning your deposit. If you have an active self-exclusion (in this or sister casino) and you manage to register, the casino must return everything into its previous state – in this case, the casino returned your deposit.</p>
<p>Casinos use this as a protection, so players cannot take advantage of their self-exclusion – when they lose, they ask for a deposit refund, and when they win, they try to withdraw their winnings.</p>
<p>I completely understand, that you would prefer, if you couldn’t register at all in sister casinos. However, casinos often cannot enforce in on software level, and self-excluded players are detected at the point of withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize I couldn’t be more of a help, but the casino proceeded correctly. If there is anything else, I could do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me, otherwise I will be forced to reject this case. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
