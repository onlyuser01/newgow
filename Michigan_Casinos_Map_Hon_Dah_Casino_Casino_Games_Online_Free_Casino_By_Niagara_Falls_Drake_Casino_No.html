    <h1>Michigan Casinos Map Hon Dah Casino Casino Games Online Free Casino By Niagara Falls Drake Casino No</h1>

<p>Kindred Group, one of the largest gambling companies in the world consisting of multiple successful online gambling brands, will raise awareness about its safer gambling initiative called “Journey towards Zero,” thanks to a new shirt sponsorship deal with the Rangers FC, a leading Scottish professional soccer club that competes in the Scottish Premiership.</p>
<p>Judging by details regarding the new collaboration released Wednesday, Kindred’s brand Unibet will take a prominent spot at the Rangers’ home kits. The brand, as well as the slogan “Zero % Mission,” reminding of Kindred’s responsible gambling initiative, will be positioned on the front of the shirts of the players. Unibet and Zero % Mission take the spot that used to be occupied by the 32Red brand. The collaboration, Kindred confirmed, applies for the 2023-24 season and seeks to further raise awareness of the company’s initiative.</p>
<p>Journey towards Zero is an initiative announced by the company a few years ago. Ultimately, the safer gambling initiative seeks to completely eliminate the revenue generated from problem or at-risk gambling. Within this area, Kindred is an absolute pioneer and leads by example, given that no other company within the gambling vertical has implemented such a program. The company tracks its progress quarter by quarter and implements a proactive approach to limit its revenue from problem gambling with an ultimate goal to reach zero.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement to Kindred</p>
<p>James Bisgrove, the incoming chief executive of the Rangers, explained that the team is delighted to join forces with Kindred for the new initiative. He added:” As we look forward to the new season with today’s kit launch, we’re excited to continue the work we’ve done with our valued, principal sponsor, and to highlight ways in which people can gamble responsibly and safely.”</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Kindred has been incredibly successful, as underlined by the longevity of our deal.“ James Bigrove, incoming chief executive of the Rangers FC</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kindred’s general manager UK, Neil Banbury, was similarly delighted about the collaboration and explained that the company remains committed to innovation and transparency. According to him, by leveraging such approaches, Kindred can ensure that its platforms provide the safest form of gambling entertainment.</p>
<p>“We’re proud of our work with Rangers over the last decade and we’re looking forward to continuing that in the season ahead.“ Neil Banbury, general manager UK at Kindred Group</p>
<p>Additionally, Banbury spoke about Kindred’s successful collaboration with the Rangers over the last 10 years. Focusing on the latest deal, he said that the company is excited to see the success the new collaboration will bring. Finally, Banbury noted that the company continues to develop its systems and technology, which in turn, complements its Journey towards Zero initiative.</p>
