<p>The warnings follow the Netherlands’ gambling ads ban which came into effect on July 1 this year</p>
<p>The Dutch gaming regulator, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), has issued stern warnings to several gambling operators for flouting the country’s recent restrictions on untargeted gambling advertisements in August.</p>
<p>KSA Issues Warnings Instead of Fines for Gambling Ad Violations</p>
<p>The crackdown came in response to multiple reports received by the KSA, revealing that various online gambling providers were still displaying advertisements on public billboards and bus shelters in violation of the new regulations.</p>
<p>Rather than immediately imposing fines, the KSA had initially informed these operators about the updated advertising guidelines, urging them not to push the boundaries of the law. It was made clear that any blatant infringements would result in enforcement actions. Once alerted to the violations, the KSA promptly contacted the concerned gambling providers. Following their prompt and cooperative responses, the regulator decided to issue warnings instead of pursuing penalties.</p>
<p>The affected advertisements ceased to appear following the KSA’s interventions, thus resolving the issue without the need for fines.</p>
<p>As the Dutch authorities continue to enforce these advertising restrictions, the KSA remains vigilant, aiming to create a gambling environment that safeguards vulnerable individuals and upholds the new rules governing untargeted gambling advertisements in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>KSA Introduced Rigorous Rules for Dutch Gambling Ads</p>
<p>The Dutch ban on untargeted gambling advertisements stipulates that such promotions are not permitted in public spaces or areas accessible to the public. This restriction extends to billboards, bus shelters, cinemas, arcades, and casinos. Furthermore, advertising on television and radio is strictly prohibited under the new regulations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the rules do allow gambling operators to advertise under rigorous conditions via various platforms, including the Internet, direct mail, and social media. However, these advertisements must adhere to strict age-related targeting requirements, with the goal of reaching an audience where at least 95% of viewers are over the age of 24. Sponsorships are also affected, with transitional periods for existing contracts.</p>
<p>Prior to the ban’s implementation, the KSA had adopted a somewhat hands-off approach, preferring to provide limited guidance and encouraging operators to take the lead in complying with the new rules. In anticipation of the ban, the Dutch gambling industry had also created a new set of self-regulation guidelines, known as the advertising code for online games of chance, to align their practices with the impending regulations.</p>
<p>Rene Jansen, Chairman of the Netherlands Gambling Authority (KSA), discussed upcoming changes in gambling regulation at a gaming conference in June. He emphasized the importance of data vault systems (CDBs) for Anti-Money Laundering compliance and highlighted that the new advertising regulations allow land-based operators to continue advertising their land-based offerings but, if they are also operational online, their ads must be notably different from online ads.</p>
