    <h1>Casino Resorts In Oklahoma Barona Casino Buffet Oceans Casino Ac Casino Orlando Admiral Casino Games</h1>

<p>Again,</p>
<p>I want my purchase history from you showing the total amount of charges. The transactions were made on November 26th and November 27th of 2020.</p>
<p>I was charged 73 times at 29.99, for a total of 2189.27 $ by Triton. I was only credited about 1680$ on your site. I sent an email to your representative Tom at support@spin247.com on the 24th of February with my phone bill and the Triton transactions displaying the exact time and date of these purchases. The phone bill displays all transactions in MST ( MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME ) and the Triton transactions are timed in EST (EASTERN STANDARD TIME ). There is a total, again, of 73 purchases. You can see on my phone bill on the third page under usage charges it will say application purchases and show the total which is 2189.27 $. All transactions are shown on page 5 through to page 7. I have sent these documents for the second time now.</p>
<p>I want to be refunded the difference. Your representative that night misinformed me of these transactions stating that if I had not used the verification code (which allows me the funds to be deposited on your site) provided by the automated service (Triton) then the charges would be voided. They were not voided. All of this happened on November 26 2020 starting at 21:16 MST and 23:16 EST ending on November 27, 2020 at 04:24MST or 06:24 EST.</p>
<p>2189.27 CAD - 1679.44 CAD = 509.83$CAD</p>
<p>509.83 $ CAD is the amount I am getting from you, I also am requesting my purchase history from you for that time frame November 26th and November 27th of 2020</p>
<p>The email was sent to support@spin247.com at 15:05 MST on the 11th of March 2021</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Michael B****</p>
