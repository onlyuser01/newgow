    <h1>Free Casino Slot Machine Games Casino Hollywood Florida Modo Us Casino Cherokee Casino Resort Plaza</h1>

<p>Supplier of global gaming solutions EveryMatrix announced today it officially launched into the online Mexican regulated market via Foliatti Group.</p>
<p>Online Brand with Huge Potential</p>
<p>Foliatti Casino, the first online venture of Foliatti Group, officially launched operations in Mexico after closely working with EveryMatrix. Foliatti Group, which has a significant land-based gaming presence across several Mexican states, teamed with the B2B gaming solutions provider earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, EveryMatrix CCO and co-founder Stian Hornsletten expressed the company’s pride at the launch of the new online gaming brand Foliatti Casino, stressing the enormous amount of resources everyone at EveryMatrix “poured” into the project.</p>
<p>“As a platform provider, EveryMatrix is happy to offer its turnkey solution to leading land-based brands looking to have a great start in the online sphere. It has been a great pleasure to work with Mad Men and Foliatti Group, and I see a great future ahead of us.” Stian Hornsletten, CCO &amp; Co-Founder, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Following the official launch, online casino players in the country can now enjoy a variety of casino games, sports and esports betting offerings, as well as rich and exciting promotions, supported by EveryMatrix’s flexible turnkey solution, including its recently launched Managed Services unit.</p>
<p>Bespoke iGaming Solutions</p>
<p>In preparations for the launch and to further differentiate Foliatti Casino’s offering on the market, EveryMatrix had teamed with front-end specialists Mad Men to utilize its expertise in terms of market knowledge, best UX practices and practical tools and ensure the online casino brand starts with an identity of its own and attractive website design.</p>
<p>“Our past work experience with EveryMatrix’s team made this project a pleasure. Thanks to our fast interactions, we were able to deliver the project quickly, so Foliatti can start running their new online brand right away. That being said, we’re looking forward to partnering and working with EveryMatrix again for future projects.” Michel Groenendijk, Director, Mad Men</p>
<p>Provider of bespoke iGaming solutions Mad Men, an EveryMatrix certified Gold Partner, collaborated with EveryMatrix within its eco-system to ensure Foliatti Casino offers a fully functional all-native platform and is well equipped not only to go live but also moving forward.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, EveryMatrix released its interim report for the first nine months of 2021, revealing strong top-line growth driven by the winning of several new key customers in regulated markets and further improvements of the company’s comprehensive product. EveryMatrix posted a 43% increase in gross profit and a 12% increase in EBITDA year-over-year.</p>
