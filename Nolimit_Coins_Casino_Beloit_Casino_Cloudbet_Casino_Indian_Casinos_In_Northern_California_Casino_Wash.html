    <h1>Nolimit Coins Casino Beloit Casino Cloudbet Casino Indian Casinos In Northern California Casino Wash</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was playing in royal jeet casino since from more than 2 years and i have deposited more than 2 croce rupees in this site till now. Recently before a month ago i have deposited 2,76,000 Rupees and Made winning amount of total 5,86,680/- Rupees.</p>
<p>When i asked for withdrawal they said that its in verification and need kyc documets to process the withdrawal and when i submitted the documents they said in beginning in few days your withdrawal will be credited in bank account.</p>
<p>But recently when i asked them after waiting for a month for the withdrawal strongly they are saying sorry withdrawal cant be processed as you are breached our terms and conditions i.e participated in cross betting and blaming the customer without showing proper proof who is playing on there site from 2 years plus with big deposits.</p>
<p>In beginning they said kyc pending and dragged for many days now when i asked them strictly for the withdrawal they saying this and will never process the withdrawal to me. You can do what ever you wish rashly.</p>
<p>I request to all Royal jeet Players that to stop playing in this site as they will do same after you win regularly. They will hold the withdrawal with out showing any proofs. To a vip player they did like these don't know about new or recent players how they will scam you people too.</p>
<p>Finally before complaining to ED Income Tax Department to hold funds of deposited manual bank accounts of royaljeet.com by placing FIR In Cyber Crime.</p>
<p>I seen few recent queries which solved by casino guru team in royaljeet.com. I too wish same my query will also solved here by casino guru only you can do justice for my concern and get my withdrawal back to my bank account without Police or ED Complaint.</p>
<p>Thanks for doing needful.</p>
