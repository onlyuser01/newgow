    <h1>What States Have Casinos Dubuque Iowa Casinos Rising Sun Casino Casinos In Mississippi Casino Reno N</h1>

<p>The prominent operator of iGaming, sports, and poker products has teamed up with the World Series of Poker</p>
<p>The partnership will see OlyBet Group become the official partner for the upcoming WSOP Tallinn which will be held from September 14 through September 24, 2023, at the Olympic Park Casino and Hilton Hotel. This is the first time that the World Series of Poker has headed into Northern Europe, creating a new, exciting, and important stop on its busy calendar.</p>
<p>WSOP Heads into Northern Europe for Very First Time</p>
<p>The series will be conducted in collaboration with WSOP, GGPoker, and OlyBet Group. Commenting on this new opportunity, WSOP VP Gregory Chochon welcomed this fresh opportunity to see the event take place well beyond its home stomping ground in Las Vegas. This way, other poker communities can too join the global push for finding the best player. Chochon added:</p>
<p>That growth is continuing into Northern Europe and we are delighted to partner with OlyBet to bring the excitement and passion of the WSOP Circuit Series to Estonia for the first time in circuit history. WSOP VP Gregory Chochon</p>
<p>The WSOP Main Event in Tallinn will also feature a €1 million prize pool guarantee, and there will be a total of 12 WSOP ring events in the Estonian capital.</p>
<p>Olympic Entertainment Group CEO Corey Plummer was similarly happy to welcome this new opportunity to Northern Europe and see Tallinn turn into a hot spot for some of the region’s best poker players.</p>
<p>Exciting Opportunity for Players in the Region</p>
<p>Plummer was excited to welcome the pivotal organization and its legacy to Northern Europe and argued that OlyBet was in a particularly strong position to host all sorts of poker events.</p>
<p>We are already hosting the largest poker festival in Northern Europe with the Kings of Tallinn, and we expect to go further with the excitement and thrills of having this WSOP Circuit event with the 12 rings and 1 million Euros guaranteed main event. Olympic Entertainment Group CEO Corey Plummer</p>
<p>Tallinn is naturally just one of the many stops at the event. GGPoker has already announced the Road to London which will further feed into the WSOP Main Event in the United States.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to qualify for the upcoming Tallinn event, you may try joining the OlyBet or GGPoker Network satellite events, which could help you get a cheaper entry into the upcoming Northern Europe WSOP tournament.</p>
