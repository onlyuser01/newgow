    <h1>Clams Casino Georgia Casino Doubledown Casino Free Slots Codes Good Casinos In California Riverside</h1>

<p>On May 7, 2023, I requested to have a 3 month cool off period via email through my VIP manager Angela. Instead of 3 months, it was only 3 days. I found myself making deposits again and contacted live chat on May 11 to self exclude due to spending too much/problem gambling. I was told to contact Angela, which I did, on May 11. This request was ignored. I emailed again May 23, and May 26. The tactic used appeared to be to respond to my requests with questions to not actually action the request.</p>
<p>I ended up depositing over $11,000 during this time. I withdrew $4500. I am concerned that this casino is not following the responsible gambling guidelines and clearly stalls and delays responding to self exclude and cool off.</p>
<p>My account has since been closed (May 27), but I don't think I should have to contact chat to be referred to the Vip manager, then have to email 3 times to request self exclusion. I clearly noted the reason for wanting to cool off and self exclude.</p>
<p>To be transparent, I filed a complaint with Ask Gamblers already - the site simply didn't respond to the complaint inquiry. Seems like it's worth it for them to ignore self exclusion requests and complaint inquiries.</p>
<p>I have more attachments showing deposits and dates if needed.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
