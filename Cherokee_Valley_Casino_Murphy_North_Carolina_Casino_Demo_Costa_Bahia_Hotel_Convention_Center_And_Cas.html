    <h1>Cherokee Valley Casino Murphy North Carolina Casino Demo Costa Bahia Hotel Convention Center And Cas</h1>

<p>Well, how do I put this. I won and made a withdrawal. The withdrawal was kicked back, I sent in what they needed, and the agent I was working with confirmed everything was a go. Four days later, nothing. I went back into the casino, and contacted a live agent, who passed me to another agent, and then another pass, and yet again one more pass - by this time, I wasn't in a good mood.</p>
<p>Fourth agent says I seem to want this withdrawal urgently, I said that was not the issue, the issue is it's been 4 days and I haven't gotten a confirmation on this withdrawal via email which always happens before the funds are e-transfered to the bank account, and at this point, I had waited over the weekend, plus the three days, which felt like eternity of course.</p>
<p>The agent then told me that my words had "raised a flag", and that they would be closing my account immediately. The blood drained from my face, of course, as I realized that they were literally closing me out and I had a pending withdrawal, which seemed to go through just fine with the agent that helped with it days earlier... Could this be happening??? Needless to say, I was somewhat in shock - I was getting a vibe that they were grasping at anything to NOT release my money, and their reason was absurd. Apparently, because I had asked why my funds weren't processed yet and that perhaps one could USE the money sooner than later and that this was taking far too long considering the agent that helped me with the withdrawal seemed to have no issues, was congratulating me and so on... at this point, I was FURIOUS. I asked for a manager to contact me, asap. And that I would be more than happy to close the account AFTER my withdrawal was done. The agent agreed that that was what would happen. And that I would get my funds.</p>
<p>Two days later, I get a phone call from "the manager". This person, later in the conversation and AFTER telling me she was a manager, accidentally admitted she was not in fact a manager. WHAT THE HECK! She spoke very rudely, she was condescending and if I may add not overly well-spoken. She was VERY combative, and frankly had no idea what she was talking about, I could tell as I listened to this person babble on about things that had nothing to do with this situation. She then told me that I would NOT be receiving my funds. My blood, at this point, was BOILING OVER. I had not done anything extreme, or wasn't being difficult - Plain and simple, I was being gaslighted by the casino. It seemed (to me) that they simply didn't want to part with their $800.</p>
<p>I asked for her name and employee ID, and said I was going to contact the iGaming commission about this as there was absolutely NO reason to go to these lengths, etc... In the end, and after speaking to many other agents/managers/who knows what they were, I did get my funds, but, I happily closed the account after only 1 time having played there.</p>
<p>It was a terrible experience. It clearly seemed that Bally Bet was eluding that I had "problem", due to saying "don't you think a person could USE the money sooner than later, I know I certainly can" (I believe those were my actual words) - I reminded them that if you look, I have made one deposit and only ONE, and it was for $20. I had been lucky enough to win, and never go back. Beware folks, this casino definitely had a sketchy vibe. I am grateful for the win, but the stress, the impersonation of being a manager, the unfair treatment and lies... I'll pass.</p>
