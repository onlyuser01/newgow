<p>The national trade group representing the regulated US casino industry, the American Gaming Association (AGA), announced that it expanded its partners within its public service campaign that seeks to raise awareness of responsible gambling, Have A Game Plan, Bet Responsibly. As a result, the responsible gambling campaign was joined by the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).</p>
<p>Becoming Have A Game Plan, Bet Responsibly partner will see the league help educate its fans about responsible gambling. The WNBA will deliver different responsible gambling resources for its 12 teams.</p>
<p>The responsible gambling campaign will engage with the fans via different media channels, including digital, social media, as well as in-person and broadcast activations. In addition, the campaign will include "in-app and website integration into the league's WNBABet tab and content," a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The start of the WNBA season will mark the launch of responsible gaming activations. The League's new season is set to roll out on May 19, 2023. Following the launch of the responsible gaming campaign, it will continue throughout the WNBA's regular season and also cover the playoffs.</p>
<p>It was back in 2019 when AGA's Have A Game Plan campaign first rolled out. Ultimately, the campaign seeks to create a sports betting ecosystem that is powered by an education platform. The campaign has four primary principles encouraging responsible betting.</p>
<p>Those principles include setting a budget and staying within that budget as well as keeping sports betting as a form of social entertainment. Companies that join the initiative also encourage bettors to know the odds whenever they are betting and at the same time use the services of regulated and legal sports betting operators.</p>
<p>Currently, Have A Game Plan has an industry-wide reach. Some of the most popular sports betting operators, as well as sports leagues, have already vowed support for the responsible gambling initiative. DraftKings, FanDuel, Entain and BetMGM are only a few of the leading operators that support AGA's campaign. Additionally, Have A Game Plan is supported by leading sports leagues such as NASCAR, NHL, MLB and popular sports teams like the New York Jets and the New York Rangers, to name a few.</p>
<p>Casey Clark, AGA's Senior Vice President, shared his excitement about the recent addition of the WNBA to the Have A Game Plan initiative. He said: "The WNBA's commitment to Have A Game Plan will expand the campaign's reach to new and existing basketball audiences."</p>
<p>Finally, Clark noted: "As legal sports betting matures across America, reaching the market's broad group of diverse participants will require exactly the kind of leadership the WNBA, NBA and all of our Have A Game Plan partners have shown."</p>
<p>Colie Edison, WNBA's Chief Growth Officer, added: "WNBA fans are always looking for new and exciting ways to immerse themselves in our game, and legal sports betting has opened the door for deeper engagement with our league." Last but not least, Edison explained: "As we explore this new avenue, the WNBA is committed to ensuring those who choose to wager on our league have the knowledge and tools to do so responsibly."</p>
