<p>BetMGM has expanded and strengthened its partnership with NHL franchise Detroit Red Wings, bringing fans the opportunity to tap into odds and fixtures.</p>
<p>Detroit Red Wings and BetMGM Strengthen Partnership</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International and GVC Holdings’ sports betting subsidiary BetMGM has expanded on a strategic partnership with National Hockey League (NHL) franchise Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p>The multi-year partnership allows BetMGM to better new and existing audiences thanks to the in-venue signage and intellectual properties displayed at Little Caesars Arena, the Detroit Red Wings’ home stadium.</p>
<p>Further to that, BetMGM will be available across Red Wings’ digital platforms, helping boost awareness for the sportsbook.</p>
<p>To bring value to fans, BetMGM will enable the BetMGM Stats Module as part of the District Detroit mobile app, giving Detroit loyalists the opportunity to reference betting odds as well as statistics in the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Executives across both sides received the news well. Detroit Red Wings SVP of Corporate Partnerships Peter Kent said that the company was thrilled to be cementing its position with BetMGM.</p>
<p>Kent confirmed that the companies would seek further opportunities to provide “innovative and engaging experiences for the fans of Hockeytown.”</p>
<p>BetMGM Chief Marketing Officer Matt Prevost added that the Red Wings are an iconic part of Michigan and the city of Detroit and that BetMGM and MGM Resorts were both lucky to have them as partners.</p>
<p>“Little Caesars Arena is just steps away from the BetMGM Sports Lounge at MGM Grand Detroit, and as BetMGM continues to build its hockey offerings, we look forward to welcoming Red Wings fans before and after games.”</p>
<p>MGM Resorts president David Tsai said that MGM Grand Detroit was excited for the opportunity to accommodate Red Wings fans in the BetMGM Sports Lounge decked out with state-of-the-art sports betting solutions.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing guests with a fun, world-class experience during hockey season and beyond,” Tsai concluded.</p>
<p>Building Partnerships with Social Responsibility in Mind</p>
<p>In the official press release, BetMGM and MGM Resorts stated that the expansion in the sports betting vertical happened alongside a focus on responsible gambling education.</p>
<p>GameSense, an industry program available MGM Resorts, courtesy of British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC), allows to proactively approach customers and remind them to gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>BetMGM has also spent time training staff members, known as GameSense Advisors, who may assist an individual showing symptoms or signs of gambling distress. The company offers a variety of educational materials and resources available as part of its M life Rewards Desk at physical properties owned by MGM.</p>
<p>BetMGM recently tapped Ryan Spoon as a chief operating officer and the company powered the Yahoo Sportsbook experience. The company also sought out Scientific Games for the latter’s innovative OpenGaming platform.</p>
