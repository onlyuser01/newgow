    <h1>Casino Mania Denver Casinos Ct Casinos Rhythm City Casino Resort Casino Games With Real Money Entain</h1>

<p>Gaming Realms’ CCO said that convergence and licensing partnerships are at the heart of the success of the Slingo genre.</p>
<p>Entain, a global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment company, has announced the launch of a “unique and innovative” multiplayer bingo game. The title is called Slingo Bingo and, under license from Gaming Realms, will be the first of its kind in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The launch of Slingo Bingo follows the success of Entain’s Gala Bingo brand. The latter just recorded a 20% increase in customers in the UK, attesting to its appeal.</p>
<p>Slingo Bingo will reinforce Entain’s commitment to providing British customers with exciting bingo experiences. The thrilling new game is a unique experience developed in-house by Entain. It will be exclusively available to the company’s customers in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Slingo itself is a famous Gaming Realms brand that has proven to have a strong appeal among Entain customers. The developer’s Slingo titles currently account for half of Gala Bingo’s top 10 most popular games, further highlighting Gaming Realms’ understanding of making engaging bingo games.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the new release will pair Gaming Realms’ popular IP with Entain’s in-house expertise in iGaming. The partnership with Gaming Realms follows another major deal for Entain that saw it join forces with Tab NZ.</p>
<p>Convergence Is at the Heart of the Slingo IP’s Success</p>
<p>Spokespeople from the two companies addressed the deal with Satty Bhens, Entain’s chief product officer, noting that bingo is an increasingly popular vertical. According to him, customers that play online bingo are always looking for the best possible experiences. Thanks to Slingo Bingo, Entain will be able to deliver just that.</p>
<p>All our customers in the UK will be excited to see one of their favorite brands brought to life in a bingo variant, with the launch of Slingo Bingo reaffirming Entain as the home of innovation, excitement, and fun. Satty Bhens, CPO, Entain</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gareth Scott, Gaming Realms’ chief commercial officer, said that convergence and licensing partnerships are at the heart of the success of the Slingo genre. In addition, he noted that the partnership with Entain is a milestone moment for him and his company.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for Gaming Realms to introduce Slingo to new audiences and grow brand equity. Gareth Scott, CCO, Gaming Realms</p>
<p>In other news, Entain just introduced major changes to its board, adding two new committees. One of the two committees is the People &amp; Governance Committee which will be led by Stella David. The other new committee is the Sustainability &amp; Compliance Committee which will replace the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and will be led by Virginia McDowell.</p>
