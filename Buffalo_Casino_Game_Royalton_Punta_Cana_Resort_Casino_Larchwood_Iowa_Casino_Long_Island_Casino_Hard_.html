<p>Roc Nation, the service entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z, turned to the people of New York City to promote its bid to build a casino on Times Square.</p>
<p>New Destination Will Benefit Everyone</p>
<p>Roc Nation addressed the public in an open letter on Thursday, seeking to provide details about its bid for a new gaming facility at 1515 Broadway in Times Square that is meant to serve the benefit of New York City.</p>
<p>“A gaming license is going to be awarded to New York City. A bill was passed in the state legislature confirming it. The question is: which applicant will get the license,” the open letter begins, adding that “some conflicted parties have attempted to spread misinformation,” hence the need to address the public directly.</p>
<p>Roc Nation teamed with New York’s largest owner of office properties, SL Green, and casino entertainment company, Caesars Entertainment, at the end of last year to compete for a casino license and build a new tourist destination in the city, Caesars Palace Times Square.</p>
<p>SL Green’s 1515 Broadway office and theater skyscraper will be transformed into an integrated resort featuring a casino, an entertainment venue, shopping outlets, a spa, and a convention and meeting space. The proposal is also supported by a broad coalition of Times Square stakeholders representing labor from construction, restaurants, hotels, small businesses, and theater, as well as local residents.</p>
<p>The winning group must have a track record of turning words into deeds – of putting New York City and its residents first – people of all races, religions, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations and socio-economic statuses. Roc Nation letter excerpt</p>
<p>No Place for Hate and Oppression</p>
<p>Emphasizing that the bid winner should “have a history for fair hiring, representation, and reform,” Roc Nation was also explicitly clear that “hate and groups with a history of oppressing the most vulnerable have no place in New York.”</p>
<p>Determined to ensure that Times Square as an “epicenter of entertainment,” maintains its links “to all facets of culture,” Roc Nation and its partners believe that Times Square is the best location for the new Caesars Palace entertainment destination.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the casino resort will provide billions in tax revenue to New York City and State and will enhance economic activities through strategic partnerships with area businesses.</p>
<p>Estimates show that the venue will generate over 7 million new visits to Times Square annually, resulting in more than 600,000 new overnight visits to local hotels, new over 7 million meals for local restaurants, $166 million in retail spending, and $65 million in new annual Broadway ticket sales.</p>
<p>Roc Nation is adamant that their innovative plan will enhance the lives of everyday New Yorkers by giving back to all surrounding businesses, benefiting mass transits, bringing investments in sanitation and security, delivering a transportation plan, protecting the interests of actors, producers, writers, and staff that are in essence the soul of Broadway, as well as creating opportunities for all.</p>
<p>“Our bid honors the city of dreams, New York City, and the people that have made this place we call home the cultural and entertainment capital of the world,” the letter concluded, urging everyone to support their proposal.</p>
