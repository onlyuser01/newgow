    <h1>Planet Hollywood Resort Casino Las Vegas Nv Flandreau Casino Casino Royale 007 Theme Casinos Biloxi</h1>

<p>Good day! I believe the casino 888Starz has violated my rights. In this regard, I am asking you for help.</p>
<p>I list all the important events in chronological order.</p>
<p>21.09.2021 I put $ 600 on the withdrawal. But the money was not credited to my Neteller wallet.</p>
<p>On September 23, 2021, the casino justified the non-crediting by the arisen technical problems on the side of the Neteller payment system.</p>
<p>On September 28, 2021, the casino requested color photos of pages 1, 2, 3, 11 of my passport. The demand was fulfilled on the same day.</p>
<p>09/29/2021 The casino requested screenshots of my Neteller payment wallet. 10/02/2021 I sent screenshots.</p>
<p>On 03.10.2021 the casino informed me that the withdrawal of funds is available to me. But they refused to accept the rates without explaining the reasons. The casino did not send me any messages about the intention to collect a commission from my conclusions.</p>
<p>On 10/04/2021 I put 1155 dollars on the withdrawal. I received only 90% of the withdrawn amount. The casino did not transfer 10% ($ 115.5) to me.</p>
<p>On 10/05/2021 I expected the missing $ 115.5 to be credited, but I never received it.</p>
<p>On 10/06/2021 I sent a claim to the casino.</p>
<p>On 10/08/2021, I received a message from the casino that in special cases, for some gaming accounts of bet participants, the compensation of the commissions of payment systems for depositing and withdrawing funds may be canceled.</p>
<p>On 10.10.2021, I applied to the casino with a request to provide the reasoning part of the decision on the withholding of my funds and explain why the withholding was unilateral and without prior notice.</p>
<p>No answers were given to my questions.</p>
<p>On 10/12/2021, I put the remaining 15 dollars on the withdrawal, but received only 13.5.</p>
<p>Thus, the casino retained $ 117.</p>
<p>I am ready to cooperate, ready to provide correspondence with the casino and any requested documents.</p>
<p>I ask you to help me return my money.</p>
