    <h1>Main Street Station Casino Lucky Eagle Casino Eagle Pass Harrah S Casino Las Vegas The Orleans Hotel</h1>

<p>Wazdan, a provider of innovative online casino titles, has introduced a new addition to its top-performing 9 Coins series. The new game is called 9 Coins: Grand Platinum Edition and will build on the popularity of the series with a selection of exciting features and engaging mechanics.</p>
<p>As announced by the developer, the new game features an increased jackpot. Instead of 500x, players can now win up to 2,500x their bet.</p>
<p>In addition, players can now use the newly-introduced Cash Out mechanic to win cash prizes during the base game. The features will activate when the Cash Out label appears at random and will stick to a reel for up to 15 spins. In case the players draw a bonus symbol before the countdown reaches zero, the Cash Out feature will pay out its assigned reward.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 9 Coins: Grand Platinum Edition features the hit Hold the Jackpot bonus round and the innovative Cash Infinity feature. Both mechanics provide players with new ways to win money. To play for the jackpot, players need to land on a full row of coins. Then, they will be granted respins, which they can use to get their hands on more coins. If they fill all cells with coins, players will win the Grand Jackpot.</p>
<p>The Game Can Be Customized</p>
<p>Gamblers can also customize their experience via the Chance Level and Volatility features. The former can be triggered to multiply the bet but also increase the chances of triggering the bonus round by x2, x2 or x6. The Volatility feature, meanwhile, allows players to pick between low, standard and high volatility.</p>
<p>The new release follows the launch of other games in the 9 Coins series, such as 12 Coins and 8 Coins: Grand Gold Edition. All games in the series allow players to customize their experience, which improves player retention, Wazdan believes.</p>
<p>Wazdan Believes the Game Will Be a Success</p>
<p>Andrzej Hyla, Wazdan’s chief commercial officer, commented on the matter, calling the new release a “captivating addition” to the 9 Coins series. He explained that the game leverages the company’s engagement-building philosophy to deliver a feature-rich experience to fans. Hyla is certain that the new title will drive “fantastic results.”</p>
<p>Striving to create slots that exceed expectations, 9 Coins™: Grand Platinum Edition includes cutting-edge innovations such as the ability to win instant cash prizes at the base game thanks to the Cash Out feature, alongside the new Chance Level mechanic that we know players will love. Andrzej Hyla, CCO, Wazdan</p>
<p>In other news, Wazdan recently inked a new agreement with WWin for Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.</p>
