<p>Bayes Esports and bet365 have expanded their partnership in esports to now cover the Canadian market. The companies believe that they will be able to introduce punters in Ontario to a “new era of sports betting,” albeit the focus will clearly be on competitive video gaming, which is an area in which Bayes Esports is well-versed as it already works with a prominent publisher from the video gaming industry whose titles are some of the most played esports today.</p>
<p>Bet365 and Bayes Esports Building Esports Momentum</p>
<p>This expansion marks the natural continuation of the two companies’ efforts to seek the best possible format for their collaborative efforts. After Bayes Esports became a licensed supplier of odds in New Jersey and Colorado and entered the market with bet365, Ontario is the next natural progression of this expansion.</p>
<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Bayes Esports managing director and COO Amir Mirzaee said that he was very happy to see the company continue to grow its footprint and noted on the most recent expansion in the United States, along with the launch of the innovative odds integration platform, and more. He though definitely praised the most recent expansion in Canada as well:</p>
<p>To now also be registered in Ontario and to extend our partnership with bet365 accordingly feels like the cherry on top. I am certain other provinces will follow Ontario’s example and we will be able to offer live esports data to sportsbooks all across Canada in the near future. Bayes Esports managing director and COO Amir Mirzaee</p>
<p>Ontario is a focal point of sports betting, iGaming and esports betting interest. Rivalry, a local provider of esports betting odds, is one of the most prominent global operators of competitive video gaming markets. Rivalry debuted a Pick’em game for the now completed The International and League of Legends Worlds and is one of the most innovative esports betting operators worldwide.</p>
<p>Bayes Esports is leveraging powerful data directly from at least one publisher presently to bolster media coverage, help operators, and generally contribute to the fast-expanding esports ecosystem. BETER, another company that focuses on developing innovative betting-focused solutions for the esports betting industry, has released an updated iFrame solution. Meanwhile, Nevada is also expecting to make esports betting more readily accessible.</p>
