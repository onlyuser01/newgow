<p>Arsenal started the 2022-23 Premier League season in top gear, beating Crystal Palace 2-0 on the road in Round 1. Leicester City, on the other hand, got themselves only one point at home against Brentford. They did come very close to winning the game, but the Bees scored a late equalizer, setting the final score to 2-2.</p>
<p>They probably feel bad about that game, but they need to pull themselves together by Saturday as that’s when they got a very tough challenge on their hands. They’re playing against favored Arsenal at Emirates Stadium in London.</p>

<p>Arsenal Fans Have Every Right to Feel Optimistic</p>
<p>The Gunners met the expectation in the EPL season opener. They defeated Crystal Palace 2-0 in a game in which they did a wonderful job both in the offense and defense. The Eagles did have their fair share of chances, but Arsenal didn’t let allow them to turn those chances into goals.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that even though there are now five substitutions allowed in the Prem, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta only made three against Crystal Palace. This, however, doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have a strong bench. On the contrary, the Gunners’ roster is packed with young enthusiastic players who would love to leave an impact on the pitch.</p>
<p>This Saturday, however, he might have to go with all five subs as his team is taking on a much tougher opponent.</p>
<p>Leicester City Mustn’t be Underestimated</p>
<p>The Foxes didn’t do great in Round 1, but the odds of +550 on them winning in Round 2 look way too long. After all, they go a really good squad, with a couple of players who were there even during their Premier League-winning season.</p>
<p>They don’t, however, have a great history with Arsenal. In fact, we saw them lose each of their previous three duels with the Gunners, scoring just one goal along the way while allowing seven. When it comes to their performances on Arsenal’s turf, it’s even worse. They’ve won only one game in North London since 1995.</p>
<p>Arsenal vs Leicester City Prediction</p>
<p>In 2022, Arsenal has better players than Leicester. However, Leicester has a much more experienced squad. That said, we could see the Foxes causing trouble to the Gunners this Saturday. They might not necessarily win, but we can see them snatch a point from their trip to the UK capital.</p>
<p>Picks: Arsenal and Leicester City to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
