<p>Derrick Henry, A. J. Brown, Julio Jones and even Ryan Tannehill – with such players on the offense, you’d expect the Tennessee Titans to score 30+ points in every single game. However, they didn’t start the 2021 season that way.</p>
<p>In fact, in Week 1, the Titans lost to the Arizona Cardinals 13-38 at home. In Week 2, they travel to Seattle to take on the Seahawks, and their fans worry the team could go 0-2. Should they be worried? Let’s see!</p>

<p>What Happened to Tennessee’s Offense in Week 1?</p>
<p>Tennessee’s quarterback might not be the best in the NFL, but Tannehill is definitely in the group of elite players. Last season, the guy made 33 touchdown passes, which means something. What it means is that he’s a great passer; it also means that he has great WRs to aim his passes at.</p>
<p>Last season, Brown was Tannehill’s favorite target; this season, he’ll also have Julio Jones ready to catch his throws. Then, there’s also Henry, who’s arguably the best rusher in the league. Evidence of this is the fact that oddsmakers see him as the #1 favorite to be the NFL’s reception leader in 2021.</p>
<p>With such players in the offense, it’s really strange that the Titans scored only 13 points in Week 1. Some fans are blaming the new offensive coordinator, Todd Downing. He got appointed in the offseason after Arthur Smith left for the Atlanta Falcons to become their new head coach.</p>
<p>Can Seahawks Get to 2-0?</p>
<p>Online sportsbooks think so. However, we need to call for caution. The Seahawks did win dominantly in Week 1 against the Colts, but it wasn’t only because they played well. It’s also because Indianapolis players were very bad.</p>
<p>The Colts offensive line was dreadful in that game, letting the Seahawks defense stop Carson Wentz from doing almost anything. The Indianapolis defense was even worse, allowing Seattle’s quarterback to make four touchdown passes.</p>
<p>Russell Wilson was really impressive, as usual. He’s expected to continue playing at the same level or, perhaps, even improve his stats? The reason is that he’ll be facing the Titans, a team whose offense isn’t great. In fact, one could argue that the Colts defense is much better than the one of the Titans.</p>
<p>What all this practically means is that the winner of the Titans vs Seahawks game will be the team that scores more. So, who will outscore who?</p>
<p>It’s going to be close, but the Seahawks should be able to get a win.</p>
<p>Pick: Seahawks to win but probably not to cover the spread. That makes it difficult to expect a high-scoring game, and the Under is likely to hit.</p>
