<p>Overhauling its sportsbook, the company confirmed that users can withdraw their funds by June 30 and explained that customers in Arizona won't be affected</p>
<p>The leading betting and gaming company, Bally’s Corporation, confirmed changes to its Bally Bet mobile sports wagering app. The changes come ahead of a planned transition of the app to a platform offered by the leading business-to-business sports betting platform, technology and services provider, Kambi.</p>
<p>In light of the transition, Bally’s confirmed that users would no longer be able to access their Bally Bet accounts after June 30, 2023. The company explained that the aforementioned change won’t be affecting current customers in Arizona.</p>
<p>However, in other jurisdictions, users can no longer place wagers or deposit funds, effective from Thursday this week, June 22, 203. After June 30, 2023, all of Bally Bets’ accounts would be deactivated and that functionality will likely be restricted. Given the upcoming changes, Bally’s urged its customers to withdraw their funds from their accounts by June 30.</p>
<p>New App to Bring Improved Betting Experiences</p>
<p>Withdrawing the funds is easy and users can simply transfer them to their own account. A request for the withdrawal can be made via the Bally Bet app or the website. Still, if there are customers that fail to transfer their funds, Bally’s confirmed that it will pay out their balance via a check. The betting and gaming company said that there is no minimum amount required for the check and that it will be sent to the addresses players listed on their accounts, ensuring users receive their funds back.</p>
<p>“Simply log in to your Bally Bet account to see if you have any remaining funds to withdraw. You can personally withdraw these until June 30th. Any funds remaining in your account after this date will be mailed to you at the address listed on your account,“ explains a statement via Bally’s</p>
<p>Bally’s explained that there is no need for the customers to deactivate their accounts. Once June 30 comes, the company will automatically deactivate all customer accounts and process the payout of funds for users that have not withdrawn their funds.</p>
<p>“Over the next few months, we will be working hard to elevate your betting experience. We are grateful for your loyalty and look forward to unveiling our enhanced online sportsbook upon our return later this year,“ adds Bally’s</p>
<p>According to Bally’s the temporary halt of Bally Bet comes at a time when the company plans to introduce its new and enhanced online sportsbook. The gaming and betting company pointed out that the return of its overhauled sportsbook is expected later this year but did not confirm a specific date. Still, Bally’s said that it continues to work on its updated sportsbook and vowed to share additional details in due time.</p>
