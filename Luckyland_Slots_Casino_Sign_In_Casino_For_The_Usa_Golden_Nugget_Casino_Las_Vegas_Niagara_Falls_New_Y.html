<p>The deal is a last-gasp attempt to earn more from a betting partner before the EPL's voluntary ban becomes effective</p>
<p>English Premier League (EPL) side Aston Villa FC announced today it has agreed to a three-year partnership with online gambling firm BK8 to make it the club’s new principal and front-of-shirt partner.</p>
<p>Collaborations to Grow Both Brands</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, the logo of the betting and gaming firm will feature on the front of Aston Villa’s three shirts until the end of the 2025/26 season, fitting right into the transitory period EPL clubs gave themselves as part of their voluntary agreement to axe front-of-shirt gambling sponsorships.</p>
<p>“Through this partnership with BK8 we look forward to exciting collaborations together that will help to grow both brands, particularly within Southeast Asia,” said an Aston Villa spokesperson about the deal.</p>
<p>As part of the sponsorship, BK8 committed to making a contribution to a local charity in Birmingham for every adult shirt sold from the club’s third kit, building on the brand’s work with charities and programs aimed at raising mental health awareness over the past two years. The donation is set to become the first in a series of charity initiatives in collaboration with the club.</p>
<p>BK8’s managing director, EMEA, Michael Gatt, explained the rationale behind the initiative, delighted to be in a position to provide support for local charities throughout the partnership with the club.</p>
<p>“Being able to give something back to the supporters for their dedication is a hugely significant part of the reason we want to be involved with a prestigious institution, which is what Aston Villa Football Club are,” he said, highlighting the company’s commitment to supporting local communities of its football partners over the past few years.</p>
<p>Advertising Assets for Charity Messages</p>
<p>Gatt further noted that BK8 would invest in several brand activations over the course of the partnership as a display of their commitment to local charitable initiatives in the city of Birmingham and its surrounding areas and to engage with Villa supporters, as well as give various advertising assets at Villa Park to charity organizations.</p>
<p>Aston Villa has been negotiating with BK8 since the beginning of the year as the club’s current deal with the online car retailer, Cazoo, was set to expire at the end of the season. The club faced strong criticism from its fans after the Aston Villa Fans Consultation Group sent a letter to express its disagreement but decided to ignore the critics and pursue the controversial deal.</p>
<p>BK8 has a history of partnerships with EPL club Crystal Palace, English Football League (EFL) clubs Burnley FC, which has been promoted to the EPL this season, and Huddersfield Town, and a number of Spanish LaLiga clubs, including Villareal CF, Athletic Club Bilbao, Valencia CF, Elche CF, and RCD Mallorca.</p>
<p>The betting brand was involved in a controversy with Norwich City in the summer of 2021 after fans and locals forced the club to scrap the deal with the firm over its use of sexualized adverts online.</p>
