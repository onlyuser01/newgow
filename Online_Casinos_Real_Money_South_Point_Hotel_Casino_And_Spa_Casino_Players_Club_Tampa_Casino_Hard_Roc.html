    <h1>Online Casinos Real Money South Point Hotel Casino And Spa Casino Players Club Tampa Casino Hard Roc</h1>

<p>Dear Sirs and Madames,</p>
<p>on March 19, 2020 I made a deposit of € 40 with the second deposit bonus of 70% from Slotwolf. After fulfilling the bonus conditions, I made a withdrawal request for my € 650 winnings.</p>
<p>I went through the verification process without any problems, so all my documents were accepted.</p>
<p>Now I received the information by email that I allegedly misused the guidelines of the casino. As a reason, I am given that only one account per household / IP is entitled to a bonus.</p>
<p>A violation of this directive on my part is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>I always pay close attention to the guidelines and bonus conditions of casinos, as these can sometimes be very tricky.</p>
<p>I then contacted the live chat and had extensive discussions with several employees about the alleged violation.</p>
<p>Nobody could tell me which avoidable second account I should have created. In addition, the deposit of € 40 was credited back to me. All other deposits with bonuses that I have already made and lost will of course not be refunded. I find this very questionable against the background that, according to Slotwolf, I shouldn't have used the bonuses.</p>
<p>Since none of the live chat supporters could help me, I contacted Slotwolf by email and received the same text block that I should have violated the bonus conditions and no further information can be given. How am I supposed to prove the opposite here?</p>
<p>I researched similar cases on the Internet and came across the following case from this forum here in January 2020: https://de.casino.guru/slot-wolf-casino-die-gewinne-des-spielers-aus-dem</p>
<p>The accused in this post describes exactly the same problem as me.</p>
<p>I quote here the statement from Slotwolf Casino on the above case:</p>
<p>"Thank you for highlighting the issue. We checked everything and found that the funds were mistakenly confiscated. We really apologize for the incident. The entire amount has been returned to the account.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Slot Wolf Casino "</p>
<p>I assume that in my case it is also an accident and therefore please transfer my honestly earned profit of € 650 to my account.</p>
<p>I hope that the case will be cleared up quickly.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help and best regards</p>
<p>David Schneider</p>
