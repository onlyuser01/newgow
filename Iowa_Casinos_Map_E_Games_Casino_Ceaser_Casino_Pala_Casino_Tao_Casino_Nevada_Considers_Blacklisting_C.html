    <h1>Iowa Casinos Map E Games Casino Ceaser Casino Pala Casino Tao Casino Nevada Considers Blacklisting C</h1>

<p>This week, the Nevada Gaming Control Board unanimously voted to nominate a casino chip thief to be added to the state's black book, banning him permanently from all casinos</p>
<p>To ensure that specific individuals cannot access casinos across Nevada, the state has created a “black book,” or otherwise a list of patrons who are permanently banned from visiting any of the casinos in the state. Different people can land on that list, but they do need to meet certain criteria such as receiving a ban from court or having a felony conviction.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), the list of banned individuals may increase with the addition of a person who was convicted of stealing chips several years ago. The person, identified as Neal Ahmed Hearne, may become the 37th individual who will be permanently banned from all casinos across Nevada after his nomination to the black book, as announced by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>John Michela, Senior Deputy Attorney General, spoke in front of the NGCB during the meeting that took place Wednesday. He showed video evidence of Hearne where the person is seen grabbing chips from a table and running away. In a separate video, also presented in front of the gambling regulator, Hearne can be seen grabbing chips from a table as one customer temporarily left their seat. He then flees the area on foot.</p>
<p>According to Michela, the two presented cases aren’t the only ones for Hearne, who was eventually arrested for his crimes and subsequently sentenced in January 2018. The Senior Deputy Attorney General explained that Hearne engaged in the same unsophisticated crime that involved him taking chips from tables in more than a dozen casinos across Clark County. In light of this, Michela said that the person needs to be added to the state’s black book, effectively banning him from visiting any casino across Nevada.</p>
<p>One Step Away from Joining the State’s Black Book</p>
<p>Kirk Hendrick, NGCB’s chairman, was shocked to see the actions of Hearne on video. “Sometimes reading the documents is one thing, but seeing it actually happen,” he pointed out. Additionally, Hendrick explained: “It’s clearly obvious that Mr. Hearne’s criminal actions are not only brazen — that he would do this right in the middle of a casino floor — but his criminal activities are prolific.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to convince NGCB about Hearne’s recommendation to be added to the black book, especially considering his felony conviction, something that is a part of the criteria to be added to the list. As a result, the NGCB voted unanimously, nominating Hearne to be permanently banned from all casinos in the state.</p>
<p>With the nomination in place, the person will now be given a chance to defend himself. After the formal nomination, the Nevada Gaming Commission will have to officially decide whether or not to add Hearne to the list and that will happen after an organized hearing where he will be invited to attend.</p>
