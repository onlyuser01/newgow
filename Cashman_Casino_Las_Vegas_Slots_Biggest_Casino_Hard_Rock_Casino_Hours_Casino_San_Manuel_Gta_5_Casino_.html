    <h1>Cashman Casino Las Vegas Slots Biggest Casino Hard Rock Casino Hours Casino San Manuel Gta 5 Casino</h1>

<p>The company confirmed Monday it expanded further its global presence by opening a new studio located in the Balkan country. Located in Bucharest, the new studio offers Eclipse Blackjack, Standard Roulette as well as Standard Blackjack tables.</p>
<p>The new studio leverages a unique localization digital branding environment that is built well and can create benefits for partner operators. The presenters of the live games are broadcast in English, as well as Italian and Romanian languages.</p>
<p>This makes OnAir Entertainment’s new studio a perfect fit for companies looking to enter those markets or deliver new and exciting experiences for its customer base. Besides the aforementioned titles, the company confirmed its plans to add more exciting games to its new studio.</p>
<p>“The state-of-the-art content of OnAir Entertainment is ready for those forward-thinking operators, who are already showing interest to add these tables to their game portfolios,“ reads a statement released by OnAir Entertainment</p>
<p>Moreover, OnAir Entertainment confirmed that it is already receiving attention from operators that are looking to expand its offering by adding the company’s leading products. This comes as no surprise, considering the popularity of OnAir’s content.</p>
<p>In fact, since it introduced its first live table, the company has entered 10 different jurisdictions. This was achieved in less than a year and a half. Now, considering the launch in Romania, OnAir confirmed it plans to enter into the regulated market in Italy as well as South Africa.</p>
<p>The Company Completes Another Successful Launch</p>
<p>The announcement brought excitement to OnAir’s business development director, Seval Kaya, who acknowledged that the company is delighted to deliver customized gaming experiences via its Italian and Romanian tables to its growing list of partners. The business development director explained that the company’s products stand out with quality and unique design. “Our service-minded approach combined with a strong game portfolio will be a great addition to the Romanian market,” added Kaya. Finally, the director explained that the company is excited to see its teams complete another successful launch.</p>
<p>“We are overjoyed to be able to provide our customized games experiences and outstanding opportunities for our customers with Romanian and Italian tables.“ Seval Kaya, business development director at OnAir Entertainment</p>
<p>The recent launch comes on the heels of another important announcement. Late last month, OnAir announced the release of Blazing Dragon Tiger, another new hit title for the growing online gambling market.</p>
