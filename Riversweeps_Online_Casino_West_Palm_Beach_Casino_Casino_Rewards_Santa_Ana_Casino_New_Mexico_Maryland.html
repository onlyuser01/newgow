<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Virginia and Purdue played an instant classic of an NCAA Tournament basketball game Saturday night, with the Cavaliers pulling out an 80-75 overtime victory in the South Regional Final at the Yum Center to advance to their first Final Four in 35 years.</p>

<p>But the outcome wasn’t just an emotional one for the players on the court. After Virginia’s Kyle Guy hit two free throws with :05 left, the Cavaliers led 78-75. Purdue had the ball and a chance to tie and force another overtime.</p>
<p>Instead, not only did Purdue end up losing. So, too, did those who took the Boilermakers getting 4.5 points against the favored Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Carsen Edwards brought the ball up the court for Purdue, but the guard made a bad pass to Ryan Cline, who couldn’t control the ball before it went out of bounds.</p>
<p>Virginia received the ball. That forced Purdue to foul in desperation in hopes of extending the game and keeping its season alive. But, when Kihei Clark hit both of his free throws with a second left, it not only secured the victory for Virginia but for those who gave the points as well.</p>
<p>Plays of the Game</p>
<p>Edwards, who played an outstanding game otherwise with a game-high 42 points, said he expected the Cavaliers to foul him and keep him from shooting a 3-pointer.</p>
<p>We had a screen in for Ryan, and I was trying to kick it ahead before he fouled me,” said Edwards, who made 10-of-19 3-pointers. “And I just, just kind of, I kind of… It was a tough catch for Ryan, and just how it happens… I felt like the play was able to work. It’s just kind of how things ended up.”</p>
<p>Virginia’s Kyle Guy said they wanted to foul Edwards, and he said Clark tried to foul Edwards as he brought the ball up the floor.</p>
<p>“While (Clark) was doing that, I kind of let Cline go because I thought we were fouling,” Guy said. “So, if that pass was completed, we might be in a different situation right now.”</p>
<p>The closing seconds served as the final gut-wrenching twist in a game filled with them. It went to overtime only after missed free throw by the Cavaliers Ty Jerome led to a miracle buzzer-beating jumper by Virginia’s Mamadi Diakite.</p>
<p>‘Heartbreaking’ Ending for Some Bettors</p>
<p>Reaction in social media came in swift after the final horn sounded.</p>
<p>FanDuel Sportsbook noted the “last second cover” by the Cavaliers on Twitter.</p>
<p>Others were more emotional.</p>
<p>“This is the worst bad beat of the season so far,” tweeted We Beat The Spread. “We had Purdue +4.5, up by 2 and they miss the rebound on a free throw, get sent to OT, get a turnover with a chance to tie and miss the cover by .5 in overtime.</p>
<p>“Worst bad beat of the entire season. Heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Alex Syse, who wagered on the Cavaliers, posted a screen capture on his Twitter feed showing Purdue had nearly a 97 percent probability to cover with :22 remaining in regulation.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely speechless,” he wrote. “What an all time cover. Possibly the greatest ever. God bless Kyle Guy. God bless America.”</p>
<p>The Elite Eight wraps up on Sunday with the final two teams punching their tickets for Saturday’s Final Four. Kentucky plays Auburn in Kansas City, Mo., and Duke squares off against Michigan State.</p>
