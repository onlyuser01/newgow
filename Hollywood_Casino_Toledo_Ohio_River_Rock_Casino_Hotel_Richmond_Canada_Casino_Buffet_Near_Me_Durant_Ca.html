<p>Lebanon, N.H., planning board members will discuss the proposed gaming property at the site formerly housing Gerrish Honda.</p>
<p>The board must schedule a site visit, as well as hold a public hearing on the proposal.</p>
<p>Locally, the street is called Miracle Mile.</p>
<p>If the project is approved, it will include a gaming space and a 41-seat restaurant/bar, the Valley News, a New Hampshire news organization, reported.</p>
<p>The gaming floor will have 111 electronic gaming devices and 90 gaming tables, according to the proposal.</p>
<p>As envisioned, it would include 17,335-square feet on the first floor. There also would be a 1,360-square-foot mezzanine.</p>
<p>The project would use the existing building. It is currently vacant.</p>
<p>The casino would mean an increase in traffic in the area, Engineering Ventures, a Lebanon-based consultant, predicted.</p>
<p>Site Was Car Dealership</p>
<p>The property, a former Honda dealership, was sold in 2016 to Gengras Motor Cars, a Connecticut-based auto dealer.</p>
<p>Its principal is Jonathan Gengras. Gengras and Stefan Huba, a consultant who specializes in developing casinos, are the developers of the project.</p>
<p>Gengras will remain the owner of the Miracle Mile property. He will lease it to Huba, the report said.</p>
<p>If given approvals, the casino must donate 35% of proceeds to charitable nonprofits under New Hampshire law.</p>
<p>Games can include poker, bingo, lottery, keno, and raffles, the Valley News said. Also allowed are roulette, blackjack, and electronic slot machines, the report added.</p>
<p>The charitable organizations must be approved by the New Hampshire Lottery Commission.</p>
<p>The current list of permitted organizations includes over 12,000 non-profits.</p>
<p>Lebanon already has one charitable casino. It is called the Lebanon Poker Room &amp; Casino. It opened in 2018. It offers poker, blackjack, roulette, and some 34 slot machines.</p>
<p>Lebanon is located near the New Hampshire-Vermont border.</p>
<p>Concord Proposal</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Concord, N.H., some 58 miles southeast of Lebanon, a planned charitable gaming complex is likely to be reviewed by Concord Planning Board members next month, the Concord Monitor newspaper reported.</p>
<p>It will include a casino, hotel, and restaurant. It will feature a 24,000-square-foot gaming floor.</p>
<p>That will have 634 seats. Plans also call for an 8,500-square-foot restaurant and brew-pub. It would have seating for about 150.</p>
<p>A hotel and event center would be developed later, according to current plans.</p>
<p>The developer is Andy Sanborn, who owns the Draft Sports Bar &amp; Grill and the Concord Casino, a charitable casino in Concord. He is a former New Hampshire state senator. In the Senate, he was chair of the Commerce, Health/Human Services and Ways and Means committees. He also ran for Congress.</p>
<p>Sanborn predicts the new casino would lead to over 250 jobs. It will also increase local tourism.</p>
<p>But Bruce Carri, who lives near the site of the planned casino, has been worried about increased traffic, the Monitor said.</p>
<p>Given that this is a gateway from the east of the city, I’m not sure it’s the best use of the site to have a casino be the first thing people see when they come in from the Seacoast,” Carri was quoted by the Monitor.</p>
<p>“It’s not the best image for the Capital City that we should want to convey.”</p>
