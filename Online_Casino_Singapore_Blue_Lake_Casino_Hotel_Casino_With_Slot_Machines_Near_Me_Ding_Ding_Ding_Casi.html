<p>Online gaming brand Rush Street Interactive (RSI) announced it was selected as the sports betting operations partner of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation (CLC) ahead of the official launch of sports wagering in the state.</p>
<p>Exclusive Long-Term Deal</p>
<p>The 10-year partnership agreement between the CLC and RSI will see the Chicago-based gaming brand become the lottery’s exclusive provider of sports wagering systems across all channels, mobile, online and retail, and CLC’s mobile and online sportsbook.</p>
<p>We are honored to be selected by the CLC to bring sports betting to the state and people of Connecticut. This partnership represents a significant milestone for RSI, as the trust and confidence of a state-backed organization such as the CLC further validates the strength of our award-winning online gaming platform and customer service.” Richard Schwartz, President, RSI</p>
<p>The partnership between the CLC and RSI will include the running of sports betting operations from up to 15 retail locations statewide, among which is included Hartford XL Center in Bridgeport, as well as via a statewide online sports betting skin, subject to RSI being granted a license by the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with the team at Rush Street Interactive. We had 15 quality proposals from well-established gaming companies, and RSI rose to the top through the combination of its experience and commitment to quality products, customer service, and responsible gaming safeguards.” Greg Smith, President and CEO, CLC</p>
<p>No Commercial Competition</p>
<p>The long-term agreement with the CLC presents a huge opportunity for RSI to establish its presence in a state where only three entities have rights to operate mobile and retail sports betting, having teamed up with the only operator of retail sports wagering outside of tribal territories.</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive is a respected sports betting and gaming company that has established itself as a leading innovator in the industry. We are impressed not only with RSI’s successes in other jurisdictions, particularly in neighboring New York and New Jersey, but also its commitment to responsible gambling practices.” Rob Simmelkjaer, Chairman, CLC Board of Directors</p>
<p>Currently live in ten states, RSI is the leader in the three most populous states that legalized sports betting – Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York. According to an industry report released in July, it ranks 5th in gross gaming revenue over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Building on our proven track record of success in the tri-state area, where RSI was an early entrant in New Jersey and is the market leader in retail sports betting amongst New York’s commercial casinos, we are thrilled to collaborate with the CLC team to offer Connecticuters safe, convenient, and unique gaming experiences.” Richard Schwartz, President, RSI</p>
<p>The CLC is planning on establishing 11 of the retail sports betting locations in seven out of the ten cities with the most population. In doing so, the multi-billion enterprise that also operates nearly 3,000 retailers throughout Connecticut will reach more than a quarter of the state’s population, leaving the additional coverage to the online sports betting skin.</p>
