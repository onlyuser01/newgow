    <h1>Casino In Biloxi Mississippi Free Casino Games Slots Red Dog Casino No Deposit Bonus Best Casino Odd</h1>

<p>Light &amp; Wonder has announced that Connie James, the company’s Executive Vice President, Treasurer, Corporate Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer, will be stepping down. Her withdrawal from the company, as a whole, will come into effect on August 25, with James pursuing new opportunities outside Light &amp; Wonder.</p>
<p>She will be temporarily succeeded by Oliver Chow, who is currently SVP of Corporate Finance at Light &amp; Wonder and will work as interim CFO while the company is looking for a new person for the job.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Chief Executive Officer Matt Wilson commented on the departure of one of his company’s top professionals and said that James had had a pivotal role in establishing the company as it was, touting her financial prowess and a solid understanding of the business needs.</p>
<p>"Connie has played a key role in advancing Light &amp; Wonder’s cultural and financial transformation, which has led to operational excellence, double-digit growth, and a strengthened balance sheet."</p>
<p>Her role as part of the company has been important, with Wilson and the entire Board and management wishing James to do well in her future undertakings. James was similarly pleased to have spent all this time with the company.</p>
<p>She herself called the time with Light &amp; Wonder one of the best of her career, praising the professionals involved with the company and touting the business strategy which has been based on considerable efficiencies and has made the company extremely resilient and flexible.</p>
<p>As to Chow, he is definitely a smart pick for Light &amp; Wonder at this time, as confirmed by the CEO. Chow has more than 15 years of relevant experience in the industry, and specifically a deep understanding of finance. He will now be supporting Light &amp; Wonder as the company continues to seek future growth opportunities and create a business model that does not rely too heavily on any one particular segment.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder previously signed a renewed deal with Betsson Group, which scaled the two companies’ collaboration globally. The company has also been pushing ahead with various technological leaps, including the rollout of its Shift4 solution.</p>
