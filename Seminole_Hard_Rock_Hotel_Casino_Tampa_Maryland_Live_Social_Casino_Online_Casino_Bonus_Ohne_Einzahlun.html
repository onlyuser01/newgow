<p>In recent years, Spinks suffered from prostate cancer. More than a year ago, the Spinks family reported it had spread to his bladder, according to the New York Times. Spinks, a former Olympic light heavyweight gold medalist, died in a Henderson, Nevada, hospital.</p>
<p>Spinks was 24 years old and only had a 6-0-1 professional record when he faced Ali at the Las Vegas Hilton on Feb. 15, 1978. The hotel-casino, just east of the Las Vegas Strip, now is the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino.</p>
<p>At the time, Ali held the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council heavyweight titles. He was the overwhelming favorite to win. He outweighed Spinks, 224 to 197 pounds.</p>
<p>However, Ali was 36 years old and considered past his prime. Spinks beat Ali in a 15-round split decision. This was the only time Ali lost a title in the ring.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that Ali wasn’t at his best, but Leon shocked everybody with how good Leon was,” promoter Bob Arum said in a story published on the ESPN website.</p>
<p>Ali said Spinks “had the will to win and the stamina.”</p>
<p>He hit pretty hard,” Ali said.</p>
<p>Later that month, Spinks appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, flashing a gap-tooth smile above the word “Leon!”</p>
<p>Seven months later, Ali defeated Spinks in a title rematch at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans before more than 63,000 fight fans. The bout was televised on ABC.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of the original Spinks-Ali fight.</p>

<p>‘Going to be Somebody’</p>
<p>Spinks had grown up poor in St. Louis and was bullied as a frail child who had asthma, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p>He became involved in boxing at 13 and dropped out of high school during his junior year to join the Marine Corps. He later said the Marine Corps made him a man.</p>
<p>After Olympic success in the 1976 Montreal Games, Spinks embarked on a professional career. His first pro fight was Jan. 15, 1977, at the Aladdin hotel-casino in Las Vegas. That site now is the location of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino on the Strip. In his debut, the 195-pound Spinks beat 185-pound “Lightening” Bob Smith in a fifth-round technical knockout.</p>
<p>A year later, Spinks would defeat Ali at the nearby Hilton. That night he told Sports Illustrated his father had gone around telling people he would “never be anything.”</p>
<p>“I made up my mind that I was going to be somebody in this world,” Spinks said.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Spinks last fought in December 1995, losing in St. Louis to Fred Houpe, a 45-year-old boxer who had gone 17 years without a fight before then, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>Spinks was 42 when he retired with a record of 26-17-3. The final decades were difficult financially. He cleaned locker rooms and bathrooms at a YMCA in Columbus, Nebraska. He unloaded McDonald’s trucks. After moving to Southern Nevada, he could be seen at sites such as Planet Hollywood, selling autographed pictures for $50 each.</p>
<p>Asked at an autograph session if Ali was the toughest person he ever faced, Spinks smiled. He respectfully said no, the toughest person he ever faced was his mom.</p>
<p>In 2017, Spinks was inducted in the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame. His brother, Michael, and a son, Cory, also were champion boxers.</p>
<p>Spinks is among several well-known people connected to Las Vegas who died recently, including Siegfried Fischbacher of the Siegfried and Roy entertainment duo.</p>
<p>In December, Dawn Wells, star of the 1960s sitcom Gilligan’s Island and a former Miss Nevada, died in Los Angeles. Also in December, popular singer Phyllis McGuire died in Las Vegas.</p>
