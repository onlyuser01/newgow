<p>Best Slot Strategy? Pick the Best Online Slots</p>
<p>Simply enough, the best slot machine strategy is to choose a slot game that gives you the best chance of winning. While going solely on a game’s return-to-player (RTP) rate isn’t always the best call, years of experience have proven that such games simply tend to benefit the player more in the long term.</p>
<p>However, a great slot will successfully combine slot volatility, RTP, betting limits, and bonus game features. Many slot machines have rewarded players generously, not through sheer return rate, but by combining all key components of a game.</p>
<p>We have put together a shortlist to help you understand what great slots look like. In our case, we recommend personal favorites such as:</p>
<p>Jack and the Beanstalk</p>
<p>Book of Dead</p>
<p>Starburst</p>
<p>Gonzo’s Quest</p>
<p>Bonanza Megaways</p>
<p>Greedy Goblins</p>
<p>Immortal Romance</p>
<p>Naturally, we will all have slightly different preferences, but the above list is a good starting point. If the games on the list aren’t immediately available in your locale, don’t worry. There are still many great slots to choose from, and you are bound to discover them quickly.</p>
<p>We love the above list for various reasons. Jack and the Beanstalk may be listed at 96.28% in terms of RTP, but the Walking Wild feature is a fantastic way to experience slot machines and boost your winning potential.</p>
<p>Gonzo’s Quest comes with the amazing Avalanche Reels, and Book of Dead incorporates the Gambling feature that allows you to take your chances on negligible wins and turn them into something more substantial.</p>
<p>Pick the Best Payback Percentage Slots to Turn a Win</p>
<p>As touched on above, focusing on the highest payback percentage slot machine is a great strategy. Of course, this doesn’t mean they have the highest chances of winning, as the slot’s specific volatility could be at odds with what you want to achieve in the short term.</p>
<p>However, a casino slot with a higher-than-average RTP will always make it possible to win in a few more instances than older slots that sport a modest 95%. Then again, you ought to know that games such as Book of Dead don’t offer much in terms of return-to-player, but they do well when you factor in all the fantastic features that offer slight but tangible rewards for the casino player.</p>
<p>Does every successful slot strategy take into consideration the highest RTP slots? Perhaps not, but it’s a good starting point if you are new to the seemingly endless world of online slots. Remember, high RTP does not necessarily mean the best odds to win.</p>
<p>Try the Free Play Feature Extensively</p>
<p>Arguably the best strategy for slots is to play for free before you commit, and that is precisely what you should do. All trusted casinos set the Random Number Generator (RNG) to reflect the real money settings when you are playing. In other words, you have direct access to each slot machine documentation and can study its features up close, as well as try the payouts.</p>
<p>We used to invest a lot of time and copious amounts of money to study slot gameplay, but today we can simply play games in a free setting before committing any real cash. The upshot? We are able to study games and deduce which games have superior features that increase your chances of turning a profit.</p>
<p>You will always want to approach a slot with care and even trust your fellow players’ opinions on whether a slot makes sense to play. The best way to be certain is to check out the free play slot version and see what the dynamic of the game is.</p>
<p>Progressive Slots: Are They Worth It?</p>
<p>Progressive slots are an interesting part of the slot experience. Designed to dish out life-changing sums, passing up on these games seems like a bit of waste. Therefore, exploring a slot machine strategy that may help you win a little more playing slots with a jackpot feature seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Progressive jackpots operate to individual rules, and your strategy will need to adapt based on the game you are willing to explore. What seems to work, though, is considering each individual game. Are you playing Mega Moolah? Then you probably know that you have to bet the maximum amount of money to have a better chance of triggering the progressive jackpot feature.</p>
<p>This is not the case with Divine Fortune and Halls of Good, though. While there are proven ways that will boost your winning at slots, jackpot slots are a bit elusive. You can never know for a fact that your strategy will work as it all boils down to chance.</p>
<p>Chasing a progressive jackpot is probably not a good slot strategy, but if you find a game where the base game is equally rewarding as the prospect of a big lump sum of money, you may be onto a good thing. Therefore, the key to winning more is not hitting the jackpot but doing well in the base game.</p>
<p>Volatility Matters – Like a Lot</p>
<p>For a while there, the slot community only cared about the RTP, but as resources became readily available online, the player base found out about volatility. You know what volatility is already – it’s the frequency of producing a winning combination relative to the amounts you win on average. There are three types of volatility:</p>
<p>Low Volatility</p>
<p>High Volatility</p>
<p>Medium Volatility</p>
<p>Low volatility means that you will win more often but win less. High volatility means that you need to arm yourself with some patience and play slots while waiting for a bigger payout. Medium volatility tries to balance and give you the most out of the slot machines.</p>
<p>Which one is best for you will depend on some factors that are unique to your situation. How much can you afford to lose is usually one of those factors. Are you playing on a tight budget, or do you have a little more to spend, allowing you to play rounds without turning any profit in anticipating a more substantial win?</p>
<p>It really boils down to slot players choosing what online slot they prefer, but it’s best to take advantage of the casino games that fit your personality.</p>
<p>Branded Slots: What a Fun Experience</p>
<p>With so many slot machines out there, you may spot a few that remind you of a popular TV series or movie. From Narcos to Rick and Morty, to Game of Thrones and Vikings, there are actually quite a few slots based on popular culture or inspired by cinema. As such, you will be naturally drawn to beloved franchises that have finally arrived in the world of casino gaming.</p>
<p>Devising a slot machine strategy that works for your favorite branded slots is no different than any other slot, really. What you need to do is focus on the gameplay and explore it in its entirety. Once again, there is no need to pay to play, but if you do want to, we recommend finding a casino that offers a bonus for the game you enjoy.</p>
<p>With branded slots, there are always bonuses waiting for you to claim. Outside of the promotion end of things, each branded slot should be taken on its own merits. Some may perform much better than others and help you win more than you lose. Remember, though, that slot machines always boil down to pure luck that you have little influence over on the face of it.</p>
<p>We truly enjoy Game of Thrones and Rick and Morty as they have a pacey dynamic of the gameplay that allows us to have a great time while still spending our bankroll reasonably. You are very welcome to try branded slot machines you enjoy, too, though!</p>
<p>Claim Free Spins and Pick the Best Casinos</p>
<p>Since we have mentioned bonuses, it’s good to know that you can give yourself a proper leg-up by finding the best free spins and slot bonuses presently available. Slot machines, in general, contribute 100% to almost all playthrough requirements, so finding an option that fits is often easy!</p>
<p>Now, we are not suggesting that you make free spin bonuses a major part of your slot machine strategy, but we can confirm that adding free spins to your gaming session will boost your odds of winning, notwithstanding any playthrough requirements.</p>
<p>Remember about wagering requirements and consider the slot machine you will be spending the free spins on. Each spin will have an inherent value, too, which is usually set at 0.10. A big win may occur during the free spins bonus, but you must remember that the winnings will be capped.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite some of the limitations, there are many great bonuses that promise to boost your slot experience and, if you are willing to deposit and pay for a welcome bonus, for example, you may end up boosting your bankroll by a fair bit right from the start.</p>
<p>The Best Slot Machine Tips</p>
<p>Bringing a good attitude with you when playing slots is one of the ingredients of success. Since there is not much that you can do to influence the gameplay of a game through skill, you can develop the mindset that allows you to increase your chances of success.</p>
<p>Learning when to cut your losses and walk away is an essential skill when you play slots. You want to balance between the thrill of the chase and what you can realistically expect from the slot machines on any given day. That is why one of the most important slot machine tips is to not play with emotions. If you win the jackpot, it would be wise to walk away as the chances you will win again soon, especially in the same game is practically 0%.</p>
<p>Some days are not meant to be too lucky, and that is perfectly fine. A great player will know how to reduce their risk by minimizing potential losses to their bankroll. You don’t want to be spending too much time playing slots too quickly, and this brings us to our next essential ingredient – how much you spend per hour and per spin.</p>
<p>Only Bet What You Can Afford to Lose</p>
<p>Understandably, an online slot is neither good nor bad. It’s a pure probability with the odds stacked against you – just the right amount. To be more successful playing slots, though, you will want to only play with money you can afford to lose playing. Many players approach slot machines as a source of income, which is wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, you can win, and you can win big, but there is no formula to it. The number of hours or the amounts you bet per spin won’t make much of a difference. Therefore, you must understand how the paytable works and know when a slot is just running against you, and you need to cool off a bit, but most importantly.</p>
<p>Do not ever pine after the money you have lost on slots online. Treat the activity as a hobby, and don’t spend another moment worrying about what slot machines.</p>
<p>Can I Manipulate Slot Machines by Stopping the Reels?</p>
<p>One slot machine strategy tested by players has been to cut the spin of the reels short of producing “better outcomes.” This has proven to be a myth, and your success will depend on luck, nothing more. The spins usually spin too quickly for you to be able to predict any outcome, and it’s not as if you could pinpoint the reels the way you see them. There are always a few more clicks of the reels coming after.</p>
<p>However, if you do start trying to stop the reels too often, you will probably increase the number of spins per hour and run the risk of burning out. You won’t be having fun, and you will be on a fool’s errand. But why would anyone try to stop the reels from running their full course?</p>
<p>Look, back in the day, some old slot machines could actually be influenced, but technology has caught up, and there is no provable way that you can influence your casino slot wins anymore.</p>
<p>Looking for a Slot? Ask the Community</p>
<p>There are over 20,000 online slot machines out there, and, as you can imagine, knowing about each and every one of them is an impossible task. The good news is that you do not have to, and you can do what many fellow slot players do – they ask around. It’s a slot strategy that works because it allows you to find out more about games that enjoy the community’s stamp of approval.</p>
<p>There is probably a reason why a casino slot is not too popular – or just the opposite, and it’s quite popular. Of course, there may be some slots that players don’t advertise too openly, but sooner or later, you are bound to catch wind of the rumors about this or that slot machine that is really worth your money.</p>
<p>In any event, joining Facebook groups or Reddit discussions could be a good way to familiarize yourself with more games, and remember, when in doubt, you can try a slot machine as a demo version and transition to real money gameplay later on.</p>
