<p>FanDuel Inks New Sports Betting Deal with Pat McAfee, Reportedly for $30M Annually</p>

<p>FanDuel on Thursday showed Pat McAfee the money. The sports betting operator and iGaming company announced the former NFL player turned sports media personality would remain an exclusive partner in a multi-year deal.</p>

<p>Terms weren’t announced in a FanDuel press release. But in a video, McAfee said it’s a three-year deal with an option for a fourth year.</p>
<p>We just got paid an absurd amount of money,” McAfee said in the video.</p>
<p>Shams Charania of The Athletic reported on Twitter, citing industry sources, that the deal was worth $30 million annually.</p>
<p>Makeover on the Way</p>
<p>The deal means FanDuel will continue to be the official sportsbook partner of Pat McAfee Inc. and the Pat McAfee Show.</p>
<p>McAfee’s show, which runs live on YouTube weekdays from noon-3 pm ET, will also get a new look, as the Indianapolis-based studio gets a makeover, with FanDuel getting naming rights for its new set as well.</p>
<p>McAfee’s team will also be behind FanDuel promotions, including a “crowd-sourced Spread the Love” betting opportunity. Spread the Love is a special marketing promotion that FanDuel uses for select games in specific markets. Most times, FanDuel will adjust the point spread every time a certain number of bettors make a wager on the game.</p>
<p>The bet, in effect, becomes a bonus for bettors, as the spread becomes an absurd amount. Back in January 2000, the spread in an Indiana University basketball game topped more than 100 points.</p>
<p>Latest Sportsbook-Media Partnership</p>
<p>The McAfee-FanDuel partnership evolves as sports betting operators and gaming companies look to deepen their ties with media entities.</p>
<p>The best-known partnership is Penn National Gaming’s buy-in on Barstool Sports to make it the brand for the casino chain’s sportsbooks. In a move more comparable to FanDuel’s deal with McAfee, DraftKings earlier this year became a content distributor for Dan Le Batard’s Meadowlark Media.</p>
<p>FanDuel Chief Marketing Officer Mike Raffensperger said in the company’s release that McAfee is the “fastest-growing star” in sports media. He added that the company looks forward to doing more with McAfee’s team.</p>
<p>The company also said the Pat McAfee Show is “the gold standard” in terms of live-odds integration and broadcasting wagering content. That includes odds boosts and enhancements.</p>
<p>“Of course, Pat isn’t just our best marketing partner, he’s also one of our best customers, so we expect he will give us some of the money back,” Raffensperger joked.</p>
<p>Who is Pat McAfee?</p>
<p>McAfee, 34, played eight seasons in the NFL, all for the Indianapolis Colts. In a 2014 Indianapolis Star article, he talked about how winning $1,400 in an underground poker club led to him eventually getting a college scholarship to play football.</p>
<p>He was one of the top punters (the American football kind), but retired before age 30 to break into sports media. That included a stint with Barstool Sports, which he said in Thursday’s video helped him as he looked to get established.</p>
<p>He’s also been a broadcaster on ESPN and worked with the WWE as well.</p>
<p>His online show does attract a large audience for online media, which is a key target audience for companies like FanDuel. According to HypeAuditor, McAfee has 1.6 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. On Twitter, he has more than 2.2 million followers.</p>
<p>The average audience for one of McAfee’s YouTube videos is about 175,000, and the highest audience he’s had was nearly 617,000.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, his show has garnered attention for McAfee’s segments with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, which included Rogers discussing his bout with COVID-19 and the treatments he took instead of getting a vaccination.</p>
