<p>The company was accused of profiting from the tragedy of thousands of people</p>
<p>American gambling giant DraftKings has apologized for a September 11 promotion many believed to be insensitive. The promotion saw the gambling company incentivize people to bet by referencing the notorious terror attacks from 2001.</p>
<p>The controversial promotion was launched on the 22nd anniversary of the terrible attacks that killed almost 3,000 people. Titled “Never Forget,” the promotion was a parlay bet that required the Major League Baseball Jets, Mets and Yankees to win their Monday games.</p>
<p>Regardless of DraftKings’ intentions, the promotion was met with an instant backlash. Many people, including family members of people who perished in the terror attacks, called the reference to the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon “tone-deaf,” “insensitive” and “disgusting.”</p>
<p>The company was accused of profiting from the tragedy of thousands of people with many doubting that the offering was genuinely commemorative rather than a way to attract customers.</p>
<p>For example, the Associated Press spoke with Brett Eagleson, a member of 9/11 Justice. Eagleson, whose father was killed in the attacks, believes that referencing the terror attacks to promote a business is crass and “shameful.”</p>
<p>DraftKings Apologized and Took Down the Parlay</p>
<p>Following the backlash, DraftKings addressed the controversy, apologizing for the promotion. The company acknowledged that its commemorative bet left many unamused and assured fans that it “respects the significance” of 9/11 to the United States and everyone affected.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the featured parlay that was shared briefly in commemoration of 9/11. We respect the significance of this day for our country and especially for the families of those who were directly affected. DraftKings statement</p>

<p>DraftKings refused to comment further and did not disclose how many customers the parlay bet attracted. However, if customer screenshots are to be believed, at least several hundred people did place the wager.</p>
<p>DraftKings did not disclose whether it has canceled the bets of people who took it up on the offer either.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time a company has referenced the 9/11 attacks in a promotion. From arranging soda bottles in the shape of two towers to special promotions referencing the unfortunate event and tacky cartoons, companies have been trying to appeal to Americans’ sensitivities for years.</p>
<p>However, most people agree that it is best not to explore this topic when promoting products.</p>
