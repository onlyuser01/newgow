<p>Kindred Group has secured a partnership with AFC Ajax through its Unibet brand. This will reinforce the gambling company’s foothold in the Netherlands, a market it entered two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Kindred and Ajax to Work Together</p>
<p>Kindred aims to promote Unibet to local bettors and has decided that there is no better way to do it than to ink a deal with one of the powerhouses in Dutch soccer. The club competes in the Eredivisie, the Netherlands’ top-tier division and is a well-known name in the European sports landscape.</p>
<p>As partners, both Kindred Group’s Unibet and AFC Ajax will promote their brands. In addition, the two will work together on various responsible gambling activations and will encourage bettors to play safely. The partnership will also promote Unibet’s Impact program which teaches players how to enjoy betting without harm.</p>
<p>Through its dedication to responsible gambling, Kindred Group and its subsidiaries want to show that they truly care about their customers’ well-being. Speaking of it, in April, the company revealed that high-risk gamblers make up only 3.3% of its profits.</p>
<p>Both Parties Cherish Customer Safety</p>
<p>Menno Geelen, the commercial director of AFC Ajax commented on the deal. He said that his company is glad to be working with Kindred Group. In addition, Geelen lauded Unibet for its high-quality products and the way in which it engages fans.</p>
<p>Geelen confirmed that safer gambling will be a priority throughout Unibet and Ajax’s partnership. He is impressed with Kindred’s commitment to responsible betting and is looking forward to working together with the operator.</p>
<p>Lennart Kessels, Kindred Group’s general manager for the Netherlands, also shared his thoughts. He said that his whole team is “extremely proud” to be working with such a distinguished soccer team. Thanks to the partnership, Kindred will be able to invest more in Unibet Impact, a program based on partnerships with pro and amateur sports clubs.</p>
<p>Unibet Impact is dedicated to fostering a safer and more responsible online gambling industry, while bringing fun and entertainment to Dutch society. Specifically with Ajax, we want to focus on responsible gambling in relation to mental health. Lennart Kessels, general manager for the Netherlands, Kindred Group</p>
<p>Kindred launched in the Netherlands on June 8 after receiving all necessary approvals by the Kansspelautoriteit, the country’s gambling regulator.</p>
<p>On a separate note, the gambling company recently announced its plans to exit the German market. According to Kindred, the European country’s regulations are way too strict and make it impossible to achieve long-term sustainability.</p>
