<p>Information about Cardano casinos</p>
<p>Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that runs a crypto token known as ADA. Self-styled as an upgrade to Ethereum (ETH), it aims to provide digital banking services, as well as innovations such as smart contracts.</p>
<p>It's now possible to buy internet goods and services with ADA, as well as make deposits in Cardano online casinos. By reading this page, you'll find out how to transfer money to an ADA casino, the pros and cons of this crypto, how to find the best ADA sites and the bonuses that they offer.</p>

<p>ADA – a tribute to a 19th century countess that became one of the world's biggest cryptos</p>
<p>What do a Victorian noblewoman and a mathematician from Hawaii have in common? Well, in the world of crypto, they are both inspirations for one of the biggest altcoins out there.</p>
<p>Cardano is the brainchild of Hawaiian entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson, who began developing it as an alternative to Ethereum in 2015 through his company IOHK. As an ETH co-founder, he wanted to use his deep understanding of how the second-generation platform worked to form a third-generation alternative. In other words, one better-placed to embrace future technologies such as machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>He put this to the test in 2017, when he officially launched Cardano. It was a Proof-of-Stake network, seen as less risky than the Proof-of-Work method used by Bitcoin and ETH in that it makes it less advantageous for miners to attack the network. It's also thought to be more environmentally-friendly, but there's a lot of debate about this between experts.</p>
<p>Hoskinson and his team also made it a peer-reviewed platform in that key decisions are made by members after consulting evidence-based methods: a science-based strategy that set it apart from its rivals.</p>
<p>Note: The platform made small steps at first, with ADA steadily rising in value over the first few years of operation. In spring 2021, however, came a big announcement. As part of Cardano's mission to 'bring banking to the unbanked', it announced a huge project in Africa, aiming to develop Blockchain technology across the continent. Around the same time, ADA enjoyed a dramatic rise in price, doubling in value to an all-time high of $2.</p>
<p>Such projects back up Cardano's claims to be a global force and it's safe to say that it's now an established top ten crypto network. It's also the reason why more and more websites, including online casinos, are now accepting it as a payment method. The next section will explore the pros and cons of using it.</p>
<p>Oh, were you wondering where the countess comes in? This is from Hoskinson's deep love of mathematics, and Victorian mathematician Ada Lovelace is where ADA gets its name from.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of Cardano</p>
<p>Like with most cryptocurrencies, one of ADA's key strengths is its speed. Blockchain's decentralized nature means transactions can be processed almost instantly, without going through the red tape that fiat currencies often do. If you deposit ADA into an online casino, then you should expect to see your money in your account immediately, although network delays are not out of the question.</p>
<p>It should also be cheaper to make ADA deposits. Again, there is no central authority to charge a transaction fee, and casinos generally charge less than for traditional currency deposits.</p>
<p>It's also extremely secure. As mentioned, its proof-of-stake nature makes it tougher for hackers, and fraud is virtually impossible. The only problem is if you accidentally send it to the wrong place – then it could be very difficult to get your money back. You should always double- or triple-check the details before sending the funds.</p>
<p>Looking at possible downsides of ADA, some people might be disappointed at the lack of sites that accept it as a payment method. It doesn't enjoy the same fame as Bitcoin and many people simply don't know enough about it to use it. That's why there are more Bitcoin casinos than Cardano casinos.</p>
<p>You also can't phone somebody up if something goes wrong with an ADA transfer. Banks may be frustrating at times, but at least they have customer support teams who can investigate missing payments. This is always something to bear in mind with cryptocurrencies in general.</p>
<p>How to make a Cardano online casino deposit</p>
<p>Once you've found a great Cardano-friendly casino to play on – more about that later – then you'll probably want to make a deposit so that you can start playing right away.</p>
<p>The good news is that this is a relatively easy process. Before you start you should make sure you have the following:</p>
<p>An active Cardano wallet with enough ADA to cover your deposit amount</p>
<p>A fully open casino account</p>
<p>Five minutes</p>
<p>With those in place, you can start by going to the casino's cashier and selecting 'Cardano' or 'ADA' in the list of payment methods. You'll receive a deposit address that you need to send the funds to. Copy this and go to your crypto wallet. Paste it into the payment section there, along with the deposit amount, double-check, and send the payment.</p>
<p>The money should appear in your casino balance in a few moments. If it takes longer, then it might be worth getting in touch with your wallet and/or casino to see if there's a problem.</p>
<p>Note: It is possible to withdraw to your Cardano wallet, but this depends on the wallet or casino's terms and conditions. Withdrawals often come with a fee and may take longer than deposits to process. If you can't withdraw to your Cardano wallet, then the casino will have alternative payment methods for you to consider.</p>
<p>Finding the best Cardano casino for you</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important part of all: finding that Cardano casino that will give you a great playing experience. You can use this page to help you with that, as it provides you with filters to sort through the ADA sites on our database.</p>
<p>One of the filters is the 'Recommended' tab, which will give you the best ADA casinos for your country, in our opinion, when you click on it. We have come to this conclusion via an in-depth assessment that the Casino Guru team carries out for online casinos. This is based upon factors such as how many complaints it's received, how it deals with them and whether they have a positive reputation or not. Read more about how we do this in our How we rate online casinos article.</p>
<p>You can also find the newest Cardano casinos by selecting the 'Newly opened' tab. These are the freshest options on our list and might have a nice welcoming offer or two as they seek to build their reputation. The 'All' tab, meanwhile, will present you with the complete list of Cardano sites.</p>
<p>There are other filters that might interest you in your pursuit for the ideal casino. Some people like to see which game providers a casino has, for example, and you can view these by clicking your preferred option in the 'Game provider' filter – Red Tiger casinos and Microgaming casinos are popular options, for example...</p>
<p>Cardano casino bonuses</p>
<p>A good casino bonus is a potential win-win. The casino gets a new customer, and you get a nice perk, subject to certain conditions. You might get a deposit bonus after you transfer money into your casino account, or even a no deposit bonus for just registering.</p>
<p>You can find those bonuses offered by Cardano casinos on Casino Guru. Head to our list of casino bonuses and select 'Cardano' in the payment method section. From that list, you can also choose a specific type of bonus by going to the 'Bonus Type' section: here, you can take your pick – if you'd like no deposit bonuses, then just tick that box. You can also go to our list of no deposit bonuses and tick 'Cardano' there.</p>
