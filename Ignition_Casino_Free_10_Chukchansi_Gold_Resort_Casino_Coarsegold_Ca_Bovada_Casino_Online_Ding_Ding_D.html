<p>Israel-based digital entertainment company, Playtika, announced that it joined forces with Laurence Fishburne for a new commercial.</p>
<p>Laurence Fishburne Participates in a New Playtika WSOP Commercial</p>
<p>The legendary Hollywood actor participates in Playtika’s World Series of Poker (WSOP) play-for-fun poker game commercial. The new commercial launched in the US on Thursday, February 3. For Fishburne, the new commercial marks the first time he has teamed up with a mobile entertainment game.</p>
<p>“Laurence and his amazing personality and style really brings to life the WSOP player experience.” Ofer Kinberg, chief revenue officer at Playtika</p>
<p>Commenting on the topic, Playtika’s chief revenue officer, Ofer Kinberg, acknowledged that Fishburne has an amazing style and personality that helps bring to life the WSOP player experience. He explained that the company is proud it teamed up with the award-winning actor. In conclusion, Kinberg said that the commercial “complements the epic persona of Lawrence with the epic legacy of World Series of Poker for the benefit of our players.”</p>
<p>“It was a really interesting offer to join the project.” Laurence Fishburne</p>
<p>Fishburne added that the project sounded really interesting to him and he thought that he had to be a part of it. Acknowledging that he is aware of the WSOP, Fishburne said that he is “fascinated by the gamesmanship of it.” In conclusion, he explained that it is thrilling to be a part of the game and he hopes that he will bring joy to the people with his presence.</p>
<p>Become a Poker Legend</p>
<p>In the new commercial, Fishburne witnesses and narrates the story of a WSOP player called “StanDaMan.” The commercial itself is labeled “The Legend of World Series of Poker” where StanDaMan is after winning a digital version of the WSOP championship bracelet.</p>
<p>Just like the physical version, the digital WSOP bracelet is presented as one of the most desired non-monetary poker prizes. Although StanDaMan is sitting at a regular American diner, the background suddenly changes and he is portrayed as a part of the poker game itself.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have a strong hand, but he bets after the flop and the turn. In the end, StanDaMan bets all-in on the river and sees all of his opponents fold. All of a sudden the background changes and StanDaMan is now in a medieval royal dining hall that is full of guests dressed in colorful outfits. As the narrator of the story, Fishburne then says that “StanDaMan turned nothing into greatness.”</p>
