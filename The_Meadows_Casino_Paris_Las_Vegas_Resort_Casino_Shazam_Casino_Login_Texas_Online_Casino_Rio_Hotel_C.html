<p>New York based 27-year-old man charged in fraud allegations for a cryptocurrency scheme. The man, allegedly used $4.5 million collected from his victims for gambling but presented them an investment scheme.</p>
<p>Alleged Multi-Million Dollar Cryptocurrency Fraud</p>
<p>A 27-year-old, Douglas Jae Woo Kim has been charged in a criminal complaint at the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The complaint is for wire fraud and connects Kim to a multi-million dollar scheme to raise money for a cryptocurrency investment which was bogus. Instead, allegedly Kim was using the money to bet on online casinos located outside of the US. According to the allegation, Kim received more than $4.5 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) which he used to gamble.</p>
<p>His victims were not aware of that activity but were rather thinking that they are placing an investment and were expecting a profit. However, as it turns out, following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Kim was charged with one count of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.</p>
<p>How Did It All Begin?</p>
<p>According to the allegations, Kim’s activity began in October 2017. Kim allegedly contacted an investor by saying that he was investing in a cryptocurrency operation which provides profit fees. He described the project as “fairly modest operation.” Furthermore, Kim said that he already invested $300,000 – $400,000 and assured the investor that there was no risk. Once he received the cryptocurrency, Kim transferred half of the amount to a casino operator outside of the US which accepts Bitcoin currency.</p>
<p>A second encounter, described by the affidavit dates back to January 1, 2018, when Kim allegedly contacted his second victim. Once he received approximately $200,000 in Ether (ETH) he converted half of the funds to Bitcoin. In the next few days, Kim transferred the full amount to his personal account at a casino outside US borders. In total, Kim convinced his victims to transfer him an excessive of $4.5 million in various currencies.</p>
<p>Here it is important to mention that Kim currently only meets allegations that a crime has been committed. As per the US principals of Judicial System, Kim, as any other defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. With that in mind, in the event that he is convicted, Kim may be facing a penalty of up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000.</p>
