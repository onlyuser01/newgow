<p>Gamban has increased its North Americanpresence by partnering with KaFe Rock's Time2play to offer its services for the casino comparison site. Time2play is a platform that allows users to block access from all gambling websites installed on their devices. It is KaFe Rock's newest affiliate network. Its parent company operates in 15 markets and has 40 sites in its core engine network. Time2Play focuses on casino and sports betting.</p>
<p>The US-facing subsidiary of the Malta-based company has highlighted greater safety in betting and minimized gambling-related harm as key objectives. This deal is a further expansion by Gamban's international reach in 2022. It builds on its Spanish-language service, which was launched earlier this month.</p>
<p>Jack Symons, Gamban Co-Founder, stated, "It's vital that players understand that there is support available if things get out of control. Affiliates are positioned to make people aware of these resources early on. Through better visibility and accessibility of these resources, Time2play can raise standards for affiliates in reducing gambling harm."</p>
<p>Time2play, as part of the agreement, will provide its customers with free access to Gamban, if they want it. It will also allow them to bypass the $35 annual fee for using the blocking software.</p>
<p>Time2Play co-founder Tim Tepass added, "We wanted to do more to help any of our players that may be struggling with gambling addiction. Gamban was the obviouschoice for us because of its reliable technology. Other tools are easily bypassed and don't offer the same level of protection.</p>
<p>"We can't say that we are 'for the user' without considering the implications of our product on problem gamblers. While most of our visitors are casual players looking for information on a casino, some could be at higher risk of gambling addiction. We want to do everything we can to support those people, and this collaboration is just the beginning of our efforts."</p>
