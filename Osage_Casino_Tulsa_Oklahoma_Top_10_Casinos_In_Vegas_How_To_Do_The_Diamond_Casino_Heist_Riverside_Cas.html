    <h1>Osage Casino Tulsa Oklahoma Top 10 Casinos In Vegas How To Do The Diamond Casino Heist Riverside Cas</h1>

<p>The Washington Football Team became the first franchise from the National Football League (NFL) to join the American Gaming Association’s (AGA) responsible sports betting campaign “Have a Game Plan. Bet Responsibly.”</p>
<p>Getting sports betting right is a shared responsibility for everyone involved.” Casey Clark, SVP, AGA</p>
<p>Activations, Content and Promotions</p>
<p>The partnership with AGA will see “Have a Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” public campaign activations in the team’s stadium, content on the official website of the WFT, as well as responsible sports betting promotions aired on the team’s upcoming radio and television broadcasts.</p>
<p>With legal sports betting now permitted across our region, we are ensuring responsible gaming serves as a foundation for how we engage in this exciting commercial market.” Scott Shepherd, Chief Partnership Officer, Washington Football Team</p>
<p>The public service campaign, launched by the gaming industry representative body in late 2019, is aimed at educating fans of sports that sports betting can be fun and enjoyable, but can also be detrimental on a personal and social level if it becomes excessive.</p>
<p>We’re not only proud to partner with the AGA, the architect of Have A Game Plan, but also proud to lead by educating fans as they enjoy football in an engaging, new way.” Scott Shepherd, Chief Partnership Officer, Washington Football Team</p>
<p>Industry-Wide Campaign Support</p>
<p>The WFT joins the ranks of high-caliber sports betting operators like FanDuel and DraftKings, which also publicly expressed their support for the responsible sports betting initiative. Flutter’s FanDuel was the first sportsbook operator to join the campaign in March this year, while Boston-based DraftKings joined later in June.</p>
<p>The Washington Football Team’s partnership demonstrates their leadership and commitment to making responsibility core to their sports betting strategy. Today’s announcement puts Have A Game Plan in front of more fans and is a step further in building a responsible, sustainable legal market.” Casey Clark, SVP, AGA</p>
<p>“Have a Game Plan. Bet Responsibly” is also already endorsed by Monumental Sports and Entertainment, owner of the NBA’s Washington Wizards, NHL’s Washington Capitals and WNBA’s Washington Mystics, as well as professional sports leagues like NASCAR, NHL, PGA Tour and UFC.</p>
<p>The NFL team, formerly known as the Washington Redskins, had to change its name to Washington Football Team in July last year after public and investor pressure. However, almost a year later, the NFL franchise found itself in a tricky situation after discovering someone else has held a trademark on the new name from as early as 2015.</p>
