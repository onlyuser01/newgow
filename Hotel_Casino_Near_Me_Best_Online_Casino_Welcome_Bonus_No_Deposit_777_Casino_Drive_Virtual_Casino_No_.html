    <h1>Hotel Casino Near Me Best Online Casino Welcome Bonus No Deposit 777 Casino Drive Virtual Casino No</h1>

<p>I registered at 21casino and used the 50 free spins of 10 cents each (non deposit bonus) generated 6.20 from it. With the 6.20 I got Book of Dead 4 heads in the games on 20 cents and thus had 200 € on the clock. By continuing to play, I ended up with € 280 on my watch and wanted to convert it! According to the casino, this only works when you make a deposit. I did this and my minimum turnover to pay out the bonus went up to 9800 (so 35x) I was able to implement this bonus condition with a lot of luck and in the end I had € 3250 in real money in my account! Then I wanted to withdraw € 3100 and had to verify myself. 2 days later I received an email from the management that only from this 3100 € 100 € plus my deposit of 10 would be credited to me. Now of course I'm annoyed because I had read the terms and conditions and there is a maximum of 100 € in winnings from the free spins I assumed it only related to the free spins. It also said that all winnings over € 100 would be deducted. So find it a cheek to let a player wager € 10,000, let him play with the real money and then only agree to pay out the money is not available to you! Especially since in the bonus conditions there is an extra bonus without deposit! Since I had to make a deposit to be able to use the bonus, this no longer falls under the point ...</p>
<p>Does anyone know about this and could give me tips or assistance on how I can proceed against the casino?</p>
