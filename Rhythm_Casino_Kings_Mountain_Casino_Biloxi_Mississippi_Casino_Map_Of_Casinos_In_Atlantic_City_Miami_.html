    <h1>Rhythm Casino Kings Mountain Casino Biloxi Mississippi Casino Map Of Casinos In Atlantic City Miami</h1>

<p>You are talking utter rubbish. This is laughable and you are clearly corrupt. I get your shtick is 'Mr Empathy' but this doesn't work here when actual reality and facts are not being addressed:</p>
<p>Let's fact check you shall we.</p>
<p>1 - I was FULLY VERIFIED by the casino using their AI generated third part software.</p>
<p>2 - The casino unverified me when I requested a full withdrawal and my account closed.</p>
<p>3 - The casino has never explained why I was verified and then unverified...</p>
<p>4 - I have received no explanation as to why two subsequent proof of addresses were rejected.</p>
<p>5 - Why has my deposit been stolen? I never lost this, they are breaking EU consumer law by stealing this and caisnoguru is complicit in this.</p>
<p>6 - Why did the complaint just close? Extra evidence was requested from the casino and never provided.</p>
<p>You are simply allowing a casino to commit theft deposits under the guise of 'failing KYC' WHEN I WAS PROVABLY VERIFIED BEFORE I EVEN DEPOSITED!!!!!</p>
<p>I wish to complain about this joke of a service. How do I do this?</p>
<p>Cannot believe this site, you are a joke and I have a good mind to take legal action against you and the casino.</p>
<p>*Footnote - The casino flagged my reviews against them on trustpilot, they also refused to give me their registered business address so I could do a court order....Casino guru is simply allowing another scatterhall situation.</p>
