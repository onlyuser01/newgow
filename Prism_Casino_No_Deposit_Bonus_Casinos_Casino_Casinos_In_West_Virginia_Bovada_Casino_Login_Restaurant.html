    <h1>Prism Casino No Deposit Bonus Casinos Casino Casinos In West Virginia Bovada Casino Login Restaurant</h1>

<p>The famous American internet celebrity, streamer and adult content creator, Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa, announced a new partnership with Kick earlier this year. The announcement of the new collaboration came after another famous streamer, xQc, announced his plans to transition to Kick by signing a deal valued at a whopping $100 million.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the switch of Amouranth to Kick dealt a hit for Twitch, especially considering that she ranked as the most popular female streamer on the platform for 2022. Back in June, Siragusa released a video via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, titled “It’s time,” where she is portrayed reviewing the news about xQc’s partnership with Kick. She then talked with the same agent who participated in the negotiation for xQc’s $100 million dollar deal. In the end, Amouranth confirms that she joined the platform as well.</p>
<p>Now, a new report suggests that the partnership between Siragusa and Kick significantly boosted the revenue of the famous streamer. As announced by Dexerto, Amouranth confirmed that her streaming contract with the platform had a “similar concept” to the one with xQc. She explained that she could not disclose actual figures about the deal but reiterated that the partnership with Kick was arranged through the same agent.</p>
<p>“I can’t talk about the actual numbers, but we got signed around the same time through the same agent. It’s a very similar concept.“ Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa</p>
<p>The Deal with Kick Doubled the Streamer’s Income</p>
<p>When asked again, Amouranth refrained from disclosing numbers but admitted that her collaboration with the streaming platform doubled her income. “It’s very lucrative for sure. It’s non-exclusive, so you can stream on Kick and Twitch, so it’s set up the same way,” she added.</p>
<p>“It basically doubled my income across the board,“ explained Amouranth</p>
<p>The streaming contract with Kick isn’t the only endeavor for the globally recognized streamer. Amouranth previously made headlines with unique broadcasts, as well as different investments. She is also famous for launching an AI version of herself along with the upcoming release of a beer that is made from her own body.</p>
<p>Back in October, Nick “NICKMERCS” Kolcheff, the famous Call of Duty streamer, announced his foray on Kick. The famous streamer, who also happens to be a co-owner of FaZe Clan, confirmed he signed a non-exclusive deal with the platform that rivals Twitch. Media reports at the time valued the deal at eight figures, meaning at least $10 million.</p>
