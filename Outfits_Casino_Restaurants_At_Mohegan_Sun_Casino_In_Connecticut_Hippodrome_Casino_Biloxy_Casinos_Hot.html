<p>One of the safest online casino brands, Wildz, has added to its live gaming library through a new partnership with Stakelogic Live, the dedicated live games development arm of the eponymous brand. Moving forward, The Rootz-owned will have access to a range of Stakelogic Live games, benefiting from thrilling and authentic live casino experience.</p>
<p>The partnership will see the integration of Stakelogic Live’s Chroma Key Studio which benefits businesses as well as players through its cost-efficient and easy deployment, and the huge branding capabilities and state-of-the-art products.</p>
<p>Wildz will be benefiting from a number of titles, including EuropeanRoulette, Absolutely Blackjack, and 7 Seat Blackjack to name a few, as the company strengthens its presence in the live casino offer, and will additionally garner access to other traditional games that will be strengthened by the Chroma Key Studio solution.</p>
<p>To liven up the live dealer experience, Stakelogic is also deploying the Super Stake feature, which will allow players to double their bet for a chance to trigger a Wheel of Chance-type of reward, which will spice up the gameplay and keep players entertained.</p>
<p>Rootz CEO Sam Brown has welcomed the opportunity to see one of the most prominent live dealer providers partner up with one of the company’s brands, further consolidating its status as a leading casino destination for thousands of players.</p>
<p>Brown was similarly stoked to leverage the Chroma Key Studio technology and ensure that Wildz can continue to differentiate its product offer by building custom and tailored solutions that bear its distinct brand features.</p>
<p>"This is one of our most important content integrations to date and we look forward to seeing our players sit down at Stakelogic Live tables to enjoy the immersive experiences on offer," the executive added.</p>
<p>The partnership was naturally welcomed by Stakelogic Live Head of Live Casino Dejan Loncar who said that the company was bringing a suite of unique live experiences to the Wildz’ shopping windows. Along with their stylish look and feel, the Stakelogic games are also empowered by such innovative designs and solutions as the Super Stake feature, Loncar added.</p>
