<p>White Hat Gaming’s US division White Hat Studios is expected to go live sometime during Q1 2022, and newly appointed Andy Withworth will be there to lead it to its success. Whitworth has been promoted as the new chief executive officer for the US segment, after having previously put his rich experience to work as a chief commercial officer for the company.</p>
<p>Why the Promotion Was Necessary</p>
<p>Whitworth joined White Hat in 2021 after a long and fruitful career in the gambling industry spread across 17 years. London-based Whitworth had numerous international jobs on all sides of the gambling world, ranging from brick-and-mortar to online casinos, gaming suppliers, content development, or sourcing.</p>
<p>He spent a year and a half as NetEnt’s chief strategy officer, managing director for the UK branch, and chief commercial officer for the American and the European divisions. He is also familiarized with Entain’s content, having worked there as head of content as well as commercial manager for casino prior to taking over the position of director of commercial management. Other positions include Tatts Groups’ head of gaming strategy as well as Scientific Games’ head of content strategy.</p>
<p>The US division he will be leading from his new position as a chief executive officer will benefit from his vast know-how and expertise. The division separated itself from the company’s original privileged access management platform soon after White Hat Gaming bought Blueprint Gaming’s gaming portfolio in 2021.</p>
<p>Ever since the division has been preparing to enter the US market and cater to the exact needs of American players. The incredibly fast speed at which the company has evolved made Whitworth’s selection and promotion are even more important. The best people that could build a leading White Hat Studios team were needed, and Whitworth ticked all the necessary boxes.</p>
<p>The US division that will launch sometime before March 31 aims to become one of the leading suppliers in the American market. To do this, it will use its top-tier content, flawless customer service solutions, and unparalleled gaming portfolio.</p>
<p>The portfolio includes White Hat’s successful in-house Jackpot Royale mechanic along with highly popular brands such as the recently added Deal or No Deal and Ted. The company remains confident in its ability to reach and exceed its goals and take the iGaming market in the US by storm with its highly flexible, safe, and scalable solutions for modular sportsbook and casino player account management.</p>
<p>Armen Tatarevic also joined the White Hat Studios American division team as the new account manager. His appointment followed the same need for a high-level team membership change in the context of the dynamic expansion of the platform.</p>
