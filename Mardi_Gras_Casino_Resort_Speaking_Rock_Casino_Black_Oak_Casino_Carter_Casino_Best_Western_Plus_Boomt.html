    <h1>Mardi Gras Casino Resort Speaking Rock Casino Black Oak Casino Carter Casino Best Western Plus Boomt</h1>

<p>Bitcasino continues to build up its public relations by adding more prominent people to its brand name. The latest representative for the growing iGaming brand that focuses on crypto gaming and zeroes wagering requirements is Augustine Miles Kelechi, a Nigerian musician known by the moniker of Tekno.</p>
<p>Spreading Bitcoin Through Music</p>
<p>The 29-year-old singer is going to help with Bitcasino’s efforts to grow and build its presence in West Africa and his musical performance will be a conduit for the brand’s marketing efforts. Tekno will be assisting Bitcasino over the next two years with something that the pair has described as a “true VIP experience.”</p>
<p>The artist will seek to help popularize the brand through this campaign which will focus on the “money-can’t-buy” experience that is yet to be determined. Some of those, though, include invitations to watch Premier League from an “executive box” that Bitcasino will take care of.</p>
<p>Bitcasino hopes that through Tekno it may reach new Nigerian customers and communicate a clear message – that Bitcasino is fun and a fair place to back a team if you are the gambling type. Tekno went further:</p>
<p>“Crypto is a game-changer, in West Africa and beyond, and I couldn’t be happier to work alongside the best crypto-led casino out there.” Bitcasino.io brand ambassador Augustine Miles Kelechi</p>
<p>Yolo Group (the entity which owns Bitcasino) director of casino Tauri Tiitsaar said that the team was very happy to welcome Tekno to its ambassador team.</p>
<p>Innovative Approach to Music and Gaming</p>
<p>He said that everybody in Yolo is a huge fan of the proactive and innovative music style Tekno had and that made him a good match for the Bitcasino brand. Tiitsaar added:</p>
<p>“Our goal is to bring crypto education closer to Tekno’s fans while also creating even more entertainment for our players through this exciting partnership.” Yolo Group director of casino Tauri Tiitsaar</p>
<p>Bitcasino is interested in the West African region as the use of cryptocurrency there has been soaring. Meanwhile, Bitcasino has been building its footprint elsewhere. The company signed a partnership with the 3Ice cup in Canada and the brand formed an alliance with Evil Geniuses, an esports team.</p>
