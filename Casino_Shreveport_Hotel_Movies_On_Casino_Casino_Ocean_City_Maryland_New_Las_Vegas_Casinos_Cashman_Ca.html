<p>Ruby Hunter review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Ruby Hunter, from font to fedora, is a female Indiana Jones complete with Dr Jones’ whip cracking lack of regard for the integrity of her archaeological finds.</p>
<p>If you are going to rip of a movie it does well to rip off a classic, and there are few movies more enthralling than Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p>
<p>Whether or not a slot can recapture that is a good question, but Ruby Hunter does its best.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Kalamba have a fantastic graphics department and as with most of their slots, Ruby Hunter is oozing with atmosphere and character. Each of the symbols is easily read, fits with the theme, and tells a little story of its own.</p>
<p>The sound effects are good, even going so far as to include a disappointed "Hmmm" from Ruby herself when the reels come up blank for you.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>To win yourself some treasure you just need to land the same symbol on consecutive reels starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>In Ruby Hunter, the base game is played on reels arranged in a 3-4-5-5-4-3 pattern. The anyway wins system, therefore, makes for 3600 win ways.</p>
<p>On top of the base game there is also a system of progressive Jackpots which are won by hitting a combination of Jackpot symbols and Wilds in the bonus round (full details below).</p>
<p>The jackpots combined take up 3.45% of each bet and are saved for each user at each bet level.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Jackpot and Bonus symbols.</p>
<p>Hitting three or more Bonus symbols triggers a round of free spins. Three symbols gets you eight free spins, while four, five or six symbols will get you twelve, fifteen or twenty spins respectively.</p>
<p>During the free spins Jackpot symbols are added to the reels. Hitting three or more Jackpot symbols triggers a Respin. During respins the regular payouts are paused. Instead the Jackpot symbols are locked in place. If you hit new Jackpot symbols during a respin they are locked in place and another respin is awarded.</p>
<p>When a respin occurs with no new Jackpot symbols, the symbols are counted up and if there are 15 or more one of the jackpots pays out.</p>
<p>15 - 19 symbols wins the Silver Jackpot, 20 - 23 gets you the Gold Jackpot and the Platinum Jackpot goes to anyone who hits 24+ Jackpot symbols during the respins. If the number of Jackpot symbols is fourteen or lower, the free spins resume.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.65%, an alright RTP in and of itself. Or if you chose to buy straight into the HyperBonus only it can be as high as 97.54% for the largest number of spins. This is much higher than our yardstick of ~96% for the industry average.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested was $/£/€0.60 to $/£/€600.00.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is very high, which is perfect for our preferred strategies. The higher the better in our book.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Ruby Hunter has it all: sass, good looks and a terrifying bull whip. More importantly the slot machine that takes her name has a decent RTP and volatility and a thrilling jackpot feature.</p>
<p>We can recommend it, especially to those with the bankrolls to make playing the bonus game exclusively a viable option.</p>
