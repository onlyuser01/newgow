<p>The leading global lottery games and technology provider, Scientific Games, announced a partnership extension with the Colorado Lottery. The company said Thursday it will take its existing collaboration with the Lottery in the state to a new level, via its Scientific Games Enhanced Partnership (SGEP) program.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Scientific Games will help increase the contributions to Colorado's schools, trails and parks among other public areas. Additionally, the new partnership will result in the creation of jobs for a new office which will be located near Colorado Lottery's headquarters in Lakewood.</p>
<p>In a statement released on August 18, 2022, Scientific Games' President, Americas and Global Instant Products, John Schulz, said: "This is an exciting opportunity for the Colorado Lottery and Scientific Games teams to expand our work together to entertain players and benefit environmental and education programs in the state."</p>
<p>Besides the SGEP program, the extended collaboration between the duo includes Scientific Games'leading retail technology called SCiQ. As a result, 500 SCiQ units will be delivered to Colorado Lottery retail locations, According to the SG, the groundbreaking technology will "give the Lottery and its retailers unprecedented, real-time visibility and control of instant game inventory in individual stores."</p>
<p>What's more, the leading retail technology will ease the Lottery and retailers' accounting and operational processes. On that topic, Schulz said the company is looking forward to the success the new partnership will bring with the SGEP partnership and the leading SCiQ technology.</p>
<p>The extended partnership between Scientific Games and the Colorado Lottery builds upon a strong foundation. In fact, the duo first joined forces nearly four decades ago. Now, the new program will undoubtedly bring further benefits to the Colorado Lottery.</p>
<p>Thanks to the SGEP program, the Lottery will leverage "world-leading instant game design and portfolio management services," Scientific Games explained. The Lottery will also benefit from tools related to analytics, logistics, marketing as well as license brand services.</p>
<p>But it's not only the Colorado Lottery that enjoys the benefits of the SGEP program. La Fleur's 2022 World Lottery Almanac reveals that seven out of the Top 10 performing instant game providers in the world leverage the leading program.</p>
<p>Tom Seaver, the Colorado Lottery's Director, who has more than 30 years of leadership experience in the lottery industry, commented on the topic. He outlined that the Lottery remains committed to offering responsible entertainment via Scratch game products that bring enjoyment to the players. At the same time, he pointed out that those products bring returns to good causes in the state. In conclusion, Seaver revealed: "This contract extension with Scientific Games will bring operational efficiencies to the Lottery and our retailers."</p>
