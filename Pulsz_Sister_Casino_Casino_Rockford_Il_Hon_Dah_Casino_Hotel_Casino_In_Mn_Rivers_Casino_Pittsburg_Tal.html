<p>Talking Stick Resort and Casino Arizona have been named the official casino partners of the Arizona Diamondbacks. This expands the partnership agreement between the team and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community which owns the two venues.</p>
<p>The Casinos Join the Diamondbacks as Partners</p>
<p>As per the deal, the Diamondbacks, a professional baseball team, will promote their partner’s brands. Following the agreement, the MLB franchise will feature the logos of Talking Stick and Casino Arizona across its home stadium, Chase Field. The two partners will also create a new VIP lounge which will be located behind the visitor’s dugout at the stadium.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Arizona Diamondbacks will also support upcoming tribal events such as the Native American Inter-Tribal Baseball and Softball Tournament and Native American Recognition Day. The events will take place on May 25 and May 29 respectively.</p>
<p>The agreement builds on the Diamondbacks’ existing partnership with the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. Thanks to its relationship with the tribe, the MLB team has a spring training facility in its territory. The so-called Salt River Fields is the first such training field to ever appear on Native American land.</p>
<p>The Deal between the Tribe and the Diamondbacks Is Something Special</p>
<p>Derrick Hall, the president and chief executive officer of the Arizona Diamondbacks, spoke about the agreement. He shared that he is thrilled to see Talking Stick and Casino Arizona join the MLB franchise’s family.</p>
<p>Hall also added that the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is one of the team’s most valued and long-term partners. Because of this, he is happy about the opportunity to grow the relationship between the Diamondbacks and the tribe.</p>
<p>Hall hopes that the two parties will be able to create memorable experiences for the visitors of Chase Field and that the partnership will prove profitable for the tribe.</p>
<p>Ramon Martinez, the director of public relations for Talking Stick Resort and Casino Arizona, also shared his thoughts. He said that the venues always look for partners who share the same core values. According to Martinez, the Diamondbacks are precisely one such partner. When talking about the D-backs, the director lauded the franchise’s passion and its commitment to the fanbase:</p>
<p>Over the course of our lengthy relationship with the Arizona Diamondbacks, they have demonstrated a true commitment to their fans and the greater community. Ramon Martinez, director public relations, Talking Stick Resort and Casino Arizona</p>
<p>The deal between the Diamondbacks and Talking Stick reaffirms the casino’s love for professional sports. In February, Talking Stick Resort became the official sponsor of the WM Phoenix Open professional golf tournament.</p>
