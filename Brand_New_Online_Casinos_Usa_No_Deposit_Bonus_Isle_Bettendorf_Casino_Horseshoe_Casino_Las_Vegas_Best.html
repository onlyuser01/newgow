<p>PSG have spent just under $1.4 billion on signings since Qatar Sports Investments took over the club in 2011. Since then, the team’s won almost everything, but there’s one trophy that’s still missing from PSG’s cabinet – the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for their fans, it seems as if they’ll have to wait at least another year to get ahold of it. The thing is that after losing 1-0 at home to Bayern Munich in the first leg of the UCL Round of 16, their chances of advancing forward look slim. In fact, most online sportsbooks are giving +450 on PSG qualifying for the next stage.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich Plan to Stay Unbeaten at Home</p>
<p>It was January 7, 2022, when Bayern Munich lost a home game the last time. It happened in the Bundesliga, while their undefeated home run in the Champions League is even longer. They’re without a single UCL loss at Allianz Arena since April 7, 2021. What’s got to worry them is that the team that beat them in that game is PSG.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich conceded three goals that day and they need to be worried about the same happening again. The thing is that they’re going to be without several important defenders on Wednesday. Benjamin Pavard, for instance, will miss the game because of suspension. Lucas Hernandez is injured, while Noussair Mazraoui is out due to heart problems.</p>
<p>When it comes to their offense, however, everything seems to be in order. In fact, we could finally see Sadio Mane start a game. The former Liverpool star had to spend more than three months off the pitch due to a muscle injury, but he did make his return two weeks ago, albeit spending only a limited time on the pitch.</p>
<p>PSG to Attack With All They Got</p>
<p>They’re 1-0 down on aggregate, meaning that their only option is to go for a win. And in order to do that, they need to score. Scoring one goal would only take the game to an extra time/penalty shootout. If they want to advance to the next phase of the Champions League, PSG needs to beat Bayern by at least two goals.</p>
<p>Knowing that Bayern players almost always score on home turf, PSG will probably have to aim for a very high number of goals. Luckily for them, they definitely have the manpower to outscore literally any opponent in the world.</p>
<p>The bad news for them is that Neymar is out, but that shouldn’t matter much if Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi show up on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs PSG Prediction</p>
<p>One thing looks almost 100% certain – Bayern Munich vs PSG is going to be a goal-fest. Both teams are incredibly powerful in the offense, so anything but goals galore would be a shock.</p>
<p>But who’s going to get to the quarterfinal of the Champions League? We think it’s gonna be the home team. At Allianz Arena, Bayern are undefeated for more than a year and we think that won’t change on March 8.</p>
<p>Pick: Bayern Munich and PSG to draw; over 3.5 goals</p>
