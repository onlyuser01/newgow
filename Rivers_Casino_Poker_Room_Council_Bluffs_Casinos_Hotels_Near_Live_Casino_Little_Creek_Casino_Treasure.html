    <h1>Rivers Casino Poker Room Council Bluffs Casinos Hotels Near Live Casino Little Creek Casino Treasure</h1>

<p>The bonus was 100% of the deposit amount. The bonus wagering progress is not visible in the Casinos account. I certainly bet the 400 euros more than 40 times. I communicated with the live chat and they said that it should have been updated and that they were going to send the problem to the update department, but until it ran out I didn't get any response.</p>
<p>but the strange thing is that when I loaded the 400 euros, the amount remained the same. It has not been increased to 800 euros. I was playing, I had about 200 euros, I got a jackpot of 5000 euros on the rhino old and win slot. I was left with around 5700 euros in the real money account. I stopped playing and left the casino. About an hour later, I entered the casino and to my amazement: the money the country had in the real money account was at zero and had all been transferred to the bonus account. Meanwhile I continued to play and won another jackpot of 10000 euros in the same slot. I currently have 13000 euros. I've certainly met the bonus requirements. By the way, when I made the deposit, they asked me to enter the bonus code, but I didn't enter any code. I was never credited the 400 bonus. I can't understand why all the money is in the bonus account. Help me please. Grateful</p>
