<p>Dear celinecel,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. I have checked the casino’s website for options to close an account and unsubscribe from all correspondence with the casino and its services, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>Temporarily disable your account with self-exclusion</p>
<p>If you feel you need an even strong disincentive to play, or would like greater control over the urge to gamble, you can temporarily deactivate your account by using our self-exclusion option.</p>
<p>When you place yourself on the self-exclusion list at the casino you will be unable to log in, fun your account, withdraw funds or play any games.</p>
<p>Like with the cooling off period you can choose how long to self-exclude yourself and the periods available range from one week to 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or even permanently in extreme cases.</p>
<p>At the end of your self-exclusion period you will need to contact our support team to regain full functionality of your account.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings Casino Rocket,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@casinorocket.com (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
