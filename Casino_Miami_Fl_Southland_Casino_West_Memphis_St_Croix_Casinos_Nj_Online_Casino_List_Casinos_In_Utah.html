<p>Champion League Betting: Liverpool Stuns Barcelona with Miracle Semifinal Comeback</p>

<p>Liverpool needed a miracle to overturn a three-goal first-leg deficit against Barcelona in its Champions League semifinal on Tuesday night, and guess what?</p>
<p>Match Hero: Gini Wijnaldum falls to his knees as Liverpool record a shock 4-0 victory against mighty Barcelona, the minimum requirement to progress to the Champions League final (Image: CBS Sports)</p>
<p>The EPL team staged arguably its most stunning comeback on the European stage, beating the world’s top-ranked club side, Barcelona, to advance into the final for the second year in a row. And we say “arguably” because there have been a few stunning comebacks over the years.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget Liverpool were once 3-0 down in a Champions League final, in 2005 against A.C. Milan and somehow managed to win that one too.</p>
<p>But this seemed even more impressive. This was Barcelona. While somehow Barca had managed to win the first leg 3-0 while being the worse team, the bookies felt a turnaround was a tall order for a Liverpool team that would be missing its two best players, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, through injury.</p>
<p>Liverpool would need to score four and also prevent Barcelona scoring – a team that sometimes scores for fun.</p>
<p>Before the match, Bet365 had the odds of the EPL side progressing to the final at 18/1 and the exact final score of 4-0 at 55/1.</p>
<p>Swarm of Red</p>
<p>We said the difference between the two sides last time was Lionel Messi’s genius. This time, genius wasn’t quite enough to overcome the pure motivation of a Liverpool team that refused to give up, and went for Barca, attacking in a swarm of red.</p>
<p>The first goal, in the sixth minute rattled Barcelona. For Liverpool, the impossible now became merely very unlikely, and belief surged through the team.</p>
<p>The tie was turned completely on its head within the space of just two minutes in the second half, when Gini Wijnaldum, a substitute, scored a brace and became the hero of the night.</p>
<p>With the scores now level, the momentum was with the English side, although Barca were now spurred into action, forcing Liverpool keeper Alisson to make some big saves as his team defended with heart.</p>
<p>Liverpool Now Heavy Favorite</p>
<p>Liverpool’s match-winner, from a corner, was creative and impudent. Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared to be walking away from the corner spot as Xherdan Shaqiri strode up to take it. But as Barcelona switched off, Alexander-Arnold switched on.</p>
<p>Spotting Divock Origi unmarked in the box he darted back to the ball and fired it across to a grateful Origi, who made no mistake in scoring his second of the night.</p>
<p>Spurs and Ajax play later on Wednesday in the second semifinal with Ajax holding a 1-0 lead and a precious away goal.</p>
<p>But Liverpool has become the bookies favorite to win the Champions League, and on this evidence it’s difficult to see who’s going to stop it.</p>
