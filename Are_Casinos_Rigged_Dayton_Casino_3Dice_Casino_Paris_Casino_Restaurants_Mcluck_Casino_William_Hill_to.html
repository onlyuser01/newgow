    <h1>Are Casinos Rigged Dayton Casino 3Dice Casino Paris Casino Restaurants Mcluck Casino William Hill to</h1>

<p>Evolution has entered into a pivotal partnership with William Hill to roll out its suite of live casino solutions across the United States.</p>
<p>Evolution’s U.S. Pivot Continues with William Hill Deal</p>
<p>Heavyweight live casino vendor Evolution has entered into a new growth opportunity with William Hill, announcing a pending launch of the company’s live products and services on the operator’s digital skins in the United States. The partnership covers the entire country, and will be available in every market where William Hill currently holds a license to operate iGaming products.</p>
<p>Evolution will be rolling out its first product in New Jersey, with the company’s native Atlantic City’s studio spearheading the move. More states will be added to the list in the future, the press release said.</p>
<p>William Hill US currently owns the largest number of venues authorized to accept wagers with some 113 race and sports businesses nationwide. The company has expanded its footprint in key jurisdictions, including Florida, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Johan Nordstrom, chief executive and chief commercial officer at Evolution Malta lauded the partnership. Evolution was proud and excited to have been selected by William Hill US, he added.</p>
<p>The companies have already explored a similar business narrative back in Europe where Evolution’s live products have been essential in helping William Hill develop its momentum in the vertical. Nordstrom added:</p>
<p>“We very much look forward to achieving the same high levels of success for William Hill in the United States.” Evolution Chief Commercial Officer Johan Nordstrom</p>
<p>Growth Opportunities Abound in the Gambling Industry</p>
<p>The iGaming industry has seen tectonic shifts recently, with both Evolution and William Hill at the crux of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) over the past months. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. made an offer to buy out William Hill PLC early in September, which has been welcomed by shareholders and senior management.</p>
<p>The deal was valued at £2.9 billion or approximately $3.70 billion at the time. William Hill has quickly scaled its portfolio and market scope in the United States since sports betting was legalized in 2018.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Evolution has been looking to consolidate its own footprint, signing a partnership with BetMGM. The company’s profit increased 97.5% year-over-year (YOY) in the H1 2020, and Evolution moved in to buy out NetEnt for £1.68 billion, the leading developer of casino gamification solutions.</p>
<p>Evolution Gaming is pivoting its strategy for the United States with foresight in mind. During the H1 2020 earnings call, Evolution CEO Martin Carlesund said that Evolution is currently expanding its capacity by adding more live studios to meet local and domestic demand.</p>
<p>Presently, the company hires 8,000 employees and runs 8 live studios. Evolution is moving in with a project to launch a new studio in Pennsylvania later this year or next. The company has 12 live games planned for the year, eight of which already rolled out on the company’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Outlining Evolution’s ambitions for the future, Carlesund concluded that the company would strive to become a defining B2B online casino provider.</p>
