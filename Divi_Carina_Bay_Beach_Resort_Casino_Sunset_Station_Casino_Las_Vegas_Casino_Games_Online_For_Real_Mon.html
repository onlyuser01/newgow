    <h1>Divi Carina Bay Beach Resort Casino Sunset Station Casino Las Vegas Casino Games Online For Real Mon</h1>

<p>Hello casino guru,</p>
<p>On 01/27/23 I made 2 deposits with giropay (via AstroPay) at "Wizebets" Casino: 200E and 400E. Since AstroPay had problems again, the money didn't go through and I had to wait until Monday because there are no bank working days on the weekend .No problem.</p>
<p>On Monday noon the money was transferred from AstroPay to Wizebets Casino. However, until today the money has not been credited to my Wizebets account. According to daily e-mails it says:</p>
<p>-It's being checked, our finance department has to clarify it, it's being processed. The last email was 15 minutes ago and it literally said: "Hello! Deposits at the monitoring station. Don't worry.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>VIP Department WizeBets Casino"</p>
<p>A transfer usually takes 2 minutes. I don't know what they are doing with my money. Maybe they can help me. That would be nice.</p>
<p>Attached you will find the transfers from my bank and from AstroPay.</p>
