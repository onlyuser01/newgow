<p>The fast-growing supplier of content, powering online gambling operators, EGT Digital, announced a new European-facing deal. The company revealed Monday that its popular games will be able to reach new players thanks to a partnership with Betsson Group. The strategic collaboration will see EGT Digital's content bolster the offering of www.rizk.hr, a leading online casino in Croatia.</p>
<p>As a result of the new deal, customers of the operator will be able to tap into quality titles delivered by EGT Digital. Such games include fan-favorite Clover Chance, Bell Link, High Cash and Single Progressive, which have already gone live with the Croatian online operator.</p>
<p>Strengthening RIZK's offering is only one side of the new partnership. EGT Digital will also benefit from the collaboration by engaging with new players and delivering its exceptional games. Moreover, the deal will grow the operator's foothold on the Old Continent.</p>
<p>Božo Matić, the Country Manager at Betsson Croatia, shared that the company is excited about the new partnership with EGT Digital. In a statement, he explained: "As a leading online casino, we must always keep up with the trends and offer the most innovative and attractive gaming content." Finally, Matić said: "EGT Digital’s titles immediately caught our customers’ attention and they are currently among the most played slots on our site."</p>
<p>Tsvetomira Drumeva, EGT Digital's Head of Sales, shared the positive vibe, adding that EGT Digital is delighted and proud to join forces with Betsson for the market in Croatia. Finally, she said: "The Croatian market has great potential for our slots, which are already well-known here, and this collaboration will help us increase our popularity among the local gaming audience and establish ourselves as one of the preferred gaming software providers."</p>
<p>Recently, EGT Digital announced another deal, growing its European footprint. Earlier this month, the company joined forces with Microgame, agreeing to deliver its games. Under the terms of that agreement, EGT Digital will leverage Microgame's extensive partner network, expanding the reach of its titles.</p>
