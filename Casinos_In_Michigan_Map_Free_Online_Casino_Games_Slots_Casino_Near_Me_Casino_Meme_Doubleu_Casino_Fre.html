    <h1>Casinos In Michigan Map Free Online Casino Games Slots Casino Near Me Casino Meme Doubleu Casino Fre</h1>

<p>iGaming provider of software, content, and services aimed at casinos, sports betting platforms, payment services, and affiliate/agent management solutions to operators EveryMatrix has finally received the green light from the Michigan Gaming Control Board. The provider originally applied for a license to operate in the state earlier this year, looking to strengthen its foothold in the US while expanding its reach in the iGaming vertical. EveryMatrix has finally received conditional approval to distribute its content using its CasinoEngine integration platform.</p>
<p>CasinoEngine Offers Access to 12,500+ Games</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine platform is home to the most generous library paced with casino content in the industry. It currently gives operators access to more than 12,500 games from over 250 casino vendors and sub-vendors. Its enhanced modularity features allow easy integration with third-party platforms. The EveryMatrix platform is also highly scalable and fully compliant, enabling operators to easily select their preferred solutions based on their exact necessities and the current existing technologies they are using.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix Americas’ president Erik Nyman spoke about the state of Michigan and its “solid framework” dedicated to iGaming that has been delivering “strong results” since the official opening of the market Nyman expressed his delight for the company being granted the license approval for its iGaming content distribution in the state while looking forward to going live with their customers.</p>
<p>More Jurisdictions to Come</p>
<p>New Jersey and West Virginia are other US states where EveryMatrix recorded success in receiving a license for content distribution. More jurisdictions are on the list for the company with more than 700 employees spread across ten countries who cater to the needs of over 200 global customers. A member of the European Lotteries Association, the iDea growth in the US, and the World Lottery Association, the provider is known for empowering its clients to deliver outstanding experiences in regulated markets.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, EveryMatrix signed a content partnership agreement with Playgon Games, getting ready to leverage the latter’s products via the CasinoEngine platform. In the previous month, the company added 3 Oaks Gaming to its list of partners along with Stakelogic. EveryMatrix will get to use Stakelogic Live’s content and solutions through a complete integration of the former’s portfolio into EveryMatrix’s CasinoEngine. In return, this will significantly speed up the integration with the iGaming platforms of existing partner operators worldwide. Stakelogic will feature its live VIP roulette and blackjack tables, and a series of traditional table games as a result of the new agreement deal.</p>
