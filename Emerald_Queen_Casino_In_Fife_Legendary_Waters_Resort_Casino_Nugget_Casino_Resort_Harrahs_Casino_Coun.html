<p>LSports, a leading innovative sports betting data provider, has entered a 5-year strategic partnership with The American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) and UltiX Technology for data distribution and co-development and to enter the North American market. SCCG Management was the one who introduced the two parties.</p>
<p>LSports CEO Dotan Lazar said that the company is well-known for its real-time data solutions, pre-match, in-play odds, and betting simulations. He stated that LSports had been looking for a suitable collaborator in North America. He said that with its 139 live events and 22 teams, AUDL provides the perfect launching pad.</p>

<p>Through their collaboration, LSports will work hand-in-hand with UltiX to “develop and deliver the world’s first predictive betting algorithms and AI-designed solutions specifically for the sport of Ultimate.”</p>
<p>Under the $3 million deal, LSports would gain the title “Official Data Partner of the AUDL”. The company will have exclusive rights over the distribution of AUDL Official Data, its network of land-based and online betting partners worldwide, and its enhanced betting solutions.</p>
<p>The algorithms, launching for the 2022 AUDL season, will provide the betting industry with new betting solutions and engaging data sets.</p>
<p>SCCG Management Will Run the Data’s Sales and Distribution</p>
<p>AUDL CEO and Commissioner Steve Hall said that the league couldn’t have found a better partner to achieve their data goals. He stated that combining data, media, gaming assets, and technology is the key strategy to gain more popularity for the sport and boost fan-base. He said that LSports are innovative, determined, and share their the league’s vision of the sport’s value worldwide.</p>
<p>SCCG Management Founder Stephen Crystal said that the company is happy to have participated in the introduction of the two parties. The company will run the sales and distribution of data, which will be the end product of the collaboration. He believes in the partnership’s success and thinks that the action sport will gain worldwide recognition in the betting industry.</p>
<p>Last year SCCG partnered up with Sporting Solutions, as the latter enters the North American market to supply US operators with fully automated solutions for pricing and risk management.</p>
<p>Lazar stated that SCCG Management would help meet the growing sports betting partners’ demand for more action and high-scoring team sports worldwide.</p>
