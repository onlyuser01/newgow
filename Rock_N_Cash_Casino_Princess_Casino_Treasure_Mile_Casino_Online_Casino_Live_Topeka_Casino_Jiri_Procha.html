<p>Jiri Prochazka vs. Alex Pereira is the battle for the UFC Light Heavyweight championship. Prochazka is a former champ who had to vacate his title due to an injury.

<p>Prochazka Planning a Spectacle for His UFC Homecoming</p>
<p>Jiri Prochazka (29-3-1) last fought in July 2022, when we saw him defeat Glover Teixeira in a battle for the 205lb crown. It was a strange fight, which the BJJ genius was winning until 4:32 left on the clock in the fifth round.</p>
<p>Glover, who had previously already made four takedowns on Prochazka, decided to go for another one. He took the Czech fighter down and tried to submit him, but everything went horribly wrong for the Brazilian veteran. Prochazka outsmarted him and beat him with his own weapon ‚Äì a rear naked choke.</p>

<p>It was only the third win by submission for Prochazka, who prefers to finish his fights with KO/TKO. In fact, he‚Äôs got a knockout-to-win percentage of 86.20%.</p>
<p>He loves punching and kicking his opponents, but that might not work on November 11. Why? Because his opponent is one of the best kickboxers on the planet, Alex Pereira.</p>
<p>Is Alex Pereira Powerful Enough for the 205lb Division?</p>
<p>Alex Pereira is a former Glory kickboxing champion of the world, who‚Äôs 8-2 since switching to mixed martial arts. He joined the UFC in 2021, where he was the Middleweight champion at one point.</p>
<p>After losing the championship belt to his old foe Israel Adesanya, he decided to move up a division. It was July 29 this year when he made his UFC Light Heavyweight debut.</p>
<p>He fought Jan Blachowicz and won by a split decision. It was a close fight, in which Pereira landed 18 significant strikes more than his opponent, but those weren‚Äôt powerful enough to turn the lights off for the Polish fighter. The fight also saw Blachowicz ragdoll Pereira, taking him down on three occasions.</p>
<p>Jiri Prochazka vs. Alex Pereira Prediction</p>
<p>Prochazka might not be as quick as Pereira but he‚Äôs way more powerful. Plus, even though he‚Äôs not an elite wrestler/grappler, he is much better at those things than the Brazilian.</p>
<p>We think he‚Äôs gonna use that to get his UFC Light Heavyweight championship belt back. He‚Äôs going to take Poatan down to the floor and finish him either by ground-and-pound or submission.</p>
<p>Pick: Jiri Prochazka to win by finish</p>
