    <h1>Vip Slots Casino How Many Casinos In Atlantic City Casino 1995 Resort World Casino Las Vegas Casino</h1>

<p>Caesars Entertainment Inc. officially launched today its referendum campaign regarding the casino in Danville, Virginia. Danville residents will have a chance to vote yes for the $400 million premier resort and casino during the upcoming referendum in November after the City Council of Danville passed a resolution to petition the court for the inclusion of the casino vote in the ballot.</p>
<p>Huge Benefits for the City and Its Residents</p>
<p>“Caesars for Danville” referendum campaign and committee is marking another step in the development of Caesars Virginia, the premier casino resort the largest casino and entertainment company in the US is seeking to build. Expected to bring 900 construction and 1,300 operational jobs and over $34 million per year in gaming tax revenue for the city, the casino project will create a tourism engine for the city and the region.</p>
<p>“Caesars Entertainment has a long history of enriching the communities we serve, whether that be through our commitment to social responsibility or through our proven record of creating exhilarating experiences at our world-class resorts.” Anthony Carano, President and COO, Caesars Entertainment, Inc.</p>
<p>The development, if approved at the November vote, is planned to break ground in late 2021 or early 2022, and will transform the old Dan River Mills Schoolfield site. The resort will comprise of 300 hotel rooms, a 2,500-seat theatre for live entertainment, 35,000 square feet of convention space, full-service spa, pool, bars and restaurants. The world-class casino gaming floor will feature 2,000 slot machines, 75 table games and 16 poker tables, as well as a sportsbook.</p>
<p>Delegate Danny Marshall, one of 4 co-chairs of the “Caesars for Danville” committee who will advise and support the campaign and its efforts for a successful passage, outlined that the creation of a world-class resort in Danville would be the next step for economic revitalization, and the transformation the project would bring deserves the public support.</p>
<p>The other co-chair of the committee, Mayor Alonzo Jones, highlighted that a once-in-a lifetime opportunity like this that would bring life back into an old industrial site cannot be let pass by, asking his fellow Danville residents to join him in his yes vote.</p>
<p>Dr. Tiffany Franks of Averett University added that the project would create opportunities for collaboration between the university and Caesars Entertainment, providing students with internships that would lead to fulfilling careers in Danville.</p>
<p>Tammy Wright-Warren, a minority investor in the project, emphasized Caesars’ strong record of lifting up small businesses in areas where they operate, particularly those owned by women or minorities, a trait that makes the casino operator the kind of partner for Danville and the area.</p>
<p>“We look forward to partnering with Danville on Caesars Virginia, and we are grateful for the overwhelming support we have seen thus far on this thrilling investment into the city. The endorsement from such respected members of the community is humbling, and we sincerely thank Dr. Franks, Mayor Jones, Delegate Marshall and Ms. Wright-Warren for their work to make Caesars Virginia in Danville a reality come November.” Tony Rodio, Strategic Adviser, Caesars Entertainment Inc.</p>
