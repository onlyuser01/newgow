<p>Aztec Ascent review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Aztec Ascent is themed around Aztec aesthetics and culture.</p>
<p>In the steamy heat of the jungle, players will find themselves standing before an ancient Aztec pyramid. Inside, they'll find mysterious symbols in jewel-tone hues.</p>
<p>This game definitely leans into a South American fantasy rather than reality, but this is part of the exotic fun.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a tribal-style song filled with steel drums and flutes. The music creates the atmosphere of a resort theatre production with plenty of drama.</p>
<p>The reels are crafted from stone blocks that bring to mind the iconic pyramids that the Aztec people left behind. Inside, stylised animal symbols are rendered in bright colours. The quality of the animation is decent, and closer inspection of the symbols reveals ornate designs.</p>
<p>Golden statues of a jaguar and a bird stand guard on either side of the reels. They add a majestic reverence to the setting, suggesting that this place could be sacred.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see dense jungle foliage and a vast blue sky. The weather seems warm, and it won’t be difficult for players to imagine they have climbed through rugged terrain to reach this point.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Aztec Ascent is a six reel, four row slot with 40 win lines.</p>
<p>The pace of the gameplay is swift, ensuring that players will stay engaged.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is no Wild symbol in this game.</p>
<p>Relic Random feature is awarded at random at the start of a spin. During this feature, a multiplier of x100 is activated while between 1 and 4 high paying symbols are transformed into mystery symbols.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Free Spin symbols. The number of free spins awarded depends on how many Free Spin symbols initiated the feature:</p>
<p>3 Free Spin symbols – 8 free spins</p>
<p>4 Free Spin symbols –10 free spins</p>
<p>5 Free Spin symbols –12 free spins</p>
<p>6 Free Spin symbols – 15 free spins</p>
<p>Collection symbols can appear on other symbols in the form of either red or blue jewels. Should players complete their collection of red jewels, the win multiplier will be upgraded, potentially up to x100.</p>
<p>If players complete their collection of blue jewels, high paying symbols will transform into Mystery symbols, increasing the number of Mystery symbols on the reels overall.</p>
<p>Mystery symbols themselves transform to match each other, increasing potential wins.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.37%, just above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€10.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility Aztec-themed slot.</p>
<p>The strategy-ready volatility and respectable RTP make this game a good choice for savvy players.</p>
<p>The South American setting is a fun escape and will especially appeal to lovers of exotically themed slots.</p>
