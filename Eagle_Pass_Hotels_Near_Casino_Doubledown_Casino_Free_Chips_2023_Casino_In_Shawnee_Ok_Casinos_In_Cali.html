<p>The leading provider of online casino games and innovative gambling products, Amusnet, announced a new partnership, growing its European-facing presence. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it joined forces with the leading platform and games provider, SpinOro. Under the terms of the new strategic collaboration, Amusnet agreed to deliver its games, growing the offering of SpinOro's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>The deal represents an important achievement for the iGaming content supplier as it enables its thrilling games to reach new players. Moreover, the collaboration strengthens Amusnet's presence in Spain, allowing its quality titles to engage with new customers via SpinOro's extensive partner network.</p>
<p>Many of the iGaming provider's games have already been recognized in different markets across the globe with their unique themes, engaging features and thrilling gameplay. Yet, through the latest agreement, Amusnet further expands on the Old Continent, solidifying its position as a leading supplier for the online gambling sector.</p>
<p>Jeff Letlat, SpinOro's COO, commented on the topic in a statement. "Partnering with Amusnet is a major achievement for SpinOro, aligning seamlessly with our vision to offer a next-level gaming experience," he explained. Finally, Letlat outlined: "We are highly confident that Amusnetâ€™s outstanding gaming offerings will not merely meet but surpass player expectations, generating increased interest among our Spanish partners."</p>
<p>Edwin Cruz, Amusnet Spain's Managing Director, shared the positive vibe about the latest strategic integration. "This partnership marks a significant milestone as we continue our expansion in Spain," he explained. Finally, Cruz said: "By extending our engaging content to SpinOro's local clients, we are strengthening Amusnet's position as a key player in the rapidly evolving Spanish gaming market."</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Gratogana.es players can already enjoy some of the most popular and fan-favorite titles from Amusnet. Such include 20 Golden Coins, 40 Super Hot, Burning Hot, 100 Super Hot, as well as Shining Crown, among others.</p>
<p>Overall, nearly 100 games from the iGaming supplier will reach new players via the integration with SpinOro's aggregation platform. While the partnership propels Amusnet's reach, it also significantly grows the aggregation platform's offering, making it more appealing to online gambling operators in the region.</p>
