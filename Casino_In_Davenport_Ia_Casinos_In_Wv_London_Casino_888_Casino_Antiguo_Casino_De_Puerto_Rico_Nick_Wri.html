<p>Blueprint Gaming, a leading developer of slot games, has introduced a new addition to its leadership team, naming the experienced Nick Wright as its new chief commercial officer. The new hire will strengthen the company’s leadership, allowing it to double down on its goals.</p>
<p>The hire’s appointment comes as Blueprint Gaming continues to grow its product portfolio and platform capabilities.</p>
<p>In his new position, Wright will oversee Blueprint Gaming’s growth strategy in the United Kingdom and beyond. He will be tasked with growing the company and exploring opportunities for launches in new regulated markets.</p>
<p>Wright is an iGaming industry veteran with years of experience in the sector. His experience, Blueprint Gaming noted, “stretches back to the emergence of online gaming.” In addition, Wright boasts tenures at some of the most influential gaming companies.</p>
<p>Prior to his current job at Blueprint Gaming, Wright served as the senior vice president of commercial content at Bally’s Corporation. Before that, he worked as group head of business development of Gamesys, now a Bally’s subsidiary.</p>
<p>Wright has also worked in senior positions at other iGaming brands, such as Amaya Gaming and Playtech.</p>
<p>The Hire Is Excited to Join Blueprint Gaming</p>
<p>Wright commented on his new position, expressing his excitement to join Blueprint Gaming. He lauded the company as a “well-established business” and praised its “ambitious and fun-loving team.”</p>
<p>Wright noted that he has known some of Blueprint’s leaders for years and is familiar with the company’s dedication to quality. He concluded that he is looking forward to lending his expertise to the team.</p>
<p>It feels great to be bringing my expertise to support such a successful commercial team both in the UK and on some really interesting international growth projects. I can’t wait to be working with so many of the world’s biggest and best operators. Nick Wright, CCO, Blueprint Gaming</p>
<p>Matt Cole, Blueprint Gaming’s managing director, welcomed Wright to the Blueprint family, expressing his team’s excitement to have “such a well-respected individual” on board.</p>
<p>Nick’s operational experience with some of the industry’s biggest brands will be hugely beneficial to Blueprint. As we step up our efforts to simultaneously support our established partners and extend our International reach, we have built a team that is capable of achieving our targets.
