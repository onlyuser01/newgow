<p>The fast-growing Asian sports betting operator and powerhouse, Fun88, expanded its roster of brand ambassadors by joining forces with Tony Parker, the famous Hall of Famer and recognizable NBA superstar.

<p>Commenting on the topic, Parker said that he is thrilled to join Fun88 as a brand ambassador after the company previously joined forces with Kobe and Steve. “They have built a brand here which directly aligns with my playing values of speed and strength, underpinned by a desire to operate as a team and confound the critics,” he added.</p>

<p>Fun88’s new brand ambassador said that he is looking forward to delivering unique and engaging insights, as well as premium content for bettors and sports fans across Asian markets. “From China to Thailand, these fans are making it rain! Hopefully, we can find some innovative offers and deeper connections for players to better engage with the sports they love,” explained Parker in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We’re naturally delighted to have secured further net gains for Fun88’s unrivalled ambassadorial roster by signing Tony,“ explained a representative for Fun88</p>
