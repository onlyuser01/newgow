<p>Shay Ben-Yitzhak Dies in a Plane Crash</p>
<p>888 co-founder, Shay Ben-Yitzhak, aged 52, died on Saturday in Sharon, Israel, after a private plane he and his 11-year-old son had boarded crashed, The Times of Israel reported. The accident unfolded minutes after takeoff, with the plane nose diving back to the ground, according to witness account.</p>
<p>Firefighters and ambulances arrived on sight and launched a rescue operation. Danny Yosefsberg of the Netanya Fire and Rescue Department explained that the operation took firefighters time, because the plane’s fuel had spilled around, limiting access to the aircraft.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, by the time the crews reached Mr Ben-Yitzhak, he had passed away. His son, however, was alive and he was airlifted to a hospital, having sustained serious injuries. Investigations into the crash continues, but experts seem to favor the theory provided by eye witnesses, i.e. that the plane nose dived into the ground.</p>
<p>Who Is Ben-Yitzhak and What Was His Role in 888?</p>
<p>Shay Ben-Yitzhak is brother to Ron Ben-Yitzhak, two of the original 888 founders. In 1997, the pair pooled their efforts with Aaron and Avi Shaked, also brothers, and formed what would later be 888 Holdings.</p>
<p>At the time, the company was known as Casino-on-Net. 888 Holdings quickly progressed to become one of the world’s largest online gaming companies, expanding into multiple verticals including poker, casino and sports betting.</p>
<p>Shay Ben-Yitzhak first worked as software engineer for Tower Semiconductor Limited and his brother, Ron, worked as a head engineer for Ziax-Av Engineering. As mathematicians, the pair had keen interest in probably games, including roulette, craps, and poker.</p>
<p>They eventually reached out to the Shaked brothers and shared their plans about a way to bring these games online, an idea that stuck with everyone. Shay was tasked with developing a unique software platform that would allow the casino to go live.</p>
<p>He was, in a sense, what Steve Jobs was to Apple. A pioneer who understood not only the technical side, but also wanted to create a user-friendly product that would give the platform the best chances of striking home with players.</p>
<p>The company suffered a big dip in operating profits after the United States passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), making it illegal for 888 Holdings to operate in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Most founders decided to move on, but Shay stuck with the company as its chief technology officer. He stepped down in 2006 and remained with 888 in a non-executive role which he then relinquished back in 2010 to spend more time with his family.</p>
