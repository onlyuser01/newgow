    <h1>Rising Star Casino Rising Sun Indiana Planet7 Casino Casino Canada Parx Casino Shippensburg Pa How M</h1>

<p>I have been playing casinoly games for a while now. I liked the weekly challenges, that is, when you play certain games with a certain bet a certain amount, you get points that can be used for bonuses, etc.</p>
<p>About a couple of weeks ago, I was still playing a challenge game when in the middle of the game the game froze and I couldn't play it at all. I thought it was some temporary problem. However, this particular game has not been able to be launched at all since that situation.</p>
<p>Could this be a coincidence, or can the casino deliberately prevent the playing of a game so that points cannot be accumulated? There is no mention in the site's terms of use that the game in question (wolf saga) cannot be played in Finland.</p>
<p>I have asked about this customer service several times, they have always answered that it is an update, because of which the game cannot be played. and switching to other games is recommended.</p>
<p>In general, I ask, how honest are the casinos in their own campaigns? In my opinion, Casinoly has a very good bonus system, but if games are blocked from it in this way, it seems that the games will remain on that site.</p>
