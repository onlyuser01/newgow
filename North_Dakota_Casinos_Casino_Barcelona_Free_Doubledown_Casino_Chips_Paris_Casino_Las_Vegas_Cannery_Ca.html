<p>Leading in-depth sports betting analytics products provider, Inside Edge, has entered into a partnership with real-time scores, stats and odds provider Sports Alerts and the self-proclaimed king of online sportsbooks, BetMGM. The new deals will see Inside Edge expand its offerings into the broad and exciting world of sports betting. Furthermore, the company is introducing a new product by the name My Inside Edge.</p>
<p>Inside Edge Enters the Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>Through the crucial deal with Sports Alerts, Inside Edge will provide the latter’s customers with its acclaimed products, focused on the National Football League and the Major League Baseball. This will include 5-Star Picks, Inside Edge’s pick to win against the spread and Reasons, a product that estimates which team in a professional sports game has the advantage.</p>
<p>The BetMGM partnership, on the other hand, is a two-year agreement that was signed in September, earlier this year. According to that deal, Inside Edge will be responsible for using its Remarkable insights product to benefit BetMGM. Remarkable insights is Inside Edge’s artificial intelligence-based technology that analyzes sports data and compiles performance insights that are automatically produced, displayed and updated during sports events. Through this, IE will make sure that BetMGM’s game notes for the NFL, MLB and NCAAF are on point and usher in more traffic, increasing the operator’s revenues as an extension.</p>
<p>Inside Edge Launches My Inside Edge</p>
<p>Capitalizing on its steady growth, Inside Edge has announced the launch of its brand new fan-oriented product called My Inside Edge. The newly-released product is a site that provides free matchup insights, as well as projections. This would help sports bettors and daily fantasy players alike, as both will be aided in making smart and informed decisions when placing a wager or making fantasy picks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the insights include IE’s Reasons solution, as well as the company’s pick to win against the spread product called Daily Fantasy Player Cards.</p>
<p>Randy Istre, the chief executive officer of Inside Edge, has spoken about the partnerships and the newly-launched product. Istre said that Inside Edge will continue seeking to innovate and expand its offerings, which is why the whole team is excited by its debut in the sports betting world. Istre said that Inside Edge is glad to have its foray into sports betting supported by notable brands, such as BetMGM and Sports Alerts.</p>
<p>“The power of our Remarkable insights engine in combination with their engaged users creates an elevated experience for fans and sports bettors,” Istre noted.</p>
