<p>Jack Hermansson vs. Joe Pyfer will serve as the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 94, which will take place at UFC Apex in Vegas on Saturday, February 10, 2024</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why Dana White and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) decided to book the Jack Hermansson vs. Joe Pyfer middleweight fight as the main event of UFC on ESPN+ 94, it’s because this is going to be a real banger.</p>
<p>Both fighters are famously good when it comes to striking, with Hermansson landing more than 5 significant strikes a minute. Pyfer meanwhile, is more about power than volume, the evidence being that he’s the one to break Francis Ngannou’s record for the hardest punch in the world.</p>

<p>Jack Hermansson Knows How to Fight Fights Like These</p>
<p>Jack Hermansson is a 35-year-old Scandinavian who’s been in the fighting business since 2010. His overall record is 23-8, with practically all of his losses happening to real elite middleweights. Among the fighters who have defeated “The Joker” are the following:</p>
<p>Sean Strickland (former UFC Middleweight champion)</p>
<p>Marvin Vettori (former UFC Middleweight title challenger)</p>
<p>Jared Cannonier (former UFC Middleweight title challenger)</p>
<p>Thiago Santos (former UFC Light Heavyweight title challenger)</p>
<p>When it comes to his wins, one of his best performances was in the fight with Chris Curtis, which he won by unanimous decision. He landed 100 significant strikes in that fight while getting hit only 43 times.</p>
<p>The reason why this fight is important is that Curtis isn’t too dissimilar to Hermansson’s next opponent, Joe Pyfer. Same as Pyfer, he too is a powerful striker with more than half of his wins happening by KO/TKO.</p>
<p>Joe Pyfer Plotting Another Win by a Finish</p>
<p>Joe Pyfer is 12-2 overall with eight of his wins happening by KO/TKO and three by submission. He’s undefeated in his last five UFC fights, winning four of those by KO/TKO and one by submission. His last loss happened in Dana White’s Contender Serious. The referee ruled it a technical knockout after Pyfer suffered an elbow injury.</p>
<p>This guy has amazing wrestling skills as evident from the fact that he lands almost three takedowns per 15 minutes on average.</p>

<p>Still, his strongest weapon is boxing. He’s quick and great at dodging punches, the evidence being that he gets hit only 2.34 times per minute. In comparison, Hermansson absorbs 3.69 significant strikes a minute.</p>
<p>Pyfer doesn’t land too many strikes (3.64), but his strikes are incredibly devastating to the opponent. This guy might have the most powerful striking ability in the UFC Middleweight Division. After all, there’s a video of him breaking Francis Ngannou’s record for the hardest punch.</p>
<p>Jack Hermansson vs. Joe Pyfer Prediction</p>
<p>Jack Hermansson looks exactly like the fighter who can derail the Joe Pyfer hype train. This guy is tough enough to avoid getting finished by Pyer, while his high striking volume could lead him to win over the judges.</p>
<p>Pick: Jack Hermansson</p>
