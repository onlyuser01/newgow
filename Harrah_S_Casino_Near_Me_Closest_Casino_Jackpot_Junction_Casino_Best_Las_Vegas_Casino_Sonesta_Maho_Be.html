    <h1>Harrah S Casino Near Me Closest Casino Jackpot Junction Casino Best Las Vegas Casino Sonesta Maho Be</h1>

<p>GOOD NIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE A COMPLAINT HERE AT CASINO GURU BECAUSE ALL CASINO SITES THAT I PLAY I ALWAYS LOOK FOR HERE, AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME SITES ALWAYS DO THE SAME, I WILL EXPLAIN I HAVE OR HAD ACTUALLY A BODOG CASINO ACCOUNT WITH MORE THAN 3 YEARS WHEN I SITE STILL HAD POKER GAMES. MY FIRST PROBLEM ON THE SITE WAS THAT I COULDN'T BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE OLD EMAIL IN THIS CASE THEY RESOLVED IT QUICKLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MONEY INVOLVED OR A WITHDRAWAL REQUEST, THEN ALL THAT TIME HAPPENED ANOTHER PROBLEM I WANTED TO MAKE A DEPOSIT ON THE SITE BUT THERE WAS NO METHOD IN MY ACCOUNT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT, I MUST HAVE TALKED AT LEAST 50 TIMES WITH THE SITE ATTENDANTS AND I ALWAYS GOT THE SAME ANSWER THAT MY ACCOUNT WAS OK, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM AND THEY ALWAYS PASSED TO CLEAN THE PC WHICH I ALWAYS DID AND WAS NEVER SOLVED, SO BODOG INAUGHT A NEW AWARD-WINNING LIVE PROMOTION IN WHICH THEY ALWAYS PASS A CODE TO GET THE RIGHT TO PLAY IN THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF 15 REAIS. I PLAYED ON THE SITE THROUGH THIS AWARD LIVE BECAUSE I COULDN'T MAKE A DEPOSIT, I MUST HAVE PLAYED ON THE SITE THROUGH THE AWARD LIVE BONUS ABOUT 30 TIMES AND I NEVER WON ANYTHING, SO TWO MONTHS AGO I PLAYED AGAIN WITH THE AWARD LIVE CODE I WON 300 REAIS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE BONUS SCORE I WENT TO TRY TO WITHDRAW, IN MY WITHDRAWAL AREA I ONLY DID THE WITHDRAWAL BY BITCOIN, THEN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THEM FIRST THAT I WAS INQUIRING THE WITHDRAWAL AND THEN I RECEIVED ANOTHER EMAIL CANCELING THE WITHDRAWAL AND BY INCREDIBLE AND illogical I RECEIVED ANOTHER EMAIL INFORMING THAT MY ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED, I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE PROBLEM THEY PASSED THAT I HAD SHARE MY DATA I GOT CRAZY WHO WILL SHARE YOUR DATA WITHOUT NOCTION. THEN I RECEIVED ANOTHER EMAIL INFORMING THAT THE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DISABLED DUE TO HAVING SEVERAL ACCOUNTS PLAYING IN THE SAME PLACE AND THERE IS, MY MOTHER, BROTHER, FATHER AND A FRIEND WE ALWAYS PLAYED MONDAY HERE AT HOME ON THE DAY OF THE AWARD LIVE. EVERYONE HAS DOCUMENTS VERIFIED ACCOUNTS AND WE PLAYED ABOUT 20 LIVES TOGETHER, JUST THE DAY I WON AS ALWAYS WITHOUT SCRUPULS SITES DEACTIVATED MY ACCOUNT AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY CANCELED BECAUSE I WON AND REQUESTED A WITHDRAWAL. I TRIED IN EVERY WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME. SO I'M TRYING THE LAST CARD HERE BECAUSE IT'S VERY UNFAIR WHAT THEY DO TO BRAZILIAN PLAYERS WE ALL KNOW WHY. SO I ASK YOU TO HELP ME IN THE CASE IF THEY INFORM THAT THE PROBLEM WAS SEVERAL ACCOUNTS PLAYING IN THE SAME LOCATION I CAN SEND ALL DOCUMENTS AGAIN WHICH ACCOUNTS ARE THESE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT, BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS MY FAMILY I CAN SEND SELFIE AND ETC. AND THE NECESSARY THE ONLY ACCOUNT DISABLED WAS MY BROTHER STILL HAS HIS ACCOUNT MY MOTHER ALSO JUST MY WIFE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE BECAUSE HE ASKED TO CANCEL IT. SORRY FOR THE LONG COMPLAINT AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO PROVIDE ALL THE FACTS. SO I'M WAITING FOR SOME HELP FROM YOU BECAUSE THE BODOG SITE IS STILL HERE AT GURU. IF YOU NEED ANY DOCUMENT I'M AVAILABLE. THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.</p>
