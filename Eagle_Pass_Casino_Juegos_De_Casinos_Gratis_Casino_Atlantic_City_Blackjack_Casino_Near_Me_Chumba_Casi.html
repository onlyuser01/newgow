<p>The provider of software and content for the iGaming industry, Swintt, announced the release of its latest Premium game called Cleopatras Pearls. The new high volatility game features the evergreen Egyptian theme and delivers engaging features and four different jackpot levels. The iGaming developer’s latest title brings quality graphics and the player-favorite Pearl feature, along with other functions that grant a chance for significant payouts.</p>
<p>The release of Cleopatras Pearls follows the launch of Duolito Iceman from early last month. At the time, Swintt unveiled details regarding the thrilling gelateria-themed slot that delivers sticky wilds and free spins with a max win of up to 1,200x. Before that, earlier this summer, Swintt released Treasures of Rome, another Premium slot title with 20 paylines, low volatility and a max win of 450x.</p>

<p>A New Egyptian-Themed Slot with Engaging Features</p>
<p>Players that tap into Cleopatras Pearls can expect to see standard card symbols between 10 and Ace as the low-paying symbols. However, the game comes packed with high-paying symbols as well that include sarcophagi, statues of Horus, shields and even Cleopatra herself. As one of Swintt’s Premium titles, the new game brings familiar sounds as well as gameplay mechanics from classic slot machines. Despite the classic feel, the game stands out with quality animations and sound effects.</p>
<p>“This is certainly the case in our exciting new Egyptian-themed release, Cleopatras Pearls, where players will now have access to boosters, multipliers and summarizers which can all increase their standard payouts, as well as four special jackpot prizes to boost winnings to a maximum of 3,000 x the bet!“ David Mann, CEO at Swintt</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt’s CEO, spoke about the thrilling Pearl feature that has become a part of the company’s range of Premium slot games. He outlined that the company worked to improve the bonus with each newly released game that includes the feature. Mann added that Cleopatras Pearls delivers a thrilling gameplay with modifiers, boosters as well and four-tier jackpots.</p>
<p>The Slot Brings Golden Pearls, Free Spins</p>
<p>Players of Swintt’s newest game that land enough golden pearls can benefit from an engaging bonus round. Landing six or more such symbols during a single spin anywhere on the reel takes the players to a new 5×3 reel that features triggering pearls. “Initially, each of these symbols will spin to reveal a cash prize and players will receive a starting set of three free spins,” explains Swintt.</p>
<p>During this bonus round, a free spins counter indicates how many are remaining. If players land a new pearl symbol, they reset the counter. The special bonus round can continue until the counter reaches zero or there are no free spaces available on the reels. Elevating the excitement further, some pearls can offer a bonus modifier, granting a potential for mouth-watering prizes.</p>
<p>Lucky players can land special chest icons. Once this happens, “a countdown of ten will be displayed to indicate the number of spins needed before the chest will open,” reveals Swintt, explaining that once this number hits zero, players will be awarded randomly a Minor, Major, Maxi or Mega Pot.</p>
