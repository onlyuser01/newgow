<p>Tennis Data Innovations (TDI), unveiled a new partnership with the leading global sports technology company, Sportradar.</p>
<p>Sportradar and Tennis Data Innovations to Boost Integrity</p>
<p>The new collaboration was announced Tuesday and will see the duo join forces to expand the distribution of official ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour tennis data, elevating the experience for fans of the sport around the globe. The companies explained that the new collaboration will introduce “a new secondary feed, which enables the provision of betting-related services based on official ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour scores to a suite of global bookmakers.”</p>
<p>Before this collaboration, bookmakers collected data such as scores from the umpire’s chair. Now, thanks to the new partnerships, bookmakers will benefit from a new data feed that will offer ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour details throughout the season, as well as during doubles and qualifying matches. Bookmakers can leverage this uninterrupted data and boost the betting experiences for their users.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new deal with TDI, Sportradar joins its growing list of partners some of which offer odds, as well as trading services. However, the new collaboration will not only seek to introduce a second data feed but also enhance the integrity of the sport by developing transparent business partnerships with more operators.</p>
<p>Data Feed Expected to Bring Benefits for Bookmakers</p>
<p>Sportradar’s MD partner and content management, Moritz Gloeckler, revealed that by joining forces with TDI, the company uncovered a new way to provide official tennis data for the growing betting industry. The company explained that the delivery of the data feed was facilitated via a sub-licensing agreement inked between IMG Arena, Sportradar and TDI.</p>
<p>“By taking a constructive and innovative commercial approach, TDI has found a way to serve another part of the market with official data.“ Moritz Gloeckler, MD partner and content management at Sportradar</p>
<p>According to Gloeckler, thanks to the aforementioned sub-licensing agreement, Sportradar expands the reach of its data to more sportsbooks that previously didn’t have access to official data and at the same time enhances the appeal of sports fans and bettors to the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour events.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to welcome Sportradar, a leader and innovator in the sports data industry, as a supply partner to TDI.“ David Lampitt, CEO at TDI</p>
<p>TDI’s CEO, David Lampitt, added that the company is excited to join forces with a leading sports data innovator such as Sportradar. He added that Sportradar joins a growing list of leading industry partners that help TDI expand the distribution of tennis data to companies in different jurisdictions around the world. In conclusion, Lampitt predicted that the collaboration will help operators by generating “new revenue streams to invest back into the sport.”</p>
