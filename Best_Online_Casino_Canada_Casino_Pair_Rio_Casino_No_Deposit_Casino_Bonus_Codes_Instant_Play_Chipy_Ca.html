    <h1>Best Online Casino Canada Casino Pair Rio Casino No Deposit Casino Bonus Codes Instant Play Chipy Ca</h1>

<p>Hello dear Yulia!</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. The fact is that, as the representative of this forum has already written, playing in a casino has no guarantees of winning - it all depends only on your luck. It happens that the winnings do not fall at all for weeks, or even months, and, unfortunately, this is normal for a casino. RTP in slots is configured by the provider and how the return will work depends only on the provider. I understand that it is unpleasant to lose without any winnings, but if you see that you are unlucky today, then you should not continue the game now - it is better to postpone it until tomorrow. I usually play in a casino only for the amount that I am ready to say goodbye to - this is a guarantee of peace of mind for me. In this case, I will not be sorry to lose this money, but it will be nice if I can win something from it. Excitement here can play a fatal role and RTP, as everyone knows, gives in the long run, according to statistics, less than you originally contributed, be it 95% or 97% - this is always less than 100%. And this means only one thing, that if you spin the slot to the end, hoping to win more than you have, or, as they say, "recapture your own" - you will be left, judging by the statistics, with nothing. Therefore, the amount that you allocate for the game is very important to properly control so as not to fall into tilt and blame the casino without reason. I wish you great success in this difficult endeavor and hope for mutual understanding. Remember that the game should always be approached responsibly, and the casino should be judged not by the payoff in slots developed by the same providers, but by the internal content of the site. I hope that you will be lucky with us in the near future so that you will forget about all the failures and you will have only good impressions!</p>
<p>Best wishes, Pin-Up Casino!</p>
