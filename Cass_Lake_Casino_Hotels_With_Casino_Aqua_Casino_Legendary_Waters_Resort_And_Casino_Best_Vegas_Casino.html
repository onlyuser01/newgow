    <h1>Cass Lake Casino Hotels With Casino Aqua Casino Legendary Waters Resort And Casino Best Vegas Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Brushmanx,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>„General terms</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, the maximum withdrawal limit on free spins is: EUR 50 / USD 50 / CAD 75 / NZD 75 / PLN 200 / NOK 500 / ZAR 900 / JPY 6,500 / HUF 17,500, not counting the deposit amount. Remaining balance will be written-off in favour of the Casino. In order to withdraw your winnings obtained from a no deposit bonus, which is given upon registration, it is necessary to make at least one valid deposit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum you will ever be able to withdraw from play with funds associated with a no deposit bonus is EUR 50 / USD 50 / CAD 75 / NZD 75 / PLN 200 / NOK 500 / ZAR 900 / JPY 6,500 / HUF 17,50."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do I understand correctly that your winnings have been accumulated solely from Free Spins?</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play, especially when it comes to No Deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that I have overlooked, but I’m afraid I will be forced to reject your complaint as unjustified. I wish I could be of more help.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply and understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
