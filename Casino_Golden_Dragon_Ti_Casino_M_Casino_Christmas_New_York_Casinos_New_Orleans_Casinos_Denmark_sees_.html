<p>The Danish gambling self-exclusion program, referred to as ROFUS, hasreached a new milestone. The program remains one of the most efficient tools in providing sustained support to players who are looking to limit their harmful gambling practices.</p>
<p>The program was set up in 2012 and it has been hailed as one of the most successful solutions to help regulate gambling behavior, Spillemyndigheden, the Danish gambling regulator confirmed in a recent press release. According to the regulator, 40,000 people from the country have excluded themselves as of February, 2023, demonstrating the effectiveness of ROFUS and the important role it plays in helping consumers in Denmark regulate their gambling.</p>
<p>There are several reasons attributable to the success of the self-exclusion program, the regulator argues. Anders Dorph, director of Spillemyndigheden, outlined that the self-exclusion program enjoyed a high level of awareness among the Danish population, which made it readily available and a sought-out solution overall. Of course, this was not done without the concentrated efforts of the regulator as well.</p>
<p>"Among other things, we have launched two large campaigns on TV and social media, which were very successful. Our most recent figures from 2021 show that 45 percent of all Danes know of ROFUS," Dorph said, explaining some of the efforts that have gone down in making sure the program is known to people who may be interested.</p>
<p>He stressed how important it was for the regulator to help Danes know that they can always turn to self-exclusion options and never worry about letting their gambling get out of control. In the 11 years the program has been active, the regulator has noticed that 66% of all registered people with ROFUS have decided to go with the permanent exclusion option offered by ROFUS.</p>
<p>"It is essential to ensure a safe gambling market that those who need to self-exclude from gambling for a short while or a long-term period can do it easily and effectively," Dorph explained. Dorph is confident that ROFUS can be deemed a success, not just by the sheer number of people who have self-excluded, but also because the regulator believes that once excluded, consumers do make the necessary steps towards recovery.</p>
<p>A separate service run by the regulator, StopSpillet, is a helpline where anyone can call and seek help to rein in their gambling habits. The line also works with family and friends who have been impacted by the gambling habits of someone they love. ROFUS has also seen 76% of all people registering for self-exclusion being male with the program going strong in 2023.</p>
