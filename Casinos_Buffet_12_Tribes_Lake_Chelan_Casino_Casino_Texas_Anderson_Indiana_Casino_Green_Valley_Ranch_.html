<p>Enjoying an outstanding grand final between Team Secret and OG, Omega League Season 1 finished peaking at over 400,000 concurrent live viewers.</p>
<p>Omega League Season 1 Garners Record-Breaking Viewership</p>
<p>With The International postponed and several Dota Pro Circuit events cancelled, WePlay! Esports and Epic Esports have proved that they can pull off fantastic feats even in the absence of competitive Dota 2.</p>
<p>In fact, Epic Sports and WePlay! have made competitive Dota 2 happen and that is the best thing about the latest Omega League which reached over 400,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>This is the second-highest non-Dota Pro Circuit event on record that managed to collect a record-breaking number of viewers, Esports Charts reported. The viewership climbed up for the final showdown between Team Secret and OG with Secret clinching a seventh contested victory.</p>
<p>WePlay! has repeatedly hosted events and tournaments that excel in production quality and set the standards high for other tournament hosts.</p>
<p>Omega League Confirmed for Second Season</p>
<p>Thanks to Epic Esports, the organizations have been able to gather some of the most promising teams, and a second season has already been confirmed for October, filling up some of the vacuum that DPC events have left.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Omega League is officially the second-most watched non-DPC event, as mentioned. The only event to have gathered bigger online viewership was the ESL One Los Angeles 2020, which attracted over 500,000 viewers.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Leipzig Major, the last official Dota Pro Circuit event in this competitive season attracted some 457,236 viewers. Meanwhile, the MDL Chengdu Major had some 353,798 people watching.</p>
<p>Congratulations to @teamsecret, the winners of the first season of Omega League!</p>
<p>We'd like to thank all of the teams that took part in this event.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone involved in making it happenz</p>
<p>Omega League will return for the 2nd Season later this year. #OmegaDota â€” Omega Dota 2 League (@OmegaDotaLeague) September 6, 2020</p>
<p>In the meantime, Omega League showed that Team Secret have returned to their former glory. Contested by Team Nigma and OG, Secret managed to win 17 out of the 19 games it played, giving it the highest win rate with 89.47%.</p>
<p>The team to come second was Nigma, the former Team Liquid roster, which won 59.09%. Besides, Omega League also highlighted another interesting statistic, and specifically that the meta in 7.27 is quite diverse.</p>
<p>Some 105 different heroes were picked across 154 different games, highlighting a sort of open-mindedness among players as to what heroes can be played successfully.</p>
