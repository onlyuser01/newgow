<p>Play’n GO has announced the release of the Dutch Flip blockbuster to the Dutch market following its successful release in the Netherlands in 2022</p>
<p>The Swedish-based business-to-business online provider of slots responsible for some of the most iconic titles in the industry including the Book of Dead series and Reactoonz, Play’n GO, has announced the release of its Dutch Flip slot to the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Harnessing the Momentum</p>
<p>Originally, Play’n GO released the blockbuster game in the Netherlands a year ago as a monthly single-operator exclusive.</p>
<p>The slot, which will be accessible to all licensed operators in the Dutch market starting November 24, packs a series of interesting features related to important Dutch symbols and landmarks that players are expected to associate with Holland.</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s head of regional sales for Western and Central Europe, Giovanni Ferraro, explained the importance of the Dutch market for the company while expressing their excitement about their ability to design and release “a game that resonates so strongly with players in that market.”</p>
<p>Further commenting on the news, the head of regional sales explained Dutch Flip incorporates all the necessary qualities to turn into a “Play’n GO classic”.</p>
<p>Ferraro also expressed confidence that players located in the Netherlands will appreciate engaging in a game that has been designed to showcase the “essence of Dutch culture.”</p>
<p>Play’n GO, “Committed to Success in the Netherlands”</p>
<p>The game, which introduces players to clogs, gouda, bicycles, windmills, and other cultural delights, is expected to assist Play’n GO with its plans to succeed in the Netherlands in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>The 5×3 slot was first released at the start of April, 2022. Players can choose between one and 20 active paylines and place from $0,01 to $100 per spin.</p>
<p>The medium-volatile game shows great winning of up to 10,000x the stake. Free Spins and near-win Respins are also available, adding more thrill to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Once the first and the second reels display an identical stack of symbols without generating a win, the reel in the middle will respins, giving players another chance to hit a win.</p>
<p>Players who land wild symbols on the first two reels can also enjoy a respin. To engage the Free Spins feature, players must land three golden scatters on any random reel.</p>
<p>While the round is engaged, the reels are flipped, with the last reel taking the place of the first reel and vice versa. Players can also retrigger the Free Spins once a minimum of three at scatter symbols land, for up to 90 Free Spins in total.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Play’n GO announced setting a new record with around 250 million rounds played on a single day, on November 1.</p>
<p>A month before, the company inked an agreement deal with BeyondPlay.</p>
