<p>The final match of Round 19 of the Italian Serie A is arguably the most interesting one. The reigning champions AC Milan are traveling to the capital on Tuesday to take on Lazio</p>
<p>Lazio vs AC Milan might not be the biggest rivalry in Italian soccer, but it’s certainly up there. And this time, it’s going to be even more exciting than usual! Why? Because both teams are flying very high in the Serie A standings, each with even higher ambitions for the remainder of the season.</p>

<p>Lazio are (Almost) Always Great on Their Turf</p>
<p>At Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Lazio are 5-2-2 in the 2022-23 Serie A season. This makes them the fifth-best home side in the competition. They were great on home turf before the World Cup, and we expect them to do even better in the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>So far in 2023, they’ve played only one home game, but failed to win. The game in question is the one against Empoli, which ended in a 2-2 draw. Their second home match in the Serie A this year is on the program on Tuesday when they welcome AC Milan.</p>
<p>With the help of their fans, they look like a team that could give AC Milan a run for their money. History, however, teaches us otherwise. Even though they’re usually great in Rome, Lazio haven’t done much in home games against AC Milan in the last couple of years. In fact, the hosts won only three of the last 10 Lazio vs AC Milan games that took place at Olimpico.</p>
<p>AC Milan Can’t Afford to Lose Any More Points</p>
<p>Ahead of Round 19, AC Milan are trailing by 9 points behind table-leaders Napoli. Sure, there’s plenty of time left for the reigning champs to bridge the gap, but the trouble is that the Sky Blues from Naples are in top form. An even worse problem is that Rossoneri are not.</p>
<p>AC Milan have already played five games in 2023, but they managed to win only one of those. The good news for them is that the win in question happened in Serie A, which is their top priority. Their most recent game, however, was the Italian Super Cup, in which they got hammered by their intercity rivals, Inter Milan. The final score was 3-0 for Nerazzurri.</p>
<p>More bad news for AC Milan is that they got a number of players struggling with fitness. The good news – if you can call it that – is that Lazio too will miss a couple of key men, most notably, their goalscoring maestro, Ciro Immobile.</p>
<p>Lazio vs AC Milan Prediction</p>
<p>If you compare the players of these two teams, you’ll see that there’s not much difference between Lazio and Napoli in terms of quality. Still, we do believe that those playing for AC Milan are slightly better than Lazio’s players.</p>
<p>This, however, doesn’t mean they’re so superior that they can win in Rome. We doubt that can happen, but we also doubt Lazio can win. Instead, the draw seems like the most probable outcome.</p>
<p>Picks: Lazio and AC Milan to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
