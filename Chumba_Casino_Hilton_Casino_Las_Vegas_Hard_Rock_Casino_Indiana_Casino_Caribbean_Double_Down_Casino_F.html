<p>The soccer club will promote the betting brand across its home stadium</p>
<p>Blackburn Rovers FC, a British professional soccer team, has announced a major gambling sponsorship agreement with Spreadex, a UK-based sports betting company. Under the agreement, Spreadex has been named as the club’s official UK betting partner.</p>
<p>The deal, signed ahead of the 2023-24 season, will see the gambling company support the club. In return, the soccer team will promote the operator’s brand throughout the season.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Spreadex’s logo will feature in the Jack Walker Stand and digital advertising across Ewood Park, the Rovers’ home stadium.</p>
<p>Spreadex is an award-winning British betting company founded in 1999. Over the years, the operator has cemented itself as one of the leading players in the United Kingdom’s sports betting and trading sector.</p>
<p>The deal with the Rovers highlights the company’s commitment to supporting the sports sector. Spreadex is also interested in the emerging esports sector as attested by its recent esports deals with SIS.</p>
<p>The Two Parties Are Happy about the Deal</p>
<p>The Blackburn Rovers’ chief executive officer, Steve Waggott, welcomed Spreadex as the club’s official UK betting partner for the 2023-24 season, expressing his excitement about the deal. He praised the company for its history of strong performance and said that his team hopes to develop this relationship.</p>
<p>Award-winning, Spreadex will join a range of other new partners for the forthcoming season and we are looking forward to working with their team to further develop and strengthen our partnership over the coming months. Steve Waggott, CEO, Blackburn Rovers</p>
<p>Andy MacKenzie, Spreadex’s head of marketing, also commented on the new partnership agreement. He said that his team is “really pleased” to join an ambitious soccer club, steeped in tradition.</p>
<p>MacKenzie noted that Spreadex is looking forward to supporting the Rovers’ journey. He teased that the operator has already planned a number of fan-oriented activations.</p>
<p>We’re delighted to be part of Rovers’ journey moving forwards and are already planning a series of competitions and content to keep Rovers fans engaged via our social channels, plus looking at ways to help support local club community initiatives. Andy MacKenzie, head of marketing, Spreadex</p>
<p>MacKenzie admitted that Spreadex’s team already sports a number of Rovers enthusiasts, which is why the company is so excited about the next soccer season.</p>
<p>The agreement between the two parties comes amid intense critiques of sponsorship deals between sports clubs and sports betting operators and betting ads.</p>
