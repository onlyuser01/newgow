    <h1>Casino Royale Daniel Craig Taj Mahal Casino Casino In India Casinos In Davenport Iowa Casino Murder</h1>

<p>SimWin Sports, a virtual sports metaverse that fuels 24/7 fantasy sports and sports betting, has reinforced its team with the addition of Jamie Shea as a non-executive director (NED). Shea has years of experience in the sports betting sector and will be a valuable addition to SimWin’s team.</p>
<p>SimWin Named Shea a NED</p>
<p>Shea has worked in the sports betting industry for almost three decades and is well-familiar with the industry. She has worked for some of the biggest companies in the sector, including industry leaders such as Hard Rock, Caesars Entertainment Carnival, IGT and DraftKings. In her latest position, Shea worked as the vice president of national VIP marketing at DraftKings.</p>
<p>As a NED at SimWin, Shea will be responsible to oversee the company’s overall business across all verticals. She will have the opportunity to reunite with Tom Goedde, a former colleague of hers who used to work as the chief marketing officer of DraftKings.</p>
<p>SimWin Sports prides itself on combining real-money gambling and fantasy sports with web3 video game tech to deliver unforgettable experiences to fans of professional sports. To ensure the best quality of products for its customers, the company prizes talent before anything else and fields a team comprised of seasoned professionals.</p>
<p>Ortiz Welcomed Shea on Board</p>
<p>David Ortiz, SimWin Sports’ founder and chief executive, lauded Shea as a “real-money All-Star” as he welcomed her to the company. He praised her exceptional work with Strive Gaming, DraftKings and other big gaming companies and said that she will be a huge addition to SimWin’s team.</p>
<p>Ortiz added that Shea will be of great help during the football season, as she will be integral to adding betting and fantasy elements to SimWin’s game.</p>
<p>We know we’re in her more-than-capable hands, and her knowledge will be crucial as we aim to deliver sports fans the first 24/7/365 virtual sports league. David Ortiz, CEO, SimWin Sports</p>
<p>Shea also spoke about her new position. She said that joining the company’s distinguished team was a “no-brainer.” She said that the experiences SimWin delivers are nothing sort of exceptional and said that she believes the company will become a trendsetter.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm that David, Tom, and the entire team have shown about the product only further confirms that SimWin will put forth a user experience unlike any other. I can’t wait to share my knowledge to further develop the product and deliver a superior player experience. Jamie Shea, NED, SimWin Sports</p>
<p>SimWin is bullish on becoming a force to be reckoned with. The company’s goal is to deliver more than 5,000 games a year to fans of professional sports.</p>
