    <h1>Miami Online Casino Buckys Casino Hollywood Casino Pa West Palm Beach Casino Houston Casino Betmaste</h1>

<p>Hello, unfortunately I came to this forum very late.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I registered and made a deposit of 135 usd in betmaster, they gave me a 100% welcome bonus, after a week of placing bets and completing the requirements and placing bets for a couple of days plus my account balance It was about 130 usd, I made a withdrawal request and after 1 day a message appeared that said "your withdrawal request has failed", I contacted support and told them the problem, they told me that it must be a technical problem and that I request it again, I request the withdrawal again and this time I don't get a response, the next day I contact support again and they tell me that it must be a technical problem but that it was the weekend and the technicians "no they work weekends</p>
<p>I waited until Monday and I got the email "your withdrawal request has failed" I contact support again and they tell me that "they will consult my case with the specialists" after several hours I get an email telling me that I must verify my account on the platform, at that very moment I verify my account as requested and request a withdrawal again, the next day I receive an email telling me that I must verify my account "in another way" and for that They ask me:</p>
<p>1 photo of my document on both sides.</p>
<p>2 screenshots of my wallet and the transaction.</p>
<p>3 selfie with the chat in the background (something quite strange)</p>
<p>Despite it seeming strange to me, I send everything they ask me for, a couple of days later they tell me to also send them a selfie with the deposit transaction in the background (despite it seeming strange to me) I send the selfie at that moment They tell me that the verification "takes up to 5 days", a whole week passes and no one sends me any news and I contact support and they tell me that they will "consult my case with the specialists" several hours later they tell me that the last selfie did not It was clear and the numbers were not visible (which was a lie because I carefully checked that the data is visible) and I send another selfie with a different background color so that there is no doubt.</p>
<p>After another day I contact support again and ask for the status of my account and they tell me that the verification "takes up to 5 days" and that I must be patient and wait.</p>
<p>My question is, what happens if after those 5 days (which are a week, because they DON'T WORK WEEKENDS) they tell me that they need another photo?</p>
<p>If you need another photo or document and I send it, will I have to wait another week?</p>
<p>I find Betmaster's way of acting quite abusive and I think they are simply looking for an excuse to delay withdrawals longer because, who needs 5 days to verify a photo? What is the use of having a verification process on the page if it is useless because then they ask you to complete another verification process? Why do they ask you for selfies as strange as with the cell phone in your hand?</p>
<p>I also want to clarify that my withdrawal was only 130 usd and I deposited 135 usd, that my bets were not high, all of them were around 20 - 30 usd at most and most were about baseball and some other on a winning team in soccer at most a few $10 per bet.</p>
<p>I don't want to imagine what would have happened if I had done better and my balance had increased more, surely they would even ask me for blood tests.</p>
