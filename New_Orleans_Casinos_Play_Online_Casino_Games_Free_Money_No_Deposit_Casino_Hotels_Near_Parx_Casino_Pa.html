    <h1>New Orleans Casinos Play Online Casino Games Free Money No Deposit Casino Hotels Near Parx Casino Pa</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play, an esteemed supplier of live casino and slot games, has signed a new content extension with Rank Group and will power the brand’s digital operations with its Live Casino portfolio. This way the two parties are further strengthening their mutual alliance and will seek to expand and shore up their offers.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Pragmatic Play will be able to introduce its Live Casino games with Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo, which are leading brands in the United Kingdom and, on the other, Rank Group will continue to add titles by some of the best suppliers, demonstrating a strong commitment to game diversity and bringing players top-of-the-range titles.</p>
<p>The two are moving forward with this tie-up after the companies worked together on the Slot offerings that Pragmatic Play launched with Rank as part of an earlier arrangement.</p>
<p>Naturally, the new opportunity was welcomed from both camps, with Rank Group Head of Gaming Cyrus Moreno excited to see more of Pragmatic’s brilliant games made available across the group’s operations. Moreno added:</p>
<p>"The Live Casino offerings are sure to also be high performers with multiple acclaimed titles in the portfolio. We’re excited to further bolster our partnership with Pragmatic Play and can’t wait to see what the future holds."</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Chief Operating Officer at Pragmatic Play, was similarly pleased to build upon the existing slot relationship and progress towards a more comprehensive offer. "We are excited to keep being part of Rank’s success," Cornides noted.</p>
<p>Among the games that Rank Group players can enjoy moving forward are such fantastic options such as Vegas Ball Bonanza, Boom City, and Sweet Bonanza CandyLand. Pragmatic Play has expended significant effort to ensure that its portfolio of titles continue to grow across a number of verticals.</p>
<p>The company is present in Live Casino, Bingo, and Slots, and it has no intention of relenting just yet, with close to ten new titles every month. Pragmatic Play has also been busy building its footprint well beyond the United Kingdom, as the company expanded on its partnership with Napoleon in Belgium, and added Live Casino products to the already existing slot alliance.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pragmatic Play introduced its games with Casino Magic Online in Argentina, and even hosted a dedicated 1xBet Live Casino game show to further shift towards customization and tailored experiences that focus on individual brands and their unique IP.</p>
