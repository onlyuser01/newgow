    <h1>Poseidon Casino Vegas Carnival Casino Offers 2023 Casino Signup Bonus Salt Lake City Casino White Cl</h1>

<ol>
<li>On January 21, 2022. my winning bet was declared a loser. I sent an email to support@efbet.com / [Ticket # 2022012054014438] /,</li>
</ol>
<p>but so far there has been no assistance in reviewing the pledge and reimbursing my profit on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>I have the chronology of the bet in question, which clearly shows that the bet is winning and the profit is BGN 666.</p>
<ol>
<li>Yesterday / January 24, 2022 / I became a victim of total ridicule and hoax by your on-duty employee "Contacts" named Svetlin.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the situation: On January 24, 2022. I received a bonus offer for BGN 2,935. I deposited the amount of BGN 2,935 and received the bonus on the balance. I bet the bonus 4-5 times and registered turnovers for over BGN 13,600,</p>
<p>with which I fully met the requirements before withdrawal.</p>
<p>My balance was BGN 8,215 and I ordered `four withdrawals for BGN 4,215 with Ticket number # 2022012454028425; Ticket # 2022012454028434; Ticket # 2022012454028443; Ticket # 2022012454028452.</p>
<p>The duty officer Svetlin canceled my draws with the explanation that I had played unfairly and had guaranteed myself a profit from Roulette, which is absurd and untenable.</p>
<p>How is it possible for me to influence Roulette and the game provider?</p>
<p>This brought me absolute stress and a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Svetlin also said that I have to roll the bonus twice again until he decides when to approve my withdrawals.</p>
<p>I rolled the bonus again and the draws were canceled again.</p>
<p>The amount of BGN 8,215 was honestly accumulated by me at Roulette before Svetlin misled me that the bonus had not been rolled over and that I had secured an unfairly guaranteed profit.</p>
<p>After another 30-40 turns, my balance dropped to BGN 300 and I still couldn't withdraw it. However, the problem is from the very beginning, when they lied to me that I won these BGN 8,215 by influencing roulette. That is why I claim for them.</p>
<p>Total in both cases: BGN 8881.</p>
