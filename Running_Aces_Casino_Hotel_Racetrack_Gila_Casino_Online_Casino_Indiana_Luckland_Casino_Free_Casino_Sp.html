<p>While North Carolina sports enthusiasts will not be able to place bets in time for the Super Bowl, the state is optimistic about launching online sports gambling before the much-anticipated March Madness</p>
<p>Two major online sportsbooks, DraftKings and BetMGM, have recently inked deals that pave the way for their operations in the Tar Heel State.</p>
<p>BetMGM Forges Strategic Alliance with Charlotte Motor Speedway</p>
<p>BetMGM, recognized as a leader in sports betting and iGaming, disclosed its strategic partnership with Charlotte Motor Speedway, a prominent motorsports and entertainment venue. The collaboration aims to bring BetMGM’s online sports betting platform to North Carolina once the state officially legalizes sports betting.</p>
<p>Greg Walter, Executive Vice President, and General Manager of Charlotte Motor Speedway, expressed enthusiasm about the venture, stating that the partnership with BetMGM would not only enhance the sports fan experience but also contribute to North Carolina’s tax revenue, support colleges, and attract major events.</p>
<p>BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt also commented. He said: “BetMGM’s partnership with Charlotte Motor Speedway meets a great demand for entertainment from North Carolinians. Together we will deliver a premier and responsible gaming product that benefits many state agencies.”</p>
<p>DraftKings Accelerates North Carolina Entry with NASCAR Partnership</p>
<p>Simultaneously, DraftKings, a major player in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industry, announced its partnership with NASCAR. The agreement involves a written designation agreement, marking a significant step toward DraftKings’ operations in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Matt Kalish, President of DraftKings North America, highlighted the shared commitment between DraftKings and NASCAR in enhancing the fan experience, expressing anticipation for providing their leading mobile sportsbook to North Carolina fans.</p>
<p>Upon launch, North Carolina would become the 27th state where DraftKings Sportsbook is operational, aligning with the company’s scheduled entry into Vermont on January 11.</p>
<p>North Carolina Sports Betting Committee Faces Tight Deadline for Launch Amid Operator Applications</p>
<p>These developments come shortly after the North Carolina Sports Betting Committee convened in 2024, adjusting the initial timeline for sports betting to be live after the Super Bowl. The state now faces a deadline of June 14 to finalize the necessary arrangements, with hopes of launching online sports betting in time for March Madness.</p>
<p>Seven operators, including BetMGM, DraftKings, ESPN BET, Fanatics, and FanDuel, have already applied for licenses in North Carolina. Industry experts acknowledge the challenges posed by regulatory compliance but emphasize the importance of ensuring that all operators understand and adhere to the state’s laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Additionally, FanDuel and the PGA Tour are set to collaborate in North Carolina‘s sports betting market, building on their existing partnership. This move aligns with North Carolina’s opening for sports betting operators to form partnerships, attracting both established companies as well as emerging operators.</p>
