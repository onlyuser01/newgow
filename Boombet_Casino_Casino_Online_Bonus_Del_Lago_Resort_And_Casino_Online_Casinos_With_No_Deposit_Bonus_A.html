    <h1>Boombet Casino Casino Online Bonus Del Lago Resort And Casino Online Casinos With No Deposit Bonus A</h1>

<p>Evolution is consolidating its presence on the newly-regulated Dutch gambling market with the supplier teaming up with Janshen-Hahnraths Group and the group’s Fair Play Casino brand. Evolution brings a rich portfolio of games and products as provided by its brands, NetEnt and Red Tiger.</p>
<p>Evolution will launch with its full selection of products, including the live casino suite, including games Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat Crazy Time, Monopoly Live, and other signature products that have helped Evolution stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>The partnership will similarly include the RNG and slot games by NetEnt and Red Tiger, to name Starburst, Narcos, Gonzo’s Quest, and Gonzo’s Quest Megaways, among other worthwhile additions.</p>
<p>Opportunity for Both Companies</p>
<p>Evolution’s commercial director, Gavin Hamilton, was quick to comment on the opportunity, arguing that the supplier was excited to be teaming up with both Fair Play Casino and the organization behind it, Janshen-Hahnraths Group. Hamilton argued that Evolution had been looking forward to joining the regulated online gambling market in the Netherlands and added:</p>
<p>“Our extensive online offering is a great fit for further developing their exciting games portfolio, and we look forward to achieving great new things together.” Evolution’s commercial director, Gavin Hamilton</p>
<p>Janshen-Hahnraths Group also welcomed the partnership and said that it had been looking for years to launch an online product in the Netherlands, but regulatory uncertainties may have served as a deterrent.</p>
<p>The group’s chief digital officer, Björn Fuchs, was excited about Fair Play being able to offer Dutch players a wide variety of “world-class online games.” He added:</p>
<p>“We are sure players will agree that the sheer quality and variety of the online games now available to our players on desktop and mobile at the Fair Play website has been well worth the wait.” Janshen-Hahnraths Group chief digital officer Björn Fuchs</p>
<p>The Janshen-Hahnraths Group is a well-established name in the land-based Dutch gambling market, with the group operating over 38 retail casinos under the Fair play Casinos brand. The venues pivot around the slots and automatic roulette experience.</p>
