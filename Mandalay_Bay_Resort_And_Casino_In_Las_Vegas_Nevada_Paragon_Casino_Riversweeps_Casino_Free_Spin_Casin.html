    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino In Las Vegas Nevada Paragon Casino Riversweeps Casino Free Spin Casin</h1>

<p>You should really let go of your way of always having to teach others.</p>
<p>Or pretending you're an expert making assumptions or pretending to be a teacher.</p>
<p>I don't bother to check my spelling for everyone.</p>
<p>Should really become a teacher if you feel better about pointing out mistakes to others.</p>
<p>Better that way with the spelling Professor? ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>I understand what the problem is, but you're clinging to the party frantically, even though you wrote his in one of your texts' Hello dear Casino-Guru team, I need your help.</p>
<p>After playing several times at GetSlots - depositing normally - I had 30 free spins (max. payout â‚¬100).'</p>
<p>You said it yourself 100â‚¬ SO why the theater here?</p>
<p>Since when are there casinos that give away free spins without a deposit and have no limit?</p>
<p>You say yourself that you've been playing there for a long time and now you want to claim that you didn't know?</p>
<p>For the fact that you have partly financed your life with gambling, it seems that you don't really know your way around :)</p>
<p>In fact, Getslots won't pay you out unless a miracle happens.</p>
<p>Otherwise, their terms and conditions are crystal clear. If you get free spins without deposit, you have a limit. After wagering the limit, the amount is reduced to the maximum win.</p>
<p>In EVERY casino, after this reduction you should cash out because it is the limit.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it converts to real money as this â‚¬100 limit will remain in place even after the wager has been wagered.</p>
<p>You say you've been playing for so long but keep gambling that â‚¬100 and then you're looking for holes to somehow get the money that getslots has rightly discounted you as their T&amp;Cs state exactly this rule.</p>
<p>Loyalty bonuses or whatever, ALL FREE SPINS WITHOUT DEPOSIT have a limit. Just like the free spins that you get WITH a deposit.</p>
<p>You're acting like you've been playing in casinos since yesterday and don't know your way around. :) If that were the case, it's not bad. But you are portraying yourself as a pro but complaining about a casino knowing full well that no deposit free spins have limits.</p>
<p>On top of that you mention in your text stuff how you came to Duxcasino through classybeef and Getslots through Guru. You act like guru is a little complicit, even though you're the only one who didn't read properly.</p>
<p>Saying things like 'Guru through you I came to the Casino Getslots so do something ^^.</p>
<p>Do you notice what you are saying or do you really think you are smart and all other idiots ?!?</p>
<p>It's obvious it's annoying.</p>
<p>But just as you accuse the casino of being a scammer, I accuse you of negligent action.</p>
<p>I know for a fact you knew that this bonus has a limit or when else have you ever received no deposit free spins that had no limit??..</p>
<p>You're trying desperately to get the money, even if you deny it.</p>
<p>You warn players against playing there even though it's one of the best in my opinion.</p>
<p>You make a mistake, but blame everyone else &amp; want to get the money from the casino that you are claiming to be a scammer. You assume something for everyone, but you're the poor victim here (of course ^^).</p>
<p>You have accused me of streaming for the casino and I am only commenting on what is wrong as I have NOT streamed for ANY casino and am just recording my sessions in case there are any issues.</p>
<p>But you know everything and like to blame people or put them down because you think you're better.</p>
<p>You're through below at Getslots and all other sister casinos, so much for that.</p>
<p>There is a saying 'man ðŸ’© not in the hand that feeds you'.</p>
<p>They will also not put up with you portraying them as scammers and warning players to play there.</p>
<p>Look for the smallest mistake to be able to exploit it.</p>
<p>My opinion remains that I think it's ridiculous and won't say anything further because I don't want to be insulted directly and indirectly by a would-be professional because it thinks it's something better and like a toddler likes it Blame others and act like you didn't know anything.</p>
<p>PS: I don't bother to check my spelling anymore for you.</p>
<p>So if that bothers you, apply to be a teacher and there you can play the cool kid who has to correct everyone because he thinks he's smart.</p>
<p>Good luck with your complaint.</p>
