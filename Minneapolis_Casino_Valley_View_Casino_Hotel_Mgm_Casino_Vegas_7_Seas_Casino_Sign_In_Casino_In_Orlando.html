    <h1>Minneapolis Casino Valley View Casino Hotel Mgm Casino Vegas 7 Seas Casino Sign In Casino In Orlando</h1>

<p>Hey you!</p>
<p>I feel for you my man. It' s never easy to hear someone else open up about their gambling demons. Its very important tho to do what you are doing, open up and talk about it.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, most of us gambling jerks, has at some point lost more money than we could afford. Thats just part of the game. And as of for my worst experience, I lost way way waaaay to much. So much so that I sat down, told all of my family and grinda what had happend. Then I broke everything down and started to figure out what went wrong and what Ive could have done diffrently.</p>
<p>First of I was like you. Eager to find a way out no matter what, but I realized that only made me feel sad and angry. I also realized that I play just because it is fun, because why waste your time in life doing something you dont even like?</p>
<p>This is where my true love and passion for gambling slowly cameback. I had taken controll over my feelings. My luck started to turn and I saw oppertunitys instead of obsticles. I was having fun again and that was a huge win, eventhough I was a years away from having the bankroll that I once have had.</p>
<p>My biggest tip for you my friend: If you are not feeling it, leave it. Do something that make you smile. Take a break. Take controll and learn from misstakes. We all do them and will always make new once. Jusy dont repeat the same one over and over, you are the boss over yourself!!</p>
<p>Much love.</p>
<p>Life is about smiles and kisses, not cash and freespins.</p>
