<p>Zitro, a company that specializes in the production and delivery of outstanding games for the land-based sector through its state-of-the-art gaming machines, has expanded its reach in the Colombian market through a new tie-up with Vicca Group.</p>

<p>Zitro’s Regional Director for Latin America, Alejandra Burato, was similarly pleased with this opportunity and she said that it was great to see Vicca Group entrust Zitro with the delivery of more of the supplier’s gaming machines.</p>
<p>In fact, Burato said that Vicca Group’s brands and their players have already embraced the Zitro slots and were keen to explore new opportunities as well. Burato thanked Vicca Group for the opportunity to continue on this partnership together and continue to deliver top-performing games for Vicca Group and its many brands, across their numerous casino floors.</p>
<p>Zitro has been scaling up its presence in Latin America, with the company recently teaming up with Sportium Colombia, another prominent operator in the country.
