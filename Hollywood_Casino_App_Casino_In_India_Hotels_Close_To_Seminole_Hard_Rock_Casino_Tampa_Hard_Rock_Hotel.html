    <h1>Hollywood Casino App Casino In India Hotels Close To Seminole Hard Rock Casino Tampa Hard Rock Hotel</h1>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>They do not specify what the error is in the document I sent, they only give me a "robotic" response that it is not original, that I sent the correct document, otherwise no further action can be taken and the last thing was that they would ignore any subsequent email.</p>
<p>I tried to make the first withdrawal on November 20, but when they asked me for the account statement with the movement made to the account, the card had not yet made the cut, therefore the account statement with the movement did not exist, so I waited Until November 16, I already had the account statement to try again and until now without any success.</p>
<p>The curious thing about the case is that at first they asked me for the account statement or capture of the movement (I am assuming that the account statement does not yet exist because the card had not been cut) and it was still rejected.</p>
<p>One point should be clarified, I had a 1xBet account, with two-step verification, after changing cell phones, I did not recover the Google Authenticator accounts and I could no longer access that account, when I sent emails for help they did not respond and I created another account. After creating this account that I currently use, they respond and remove the 2-step verification from account 1 so I can log in. Then they send me an email saying that it is illegal to have two accounts (which I agree with) and there is no option to delete the account and I send an email saying that I want to delete account 1 and they answer that I must unite the accounts. accounts and that is when I start the email thread from my current account to verify.</p>
<p>Note 1. Account 1 never received money</p>
<p>Note 2. In a phone call with the casino they tell me that I must verify my account to make the union and then they tell me that I cannot do the verification because I have two accounts, so they locked me in an endless cycle.</p>
