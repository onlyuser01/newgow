<p>JooSports, a subsidiary of JooCasino, and part of N1 Partners Group is the first to integrate the brand-new Sportsbook Platform by SoftSwiss.</p>
<p>Unique User-friendly Features by SoftSwiss Sportsbook Platform</p>
<p>JooSports is the first brand to use SoftSwiss Sportsbook Platform, the supplier said in an official release. The company believes that by this integration, it will increase conversion rates and usability. JooSports will benefit from high-quality customer support, better fraud prevention, as well as full risk-control. SoftSwiss also made the platform flexible and easy to customize.</p>
<p>The development, which took two years, showed that there is a significant growth of bets placed through mobile devices. Thus, SoftSwiss developers took their observations into consideration and made the sportsbook and made the platform mobile-friendly, with the conviction it will make it more usable.</p>
<p>JooSports’ integration with the platform will provide players with an exceptional experience and customization based on preferences. Bettors also have the user-friendly “Favorite” section where they will be able to add the events that are most interesting to them. Players will also have access to 60 different sports from over 1200 markets, which will also be susceptible to updates. The platform will support 11 languages and 20 payment methods. Betraider is chosen as the main odds feeds provider.</p>
<p>Seamless Transition between Casino Websites and Sportsbook Platform</p>
<p>The JooSports’ integration with SoftSwiss Sportsbook Platform will also provide customers with a unique and user-friendly experience. A seamless transition option between Sportsbook and JooCasino will be provided through the interface of the latter, which is also powered by SoftSwiss. Consumers will be able to access all platforms from a single-entry point available on all websites, creating a ‘single ecosystem’. In addition to the smooth transition, the platform also includes incentive features such as Bet Builder, Maxbet, and Cashout.</p>
<p>Alexey Shlapunov, CEO of N1 Partners also stated that this partnership will be highly-beneficent to JooSports players as they will receive flexibility and excellent quality service and this will have a positive impact on the company in the future.</p>
<p>Sportsbook by SoftSwiss is on the Verge of Success</p>
<p>SoftSwiss has a high ambition for its project to become one of the most successful platforms on the sports betting market. With JooSports as its first sportsbook platform client, the company wishes to gain momentum and give players worldwide the opportunity to use these unique features of mobile-friendliness, flexibility, and customization options.</p>
<p>SoftSwiss has gathered a lot of experience in the iGaming industry and has combined knowledge with a futuristic outlook to pack its Sportsbook Platform with such customization and modern functionality that are highly competitive on the market today.</p>
