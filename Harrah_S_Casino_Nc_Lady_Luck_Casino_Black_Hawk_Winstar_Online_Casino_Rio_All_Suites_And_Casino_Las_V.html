<p>Esports Technologies, a provider of engaging and unique wagering experiences to the esports gambling industry, has officially changed its name to EBET. The company believes the new name better reflects its vision.</p>
<p>Esports Technologies Is Now EBET</p>
<p>According to EBET, the rebranding will allow it to better show what it stands for and will improve its appeal to younger audiences. Furthermore, it demonstrates the company’s decision to expand its offerings and provide casino and sports games alongside its esports products.</p>
<p>This move is expected to broaden EBET’s audience and allow it to connect with more people, especially those from its target Millennial and Gen Z audiences. The branding is with an immediate effect starting May 5. As a celebration of its new brand name, EBET has also refreshed its site and logo.</p>
<p>Aaron Speach, the company’s chief executive officer, said that his team is assured that there is no better time to do a rebranding than now. According to him, EBET reflects what the company is doing far better and will “perfectly illustrate” its growing ambition to serve younger bettors.</p>
<p>EBET’s Strategy Continues to Reap Successes</p>
<p>Esports Technologies, or EBET, is poised for growth thanks to its highly successful operations in 2021. The period saw EBET double down on its operations in Europe – a key market for its long-term strategy. In October 2021, the company announced that it will open a new office in Malta, one of the biggest gambling hubs on the continent. A few months later, EBET successfully acquired a license to operate in the important UK market, which immediately boosted the price of the company’s shares.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, EBET purchased Aspire Global’s business-to-customer brands, which marked the beginning of its foray into more diverse betting offerings. The deal saw EBET pay $75.9 million for this critical acquisition. Throughout the year, EBET also purchased a variety of other casino and sports betting brands, such as BetTarget, Dansk777, GenerationVIP, Griffon Casino, Hopa and Karamba, which helped it reach more than a million new customers across a dozen countries.</p>
<p>Last year, EBET committed to innovation by applying for several tech patents. In November, the company applied for a betting exchange system patent, followed by one for multiplayer battle games.</p>
<p>Analysts predict a decent year for EBET as forecasts show that the company might earn as much as $70 million by the end of September this year. Some expect this number to go up as EBET continues to innovate, expand, diversify its offerings and sign strategic M&amp;A deals.</p>
