    <h1>Harrah S Cherokee Hotel And Casino Caribbean Casino Resorts Cash Frenzy Casino Casinos In Pa Las Veg</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a huge problem with the casino -&gt; Casombie &lt;-...</p>
<p>On April 27th, 2021 I had a € 10,000 win at Bonanza on a € 6 stake.</p>
<p>Everything legitimately deposited through my bank account and no bonuses or other used.</p>
<p>After I sent my documents to Casombie for verification (personal front and back, mobilcom debitel mobile phone bill for proof of address and account statement for proof of bank account) I received an email that said I would allegedly play via vpn and I would should turn off.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I don't even know what vpn is, on the other hand, I don't use it and mainly play on my iPhone 11 Pro.</p>
<p>After several emails and asking that you explain to me how we do it, there is still no solution.</p>
<p>After streamers promoting the casino asked the casino for processing and help, a manager told me to log on to another device or to a public wifi.</p>
<p>I did this today via my father's pc and my father's cell phone, after which I received an email with the following content: "Dear Christian</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to our Casombie support team.</p>
<p>We apologize, but there are no German speaking agents available at the moment. That's why we play it for you in English. Sorry for the problem that you caused.</p>
<p>We would like to inform you that you should no longer use encryption services that may hide your location as this could result in the closure of your account.</p>
<p>Please use your protocol with your real IP as you did recently. "</p>
<p>I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong and I also don't understand the last sentence ...</p>
<p>If I did it correctly recently, why wasn't my account verified?</p>
<p>I have never had problems with verification, payouts and not to mention ip address problems and I have had payouts that are in the high range several times.</p>
<p>Please help me...</p>
<p>You are my last rescue: '(</p>
