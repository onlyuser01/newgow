<p>Unlike the previous four rounds of the 2022-23 Premier League, Round 4 is on the program in the middle of the week. It kicks off on Tuesday, August 30, with four matchups, the most interesting of which seems to be the one taking place at St. Mary’s Stadium in Southampton. That’s where Southampton will welcome Chelsea, hoping to get revenge for the humiliating 6-0 loss in their previous meeting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Saints, bookies don’t think it’s going to happen. Instead, they expect the Blues from London to get all three points from their trip to the South Coast. But what do we think is going to happen in the Southampton vs Chelsea game? To find out, make sure to read this EPL preview until the very end.</p>

<p>Southampton Playing Good Soccer Despite Unimpressive Record</p>
<p>After four rounds of the 2022-23 Premier League, Southampton has just four points. The Saints have one win, one draw, and two losses so far, with a score difference of 5-8. However, despite the not-too-great stats, these guys have been decent on the field in almost every game they’ve played so far.</p>
<p>Their worst performance was in Round 1 when they lost to Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 in London. They did get an early lead in that match, but the Spurs then switched up a gear and completely obliterated them.</p>
<p>However, in Round 2, the Saints played a 2-2 draw with Leeds United, which is one of the biggest overachievers of the 2022-23 season. In Round 3, Southampton players got their first win of the season – they beat Leicester City 2-1 on the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, celebrations didn’t last too long as they lost another game a week later. Last Saturday, they lost a home game to Manchester United. Still, the final score was just 1-0 for the Red Devils, while the Saints put on a pretty good performance that afternoon. They played attacking soccer and had 17 goal attempts, which is six more than Man United.</p>
<p>Thomas Tuchel is Back in Charge of Chelsea</p>
<p>The FA fined Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel with a one-game suspension for the scrap he had with Tottenham’s boss Antonio Conte in the second round of the Prem. For that reason, the German coach had to skip last Saturday’s game with Leicester City. Three days later, however, he’s back in his job post.</p>
<p>Tuchel is going to be there, but Chelsea’s young midfielder Conor Gallagher will not. The 22-year-old got sent off during Chelsea’s 2-1 win over the Foxes on Saturday. He got a red card in the first half when it was 0-0 on the scoreboard, but 10-men Chelsea was still able to get a win.</p>
<p>Southampton vs. Chelsea Prediction</p>
<p>The Blues are going to South Coast to collect all three points, but their job isn’t going to be easy. Southampton are going to fight back, which is why this game could turn out to be a very entertaining affair, possible with plenty of goals.</p>
<p>Picks: Chelsea to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
