<p>The United States have a chance to qualify for the World Cup knockouts for the seventh time in history. The only way that can happen is if they beat Iran on Tuesday afternoon. The thing is that Iran are one point ahead of them, so anything but a win would mean the USMNT having to pack their bags.</p>

<p>Iran Players Encouraged by a 2-0 Win Over Wales</p>
<p>The 2022 World Cup started badly for Iran, who got thrashed by England 6-2. In Round 2, however, they won all three points against Wales. As a result, they’re now second in Group B, with one point behind England and one point more than Team US. Wales are sitting at the bottom of the group table with just one point.</p>
<p>Iran got their three points by beating Gareth Bale &amp; Co. 2-0 on Friday. If you didn’t watch the game, you might think it was a dominant performance by Iran, but that wasn’t exactly the case. Iran and Wales were two even until late in the game.</p>
<p>What happened there was that Wales’ goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey received a red card in the 86th minute of the game. With 10 men on the pitch, Wales had to get on the back foot. They defended ferociously until Iran finally managed to break their defensive wall in the 8th minute of the stoppage time.</p>
<p>Being 1-0 down, Gareth Bale and his teammates had no other option but to go all-out attack. That didn’t pay off – Iran got them on the break scoring the second goal in the final minute of the game.</p>
<p>Now’s the Time for USMNT Stars to Shine</p>
<p>The game with Iran is when the USMNT players need to show what they’re made of. After two draws, now is the time for the Americans to win. Anything other than win would mean their World Cup adventure is over.</p>
<p>So, can they do it? In the first two games, they showed that they do have an excellent midfield. They were able to shut down the playmakers of Wales and England, letting them create only a limited number of chances.</p>
<p>We expect them to do the same against Iran. That said, the real challenge in this game will be to find the net. Wales failed to do so against Iran, will Americans do better?</p>
<p>The USMNT do have some talented attackers on the roster – Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Josh Sargent, and others. They just need to be more clinical.</p>
<p>Iran vs USMNT Prediction</p>
<p>The USMNT need to go for a win in this game. For the first time in this tournament, we’re going to see them attack with all they got. And they do have a lot of power in the final third. That’s why we expect them to get to their first win of the 2022 World Cup on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pick: USMNT to win</p>
