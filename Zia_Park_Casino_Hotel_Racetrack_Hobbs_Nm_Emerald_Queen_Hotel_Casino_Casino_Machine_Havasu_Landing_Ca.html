<p>The provider of turnkey gaming solutions has significantly expanded the range of available iGaming titles on its Ontario-licensed platform</p>
<p>Mobinc’s masterstroke in the Canadian province will now see it offer a number of games from some of the most prominent suppliers in the iGaming industry. Among those are names such as Hacksaw, Push Gaming, Quickspin, Pragmatic Play and Relax Gaming all of which are now available on the Ontario-licensed platform.</p>
<p>Mobinc Strikes Massive Content Partnership in Ontario</p>
<p>This will have immediate benefits for both players and casinos. Quickspin was able to negotiate a partnership that will allow one of its flagship titles, Sakura Fortune, to also be featured as the official Welcome Bonus Free Spins offer for the province, too.</p>
<p>The integration is naturally welcomed by Mobinc which will give its content platform a significant boost. The company is also confident about its long-term prospects in what it describes as one of the most promising North American markets.</p>
<p>Mobinc CEO Sergei Belikov has hailed the recent developments and said that content is certainly king. He explained that online casino players are constantly on the lookout for new and promising content that can add to the value of their experiences online.</p>
<p>The recent additions were all worthwhile choices that Belikov expects will strike home with audiences in Ontario. His exact words were:</p>
<p>These studios need little introduction to operators, having been responsible for creating many of the best games in recent years, and will make us far more attractive to companies hoping to take advantage of Ontario without the expense of getting their own license. Mobinc CEO Sergei Belikov</p>
<p>Mobinc Is a Solid Technological and Gaming Partner</p>
<p>The latest integrations have been done in line with Mobinc’s commitment to ensuring that it maintains player safety and regulatory compliance across the board. Today, Mobinc provides a range of solutions, including a 24/7 cloud-hosted gaming platform and the means to allow partners to build cutting-edge Android and iOS applications and mobile websites.</p>
<p>Mobinc’s content platform already boasts a fantastic variety of games with more than 3,000 titles and the company holds multiple licenses, including from regulators such as the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, the Malta Gaming Authority, and the UK Gambling Commission. Mobinc previously added Push Gaming as a supplier for its turnkey platform.</p>
