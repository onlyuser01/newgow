<p>Fire Hopper review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Fire Hopper is themed around frogs and their marshy home.</p>
<p>Players will drift into an idyllic natural scene and see gently flowing water, bullrushes, and plenty of water lilies. With the help of some very unique frogs, they’ll navigate the eerily beautiful setting.</p>
<p>This slot is a great choice for nature lovers and players looking for a relaxed vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The ambient soundtrack is filled with a bird song and the hum of insects reinforcing the swamp setting. The reels spin with the sloshing sound of water, and cheerful music kicks in for special features.</p>
<p>Behind the reels, players will see blue-green water slowly drifting, as if they are hovering above the landscape. Lily pads, rocks, and swaying bullrushes all add to the marshy setting.</p>
<p>The reels are filled with water lily symbols animated with bright hues and dainty angles that bring to mind origami. The brightly-patterned frogs steal the show with adorably solemn expressions and darting tongues.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, the landscape transforms from sunny daylight to twilight, allowing the fireflies to showcase their glow.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack of Fire Hopper create a whimsical and dreamy natural world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Fire Hopper has a 7x7 grid reel structure. Wins are awarded for landing clusters of matching symbols.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that symbols that form winning combinations are removed from the reels. This allows new symbols to fall into their positions from above.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild Frog symbol and Wild Gold Frog symbol substitute for all symbols except the Firefly symbol and the Bonus Firefly symbol.</p>
<p>The Firefly symbol is non-paying, but it contributes to triggering the Leaping Frog feature. Meanwhile, the Bonus Firefly symbol is also non-paying, but can contribute to triggering the Leaping Frog feature as well as offering a bonus for collection.</p>
<p>The Leaping Frog feature begins when a Frog symbol appears along with a Firefly symbol and Instant Prize symbol or Bonus Firefly symbol.</p>
<p>Every Frog symbol is accompanied by a multiplier which increases during the Leaping Frog feature.</p>
<p>When a Frog symbol leaps to the Instant Prize, players win an Instant Prize symbol which can carry a variety of values.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins with 7 free spins when a Frog symbol collects a Bonus Firefly symbol.</p>
<p>The maximum win is x50,000 the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.3%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€20.00 per spin.</p>
<p>Coming in with high volatility, Fire Hopper is a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, high volatility frog-themed slot.</p>
<p>With a dreamy setting, respectable RTP, and strategy-friendly volatility, Fire Hopper is a great pick.</p>
<p>The grumpily adorable frogs make the front end endearing, while the variety of bonus features keeps the gameplay engaging.</p>
