<p>Shaker Club, a “Real Party Starter”</p>
<p>As described by the studio’s chief gaming officer, Mark McGinley, the new game introduces players to the old-school, classic style of playing slots improved with “a huge climbing multiplier” meant to significantly spice up the action on the reels.</p>
<p>The game came as a result of Yggdrasil’s intention to constantly breathe diversity into the gameplay and themes of all of its games, and its main goal is to serve up “ice-cold wins” to players.</p>
<p>The action takes place in a busy cocktail bar with fancy drinks enjoyed by the mingling patrons who are seen dancing in the background. To form a winning combo, players must land a minimum of three identical symbols on adjacent reels starting with the leftmost reel.</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols on the 3×5 grid are represented by the classic cards in the form of spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts. Players who hit a win with five identical symbols are rewarded with 1X the bet.</p>
<p>The high-paying symbols are represented by the blue, green, orange, and red drinks, where a five-of-a-kind trigger wins between 3X and 10X the bet. The game’s wild symbol is represented by the bartender while the golden shaker is the scatter.</p>
<p>To trigger the bonus round, players need a minimum of three Free Spins symbols. The more of these symbols land on the reels, the higher the starting multiplier.</p>
<p>During the bonus game, the shaker’s multiplier starts at x25 and can reach a whopping value of 250x without any resets between the spins.</p>
<p>When the Free Spins mode is initiated, players are given the choice to gamble their spins for a chance to get a higher starting multiplier. They can also progress straight to the bonus using a dedicated buy bonus feature, with a random starting multiplier ranging from 100x to 600x.</p>
<p>The winner of the Innovator of the Year Award at IGA 2023 continuously expands its offering on a global level using key value propositions that offer boosted scalability, fresh revenue opportunities, and worldwide growth via IP licensing.</p>
