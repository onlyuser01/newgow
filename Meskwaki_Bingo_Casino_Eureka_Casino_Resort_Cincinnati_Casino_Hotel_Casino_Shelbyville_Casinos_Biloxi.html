    <h1>Meskwaki Bingo Casino Eureka Casino Resort Cincinnati Casino Hotel Casino Shelbyville Casinos Biloxi</h1>

<p>Dear rebeccatolieelf,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting this complaint. I'm sorry to hear about your negative experience. Please allow me to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand your situation completely.</p>
<p>I have checked the Responsible Gaming section of Winsly Casino, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>Permanent Self-Exclusion/Account Closure</p>
<p>Any player can request us to permanently close their account by talking to our support team via chat or email. This decision cannot be reversed, and we ask that you withdraw any remaining funds before taking this action.</p>
<p>If you have accounts at any of our sister brands, we also recommend you let our support team know; they can close these for you too. Likewise, we advise you to close any other gambling accounts held with other operators.</p>
<p>We further encourage you to remove yourself from any environment in which gambling is promoted (for example, following gambling brands on social media).</p>
<p>Have you requested to be self-excluded in Winsly Casino as well?</p>
<p>Could you kindly forward me the emails with the request to close your accounts in any of Winsly Casino's sister brands? My email address is veronika.l@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Veronika</p>
