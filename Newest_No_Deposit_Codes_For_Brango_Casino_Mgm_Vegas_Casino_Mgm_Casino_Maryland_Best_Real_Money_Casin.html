<p>Aztec Sun Hold and Win Slot Review</p>
<p>Released in June 2020 by the progressive game studio responsible for the creation of a large number of excellent cross-platform HD video slots Booongo, Aztec Sun Hold and Win is packed with free spins, a bonus game, and a Grand jackpot of x1000 waiting to be grabbed.</p>
<p>The 3×5 game with 25 pay lines is ready to reveal all the hidden secrets and tales of the fascinating Aztec temples. We have carefully tested the game for you and we warmly invite you to check our detailed review below to learn more.</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Discover the Power of the Aztec Sun</p>
<p>The game has the popular Aztec theme in place, a theme that is preferred by a large number of players thanks to the mesmerizing massive sculptures and the miniature gemstone insects carved in them. The game’s theme also features stylized hand-crafted pots, eye-catching gold and silver accessories, and amazing garments covered in feathers.</p>
<p>The Aztec sun, which is the central point of the slot, was worshipped by the Aztecs as the main source of life. The Aztecs also thought that Tonatiuh, the sun deity that ruled the sky during the day as well as the cardinal direction of the East, represented the most important of all their gods. While he offered soothing warmth and sustenance, he also demanded blood sacrifices from the Aztec people.</p>
<p>Booongo’s Aztec Sun Hold and Win slot, therefore, introduces players to these eye-catching elements while the storyline in itself refers to players going on a hunt for Aztec treasures. The fully immersive gameplay and well-balanced math model chosen for the game make it an excellent pastime for most players.</p>
<p>Aztec Sun: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The game’s high-paying symbols are the Pyramid scatter symbol, the wild symbol represented by the Snake Wild, a Bird symbol, a Predator, a Fish, and a Gold Idol. The game counts four low-paying symbols represented by the Royal Card symbols from A to J. The low-paying symbols pay between 0.20x and 2x the bet while the high-paying symbols (pyramids, fish, predators, gold idols) bring players payouts between 240x and 600x for five of a kind.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack chosen for the slot is a fast-paced one with plenty of Aztec influences that remind players of the mystical songs performed by the Aztec tribes when worshiping the forces of nature and their impressive pyramids. The sounds that are heard in a repetitive loop are interrupted every time players come across special symbols, features, or important wins in the game when they are replaced by even more engaging sounds.</p>
<p>The animations are engaged when players reveal identical symbols on the reels set against the beautiful background with ancient drawings and deity imagery drawn on it. The animations interrupt the standard gameplay whenever players manage to successfully trigger the available features such as the free spins or when they enter the Bonus Game. The sound can be toggled on and off with the help of the speaker icon seen to the right.</p>
<p>Aztec Sun Gameplay</p>
<p>Players need to click or tap the small “i” right-hand corner button to access detailed information about the game. There, they will also have the chance to consult the rules of the game as well as the paytable.</p>
<p>To access the game in autoplay mode, players can easily select the green settings icon found in the vertical panel underneath the Spin button to the right. To stop the auto spin, players must click the same button and watch it turn red while the Stop symbol will appear on it.</p>
<p>Players can also change the amount they would like to bet using the +/- signs to the sides of the BET button located in the bottom right. It is also possible to opt for the stacked coins symbol alternative located to the far right and choose a different amount from the table displaying all the available bets ranging from 0.10 to 60.</p>
<p>To engage in the gameplay, players need to click or tap the large green SPIN button located on the vertical panel. At the bottom, the game displays players’ Balance and Last Wins.</p>
<p>Aztec Sun Hold and Win Free Spins and Bonuses</p>
<p>Aztec Sun offers Free Spins that can be retriggered, along with a Bonus Game and three possible Jackpots: Mini, Major, and Grand. Three Scatter symbols represented by the Pyramids landing anywhere on the second, third, or fourth reels will trigger eight free spins. Replicating the same scatters on the same reels while engaged in free spins will bring players eight more free spins. The Bonus Game can be triggered during the Free Spins round.</p>
<p>Bonus Game</p>
<p>Coming across a minimum of six bonus symbols will trigger the Bonus Game. All Bonus symbols will stick to the reels that will only have these symbols appearing on them during the Bonus Game. The potential values of the multipliers run from 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 10x, 14x, 16x, 18x, 20x and 25x total bet.</p>
<p>The start of the Bonus Game brings players three respins. Each fresh Bonus symbol popping on the reels will automatically reset the number of respins to three. The Bonus Game will carry on until all 15 Bonus symbols will be collected or until all the respins are finished.</p>
<p>Mini, Major, and Grand Jackpots</p>
<p>The game also features three jackpots. The Mini jackpot can show up randomly during the Bonus Game, bringing players x30 their total bet. The Major jackpot awards players with a win consisting of x50 the total bet. To collect the Grand jackpot, players need to come across all 15 symbols in the Bonus Game for an x1000 total bet payout</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>With excellent game features and equally satisfying graphics embedded in the captivating Aztec temple theme, Aztec Sun Hold and Win is a Booongo slot worth a try. The game’s RTP can be considered rather mediocre. In spite of the mouth-watering jackpots and high multipliers, players are recommended to wait for the additional stage with cool flaming coins to enjoy the higher payout potential. This is particularly true when the jackpots or bonus symbols with large bet multipliers are seen popping on the reels.</p>
