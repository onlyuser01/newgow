<p>Montezuma review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot is themed on Aztec culture and one of its famous emperors.</p>
<p>Surrounded by jungle foliage, players are met with stoic golden masks, intricate headdresses, and a watchful hawk. A mysterious young woman looks out from the reels, ready to show players around the exotic world.</p>
<p>The portrayal of Aztec culture is definitely more cinematic than realistic, but players will enjoy getting into the spirit. The atmosphere of a steamy wilderness comes across well, even if it is a fantasy.</p>
<p>Win in the Montezuma slot machine</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The symbols are animated with enticing detail and vivid colour. An Aztec pyramid looms ominously and a golden toothed creature smiles grins like a Cheshire cat. The Montezuma symbol is statuesque in his rainbow hued hawk headdress. He has an effortless charisma and leaves no doubt he’s worthy of legend.</p>
<p>The jungle that surrounds the reels is shadowy and unobtrusive. A glow among the leaves suggests that the players are in a magical place.</p>
<p>The background sound is subtle bird calls that create an immersive atmosphere. Upon spins a series of lively beats add tension. Players are likely to enjoy these musical additions and keep them on.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and sound effects keep this slot a fun place to be.</p>
<p>Wild symbol and 2 highest paying symbols are stacked on reels to maximize the winning potential of the game</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Montezuma is a five reel, three row slot, with thirty win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay feels slower as a result of the pace of the reels spin. When the player hits spin, the reels seem to drift around rather than enthusiastically spin. This may be fun for players who enjoy seeing each symbol go by. However, others may prefer that the game move along faster.</p>
<p>The other consequence of the slower feeling is a slightly dizzying effect that is not found in most slots. Some players may not mind, but it may intrude on the gameplay experience of others.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Bonus symbols. The Wild symbol will only appear on reels 2-4.</p>
<p>Landing three or more scattered Bonus symbols triggers free spins.</p>
<p>At the beginning of every spin, players will see a wheel above the reels decide the spin Multiplier. The player’s free spins are granted a multiplier based on the spin of the wheel.</p>
<p>Landing two or more Bonus symbols awards the player additional free spins:</p>
<p>Three Bonus symbols = x3 total bet</p>
<p>Four Bonus symbols = x10 total bet</p>
<p>Five Bonus symbols = x10 total bet</p>
<p>The Bonus Guarantee means that any feature that ends with less than x10 the player’s bet will pay out x10 the total bet by the end of that feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 95.86%, almost equal to our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.30 up to a maximum of $/£/€60.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is high, which makes it a good match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Paytable for high paying symbols in the game</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>With colourful animation and an exotic atmosphere, Montezuma makes up for its slight lack of strategy-friendly stats.</p>
<p>The more leisurely paced gameplay won’t be for everyone, but those in the mood to savour the experience will enjoy the bird calls of the jungle.</p>
<p>Overall, we recommend this average RTP, high volatility Aztec-themed slot.</p>
