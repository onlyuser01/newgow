<p>888 casino is adding a new iGaming partner in the face of Microgaming and expanding an already formidable portfolio.</p>
<p>888 Casino and Microgaming Team Up for the UK</p>
<p>One of the UK’s leading casino companies, 888, has signed up an exciting new gaming partnership with software maker Microgaming. Microgaming is famous for some of the most memorable casino progressive jackpots in the world of online casinos.</p>
<p>888 has a variety of proprietor slots that the company has developed internally. 888 also partners with NetEnt, Evolution Gaming, and others but this is the first time the company has turned to the other leading iGaming developer Microgaming.</p>
<p>888 plans to roll out Microgaming products on both its domestic market in the United Kingdom but seek to expand further in Denmark and the newly-regulated Swedish online casino industry. Microgaming has a variety of franchised slots, such as Game of Thrones, Jurassic World and a variety of table games.</p>
<p>We are proud to announce that @888casino is now live with Microgaming's award-winning content, including hundreds of diverse titles and access to the world’s largest progressive jackpot network.https://t.co/a8aFwRmzr3#Microgaming #888Casino #newoperator #igaming pic.twitter.com/QxenKtNT2q — Microgaming (@Microgaming) April 4, 2019</p>
<p>The company has also created some of the most famous progressive jackpots, to name the four different iterations of Mega Moolah, King Cashalot and Jackpot Deuces. The Microgaming network has dished out over $150 million in just Mega Moolah prizes, making it one of the largest.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden aren’t the only markets where 888 operates with the company’s portfolio driving forays into Spain and Italy, despite a rather tightening regulatory climate.</p>
<p>Microgaming and 888 Embrace New Opportunities</p>
<p>Microgaming CEO John Coleman has shown confidence in Microgaming’s prospects as a dominant force in the iGaming market. Here’s what he had to say, commenting on the latest deal between his company and 888:</p>
<p>I am confident that this will be the start of a positive strategic relationship which will further strengthen the Microgaming brand across Europe, and I look forward to providing 888 with even more of our innovative, popular content in the coming months.</p>
<p>Beating negative forecasts, 888 showed resilient financial results despite the continuous legal buffeting across stringent legal markets.</p>
<p>The casino managed to amass $317.6 million in 2018 in revenue, a respectable sum. The last time 888’s financial performance was affected was back in 2016, but even then, revenue kept growing, even though profits slowed down a little.</p>
<p>The company has also driven forays with its poker and casino platform across the Atlantic in places like New Jersey and 888 is all ready to launch its offer in Pennsylvania in mid-2019 when the state gives a final go-ahead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Microgaming has continued to grow, expanding into new markets and looking to consolidate its footprint in already existing places. Microgaming entered the Czech Republic in February, teaming up with local betting operator Tipsport.</p>
<p>The company has equally found partners in other vibrant markets, including Bulgaria and Colombia as well as others that overlap with 888’s own operations, i.e. Denmark and Sweden.</p>
