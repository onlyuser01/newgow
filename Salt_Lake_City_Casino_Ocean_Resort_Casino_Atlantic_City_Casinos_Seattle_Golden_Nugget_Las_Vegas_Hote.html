<p>Yggdrasil and G Games have teamed up to introduce iGaming fans to the Tiger Tiger slot, a brand-new jungle-themed game by the companies. As the latest installment in the YG Masters series, the game will come with a distinguishable character, plot twists, and design elements.</p>
<p>Tiger Tiger is the first game by G Games for the YG Masters program since the two partnered in 2020. The studio was formerly known as Gamevy and Tiger Tiger slot uses the GATI system developed by Yggdrasil to allow for quick, pre-configured integration in targeted markets. Yggdrasil head of products and programs Stuart McCarthy said:</p>
<p>“Tiger Tiger is a feature-packed game with attractive jackpots and big win potential coupled with stunning design and illustrations of majestic jungle animals.” Yggdrasil head of products and programs Stuart McCarthy</p>
<p>McCarthy welcomed the slot adding that Yggdrasil has significantly improved their YG Masters portfolio through this latest arrival.</p>
<p>Tiger Tiger Slot Gameplay and Mechanics</p>
<p>From the start, players will be running side by side with a female adventurer who will try to spot out prizes out from afar, the coveted tiger symbols that are linked to the highest possible reward from the game. The Golden Tiger symbol plays the role of a scatter, appearing on reels 2, 3 and 4, and leading to 10 free spins.</p>
<p>Once you unlock the free spins you will have access to more treats, including cash prizes as well as the special Cash Collect symbols which, not surprisingly, add to your winning potential as you play along. There seems to be no limit on how many times you can retrigger the feature during the free spins rounds.</p>
<p>To add to the excitement, Tiger Tiger will have four jackpot offers that you can get to through the Quickhit and Money Collect symbols. Each Quickhit symbol has its own unique value and they work with the Monkey symbol which together leads to the Quickhit Collect bonus feature.</p>
<p>There is your chance to win a jackpot equal to 1,000 of your stake. As to the wild symbol, that is the Hidden Tiger option which can drop on reels 2, 3, or 4 and substitute for anything but the scatter.</p>
<p>G Games CCO Helen Walton commented on the release welcoming the launch with YG Masters and what she described as an impressive network of operators and the opportunities to collaborate. As a result, Walton said, the company would be able to distribute its products to new audiences.</p>
