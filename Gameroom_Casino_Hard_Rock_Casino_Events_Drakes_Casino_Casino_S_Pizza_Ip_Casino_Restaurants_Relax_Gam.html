<p>The fast-growing iGaming aggregator and developer of games for the online gambling sector, Relax Gaming, announced the release of its latest fishing-themed slot game. On Tuesday, the company confirmed the launch of Lure of Fortune, a new slot game that invites the players on a thrilling adventure at sea with a chance of big prizes thanks to its rewarding features.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming's newest video slot game uses the popular cluster pays mechanic and grants the players a chance to select one out of three different volatility modes. With a minimum bet of €0.10 and a maximum bet depending on the volatility, the biggest payout players have a chance to secure is 50,000x their wager.</p>
<p>To ensure constant excitement and engaging experience, Lure of Fortune offers Cascading Win, a Multiplier Upgrade, as well as a Bonus Game. The new slot game from Relax Gaming features vibrant colors, crisp sound effects and relaxing background music that perfectly matches its gameplay.</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming's Director of Casino Products, shared her excitement about the new slot game in a statement. "The fishing theme is popular amongst players around the world, and I am delighted to say we have yet again produced a slot mechanic that stands apart from anything else available in the online market today," she explained.</p>
<p>Hannah added that the new game offers an innovative mechanic that allows players to select their volatility, matching their taste. "The title is also packed with both well-known and brand-new features that we’re confident will go down a treat amongst our audiences," explained Relax Gaming's Director of Casino Products in conclusion.</p>
<p>Players of Lure of Fortune are on a mission to bring fish as close to the boat as possible. To do so, they need the help of friends such as the Persistent Spawner Fish, the Persistent Payer Worm and the Persistent Hammer Octopus.</p>
<p>The latest slot game from Relax Gaming offers Cascading Win, a functionality that is activated whenever players create a winning cluster of symbols. Once this happens, all winning symbols are removed from the reels while new symbols fall down, filling the empty positions. This engaging functionality grants a chance for subsequent payouts and continues until there are no more new wins.</p>
<p>Lure of Fortune players can access a Multiplier Upgrade "with each symbol type having a multiplier attached to it that starts at 1x and is then doubled every time that specific symbol type is included in a win," explains Relax Gaming. This feature depends on the volatility mode which can be medium, high or extremely high with the biggest potential multiplier set at the staggering 128x.</p>
