    <h1>Casino Software Myrtle Beach Boat Casino Casino Betting Online Hollywood Casino Dayton Ohio Casino J</h1>

<p>So I signed up with this casino and I have been playing their promotions and welcome bonuses.</p>
<p>About a week ago I deposited and selected their step 5 welcome bonus. This is a 250 percent match min deposit 150 rollover times 40. No max cashout. A photo of the bonus is attached.</p>
<p>When I began the promotion the wagering required amount was 25960 as you can see in photo number 2. I began playing slots and in the middle of the promotion from the wagering amount changed to 38940. I immediately let them know via chat and they said they would fix the issue.</p>
<p>Well I continued playing and completed the initial rollover over amount of 25960 with a balance of $3300 which should all be withdrawable. Well I can withdraw because they haven't fixed the issue. It's been several days and I think they are intentionally screwing me please help!</p>
