<p>Kentucky regulators on Tuesday approved temporary licenses for racetracks and mobile sportsbooks to begin accepting wagers next month.</p>
<p>On March 31, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (seated) held a ceremonial signing for House Bill 551, which legalizes sports betting in the state. This week, regulators approved retail and mobile sportsbook licenses. (Image: Gov. Andy Beshear/Twitter)</p>
<p>The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission granted 12 licenses for in-person sportsbooks at racetracks and satellite facilities around the state and eight mobile sportsbook licenses.</p>
<p>The countdown continues as we move closer to sports wagering with retail locations opening in just 16 days,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a news release. “Thank you to the KHRC commissioners for their dedication to getting this done right and getting it done in time for the opening of the NFL season.”</p>
<p>Nine in-person facilities will be available by September 7, the first day of in-person betting, while three more licensees plan to open soon.</p>
<p>Brick-and-mortar sportsbooks will be open September 7 at the following locations: Churchill Downs and Derby City Gaming in Louisville, Ellis Park in Henderson, The Mint Gaming Hall Cumberland Run in Corbin, The Mint Gaming Hall Cumberland in Williamsburg, Newport Racing and Gaming in Newport, Oak Grove Gaming and Racing in Oak Grove, The Red Mile in Lexington and Turfway Park in Florence.</p>
<p>Three additional sportsbooks will soon open at Derby City Gaming in downtown Louisville, Ellis Park in Owensboro, and Sandy’s Gaming and Racing in Ashland.</p>
<p>Mobile Betting Begins September 28</p>
<p>Mobile wagering will be available beginning on September 28. Eight mobile sportsbooks also received temporary service provider licenses: Bet365, BetMGM, Caesars, Circa, DraftKings, Fanatics, FanDuel, and Penn Sports Interactive. A service provider license also was granted to Kambi, which is partnered with Churchill Downs to run its retail facilities, but which won’t operate a mobile sportsbook.</p>
<p>Kentuckians can preregister for accounts with mobile sportsbooks starting on August 28 and begin depositing money a week later, on September 7.</p>
<p>Each mobile sportsbook operator had to partner with a racetrack in the state under the terms of Kentucky’s sports betting law. Bet365 and BetMGM partnered with Sandy’s Gaming and Racing, Caesars with The Red Mile, Circa and DraftKings with Cumberland Run and its satellite locations, Fanatics with Oak Grove, Fanduel with Turway Park and its satellite, and Penn SPorts with Ellis Park Henderson and Owensboro.</p>
<p>Catalog Coming Soon</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the Horse Racing Commission will publish a catalog of eligible events and the types of wagers bettors can place before the official launch of betting on September 7.</p>
<p>Betting is expected to be available for professional and collegiate sports for adults over the age of 18. Kentucky is one of a few states that doesn’t require bettors to be at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>Officials say they expect sports betting to raise $23 million annually once the program is fully operational. Proceeds will go toward administering the sports betting program and shoring up a state pension fund; 2.5% of the money collected will be spent addressing the effects of problem gambling.</p>
