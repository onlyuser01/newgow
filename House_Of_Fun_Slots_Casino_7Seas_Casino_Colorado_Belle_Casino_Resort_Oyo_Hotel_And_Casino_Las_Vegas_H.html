    <h1>House Of Fun Slots Casino 7Seas Casino Colorado Belle Casino Resort Oyo Hotel And Casino Las Vegas H</h1>

<p>Dear player,</p>
<p>thank you for contacting us. Guru team, apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>On the 18th of March (Saturday) you contacted the live chat agents to ask about the email promoting the weekend bonuses that were part of Horus Casino's bonus offer.</p>
<p>After inquiring why you couldn't activate the bonus, our live chat representative replied that you are not eligible to claim the bonus because your account didn't meet the midweek deposit requirement of 150â‚¬. At the time of the inquiry, you also couldn't activate the bonus because it was Saturday, and the bonus only becomes visible at 12.00am on Sunday, and remains available throughout the day until 12pm, hence the name Sunday Wager Free Bonus.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that the bonus isn't automatically activated on players accounts when the promo email is sent, the bonus becomes active if opted for in player's cashier before making a deposit.</p>
<p>Even though you were accurately informed (on Saturday 18th at 19:29) that your account is not eligible to claim the bonus according to the Bonus Terms and Conditions, you still decided to activate it on Sunday at 10:39AM. You even said you didn't trust the information provided by the Live Chat representative in the same correspondence. If Guru mods need the chat I will provide it privately.</p>
<p>Activating the bonus is solely your responsibility. In this case you did it even after being warned that your account is not eligible to claim the bonus. Aside from informing and warning you against claiming, we couldn't do more to stop you as one would expect that would be enough from deterring you and risking having a bad experience.</p>
<p>You mentioned in the complaint that you couldn't deactivate the bonus on Sunday when you made the deposit, but the bonus only becomes available if you choose to activate it before the deposit. If anything, you could have contacted our 24/7 Live Chat Support team and they would have done it for you in the same responsible and honest way as when they informed you not to claim the bonus. Instead, as per your words, you didn't see having the bonus active as an issue and continued playing.</p>
<p>Even though you acted against the Live Chat's instructions and Bonus Terms and Conditions, we still returned your deposit on your balance to have another go, this time clean from bonus restrictions.</p>
<p>We can't be held responsible for your actions, best we can do is provide accurate information to avoid unpleasant situations like this one. You should have listened to our Live Chat agents advice and this would have been avoided. Instead you decided to ignore/not believe their instructions.</p>
<p>Thank you for the understanding!</p>
<p>Jessica</p>
