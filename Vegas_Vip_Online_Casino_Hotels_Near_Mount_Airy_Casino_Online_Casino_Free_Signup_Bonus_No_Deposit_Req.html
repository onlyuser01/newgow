<p>Since the repeal of PASPA in 2018, nearly 40 US states currently offer some form of sports betting. The significant expansion of the activity and its growing popularity helped create a competitive sports betting market. In light of this, betting operators across the country try to engage with new customers by offering different promotions and sports-related information, including live streaming capabilities news, scores, odds and more.</p>
<p>An inseparable part of this process is advertising and according to a new report, the spending on TV betting advertising since the start of the football season soared. Citing estimates from EDO Ad EnGage, a recent report released by MediaPost reveals that the spending for sports gambling TV advertising increased by 10% to $237.8 million for the period between September 1, 2023, and December 26, 2023.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that betting operators relied primarily on sports-focused TV programs. “Sports gambling impressions were up 52% to a total of 20.7 billion – up from 13.6 billion a year ago, primarily due to airings more than doubling (to 59,81) versus 26,950 airings the year before,” explains the new report.</p>
<p>While a notable increase was observed in the spending for gambling ads via sports-focused programs, the estimates from EDO Ad EnGage highlighted growth in non-sports TV advertising. Reportedly, advertising via non-sports TV networks soared with American Heroes Channel seeing 4,960 airings and Discovery Life Channel hitting 2,160. Other non-sports TV networks that also caught the attention of sports betting operators include truTV (3,130 airings) and TBS (3,270 airings), among others.</p>
<p>Gambling Advertising via Certain Networks Decreases</p>
<p>In contrast, some networks saw a decline in sports gambling ads for the period September 1 through December 26. Examples include Fox which saw an estimate of $24.4 million in online sports gambling ads for the NFL in 2022, a number that decreased to $10.7 million this year. Similarly, betting operators spent $20.2 million for sports gambling ads via NBC for the aforementioned period last year. This year, that number decreased to $12.4 million.</p>
<p>Another network that posted a decrease in sports gambling TV advertising was ESPN. Last year, advertisers spent $10.2 million on such ads, a number that shrank to $6.22 million this year. It is likely that this decline was the result of more games airing via ABC, ESPN’s sister network, suggests the new report.</p>
