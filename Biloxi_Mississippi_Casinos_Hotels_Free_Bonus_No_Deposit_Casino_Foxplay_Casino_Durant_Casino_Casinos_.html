<p>Winning his lawsuit over the access to voter registration lists enables Paul Goldman, the opponent of a casino project in Richmond, to continue his campaign ahead of the ballot in November</p>
<p>An anti-casino group in Virginia can now focus its campaign efforts ahead of the November ballot after a judge’s decision related to voter registration lists. Paul Goldman is known as the founder of the No Means No Casino group in the state. He is also an experienced political analyst who rejects a proposal for a $562 million casino project. The proposed Richmond Grand Resort is planned to be constructed in South Richmond just off Interstate 95 at 2001 Walmsley Blvd and 4700 Trenton Ave.</p>
<p>Opposing the project, Goldman asked for voter registration lists from the Virginia Board of Elections. Once he was denied access to the lists, which are usually provided to committees as well as political candidates, he filed a lawsuit in Richmond city court. The aforementioned lawsuit ended in the US District Court for the Eastern District Court of Virginia where Goldman saw a major breakthrough last week.</p>
<p>On Friday, a judge sided with Goldman, ordering the Board of Elections to immediately provide him with access to the voter registration lists. The decision announced by Federal US District Court Judge Hannah Lauck effectively cleared the path for Goldman, enabling him to access the voter registration lists, something that he has been actively trying to do since August.</p>
<p>“For the reasons stated from the bench, the Court ORDERS immediate release of the lists of persons who voted under Virginia code … for the Election years 2021, 2022 and beyond to Plaintiff. The Defendants are to note on the record when Plaintiff will receive the lists,“ reads the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia’s decision from Friday</p>
<p>Refused Access to Voter Registration Lists Impacted Goldman’s Campaign</p>
<p>In an interview for the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Goldman spoke about the impact of the delay in accessing the voter registration lists. “For two months, the Attorney General’s Office has, in effect, hurt my chances of defeating the referendum by a policy they now admit can’t be legally, politically or in any way justified under the First Amendment,” he explained. Additionally, Goldman said that instead of engaging in campaigning, he had to spend money on legal fees and “do $100,000 worth of work.”</p>
<p>The court’s decision comes ahead of the ballot planned for November 7, 2023. On the ballot, Virginia residents will be able to vote for or against the proposed casino project. The upcoming ballot isn’t the first time Virginians have been asked about the Richmond casino project. Two years ago, the voting came close, nearly allowing the casino project to lift off. At the time, 51% of the voters voted against it, while 49% showed support for the project.</p>
