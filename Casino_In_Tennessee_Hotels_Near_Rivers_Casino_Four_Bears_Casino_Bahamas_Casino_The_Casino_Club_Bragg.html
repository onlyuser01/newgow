    <h1>Casino In Tennessee Hotels Near Rivers Casino Four Bears Casino Bahamas Casino The Casino Club Bragg</h1>

<p>Bragg Gaming Group is expanding its momentum in the European market through its ORYX Gaming, a provider of full turnkey solutions for the gaming market. ORYX Gaming will be building up its UK presence through a partnership with Jumpman Gaming, and the company’s brands in the targeted market.</p>
<p>Bragg’s ORYX to Power Jumpman Casinos</p>
<p>Presently, Jumpman Gaming network includes a number of real money websites in the United Kingdom. They include Eagle Spins, Buffalo Spins, Crush Wins, Lit Wins, Star Wins, Casper Games, Fever Slots, and dozens of other prominent and respected brands that provide you with a colorful and intriguing variety of games.</p>
<p>Through this partnership with Jumpman, Oryx will be able to deliver its full RGS content, including titles by in-house studios as well as premium third-party suppliers of gaming. The selection of games will come with a number of familiar and player-favorite solutions, such as jackpots and innovative slot features</p>
<p>Jumpman focuses on a number of gaming products, but its primary focus remains on casino and bingo gaming. Commenting on this partnership launch, Bragg CCO Chris Looney said:</p>
<p>“Jumpman’s stable of sites offers Bragg a comprehensive new avenue to grow our status in the UK and we are delighted with the way this agreement propels our message in the market. While we’re already well established in the UK, strengthening our presence with new partners like Jumpman is essential to maintaining our position.” Bragg CCO Chris Looney</p>
<p>Jumpman Gaming managing director Kris Kukula welcomed the opportunity to be teaming up with ORYX in a similar vein. He said that Jumpman’s websites were able to stand out from the competition by virtue of the high-quality products they were able to provide and said that this is precisely what ORYX Gaming brings to the table.</p>
<p>Adding new quality content is key to making sure that Bragg Gaming and its brands, including Oryx, as well as Jumpman, are still the go-to choice when it comes to picking iGaming options.</p>
