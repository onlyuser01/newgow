<p>Sports events around the globe continue falling off from the schedules, cancelled, suspended or postponed due to the pandemic spread of the coronavirus /Covid-19/.</p>
<p>The English Premier League and Football League have suspended all games until April 3, as Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi both tested positive for the coronavirus, and an unnamed Everton player reported with similar symptoms forced the whole squad to self-isolate.</p>
<p>“In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, government, the FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority.” Richard Masters, CEO, English Premier League</p>
<p>The Football League that is in charge of three football divisions below the Premier league followed suit and also suspended games until April 3. So did the FA Cup and Women’s Super League. On an international level, men’s friendlies with Italy and Denmark have been called off.</p>
<p>In Italy, the most severely affected from the virus country in Europe so far, Serie A top flight football championship has been cancelled until April 3, while in Spain the regular LaLiga rounds of games for the next two weeks have also been postponed. In France Ligue 1 action has been called off until further notice, while in Scotland all professional and grassroots football activities have been halted. In Germany, after initially some weekend games were supposed to go ahead behind closed doors, all action was postponed until April 2.</p>
<p>In addition, the governing body for European football, UEFA, postponed all Champions League and Europa League games due to be played next week.</p>
<p>All US Major Leagues Off</p>
<p>In the US, after earlier in the week NBA suspended its 2019-2020 season due to a Utah Jazz player testing positive, followed by Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer postponing all games and all international soccer men’s and women’s friendlies for March and April called off, the National Hockey League /NHL/ became the latest victim of the Covid-19 isolation measures that prompted the league to suspend the season.</p>
<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association decide to cancel the Division I men’s and women’s 2020basketball tournaments, including bettors’ favourite March Madness, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships.</p>
<p>Other Sports Also Hit Hard</p>
<p>Australian Gran Prix season-opening in Formula 1 has also been suspended as per the plea from drivers and team members, following the withdrawal of McLaren due to a team member testing positive for the disease.</p>
<p>The number of sports events that are being called off due to the virus global outbreak continue to grow by the minute, with cycling, curling, cricket, boxing and athletics joining the list of sports affected.</p>
