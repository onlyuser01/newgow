<p>Industry stakeholders and the public can express their thoughts on the matter by September 7</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Gaming (DGOJ), Spain’s national regulator, has launched a public consultation on the data requirements needed to update its monitoring framework. The industry will have around two months to express its thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>The DGOJ is looking to introduce further changes to the Spanish regulatory landscape, as required by new Royal Decrees on safer gambling. Until September 7, industry stakeholders and the public can express their thoughts on the matter and provide feedback to the authority.</p>
<p>The regulator needs to amend how data is regulated in order to enhance the information monitoring system and prevent gambling harm. Under the latest Royal Decree, all Spanish operators must adopt sufficient monitoring and record-keeping protocols to protect gamblers from harm. In addition, companies will be required to keep risk profiles of customers of consumers under 25.</p>
<p>The new rules seek to shield young adults from the dangers of problem gambling. Since people aged 18-25 are considered to be very vulnerable to gambling harm, Spain’s Ministry of Consumer Affairs wants companies to be extra careful with such demographics.</p>
<p>Online gambling will have to implement the new know-your-customer requirements in H2, paving the way to a safer gambling ecosystem.</p>
<p>Spain’s New Safer Gaming Measures Should Be Implemented by 2024</p>
<p>Spain approved the Royal Decree on Responsible Gaming Environments in March. The decree outlines a number of safer gambling measures that will be gradually implemented in the country.</p>
<p>In addition to closely monitoring the activity of young players, the Decree prevents operators from targeting young people with promotional offers and bonuses. The Decree furthermore requires companies to intervene within 72 hours when harmful activities are detected. Failure to comply with these rules can earn gambling companies fines of up to €50 million.</p>
<p>The DGOJ hopes to fully implement all the requirements outlined in the Decree by 2024.</p>
<p>Spain is known as one of the strictest gambling jurisdictions in Europe because of its refusal to compromise with the safety of its citizens. As a result, companies in Spain must abide by strict rules, lest they risk problems with the DGOJ.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the DGOJ is working on a cross-operator deposit limit system which it believes to be crucial for the safety of the market. As its name implies, the system would introduce self-control tools that apply to all legal platforms, encouraging players to play safely.</p>
