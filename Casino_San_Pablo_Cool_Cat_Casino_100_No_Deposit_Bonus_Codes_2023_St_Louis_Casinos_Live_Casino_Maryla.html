<p>UK Gambling Commission suspends EveryMatrix’s license</p>
<p>The watchdog opens a review into the company</p>
<p>EveryMatrix complies with the regulator fully and retains B2B license</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission has temporarily suspended EveryMatrix’s gaming license. The operator will remain active as a B2B vendor in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s License Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Online gaming vendor EveryMatrix had its license suspended by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), following a review of its business by the watchdog. Responding to the events announced on September 6, the company pledged that it would rely on the UKGC’s advice to align its operation with the regulatory statutes outlined by the monitoring body.</p>
<p>The UKGC responded that it will be carrying a full-scale business review into EveryMatrix’s gaming network as well as its customer interaction framework. Commenting on the case, EveryMatrix confirmed that its license would remain suspended until such a time it had proven to the UKGC that all steps needed for elaborating a safe gaming environment had been taken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UKGC’s official statement read as follows:</p>
<p>EveryMatrix sees this licence review as an opportunity to further strengthen its compliance processes and procedures. The company is taking the Commission’s concerns extremely seriously and has already taken swift and effective actions to address the Gambling Commission’s concerns sufficiently.</p>
<p>The regulator didn’t outright criticize EveryMatrix, pointing out that the case was an opportunity for the company to meet the compliance standards outlined by the regulator. Further, the Commission also pointed that EveryMatrix had offered a full support during the UKGC’s investigation and it had complied with all necessary social checks.</p>
<p>Nothing Personal, Just Overall Review</p>
<p>Why the suspension then? The UKGC has decided to temporarily withhold the license of the company – although no specific time-frame has been given – in order to see EveryMatrix enhancing its overall offer.</p>
<p>Moreover, the present suspension wasn’t occasioned by specific customer complaints. Rather, it was a general examination of what EveryMatrix had to offer and how social responsibility obligations could be improved, the company specified.</p>
<p>At the same time, EveryMatrix expressed hopes that the suspension would be lifted soon enough. Another think that EveryMatrix saw fit to point out was that this suspension didn’t reflect on the quality of its software. As a result, EveryMatrix continues to operate as a vendor, providing businesses with high-quality gaming solutions.</p>
<p>However, the company won’t be able to run its own gaming activities until such a time that the Commission has cleared it.</p>
<p>Recently, William Hill’s CEO Phil Bowcock stepped down from his post as the head of the company, citing that the industry has changed too much since he first arrived in the job. The UKGC has been indeed revving up its efforts to clamp down on various aspects of the gambling industry that weren’t compliant with current statutes.</p>
<p>William Hill has also been forced to shut down 700 of its gaming shops in the United Kingdom, a direct result of the FOBTs measure that reduced the maximum stakes from £100 to £2.</p>
