<p>Pariplay, the content distribution platform and a subsidiary of NeoGames SA has added Reloaded Gaming to its Ignite partner program, which will allow the supplier to use the aggregator to reach new audiences in the North American market. Pariplay has also been focusing on iGaming in the region, hoping to consolidate its standing.</p>
<p>Reloaded Gaming Becomes Latest Ignite Partner</p>
<p>Reloaded Gaming’s products will be made available through Fusion, and they bring a host of themes and opportunities to players. The games are built to encompass the full range of the experience, from casual themes to modern slots, and many more impressive titles developed by the studio and now available to operators in the five states where Pariplay is currently licensed to operate in. Reloaded Gaming CEO Robert Skogh welcomed the opportunity:</p>
<p>The Ignite program provides us with a great opportunity to get our games in front of players across the United States, through Pariplay’s partnerships with a host of leading operators. Reloaded Gaming CEO Robert Skogh</p>
<p>Reloaded Gaming will be able to benefit from Pariplay’s turnkey development network, which will bolster its creativity and development processes and secure an easier entry into the US market, the press release informs. The Reloaded products fit nicely with consumer expectations as they are built to bring maximum entertainment value, and many worthwhile features, and run smoothly on mobile.</p>
<p>The company itself has stated that it only seeks to develop top-tier games across the board which is good news for both the supplier and Pariplay. Pariplay is presently licensed in Michigan, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and it most recently obtained a license in Connecticut.</p>
<p>North America Is an Important Future Market for Pariplay</p>
<p>Across the border, Pariplay is also available in Alberta and Ontario, Canada, and it is looking to expand to five other provinces. Pariplay director of partnership Callum Harris was similarly pleased with the opportunity to pick up the pace of expansion in the United States and the only team with companies that can truly add innovation to the Ignite program and Fusion platform.</p>
<p>“Reloaded Gaming’s wide-ranging slots catalog contains every element that a player could wish for, from land-based classics to more modern feature-rich titles that have been proven to be successful in markets worldwide,” Harris concluded paying compliments to the company’s product portfolio and development practices. Pariplay recently added content by Swintt and Konami to its aggregation platform.</p>
