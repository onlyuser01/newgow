<p>Following the success of SBC Summit Barcelona 2022, SBC Events is moving forward with SBC Summit Latinoamérica, a more contained version of the event which will feature around 100 senior executives who have experience across the Latin American region, and which will invite around 1,000 delegates to attend.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted on November 1-3 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida, SBC reported. Once again, the industry meeting will focus on a number of important regional matters that concern the industry in the region, including but not limited to marketing and media partnership &amp; opportunities, lotteries, sports betting and iGaming, the role of player protection in driving business decision, and regulatory headwinds.</p>
<p>SBC CEO and Founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity to hold another prominent panel and meeting right on the tail of the SBC Summit Barcelona and said that he was looking forward to the new event. He spoke highly of the region’s potential and long-term success. Commenting, Sojmark added:</p>
<p>"All eyes are on Latin America right now. The region has been flourishing and regulating, creating profitable opportunities for the sports betting and gaming industries. Some of the brightest minds with deep knowledge of the Latin American landscape will be speaking at SBC Summit Latinoamérica this November to shed light on how to do business in this beautiful region with huge potential."</p>
<p>The speakers who will be in attendance include big industry names who have been focusing exclusively on building their presence in the region. Those include Catena Media CEO Michael Daly, Futbol Sites sports journalist and ambassador Juan Pablo Varsky, Continent8 General Manager Gabriel Szlaifsztein, and others.</p>
<p>There will be representatives from major sports organizations as well, such as CONMEBOL Ethics and Compliance Officer Graciela Garay, and more. The panels will cover a number of topics, with dedicated tracks for "Regulatory &amp; Player Protection," "Sports Betting Innovation," "Lotteries &amp; iGaming," "Marketing &amp; Media," and "Payments."</p>
<p>There is also a "Market Spotlight" track, all of which are designed to address specific areas of the industry in the region and provide the most detailed breakdown of what to expect from the industry, how to nurture it locally, and what decisions companies can make to get the utmost benefit out of it.</p>
<p>Other companies in attendance will include Betsson Group, LeoVegas, Better Collective, and hundreds of others, along with close to a thousand delegates. Make sure to stop by the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in November.</p>
